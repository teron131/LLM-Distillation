  "summary": "This document discusses how organizations are adapting to capture value from generative AI. It highlights that companies are beginning to redesign workflows, strengthen governance, and mitigate risks associated with AI. CEO oversight of AI governance is strongly correlated with higher bottom-line impact, especially in larger companies. While some elements like risk and data governance are often centralized, tech talent and solution adoption tend to be managed through hybrid models. The overall adoption of AI, including generative AI, is increasing, with larger organizations leading the way in these organizational changes.",
