  "summary": "This document discusses how Chief Operating Officers (COOs) can maximize the impact of generative AI (gen AI) and agentic AI within their organizations. It highlights that while gen AI promises significant productivity gains, many companies struggle to realize its full potential due to fragmentation and slow adoption. The COO's role is crucial in bridging this gap by defining the right operating structure, establishing robust data governance, and leading effective change management initiatives. By focusing on these three areas, COOs can ensure that AI investments translate into tangible business value and reshape how work is done across the enterprise.",
