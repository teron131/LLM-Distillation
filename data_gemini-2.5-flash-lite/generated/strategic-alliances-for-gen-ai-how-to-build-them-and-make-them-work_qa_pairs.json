  "summary": "This McKinsey Digital Practice article emphasizes that strategic alliances are crucial for companies to unlock the full value of generative AI (gen AI). Unlike traditional vendor relationships, successful gen AI partnerships require deeper collaboration, trust, and transparency. Companies should focus on cocreating solutions, engaging in joint planning with providers, and ensuring scalability, interoperability, and reusability of gen AI offerings. Ultimately, maintaining control over one's destiny by balancing provider capabilities with internal investment is key to navigating the complexities and rapid evolution of gen AI.",
