  "summary": "This McKinsey article argues that adopting Responsible AI (RAI) frameworks is a business imperative for telecommunications companies (telcos). By implementing RAI, telcos can unlock significant value, estimated at up to $250 billion globally by 2040, by improving business processes, strengthening brand reputation, and mitigating risks. The article highlights that while AI offers telcos a chance to reinvent themselves and drive growth, a lack of industry-wide RAI standards hinders widespread adoption, leaving many companies in foundational or evolving stages of implementation. Ultimately, a strategic approach to RAI, encompassing governance, technology, and operating models, is crucial for telcos to harness AI's full potential ethically and effectively.",
