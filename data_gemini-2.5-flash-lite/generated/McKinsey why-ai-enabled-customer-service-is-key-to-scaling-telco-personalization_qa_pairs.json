  "summary": "This document argues that telecommunications companies (telcos) must integrate AI-enabled customer service with their commercial marketing efforts to achieve true personalization and growth. Currently, telcos often operate these functions in silos, leading to disjointed customer experiences and missed opportunities. By creating a unified \"next-best-experience\" engine, telcos can proactively address service issues and tailor commercial offers, leading to significant improvements in customer satisfaction, revenue, and churn reduction. This integrated approach requires a robust data layer that combines commercial and service information to provide a comprehensive view of each customer.",
