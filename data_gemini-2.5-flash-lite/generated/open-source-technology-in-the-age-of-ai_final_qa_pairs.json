  "summary": "This report, a collaboration between McKinsey, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, explores the growing use of open source technology in the age of AI. A survey of over 700 tech leaders and developers reveals that open source AI solutions are widely adopted across data, models, and tools, particularly in the technology sector and among experienced developers. Organizations are satisfied with open source AI for its performance, ease of use, and cost benefits, though proprietary tools offer a faster time to value. Despite concerns about cybersecurity and compliance, the use of open source AI is expected to increase, with organizations embracing a mix of open and proprietary solutions.",
