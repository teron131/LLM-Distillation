  "summary": "This document discusses how organizations can accelerate the adoption of generative AI, noting that front-line employees often embrace new technologies faster than management. It highlights the widening gap between AI's potential and its implementation, driven by the rapid pace of AI evolution. To overcome these organizational blocks, the article proposes four key mindsets and practices. These include adopting a \"gardener's mindset\" to nurture existing innovations rather than imposing top-down plans, creating incentives that reward learning and sharing AI competencies, and fostering rapid learning through structured experimentation with clear hypotheses and a focus on documenting both successes and failures.",
