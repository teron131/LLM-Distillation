  "summary": "This document emphasizes the critical role of strategic workforce planning (SWP) in navigating the disruptions caused by generative AI and rapid technological change. It argues that organizations must treat talent with the same rigor as financial capital, using a forward-looking, data-driven approach to anticipate future skill needs and ensure the right people are in place. By prioritizing talent investments, considering both capacity and capabilities, and embedding SWP into daily operations, companies can achieve greater agility, efficiency, and long-term resilience in the evolving world of work.",
