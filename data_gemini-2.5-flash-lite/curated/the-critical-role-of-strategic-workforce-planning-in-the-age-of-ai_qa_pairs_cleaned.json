  "summary": "This document emphasizes the critical role of strategic workforce planning (SWP) in navigating the uncertainties brought by generative AI.

SWP allows companies to proactively anticipate future skill and capacity needs, enabling dynamic resource allocation and a shift away from reactive hiring and firing. The article highlights five best practices for companies to build holistic talent plans and prepare for technological disruptions.",
