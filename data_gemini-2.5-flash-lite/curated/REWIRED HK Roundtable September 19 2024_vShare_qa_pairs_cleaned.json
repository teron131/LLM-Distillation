  "summary": "This document, from a Hong Kong REWIRED Roundtable, discusses how companies can outcompete in the digital and AI age. It highlights a shift from slow, custom-built systems to modular architectures and the importance of in-sourcing for competitive advantage. The presentation emphasizes that successful digital and AI transformations require a holistic approach, embedding technology across core processes to drive continuous improvement and create hard-to-replicate competitive advantages, as seen in leading banks. Key capabilities for \"rewired\" companies include business-led roadmaps, strong delivery capabilities, talent development, and an agile operating model, with a focus on enterprise-wide innovation rather than isolated use cases.",
