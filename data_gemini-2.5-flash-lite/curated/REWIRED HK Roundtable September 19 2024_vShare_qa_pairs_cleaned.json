  "summary": "This document, from a Hong Kong REWIRED Roundtable, discusses how companies can outcompete in the digital and AI age. It highlights a shift from slow, custom-built systems to modular architectures and the importance of in-sourcing for competitive advantage. The presentation emphasizes that successful digital and AI transformations require a holistic approach, embedding technology across core processes and building capabilities for continuous improvement, as demonstrated by leading banks. Ultimately, it argues that true outperformance comes from domain transformation, not just isolated use cases, and requires C-suite alignment and a focus on building sustainable capabilities.",
