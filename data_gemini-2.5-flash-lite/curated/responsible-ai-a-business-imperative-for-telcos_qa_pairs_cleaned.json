  "summary": "This article argues that adopting responsible AI (RAI) frameworks is a business imperative for telecommunications companies (telcos). By embedding AI ethically, safely, and transparently, telcos can unlock significant new revenue streams and drive growth, potentially capturing up to $250 billion in value by 2040. While many telcos are beginning to implement AI, few have reached advanced stages of RAI maturity due to a lack of industry standards. Implementing a strong RAI framework, including maturity models and best practices, is crucial for telcos to effectively harness AI's potential while mitigating risks and building customer trust.",
