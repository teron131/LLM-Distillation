  "summary": "This report, a collaboration between McKinsey, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, explores the growing use of open source technology in the age of AI. A survey of over 700 tech leaders and developers reveals that open source AI solutions are widely adopted across data, models, and tools, with organizations in the technology sector leading the trend. While open source offers cost benefits and is valued by developers for job satisfaction, proprietary tools provide a faster time to value. Despite concerns about cybersecurity and compliance, organizations expect to increase their use of open source AI, viewing it as a crucial component for competitive advantage.",
