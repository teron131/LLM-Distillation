  "summary": "This McKinsey article discusses the evolution of telecommunications companies (telcos) towards becoming \"AI-native\" organizations. It highlights that while telcos are increasingly investing in and benefiting from AI, the focus is now shifting from initial adoption to scaling these capabilities across the enterprise. The article emphasizes the emergence of \"agentic AI\" as the next frontier, which promises to further automate workflows and create new business opportunities.
