  "summary": "This McKinsey Digital Practice article emphasizes that strategic alliances are crucial for companies to unlock the full value of generative AI (gen AI), going beyond traditional vendor relationships. It highlights that successful gen AI collaborations require deeper trust, transparency, and alignment with providers, unlike typical vendor arrangements. Key to these alliances are cocreation of tailored solutions, joint planning with shared roadmaps, and maintaining control by balancing provider capabilities with in-house investment. Companies must also prioritize providers offering scalability, interoperability, and reusability to build effective gen AI ecosystems.",
