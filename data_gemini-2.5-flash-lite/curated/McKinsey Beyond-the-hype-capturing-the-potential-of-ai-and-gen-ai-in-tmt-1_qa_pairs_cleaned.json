  "summary": "This document explores the significant economic potential of generative AI (gen AI) in the Technology, Media, and Telecommunications (TMT) sector, estimating billions in annual impact. It highlights that TMT companies must embrace gen AI to remain competitive, with telecommunications operators potentially seeing substantial gains in areas like customer care and network operations. The report emphasizes the need for an \"AI-native transformation\" focusing on technology, data, and governance, while also acknowledging challenges like talent shortages and regulatory uncertainty. Ultimately, it advises leaders to develop clear strategies, invest in AI, and manage risks to effectively capture the benefits of gen AI.",
