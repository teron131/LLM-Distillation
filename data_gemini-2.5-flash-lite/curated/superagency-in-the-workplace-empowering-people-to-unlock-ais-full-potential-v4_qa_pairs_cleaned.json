  "summary": "This report, \"Superagency in the Workplace,\" argues that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to be as transformative as the steam engine, ushering in a new era of productivity. Despite widespread investment, only 1% of companies believe they have reached AI maturity. The primary barrier to scaling AI is not employee readiness, as employees are eager to adopt and utilize AI, but rather leadership's slow pace in steering its implementation. The report emphasizes that leaders must embrace bolder ambitions and strategically integrate AI to empower employees and drive significant business outcomes, or risk falling behind.",
