  "summary": "This report, \"Superagency in the Workplace,\" argues that while AI has the potential to be as transformative as the steam engine, most companies are not yet mature in its adoption. The primary barrier to scaling AI is not employee readiness, as employees are eager to use and learn about AI, but rather leadership's slow pace in steering its implementation. The report emphasizes that leaders must embrace bolder ambitions and strategically focus on practical AI applications to empower employees and drive transformative change, rather than incremental value. Ultimately, successfully integrating AI into the workplace is a business challenge that requires leadership alignment and organizational rewiring, not a technological one.",
