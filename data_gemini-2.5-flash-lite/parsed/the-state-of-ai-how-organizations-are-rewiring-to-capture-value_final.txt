Organizations are beginning to create the 
structures and processes that lead to 
meaningful value from gen AI. While  
still in early days, companies are  
redesigning workflows, elevating  
governance, and mitigating  
more risks.   

Organizations are starting to make 

organizational changes designed to 
generate future value from gen AI, and 
large companies are leading the way. The 
latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI finds 

that organizations are beginning to take steps that drive 
bottom-line impact—for example, redesigning workflows as 
they deploy gen AI and putting senior leaders in critical roles, 
such as overseeing AI governance. The findings also show 
that organizations are working to mitigate a growing set of 
gen-AI-related risks and are hiring for new AI-related roles 
while they retrain employees to participate in AI deployment. 
Companies with at least $500 million in annual revenue 
are changing more quickly than smaller organizations. 
Overall, the use of AI—that is, gen AI as well as analytical 
AI—continues to build momentum: More than three-quarters 
of respondents now say that their organizations use AI in at 
least one business function. The use of gen AI in particular  
is rapidly increasing.

How companies are organizing 
their gen AI deployment—
and who’s in charge    

Our survey analyses show that a CEO’s oversight of AI governance—that is, the policies, 
processes, and technology necessary to develop and deploy AI systems responsibly—is one 
element most correlated with higher self-reported bottom-line impact from an organization’s 
gen AI use.1 That’s particularly true at larger companies, where CEO oversight is the element with 
the most impact on EBIT attributable to gen AI. Twenty-eight percent of respondents whose 
organizations use AI report that their CEO is responsible for overseeing AI governance, though 
the share is smaller at larger organizations with $500 million or more in annual revenues, and 17 
percent say AI governance is overseen by their board of directors. In many cases, AI governance 
is jointly owned: On average, respondents report that two leaders are in charge. 

The value of AI comes from rewiring how companies run, and the latest survey shows that, out 
of 25 attributes tested for organizations of all sizes, the redesign of workflows has the biggest 
effect on an organization’s ability to see EBIT impact from its use of gen AI. Organizations are 
beginning to reshape their workflows as they deploy gen AI. Twenty-one percent of respondents 
reporting gen AI use by their organizations say their organizations have fundamentally 
redesigned at least some workflows. 

Twenty-eight percent of respondents 
whose organizations use AI report 
that their CEO is responsible for 
overseeing AI governance.

1 The correlation analyses considered 25 attributes and the reported effect of gen AI use on organizations’ EBIT, and using the 
Johnson’s Relative Weights regression analysis yielded an R-squared of 0.20. The attributes included which leaders oversee 
AI governance at organizations, how organizations are managing the time saved by gen AI deployment (for example, assigning 
completely new activities and fewer hours to employees, reducing head count), whether organizations have fundamentally 
redesigned at least some of their workflows as a result of gen AI deployment, and whether they have adopted each of 12 
gen AI adoption and scaling best practices: 1) establishing a dedicated team to drive gen AI adoption (for example, a project 
management office, transformation office, or dedicated adoption and scaling team); 2) having regular internal communications 
about the value created by their gen AI solutions to build awareness and momentum; 3) having senior leaders who are actively 
engaged in driving gen AI adoption, including role modeling the use of gen AI; 4) embedding gen AI solutions into business 
processes effectively (for example, changing frontline employees’ processes, creating user interfaces to incorporate gen AI 
solutions); 5) establishing role-based capability training courses to make sure employees at each level know how to use gen 
AI capabilities appropriately; 6) creating a comprehensive approach to foster trust among employees in our use of gen AI (for 
example, understanding primary sources, mitigating inaccuracies); 7) having a mechanism to incorporate feedback on the 
performance of gen AI solutions and improve them over time; 8) establishing a clearly defined road map to drive adoption of 
gen AI solutions (for example, with phased rollouts across teams and business units); 9) establishing a compelling change story 
about the need for gen AI adoption; 10) tracking well-defined KPIs for gen AI solutions, enabling insights into their adoption and 
ROI; 11) establishing employee incentives that reinforce gen AI adoption; and 12) creating a comprehensive approach to foster 
trust among customers in our use of gen AI (for example, transparency on regulatory compliance, use of customer data).

The more we see organizations using AI, the more we recognize that it takes a top-
down process to really move the needle. Effective AI implementation starts with a fully 
committed C-suite and, ideally, an engaged board. Many companies’ instinct is to delegate 
implementation to the IT or digital department, but over and over again, this turns out to be a 
recipe for failure.

There are several reasons for this. The first is that getting real value out of AI requires 
transformation, not just new technology. It’s a question of successful change management 
and mobilization, which is why C-suite leadership is essential. It’s also a potentially expensive 
transformation, requiring intensive use of sometimes scarce resources and talent. A lot 
rides on how those resources are made available, and that’s an executive-level call requiring 
nuanced decision-making that reflects the balance organizations must strike between 
efficient resource use and broad empowerment—a balance that must be constantly 
reevaluated as the technology and organization evolve.

As organizations become more fluent with AI, it will essentially become embedded in all 
functions, leaving leadership to focus on higher-level tasks like impact monitoring and talent 
development rather than on implementation.

Organizations are selectively centralizing elements of their  
AI deployment 

The survey findings also shed light on how organizations are structuring their AI deployment 
efforts. Some essential elements for deploying AI tend to be fully or partially centralized  
(Exhibit 1). For risk and compliance, as well as data governance, organizations often use a fully 
centralized model such as a center of excellence. For tech talent and adoption of AI solutions, 
on the other hand, respondents most often report using a hybrid or partially centralized model, 
with some resources handled centrally and others distributed across functions or business 
units—though respondents at organizations with less than $500 million in annual revenues  
are more likely than others to report fully centralizing these elements.

use gen AI say that employees review all content created by gen AI before it is used—for 
example, before a customer sees a chatbot’s response or before an AI-generated image is 
used in marketing materials (Exhibit 2). A similar share says that 20 percent or less of gen-
AI-produced content is checked before use. Respondents working in business, legal, and

Organizations are addressing more gen-AI-related risks

Many organizations are ramping up their efforts to mitigate gen-AI-related risks. Respondents 
are more likely than in early 2024 to say their organizations are actively managing risks related to 
inaccuracy, cybersecurity, and intellectual property infringement (Exhibit 3)—three of the gen-
AI-related risks that respondents most commonly say have caused negative consequences for 
their organizations.2

use. Forty-seven percent say their organizations have experienced at least one consequence, compared with 44 percent in 
early 2024.

Respondents at larger organizations report mitigating more risks than respondents from other 
organizations do. They are much more likely than others to say their organizations are managing 
potential cybersecurity and privacy risks, for example, but they are not any more likely to be 
addressing risks relating to the accuracy or explainability of AI outputs. 

McKinsey commentary
Alex Singla

Senior partner and global coleader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey

We’ve learned a lot about generative AI over the past two years. But perhaps the most 
important lesson is this: It pays to think big. The organizations that are building a genuine and 
lasting competitive advantage from their AI efforts are the ones that are thinking in terms of 
wholesale transformative change that stands to alter their business models, cost structures, 
and revenue streams—rather than proceeding incrementally. 

Our experience helping organizations create and deploy gen AI systems also shows that it 
pays to be ambitious from the outset—pursuing end-to-end solutions to transform entire 
domains, rather than taking a piecemeal, use-case-by-use-case approach. Beginning with 
an overarching, enterprise-level transformative vision opens up possibilities down the line. 
That’s because a clear picture of where you’re going influences the data you capture and the 
models you build. You’re thinking about things like access control; security; reusability of code 
at the front end, not as an afterthought; and creating a foundational infrastructure that is well 
beyond any individual use case or domain. This allows further functionality to be deployed 
faster and more cheaply than if you go use case by use case—which, in turn, becomes a 
competitive advantage that others will have a hard time keeping up with.

Transformative thinking also forces the CEO and top team to be aligned—something that use 
case thinking does not. This is critical because successful transformations require siloed 
parts of the enterprise to come together in a single orchestrated effort—and that can typically 
only happen when the CEO and other top leaders are involved.

Respondents at larger organizations 
report mitigating more gen-AI-related 
risks than other respondents do.

Less than one-third of respondents 
report that their organizations are 
following most of the 12 adoption 
and scaling practices for gen AI.

Best practices for adoption 
and scaling can enable value,  
and companies are beginning   
to follow them

Most respondents have yet to see organization-wide, bottom-line impact from gen AI use—
and most aren’t yet implementing the adoption and scaling practices that we know from 
earlier research help create value when deploying new technologies. In a complementary 
survey in a set of developed markets, only 1 percent of company executives describe their 
gen AI rollouts as “mature.” Even though these remain early days for deployment, we are 
beginning to see the impact when these practices are employed to capture value.  

We asked respondents about 12 adoption- and scaling-related practices for gen AI and 
found that there are positive correlations on EBIT impact from each. The one with the most 
impact on the bottom line is tracking well-defined KPIs for gen AI solutions, while at larger 
organizations, establishing a clearly defined road map to drive adoption of gen AI also has 
one of the biggest impacts.

Overall, companies are in the early stages of putting these practices in place. So far, less than 
one-third of respondents report that their organizations are following most of the 12 adoption 
and scaling practices, with less than one in five saying their organizations are tracking KPIs 
for gen AI solutions. Respondents working for larger organizations are more likely to report 
using at least some of these practices (Exhibit 4). Those at larger organizations, for example, 
are more than twice as likely as their small-company peers to say their organizations have 
established clearly defined road maps to drive adoption of gen AI solutions (such as through 
phased rollouts across teams and business units) and to have established a dedicated team 
(such as a project management or transformation office) to drive gen AI adoption. Responses 
show larger organizations are also ahead on building awareness and momentum through 
internal communications about the value created by gen AI solutions, creating role-based 
capability training courses to make sure employees at each level know how to use gen AI 
capabilities appropriately, and having comprehensive approaches to foster trust among 
customers in their use of gen AI.

McKinsey commentary
Bryce Hall

Associate partner

The initial wave of excitement and novelty around generative AI is evolving into an 
intentional focus on how to create value from these technologies. Executives are rightfully 
looking for a return on their AI investments; in many cases, they are paring back their 
strategies from trying to apply gen AI everywhere to prioritizing the domains that have the 
greatest potential.

We’re now far enough into the gen AI era to see patterns among companies that are 
capturing value. One significant difference is that these companies focus as much on driving 
adoption and scaling as they do on the up-front technology development. This is not just 
hand-waving. Instead, they are following specific management practices that enable them 
to be successful—such as developing a clear road map for scaling, establishing and tracking 
KPIs, and driving change management by ensuring senior leaders are actively engaged in 
driving gen AI adoption. The fact that so many companies continue to struggle with these 
management practices is a testament to the fact that they’re not so simple to get right.

In addition, companies that report capturing value from gen AI are “rewiring” their business 
processes to effectively embed gen AI solutions while appropriately incorporating human-
in-the-loop mechanisms to validate models and outputs and effectively mitigating risks 
associated with the technology. 

AI is shifting the skills that 
organizations need

This survey also examines the state of AI-related hiring and other ways AI affects the workforce. 
Respondents working for organizations that use AI are about as likely as they were in the 
early 2024 survey to say their organizations hired individuals for AI-related roles in the past 
12 months. The only roles that differ this year are data-visualization and design specialists, 
which respondents are significantly less likely than in the previous survey to report hiring. The 
findings also indicate several new risk-related roles that are becoming part of organizations’ AI 
deployment processes. Thirteen percent of respondents say their organizations have hired AI 
compliance specialists, and 6 percent report hiring AI ethics specialists. Respondents at larger 
companies are more likely than their peers at smaller organizations to report hiring a broad 
range of AI-related roles, with the largest gaps seen in hiring AI data scientists, machine learning 
engineers, and data engineers.

Respondents continue to see these roles as largely challenging to fill, though a smaller 
share of respondents than in the past two years describe hiring for many roles as “difficult” 
or “very difficult” (Exhibit 5). One exception is AI data scientists, who will continue to be in 
high demand in the year ahead: Half of respondents whose organizations use AI say their 
employers will need more data scientists than they have now.

Many respondents expect to 
undertake more AI-related reskilling 
in the next three years than they 
conducted in the past year.

Many respondents also say that their organizations have reskilled portions of their 
workforces as part of their AI deployment over the past year and that they expect to 
undertake more reskilling in the years ahead (Exhibit 6).

Our latest survey also shows how organizations are managing the time saved by their 
deployment of gen AI. Respondents most often report that employees are spending the 
time saved via automation on entirely new activities. They also often say that employees are 
spending more time on existing responsibilities that have not been automated. Respondents 
at larger organizations, however, are more likely than others to say their organizations have 
reduced the number of employees as a result of time saved. Our analyses find that head 
count reductions are one of the organizational attributes with the largest impact on bottom-
line value realized from gen AI.

Overall, though, a plurality of respondents (38 percent) whose organizations use AI 
predict that use of gen AI will have little effect on the size of their organization’s workforce 
in the next three years. Looking at expectations by industry, survey respondents 
working in financial services are the only ones much more likely to expect a workforce 
reduction than no change. The findings show that C-level executives’ expectations 
for the workforce impact of gen AI are not significantly different from those of senior 
managers and midlevel managers. That said, when it comes to the head count impact of 
AI—including gen AI and analytical AI—C-level executives are more likely than middle 
managers to predict increasing head count.  

Looking at the expected effects of gen AI deployment by business function, respondents 
most often predict decreasing head count in service operations, such as customer care 
and field services, as well as in supply chain and inventory management (Exhibit 7). In IT 
and product development, however, respondents are more likely to expect increasing 
than decreasing head count.

Lareina Yee

Senior partner and McKinsey Global Institute director

Although we remain in the early stages of gen AI, we’re beginning to get a glimpse into 
the ways the technology is affecting the workforce. A common fear about the technology 
is that it will be a job killer, as organizations offload tasks historically done by employees to 
increasingly powerful AI platforms. But our survey suggests that this is not necessarily the 
case. In fact, a plurality of respondents anticipate no immediate change to the size of their 
workforces. And while respondents expect lower head counts in some functions—such as 
service operations and supply chain/inventory management—in other functions—including 
software engineering and product development—respondents are actually anticipating an 
increase in the number of employees. 

Meantime, the difficulty of finding AI talent, while still considerable, is beginning to ease. 
Perhaps more people are taking the initiative to enhance their own capabilities. Or it could be 
that corporate investments in upskilling are beginning to bear fruit. Both of these somewhat 
counterintuitive trends serve to reinforce the fact that we are still in the early days of the AI 
revolution—the long-term workforce effects are still only beginning to take shape.   

AI use continues to climb

Reported use of AI increased in 2024.3 In the latest survey, 78 percent of respondents say 
their organizations use AI in at least one business function, up from 72 percent in early 2024 
and 55 percent a year earlier (Exhibit 8). Respondents most often report using the technology 
in the IT and marketing and sales functions, followed by service operations. The business 
function that saw the largest increase in AI use in the past six months is IT, where the share of 
respondents reporting AI use jumped from 27 percent to 36 percent. 

Organizations are also using AI in more business functions than in the previous State of AI 
survey. For the first time, most survey respondents report the use of AI in more than one 
business function (Exhibit 9). Responses show organizations using AI in an average of three 
business functions—an increase from early 2024, but still a minority of functions.

3 The survey question asked, “In which business functions has your organization adopted AI (for example, machine learning, 
computer vision, natural-language processing)?” Eleven business functions were offered as answer choices. Organizations 
using AI are those that, according to respondents, have adopted AI in at least one business function. For the purposes of our 
research, we left “adopted” undefined. Use of AI, therefore, spans from early experimentation by a few employees to AI being 
embedded across multiple business units that have entirely redesigned their business processes.

The use of gen AI has seen a similar jump since early 2024: 71 percent of respondents say 
their organizations regularly use gen AI in at least one business function, up from 65 percent 
in early 2024.4  (Individuals’ use of gen AI has also grown. See sidebar, “C-level executives 
are using gen AI more than others.”) Responses show that organizations are most often using 
gen AI in marketing and sales, product and service development, service operations, and 
software engineering—business functions where gen AI deployment would likely generate 
the most value, according to previous McKinsey research—as well as in IT. 

While organizations in all sectors are most likely to use gen AI in marketing and sales, 
deployment within other functions varies greatly according to industry (Exhibit 10). 
Organizations are applying the technology where it can generate the most value—for 
example, service operations for media and telecommunication companies, software 
engineering for technology companies, and knowledge management for professional-
services organizations.5 Gen AI deployment also varies by company size. Responses show 
that companies with more than $500 million in annual revenues are using gen AI throughout 
more of their organizations than smaller companies are. 

Survey responses show that 
organizations are most often using 
gen AI in marketing and sales, product 
and service development, service 
operations, and software engineering.

4 The survey asked, “In which of the following business functions is your organization regularly using generative AI—that is, 
machine learning algorithms such as ChatGPT that can create new content, including audio, code, text, and images?”
5 The survey asked about use of gen AI in “Other corporate functions (for example, knowledge management),” but because most 
of the use cases described fell under “knowledge management,” we refer to this selection as such.

C-level executives 
are using gen AI 
more than others

Individual use of gen AI by our respondents also increased 
significantly in 2024, with C-level executives leading the 
way (exhibit). Fifty-three percent of surveyed executives 
say they are regularly using gen AI at work, compared with 
44 percent of midlevel managers. While we see variation in 
individuals’ use of gen AI across industries and regions, the 
data largely show widening use across the board.

An increasing share of respondents report value creation within the business units using 
gen AI. Compared with early 2024, larger shares of respondents say that their organizations’ 
gen AI use cases have increased revenue within the business units deploying them (Exhibit 
12). Respondents report similar revenue increases from gen AI as they did from analytical 
AI activities in the previous survey. This emphasizes the need for companies to have a

Overall, respondents are also more likely than in the previous survey to say they are seeing 
meaningful cost reductions within the business units using gen AI (Exhibit 13). In early 2024, 
among respondents reporting use of gen AI in specific business functions, a minority saw 
cost reductions from its use.6 The latest survey finds that, for use of gen AI in most business 
functions, a majority of respondents report cost reductions. Yet gen AI’s reported effects on 
bottom-line impact are not yet material at the enterprise-wide level. More than 80 percent of 
respondents say their organizations aren’t seeing a tangible impact on enterprise-level EBIT 
from their use of gen AI.7 

6 Use in HR was the exception, with half of respondents who reported gen AI use in HR saying it had reduced costs.
7 Seventeen percent of respondents say 5 percent or more of their organization’s EBIT in the past 12 months is attributable to 
the use of gen AI.

Michael Chui

Senior fellow

Things are moving fast in the field of AI. But even as we try to keep up with the pace of 
technological advancements, we are also learning that AI only makes an impact in the real 
world when enterprises adapt to the new capabilities that these technologies enable. That’s 
what we are hearing in our individual conversations with business leaders—and it is also 
reflected in the global data we have collected in our latest survey. 

Since our previous state of AI survey, the use of AI has continued to increase. More companies 
are using AI in a growing number of business functions. They are using gen AI to reinvent 
aspects of their enterprises: marketing and sales, product and service development, service 
operations, corporate IT, and software engineering. More of our survey respondents are 
reporting top-line and cost benefits from deploying gen AI solutions. And more respondents 
say they are using gen AI in their daily lives. Interestingly, it’s C-level executives who are 
leading in their own use, but their employees could be much more ready to use gen AI at work 
than their C-suite leaders expect. 

Organizations have been experimenting with gen AI tools. Use continues to surge, but from 
a value capture standpoint, these are still early days—few are experiencing meaningful 
bottom-line impacts. Larger companies are doing more organizationally to help realize that 
value. They invest more heavily in AI talent. They mitigate more gen-AI-related risks. We have 
seen organizations move since early last year, and the technology also continues to evolve, 
with a view toward agentic AI as the next frontier for AI innovation. It will be interesting to 
see what happens when more companies begin to follow the road map for successful gen AI 
implementation in 2025 and beyond.

About the  
research 

The online survey was in the field from 
July 16 to July 31, 2024, and garnered 
responses from 1,491 participants in 
101 nations representing the full range 
of regions, industries, company sizes, 
functional specialties, and tenures. Forty-
two percent of respondents say they work 
for organizations with more than $500 
million in annual revenues. To adjust for 
differences in response rates, the data 
are weighted by the contribution of each 
respondent’s nation to global GDP.
