Technology Trends Outlook 2025Introduction

The global technology landscape is undergoing 
significant shifts, propelled by fast-moving 
innovations in technologies. These are exponentially 
increasing demand for computing power, capturing 
the attention of management teams and the 
public, and accelerating experimentation. These 
developments are occurring against a backdrop 
of rising global competition as countries and 
corporations race to secure leadership in producing 
and applying these strategic technologies.

This year’s McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 
provides in-depth perspectives on 13—a “baker’s 
dozen”—frontier technology trends with the 
potential to transform global business. Executives 
today face a mandate to navigate rising complexity, 
scale emerging solutions, and build trust in a world 
where the lines between digital and physical and 
centralized and decentralized continue to blur. The 
insights in this report can help business leaders 
decide which of these frontier technologies are 
most relevant to their companies by demonstrating 

how others are starting to apply them today.  
These findings emerge from our analysis of 
quantitative measures of interest, innovation, 
equity investment, and talent that underpin 
each of the 13 trends and explore the underlying 
technologies, uncertainties, and questions around 
them. (For more about our research, please see  
the sidebar, “Research methodology.”)

This outlook highlights transformative trends 
that are driving innovation and addressing critical 
challenges across sectors. Artificial intelligence 
stands out not only as a powerful technology wave 
on its own but also as a foundational amplifier of 
the other trends. Its impact increasingly occurs 
via a combination with other trends, as AI both 
accelerates progress within individual domains 
and unlocks new possibilities at the intersections—
accelerating the training of robots, advancing 
scientific discoveries in bioengineering, optimizing 
energy systems, and much more. The evolution of AI 
solutions in the marketplace increasingly combines

Technology Trends Outlook 2025aspects of trends we previously analyzed 
separately as applied AI and generative 
AI, so this year, they are examined 
together.

Even as excitement about AI applications 
and their use cases builds, realizing 
AI’s full potential across sectors will 
require continued innovations to manage 
computing intensity, reduce deployment 
costs, and drive infrastructure 
investment. This will also demand 
thoughtful approaches to safety, 
governance, and workforce adaptation, 
creating a wide range of opportunities 
for industry leaders, policymakers, and 
entrepreneurs alike.

New and notable
In addition to the growing reach of AI, 
another new trend we have chosen to 
highlight in this year’s report is agentic 
AI, which has rapidly emerged as a major 
focus of interest and experimentation 
in enterprise and consumer technology. 
Agentic AI combines the flexibility and 
generality of AI foundation models 
with the ability to act in the world 
by creating “virtual coworkers” that 
can autonomously plan and execute 
multistep workflows. Although 
quantitative measures of interest and 
equity investment levels are as yet 
relatively low compared with more 
established trends, agentic AI is among 
the fastest growing of this year’s trends, 
signaling its potentially revolutionary 
possibilities. 

AI is also the primary catalyst for another 
trend we highlight this year: application-
specific semiconductors. While Moore’s 
Law and the semiconductor layer of 
the technology stack have long been 
key enablers of other tech trends, 
innovations in semiconductors have 
spiked as reflected in quantitative 
metrics such as number of patents. 
These innovations have come in 
response to exponentially higher 
demands for computing capacity, 
memory, and networking for AI training 
and inference, as well as a need to 
manage cost, heat, and electric power 

consumption. This has given rise to a 
slew of new products, new competitors, 
and new ecosystems.

Technology trends also have a variety 
of profiles along the dimensions we 
analyzed. AI is a widely applicable, 
general-purpose technology with use 
cases in every industry and business 
function—and thus lots of innovation 
and interest—and it is scaling rapidly 
across the business landscape. Quantum 
technologies have a different profile. 
Quantum computing has the potential 
for transformative impact in certain 
critical domains, such as cryptography 
and material science, and the basic 
technology continues to be developed. 
Recent announcements, particularly 
by technology giants, have sparked 
increased interest, but real-world 
business impact will require even more 
technology advancements to make 
quantum computing practical. Other 
trends and subtrends vary across the 
multiple dimensions we analyzed, 
offering different approaches—from 
watchful waiting to aggressive 
deployment—to business leaders 
depending on their industries and 
competitive positions.

From the rise of robotics and 
autonomous systems to the imperative 
for responsible AI innovations, this year’s 
technology developments underscore 
a future where technology is more 
adaptive, collaborative, and integral 
to solving global problems. This is 
illuminated by themes that cut across 
trends this year:

 — The rise of autonomous systems. 
Autonomous systems, including 
physical robots and digital agents, 
are moving from pilot projects 
to practical applications. These 
systems aren’t just executing tasks; 
they’re starting to learn, adapt, 
and collaborate. Autonomy is 
moving toward broad deployment, 
whether through coordinating last-
mile logistics, navigating dynamic 
environments, or acting as virtual 
coworkers, among other skills.

Technology Trends Outlook 2025 — New human–machine collaboration models. 
Human–machine interaction is entering a new 
phase defined by more natural interfaces, 
multimodal inputs, and adaptive intelligence. 
From immersive training environments and 
haptic robotics to voice-driven copilots and 
sensor-enabled wearables, technology is 
becoming more responsive to human intent and 
behavior. This evolution is shifting the narrative 
from human replacement to augmentation—
enabling more natural, productive collaboration 
between people and intelligent systems. As 
machines get better at interpreting context, 
the boundary between operator and cocreator 
continues to dissolve. 

 — Scaling challenges. The surging demand for 

compute-intensive workloads, especially from 
gen AI, robotics, and immersive environments, is 
creating new demands on global infrastructure. 
Data center power constraints, physical network 
vulnerabilities, and rising compute demands 
have exposed cracks in global infrastructure. 
But the challenge isn’t just technical: Supply 
chain delays, labor shortages, and regulatory 
friction around grid access and permitting are 
slowing deployments. As a result, scaling now 
means solving not only for technical architecture 
and efficient design but also for the messy, real-
world challenges in talent, policy, and execution. 

 — Regional and national competition. Global 
competition over critical technologies has 
intensified. Countries and corporations have 
doubled down on sovereign infrastructure, 
localized chip fabrication, and funding 
technology initiatives such as quantum labs. This 
push for self-sufficiency isn’t just about security; 

it’s about reducing exposure to geopolitical risk 
and owning the next wave of value creation. The 
result is a new era of tech-driven competition 
where nations have a stake  in critical industries.

 — Scale and specialization are growing 

simultaneously. Growth on these vectors is 
enabled by innovation in cloud services and 
advanced connectivity. On one hand, we 
see rapid growth in general-purpose model 
training infrastructure in vast, power-hungry 
data centers, while  on the other, we observe 
accelerating innovation “at the edge,” with 
lower-power technology embedded in phones, 
cars, home controls, and industrial devices. 
This is creating ecosystems that deliver 
massive large language models with staggering 
parameter counts, as well as a growing range 
of domain-specific AI tools that can run almost 
anywhere. Leaders will balance centralized scale 
with localized control: Think modular microgrids 
for clean energy or bespoke robotics for niche 
manufacturing.

 — Responsible innovation imperatives. As 

technologies become more powerful and more 
personal, trust is increasingly the gatekeeper 
to adoption. Companies face growing pressure 
to demonstrate transparency, fairness, and 
accountability, whether in AI models, gene 
editing pipelines, or immersive platforms. Ethics 
are no longer just the right thing to do but 
rather strategic levers in deployment that can 
accelerate—or stall—scaling, investment, and 
long-term impact. 

The following illustrations show how different 
frontier technologies can work together to provide 
innovative solutions in the future:

Technology Trends Outlook 2025After a year in which the macroeconomic 
environment and broader market weakness 
provoked significant declines in equity financing 
for technology across several of our trends, the 
investment climate for frontier technologies 
stabilized and, in many cases, rebounded in 2024. 
Levels of equity investment in trends such as cloud 
and edge computing, bioengineering, and space 
technologies increased despite the broader market 
dip in 2023, while investments in other trends, such 
as AI and robotics, dipped only to recover to higher 

levels in 2024 than they achieved two years prior. 
The two trends with the highest levels of equity 
investment, the future of energy and sustainability 
technologies and the future of mobility, declined 
overall in 2023, but the former bounced back in 
2024 (Exhibit 1). 

Our baker’s dozen of technology trends  
shaping 2025 underscores the vast potential  
of emerging technologies and the need for 
strategic alignment in an AI-powered future.

Technology Trends Outlook 2025For executives, success will hinge on identifying 
high-impact domains in which they can apply  
these trends, investing in the necessary talent  
and infrastructure, and addressing external  
factors like regulatory shifts and ecosystem 
readiness. By fostering collaboration, bridging 
ecosystem gaps, and maintaining a long-term 
vision, leaders can accelerate adoption and 
position their organizations to drive the next  
wave of technological transformation. Those  
who act with focus and agility will not only unlock 
new value but also shape the future of their 
industries and the future of today’s emerging 
frontier technologies.

The 13 tech trends
This report lays out considerations for all 
13 technology trends. For easier consideration 
of related trends, we grouped them into three 
broader categories: the AI revolution, compute 
and connectivity frontiers, and cutting-edge 
engineering. Of course, there’s significant power 
and potential in looking across these groupings 
when considering trend combinations.

To describe the state of each trend, we developed 
scores for innovation (based on patents and research 
publications) and interest (based on news and web 
searches). We also estimated the level of equity 
investments in relevant technologies and rated their 
level of adoption by organizations (Exhibit 2).

To assess the development of each of the 
13 technology trends highlighted in this 
report, we collected data on six tangible 
measures of activity: search engine 
queries, news articles, patents, research 
publications, equity investment, and talent 
demand. For each measure or vector, 
we used a defined set of data sources to 
find occurrences of keywords associated 
with each of the trends, screened those 
occurrences for valid mentions of activity, 
and indexed the resulting numbers of 
mentions on a 0–1 scoring scale relative to 
the trends studied. The innovation score 
combines the patents and research scores; 
the interest score combines the news 
and search scores. (While we recognize 
that an interest score can be inflated by 
deliberate efforts to stimulate news and 
search activity, we believe that each score 
fairly reflects the extent of discussion and 
debate about a given trend.) Investment 
measures the flows of funding from the 
capital markets  
to companies linked with the trend.  
Data sources for the scores include  
the following:

 — Patents. Data on patent filings are 

sourced from Google Patents, which 
highlights data on the number of 
patents granted.

 — Research. Data on research 

publications are sourced from  
The Lens.

 — News. Data on news articles are 

sourced from Factiva.

 — Searches. Data on search  

engine queries are sourced from 
Google Trends.

 — Equity investment. Data on private-
market and public-market capital 
raises across venture capital and 
corporate and strategic M&A, 
including joint ventures; private equity 
investments, including buyouts and 
private investment in public equity;  
and public investments, including 
IPOs, are sourced from PitchBook. 
Investment data excludes corporate 
capital and operational expenditures.

 — Talent demand. The number of job 

postings is sourced from McKinsey’s 
proprietary Organizational Data 
Platform, which stores licensed, 
de-identified data on publicly 
available professional profiles and job 
postings. Data are drawn primarily 
from English-speaking countries.

In addition, we updated the selection  
and definition of trends from last 
year’s report to reflect the evolution of 
technology trends:

 — An overarching artificial intelligence 

category replaces these four 
trends: applied AI, generative AI, 
industrializing machine learning, 
and next-generation software 
development. 

 — The agentic AI and application-specific 
semiconductors trends have been 
added since last year’s publication. 

 — Two separate trends from last year, 
electrification and renewables 
and climate technologies beyond 
electrification, have been combined 
into a single trend: future of energy 
and sustainability technologies.

The data sources and keywords have been 
updated. For equity investment insights 

into the future of space technologies 
and quantum technologies, we built on 
research from McKinsey’s Aerospace 
& Defense Practice and the Quantum 
Technology Monitor. 

Insights gathered from McKinsey 
expert interviews were utilized to assign 
enterprise-wide adoption scores (on a 1–5 
scale) for each trend, defined as follows: 

 — 1—Frontier innovation. This 

technology is still nascent, and few 
organizations are investing in or 
applying it. It is largely unproven in a 
business context.

 — 2—Experimentation. Organizations 
are testing the functionality and 
viability of the technology with small-
scale prototypes, typically without 
a focus on a near-term ROI. Few 
companies are scaling or have fully 
scaled the technology.

 — 3—Piloting. Organizations are 

deploying the technology in the first 
few business use cases, via pilot 
projects or limited implementation, to 
test its feasibility and effectiveness.

 — 4—Scaling in progress. Organizations 
are scaling the deployment and 
adoption of the technology across 
the enterprise. 

 — 5—Fully scaled. Organizations have 
fully deployed and integrated the 
technology across the enterprise. 
It has become the standard and 
is being used at a large scale as 
companies have recognized the value 
and benefits of the technology.

Agentic AI

Agentic AI is an artificial 
intelligence system capable of 
independently planning and 
executing complex, multistep 
tasks. Built on foundation 
models, these agents can 
autonomously perform actions, 
communicate with one another, 
and adapt to new information. 
Significant advancements have 
emerged, from general agent 
platforms to specialized agents 
designed for deep research. 

The trend—and why it matters
Agentic AI has quickly gone from a fringe concept 
to one of the most talked-about shifts in enterprise 
technology. It is gaining traction as organizations 
explore new ways to automate workflows and 
delegate tasks to “virtual coworkers,” rather than 
just converse with chatbots. What sets agentic AI 
apart is its ability to act in the world, often using 
digital tools, instead of simply providing outputs. 
These systems are built on top of AI foundation 
models and can autonomously plan and execute 
multistep tasks.

Imagine a customer service AI agent that can 
answer questions about products, process orders, 
and manage returns by connecting to a company’s 
logistics systems. Several companies have 
released deep-research agents that design their 
own workflows to research topics on the web and 
produce reports. More and more companies are 
using software programming agents, applying their 

multistep reasoning to write, deploy, and test code, 
given a description written in English or another 
natural language.

The benefits that AI agents deliver over other 
previous systems include the following capabilities:

 — Serving a long tail of unpredictable tasks. To 
create software that could act autonomously, 
developers previously had to painstakingly 
program step-by-step, rule-based systems. 
Many such applications had a long tail of 
exceptions to their rules, which a human had to 
address. By contrast, large language models 
(LLMs) are good at responding correctly to 
inputs they have never before encountered, 
enabling an LLM-based agent to handle a long 
tail of tasks not easily codified into preset rules.

 — Using digital tools designed for a person. 

Previously, sending or receiving data required 
custom code that would connect each new 
digital system. However, AI agents can use the 
same tools that a person would, such as a web 
browser, to “read” websites using their LLMs 
and fill out forms.

 — Receiving instructions in natural language. 

Because LLMs can process natural language, AI 
agents can be managed like virtual coworkers, 
including giving them instructions and coaching 
them on how to do their jobs better, using the 
same kind of language you would use to interact 
with a human coworker.

 — Generating work plans that can be understood 

and modified. AI agents based on LLMs 
generate work plans and, depending on their 
design, can communicate among themselves. 
Because these agents use language that 
humans can read, they can describe what 
they’re doing and be guided via feedback on 
their work plan.

The potential of agentic AI has persuaded many 
industries to explore enlisting agentic virtual 
coworkers for a variety of functions and roles.

Agentic AI

Scoring the trend

Although interest in agentic AI (as measured by news and searches) was 
relatively low in 2024, it is growing faster than in any other tech trend. 
Agentic AI patents are also increasing quickly off a small base, reflecting 
rapid development and increasing investment in this emerging field.

Latest developments 
The development of AI agents capable of 
autonomous decision-making and interagent 
communication presents exciting possibilities. 
However, the rapid progress of agentic AI 
underscores a critical need for robust governance 
frameworks to address trust, liability, and ethical 
concerns. The latest developments in agentic AI 
include the following:

 — Developers are building AI-powered, general-
purpose agent platforms. Some companies 
are adding agentic capabilities to their existing 

AI offerings, while others are building on these 
capabilities to create targeted, task-specific 
applications.1 These additional capabilities 
enable the development of agents that can 
interact with users through natural language and 
perform many different tasks. Progress is most 
rapid in fields that have more robust data sets 
for training and evaluation, such as software 
coding and mathematics. 

 — Increasingly long chains of effective multistep

have improved AI’s ability to tackle complex, 
novel tasks by breaking them into smaller steps. 
Rather than relying solely on scaling foundation 
models, developers are now deploying 
multiagent workflows in which a “manager” 
agent builds a work plan and delegates tasks to 
specialized subagents. While there is more to do 
to assure trust and security, this shift allows for 
more accurate, context-aware outputs, a major 
step forward in how AI systems reason and 
operate.2 

 — There is a new focus on agentic AI for specific 
business solutions. AI agents are increasingly 
being developed to address specific, high-value 
business problems. More specialized and tuned 
to their specific tasks, these agents reduce the 
need for users to craft complex prompts. Early 
attention has focused on the use of agentic AI 
for software development, where capabilities 
have been advancing rapidly. In addition, there 
is significant interest in AI applications that 
can deliver measurable improvements in core 
business metrics, particularly sales optimization 
and customer support automation. As this trend 
evolves, enterprises will need to balance the 
use of specialized agents in workflows with the 
potential for more general agents to execute a 
variety of tasks. 

 — Momentum behind deep-research knowledge 

agents is growing. Multiple providers are 
advancing tools that can autonomously 
conduct multistep explorations for relevant 

content, execute searches, evaluate hundreds 
of sources, and synthesize information into 
comprehensive reports. These agents reflect 
a broader shift toward using AI not just for 
retrieval but also for reasoning enabled by faster 
knowledge generation that can be scaled.3 

 — AI agents can “talk” to one another. Recent 
advances in AI include models that can 
communicate with one another and create their 
own languages.4 Neural networks can now learn 
tasks and describe them to other AI systems. 
Processing this AI-to-AI communication costs 
less than processing AI-to-human interaction. 
These developments in AI-to-AI communication 
have implications for robotics, complex problem-
solving, and other fields, though they also raise 
concerns about transparency and control.5 

 — Rising concerns about trust, governance, 

and liability are influencing the development 
and deployment of agentic AI. As AI agents 
take on more autonomous roles that include 
executing financial transactions and interacting 
across digital platforms, businesses are 
increasingly grappling with accountability and 
legal frameworks. Recent high-profile pilot 
deployments have brought these risks into 
sharper focus, especially as AI systems act 
independently across jurisdictions. Designing 
robust guardrails and providing the right 
operational context for agents will be essential 
to ensure reliability and accountability.

‘AI agents wont just automate tasks, they will reshape 
how work gets done. Organizations that learn to build 
teams that bring people and agent coworkers together will 
unlock new levels of speed, scale, and innovation.’

Adoption developments across  
the globe 
Adoption score: 2—Experimentation. 
Organizations are testing the functionality and 
viability of agentic AI with small-scale prototypes, 
typically without a focus on a near-term ROI. Few 
companies are scaling or have fully scaled the 
technology. 

Despite significant interest and investment in 
agentic AI, the technology remains largely untested 
in real-world business contexts. Many companies 
are actively testing the functionalities of AI agents 
through small-scale prototypes, but full-scale 
adoption remains limited. Given rapid advances in 
the technology, agentic AI is worth watching closely, 
as deployment and impact could accelerate quickly.

In real life
Leading AI companies are developing advances that 
facilitate the implementation of agentic AI in real-
world scenarios. 

Real-world examples involving AI-powered, 
general-purpose agent platforms include the 
following:

 — OpenAI Operator, launched in January 2025, 
is an AI agent that can autonomously perform 
various web-based tasks, such as booking 
flights, making reservations, and ordering 
groceries. Operator can navigate websites, fill 
out forms, and handle complex interactions.6 

 — Manus AI, launched in March 2025, is 
a general-purpose agent platform. It 
autonomously handles tasks like research, 
writing, and task management, acting as a 
flexible digital teammate.7 

natural-language prompt), supporting emerging 
use cases in agentic workflows.8 

The following is a real-world example involving 
multistep reasoning: 

 — McKinsey’s QuantumBlack Labs implemented 
agentic workflows to automate credit memo 
drafting for a bank. Initial results showed that 
the productivity of credit analysts increased 
by as much as 60 percent. An LLM that acted 
as a manager of multiagent systems created 
work plans and assigned tasks to specialized 
subagents for data analysis, verification, and 
output creation.9 

Real-world examples of agentic AI built for specific 
business solutions include the following:

 — Darktrace uses autonomous AI agents to 

detect and respond to complex cyberthreats 
in real time. Darktrace’s AI agents continuously 
monitor enterprise network traffic, identify 
anomalies, and decide the best course of 
action to mitigate potential damage.10 This 
approach is modeled on the human immune 
system, enabling immediate responses to 
previously unseen cyberattacks without human 
intervention. By automating routine surveillance 
and threat detection tasks, these agentic AI 
systems allow human security teams to focus on 
strategic challenges and critical interventions.

 — Salesforce’s Agentforce platform enables 

organizations to deploy autonomous AI agents 
across various business functions, enhancing 
efficiency and scalability. These agents can 
autonomously handle tasks such as resolving 
support tickets, scheduling meetings, sending 
follow-up emails, and qualifying leads.11 

 — On June 17, 2025, Google released Gemini 

 — Cursor, developed by Anysphere, is one of the

collaborator with enterprise workflows. As these systems 
gain autonomy and decision-making capabilities, it is also 
critical to invest more in figuring out how to work with 
AI when it’s seen as a colleague versus a tool. At the same 
time, we will need strong governance, transparency, and 
ethical guardrails to ensure that these agents operate with 
accountability and build lasting trust.’  

— Delphine Nain Zurkiya, senior partner, Boston

Real-world examples involving agent-to-agent 
communications include the following: 

 — Anthropic introduced the Model Context 

Underlying technologies
The technologies that power agentic AI include 
the following:

Protocol (MCP) as an open-standard, open-
source framework to standardize the way 
AI models such as LLMs integrate and share 
data with external tools, systems, and data 
sources. Google, Microsoft, Open AI, and 
many others, have announced they would 
adopt MCP.

 — Google introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) 
protocol, an open standard to facilitate 
secure collaboration between AI agents 
across vendors. Supported by more than 
50 partners, A2A enables use cases such 
as candidate sourcing and supply chain 
coordination, complementing efforts 
like MCP to unlock scalable, multiagent 
ecosystems.13  

 — Machine learning (ML). These models make 
predictions after being trained with data 
rather than following programmed rules. 

 — Natural-language processing. This type of 

ML analyzes and generates language-based 
data, such as text and speech.

 — Application layer. Typically, this is the  

interface that the end user interacts with— 
for example, chat.

 — Integration/tooling layer. Sitting between 

an application layer and a foundation model, 
this layer integrates with other systems to 
retrieve information, filter responses, save 
inputs and outputs, distribute work, and 
enable new features. Examples include

Technology Trends Outlook 2025the large-language programming framework 
LangChain and vector databases such as 
Pinecone and Weaviate.

 — Foundation models. These are deep 

learning models trained on vast quantities 
of unstructured, unlabeled data that can be 
used for a wide range of tasks out of the box or 
adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning.

 — Reasoning models. These are foundation 

models that have been trained specifically to 
execute multistep reasoning tasks, such as 
solving problems involving logic and making 
inferences beyond pattern recognition.

 — Observability tools. These are tools (for 

example, LangSmith) that enable observability 
(to gain insights into the behavior, performance, 
and decision-making processes). They monitor 
and analyze AI models throughout their life 
cycle to ensure reliability, transparency, 
and accountability.

 — Programming frameworks. Such frameworks 

are comprehensive software tool kits 
designed to facilitate the development and 
implementation of AI applications such as 
Autogen and CrewAI.

Key uncertainties
The major uncertainties affecting agentic AI include 
the following:

 — Agentic AI failure modes, such as making 
erroneous decisions or taking unintended 

actions, can raise operational risks. Additional 
risks are associated with the quality of data 
used to train these agents, drift in decision-
making models, adversarial attacks, and the 
ongoing need for human oversight to manage 
increasingly autonomous systems. 

 — The degree to which agents will be able to reach 
autonomy remains uncertain and is a subject of 
ongoing research and debate in the AI field.

Big questions about the future
Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with agentic AI:

 — What are the workforce implications of agentic 
AI at scale—which will include a combination of 
human and digital labor?

 — What trust and safety tooling and techniques will 
be needed to mitigate risks as companies adopt 
agentic AI? 

 — Is agentic AI more likely to elevate expert talent 
by automating routine tasks or to displace large 
segments of the workforce whose roles are built 
on structure and repetition?

 — To what extent should agentic AI be allowed  
to operate independently? How do we strike  
a good balance between AI autonomy and 
human oversight?

 — How can companies get ahead of their 

competitors and capture the value at scale, 
either in revenues or cost benefits, associated 
with agentic AI?

Technology Trends Outlook 202502

Artificial 
intelligence

Artificial intelligence 
refers to computer systems 
designed to perform tasks 
that typically require human 
intelligence. These systems 
leverage algorithms, data, 
and computational power 
to recognize patterns, 
make decisions, and learn 
from experiences. 

The trend—and why it matters
Artificial intelligence is no longer just a 
technological curiosity. Today, it drives tangible 
change across industries and daily life. From 
powering natural conversations and automating 
complex analyses to controlling physical systems 
such as robots and drones, AI’s influence is broad 
and deep. The most effective solutions often 
blend multiple forms of AI: generative models 
for language, analytical engines for data-driven 
insights, and increasingly, systems capable of 
autonomous decision-making and taking action 
that are called agentic AI (covered in the previous 
section of the report). This convergence is quietly 
reshaping how businesses operate and individuals 
interact with technology. 

Seventy-eight percent of organizations surveyed 
in McKinsey’s The state of AI report are using AI 
in at least one business function, and 92 percent 
of executives are planning to invest more over the 
next three years, as highlighted in our Superagency 
in the workplace report on AI.1 That said, it’s still an 
early trend, as only 1 percent of leaders say their 
companies are fully mature in their AI deployments.2 
Rapid advances in AI’s underlying capabilities over 

the past year have made the long-term potential of 
AI even more promising for businesses. The cost 
of deploying powerful models is dropping sharply, 
and a new generation of smaller, domain-specific 
models is giving more organizations and a wider 
range of devices access to AI than ever before. 

Multimodal AI, which can process and generate text, 
images, video, and audio, has opened new creative 
and scientific frontiers, enhancing the quality 
and versatility of AI-powered outputs. As a result, 
enterprises and consumers now find it easier to 
integrate AI into workflows and daily routines. The 
impact on workflows is especially visible in software 
development. The rise of natural-language-based 
tools has democratized programming so that both 
professionals and amateurs can build and prototype 
software faster than ever. Yet this acceleration also 
brings new challenges, such as managing technical 
debt and ensuring code quality as the pace of 
development quickens.

Generative AI usage, which became commercially 
available widely less than three years ago, has 
grown extremely quickly: Most of the companies 
that report using AI also state that they are 
regularly using gen AI. However, as mentioned 
above, organizations have a long way to go to 
achieve the full potential of gen AI. The big gap 
between potential and progress can be explained 
by the time required for organizations to adapt, 
develop complementary innovations, and reskill 
their workforces. Therefore, the true economic 
benefits of gen AI may become visible only after 
substantial organizational and structural changes 
have taken place. 

As we look to the year ahead, several pivotal 
questions emerge: Will lower model inference costs 
and the explosion of small, specialized models 
continue to reshape access to and benefits from 
AI? Which enterprise strategies will unlock the 
most value as organizations race to move from 
experimentation to full-scale adoption? And, as 
innovation accelerates, how can leaders ensure that 
responsible practices—around ethics, transparency, 
and governance—keep pace with AI’s rapid 
integration into business and society?

Latest developments
AI innovation in 2025 is accelerating around 
enhancing model capabilities, efficiency, and 
real-world applications, driven by competition 
among tech giants and start-ups, while the field 
increasingly grapples with responsible deployment, 
regulation, and scaling commercialization. 

Recent developments involving AI include increased 
competition and decreasing inference costs, small-
model explosion, advancements in multimodal AI 
and multistep reasoning capabilities, accelerating 
software development, concerns around 
responsible AI, and growing global investment:

 — A proliferation of foundation models has 

increased competition and driven down costs. 
Many competitors offered free access and 
reduced pricing for high-quality, text-based 
outputs, and the emergence of start-ups further 
fueled innovation. The number of high-quality 
open-source models has also increased. 

 — The AI landscape witnessed a “small-model 
explosion,” as distillation and quantization 
techniques enabled the creation of highly 
capable, domain-specific AI models derived 
from larger “parent” models. These smaller 
models deliver high-quality outputs while 
requiring much less computing power, 
dramatically reducing costs and energy

race ahead, and almost 80 percent of the companies in 
our global State of AI survey say that they are using AI. 
But capturing value at scale from AI is a journey. Only 
1 percent of companies in a complementary survey reported 
that their use of AI is fully mature. There is still a lot of 
headroom for transforming companies and industries.’

consumption. Previously, enterprises often 
used larger models, many of which could handle 
more than a trillion parameters, but many now 
recognize that smaller models, handling ten 
billion and fewer parameters, are comparably 
effective. As a result, AI is now being integrated 
into a vast array of devices and applications, 
from smartphones and household appliances to 
trucks and industrial equipment.

 — Companies are redoubling their efforts to 

develop multimodal gen AI models to integrate 
and process multiple types of data input and 
generate outputs, such as text, images, video, 
and audio. These multimodal models enhance 
natural-language interactions for more effective 
prompting and improved outputs. Multimodal 
outputs are also improving, encompassing video 
and higher-complexity scientific outputs, such as 
identifying subtle correlations between protein 
folding and drug efficacy. Gartner projects that 
by 2027, 40 percent of gen AI solutions will be 
multimodal, up from just 1 percent in 2023.3 

 — AI is getting better at complex, multistep 

reasoning, a significant shift in its capabilities. 
Recent advances enable foundation models 
to strategically plan, adapt to variability, and 
generalize knowledge across tasks, increasing 
its efficiency and reliability. Optimized training 
algorithms, deep-research tools, and other 

techniques demonstrate how AI can reason 
more quickly and apply insights to new 
challenges,4 including software engineering.

 — The industry is moving from principles to 

action on responsible AI. As gen AI adoption 
accelerates, concerns persist over plagiarism, 
accountability, data poisoning, bias, and fairness. 
The use of copyrighted material to train gen 
AI models has ignited debates on intellectual 
property rights and fair use. Concerns about a 
lack of transparency in how outputs—especially 
nonmathematical outputs—are determined have 
increased interest in “explainable AI,” which 
can articulate its reasoning. To address these 
challenges, organizations are implementing AI 
governance platforms and seeking third-party 
trust and risk evaluations. 

 — Global investment is expanding, but its 

distribution varies across regions. Sovereign AI, 
which has the potential to foster local innovation, 
economic growth, and national interests, has 
gained significant traction globally. France, Italy, 
Spain, and the United Kingdom are among the 
nations developing domestic AI infrastructure 
by fostering an ecosystem of technology firms 
and cloud and telecommunication providers.5

healthcare and natural disaster management.6 
In the Middle East, countries including the 
United Arab Emirates are rapidly positioning 
themselves through large-scale infrastructure 
projects and cross-border partnerships, such as 
Emirates NBD Bank’s recent collaboration with 
BlackRock.7 By contrast, regions such as Africa 
lag in adoption due to a lack of digitization, high 
costs, and other challenges.8 

 — VC investment in AI has surged dramatically, 
driven largely by gen AI start-ups. This influx 
of capital is spurring innovation across the 
entire AI stack, from hardware pioneers such 
as SambaNova Systems developing advanced 

chips to application-focused companies 
such as Writer creating tailored solutions for 
various industries. Corporate AI investment 
has reached an unprecedented scale, with tech 
giants and leading AI companies collectively 
directing hundreds of billions of dollars 
annually toward infrastructure, models, and 
deployments. Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, 
Meta, and Microsoft are each projected to 
spend $70 billion to more than $100 billion 
on AI-related capital expenditures in 2025, 
driven by data center expansions and custom 
silicon development.9 This massive spend, 
far exceeding early cloud investments, 
underscores AI’s strategic importance and  
fuels rapid innovation.

‘The pace of AI innovation is accelerating, with 
breakthroughs in generative and autonomous systems 
rapidly expanding what’s possible across industries. 
Today, the true differentiator is not just technical 
capability; it is the ability to rewire operating models, 
talent, and governance, embedding AI deeply into 
workflows to deliver measurable business impact. 
Organizations that move decisively from experimentation 
to scaled adoption, while building robust guardrails  
for trust and accountability, will be best positioned to 
capture AI’s transformative potential.’

Technology Trends Outlook 2025TALENT AND LABOR MARKETS

Artificial intelligence

Demand

AI talent demand continues to evolve as organizations transition from early experimentation to broader deployment. Although 
2023 saw a sizable pullback, 2024 brought renewed hiring—particularly for data scientists and engineers—as companies seek to 
embed AI more deeply into core workflows. Demand for software roles has stabilized, while growth in product and 
solution-focused positions suggests an increasing emphasis on driving business integration and user impact.

While 46 percent of leaders cite skill gaps in their workforces as a major barrier to AI adoption, and more than 20 percent of 
employees surveyed report minimal training, addressing today’s upskilling needs is only one part of the equation. As AI agents 
become more integrated into enterprise workflows, the talent landscape will continue to evolve, shifting toward capabilities that 
support human–AI collaboration. Over time, this symbiotic relationship between workers and AI will become less exceptional and 
more foundational, gradually reshaping how teams operate, how decisions are made, and how value is created within organizations.1

Technology Trends Outlook 2025Adoption developments across  
the globe 
Adoption score: 4—Scaling in progress. 
Organizations are scaling the deployment and 
adoption of AI across their enterprises. 

The value proposition of AI solutions is now widely 
established, as evidenced by the many people who 
use gen AI in their day-to-day lives. As a result, the 
integration of gen AI capabilities is increasingly 
viewed as a requirement for enterprises to remain 
competitive. Deployment is hindered by ongoing 
challenges related to data privacy, output quality, 
and ethical considerations, prompting organizations 
to adopt AI governance platforms and seek third-
party evaluations. 

In real life
Increased competition among AI providers is driving 
down costs: 

 — A wide range of industry players, such as 
Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, and new 
entrants, such as DeepSeek, have significantly 
reduced prices for their gen AI services. 
Across a set of benchmarks and performance 
thresholds, Epoch AI found inference costs are 
declining between nine times and 900 times 
a year, with a median of 50 times annually.10 
Lower prices from proprietary model providers, 
combined with ongoing innovation among open-
source alternatives, increase availability for 
developers and businesses.11 

Real-world examples of the rise of smaller and more 
efficient AI models include the following:

 — Inflection 3.0, a smaller large language model 
(LLM), reportedly achieved performance 
comparable to frontier models but using 
fewer computational resources, which could 
give businesses cost-efficient AI assistants. 
Fine-tuned versions of this model can power 
customer service chatbots that handle specific 
inquiries with conversational and empathetic 
responses.12 Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI also 
offer smaller models, labeled “haiku,” “flash,” 
and “mini,” respectively.

 — Meta’s Llama 3 8B quantized models enable 
real-time language conversion directly on 
users’ phones. Meta says these smaller models, 
used in translation apps, have improved 
accuracy while operating offline, reducing cloud 
costs and latency.13 

Real-world examples of companies redoubling 
efforts to develop multimodal gen AI models include 
the following: 

 — OpenAI’s latest flagship model, GPT-4.1, 

released in April 2025, builds on GPT-4o’s 
strong multimodal foundation with improved 
handling of extended multimodal inputs. 
Optimized for efficiency and high-volume 
front-end coding, this upgraded tool also 
reliably follows instructions and features solid 
image generation and real-time, natural voice 
interactions.

 — Claude 4, Anthropic’s latest AI model 

family, was released in May 2025. With its 
advanced abilities to integrate text and data, 
this multimodal tool performs particularly 
well at coding and document analysis. Its 
multistep reasoning skills, deep contextual 
understanding, and hybrid thinking models 
(near instant responses versus extended 
thinking) make it ideal for complex problem-
solving, including but not limited to high-level 
programming challenges.

 — Gemini 2.5, Google’s latest AI model, offers 

native multimodality with a one-million-token 
context window for enhanced reasoning and 
advanced coding tasks. It uses various input 
sources, such as text, audio, images, video, and 
even code repositories. 

 — Significant advances in Google DeepMind’s 

AlphaFold 3 can enable advances in 
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and even 
food. This multimodal AI tool accelerates the 
process of identifying and optimizing drug 
candidates by accurately predicting protein 
structures and molecular interactions. The tool 
can be used to engineer proteins and enzymes.

Technology Trends Outlook 2025Real-world examples of AI performing complex, 
multistep reasoning include the following: 

 — MIT researchers have developed a more 
efficient algorithm, MBTL, that trains 
reinforcement learning models for variable 
and complex tasks. MBTL selects a subset of 
tasks for training to maximize an algorithm’s 
overall performance across a related collection 
of tasks. MBTL models how well an algorithm 
would perform independently on a task and how 
much its performance degrades when applied 
to other tasks (generalization performance). It 
does this by first choosing the task delivering 
the most improved performance, then selecting 
additional tasks for marginal improvements. 
MBTL is between five times and 50 times more 
efficient than standard approaches.14 

 — Starting in late 2024, tech giants such as 

Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Perplexity 
began introducing advanced “deep research” 
AI tools. These AI assistants can rapidly browse 
the web, analyze vast amounts of data, and 
produce comprehensive reports, significantly 
reducing research time. This potential to 
reshape cognitive work has implications for 
knowledge workers, increasing concerns about 
output verification and displacement.

 — The newest products from Anthropic 
(Claude Code), Google (Gemini Code), 
and OpenAI (Codex) demonstrate strong 
multistep reasoning skills beyond code 
comprehension and generation. This allows 
them to handle difficult coding scenarios using 
logical deductions, breaking down tasks, and 
producing code that demonstrates a deeper 
understanding of a problem and the steps 
required to solve it. These agents can act 
semiautonomously, expanding their capabilities 
throughout a product development life cycle.

Real-world examples of the impetus for the industry 
to move from principles to action on responsible AI 
include the following:

 — Efforts are underway in the United States 
to enact legislation that would establish 
guardrails for AI, reflecting a movement within 
the tech industry known as “responsible AI.” 

For example, California’s AI Transparency Act 
(Senate Bill 942), effective January 1, 2026, 
has set a precedent by requiring providers of 
widely adopted gen AI systems to offer free 
AI detection tools and include disclosures in 
AI-generated content. 

 — On August 12, 2024, US District Judge William 

Orrick ruled that several AI companies 
were illegally storing visual artists’ works in 
their image generation systems. The ruling 
established a precedent in copyright law 
as it applies to AI-generated content that 
could influence future cases involving AI and 
intellectual property rights.

Real-world examples of innovations driven by VC and 
corporate investments in AI include the following: 

 — GitLab, a comprehensive DevSecOps 

(development, security, and operations) AI 
platform, is advancing software development 
processes. By integrating AI capabilities 
across the entire software life cycle, the 
platform enables developers to automate 
repetitive tasks and streamline workflows. 
For instance, when Ally Bank implemented 
GitLab, it increased its ability to update and 
deploy software applications by 55 percent and 
realized significant cost savings.15 

 — Regrello, an AI-first enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) platform, generates complex workflow 
applications in minutes. By streamlining 
workflows and collaboration, Regrello claims to 
reduce manual tasks by up to 45 percent.16 

 — Bolt.new, developed by StackBlitz, helps 
users create and deploy web applications 
quickly using AI. Integrated in StackBlitz’s 
browser environment, it helps users easily install 
packages and configure backends, making it 
suitable for rapid prototyping.17 

Underlying technologies
Multiple types of software and hardware power 
AI across the entire tech stack. These include 
the following:

 — Application layer. Typically, this is an interface 
with which an end user interacts, such as chat.

Technology Trends Outlook 2025 — Integration or tooling layer. Placed between an 
application layer and a foundation model, this 
layer retrieves information, filters responses, 
saves inputs and outputs, distributes work, and 
enables new features across a system. 

 — Foundation models. These deep-learning 
models, trained on vast quantities of 
unstructured, unlabeled data, can perform a 
wide range of tasks out of the box or can be 
adapted to specific tasks. 

 — Physical infrastructure. This encompasses 
hardware, such as data centers and AI 
accelerator chips, that enables computation, 
data storage, and networking.

 — Digital infrastructure. This involves using the 
digital abstraction of physical infrastructure 
to support data storage, processing, and 
computation. Digital infrastructure includes 
databases (for example, SQL and NoSQL) 
and core tech services (for example, compute, 
storage, and networking).

 — Explainable AI. This AI model increases the 

transparency and interpretability of the inputs, 
weightings, and reasoning underpinning the 
output of machine learning algorithms.

 — Machine learning (ML). ML is the process of 

training models with data rather than following 
programming rules. 

 — Computer vision. This type of ML works  

with visual data, such as images, videos, and  
3D signals.

 — Natural-language processing. This is a type  
of ML that analyzes and generates text  
and speech.

 — Deep-reinforcement learning. This type of  
ML is trained by artificial neural networks to  
use trial and error to make predictions.

 — Reasoning models. These are foundation 

models trained specifically to execute multistep 
reasoning tasks, such as solving problems 
involving logic and making inferences beyond 
pattern recognition.

Key uncertainties
The most significant uncertainties affecting AI 
include the following:

 — The potential for data leakage and other 
vulnerabilities, including to customer and 
protected data, continues to raise cybersecurity 
and privacy concerns. 

 — AI continues to raise ethical concerns about data 
governance, justice and fairness, accountability, 
and explainability.

 — A growing effort to devise regulations and 

compliance for AI could affect research on gen 
AI and its potential applications.

 — Copyright ownership and content protection 
remain an open question for open-source 
models. 

 — As training models expand exponentially and 
require more computational resources, their 
environmental impact may also increase, raising 
sustainability issues that could also potentially 
hinder innovation. 

Big questions about the future
Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with AI:

 — As technological advances continue in AI 

models, accelerators, and throughput, what 
primary use cases should companies prioritize, 
and how should companies position themselves 
to drive innovation, adapt leading solutions, or 
build proprietary capabilities? 

 — How can organizations evolve their operating 
models, talent, and governance fast enough 
to scale adoption and capture the value of AI, 
rather than merely deploying the technology?

 — How will the economics of smaller, specialized, 
and open-source AI models shift the balance of 
power away from monolithic frontier models in 
enterprise decision-making?

 — What is the appropriate corporate response 
to risks posed by AI, including data privacy 
and security, equity, fairness, compliance, and 
intellectual property protections? 

 — How will supply bottlenecks, AI infrastructure 
energy needs, and diminishing high-quality 
training data constrain the development and 
deployment of AI systems?

 — How can AI models and their decision-making 
processes become more transparent to users 
and regulators?

Application-
specific 
semiconductors

Application-specific 
semiconductors are purpose-
built chips optimized to perform 
specialized tasks. Unlike general-
purpose semiconductors, they 
are engineered to handle specific 
workloads (such as large-scale 
AI training and inference tasks) 
while optimizing performance 
characteristics, including 
offering superior speed, energy 
efficiency, and performance.

The trend—and why it matters
Few technologies are as critical to future business 
growth as semiconductors, which now shape 

innovation trajectories across sectors from 
computing to automotive. Application-specific 
semiconductors are chips optimized for performing 
specific tasks, such as graphics processing units 
(GPUs), application-specific integrated circuits 
(ASICs), and potentially, silicon-based photonics 
for compute and neuromorphic architectures. 
For their specialized workloads, these tailored 
semiconductors provide greater computing power 
and cost efficiency than general-purpose compute 
architectures, like CPUs, can deliver. 

AI workloads have driven much of the recent 
innovation in application-specific semiconductors. 
These highly customized chips have provided the 
specialized processing required for AI training 
and inference at scale and for the immense 
computational demands of AI algorithms. With 
the corresponding exponential growth in energy 
demand from AI, power efficiency has also become 
a critical performance factor, as has thermal 
management. Going forward, application-specific 
semiconductors will likely be increasingly used 
across computing memory and networking. 
As AI continues to advance, the symbiotic 
relationship between AI and application-specific 
semiconductors will continue to drive innovations 
in chip design, with emerging technologies such as 
silicon photonics.

‘While the semiconductor industry has long relied on 
global interdependence, differing geopolitical priorities 
are accelerating a shift toward regionalization and supply 
chain diversification. But this will take time, given the 
capital-intensive nature of the sector and concentrated 
points of supply. Navigating the evolving landscape will 
be essential to maintaining resilience, continuity, and 
long-term innovation across the sector.’

‘The rise of gen AI isn’t just a software revolution; it’s 
a tectonic shift in hardware demand. As models scale 
exponentially, breakthroughs in accelerated compute, 
custom silicon, high-bandwidth interconnects, and 
power-optimized system design aren’t optional. They are 
the new foundation of innovation.’

(such as training and inference), lower 
operational costs, enhance energy efficiency, 
and maintain tighter integration with their 
proprietary software stacks. Simultaneously, 
we are seeing the emergence of start-ups that 
specialize in specific workload chip design, such 
as Cerebras, Groq, and SambaNova Systems. 
CPU vendors are also developing competing 
GPU offerings, although Nvidia remains the 
market leader.1

 — Demand for higher computing capacity is 

driving data center expansions and increased 
manufacturing supply. The evolution of AI and 
exponentially growing demand for computing 
power have increased the need for more 
innovation across all areas of technology. 
McKinsey analysis suggests that, in a midrange 
scenario, demand for AI-ready data center 
capacity will rise at an average rate of 33 
percent a year between 2023 and 2030.2 This 
means that about 70 percent of total demand 
for data center capacity will be for data centers 
equipped to host workloads from AI systems by 
2030. While data center capacity is increasing, 
it needs adequate semiconductor supplies 

to scale effectively. Manufacturing capacity 
expansion requires significant planning and 
investment, but technology changes quickly, 
raising concerns about how demand will be met 
in a couple of years and how sustainable that 
demand will be, given that keeping these data 
centers open and empty isn’t viable. 

 — Geopolitical tensions affect global supply 
chains. In 2024, the global semiconductor 
market hit an all-time high, as annual sales 
surpassed $600 billion for the first time, and 
that growth is expected to continue this year. 
These chips, which are crucial for computing 
advancements, are largely manufactured in 
Asia. Some leading technology companies 
import chips, while others, such as Intel, 
maintain in-house manufacturing. Supply chain 
disruptions due to trade restrictions, tariffs, 
and market fragmentation could impact global 
semiconductor supplies. This is especially true 
as regions like the United States and Europe 
increase their focus on technology sovereignty. 
AI development and large-scale computing 
operations rely on global semiconductor supply 
for raw materials and fabrication.3

Technology Trends Outlook 2025Adoption developments across  
the globe 
Adoption score: 4—Scaling in progress. 
Organizations are scaling the deployment and 
adoption of the technology across the enterprise. 

Adoption of application-specific semiconductors 
aligns closely with the scaled adoption of artificial 
intelligence, and these technologies rely heavily on 
the hardware of these semiconductors. Top players 
have been able to establish leading positions in the 
ecosystem, while other earlier-stage companies 
and start-ups are still experimenting and piloting, 
focusing on specific needs (for example, large-scale 
AI training and inference optimization). 

In real life
Real-world examples involving the development 
of chips specifically optimized for AI training and 
inference include the following:

 — Nvidia is transitioning its complex chip-on-
wafer-on-substrate (COWOS) packaging 
technology (offered by Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing [TSMC]), moving from COWOS-
short to COWOS-long technology for new 
GPUs. This shift to COWOS-long enables the 
integration of multiple chips, including GPU 
cores and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), 
on a single substrate, resulting in better 
performance and efficiency.4 It also enables the 
stacking of up to 12 HBM3 devices at a lower 
cost and uses local silicon interconnect bridges 
and an organic interposer that functions as a 
redistribution layer to increase interconnect 
densities, as well as provides a bandwidth of 
ten terabytes per second between compute 
chiplets. These features are particularly crucial 
for Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture as the 
company increases the efficiency and power of 
its AI chip designs.5

 — Large cloud service providers are developing 

their own AI chips, competing with established 
players, like Nvidia, in the AI semiconductor 
market. Trainium3 semiconductors from 
Amazon Web Services (AWS), which assist in 
AI training, have improved performance and 
energy efficiency, and in 2024, AWS improved 
the Inf2 chip used in AI model inference.6 
Google continued to develop new versions 
of tensor processing units (TPUs) optimized 
for machine learning tasks. Its seventh-
generation TPU (Ironwood) offers five times 
more compute capacity and six times more 
HBM capacity compared with the previous 
generation (Trillium).7 Microsoft rolled out 
Maia 100 as part of a strategy to optimize its 
AI infrastructure from silicon to software to 
systems, allowing for better integration and 
performance of its AI services.8 This trend of 
in-house chip development among hyperscalers 
addresses their desires to reduce reliance

move by these companies is reshaping the 
application-specific-semiconductor landscape 
by introducing more competition, diversifying 
supply chains, and driving innovation in AI 
hardware design and performance. The data 
center accelerator market, which includes 
these custom hyperscaler chips, could increase 
markedly in coming years.

Real-world examples reflecting the surge in 
demand for AI infrastructure and the expansion of 
data centers include the following:

 — In March 2024, Micron Technology sold 

out of its HBM for the rest of 2024 and had 
allocated most of its 2025 supply because of 
intense demand from AI companies.9 Such 
unprecedented demand increases the potential 
for bottlenecks in AI GPU production, for which 
HBM is a critical component.

 — Marvell, in a live demonstration, ran a 3D silicon 
photonics engine at 6.4 terabits per second 
and having 32 channels, each supporting 200 
gigabits per second for electrical and optical 
interfaces.10 This engine integrates hundreds of 
components into its chips, including by putting 
transimpedance amplifiers and drivers on the 
same device. This first-of-its-kind engine is 
modular, enabling it to scale from 1.6 terabits 
to 6.4 terabits and beyond. Compared with 
discrete solutions, this integrated engine has a 
lower cost per bit and provides a more scalable 
option for meeting ever-increasing bandwidth 
demand.

01.00.80.40.60.2Technology Trends Outlook 2025Latest developments
Recent developments in advanced connectivity 
include the following:

 — The 5G rollout has created a foundation 

for 6G. In 2024, 5G-Advanced, or 5.5G, was 
commercialized.1 Its integrated sensing and 
communications is designed to help lay the 
foundation for 6G networks to act as large-scale 
sensor systems.2 Whereas 5G connects devices, 
focused on bandwidth, latency, and reliability, 6G 
aims to go one step further and enable sensing 
for data generation. Technical implementation 
hasn’t begun, although standardization studies 
have sparked momentum.3 

 — The network-slicing market is growing as 5G 
networks mature. The global network-slicing 
market, which provides specific performance 
characteristics across each slice of a network, 
is projected to reach $1.69 billion in 2025, 
an increase of 49.6 percent compared with 
$1.13 billion in 2024.4 Network slicing uses 
cutting-edge technologies, such as software-
defined networking and network function 
virtualization, which enable more dynamic, 
flexible, and efficient network management. By 
tailoring each slice to specific requirements, 
network slicing can reduce waste and improve 
efficiency. Customers’ demand for high-speed 
connectivity and better network solutions, 
which is spurring key players to collaborate and 
combine resources, skills, and technology, is 
helping to propel that growth. 

 — Simultaneously, the private-wireless-network 
market is picking up steam. Market size is 
projected to increase from $6.27 billion in 
2024 to $32.86 billion by 2032, a CAGR of 
23 percent.5 Together with network slicing, 
private wireless delivers flexible, tailored 
connectivity solutions that can expand coverage 
beyond local facilities where private networks 
are deployed, tapping into public networks when 
needed. Key industries such as manufacturing, 
healthcare, transportation, and logistics are 
driving growth by seeking secure, reliable, and 
dedicated wireless communication services. 

However, high investment costs and deployment 
complexity challenge the rollout of private 5G.6

 — The explosion of AI data centers has increased 
demand for fiber. From data centers to edge 
computing and smart applications, fiber optics 
enable AI with high-speed, reliable, and scalable 
infrastructure. 

 — Direct-to-satellite networks and nonterrestrial 
networks (NTNs) have become a reality. NTNs 
are wireless communication systems that 
operate above Earth’s surface via platforms 
such as satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), 
medium-Earth orbit, and geostationary orbit, 
as well as high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and 
drones. NTNs enhance global communication 
coverage and extend coverage to remote areas, 
though they aren’t expected to replace mobile 
connectivity due to the substantial up-front 
investment required. 

 — Digital twins are being used by carriers to 
enable dynamic, intelligent solutions for 
monitoring, optimization, sustainability,  
and innovation. These virtual replicas of 
physical assets and systems enable real- 
time monitoring and simulation of complex 
systems such as fiber networks and private-
wireless setups. Integrated with AI and the 
Internet of Things (IoT), they can facilitate  
the navigation of complex modern systems  
and connectivity. 

 — AI-RAN (artificial intelligence–radio access 

network) is an innovative approach to mobile 
network infrastructure that replaces traditional 
CPUs, application-specific integrated 
circuits, and field-programmable gate arrays 
with graphics processing units (GPUs). 
This transformation enables a multipurpose 
infrastructure capable of supporting both RAN 
and AI workloads, creating opportunities for 
telcos to monetize AI workloads while optimizing 
network efficiency and performance. While 
AI-RAN requires network virtualization and 
fiberization, the implementation is not cost-
prohibitive, especially in urban areas.

Apple’s reliance on external suppliers of 5G 
modems. Additionally, C1 is Apple’s most 
power-efficient modem, enabling longer 
battery life in devices such as the iPhone 16e. 
The tight integration enables a modem to 
inform a processor about network conditions, 
leading to more intelligent network-switching 
decisions. However, its use is limited to sub-6-
gigahertz 5G networks, as it prioritizes power 
efficiency over millimeter wave (mmWave) 
compatibility.23

than traditional methods, which is ideal for 
hyperscale AI infrastructure.24

 — SpaceX’s Starlink initiated its direct-to-cell 
service, enabling smartphones to connect 
directly to satellites without the need for 
specialized hardware. This service allows 
users to send messages and make emergency 
calls in remote areas lacking traditional  
cellular coverage.25

Underlying technologies
The technologies that power advanced connectivity 
include the following:

 — Optical fiber. These are physical strands of glass 
that provide the most reliable high-throughput, 
low-latency connectivity. 

 — Low-power wide-area networks. These 

wireless networks, such as narrowband IoT, 
LoRa (long range), and Sigfox, are focused on 
providing connectivity for IoT. They cover large 
areas more efficiently, using less energy at the 
end points. 

 — Wi-Fi 6 and 7. Next-generation Wi-Fi confers 
higher throughput, more control over quality 
of service, and a cellular level of security by 
tapping into less-congested frequency bands.

 — 5G and 6G cellular. These next-generation 

cellular technologies provide high-bandwidth, 
low-latency connectivity services with access 
to higher-spectrum frequency bands capable 
of handling a large amount of connected 
end points, as well as delivering low-power 
connectivity suitable for IoT. 

 — 6G sensing. Using high-frequency signals 

such as sub-terahertz and mmWave, massive 
antenna arrays, and AI, 6G networks can 
bounce signals off objects to determine their 
location, movement, composition, and even 
physiological states.

 — High-altitude platform systems. These aerial 
radio stations are located at a fixed point 20 to 
50 kilometers above Earth and can be deployed 
on lightweight aircraft to provide flexible 
capacity and access in remote locations.

 — Direct-to-handset satellite connectivity. 

Telecom company partnerships with satellite 
players allow direct access from phone to 
satellite, expanding network coverage beyond 
the reach of traditional cellular towers.

 — Internet of Things. This collective network of 
connected physical devices has sensors and 
processing capabilities to digitally monitor or 
control physical objects.

 — LEO satellites. A constellation of satellites 

orbiting at relatively low altitudes above Earth’s 
surface can connect remote or inaccessible 
locations with high-speed internet and have 
other use cases like satellite imaging.

Key uncertainties
The major uncertainties regarding advanced-
connectivity technologies include the following:

 — Reaching consensus during the 6G 

standardization process presents significant 
challenges, as differing regional priorities 
and technological agendas may lead some 
countries or regions to pursue early deployment

Cloud and edge 
computing

Cloud and edge computing 
involve distributing workloads 
across locations, from hyperscale 
remote data centers to regional 
hubs and local nodes. This 
approach optimizes performance 
by addressing factors such as 
latency, data transfer costs, data 
sovereignty, and data security.

The trend—and why it matters
The rapid evolution of AI is reshaping the 
entire cloud infrastructure landscape, from 
semiconductors to data center design. As 

enterprises increasingly deploy AI-powered 
workloads, power constraints and shifting supply 
chains have become key challenges. Surging 
demand for AI computing has compelled deeper 
collaboration among chip developers, cloud 
providers, and infrastructure manufacturers. 
Additionally, hyperscale data center capacity is 
projected to triple by 2030, underscoring the need 
for scalable and efficient resource distribution.1

To address these computing constraints, 
organizations are expanding to areas with  
more robust energy infrastructure and working 
to develop more efficient computation. While 
massive, centralized clusters still dominate  
the landscape, businesses are training and 
deploying AI models across multiple locations, 
including edge environments, to optimize 
performance, reduce latency, and improve 
resource availability. This distributed approach  
not only alleviates computational bottlenecks  
but also enhances resilience by reducing reliance 
on concentrated infrastructure.

‘Of all the things I didn’t expect this year, the resurgence 
of the sovereign-cloud debate in Europe tops the list. 
Yet the current geopolitical uncertainty has reignited 
concerns over digital autonomy, slowing down cloud 
adoption—especially in regulated sectors where 
contingency planning now includes potential workload 
repatriation. What once seemed like a closed chapter is 
now being rewritten: European technology providers 
and investors are sensing a renewed, and perhaps brief, 
opportunity to reclaim ground many had  
already conceded.’

Latest developments
Recent developments involving cloud and edge 
computing include the following:

 — The evolution of AI has disrupted all layers of 
the cloud stack, including semiconductors, 
servers, and data centers. Across the value 
chain, power constraints have increased 
because demand for computing is so high. 
McKinsey analysis suggests that global  
demand for data center capacity could rise 19  
to 22 percent annually from 2023 to 2030, more 
than tripling current demand and reaching 171 to 
219 gigawatts a year.2

 — To overcome computing constraints, 

companies are moving to new locations, 
exploring creative power solutions, and 
distributing workloads. As demand for AI grows 
exponentially, companies are relocating or 
expanding to areas with better infrastructure 
and power supply to support computing needs. 
Data centers are adopting sustainable power 
solutions; for instance, instead of relying 
primarily on uninterruptible-power-supply 
systems for backup power, data centers are 
utilizing batteries to shift energy consumption to 
off-peak hours. Companies are also optimizing 
cooling systems through innovations in liquid

cooling and AI-enabled thermal management 
to enhance energy efficiency. At the same time, 
smaller AI models help reduce computational 
demands and can often run locally or on edge 
devices. Training and inference for larger and 
more complex models can also be distributed 
across multiple clusters to spread processing 
loads, reduce latency, and improve resilience by 
being closer to data sources or end users. 

 — The cloud provider landscape continues to 

evolve. Hyperscalers’3 advances in hardware 
accessibility and investments from large 
organizations have enabled smaller players 
to enter the cloud market and grow rapidly. 
The availability of advanced computing chips, 
such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and 
specialized AI accelerators (discussed in the 
“Application-specific semiconductors” trend), 
has empowered these emerging providers to 
innovate and excel in niche areas. Using cutting-
edge hardware, the new entrants can offer 
differentiated services such as AI-optimized 
cloud platforms or edge computing solutions 

that cater to specific customer needs. This 
shift is creating new market opportunities and 
fostering competition, driving further innovation 
across the cloud industry.4 At the same time, 
some hyperscalers are planning to push the 
frontier of high-capacity data centers (two to 
five gigawatts). 

 — Increasing concerns about data security, 

privacy, and geopolitical risks have increased 
demand for locally hosted data and compute. 
Local infrastructure and sovereign clouds 
ensure that data storage and processing occur 
within specific national or regional boundaries, 
helping to safeguard regional interests. This 
simplifies compliance with local data protection 
laws and regulations, which are especially 
critical in the public sector and in industries 
such as healthcare and aerospace. Larger 
institutions, such as those in the financial sector, 
often manage a private cloud, but smaller 
organizations may need to continue to rely on 
large cloud services providers.5

‘Previous investments in cloud are paving the way for AI. 
The learnings of deploying cloud at scale are lessons to be 
applied to AI. By having a framework that first supports 
the developer community, integrating security to ensure 
it is safe and easy to use, and extending it to users, we will 
see adoption take off.’

Technology Trends Outlook 2025Adoption developments across  
the globe 
Adoption score: 4—Scaling in progress. 
Organizations are scaling the deployment and 
adoption of the technology across the enterprise. 

Many organizations across the globe have adopted 
cloud technologies, with the United States and 
Western Europe leading in adoption. However, 
as the demand for compute continues to grow, 
fully scaling the technology will be a challenge. 
Meanwhile, bottlenecks around power, hardware 
supply chain, and networks persist. Some areas of 
the globe where edge computing has not seen much 
traction, such as Africa, are lagging behind. 

 — Hybrid cooling strategies are becoming 
increasingly essential as demand for 
computing power rises. Data centers 
now combine air cooling for less intensive 
applications with liquid cooling for high-density 
racks. Microsoft has introduced a water-
efficient, closed-loop chip-level cooling system 
that eliminates water evaporation and delivers 
precise temperature control.8 Technologies 
such as HyperCool use waterless, two-phase, 
direct-to-chip cooling to handle AI GPUs up to 
2,800 watts, using 10 to 20 percent less energy 
than traditional methods.9

 — As more data centers are built, the increasing 

In real life
Evolutions in cloud and edge computing are 
enabling AI across the cloud stack, addressing 
compute and power constraints and giving rise  
to specialized cloud providers and sovereign  
cloud expansion. 

Real-world examples involving AI disrupting the 
cloud stack include the following:

 — Meta has developed specialized data center 
networks that use GPU clusters to support 
distributed AI training at scale. RDMA over 
Converged Ethernet version 2 (RoCEv2) was 
used as the internode communication transport 
for Meta’s AI capacity. The company’s network 
supports a wide range of reliable, real-world 
AI training tasks—such as ranking, content 
recommendation, and natural-language 
processing—running across its GPU clusters.6

 — The Stargate Project was announced in January 
2025 with a $500 billion investment over the 
next four years to build new AI infrastructure 
for OpenAI. Funders include MGX, OpenAI, 
Oracle, and SoftBank.7

Real-world examples of companies overcoming 
computing constraints include the following: 

power needed to operate them is becoming an 
issue in markets traditionally home to clusters 
of data centers, such as Northern Virginia 
and Santa Clara in the United States. Many 
utility companies have been unable to build 
transmission infrastructure quickly enough and 
eventually may be unable to generate sufficient 
power.10 Data centers devoted to AI models 
are being built in more remote locations in the 
United States where power is still abundant  
and grids are less strained, such as in Indiana 
and Iowa.11 Similarly, Southeast Asian countries 
like Thailand and Indonesia, and Nordic 
countries such as Finland, which are abundant  
in renewable energy, are becoming key hubs for 
AI infrastructure.12

 — As AI models become more embedded in 

everyday applications, the industry is shifting 
focus from sheer scale to efficiency. In this 
context, DeepSeek’s R1 model stands out as a 
leading example. The R1 model uses techniques 
such as multihead latent attention (MLA) and 
FP8 precision quantization to dramatically 
reduce memory and compute requirements, 
enabling high-performance inference even 
on consumer-grade hardware. This approach 
reflects a broader trend in cloud and edge 
computing: optimizing AI workloads for

Technology Trends Outlook 2025responsiveness and resource efficiency to bring 
intelligence closer to where data is generated 
and decisions are made.13

Underlying technologies
The technologies that power cloud and edge 
computing include the following:

 — Companies are distributing workloads across 
growing numbers of machines. For example, 
AWS Trainium trained the Llama 2-7B model 
on 128 servers by splitting the model across 
chips, spreading tasks among workers, and 
breaking up long sequences. This reduced 
training time and cost significantly compared 
with a single machine. Similarly, companies are 
moving to areas with better power availability or 
using edge computing to process data closer to 
its source.14

The following is a real-world example of the rise of 
specialized players:

 — CoreWeave, backed by Nvidia, has become 
a key player in cloud computing by offering 
specialized GPU-accelerated cloud services 
tailored for AI and machine learning workloads. 
It caters to niche markets such as AI model 
training and inference for start-ups and 
research institutions with high-performance 
GPUs such as Nvidia H100. The company 
has grown quickly, with revenue surging to 
$1.9 billion in 2024, a 737 percent increase year 
over year that led to an IPO in March 2025.15

Real-world examples involving the rising demand 
for sovereign clouds include the following: 

 — Oracle expanded its sovereign cloud in 2024 
to cover the European Union. This allows 
European companies to process data locally 
using Oracle’s cloud infrastructure.16

 — Delos Cloud, founded by SAP, is working with 
Arvato Systems and Microsoft to deliver a 
sovereign cloud solution tailored to the German 
public sector. The platform is designed to enable 
government agencies to distribute sensitive 
workloads securely across multiple data centers 
within Germany.17

 — Virtualization. Virtualization enables the 

creation of virtual instances of servers, storage, 
and networking, allowing for resource sharing 
and isolation.

 — Compute and serverless computing. This 

technology provides on-demand computing 
resources, including serverless models with 
infrastructure managed by cloud providers, 
which frees up developers to focus on code.

 — Containers and Kubernetes. Containers 

package applications and their dependencies 
to enable consistent deployment across 
environments, while Kubernetes manages 
container orchestration at scale.

 — APIs and microservices. APIs facilitate 

communication between cloud applications 
and services, while microservices break 
down applications into smaller, independent 
components for greater scalability and flexibility.

 — Cloud storage. This technology includes 

scalable and accessible storage solutions such 
as object storage and block storage, which help 
facilitate data management in the cloud.

 — Internet of Things (IoT) or device edge. IoT 
devices such as sensors and video cameras 
collect and process data. These devices 
often come with basic computing and storage 
capabilities.

 — On-premises or “close to the action” edge. 
These are computing and storage resources 
deployed within a premises or a remote or 
mobile location where data is generated. 

 — Operator, network, and mobile edge computing 
(MEC). These are private or public computing 
and storage resources deployed at the edge 
of a mobile or converged-services provider’s 
network and are typically one network hop away 
from enterprise premises.

with smaller footprints (usually about three 
megawatts) are located in large metro areas that 
augment the public cloud with near-premises 
computing power and storage to provide lower 
latency and greater availability. 

 — Optical fiber. Physical strands of glass provide 
the most reliable high-throughput, low-latency 
connectivity. 

Key uncertainties
The major uncertainties affecting cloud and edge 
computing include the following:

 — As chip technology advances, balancing faster 
performance with lower energy use in both 
hardware and software remains a key challenge.

 — Security remains a critical concern for cloud 
and edge computing in 2025. Organizations 
face escalating security risks due to limited 
visibility across multicloud environments and 
underinvestment in protection.

Big questions about the future
Companies and leaders can consider the following 
questions when moving forward with cloud and 
edge computing:

 — How can cloud providers effectively reduce their 
energy consumption and carbon footprint?

 — How can companies ensure data sovereignty 
and compliance with evolving regulations 
in multicloud environments? Will regionally 
dominant cloud providers emerge?

 — Regulatory scrutiny and data privacy concerns 

are spurring more emphasis on cloud 
governance and data sovereignty. 

 — What will define competitive advantage in 
the cloud over the next five years—scale, 
architecture, or ecosystem control?

 — The environmental and sustainability impact 

of accelerating data center expansions, power 
sourcing, water usage, and electronic waste 
could lead to additional regulations.

 — As cost curves, tariffs, and regulatory pressures 
evolve, how should organizations dynamically 
optimize their workloads across cloud, edge, and 
on-premises platforms?

encompass augmented reality 
(AR) and virtual reality (VR) 
and include AR smart glasses, 
advanced haptic feedback, and 
AI-powered enhancements that 
improve rendering, tracking, 
and processing capabilities.

The trend—and why it matters
Immersive-reality technologies—including 
augmented reality (AR), which projects images 
into real-world settings, and virtual reality (VR), 

which enables interaction within fully virtual 
environments through spatial computing—have 
the potential to transform experiences across 
many industries. Such technologies continue 
to develop, with advances such as lighter, more 
affordable wearable devices, improved haptic 
technologies, and AI integration. While gaming 
and entertainment remain the sectors with the 
strongest adoption and most visible innovation,

sectors for marketing, prototyping, and simulating 
high-risk scenarios to improve training and 
safety. Personalized learning and entertainment 
applications leverage immersive reality to tailor 
experiences to individual needs, enhancing 
outcomes and procedural knowledge acquisition. 
By providing safe, controlled environments, 
AR and VR allow users to practice skills and 
experiment without real-world risks. In healthcare, 
immersive technologies support medical training 
and patient treatments. The AR/VR market saw 
steady but modest growth in 2024, with headset 
shipments increasing by 10 percent, though 
forecasts suggest growth may slow in 2025.1

‘Immersive reality is rapidly moving beyond its roots in 
gaming and entertainment to become a transformative 
force across industries. As the technology matures, 
organizations that thoughtfully integrate AR and VR 
into their operations will unlock new dimensions of 
productivity, creativity, and human connection. The 
next wave of innovation will be defined not just by 
technical advances but also by how seamlessly immersive 
experiences can be woven into the fabric of everyday 
business and life.’

Latest developments
Recent developments involving immersive-reality 
technologies include the following:

 — Historically, AR and VR headsets have underperformed 
expectations. This is due to high costs, limited consumer 
adoption, and technical limitations—although there is 
evidence of renewed investment, such as Meta’s AI glasses 
and Google’s Android XR glasses.2

 — Haptic advancements are blurring the line between reality 
and simulations. The integration of haptic technology and 
advanced sensory feedback is creating more immersive 
and realistic virtual environments. Ultra-low-power haptic 
actuators and wearable gloves and suits provide precise 

tactile feedback, simulating sensations like raindrops or 
texture. Chemical sensors and wireless dispensers can 
replicate flavors. This multisensory approach can elevate 
user engagement across various applications. 

 — AI integration is revolutionizing AR and VR technologies, 

enhancing rendering, tracking, and processing 
capabilities, especially in gaming and training simulations. 
AI algorithms generate hyperrealistic environments and

Technology Trends Outlook 2025Adoption developments 
across the globe 
Adoption score: 2—Experimentation. 
Organizations are testing the functionality and 
viability of the technology with small-scale 
prototypes, typically without a focus on a near-
term ROI. Few companies are scaling or have fully 
scaled the technology.

The adoption of immersive-reality technologies is 
highly variable across geographies and use cases. 
While smart glasses have gained meaningful 
traction, headset adoption has been slower than 
anticipated. Momentum is building in sectors like 
healthcare and consumer goods, yet widespread 
scale remains constrained by usability issues, high 
costs, and regional disparities in infrastructure  
and innovation.

In real life
Real-world examples involving the use of wearable 
devices include the following:

 — Helping to bridge the gap between physical 
presence and digital interaction. Despite the 
company’s subsequent decision to discontinue 
production of the initial model, Apple’s Vision 
Pro headset, first shipped in early 2024, marked 
a milestone in the immersive-reality technology 
market. Among its features is “Persona,” which 
uses AI and AR to scan a user’s face and create 
a realistic digital avatar for FaceTime calls, 
allowing users to communicate more naturally in 
virtual environments.4

 — Broadening the perspective of smart glasses. 
Expanding the field of vision is considered 
important for the growth of AR, and the fifth 
generation of Snap’s Spectacles, released 
in September 2024, makes progress in that 
direction. The product, which is primarily 
targeted at AR developers, has a more 
immersive display, with more intense colors and 

a wider 46° diagonal field of view, as well as 
extended battery life and enhanced processing 
power.5 Despite these improvements, the 
category still faces challenges like relatively 
limited fields of view and heavy device weights.

 — Making VR more immersive and accessible to 
casual users and enterprise applications. The 
ambitious visions of VR headsets have been 
limited by technical challenges. Products like the 
Meta Quest 3, a stand-alone headset launched 
in 2023, marked another step forward in the 
evolution of immersive hardware. In addition to 
not requiring a constant connection to external 
PCs or consoles, it features improved graphics, 
processing power, and rendering capabilities.6

 — Dr. Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo performed the 
first-ever mixed-reality-navigated shoulder 
replacement surgery at the Mayo Clinic in 
2024. This innovative approach to surgery used 
specially designed tools and goggles to create 
a highly accurate hologram of the joint, allowing 
for greater precision in placing the implant.7

 — Reducing the time it takes to build a prototype. 

Physical prototypes typically require 45 
days, but New Balance used VR to shorten 
that process to just seven days or less. This 
VR-based approach enables decision-makers 
to view shoe designs from all angles in a virtual 
environment, comparable to handling physical 
samples. The use of VR in this context has made 
it easier to communicate design intent and 
enabled more informed decision-making.8

Real-world examples of how haptic and other 
sensory technology are enhancing virtual 
experiences include the following:

 — A more realistic and engaging gaming 

experience. Virtuix has launched the Omni 
One, its consumer-focused, multidirectional 
VR treadmill that allows users to move in any 
direction within virtual spaces. This 360°

area in the immersive-reality-technology sector. 
One recent innovation models the work of taste 
buds. Developed by researchers at Ohio State 
University, e-Taste technology uses chemical 
sensors and wireless microfluidic actuators to 
replicate sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami 
tastes via a controlled release of ions and flavor 
compounds. Human trials achieved 70 percent 
accuracy in distinguishing taste intensities.11

Real-world examples of how AI is transforming 
immersive-reality applications include the 
following:

 — Skybox AI, developed by Blockade Labs, is 
an advanced AI-powered tool for creating 
immersive 360° panoramic environments. 
Users can generate detailed 8K-resolution 
skyboxes from simple text prompts and remix 
existing environments, edit elements, and even 
convert 2D skyboxes into 3D models for use in 
various applications. This technology can be 
applied in gaming, VR, simulations, education, 
and more.12

 — Creating gaming NPCs reaches a new level

Underlying technologies
The technologies that power immersive reality 
include the following:

 — Augmented reality. AR enables partial 

immersion by adding information to real-world 
settings.

 — Virtual reality. VR immerses users in entirely 

virtual settings.

 — Mixed reality. Mixed reality enables a level of 

immersion between AR and VR, adding virtual 
elements to the real world so that users can 
interact with both.

 — Spatial computing. This type of computing uses 
the perceived 3D physical space around the 
user as a canvas for a user interface.

 — Wearable and external sensors. These sensors, 
embedded in handheld or wearable devices 
or mounted around users, detect objects and 
bodies for representation in virtual settings.

 — Haptics. These feedback devices convey 
sensations to users, usually as vibrations.

 — Location-based augmented reality. This 

software integrates a user’s real-time physical 
location and surroundings into AR to overlay the 
surrounding physical environment in the virtual 
environment.

 — Machine learning. This term refers to models 
that make predictions after being trained with 
data rather than following programmed rules.

 — Artificial intelligence. AI refers to the capability 
of machines to perform cognitive functions 
typically associated with human minds, such as 
perceiving, reasoning, learning, interacting with 
the environment, and problem-solving.

Key uncertainties
The major uncertainties affecting immersive-
reality technologies include the following:

 — Data availability and data privacy. Immersive 
technologies such as virtual and augmented 

reality collect large amounts of personal data, 
such as body movements, eye tracking, and 
how users interact with their surroundings. 
This raises serious privacy concerns. Some 
advanced AI systems can even interpret 
unconscious behavior, including eye 
movements, to guess what users are thinking 
or feeling—often without the user realizing it. 
There’s a real risk that this information could be 
misused or exposed in data breaches, making it 
critical to protect user privacy. 

 — Amplifying bias. If not implemented carefully, 
immersive technologies can reinforce existing 
social biases. For example, candidates with 
reliable internet and access to newer devices 
or dedicated VR workspaces may benefit 
more from virtual hiring processes, education 
programs, or access to public services. 

 — Physical safety. Augmented and virtual reality 
systems often limit a user’s vision of the  
real world. This creates safety concerns when 
they are used in environments that aren’t  
tightly controlled. 

 — Multiple device types. There are many different 

types of immersive tech devices, from 
independent AR and VR platforms to peripheral 
AR accessories for mobile phones. This variety 
can make it unclear which devices are best 
suited for specific tasks. As new products 
continue to emerge, users face uncertainty in 
choosing the right tools for their needs. 

 — Hardware development. Advances in hardware 
in areas such as weight, heat management, 
battery life, field of view, and motion sickness 
reduction are progressing at a varying  
pace. Some areas are moving faster than 
others, due to technical challenges or 
market demand. While steady progress can 
be anticipated, the timeline for achieving 
substantial advances across all areas 
simultaneously remains uncertain.

Big questions about the future
Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with immersive-
reality technologies:

Cybersecurity and artificial intelligence provide 
advanced defense mechanisms that protect 
against increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats. 
They can enhance threat detection, incident 
response, and overall digital resilience for  
any organization.

AI trust systems provide explainability, fairness, 
robustness, and security that build confidence 
among users and stakeholders. As AI is 
increasingly integrated into daily life and critical 
decision-making processes, the importance of 
trust cannot be overstated.

Blockchain-based tokenization systems, 
inherently built for transparency, security, and 
accessibility, could underpin innovative solutions in 
fields such as finance and healthcare. 

These technologies share the common goals 
of building digital trust and safeguarding data 
integrity. Capturing the full benefits of digital trust 
and cybersecurity requires top-down leadership 
and deliberate changes across multiple spheres  
of activity, from strategy and technology to 
enterprise capabilities.

‘The core foundations of cybersecurity—asset 
management, vulnerability management, and identity 
management—remain critical to securing a digital world 
where generative AI continues to unlock more and more 
value. Creating systems and processes in this period 
of gen AI that will provide secure customer and user 
experiences requires both maintaining foundational 
security capabilities and investing in leading technology 
to keep up with the pace of change.’

 — Geopolitical risks have intensified, posing 
significant threats to digital trust and 
cybersecurity. In this uncertain environment, 
countries are increasingly weaponizing 
technology to achieve strategic objectives, 
raising concerns about the resilience of critical 
infrastructure and data security. Critical 
infrastructure, such as satellites and undersea 
cables, have become targets, which could 
disrupt global communications, commerce,

Adoption developments across  
the globe 
Adoption score: 4—Scaling in progress. 
Organizations are scaling the deployment  
and adoption of these technologies across  
an enterprise. 

Even when cybersecurity is fully scaled across 
an organization, technological advances mean 
it must continue to evolve. AI trust technologies, 
for example, remain in the early piloting stage 
despite the rapid rollout of gen AI. A small 
number of organizations are developing bespoke 
cybersecurity solutions but most depend on 
providers to scale. The European Union has 
gotten a jump on strengthening data security and 
sovereignty with the AI Act, which imposes strict 
regulations on high-risk AI systems, requires 
transparency, and protects consumer rights.3

In real life
Real-world examples involving initiatives and 
developments that support safe and responsible AI 
usage include the following: 

 — The AILuminate v1.0 benchmark, introduced 
by MLCommons last December, is a tool that 
evaluates the propensity of large language 
models (LLMs) to respond hazardously to 
prompts. It helps identify risks such as child 
exploitation, hate speech, and indiscriminate 
weapons such as chemical, biological, 
radiological, nuclear, and explosives violations, 
providing an independent analysis of LLM risk 
to inform decision-making. MLCommons is 
currently expanding AILuminate to address risks 
in agentic AI across correctness, safety and 
control, and security.4

 — Consolidation is enabling technology 

companies to respond to consumer demands 
for more comprehensive solutions. For 
example, Cisco made its largest acquisition 
ever in March 2024, when it acquired Splunk 
for $28 billion, enhancing what it can offer its 
customers to improve threat detection and 
response by integrating Splunk’s machine 

data analytics platform into its existing 
cybersecurity portfolio.5 Five months later, 
Cisco acquired Robust Intelligence, a pioneer in 
AI application security.6

The following is a real-world example of AI-driven 
attacks targeting organizations: 

 — Voice phishing—or “vishing”—is another 

wrinkle in phishing attacks that uses voice. 
Vishing phone calls or voice messages trick 
people into giving up sensitive personal 
or financial information. According to the 
CrowdStrike 2025 global threat report, 
vishing attacks increased 442 percent in 
just six months, from the first half of 2024 to 
the second half.7 Organizations can deploy a 
multilayered defense strategy that combines 
employee education, technological safeguards, 
and proactive monitoring to combat vishing.

Real-world examples of growing regulatory focus 
include the following:

 — The US Department of Defense (DOD) 
established the CMMC (Cybersecurity  
Maturity Model Certification) 2.0 framework 
in 2024 to enhance cybersecurity among its 
defense contractors and subcontractors.  
DOD contractors and subcontractors will  
need to attain a CMMC certificate to win new 
defense contracts.

 — Regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on 
the fintech and blockchain sectors to address 
consumer protection and financial stability. The 
European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets 
(MiCA) regulation came into effect at the end 
of 2024, aiming to provide a comprehensive 
legal framework for digital assets, including 
stablecoins. This regulation is expected 
to standardize the issuance and trading of 
tokenized assets, fostering innovation while 
mitigating risks associated with digital finance.8

for a series of high-profile cyberattacks 
targeting telecommunications companies 
and other critical infrastructure. Several 
North American telecommunications 
operators were compromised in 2024, 
highlighting vulnerabilities across the global 
telecommunications infrastructure.9

 — In recent years, several sea cable outages 
seemingly aimed at disrupting internet and 
external communications have raised concerns 
about sabotage amid geopolitical tensions. 
In the past 15 months, 11 Baltic Sea cables 
have been damaged, causing major outages, 
prompting NATO to launch a program called 
Baltic Sentry to protect critical undersea 
infrastructure.10 Sea cables are costly to 
build and carry roughly 99 percent of all 
transcontinental internet traffic.11

Real-world examples of companies deploying 
tokenization include the following: 

 — JPMorgan integrated Kinexys Digital 

Payments. This digital-first blockchain solution 
was integrated with JPMorgan FX Services to 
handle foreign exchange settlements.12

 — BlackRock introduced BUIDL. This tokenized 
fund now represents over 40 percent of the 
tokenized US Treasury market.13

Underlying technologies
Digital trust and cybersecurity technologies 
include the following:

 — Digital identity. An identity consists of all the 
digital information that characterizes and 
distinguishes an individual or an entity. Self-
sovereign identity enables users to control the 
identifying information they share and with 
whom they share it. Users of passwordless 
identities can verify and authenticate 
themselves with alternatives to alphanumeric 
passwords, such as biometrics, devices and 
applications, and documents. Businesses are 
developing “converged identity” solutions, which 
bring together different dimensions of identity 
into a single platform, enabling, for example, 
continuity as a person shifts from employee to 
business partner to customer. 

 — Privacy engineering. This practice governs the 
implementation, operations, and maintenance 
of privacy to reduce privacy risks and enable 
purposeful decision-making about resource 
allocation and effective implementation of 
privacy controls in information systems. 

 — Technology resilience. This is the sum of 

practices and technical foundations necessary 
to architect, deploy, and operate technology 
safely across an enterprise environment,

Technology Trends Outlook 2025including components such as immutable 
backup and self-healing networks. 

 — Blockchains. These digitally distributed, 

decentralized ledgers exist across a computer 
network and facilitate the secure, transparent, 
and immutable recording of transactions.

 — Smart contracts. Established in immutable 

code on a blockchain, these software programs 
are automatically executed when specified 
conditions, such as terms agreed on by a buyer 
and seller, are met.

 — Tokens and digital assets. These intangible 
items include native cryptocurrencies, 
governance tokens, stablecoins, nonfungible 
tokens, and tokenized real-world and financial 
assets, including cash.

 — Decentralized applications. These applications 
operate on peer-to-peer networks, eliminating 
reliance on centralized servers. They use 
blockchain technology for data storage and 
security and cryptocurrencies for transactions 
and user engagement.

 — Artificial intelligence. AI refers to computer 

systems that use advanced algorithms and data 
analysis to perform tasks that typically require 
human intelligence, such as learning, problem-
solving, and decision-making.

 — Explainable AI. This deploys methods and 
approaches to increase transparency and 
interpretability of inputs, weightings, and 
reasoning of machine learning algorithms to 
build trust and confidence in them. 

 — Automation for governance, risk, and 

compliance (GRC). GRC tools are software 
applications and platforms designed to 
help organizations manage and streamline 
governance, risk management, and  
compliance processes.

Key uncertainties
The major uncertainties affecting digital trust and 
cybersecurity include the following:

 — The trade-off between security and usability 
is a constant challenge. Stronger security 
measures can reduce vulnerability to attacks 
but often come at the cost of slower, less user-

friendly systems. Consumer preferences and 
actual adoption patterns add another layer 
of complexity. 

 — Currently, there is no one-size-fits-all approach 
to explainability that can open the black box 
of large AI models to provide meaningful 
explanations for their outputs. Explainability 
tools need to be tailored to specific contexts 
and data, but compatibility challenges can 
interfere with efforts to update or migrate 
technologies, especially when integrating with 
legacy systems like the many fragmented point 
solutions still in use. 

 — Even as demand for computing power 

continues to rise, business doubts about the 
increasing use of data fueling that growth 
persist. Many companies have concerns about 
their confidential data being used to train LLMs, 
leading to risks of data and IP leakage, which 
can cause them to adopt more expensive, 
in-house training solutions. To mitigate 
these risks, vendors are making stronger 
commitments to data protection, including 
offering various forms of indemnity against 
IP claims.

 — Recent advances in quantum technology have 
increased concerns about the cryptographic 
systems that underpin security in blockchain 
networks. As quantum computing advances on 
an uncertain timeline, it will pose a significant 
threat to the integrity and confidentiality of data 
protected by current cryptographic algorithms.

 — Regulation of blockchain technology and 

tokenization is fragmented across jurisdictions, 
posing compliance challenges. The European 
Union has established frameworks such as 
the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, but 
other regions, including the United States, 
are still developing regulatory approaches.14 A 
lack of global standardization extends to trust 
architecture techniques and cybersecurity 
regulations, necessitating ongoing monitoring 
and adaptation of local company policies to 
ensure compliance.15 The evolving nature of 
these regulations across jurisdictions requires 
continuous vigilance from blockchain and 
tokenization companies.

Technology Trends Outlook 2025Big questions about the future
Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with digital trust 
and cybersecurity:

 — What is required to secure the growing number 
of connected devices, such as the Internet of 
Things and operational technology, in consumer 
homes? What frameworks will ensure user 
privacy in a hyperconnected world?

 — What role should governments play in 

maintaining digital trust and cybersecurity? 

 — How much will insurance incentives factor into 

enterprise decisions to invest in cyber resilience 
and digital trust?

 — How can AI be leveraged to help develop 
advanced security mechanisms that stay  
ahead of emerging threats (geopolitical, 
AI-related, quantum)?

 — How will evolving regulations and shifts in 

enterprise attitudes influence the pace and 
scale of blockchain-based tokenization?

Quantum 
technologies

Quantum-based technologies 
make use of the unique 
properties of quantum mechanics 
to execute certain complex 
calculations exponentially 
faster than classical computers, 
secure communication networks, 
and produce sensors with 
higher sensitivity levels than 
their classical counterparts.

The trend—and why it matters
Quantum technologies represent a fundamental 
leap beyond traditional computing by harnessing 
the unique principles of quantum mechanics to 
solve some difficult problems. One pillar, quantum 
computing, has the potential to enable solutions 
to specific classes of problems that are infeasible 
using classical computers, such as simulating 
quantum phenomena in chemistry or breaking some 
commonly used encryption techniques. The second 
pillar, quantum communication, could play a pivotal 

role in ensuring secure communication. Quantum 
sensing, the third pillar, enhances sensitivity, 
enabling a broader range of capabilities for specific 
use cases than conventional sensors.

Thus far, 2025 has been an eventful year for 
quantum computing, with major players like Amazon 
Web Services (AWS), Google, IBM, and Microsoft 
announcing breakthroughs in quantum chips 
and capabilities. Developments such as Google’s 
Willow chip, Microsoft’s Majorana 1 processor, 
IBM’s Quantum Heron, and AWS’s Ocelot have 
addressed key challenges like error correction 
and scalability, marking important steps toward 
more practical quantum systems. While practical 
applications of quantum computing have yet to 
be realized, significant strides are being made. 
These developments reflect ongoing progress in 
the field, as companies continue to explore the 
path from experimental research to potential real-
world applications. Quantum technologies could 
have an economic impact across the chemicals, life 
sciences, finance, and mobility industries.

To truly unlock the transformative benefits of 
quantum technologies, however, a series of 
technical challenges must be overcome, perhaps 
through collaboration between the private and 
public sectors. Companies can position themselves 
to capitalize on future breakthroughs by monitoring 
developments in quantum technologies and 
thoughtfully investing based on their potential 
relevance to challenges in their industries.

Adoption developments across  
the globe 
Adoption score: 1—Frontier innovation. This 
technology is still nascent, and few organizations 
are investing in or applying it. It is largely untested 
and unproven in a business context. 

The quantum-technology landscape is evolving 
rapidly, with both innovative start-ups and 
established tech giants announcing more 
investments and advancements. Despite this 
momentum, users remain in the exploratory 
phase, running proofs of concept and small-scale 
prototypes to assess potential applications and 
limitations. In particular, quantum computing is still 
largely focused on research and development, with 
early-stage systems primarily used for testing and 
algorithm development. Investments and strategic 
focus vary by region, supported by initiatives like the 
€1 billion Quantum Technologies Flagship in Europe 
and growing investment in places like the United 
Arab Emirates.1

In real life
Real-world examples of error correction and 
enabled scaling include the following:

 — Atom Computing recently achieved 99.6 percent 
two-qubit gate fidelity, the highest fidelity of 
neutral-atom qubits in a commercial system and 
a significant advancement in error correction 
capability.2 The company’s technology can be 
combined with Microsoft’s qubit virtualization 
system to detect and correct errors in real time, 
not just in the postprocessing period. However, 
the current limits of two-qubit gate fidelity and 
correction facility constrained computational 
strength in the demonstration. Scaling to run 
larger and more complex algorithms will therefore 
require additional improvements.3

 — Rigetti Computing and Riverlane passed 
a significant milestone in quantum error 
correction with their demonstration of real-
time, low-latency error correction on Rigetti’s 
84-qubit Ankaa-2 system. Their experiment 

marked the first successful demonstration of 
low-latency quantum error correction, enabling 
the rapid feedback essential for fault-tolerant 
quantum computing.

Real-world examples involving competition and 
advances in scaling include the following:

 — Google announced Willow, its latest 

quantum chip, which can reduce errors 
exponentially when scaling by adding more 
qubits. Reducing errors is a key challenge in 
quantum computing. Willow also performed a 
benchmark computation that would take one 
of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion 
years—vastly longer than the universe has 
existed—in just five minutes. However, the 
benchmark computation has no known real-
world applications.4

 — AWS’s Ocelot uses “cat qubit” technology, 

which speeds up and significantly reduces the 
hardware needed for quantum error correction. 
Cost is a major hurdle to scaling quantum 
computing, and Ocelot could cut costs by as 
much as 90 percent. AWS predicts Ocelot could 
accelerate the arrival of practical quantum 
computing by five years.5

 — Microsoft unveiled Majorana 1, the world’s first 
quantum processor powered by topological 
qubits, which are more stable than other qubits, 
at least theoretically. Microsoft says Majorana 
1 will enable quantum computers to solve 
meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years 
rather than decades.6

Real-world examples involving quantum hubs 
include the following:

 — IBM inaugurated its first European quantum 
data center in Ehningen, Germany. There, 
advanced processors like Eagle and Heron 
provide quantum computational power. The 
center aims to foster research and innovation 
across Europe, offering cloud-based access to 
quantum computing resources while adhering to 
regional data protection regulations.7

Technology Trends Outlook 2025 — Nvidia announced that it is building a 

quantum computing research center, the 
NVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research 
Center (NVAQC), in Boston. This initiative 
plans to advance quantum computing by 
integrating leading quantum hardware with 
AI supercomputers, a concept referred to as 
accelerated quantum supercomputing. NVAQC 
hopes to overcome some of the most pressing 
challenges in quantum computing, including qubit 
noise and the transformation of experimental 
quantum processors into practical devices, as 
well as developing techniques like quantum 
error correction and hybrid quantum algorithms.

Underlying technologies
Quantum technologies encompass the following:

 — Quantum computing. Quantum computing is 
a computing paradigm leveraging the laws of 
quantum mechanics to significantly improve 
the performance of certain applications and to 
enable new territories of computing. 

 — Quantum communication. Quantum 

communication is the secure transfer of 
quantum information across distances. 

 — Quantum key distribution (QKD). QKD is the 
use of quantum technology to securely share 
a secret key that can be used with classical 
encryption algorithms.

 — Quantum sensing. Quantum sensing uses a 

new generation of sensors based on quantum 
systems that provide measurements of various 
quantities—for example, electromagnetic 
fields, gravity, and time. Quantum sensors may 
be orders of magnitude more sensitive than 
classical sensors.

Key uncertainties
The major uncertainties affecting quantum 
technologies include the following:

 — Technical challenges include achieving the 
ability to manage a sufficient quantity and 
quality of qubits over a long enough period to 
derive meaningful computational results while 
navigating potential regulatory, technological, 
and financial barriers to adoption that are not 
yet apparent. 

 — Cost-effectiveness may take time to achieve. 
Most of the calculations that businesses 
require can be performed by traditional 
supercomputers reasonably well and at a much 
lower cost than for quantum computers. Once 
quantum advantage is achieved, costs may 
come down, but it is currently unclear which 
quantum computing components will become 
more cost-effective.

 — Quantum computing ecosystems are nascent. 
Innovation outside quantum hubs is hindered 
by limited awareness and adoption of quantum 
technologies, varying levels of technology 
maturity and applicability for different industries, 
the need for increased interdisciplinary 
coordination (for example, between academia 
and industry) to bring technologies to market, 
and continued work among quantum companies 
to find and develop talent in quantum theory, 
hardware, and software development.

 — Countries leading in quantum technology could 
revolutionize industries like pharmaceuticals, 
logistics, and cybersecurity, potentially widening 
the economic gap among nations.

Big questions about the future
Companies and leaders may want to consider  
a few questions when moving forward with 
quantum technologies: 

 — When is quantum technology likely to reach 
major milestones over the next decade, 
including full error correction, quantum 
advantage, and making feasible the defeat of 
current RSA encryption?

 — How can companies prepare now for quantum 
technology, particularly the security threats 
posed by quantum computing?

 — What impact will quantum computing have on 

decentralized finance?

 — Will the quantum talent supply catch up to 

demand? How can the private and public sectors 
help fill the talent gap?

 — How will geopolitical dynamics and emerging 
regulatory frameworks shape the global race  
to develop, commercialize, and control 
quantum technologies?

Future of 
robotics

The future of robotics covers 
the advancement of robotics 
capable of performing tasks 
autonomously or semi-
autonomously, adapting to 
new, real-life inputs with 
increasing degrees of autonomy 
and dexterity, including 
autonomous mobile robots 
and humanoid robots.

The trend—and why it matters
Over the past six decades, robots have become 
a familiar presence in advanced manufacturing. 
Today, more than four million industrial robots work 
in settings such as automobile plants. Interest in 
physical robotics, enabled by advances in AI, surged 
beyond industrial settings in 2024. A growing 
number of companies are developing robots with 
different form factors, from robotic arms and 
quadrupeds to humanoid machines that navigate 
and operate in physical spaces designed for humans. 
The same kinds of AI foundation models that enable 
the creation of chatbots are being trained to control 
robots to respond flexibly in novel situations. The 
combination of new form factors and more flexible 
control systems could put more multipurpose or 
even general-purpose robots to work.

Robots are increasingly being designed and 
deployed in environments beyond manufacturing, 
including airports, large-format stores, and 
restaurants. While annual industrial-robot 
installations are forecast to grow in the mid-single-
digit percentages annually for the next few years, 
with half of the new installations in China, the 
market for service robots in areas such as logistics, 
hospitality, and agriculture has been growing 
many times faster—20 to 35 percent annually. 
Although interest in “humanoid” robots is growing, 
many robots do not resemble humans at all. For 
example, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) that 
transport materials within a warehouse resemble a 
robotic household vacuum more than a person. An 
increasing number of robots are being designed 
to operate safely side by side with human workers. 
Known as cobots, short for collaborative robots, 
they expand the number of tasks and situations in 
which robots can be deployed beyond industrial 
settings, where safety walls often separate them 
from human workers.

Despite significant advancements, challenges 
persist. Untethered humanoid robots are 
constrained by power: A state-of-the-art humanoid 
robot can operate for about four hours before 
needing to be recharged, which takes roughly two 
hours. Humanoid robots also fall down—the balance 
needed to stay atop two feet is harder to achieve 
than one might expect. Handlike devices are often 
much slower than human hands when it comes to 
grasping objects, and other devices, such as suction 
cups, can be more effective for certain tasks. Other 
critical priorities to address are workforce reskilling, 
physical safety of human coworkers, and robust 
cybersecurity frameworks.1

Scoring the trend

Compared with other trends, robotics has a smaller overall footprint. 
Nonetheless, interest and innovation metrics for robotics increased by double 
digits from 2023 to 2024. Media attention to humanoid robots partly explains the 
increased interest, but real technological innovations are being incorporated into 
robots, including equipping them with AI-driven capabilities like natural-language 
programming and advanced sensing. The market for robots is also expanding, 
with adoption in emerging sectors like agriculture and healthcare, the 
development of cobots, and broader deployment in manufacturing and logistics.

Latest developments
Recent developments involving robotics  
include foundation models for robotics and 
humanoid robots:

 — An increasing number of robot developers are 
building “foundation models” to control robots 
in the physical world—the same AI solution that 
underpins progress in the virtual world. These 
models are giant, simulated neural networks 
trained on immense quantities of varied 
unstructured data to generate unstructured 
output data, for example, large language 
models (LLMs). In the context of robotics, the 

goal is for foundation models to generate robot 
behaviors rather than language. Additionally, 
the industry hopes that, like LLMs, foundation 
models for robots will be able to generalize from 
their training data and generate appropriate 
responses to a wide range of inputs, even those 
they were not explicitly trained on.

 — The volume of training data is a limiting factor 
for using foundation models to control robots. 
LLMs are trained on all the language data on 
the internet, but finding enough data to train 
robot foundation models on how to move is 
not easy. Researchers are getting creative 
by collaborating to collect bigger real-world 

71

00.070.040.050.060.020.010.03Technology Trends Outlook 2025training data sets, creating simulated worlds, 
teaching robots to watch videos, and paying 
workers to perform tasks repeatedly while 
being recorded, among other efforts. 

 — Multiple companies are developing humanoid 
robots, which have vaguely human shapes—
two arms, two legs, a body, and sometimes 
a head. The practical reason for developing 
robots with human forms is to deploy them in 
physical spaces designed for human beings; 
after all, legs are more suitable than wheels for 

climbing stairs. These robots are designed for 
flexible applications, as they can be deployed for 
multipurpose or even general-purpose use.

 — Robotics has expanded into more sectors, 
particularly into services, including cobots 
working safely alongside human workers. For 
example, robots are now working in the food 
service sector, preparing food. The healthcare 
sector has also expanded its use of robots, using 
them to deliver items in hospitals.

‘The moment for AI-driven robotics has arrived. In 
the face of labor shortages and escalating production 
costs, the technology will soon become a dimension of 
competitive differentiation and a CEO-level agenda topic. 
The market opportunity is massive—up to approximately 
$900 billion by 2040—but adoption still requires 
addressing challenges around capability development, 
operating model, IT/OT [information technology/
operational technology] infrastructure, and a playbook 
for automation at scale.’

Technology Trends Outlook 2025Adoption developments across  
the globe 
Adoption score: 2—Experimentation. Organizations 
are testing the functionality and viability of the 
technology using small-scale prototypes, typically 
without a focus on a near-term ROI. Few companies 
outside of manufacturing and e-commerce are 
scaling or have fully scaled the technology.

Although adoption varies across robotic 
technologies, several piloting initiatives are 
underway in warehouses, manufacturing, and 
general-purpose use cases.

In real life
Real-world examples involving the use of foundation 
models in robotics include the following:

high-throughput bioprinting techniques using 
spheroids have accelerated the creation of 
complex tissues with high cell viability. The 
technology, which produces tissue ten times 
faster than existing methods, is advancing the 
development of functional tissues and organs 
for transplantation and drug testing.

 — Biomaterials. Eco-friendly raw materials 
derived from vegetable oils are being 
developed for various applications, including 
cosmetics, superabsorbent polymers, and 
adhesives. Biologically derived scaffolds, 
such as collagen, are being optimized for 
regenerative-medicine applications.

 — Regulation of bioengineering. Regulatory 
frameworks are evolving to address rapid 
advancements in bioengineering. For example, 
the National Defense Authorization Act for 
fiscal year 2025 requires the US Department of 
Defense to create an annual biotechnology road 
map and assess barriers to adoption, workforce 
needs, and international collaboration. Similarly, 
the FDA’s 2025 guidance agenda includes new 
recommendations for evaluating biologics and 
therapeutic products, reflecting the growing 
need for oversight in this field. Yet there is 
uncertainty about how Europe and China 
will regulate bioengineered food and crops. 
While Europe debates easing restrictions 
on certain genomic techniques, China is 
expanding approvals for genetically modified 
crops but faces public skepticism about their 
safety, creating a complex global regulatory 
landscape.15

attitudes toward bioengineering remain mixed, 
with concerns about safety, equitable access, 
and ethical implications. Issues such as the 
“blurring of boundaries” between natural and 
artificial systems persist, particularly when it 
comes to synthetic-biology applications. During 
the COVID-19 pandemic, skepticism about these 
technologies increased, including concerns 
about bioengineered organisms’ ability to self-
replicate or persist in ecosystems.

 — Unintended consequences. Bioengineered 

Biological Weapons Convention and AI safety 
summits aim to mitigate these threats through 
international collaboration.

 — Effectiveness of technologies versus 

traditional approaches. While bioengineering 
technologies have transformative potential, 
their effectiveness compared with traditional 
methods is still under evaluation. For example, 
synthetic biology-based therapies must 
demonstrate cost-effectiveness and scalability 
to compete with established treatments—and 
meet rigorous safety standards.

systems are inherently interconnected, meaning 
small changes can have cascading effects. 
This is particularly relevant in light of the self-
replicating nature of engineered organisms and 
the potential for unintended consequences, 
including horizontal gene transfer, biodiversity 
loss, or ecological disruption when these 
organisms interact with natural ecosystems. 
Modified agricultural organisms, for example, 
may face challenges related to survival and 
propagation in the environment, with some 
failing while others persist unexpectedly.

 — Biosecurity and dual-use risks. The dual-use 
nature of biotechnology is another growing 
concern because tools designed for beneficial 
purposes can also be misused in harmful 
applications like bioterrorism. The intersection 
of AI and bioengineering amplifies these risks 
by lowering technical barriers to advanced 
bioengineering. Initiatives such as the 

Big questions about the future
Companies and leaders may want to consider 
a few questions when moving forward with 
bioengineering:

 — How will society balance the potential benefits 
of genetic-editing technologies with medical-
ethics concerns? 

 — What factors will influence public acceptance 
and adoption of genetically engineered crops 
and other bioengineered products? 

 — How will regulatory frameworks evolve to 
address safety and trust issues around 
emerging bioengineering technologies? 

 — How will geopolitical divergence in clinical 

research and regulation determine the global 
balance of power in bioengineering?

device (D2D) satellite connectivity is being rolled 
out, as illustrated by Apple’s emergency connection 
feature for iPhones.

Looking forward, the industry could face questions 
surrounding ownership and access rights to space, 
establish governance structures for safe operations, 
and coordinate efforts to manage space debris and 
traffic effectively. Additionally, the industry will likely 
have to navigate growing cyber risks and define 
the future landscape of satellite distribution across 
different orbits. 

‘Space is quickly becoming an essential platform for 
innovation, security, and economic growth. The dramatic 
reduction in launch costs, the rise of commercial 
satellite constellations, and new in-orbit capabilities 
are transforming what’s possible across industries. The 
organizations that will lead in this new era are those that 
embed space-based data and connectivity into their core 
strategies, forging partnerships and building the talent 
needed to navigate a rapidly evolving ecosystem.’

Future of 
energy and 
sustainability 
technologies

Energy and sustainability 
technologies encompass a broad 
spectrum of innovations aimed 
at transforming the global 
energy landscape toward a more 
sustainable and resilient future. 
This includes the spectrum 
of technologies transforming 
the global energy value chain, 
particularly focusing on clean 
electrons, electrification, 
and clean molecules.

The trend—and why it matters
Energy is the backbone of modern society, 
powering everything from industry and 
transportation to digital infrastructure and daily 
life, so the transformation of its production, 
storage, and distribution systems is one of the 
most consequential challenges and opportunities 
of our time. Our analysis of this trend examines 
the spectrum of technologies transforming the 
global energy value chain, particularly clean 
electrons, electrification, and clean molecules. 
While the broader trend encompasses everything 
from grid infrastructure to carbon management, 
our research primarily focuses on the innovations 
that enable the generation and use of low-carbon 
electricity and fuels. Additionally, energy and 

sustainability technologies are far from uniform, 
having substantial variation in their cost profiles, 
maturity, adoption rates, and potential for future 
cost reductions. 

The energy transformation is unfolding against a 
backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, shifting 
policies, and macroeconomic uncertainty, all of 
which shape investment decisions and technology 
deployment. Tariffs on clean-energy technologies, 
such as solar panels and electric vehicles, could 
increase costs and complicate global supply 
chains, while competition for critical minerals 
and components is intensifying among major 
economies. Policy support for transforming 
energy systems is shifting in various countries, 
and infrastructure gaps are significant. At the 
same time, the explosive growth of data centers is 
driving up electricity demand, putting additional 
pressure on grids. As a result, the energy transition 
is a question of not only decarbonization but also 
ensuring that new systems are affordable, reliable, 
and globally competitive—objectives now at the 
forefront of policy and industry strategy.

Key uncertainties are also shaping the trajectory 
of the energy transition. Beyond the “adoption 
problem,” defined as the complex set of barriers 
to scaling and commercializing new climate 
technologies, fundamental innovation challenges 
pose obstacles to developing breakthrough 
technologies that are cost-effective, reliable, and 
scalable. The need to rapidly build out critical 
infrastructure amid supply chain bottlenecks, labor 
shortages, and regulatory delays compounds these 
challenges. The availability and sustainable sourcing 
of key materials such as lithium, rare earth elements, 
and other critical minerals also pose potential 
obstacles to achieving global net-zero commitments. 
Finally, energy transitions differ regionally, with the 
“global north” working to manage rising energy 
demand and scale low-emission technologies 
while the “global south” faces the dual challenge of 
expanding energy access and decarbonizing across 
diverse, country-specific contexts.

Latest developments
Recent developments in energy and sustainability 
technologies include the following:

 — The demand for electricity has surged 

significantly. Data centers alone have become 
one of the largest drivers of rising global 
power consumption, highlighting the urgent 
need to deploy low-emission power systems 
capable of meeting this growing demand. 
However, achieving decarbonization goals 
requires addressing several critical challenges, 
including ensuring flexibility in production and 
demand to balance baseload requirements, 
managing the intermittency of renewables 

such as wind and solar, and tackling economic 
hurdles such as falling capture prices for 
renewable-energy sources. In Texas, for 
example, gas peaker plants and engines are 
springing up alongside battery energy storage 
systems to ensure energy availability during 
peak periods. Additionally, investments in 
renewable-energy sources increasingly rely on 
power purchase agreements backed by strong 
balance sheets to remain viable amid market

based contracts, and improved operational 
flexibility—electric systems risk becoming a 
bottleneck in broader decarbonization efforts.

 — Advances in measurement technologies, such 
as satellite imagery and light detection and 
ranging (LiDAR), have enhanced the ability to 
monitor and model environmental impacts with 
greater precision and lower costs. These tools 
enable more accurate emission tracking, land use 
changes, and ecosystem health, which supports 
better decision-making for climate initiatives and 
regulatory compliance. For start-ups developing 
climate technologies, these innovations provide 
critical proof points that validate environmental 
benefits, helping to secure long-term contracts 
and improve projections of technology 
performance and impact.

 — Hydrogen is increasingly viewed as an 

important option for decarbonizing hard-to-
abate sectors, with ongoing technological 
advances and policy support laying the 
groundwork for future growth. Although high 
production costs and slow project progression 
continue to present challenges, innovations in 
electrolyzer technology and integration with 
low-cost renewables are gradually improving 
the outlook. Europe remains at the forefront in 
developing the hydrogen market, and China is 
rapidly expanding its electrolyzer manufacturing 
capacity, signaling growing momentum even as 
the sector works to overcome key barriers to 
large-scale adoption. 

 — Advanced biofuels and e-fuels are gaining 

traction, though challenges remain. 

Innovations in biofuel production, such as fuel 
from agricultural waste, are improving efficiency 
and reducing costs. Uncertainties remain 
in scaling production and reducing the gap 
between the costs of biofuels and conventional 
fossil fuels, which underscores the need for 
continued investment and supportive policies to 
accelerate adoption.

 — Nuclear power is attracting attention because 

of its ability to provide stable baseload 
electricity. Several countries have initiated or 
expanded their nuclear fission programs, and 
31 countries have committed to tripling global 
nuclear energy capacity by 2050. However, the 
sector faces persistent challenges, including 
high capital expenditures, lengthy construction 
timelines, and ongoing public concerns 
about safety and nuclear waste. Advances in 
small modular reactors (SMRs) and improved 
economies of scale could help lower costs and 
accelerate deployment, but the future role of 
nuclear remains highly uncertain. Depending 
on decarbonization pathways, policy support, 
and the pace of technological progress, nuclear 
power could account for anywhere from 8 to 
43 percent of global electricity by 2040, with 
market revenues varying widely, potentially 
reaching $400 billion, though only under the 
most optimistic scenarios. In addition to proven 
fission technologies, the promise of nuclear 
fusion for power generation is attracting 
investment, but significant technical challenges 
need to be overcome to make this technology 
a reality.

Adoption developments across  
the globe 
Adoption score: 3—Piloting. Organizations 
are deploying the technology in the first few 
business use cases, via pilot projects or limited 
implementation, to test its feasibility and 
effectiveness.

But adoption rates of energy and sustainability 
technologies vary significantly, reflecting 
differences in technological maturity, economic 
viability, and enabling infrastructure. Some, such 
as solar-photovoltaic (PV) and wind power, are 
scaling rapidly in certain regions. Currently, China 
leads globally in solar PV manufacturing capacity, 
while India is scaling its production capacity and 
is expected to become the second-largest solar 
PV manufacturer by 2026. Other technologies, 
including green hydrogen and synthetic fuels, are

transport. The Swiss company Synhelion 
and others are developing e-fuel production 
processes that skip traditional steps, potentially 
reducing costs. In 2024, Synhelion inaugurated 
DAWN, the world’s first industrial-scale 
plant that produces synthetic fuels using 
solar heat, in Jülich, Germany. Synhelion’s 
process uses concentrated solar energy to 
achieve temperatures as high as 1,200°C 
in a thermochemical reactor that produces 
synthetic gas directly from CO2 and water. This 
could reduce production costs and improve 
overall efficiency. 

The following is a real-world example of advances in 
measurement technologies:

Real-world examples of advances in nuclear power 
include the following:

leveraging advanced satellite technology, 
launched the Tanager-1 satellite in 2024 
to detect, pinpoint, and track methane 
and CO2 “superemitters” worldwide with 
unprecedented precision. The coalition makes 
facility-level emissions data publicly accessible 
to empower rapid mitigation and support 
global climate goals. By combining NASA JPL’s 
cutting-edge imaging spectrometer with Planet 
Labs’ agile satellite platform, Carbon Mapper’s 
open data helps governments, industry, and the 
public identify leaks and verify reductions. 

The following is a real-world example of advances

directly from the ambient air. The captured CO₂ 
can then be stored permanently underground 
or used in various industrial processes.

 — Long-duration storage. These energy storage 
technologies can store energy for extended 
periods (ranging from several hours to days 
or even weeks), addressing the variability of 
renewable-energy sources and ensuring grid 
reliability. Examples include advanced batteries, 
pumped hydro storage, compressed air energy 
storage, and hydrogen storage.

 — Thermal energy storage. These technologies 
store energy in the form of heat or cold for  
later use. This can include storing heat from 
solar thermal collectors, industrial-waste  
heat, or excess electricity for heating or  
cooling applications.

 — Adaptation solutions. These are measures 

taken to adjust to the actual or expected effects 
of climate change. Adaptation encompasses 
a wide range of actions, from building more 
resilient infrastructure and developing drought-
resistant crops to implementing early-warning 
systems for extreme weather events and 
managing coastal retreat.

Key uncertainties
The major uncertainties affecting energy and 
sustainability technologies include the following:

 — Grid resilience and flexibility. The ability of 

power grids to handle increasing amounts of 
variable renewable energy while maintaining 
stability and reliability is a major uncertainty in 
the energy transition.

Technology Trends Outlook 2025‘Decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors requires more than 
engineering breakthroughs. It demands coordinated 
action across industries, governments, and communities 
to ensure that innovation is accessible, affordable, and 
resilient in the face of global uncertainties.’  

— Sebastian Mayer, partner, Munich

 — Infrastructure development. The scale of 

 — Macroeconomic impacts on investment. 

infrastructure upgrades required for the energy 
transition, including transmission lines, charging 
stations, and hydrogen pipelines, is vast and 
faces potential delays and funding challenges.

Inflation, rising interest rates, and global trade 
disruptions create uncertainty about financing 
costs and investment flows for large-scale 
clean-energy projects.

 — Supply chain and resource constraints. The 

availability and sustainable sourcing of critical 
materials for clean-energy technologies, such 
as rare earth elements and lithium, could limit 
the speed of deployment.

 — Market dynamics. The interplay between 
traditional and emerging energy markets, 
including the future role of fossil fuels and the 
competitiveness of renewable-energy sources, 
remains a key area of uncertainty.

 — Pace of innovation and cost reductions. 
The speed at which technologies such as 
green hydrogen electrolyzers, advanced 
batteries, and synthetic fuels improve cost and 
performance (for example, achieve cost parity 
with fossil fuel alternatives) remains uncertain, 
which affects their scalability and adoption in 
hard-to-abate sectors.

 — Systemic market and regulatory evolution. 
The ability of electricity market designs and 
regulatory frameworks to rapidly adapt and 
incentivize flexibility, resilience, and low-
emission investments is uncertain, posing risks 
to grid stability and affordability.

 — Labor and talent availability. The capacity to 
scale workforce development and training 
programs to close acute talent shortages in clean 
energy, sustainability, and digital skills essential 
for energy transition technologies is uncertain, 
risking project delays and innovation bottlenecks.

Big questions about the future
Companies and leaders may want to consider  
a few questions when pursuing energy and 
sustainability technologies:

 — What will it take to accelerate the transition 

of promising climate technologies from lab to 
market, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors 
such as steel and cement?

 — How can digital innovations—like AI, sensors, 
and advanced analytics—accelerate the 
deployment and integration of renewables  
and climate technologies across fragmented 
energy systems?

 — As global electrification surges, how will 

energy systems adapt to rising demand, more 
distributed ownership of generation and 
storage, and the need for next-generation  
grid governance?

 — How can nations and companies secure 
resilient, diversified supply chains for  
critical clean-energy materials amid rising 
geopolitical tensions?

 — What regulatory frameworks and market 

mechanisms might unlock the investment and 
coordination required to scale next-generation 
energy technologies while maintaining 
affordability and reliability?
