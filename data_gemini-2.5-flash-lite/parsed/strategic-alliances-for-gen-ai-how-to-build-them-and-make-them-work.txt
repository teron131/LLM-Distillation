Strategic alliances for gen 
AI: How to build them and 
make them work

Strategic alliances are a must for companies looking to build value from generative 
AI. But approaching them like traditional vendor arrangements won’t work.

Generative AI’s (gen AI) transformative potential 
promises to revolutionize business and propel up to 
$4.4 trillion in economic impact annually. 
Unprecedented adoption rates from companies 
across industries and sectors, as well as significant 
private investment, underscore this potential.

Capturing the value from technology, however, is 
never just about the tech alone. Companies looking 
to move beyond running gen AI experiments will 
need to rewire how they work to achieve the full 
value of their efforts. One key component of this 
rewiring is developing strategic alliances1 with gen 
AI providers. The unique challenges of working with 
gen AI—from the lack of experience that many have 
in using the technology to gen AI’s instability and 
risk to the technology’s rapid pace of change—have 
made collaborations increasingly vital.

While many companies are already working to some 
degree with gen AI providers, outdated notions of 
what to look for in a provider and how strategic 
alliances should function are putting these efforts 
at risk. To make the most of strategic alliances, 
companies should focus on three areas:

solutions will work with other components in a 
company’s gen AI ecosystem.

3. Stay in control of your destiny. It is important to

strike a balance between building on a
provider’s capabilities and becoming overly
dependent on them. That means investing in a
flexible infrastructure, monitoring provider
performance continually, and tying
compensation to outcomes while being clear
about intellectual property (IP) boundaries.

Go deeper on collaboration

As many companies are learning, the “build versus 
buy” approach to creating gen AI capabilities falls 
short when it comes to harnessing gen AI’s full 
potential. Building solutions entirely in-house can 
be time consuming and resource intensive, 
especially given the lack of gen AI talent at most 
companies.2 And while buying existing gen AI 
products or services can provide quick access to 
proven solutions, these solutions often require 
experienced gen AI workers to customize them to 
what the business really needs.

1. Go deeper on collaboration. Working with
providers on gen AI programs requires
a greater degree of trust and collaboration
than has been necessary with traditional
vendors, with thoughtful transparency,
frequent communications, and explicit
alignment across planning, development, and
ongoing management.

2. Zero in on providers who provide scalability,
interoperability, and reusability. No single
provider can offer companies everything they
need. Achieving scale with a range of providers
means understanding not only how well
providers can scale but also how well their

Collaborating with providers, on the other hand, can 
offer significant benefits in terms of access to the 
latest capabilities and expertise, development 
speed, and tailored solutions. But effective 
strategic gen AI alliances work differently from 
traditional vendor relationships. The technology is 
still rapidly maturing, implementation is complex, 
and stability issues bedevil solutions, requiring 
closer collaboration and higher degrees of trust. 
Sharing data to fine-tune models, for example, can 
happen only if client companies trust strategic allies 
to protect it effectively. Similarly, the complexity of 
addressing root cause issues in AI models, many of 
which are not yet fully stable, necessitates both 
clear lines of communication and alignment on 

1 A strategic alliance typically has broad and long-term impact on corporate performance and valuation, often formed to create a competitive 
advantage for the partners in their respective markets. Not all alliances need to be strategic; alliances can be established to achieve highly 
operational or tactical objectives and can include working with large hyperscale providers or more niche organizations. (This definition is adapted 
from the one created by the Association of Strategic Alliance Professionals. For more, see “Alliance management definitions,” Association of 
Strategic Alliance Professionals, accessed May 6, 2024.)

resolution protocols. This level of trust and 
collaboration should be established on three 
essential building blocks:

—  Cocreation of solutions. For most companies,  
the greatest value from gen AI will come from 
adopting established capabilities, which 
providers offer, and tailoring these capabilities 
to companies’ unique data. This requires a 
highly iterative and collaborative process where 
the company and provider work closely 
together to source and prepare the right data, 
engineer relevant prompts, fine-tune models 
based on specific use case needs, and test and 
iterate on the models in the field. To manage 
the range of providers a company might need to 
work with, it will be important to institute 
frequent touchpoints to share updates, discuss 
challenges, and align on priorities across 
providers. Dedicating time for in-person 
workshops and co-innovation sessions, 
celebrating milestones, and sharing learnings 
openly during this process is also critical for 
building trust.

When a luxury retail company, for instance, 
partnered with a gen AI provider to create a 
personalized product recommendation system, 
the company shared its vast catalog of product 
information, including detailed specifications, 
features, and customer reviews. The company 
also provided valuable insights into the nuances 
of customer preferences and behaviors, such as 
how they pose queries. This helped the provider 
engineer relevant prompts, fine-tune the gen AI 
models to understand and interpret this 
domain-specific data, and comprehend the 
specific language, terminology, and attributes 
used to describe luxury products.

This collaboration was instrumental in allowing  
the resulting model to surface the most 
appropriate products, even for complex or 
ambiguous queries, with over 99 percent 
accuracy. Early results indicate the solution could 
yield a 10 to 20 percent improvement in 
the conversion rate from product discovery 
to purchase, a significant leap for the 
luxury industry.

—   Joint planning. It is essential for the gen AI  

provider to offer visibility into its product road 
map, including upcoming features and 
capabilities, and possibly grant access to alpha 
or beta releases. This allows the client company 
both to anticipate how the provider’s offerings 
might evolve to meet the company’s own future 
needs and to possibly influence the direction of 
the road map. The road map can also be 
aligned when the company shares its strategic 
goals and relevant customer insights to 
help the provider better understand the 
company’s needs.

This level of communication and coordination is 
particularly important given that companies will 
likely be working with different gen AI models 
and applications—often developed by different 
providers—that need to be closely integrated 
for a solution to work well. Potential benefits of 
providing clarity and transparency include 
helping various vendors align their road maps 
and identify dependencies (for example, 
between multiple models that need to work 
together to deliver a specific gen AI solution). 
One area where we’ve seen big dividends is 
investing significant time together up 
front—often meeting every couple of days for 
two to four weeks—to work out a mutual road

map and system dependencies. The output from 
this effort should include a primary project plan 
that captures milestones and dependencies 
between providers so the client company can 
better manage and coordinate all parties.

One leading technology company adopted this 
approach. It engaged in joint planning sessions 
with its gen AI providers to identify high-impact 
use cases to strengthen its core product. The 
company shared valuable customer analytics 
insights and outlined its long-term vision for AI-
driven innovation, which helped the gen AI 
providers develop a more aligned road map. For 
their part, the gen AI providers offered early 
access to new gen AI features and models, 
allowing the company to test and provide 
feedback before general release. Through these 
collaborative-planning efforts and continual 
communication about road map needs and 
adjustments, the company was able to reduce 
time to market for deploying at-scale solutions. 
For instance, it launched a personalized 
marketing campaign powered by gen AI 
within six months of starting the strategic 
alliance, resulting in a significant boost 
in sales conversions.

—   Risk and investment sharing. Gen AI programs 
often require sizable investments in specialized 
hardware, large-scale data acquisition and 
tagging, and extensive computational resources 
for model training. In addition, the risks 
associated with adopting gen AI capabilities—
from hallucinating models to privacy issues—
require close attention. For these reasons, 
companies should consider how best to distribute 
among providers financial, technological, and 
operational resources and risks associated with 
gen AI development. Companies and providers, 
for example, should be explicit in defining 
specific risks associated with the gen AI project, 
such as data privacy breaches, model biases, or 
IP infringement. These agreements will ideally 
outline each party’s responsibilities for mitigating 
and managing these risks, as well as any 
financial or legal liabilities.

The same technology company mentioned earlier 
shared risks with their gen AI providers by 
structuring contracts around outcomes instead 
of token usage. This approach allowed the 
company to manage uncertainties and costs 
while aligning incentives and fostering a shared 
commitment to success.

Zero in on providers that offer 
scalability, interoperability, and 
reusability

A single provider that can provide all the best 
components for an effective gen AI solution doesn’t 
exist, at least not yet. The variety of components 
and models needed to work together across 
the tech stack means that companies will need 
to team up with a curated network of specialized 
tech providers.

In developing an ecosystem of providers that can 
scale, the component parts working together are 
more important than the parts individually. 
Companies need to weigh those criteria that enable 
the overall gen AI system to work most effectively. 
Selecting the right providers has become 
particularly challenging given the growth in the 
provider landscape. In fact, since the launch of 
ChatGPT in November 2022, the number of open-
source large language models (LLMs) and 
commercial LLMs has quadrupled.3 Furthermore, 
there are currently more than 1,000 AI vendors, 
with more than 600 new products introduced over 
the previous year, mostly spurred by gen AI.4 To 
that end, companies should zero in on three key 
criteria when selecting providers:

—  Scalability. Given the mind-boggling scale of 
gen AI—from the amount of data needed to 
train and fine-tune models to the number of 
queries models respond to—providers should 
have a proven track record of handling 
increased volumes of complex traffic and user 
queries without compromising performance. 
Companies should pressure test pilot programs, 
which often do not replicate live conditions and 
are typically not a good barometer for scaling 
readiness. When evaluating scalability, it is 
important to look for providers that can commit 
to specific milestones, such as handling 

a 50 percent increase in user queries over six 
months without degradation. Providers should 
also be willing to regularly review and adjust 
milestones and contracts to ensure alignment 
with evolving goals.

— Reusability. Reusing code can accelerate the 
development of gen AI use cases by 30 to 
50 percent, so it’s critical that providers offer 
solutions that can be easily repurposed across 
multiple projects.5 Companies should therefore 
look for providers that offer flexible, modular 
components and pretrained models (such as 
customizable natural-language-processing 
modules or configurable data pipelines that can 
be fine-tuned and adapted to various contexts. 
They should also seek providers that offer tools 
and frameworks (for example, intuitive APIs and 
software development kits for integrating and 
extending gen AI components or drag-and-drop 
interfaces for model fine-tuning) that can 
enable the easy customization and extension 
of solutions.

— Interoperability. Interoperability between 

models and components is crucial for creating 
a cohesive, efficient, and scalable gen AI 
ecosystem. When evaluating model or solution 
interoperability, companies should look for 
providers that adhere to industry standards and 
best practices for data exchange, API design, 
and software development (for example, 
standard data formats such as Apache Avro and 
JavaScript Object Notation, established machine 
learning frameworks like PyTorch, or data 
governance standards). Providers should use 
widely adopted programming languages, offer 
well-documented and easy-to-use APIs, and 
support smooth integration with the company’s 
data sources, applications, and platforms.

These three criteria are crucial for selecting gen AI 
providers that can scale, but companies should also 
ensure that all providers meet a high bar on other 
criteria, such as ethical guidelines and adherence to 
local privacy and tech sovereignty regulations. 
Establishing and aligning around clear data 
governance and security protocols can go a long 
way toward building trust with providers.

Stay in control of your destiny

Finding the sweet spot between forging close 
strategic alliances and maintaining agency over the 
broader direction and vision of these collaborations 
presents a critical challenge for organizations. 
Companies looking to maintain independence and 
control of their destiny would do well to consider 
the following guidelines:

—  Establish a flexible infrastructure. A flexible, 
scalable gen AI infrastructure can serve as a 
foundation for quickly integrating different 
providers. This “chassis” could be a centralized 
platform or a set of well-defined APIs, 
integration protocols, and data formats that 
enable different gen AI components to work 
together seamlessly. To ensure maximum 
flexibility, companies can adopt MLOps
(machine learning operations) best practices, 
such as containerization, automated testing, 
and continuous-integration and continuous-
delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. These practices help 
ensure the reliability and performance of the 
gen AI stack and allow for rapid rollback of 
changes if issues arise.

—  Continually monitor model performance. 
       Companies need to maintain a clear 
       understanding of what providers are building to 
       avoid receiving a “black box” solution. They 

should ensure that providers include proper 
documentation and sufficient transparency 
during development. Robust monitoring and 
testing capabilities are needed to track provider 
performance and identify issues early (for 
example, automated reporting capabilities to 
collect and aggregate relevant metrics, including 
model inputs and outputs, latency and 
throughput statistics, and user feedback). It’s 
important to regularly conduct end-to-end tests 
of the gen AI solution—from data ingestion to 
model outputs—so as to track performance and 
identify the source of a problem across the 
provider ecosystem. Experience has shown 
that involving all providers in establishing 
a comprehensive testing strategy (joint 
integration testing and scenario testing, for 
instance) helps to set clear expectations 
and responsibilities.

— Establish clear IP boundaries. Difficult 

questions about IP are still being worked 
through with respect to gen AI, so it is important 
to establish clear boundaries up front. 
Companies should specify, for example, the 
existing IP that each party brings to the 
collaboration, such as proprietary data sets, 
algorithms, or models. They should define how 
IP that is created during the collaboration (for 
example, any patents, copyrights, or trade 
secrets) will be owned and managed, including 
predefined terms for licensing, commercialization, 
and revenue sharing. And they should outline a 
process for tracking and attributing individual 
contributions to the codeveloped IP, which can 
help prevent disputes and ensure proper 
recognition of each party’s contributions. Being 
transparent and assuring alignment during this 
process can also help build trust.

— Tie compensation to outcomes. While following 

best practices on contract structure (for 
instance, including clear KPIs, service level 
agreements, and licensing arrangements) and 
specifying risk-sharing provisions, it is critical to 
tie a provider’s compensation to measurable 
outcomes such as model accuracy, uptime, and 
user satisfaction. Companies should avoid 
minimum spend requirements and include clear 
exit clauses and data portability requirements to 
avoid limiting flexibility.

Getting started

As the transformative potential of gen AI continues 
to unfold, companies should act decisively to 
position themselves for success in this new era. To 
get started, executives can consider the following 
actions:

— Establish a steering committee made up of key 
stakeholders from business, IT, legal, and 
procurement to oversee the gen-AI-alliance 
strategy. The committee should be tasked with 
defining strategic-alliance criteria, setting 
performance metrics, and establishing 
governance guidelines. To do so, the team 
needs sufficient autonomy to make decisions 
within strategic guidelines.

guidelines for assessing scalability, reusability, 
and interoperability, as well as templates for 
contracts, service-level agreements, and 
performance dashboards.

— Conduct a strategic gen-AI-alliance audit to 

assess current strategic alliances and identify 
gaps, redundancies, or misalignments with the 
gen AI strategy. Determine which strategic 
alliances to maintain, expand, or phase out 
based on their potential to spur business value.

— Assign dedicated relationship managers to the 
gen AI alliance. The managers should have a 
solid understanding of gen AI technologies, 
architectures, and best practices so they can 
effectively communicate with providers, assess 
their capabilities, and ensure alignment with the 
company’s technical requirements. They also 
oversee the entire gen AI ecosystem and act as 
the “central authority” to help coordinate 
activities among providers, monitor progress, 
and resolve issues. In many cases, it will be 
useful to have a solution architect on board, as 
well as to regularly meet with providers to 
understand exactly what they are doing and 
how they are progressing.

— Develop a strategic gen-AI-alliance playbook 
that includes a standardized framework for 
evaluating, onboarding, and managing new gen 
AI providers. This framework should include 

Building trust and fostering collaboration are just as 
important as choosing the right technology. 
Companies should start small, learn fast, and iterate 
often to ensure that they are well on their way to 
unlocking the full potential of gen AI.
