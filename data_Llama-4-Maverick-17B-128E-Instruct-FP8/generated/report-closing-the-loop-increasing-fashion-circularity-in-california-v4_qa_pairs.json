  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe report \"Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in California\" explores the potential for a closed-loop recycling system in California's fashion industry, which is currently predominantly linear and wasteful. The research, conducted by McKinsey & Company in collaboration with several fashion industry players, found that Californians are willing to adopt circular fashion practices, with 54% anticipating buying more clothes made with recycled materials. A fully closed-loop apparel recycling system in California could achieve a total holistic impact of $7-9 billion a year, with a return on investment of $2.70 for every $1.00 spent. The report highlights the potential for significant economic, environmental, and social benefits from adopting circular fashion practices.",
