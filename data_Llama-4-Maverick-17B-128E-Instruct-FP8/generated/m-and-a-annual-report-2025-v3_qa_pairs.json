  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey M&A Annual Report for 2025 explores the outlook for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the coming year, suggesting that despite challenges, the global M&A market is poised for a resurgence, particularly in North America.

Companies have strong balance sheets and cash positions, and many are looking to M&A to drive growth and adjust their portfolios to capture innovations and new capabilities. The report predicts that dealmakers who adapt their M&A strategies to the new conditions and have a clear vision and internal capabilities will thrive, while others may struggle.",
