  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe World Economic Forum and McKinsey Health Institute have collaborated on a report, \"Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change Lives,\" which highlights the importance of investing in employee health and well-being. The report argues that prioritizing employee health can generate up to $11.7 trillion in global economic value and improve productivity, reduce healthcare costs, and foster a resilient workforce. The current state of workforce health is concerning, with only 57% of employees reporting good holistic health, and certain demographics facing poorer health outcomes. The report suggests that organizations can address workforce health by adopting six evidence-based principles, including understanding employee health status, developing sustainable initiatives, and embedding health into organizational culture.",
