  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Global Banking Annual Review 2023, \"The Great Banking Transition,\" examines the significant changes in the banking industry, driven by factors such as digital innovation, new competitors, and shifting macroeconomic conditions. Despite recent challenges, the industry has experienced a favorable turnaround, with rising interest rates boosting profits and return on equity (ROE) to 12% in 2022 and an expected 13% in 2023. The report identifies five priorities for financial institutions to future-proof themselves: exploiting leading technologies, flexing the balance sheet, scaling or exiting transaction business, leveling up distribution, and adapting to the evolving risk landscape. The industry is also experiencing a geographical divergence, with banks in certain regions, such as the Indian Ocean crescent, outperforming others. The report concludes that operational excellence and strategic decision-making will be crucial for banks to succeed in a rapidly changing environment.",
