  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document discusses how organizations are restructuring to capture value from generative AI (gen AI). According to a McKinsey Global Survey, companies are redesigning workflows, elevating governance, and mitigating risks to achieve bottom-line impact from gen AI. Larger companies are leading the way, with CEOs often overseeing AI governance and organizations selectively centralizing elements of AI deployment, such as risk and compliance. The survey findings suggest that effective AI implementation requires a top-down approach, with C-suite leadership and engaged boards driving transformation and change management.",
