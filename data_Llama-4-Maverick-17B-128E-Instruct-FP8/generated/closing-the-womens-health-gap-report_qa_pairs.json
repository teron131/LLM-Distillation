  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe World Economic Forum and McKinsey Health Institute have released a report, \"Closing the Women's Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and Economies,\" highlighting the significant economic and societal benefits of addressing the disparities in women's health. The report estimates that closing the women's health gap could boost the global economy by at least $1 trillion annually by 2040 and improve the lives of 3.9 billion women. The gap is attributed to four primary areas: science, data, care delivery, and investment, which result in women spending 25% more of their lives in poor health. To address this, the report calls for investments in women-centric research, sex- and gender-specific data collection, and enhanced care delivery, among other actions. By closing the women's health gap, women can live healthier, higher-quality lives, and contribute more to the economy.",
