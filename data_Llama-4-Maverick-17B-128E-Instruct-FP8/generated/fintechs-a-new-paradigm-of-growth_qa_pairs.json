  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe fintech industry has entered a new era of value creation, shifting from hypergrowth to sustainable and profitable growth. After a decade of rapid expansion, the industry faced a market correction in 2022, resulting in decreased funding and deal activity.
