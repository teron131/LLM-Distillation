  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe report \"Net-zero Spain: Europe's decarbonization hub\" argues that Spain can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 through a society-wide effort that leverages the country's natural resources and new technologies. To reach this goal, Spain needs to accelerate its decarbonization efforts, reducing emissions by 46% by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2045. The net-zero scenario requires significant investment, with \u20ac2.5 trillion in capital expenditures needed by 2050, and will drive innovation in areas such as electrification, green hydrogen, and biofuels. Key sectors to focus on include transport and industry, which account for over 55% of Spain's emissions. Collaboration across Spanish society is necessary to achieve this ambitious goal.",
