  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe report \"From margins to mainstream: Asians and Pacific Islanders in media\" examines the representation of Asian and Pacific Islander (API) individuals in the US film and television industry. Despite recent successes, such as \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" and \"Parasite\", the industry still has a long way to go in terms of authentic API representation, with over two-thirds of API consumers dissatisfied with current portrayals. The report finds that increasing API representation could unlock $2-4 billion in additional annual spending, rising to $4-8 billion by 2060, as API consumers currently spend 35% less on media than non-API consumers. The industry is missing an opportunity to tap into the growing API market, with API consumers earning 30% more than White consumers on average.",
