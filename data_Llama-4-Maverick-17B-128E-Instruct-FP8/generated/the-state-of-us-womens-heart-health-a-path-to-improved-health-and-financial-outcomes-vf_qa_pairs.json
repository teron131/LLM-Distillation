  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for women in the US, with over 60 million women living with the condition. Closing the CVD gap between men and women could lead to 1.6 million years of higher-quality life and boost the US economy by $28 billion annually by 2040. Women's heart health is influenced by biological factors, such as estrogen, which has a protective effect on the heart, and addressing these differences is crucial to improving care. The CVD gap is also linked to inequities in care delivery, efficacy, and data availability, highlighting the need for sex- and gender-appropriate cardiac care and research.",
