  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe report \"Superagency in the Workplace\" explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform businesses and unlock new levels of creativity and productivity. Despite significant investments in AI, only 1% of companies believe they have achieved maturity in AI adoption, with the main barrier being leadership rather than employee readiness. The research finds that employees are more prepared for AI than their leaders think, with many already using AI tools and expecting significant changes to their workflows. To harness AI's full potential, leaders must be bold and responsible in their decision-making, balancing speed and safety, and empowering employees to drive transformative change.",
