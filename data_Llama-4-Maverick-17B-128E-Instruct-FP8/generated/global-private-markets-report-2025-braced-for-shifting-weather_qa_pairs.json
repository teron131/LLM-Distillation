  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Private Markets Report 2025 analyzes the state of private markets in 2024, finding mixed conditions with tepid dealmaking and declining fundraising, but strong investor interest and confidence. Despite geopolitical instability and changing trade policies, private market stakeholders showed resilience, with fundraisers exploring new capital-raising vehicles and dealmakers focusing on operational transformation. The report highlights the rebound in private equity dealmaking and distributions, driven by a more benign financing environment, and notes that investors plan to increase their private equity allocations. The report also explores pressing issues across asset classes, including the exit backlog in private equity and the rise of alternative sources of capital. Overall, the report suggests that private markets are adapting to a new environment with higher interest rates and evolving investor needs.",
