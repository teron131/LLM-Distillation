  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute report \"Dependency and depopulation?\" explores the consequences of falling fertility rates and aging populations on economies and societies. Two-thirds of the global population lives in countries with fertility rates below the replacement rate, leading to potential population decline and changes in age structures. The report warns that current economic systems and social contracts are unsustainable and that a combination of higher productivity, more work, effective migration, and higher fertility rates is needed to ensure global prosperity. The demographic shift is expected to impact economic growth, labor markets, consumption, and public finances, with advanced economies and China being the first to feel the effects.",
