  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute report \"The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring\" explores the challenges and opportunities of transitioning to a net-zero economy by 2050. The report highlights that achieving net zero will require a fundamental transformation of the global economy, involving significant changes to seven energy and land-use systems that produce the world's emissions. The transition will require fulfilling nine key requirements, including physical building blocks, economic and societal adjustments, and governance, institutions, and commitment. The report aims to provide insights into the costs and benefits of the net-zero transition, as well as the complex questions and challenges that need to be addressed.",
