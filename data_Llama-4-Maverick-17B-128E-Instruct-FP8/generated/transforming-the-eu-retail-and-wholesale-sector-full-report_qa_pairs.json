  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe European Union's retail and wholesale sector is undergoing a significant transformation driven by megatrends such as e-commerce growth, decarbonization, and an aging population. To remain competitive, retailers and wholesalers must invest in three key areas: sustainability, digitalization, and skills and talent. The sector is expected to invest an additional 0.8-1.6% of its revenue by 2030, totaling \u20ac315-600 billion, to achieve this transformation. European retailers and wholesalers currently invest less than their global counterparts, and failing to close this investment gap could make them less competitive in the digital age.",
