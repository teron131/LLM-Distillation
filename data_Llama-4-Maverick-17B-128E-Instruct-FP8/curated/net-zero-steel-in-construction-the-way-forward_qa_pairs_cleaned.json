  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe construction industry is a significant contributor to global emissions, with steel production being a major source of carbon emissions due to its energy-intensive production process. To achieve a net-zero emissions future, the industry must transition to near-zero-emissions steel, which can be achieved through technologies such as hydrogen-reduced direct reduced iron (DRI) and electric-arc furnaces (EAFs) powered by renewable energy. The report presents a marginal-abatement cost curve for an eight-story commercial office building, showing that embodied carbon can be reduced by 70% using alternative technologies and materials. To drive the green-steel agenda, the public and private sectors must take five key actions: agree on common standards, encourage participation, unlock end-user demand, tilt capital formation, and promote learning and knowledge dissemination.",
