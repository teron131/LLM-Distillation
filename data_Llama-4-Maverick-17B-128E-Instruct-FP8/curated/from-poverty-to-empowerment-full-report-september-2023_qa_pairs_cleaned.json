  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute report \"From Poverty to Empowerment\" examines the interconnected issues of economic growth, inclusion, and sustainability, with a focus on raising minimum living standards and limiting global warming. The report introduces the concept of an \"empowerment line\" ($12 per day in purchasing power parity terms) as a benchmark for measuring progress beyond poverty reduction. Achieving economic empowerment and net-zero emissions by 2030 will require significant investment, estimated at 8% of global GDP annually, with businesses and the market economy able to generate half of the necessary resources through growth and innovation. However, substantial gaps will remain, requiring additional societal commitments and posing risks, such as distorting the baseline economy and straining the global financial system. The report frames the choices countries face in a \"decisive decade\" that will determine the state of the world in 2050.",
