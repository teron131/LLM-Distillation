  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe World Economic Forum and McKinsey Health Institute have collaborated on a report, \"Blueprint to Close the Women's Health Gap,\" which aims to improve women's health and economies worldwide. The report identifies nine conditions that drive a third of the women's health gap, including ischaemic heart disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis, and estimates that closing the gap for these conditions alone could add $400 billion to annual global GDP by 2040. The report proposes a framework to close the women's health gap, which includes counting women, studying women, caring for women, including all women, and investing in women. By addressing the drivers of the gap, such as treatment efficacy, care delivery, data, and funding, the report aims to extend women's healthy lives and capture economic benefits. The report provides a blueprint for stakeholders to work together to improve women's health and economies.",
