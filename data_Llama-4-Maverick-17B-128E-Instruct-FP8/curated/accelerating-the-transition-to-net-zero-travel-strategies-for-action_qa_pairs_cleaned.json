  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe travel industry, which accounts for 8-11% of global emissions, is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint as climate change worsens. To achieve net-zero emissions, travel companies can take practical steps now, such as identifying and sequencing decarbonization initiatives, partnering with corporate clients to accelerate decarbonization of business travel, and closing the \"say-do\" gap among leisure travelers. The report by McKinsey & Company and Skift Research outlines four high-priority areas for travel companies to focus their decarbonization efforts, including developing sustainable travel businesses for the future. By taking these steps, travel companies can potentially create value while reducing their environmental impact.",
