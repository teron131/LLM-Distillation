  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe Global Materials Perspective 2024 report, produced by McKinsey's Global Energy & Materials Practice, explores the demand and supply of materials critical to the energy transition. The report analyzes three energy transition scenarios and two supply scenarios, using data from McKinsey's Metal&MineSpans database, which covers over 11,000 assets across 130 countries. The report categorizes materials into three demand trends driven by the energy transition: those with stable demand, those with increasing demand (e.g., copper, lithium, and rare earth elements), and those with decreasing demand (e.g., thermal coal). The supply scenarios are based on the maturity and likelihood of individual projects in the metals and mining industry. The report aims to provide insights into the changing availability, affordability, and sustainability of materials critical to the energy transition.",
