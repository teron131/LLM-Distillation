  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe report \"Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks\" assesses the impact of nature-related risks and opportunities on financial institutions in Africa. The study applies a quantitative risk assessment and stress-testing framework to evaluate the potential changes in asset values and company-level financial performance due to nature-related factors. The report highlights the materiality of nature-related risks and opportunities in Africa, where over 60% of the population depends on ecosystem services for their livelihoods. The study estimates the potential changes in expected losses from lending and equity prices for several leading African commercial financial institutions and six African countries.",
