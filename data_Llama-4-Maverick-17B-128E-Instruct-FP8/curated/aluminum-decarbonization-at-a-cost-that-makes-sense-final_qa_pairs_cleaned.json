  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe aluminum industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 2% of global emissions. To achieve a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, the industry must decarbonize by upgrading refining and smelting assets and investing in low-carbon power. The report identifies various levers to accelerate decarbonization, including financial, policy, and demand levers, and presents five scenarios for retrofitting existing facilities. Collaborative action among stakeholders, including banks, investors, policy makers, and end customers, is necessary to overcome economic obstacles and risks, with an estimated $1 trillion in cumulative investment needed to deliver a net-zero sector.",
