  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document discusses the challenges retailers face in reducing their Scope 3 emissions, which are indirect greenhouse gas emissions generated within their value chains. Retailers' Scope 3 emissions are complex and multifaceted, spanning various industries and energy systems, and accounting for approximately 98% of the retail sector's total emissions. To decarbonize their value chains, retailers must engage with multiple stakeholders, including suppliers, distributors, and consumers, and implement targeted actions across seven strategic decarbonization themes. The report suggests that reducing Scope 3 emissions by 15% is feasible by 2030 using existing technologies, with potential for further reductions through innovation. Retailers can play various roles in decarbonization efforts, from leading and scaling to advocating and supporting actions across their value chains.",
