  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute's research examines the lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on real estate in \"superstar\" cities worldwide. The pandemic has led to a shift towards hybrid work, resulting in a decline in office attendance and a ripple effect on urban cores, with decreased population, increased vacancy rates, and reduced foot traffic near stores. The research models future demand for office, residential, and retail space, predicting a decline in demand for office and retail space in superstar cities, with varying effects by neighborhood and city. Cities can adapt by developing mixed-use neighborhoods, constructing adaptable buildings, and designing multiuse office and retail space. The research suggests that demand for office space could be 13% lower by 2030 in a moderate scenario.",
