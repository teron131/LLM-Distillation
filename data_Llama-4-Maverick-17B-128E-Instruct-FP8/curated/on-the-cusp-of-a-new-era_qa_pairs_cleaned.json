  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute's discussion paper \"On the cusp of a new era?\" explores the possibility that the world is entering a new era, driven by significant global events and shifts in the economic and geopolitical landscape. The authors draw parallels between the current era and past \"earthquakes\" such as the post-WWII boom, the oil crisis, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, which ushered in new eras. They examine five domains - world order, technology platforms, demographic forces, resource and energy systems, and capitalization - to understand the potential shape of the next era. The authors argue that the current era is distinct from previous ones due to its global interconnectedness, financial leverage, and carbon constraints. The paper aims to help leaders navigate the uncertainty and potential opportunities of this new era.",
