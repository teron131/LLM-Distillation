  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences:\n\nThe document \"The Missing Billion\" highlights the significant gap in healthcare equity for people with disabilities, who make up 16% of the global population. The lack of health data on people with disabilities hinders efforts to improve their health outcomes, which are currently worse than those of the general population. To address this issue, the McKinsey Health Institute and the Missing Billion Initiative are working together to improve data collection and usage, and to identify actions that stakeholders can take to close the health data equity gap. The report emphasizes that good data is essential to raising awareness of disparities, identifying barriers to healthcare access, and determining effective interventions to improve health outcomes for people with disabilities.",
