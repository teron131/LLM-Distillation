  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Quantum Technology Monitor report highlights the steady progress in quantum technology (QT), which is expected to create trillions of dollars in value within the next decade. Despite a 27% decrease in private investment in QT start-ups in 2023, public investment surged by over 50%, with countries like Germany, the UK, and South Korea announcing significant new funding. The majority of investments went to established start-ups, with a focus on scaling up quantum computing technologies. The report also notes a growth in quantum talent, with universities offering more QT-related programs, and emphasizes the need for broad collaborations to build strong capabilities in the field.",
