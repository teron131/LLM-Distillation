  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute report examines the future of work in America, particularly the impact of generative AI on the labor market. The report finds that the US labor market has undergone significant changes since the pandemic, with 8.6 million occupational shifts occurring between 2019-2022. By 2030, up to 30% of hours currently worked could be automated, with office support, customer service, and food service employment likely to decline. The report predicts 12 million additional occupational transitions by 2030, with workers in lower-wage jobs being more likely to need to change occupations and acquire new skills. The report emphasizes the need for workforce development on a larger scale and more expansive hiring approaches from employers.",
