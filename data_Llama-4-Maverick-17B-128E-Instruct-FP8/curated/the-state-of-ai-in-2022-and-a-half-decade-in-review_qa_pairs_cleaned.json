  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Survey on AI provides an overview of the state of AI adoption and its impact on businesses over the past five years. AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017, with 50% of respondents reporting AI use in at least one business area, although the proportion of organizations using AI has plateaued between 50-60% in recent years. The survey highlights that companies with the highest financial returns from AI continue to invest more in the technology, adopt advanced practices, and attract top talent. The most common AI use cases include service operations optimization, customer service analytics, and product development, with significant revenue and cost benefits reported in areas such as marketing and sales, product development, and supply chain management.",
