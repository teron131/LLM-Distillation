Create incentives for businesses and consumers to adopt digital currency. 6. Build trust from the beginning by delivering on promises; better to succeed at something simple than half-deliver on something complex. 7. Seek partnerships to accelerate scale-up while maintaining a central relationship with key customers. 8. Leverage existing payment infrastructure to accelerate time to market."
