  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute has identified 18 potential \"arenas of competition\" that could reshape the global economy and generate $29 trillion to $48 trillion in revenues by 2040. Arenas are industries characterized by high growth and dynamism, capturing an outsize share of the economy's growth and experiencing significant changes in market share. The report analyzes 12 arenas that emerged between 2005 and 2020, such as e-commerce and cloud services, and identifies the key factors that contribute to the formation of an arena, including business model or technological step changes, escalatory investments, and a large addressable market. The 18 potential future arenas include AI software and services, cybersecurity, and future air mobility, among others.",
