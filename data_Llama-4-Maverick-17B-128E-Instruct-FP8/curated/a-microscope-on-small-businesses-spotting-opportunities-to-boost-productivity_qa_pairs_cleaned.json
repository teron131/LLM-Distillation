  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute has conducted research on micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) to identify opportunities to boost their productivity. MSMEs are the backbone of economies, accounting for two-thirds of business employment in advanced economies and almost four-fifths in emerging economies. However, their labor productivity is half that of larger companies, and closing this gap could yield significant value, equivalent to 5-10% of GDP. The research uses a granular data set across 16 countries and various sectors to analyze MSME productivity and identify potential areas for improvement.",
