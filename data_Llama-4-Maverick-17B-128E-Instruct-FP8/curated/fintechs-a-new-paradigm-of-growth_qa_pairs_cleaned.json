  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe fintech industry has entered a new era of value creation, shifting from hypergrowth to sustainable and profitable growth. After a decade of rapid expansion, the industry faced a market correction in 2022, resulting in decreased funding and deal activity. Despite this, fintechs are expected to grow almost three times faster than traditional banking between 2022 and 2028, driven by digital adoption, e-commerce growth, and the transformation of the banking industry. The report identifies three key themes shaping the future of fintechs: the radical transformation of banking, opportunities for growth in an expanding financial-services ecosystem, and varying resilience among fintechs in different verticals and growth stages.",
