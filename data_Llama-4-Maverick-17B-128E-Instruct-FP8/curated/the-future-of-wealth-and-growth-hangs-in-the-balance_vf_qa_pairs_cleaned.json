  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute report \"The future of wealth and growth hangs in the balance\" examines the global balance sheet and its implications for economic growth. Over the past two decades, the global balance sheet has expanded rapidly, driven by asset price inflation, resulting in $160 trillion in \"paper wealth.\" However, economic growth has been sluggish, and inequality has risen. The report models four possible economic scenarios to 2030, including a productivity acceleration, balance sheet reset, higher for longer, and return to past era, highlighting the need for decision-makers to prepare for a range of outcomes.",
