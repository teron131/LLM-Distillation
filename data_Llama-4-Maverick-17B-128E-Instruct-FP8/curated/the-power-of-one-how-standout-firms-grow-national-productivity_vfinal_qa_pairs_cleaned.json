  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute's research, \"The Power of One,\" examines the drivers of national productivity growth, finding that a small number of standout firms contribute significantly to productivity growth. Analyzing 8,300 large firms across three countries, the study reveals that fewer than 100 \"Standouts\" account for two-thirds of productivity growth, with many others also making positive contributions. Productivity growth occurs in bursts as firms innovate and scale new value, rather than through gradual efficiency gains. The research suggests a new playbook for productivity growth, focusing on the power of leading firms and reallocation of resources to drive growth.",
