  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe US higher education system is facing multiple challenges, including slowing enrollment growth, high student debt, and declining public confidence. Despite these challenges, higher education remains a powerful enabler of economic mobility and individual empowerment. The sector has the potential to graduate 10 million more students over the next 20 years, which could lift 2.2 million Americans out of poverty, increase lifetime GDP by $16 trillion, and close the racial attainment gap by 31%. To achieve this goal, institutions must increase affordability, expand access, and provide better student support to ensure completion and post-graduation success.",
