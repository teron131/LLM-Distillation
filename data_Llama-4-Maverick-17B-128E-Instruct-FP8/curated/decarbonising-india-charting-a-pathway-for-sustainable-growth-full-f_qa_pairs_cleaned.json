  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe report \"Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth\" analyzes India's pathway to achieving its net-zero target by 2070, with a focus on six key sectors: power, automotive, aviation, steel, cement, and agriculture. The report identifies over 100 emission-reduction initiatives across two scenarios: the \"Line of Sight\" scenario, which assumes current policies and technology adoption, and the \"Accelerated\" scenario, which assumes more aggressive policies and technology adoption. The report also examines four cross-cutting enablers: green hydrogen, material circularity, natural climate solutions, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage. The authors conclude that India can meet its growth ambitions while decarbonizing, but will require significant investments and a coordinated effort across sectors. The report provides a factual basis for comparing emission-reduction approaches and launching emission-reduction projects.",
