  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe document discusses the importance of decarbonizing the built environment, which accounts for approximately 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions. McKinsey Sustainability analyzed over 1,000 solutions to reduce emissions and identified 22 effective levers that can potentially reduce emissions by up to 75% if implemented at scale. The report highlights that many of these solutions are already cost-effective and can generate significant value for companies in the built-environment ecosystem. The document also identifies 17 business opportunities that can arise from decarbonization efforts, and emphasizes the need for industry players to collaborate and invest in decarbonization solutions to achieve a net-zero world.",
