  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute's report \"Global balance sheet 2022: Enter volatility\" examines the global economy's wealth and health by analyzing the assets and liabilities of households, corporations, governments, and financial institutions. The global balance sheet grew rapidly from 2000 to 2021, with net worth reaching $610 trillion, driven largely by asset price inflation and low interest rates. However, in 2022, the balance sheet showed signs of volatility and shrunk for the first time in decades, marking a potential inflection point. The report highlights that the growth in the global balance sheet was fueled by real estate, debt, and equities, with significant variations across countries.",
