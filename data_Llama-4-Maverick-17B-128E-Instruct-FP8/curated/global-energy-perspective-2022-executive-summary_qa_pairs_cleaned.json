  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe McKinsey Global Energy Perspective 2022 report provides a detailed demand outlook across 55 sectors, 70+ energy products, and 146 countries for five key scenarios. The report explores the global energy landscape amidst unprecedented uncertainty, including the conflict in Ukraine and the ongoing shift to low-carbon energy systems. The report presents five energy scenarios, ranging from strong decarbonization to fading momentum for a transition, to help leaders navigate the transitions in energy systems. The scenarios are based on contributions from hundreds of McKinsey expert practitioners and cover a spectrum of possible outcomes. The report aims to provide insights into the longer-term trends in energy systems, including the increased competitiveness of electrification and renewables.",
