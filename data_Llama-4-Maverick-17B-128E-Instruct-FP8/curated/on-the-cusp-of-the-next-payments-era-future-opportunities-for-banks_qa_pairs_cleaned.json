  "summary": "Here is a summary of the document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts:\n\nThe 2023 McKinsey Global Payments Report analyzes the current state of the payments industry and identifies emerging opportunities for banks. The report finds that global payments revenue grew by 11% in 2022, reaching an all-time high of $2.2 trillion, driven by broad-based gains across geographies and products. The industry is on the cusp of a new era, dubbed the \"Decoupled Era\", which presents opportunities for banks to differentiate and capitalize on new dynamics. Key trends include the rise of instant payments and digital wallets, declining cash usage, and growing cross-border payment flows. The report suggests that banks can solidify their competitive position by scaling business impact and improving productivity and risk management.",
