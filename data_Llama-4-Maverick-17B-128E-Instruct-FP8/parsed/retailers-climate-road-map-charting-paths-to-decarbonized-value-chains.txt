Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsExecutive summary

As companies in all sectors work to shrink their carbon  
footprints and hit their decarbonization targets, the 
path to reducing Scope 3 emissions is often anything 
but straightforward. For some, decarbonizing Scope 
3 emissions can be more like navigating a particularly 
byzantine maze. Such is the case for retailers. 

numerous, disparate, and sometimes highly 
fragmented value chains with multiple tiers of 
suppliers and inputs. And the emissions generated 
within this labyrinth of value chains span six energy and 
land-use systems: agriculture and forestry, building, 
industry, mobility, power, and waste (Exhibit E1).

For the average retailer, Scope 3 metrics capture 
emissions generated upstream and downstream 
within the value chains of every SKU it sells—

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chains2 emissions, companies do not directly control these 
emissions. Consequently, reducing Scope 3 emissions 
depends on the engagement and efforts of all value chain 
actors, including suppliers, distributors, and consumers, 
as well as other public and private sector actors—a 
retailer cannot realize these reductions in isolation.

The breadth and complexity of their Scope 3 emissions 
have far-reaching implications for retailers in areas 
including economic, strategic, brand and reputation, 
and regulatory compliance. This is why retailers 
worldwide have embraced the opportunities in 
these challenges, pursuing ambitious sustainability 
goals and wide-ranging initiatives that have led 
to meaningful reductions in product value chain 
emissions. Their efforts include engaging suppliers 
to improve energy efficiency in manufacturing and 
transportation, reduce waste, and transition to 
renewable energy sources.

Some decarbonization efforts, such as converting 
power grids to renewable or clean energy in 
geographies where suppliers are concentrated, are 
longer-term efforts that depend greatly on the actions 
and decisions of multiple public and private sector 
players. However, many decarbonization solutions are 
within reach of retail value chain stakeholders—and 
are either cost-neutral or cost-saving to implement. 

Framed within seven strategic decarbonization action 
themes, this report illustrates how retailers and other 
value chain stakeholders could strategically deploy 
economic resources, natural and physical resources, 
human resources, low-carbon technology, and 
data transparency to realize emissions reductions. 
Because the scale, complexity, and key players for 

these efforts vary, so does the retailer’s role in the 
efforts, ranging from leading and scaling, to convening 
value chain partners, to collaborating and catalyzing, 
to advocating and supporting actions for reducing 
emissions across retail value chains.

Reducing the average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions 
by 15 percent at a system level is feasible by 2030 
using existing technologies; however, innovations in 
technologies and practices could enable an additional 
40 or 50 percent reduction.

Retailers’ Scope 3: A complex 
array of value-chain emissions
Retailers’ reporting requirements are specified in 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Corporate Value 
Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard 
and ISO 14064, the international standard series for 
quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas emissions 
and removals. Under these standards, a retailer’s 
Scope 3 emissions metric captures all GHG generated 
from sourcing, making, transporting, housing, selling, 
and using every product the retailer carries throughout 
its life cycle.

This means that for a multicategory retailer, reducing 
Scope 3 emissions—which include sources that make 
up around 98 percent of total emissions in retail—
involves players from multiple sectors and industries 
and entails efforts to decarbonize six energy and 
land-use systems. And about 80 percent of a retailer’s 
Scope 3 emissions are generated upstream in product 
value chains via feedstock production, materials and 
components, processing and manufacturing, and 
packaging (Exhibit E2).

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsRetailer challenges in focus: Delineating 
Scope 3 emissions in three value chains

Each of the millions of product value chains whose 
emissions are captured in a retailer’s Scope 3 contains 
multiple tiers of suppliers and inputs from regions 
around the globe. The commodities involved are often 
mixed together in agricultural areas or at shipping 
ports, and each tier within a value chain can be highly 
fragmented. Additionally, suppliers can change their 
sources for inputs within the course of a single year. 
This complexity makes it challenging for retailers to 
influence how suppliers handle or report on emissions.

Consumers’ use of products—powering electronics 
or washing and drying clothing, for example—is also 
captured in the Scope 3 emissions for retailers that 

carry such products. Thus, reducing downstream 
product value chain emissions often depends on 
influencing changes in consumer behavior or the 
energy sources powering the local electricity supply. 

Among retailers’ top 15 most commonly sold products, 
beef is one of the largest sources of Scope 3 emissions 
for retailers. Around 86 percent of beef value chain 
emissions are generated upstream by animal feed 
farming and production, fertilizer production, and cattle 
ranching, according to McKinsey analysis. Reducing 
ruminant methane emissions and shifting toward more  
efficient use of agricultural inputs, maximizing productivity,  
and adopting regenerative agriculture practices such as 
no- or low-till soil and cover cropping are key to realizing 
reductions in this value chain (Exhibit E3).

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsIn electronics product value chains, decarbonizing 
power use is retailers’ primary challenge. The majority 
(80 to 90 percent) of the average retailer’s Scope 3 
emissions for electronics products are generated 

upstream via suppliers in highly fragmented markets. 
Decarbonization in this stage of the value chain largely 
depends on the availability of renewable energy where 
suppliers operate (Exhibit E4).

More than 80 percent of emissions in the electronic equipment value chain are generated

Out of a retailer’s 88% Scope 3 upstream emissions: 
PCBA (printed circuit board assembly) = 80%, other 
materials (eg, steel, battery, glass, magnesium, 
aluminum, plastic, etc) = 8%

The key emission hotspot in tablet upstream 
emissions is the PCBA at ~90% because of 
energy-intensive and fossil-dependent production 
of semiconductors in Asia

62 percent of emissions are generated upstream via 
energy use among tier-two and tier-three suppliers 
engaged in garment processing and fiber production 
(Exhibit E5).

Thus, substantial reductions in retailers’ Scope 3

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsNear-term opportunities for retailers: 
Reducing emissions across value chains 
This report identifies seven decarbonization action 
themes for reducing the average retailer’s Scope 
3 emissions; the themes are based on analysis of 
technically feasible change levers in several product 
value chains. The highest reduction potential 
comes from transitioning to clean and renewable 
energy, reducing livestock emissions, and adopting 
regenerative agriculture practices. Examples 

are provided to illustrate emissions reduction 
opportunities (Exhibit E6).

As noted previously, if all were deployed at scale, these 
actions could propel a 55 to 65 percent reduction in 
the average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by 2030, 
although some actions carry sizable costs. Actions 
that reduce or do not increase costs in the system 
could yield a 12 to 17 percent reduction in the average 
retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by 2030.

 The highest reduction 
potential comes from 
transitioning to clean  
and renewable energy, 
reducing livestock emissions,  
and adopting regenerative  
agriculture practices.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsCatalyzing broader decarbonization: 
Strategies and considerations for retailers 
To help retailers prioritize decarbonization efforts, 
this report arranges levers that could be deployed 
by retailers and other stakeholders into four groups 
(labeled A, B, C, and D), each of which could enable 
strategic decarbonization actions. The report also 
illustrates these actions with examples of real-world 

initiatives involving retailers and their value chain 
partners. By focusing on the levers in groups A and B, 
the average retailer could accelerate efforts to achieve 
up to a 17 percent reduction in its Scope 3 emissions 
by 2030. However, deploying levers in groups C 
and D could unlock an additional 40 to 50 percent, 
highlighting the importance of multistakeholder 
collaboration to realize substantial impact (Exhibit E7).

To help retailers prioritize 
decarbonization efforts, 
this report arranges levers 
that could be deployed 
by retailers and other 
stakeholders into four 
groups, each of which 
could enable strategic 
decarbonization actions.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsGroup A: Cost-effective near-tier levers
Retailers could influence group A levers by engaging 
their direct suppliers, their direct suppliers’ suppliers, 
and consumers in efforts to scale decarbonization 
solutions that would result in cost savings or have no 
impact on cost (cost neutral). If deployed at scale, 
levers in this group could help reduce the average 
retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by up to 2 percent.

Examples of group A levers include forming 
partnerships that facilitate renewable-energy 
adoption; providing electric vehicle–charging 
infrastructure; supporting suppliers in implementing 
their net-zero objectives; and using consumer-focused 
marketing and tools to promote sustainable energy 
consumption habits and reduce waste.

Group B: Cost-effective far-tier levers
Retailers could influence actions in group B by 
engaging suppliers in tier-three levers and beyond 
(along with other industry partners) in efforts to deploy 
cost-saving or cost-neutral levers to facilitate adoption 
of sustainability levers. Deployed at scale, such efforts 
could potentially help reduce the average retailer’s 
Scope 3 emissions by around 11 to 15 percent.

Examples of group B levers include providing training, 
education, and resource initiatives in regenerative 
agriculture practices and emissions reduction for 
farmers; sharing and collaborating with peer companies 
and other value chain stakeholders on best practices 
to reduce waste and maximize process efficiency; 
setting supplier standards under deforestation-free 
and conversion-free (DCF) policies; promoting lean-
manufacturing adoption among in-network suppliers 
via supplier contracts; scaling decarbonization 
technologies with public and private sector support; and 
mobilizing value chains to reduce waste via systemwide 
collaborations.

Group C: Costlier near-tier levers
By engaging their tier-one, tier-two, and tier-three 
suppliers and other value chain partners, retailers could 
help spark innovation that could improve the feasibility 
of interventions that are technically achievable but 
not cost neutral (but whose costs still fall below the 
predicted global average carbon price in 2030).  

Retailer levers in group C center on collaboration with 
value chain partners to potentially help reduce the 
average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by around 19 to 
23 percent.

Examples of group C efforts include collaborating with 
value chain partners, not-for-profit organizations, and 
research institutions to support research in advancing 
sustainability measures; fostering private sector–
led investment in emissions reduction innovations; 
advocating for public sector–led incentive programs 
aimed at helping value chain partners address costs 
or resource issues; encouraging and accelerating 
renewable adoption via supplier engagement; taking 
part in campaigns to stimulate consumer awareness of, 
and encourage greater consumption of, plant-based 
protein; and helping signal demand for alternative 
protein by engaging suppliers in long-term contracts 
for plant-based ingredients.

Group D: Cost-prohibitive far-tier levers
Group D levers are far removed from retailers 
and extremely costly to implement using today’s 
technology, but retailers can nevertheless support, 
advocate, mobilize, and engage suppliers beyond 
tier three and other stakeholders to facilitate 
breakthrough innovation and solutions to realize 
systemwide changes. Group D levers deployed at 
scale could yield a 25 to 30 percent reduction in the 
average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions.

Group D examples include launching public and private 
sector–led initiatives to encourage investment in and 
adoption of renewable technology and clean- and 
renewable-energy grids; collaborating with value chain 
partners and other private and public sector actors 
to invest in and expand circularity of materials by, for 
example, facilitating consumer access to recycling 
via collection centers and encouraging recycling via 
incentives; supporting recycling technology R&D; 
supporting rare earth recycling and sustainable 
sourcing; advocating for public sector–led incentives 
to promote regenerative agricultural practices; and 
encouraging start-up and technology company-
led innovations to support precision agriculture for 
croplands through pilots and specifications.

Considerations for retailers: Measurement,  
accounting, and reporting
The complexity and scale of emissions captured in 
retailers’ Scope 3 present practical challenges in 
precisely measuring, accounting, and reporting on 
emissions reduction progress.

Measurement challenges include variability 
in emissions resulting from changes made in 
production locations and methods, raw material 

12

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chains 
use and sourcing, energy use, equipment use, and 
modes of transportation; inconsistent data formats, 
measurement standards, and infrastructure for 
data storage and processing; and barriers that 
prevent retailers from connecting data to batches of 
commodities or products as they pass from one stage 
of the value chain to the next.

Accounting challenges for retailers can stem from a 
disconnect between industry averages and actual 
decarbonization project impacts in retailers’ product 
supply chains or items, changes in historical estimates 
that require companies to revise and restate baseline 
data and create uncertainty around target setting 
and management, changes in and uncertainty around 
GHG accounting methodology, and emissions factor 
updates that lag behind changes in energy grids and 
agricultural systems.

Such measurement and accounting challenges can 
complicate reporting. For many retailers, determining 
their Scope 3 inventory can seem like a modeling 
exercise based on broad industry averages and 
historical emissions factors. It is often difficult for 
retailers to reconcile and report on actual emissions 
reductions in their value chains because of barriers to 
gathering and allocating reliable data and the lack of 
consistent methodology to adjust industry averages 
to account for particular decarbonization efforts. 
Retailers may also face potential competitive risks 
from disclosing sensitive sales or margin information 
in reporting category- or item-level emissions. As well, 
Scope 3 inventory figures can mask differences in 
decarbonization effort and results: a growing retailer 
that is decarbonizing its value chain may report the 
same percentage change in Scope 3 footprint as 
a shrinking retailer that has not done anything to 
decarbonize its value chain.

Despite these challenges, retailers are managing such 
complexity through the following actions:

 — working with their individual suppliers and data 

aggregators to improve the quality and availability 
of data and the applicability of accounting and 
reporting standard

 — simplifying methodologies to facilitate modeling 
where data is not available and providing order-
of-magnitude estimations of Scope 3 footprint to 
highlight major concentrations of emissions and 
inform priorities for decarbonization

 — providing supplemental information to 

demonstrate impact of decarbonization efforts 
to help stakeholders understand their Scope 3 
decarbonization strategy and contribution and 
their role in emissions reduction

 — improving the practicality of measurement, 

accounting, and reporting by engaging with carbon 
accounting standards bodies, reporting platforms, 
and regulators to help address challenges

Considerations for retailers: Engaging with  
the public sector
On many fronts, reductions in retailers’ Scope 3 
emissions are subject to public sector–led initiatives 
regarding energy and land-use systems; thus, retailers 
would be well served by a deep understanding of 
existing and proposed standards and guidelines. 
Retailers can determine whether or how public 
guidelines related to emissions affect their business 
outlook and the effectiveness of their efforts to 
decarbonize their value chains. Retailers can also 
help create change by advocating for national and 
international climate policies that address the interests 
of stakeholders in their business, value chains, and 
customer communities.

Decarbonizing retailers’ value chains is feasible—but 
it cannot be done in isolation. At-scale deployment of 
the sustainability measures outlined in this report will 
require system-level change involving farmers and 
ranchers, manufacturers, suppliers, nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs), public sector actors, 
energy companies, financial institutions, data and 
technology providers, and consumers. Coordinated 
multistakeholder action is imperative.

Gas Protocol and ISO 14064, the international 
standard series for quantifying and reporting 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals, a retailer’s 
Scope 3 emissions metric captures all greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions generated from sourcing, making, 

transporting, housing, selling, and using every product 
the retailer carries throughout its life cycle (Exhibit 1).

Consequently, the combined Scope 3 emissions from 
all retail channels account for nearly 20 percent of 
total global annual GHG emissions (Exhibit 2).1

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsFor product categories such as food and general 
merchandise, retail value chains typically generate 
emissions within six major energy and land-use 
systems: agriculture and forestry, building, industry, 
mobility, power, and waste. This means that for a 
multicategory retailer, reducing Scope 3 emissions 
involves players from a broad swath of industries and 
entails decarbonization efforts within all six systems.2

The average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions come from 
many types of upstream and downstream sources and 
can vary widely by retail format or channel depending 
on the mix of products carried.3 Around 80 percent 
of Scope 3 emissions for an average retailer are 
generated upstream in value chains via feedstock 

production, materials and components, processing 
and manufacturing, and packaging. Around 20 percent 
of emissions are concentrated downstream, generated 
by transporting goods and by consumers’ use of 
electronics and other electricity-consuming products 
(Exhibit 3).

Given that retailers routinely carry millions of SKUs 
across hundreds of product channels, it is perhaps 
unsurprising that the average retailer’s Scope 3 
emissions make up the overwhelming majority of total 
retail sector emissions: 98 percent. Just 2 percent 
of the sector’s emissions are generated by retailer 
operating activities such as powering facilities, 
refrigeration, transportation, and on-site fuels. 

Given that retailers routinely 
carry millions of SKUs 
across hundreds of product 
channels, it is perhaps 
unsurprising that the average 
retailer’s Scope 3 emissions

2  While sharing energy and land-use systems with other industries is not unique to retail, the range and variety of inputs and product categories in the 

value chains of multicategory retailers are extensive.

Retailer challenges 
in focus: Delineating 
Scope 3 emissions in 
three value chains

19

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsIn addition to the scope and scale of SKUs across 
product categories (ranging from food to apparel to 
electronics) and sourcing geographies, each of the 
product value chains whose emissions are captured in 
a retailer’s Scope 3 includes multiple tiers. The value 
chains also include some highly fragmented markets 
and suppliers located far upstream or downstream 
from retailers. In addition, retailers may lack available, 
reliable emissions data for individual players. All of 
this complexity can make it challenging for retailers to 
influence how suppliers approach, track, or report on 
their emissions.

Consumers’ use of products—powering electronics 
or washing and drying clothing, for example—is also 
captured in the Scope 3 emissions for retailers that 

carry such products. Thus, reducing downstream 
product value chain emissions can often depend on 
changes in consumer behavior.

Examining common value chain scenarios in three 
retail product categories—beef, electronic equipment, 
and apparel—provides insight into the challenges 
facing retailers and their value chain partners in 
addressing Scope 3 emissions.4

The beef value chain: Fragmentation 
and technical limits
Among retailers’ 15 most commonly sold products, 
beef is one of the largest sources of Scope 3 
emissions, and around 86 percent of beef value-chain 
emissions are generated upstream (Exhibit 4A).

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsAnd although cattle ranchers and independent 
animal feed growers are part of beef value chain 
segments with the highest percentage of emissions, 
they may lack an efficient, standard means of 
tracking many of the sources of their emissions—
including methane emitted by cattle. As a result, CDP 
disclosure numbers for such stakeholders may be 
scant or nonexistent. Smaller producers may lack 
capacity to pursue robust decarbonization efforts, 
including cost-saving levers such as variable-rate 
fertilization and low- or no-tillage soil.

To calculate their Scope 3 emissions, animal feed 
aggregators often must survey their small-scale 
suppliers to collect individual energy, chemical, and 
product consumption data to use as reporting inputs. 

Some smaller suppliers may lack the resources or 
standards needed to fulfill aggregators’ requests; 
consequently, the resulting data may be incomplete or 
captured in various formats (Exhibit 4B).

According to McKinsey modeling based on technology 
and costs, the investment implied for beef value chain 
stakeholders to deploy decarbonization measures may 
exceed their annual revenue.5 

The three illustrative examples that follow show the 
potential implications for hypothetical stakeholders 
in three segments of the beef value chain: cattle 
ranching, plant-based animal feed production,  
and fertilizer production for plant-based animal  
feed inputs.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsCattle ranching
Consider a hypothetical cattle ranch with 50 to  
100 cattle, 120 to 240 acres, and an annual income  
of $40,000 to $70,000.6

adopted rather than an extensive unmodified pasture 
system. The required acreage would depend on how 
many cows per acre the rotational grazing system 
could support.8

Many decarbonization measures could ultimately bring 
substantial returns for this hypothetical cattle rancher 
and other ranchers—increasing efficiency and reducing 
costs as well as emissions. Potential measures include 
anaerobic manure digestion, efficiency-focused 
breeding and genetic selection, fat supplements in feed, 
feed processing for improved digestibility, nitrification 
inhibitors in pasture, animal health monitoring and 
illness prevention, regenerative silvopasture, minimized 
time in feedlots, and biodiesel farm machinery.

On the costlier side, switching from a conventional 
feedlot system to an extensive, unmodified grass-fed 
pasture system could require three times more land 
and 30 percent more cattle to yield the same quantity 
of beef annually as a conventional feedlot.7 The 
transition could also require investment of $85,000 
to $170,000 per year. Notably, the amount of land 
needed could be reduced if rotational grazing were 

Plant-based animal feed production
Consider a hypothetical independent animal feed 
grower producing four to five tons of grain per acre 
across 2,400 acres, with net cash flow of around 
$100,000 per year. If implemented at scale, cost-saving 
decarbonization measures—including variable-rate 
fertilization, low or no tillage soil, and cover crops—
could save $127 to $150 per metric ton of CO2 abated.9 
Using controlled-release and stabilized fertilizers and 
converting from flood to drip or sprinkler irrigation may 
cost $74 to $114 per metric ton of CO2 abated, while 
using biodiesel in farm machinery and equipment 
could initially cost $216 per metric ton of CO2 abated.10 
Implementing such measures would likely decrease 
yields initially, but after a four- or five-year transition 
period, yields would recover and this hypothetical feed 
grower could expect to save as much as $2 per metric 
ton of grain produced, or $24,000 per year.11

Many decarbonization measures could 
ultimately bring substantial returns 
for this hypothetical cattle rancher and 
other ranchers—increasing efficiency 
and reducing costs as well as emissions.

11  The cost savings of all levers adopted by an animal feed grower is about $20 per metric ton of CO2 equivalent abated. The reduction potential of all 
such levers is around 2.98 metric tons of CO2 per metric ton of packed beef, and about 25 kilograms (kg) of animal feed are required to produce one 
kg of beef. Therefore, one metric ton of feed produces 0.04 metric ton of beef, and the cost savings per metric ton of grain or feed can be calculated 
as $20 x 2.98 x 0.04 = around $2 per metric ton of grain.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsIndustrial fertilizer production for plant-based  
animal feed inputs
Consider a hypothetical fertilizer supplier producing 
around ten million metric tons of nitrogen per year 
with revenue of $35 billion and cash flow of $5 million 
(assuming industry average margins). Currently, most 
nitrogen-based fertilizer is industrially produced 
using gray ammonia. Switching to nitrogen fertilizers 
based on green ammonia could abate 3 to 6 percent 
of total emissions generated in the beef value chain.12 
Decarbonizing could require as much as $1 billion in 
capital investment over a ten-year transition period to 
establish and implement a renewable energy–based 

power supply, ammonia electrolyzers, and a hydrogen 
substrate for ammonia hydrogen electrolyzers.13 
Ammonia hydrogen electrolyzer technology is 
currently in the early stages of development.

Decarbonization practices can clearly enhance resilience. 
In some instances, such as fertilizer optimization for 
feed, it can also lower costs. Nonetheless, the overall 
transition can present challenges to participants in the 
beef product value chain who may already face economic 
uncertainty due to weather events and market volatility 
(see sidebar “Reducing emissions in the beef value chain:  
A farmer’s perspective”).

Reducing emissions in the beef value chain: A farmer’s perspective

Consider the circumstances of a hypothetical typical American animal feed grower—one of the most 
important stakeholder groups in the beef value chain.

A fourth-generation animal feed farmer in rural Indiana may be concerned with providing economic stability 
for family and workers, maintaining the family farm and passing it on to the next generation, and operating 
sustainably to enhance soil health and crop resilience. At the same time, this farmer may face any number 
of challenges, including weather events such as drought, heat, and flooding that threaten crop yields; debt 
or cash flow issues related to unexpected events and market volatility; and labor shortages.

To transition to lower-carbon farming practices, the farmer’s economic risks and challenges would need 
to be addressed and technical support would be needed. These challenges could be addressed and 
decarbonization achieved by adopting cost saving and neutral solutions such as variable-rate fertilization, 
cover crops, and low or no tillage soil that can help decarbonize but also provide economic benefits and 
improved soil health through enhanced porosity and lower erosional losses. Technical support could 
be provided via land grants and certified crop advisers, building skills in adapting to climate change via 
planting varieties of shorter-duration crops as well as in other agricultural management practices. Finally, 
government grants for climate-adaptive agriculture could also boost cash flow.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsThe electronic-equipment value 
chain: Managing energy use 
Decarbonizing power use—the largest source of 
emissions in this value chain—is the average retailer’s 
primary challenge in the electronic-equipment 
category. These emissions are generated upstream 
via component manufacturing and downstream via 
consumer product use.

And more than 80 percent of the average retailer’s 
Scope 3 emissions in this product category come from 
energy use by suppliers in highly fragmented markets. 
Downstream consumers generate around 11 percent of 
Scope 3 emissions, also almost entirely via electricity 
use (Exhibit 5A).14

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsAbating emissions in the electronic-equipment 
value chain would involve reducing energy use and 
transitioning to clean and renewable energy in places 
where products are manufactured, sold, and used. 
Thus, decarbonizing this value chain largely hinges on 
the availability of renewable energy where suppliers 
operate (Exhibit 5B).

Suppliers include electronics component 
manufacturers located in many regions that have a 
wide range of infrastructure, grid composition, and 

approaches to decarbonization. One of the largest 
suppliers for silicon wafers, for example, is in a region 
where about 85 percent of electricity is generated  
by fossil fuels.15 And because most semiconductor 
manufacturing is energy intensive and dependent 
on fossil fuels, 65 to 80 percent of emissions in an 
electronic-equipment value chain (such as one to 
produce a tablet) are generated at the printed-circuit-
board (PCB) or printed-circuit-board-assembly 
(PCBA) component level.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsPCB and PCBA 
Within the PCB and PCBA supplier value chain 
segment, 57 percent of the average retailer’s Scope 3 
emissions can be attributed to suppliers’ Scope 1  
and 2 sources: purchased electricity, steam, heat,  
and cooling. 

PCB and PCBA players could address these 
emissions by increasing the share of renewables 
in their electricity—through power purchase 
agreements (PPAs), energy attribute certificates 
(EACs), green-procurement contracts with utilities, 
or on-site energy system installations.16 Similarly, by 
engaging downstream players such as transportation 
and mobility companies, processors, and waste 
management companies, PCB and PCBA companies 
could advance decarbonization in segments of 
the value chain for which emissions could be 
underestimated, underreported, and even unreported.

Consider a hypothetical PCBA company producing 
around 15 million wafers each year at ten facilities in 
several regions, with annual revenue of about $70 
billion and cash flow of around $15 billion. 

Potential decarbonization measures for this company 
might include take-back schemes that increase 
circularity, using clean and renewable electricity in the 
PCBA manufacturing process, and using low-GHG-
emitting chemicals in fabrication. Implementing these 
measures at scale by 2030 could reduce emissions 

by around 24 percent. Successful implementation 
would depend on decarbonizing electricity grids such 
that clean- and renewable-energy-based output 
would account for around 20 percent of total energy 
capacity, increasing offshore wind power capacity to 
50 times more than what is currently available, and 
increasing solar power capacity to around four times 
above current levels.17 The full transition could take 
more than ten years and entail investment of more 
than $8 billion.18

Decarbonizing downstream emissions in the 
electronics product value chain similarly depends on 
reducing emissions from electricity use—almost all of 
which are generated by consumer use of electronic 
devices.19 Reducing downstream emissions, which 
account for 11 percent of the average retailer’s total 
Scope 3 emissions for the value chain, would involve 
influencing consumers to reduce their devices’ energy 
use by disabling background apps and services and 
using battery-saver mode in addition to influencing 
shifts toward clean- and renewable-energy grids 
to power consumer households. In practical terms 
this could result in, for instance, more than 130 
million US households using less energy and the 
transition of more than 3,000 utilities to clean and 
renewable energy.20 Nonetheless, retailers may have 
little influence over how a local energy grid network 
generates power.

16  A power purchase agreement (PPA) is a long-term contract (typical length is ten to 20 years) between a business and an electricity provider from 
which the business agrees to purchase energy at a prenegotiated price. Energy attribute certificates (EACs) are instruments that track the origin 
of renewable electricity and its environmental attributes. These documents tell buyers where and when a unit of electricity was produced, which 
technology was employed, and the age of the power plant that generated it, along with other characteristics. Unbundled EACs are typically sold 
by third-party retailers rather than electricity providers. Green procurement contracts with utility companies can include a utility green tariff, a 
contract between a utility and a customer that the customer will procure electricity, and EACs from a clean-energy project (energy generated from 
renewable sources). These projects can be utility- or third-party owned.Businesses can reduce their direct emissions by installing and operating 
renewable energy systems using solar, wind, geothermal, and other power sources onsite.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsLargely concentrated in Southeast Asia, where grid 
decarbonization is low, these upstream suppliers 
operate in a highly fragmented market with minimal 
capacity to implement their own decarbonization 
efforts or influence standards regarding the 
percentage of renewable energy in the power grid 
(Exhibit 6B).

Reducing the average retailer’s downstream Scope 3  
emissions within the apparel value chain is focused 
on product end of life: influencing consumers’ 
habits on the purchasing and waste management 
fronts. Decarbonization measures could include 
manufacturing—and influencing consumers to 

purchase—durable, sustainably produced new apparel 
to reduce overall consumption, as well as promoting 
circularity in fashion via increasing awareness  
and availability of purchasing, reselling, renting, and 
recycling options for used apparel. 

Around 73 percent of the average retailer’s Scope 3 
emissions in the apparel value chain are generated 
upstream by tier-two suppliers and beyond, 
highlighting the need for apparel manufacturing 
suppliers—especially wet processors and textile 
mills—to engage with their upstream suppliers to 
broadly decarbonize the apparel value chain.22

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsThe largest contributors to the average retailer’s  
Scope 3 emissions in this value chain are purchased 
goods and services, which generate 58 percent of the 
average retailer’s total Scope 3 emissions from the 
production of textiles, dyes, and other manufacturing 
inputs.23 Production-related emissions could be 
reduced by sourcing more sustainable materials, 
such as organic cotton and recycled polyester, and by 
minimizing plastic and cardboard packaging. 

Companies of all types and sizes in various segments 
of the apparel value chain could realize meaningful 
emissions reductions and efficiencies from 
implementing decarbonization measures, but there are 
potential obstacles to take into consideration. A closer 
look at hypothetical companies in two value chain 
segments provides insight.

Fiber raw material production
Consider a hypothetical small farmer producing 650 
kilograms of cotton per year on 1.5 hectares in India, 
with annual income of around $6,700.24 Decarbonizing 
such a grower’s operations could include implementing 
regenerative agriculture practices and using biodiesel 
fuel for machinery and equipment. Depending on 
the cropping system, soil, and specific geographic 
context, the grower could need around 1.035 to 1.055 
times more land than used in conventional agriculture 
to compensate for a potential 3.5 to 5.5 percent yield 
loss during the initial three- to five-year transition to 
regenerative agriculture.25 Notably, there may be no 
net loss in crop yield and no further land required, 
and after the initial transition period the grower 

could achieve yield gains of up to 10 to 30 percent—
again depending on the cropping system used, soil, 
and specific geographic context.26 In addition to 
potentially more land, the grower could need training 
and education to implement and sustain renewable 
agricultural practices, predictive modeling, sensors, 
and GPS technology.27 The annual cost to decarbonize 
this stage of the value chain could exceed $30,000; 
however, by implementing such measures at scale, 
the aforementioned grower could save about $37 per 
metric ton of CO2 abated—around $50 per kilogram of 
cotton lint produced, or more than $32,000 per year.28

Garment manufacturing and wet processing
Consider a hypothetical wet processor in India that 
produces around 40 million meters of fabric per year 
in a single facility that employs 2,000 and generates 
annual cash flow of approximately $20 million.29 To 
implement decarbonization measures such as using 
biomass boilers and biogas heating, using renewable 
energy for its operations, reducing its processing 
waste, using low-liquor dyeing machines, and 
redesigning its equipment to optimize efficiency, the 
company would need access to about 400 gigawatts of 
clean and renewable energy capacity by 2050—double 
India’s installed non–fossil fuel capacity as of April 
2024.30 The company’s transition could take ten years, 
but if all the measures listed were implemented at scale, 
the company could reduce its costs by $136 per metric 
ton of CO2 abated, or $36 per meter of woven fabric—a 
total savings of around $1.4 billion per year.31

of an Indian cotton farm is 1.5 hectares; see India: Cotton and products annual, April 2, 2024, Foreign Agricultural Service, USDA. The average annual

cotton T-shirts (see “Cotton sector at a glance,” Economic Research Service, USDA, updated October 11, 2022). The same amount can make about 
2,400 medium-size 60 percent cotton T-shirts—0.09 kg cotton lint per T-shirt. The reduction in cost per metric ton of CO2 abated could be $37. The 
emissions reduction potential of all listed measures is 0.12258 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. So the reduction in cost per T-shirt could be $4.53  
($37 x 0.12258 = $4.53), and the reduction in cost per kg of lint could be $50.33 ($4.53/0.09). Dollar figures are based on technology and costs as of

31  Dollar figures are based on costs as of December 2023. Total reduction in costs realized by deploying all listed measures at scale could be $136 per 
metric tons of CO2 abated, and the total emissions reduction potential could be 0.58857 metric tons of CO2. Cost savings per T-shirt (and per the 
approximately 2.2 meters of woven fabric needed for a medium half-sleeve shirt) is around $80. Cost savings per meter of woven fabric, therefore, 
could be $36. For more, see “How much fabric do you need?,” Fabrics by the Yard, February 23, 2019.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsWhile not part of the apparel value chain, emissions 
generated by consumer use of electricity to wash and 
dry clothing are captured as Scope 3 emissions for 
retailers that carry laundry appliances. Addressing 
these emissions entails influencing widespread shifts 
in consumers’ laundering practices (see sidebar 
“Reducing downstream emissions from laundry 
appliances: A consumer perspective”).

Retailers’ decarbonization trajectory: 
Present and accelerated
Because the average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions 
capture the emissions generated by many other 

industries across six major energy and land-use 
systems around the world, the pace of retail value 
chain decarbonization will generally mirror the pace 
of societal decarbonization. The current pace of 
decarbonization efforts in the systems that affect 
retailers’ Scope 3 emissions metrics could result in 
10.1 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) by 
2030, consistent with a 1.9°C to 2.8°C global warming 
trajectory.32 Staying within a 1.5° pathway could require 
2030 emissions to drop to 5.2 billion metric tons of 
CO2e—30 percent below 2022 levels and 48 percent 
below 2030 levels (estimated based on the current 
pace of decarbonization). And, according 

Reducing downstream emissions from laundry appliances:  
A consumer perspective

When it comes to doing laundry, adults heading a hypothetical Midwestern American family of four with 
an annual household income of around $80,000 are likely motivated primarily by cost and convenience, 
aiming to minimize time and money, including expenses for energy and detergent.

Inspiring these consumers to reduce downstream emissions could involve encouraging them to launder 
their clothing in cold water and to dry it by hanging it up. Enhancing the performance of laundry detergents 
used in cold-water washing could motivate more consumers to choose this option. And high-performance 
laundry detergent formulations such as those that include cold-tolerant amylase and other enzymes could 
help achieve a 35 percent reduction in CO2 emissions generated by washing.1

Appliance manufacturers and retailers can also apply decision science to influence consumers’ laundering 
habits; for example, manufacturers could make cold-water wash the default setting for washers and 
retailers, and manufacturers could support consumers in switching to more energy-efficient appliances by 
offering financing, rebates, and trade-in incentives. Enhancing the overall energy efficiency of appliances 
can also help to maximize consumers’ efforts to reduce their individual carbon footprint.

1  The average estimated greenhouse gas emissions for washing using enzymatic laundry detergent is 500 grams of CO2 per wash cycle 
at 60°C and 330 grams of CO2 per wash cycle at 30°C. See Nazanin Ansari et al., “Enzymes for consumer products to achieve climate 
neutrality,” Oxford Open Climate Change, March 2023, Volume 3, Number 1; Craig Bettenhausen, “The chemistry of cold-water washing,” 
Chemical & Engineering News, January 28, 2024.

32  Refers to estimates of the potential for emissions reduction if the retail industry continues its volume growth in line with growth forecasts and 

continues to scale its decarbonization efforts at the pace modeled in 2023. In this report, the estimate is based on: Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) projected global emissions in 2030 under current pace and decarbonization policies of 53.25 billion metric tons of CO2e. For 
more, see Mehdi Benatiya Andaloussi et al., “Near-term macroeconomic impact of decarbonization policies,” International Monetary Fund, October 
2022. Retail’s share of global emissions in 2022 was 19 percent, which is used as a proxy to estimate its share of IPCC-projected global emissions  
in 2030.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsAt-scale achievement of any of the emissions 
reductions outlined in this chapter would require 
system-level changes that depend on the efforts 
of retailers, farmers and ranchers, manufacturers, 
suppliers, NGOs, public sector entities, energy 
companies, financial institutions, data and technology 
providers, and consumers.

McKinsey has identified seven themes for Scope 3 
emissions reduction for the average retailer, based on 
analysis of technically feasible change levers in several 
product categories and value chains. If implemented at 
scale, such levers could drive a 55 to 65 percent reduction 
in the average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by 2030. 

Levers that reduce or do not increase costs could 
drive 12 to 17 percent of these emissions reductions; 
the remaining 43 to 48 percent of reductions could 
be enabled by levers that may carry some costs or 
considerable costs.33 

Examples in this chapter illustrate emissions reduction 
opportunities within the seven decarbonization 
themes that could be enabled by strategically 
deploying economic resources, natural and physical 
resources, human resources, low-carbon technology, 
and data transparency (Exhibit 8). Additional examples 
are included in the appendix of this report.

McKinsey has identified 
seven themes for Scope 3 
emissions reduction for 
the average retailer, based

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsTransitioning to clean and 
renewable energy
Sustainability measures to support the full potential 
emissions reductions within this decarbonization 
theme depend on adopting clean and renewable 
sources of energy, such as solar-, wind-, and hydro-
generated electricity; bio-based feedstock; biogas; 
biomass boilers; and geothermal energy.

Examples of potential decarbonization measures to 
accelerate the energy transition are organized by the 
type of resource involved and include the following.

Economic resources
Electrifying a meat plant with an annual output of 
approximately five billion pounds of beef (about  
20 percent of annual US beef production) could cost 
$150 per metric ton of CO2 abated.34

Low-carbon technology
By 2030, the global development, integration, and 
adoption of clean and renewable energy technology 
such as wind and solar would need to increase 
four to seven times over 2023 levels to support 
manufacturing hubs on a 1.5° pathway.35

Data transparency 
By using AI, retailers could glean greater detail 
regarding their sustainability metrics, gauge their 
progress against peers, and locate and circumvent 
risks. Using advanced data analytics could also enable 
better integration of renewable energy via improved 
forecasting of demand for the materials needed 
for clean and renewable energy technology. Using 
big data analytics, AI, machine learning, and digital 
technology could reduce global emissions in the 
materials, energy, and mobility sectors 20 percent  
by 2050.36

Reducing farming emissions 
from livestock management
Sustainability measures to support the full potential 
emissions reductions within this decarbonization 
theme include efficiency-focused breeding, anaerobic 
manure digestion, feed processing for improved 
digestibility, nitrification inhibitor use in pastures, fat 
supplement use in feed mix, animal health monitoring 
and illness prevention, regenerative silvopasture, and 
minimized time in feedlots for animals.37

Examples of potential decarbonization measures to 
reduce farming emissions from livestock are organized by 
the type of resource involved and include the following.

Economic resources 
To reduce farming emissions from livestock management 
using current technology, a US beef cattle rancher with 
50 to 100 cattle and around 120 to 240 acres could 
require a total investment of $85,000 to $170,000, at a 
rate of $401 per metric ton of CO2 abated.38

Natural and physical resources 
Adopting an extensive, unmodified grass-fed pasture 
system could require three times more land and 30 
percent more cattle than a feedlot system to produce 
the same amount of beef annually.39 

Low-carbon technology

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsAdopting regenerative practices in 
plant-based agricultural inputs
Sustainability measures to support the full potential 
emissions reductions within this decarbonization 
theme include planting cover crops, using variable-
rate fertilization, using controlled-release and 
stabilized fertilizers, using low- and no-tillage soil, and 
converting from flood to drip or sprinkler irrigation.

Examples of regenerative agriculture measures 
that could potentially enable emissions reductions 
are organized by the type of resources involved and 
include the following.

Natural and physical resources 
During the initial transition from conventional to 
regenerative agriculture, there could be a temporary 
yield loss. This loss could range from net zero up to 30 
percent, depending on the cropping system, soil, and 
geographic context. Additional land may be needed 
to mitigate this temporary yield loss—for example, a 
30 percent yield loss could be compensated for with 
1.3 times more land. After the initial transition period, 
there could be yield gains of up to 10 to 30 percent—
again, depending on the cropping system, soil, and 
geographic context.41

Efficient management of crop land—such as using 
three times less fertilizer in the United States—could 
maximize the effectiveness of decarbonizing solutions 
like nitrification inhibitors and reduce global emissions 
by around 131 million metric tons of CO2 by 2050.42

Reforesting 65 million acres of US land—some 
managed by the US Forest Service, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, and other federal entities and some owned by 
state, local, tribal, and not-for-profit entities—could, 
alongside a number of other measures, help achieve 
a carbon-neutral US economy by 2030. To remain 
carbon neutral, 250 million acres could need to be 
reforested by 2050.43

Human resources 
Technical expertise would be needed to support 
the adoption of precision farming, including use 
of variable-rate fertilization, predictive modeling, 
sensors, and GPS technology.44 

Data transparency
New data architectures and the integration of 
recognized frameworks in internal reporting structures 
can help ensure data is available, standardized, and 
transparent across value chains. This could, in turn, help 
to identify and trace source materials and overcome 
limitations imposed by applying generic data in tracking 
progress on regenerative agricultural practices.45

Increasing circularity of products  
and packaging 
Sustainability measures to support the full potential 
of emissions reductions within this decarbonization 
theme include adopting circular materials such 
as recycled cotton fibers, recycled polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET), and recycled cardboard in 
packaging, and using circular business models such as 
take-back schemes for PCBAs.

Examples of potential measures to enable emissions 
reductions by enhancing product and packaging 
circularity are organized by the type of resources 
involved and include the following.

Economic resources 
Using recycled cotton fibers, recycled PET, and 
recycled cardboard in packaging in apparel 
manufacturing could cost $201 per metric ton of CO2 
abated, while using recycled cotton fibers in garment 
manufacturing could save around $25 per metric ton 
of CO2 abated.46

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsNatural and physical resources
New and expanded waste management infrastructure 
is needed to support increased circularity: for example, 
the European Union would need to increase its recycling 
capacity for municipal solid waste (MSW) by 60 percent 
to hit its 2030 target of 65 percent MSW recycling. It 
would also have to increase its capacity for plastic-
packaging recycling by 122 percent to hit its 2030 
target of recycling 55 percent of plastic packaging.47

Data transparency
Granular and accurate data would be needed to track 
the flow of materials and resources throughout their life 
cycles to support and enhance recycling and circularity.48

Reducing waste and increasing 
process efficiency
Sustainability measures to support the full potential 
emissions reductions within this decarbonization 
theme include minimizing waste throughout the value 
chain—in design, production, consumption, and end 
of life—by increasing efficiency and reducing the 
generation of waste.

Examples of potential measures to enable emissions 
reductions by reducing waste and increasing process 
efficiency are organized by the type of resources 
involved and include the following.

Economic resources
Reducing food waste in the global beef supply chain by 
15 to 20 percent would cost around $59 per metric ton 
of CO2 abated.49

Natural and physical resources
The capacity and technology to reduce pre- and 
postconsumer waste would need to be expanded and 
developed. For example, without expanded waste 
reduction efforts, the average EU recycling rate would 
have to increase to 72 or 73 percent to meet the 
European Union’s 2030 residual waste target.50

And advanced, automated fiber sorting and 
preprocessing technology that can handle fiber 
blends, reduce costs, and improve the quality of 
output could vastly expand the amount of textile 
waste available for fiber-to-fiber recycling in Europe: 
potentially up to 18 to 26 percent of gross textile  
waste by 2030.51

Reducing emissions in transportation
Sustainability measures to support the full potential 
emissions reductions within this decarbonization 
theme include minimizing the environmental impact 
associated with the transportation of goods and 
materials throughout the value chain by transitioning 
to sustainable transportation alternatives such as 
electrification and alternative fuels.

Examples of potential measures to enable emissions 
reductions in transportation are organized by the type 
of resources involved and include the following.

Natural and physical resources
To meet the demand for rare earth elements in 
electric-vehicle (EV) batteries, 384 new mines could 
be needed by 2035.52

Low-carbon technology
To reduce CO2 emissions from value chain 
transportation, transportation players will need to 
adopt supportive infrastructure and low-carbon 
technologies, including charging amenities and EV, 
hybrid, hydrogen fuel–based, and biofuel trucks.

In Europe, an estimated 24 new battery gigafactories 
would need to be established to meet local 
demands for passenger EV batteries, and 15,000 
public chargers and semiprivate chargers (those in 
multifamily homes) would need to be installed each 
week by 2030 to meet demand created by achieving 
the European Union’s net-zero goal for EVs to account 
for 75 percent of global passenger-vehicle sales.53

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsTransitioning from animal protein 
to plant protein products 
Within this decarbonization theme, sustainability 
measures to reduce animal-based protein production, 
consumption, and emissions while expanding plant-
based protein production and consumption include 
developing new technology, scaling up plant-based 
protein production, and encouraging adoption.

Examples of potential measures to enable emissions 
reductions by transitioning from animal to plant protein 
in products are organized by the type of resources 
involved and include the following.

Economic resources
According to McKinsey analysis, capital investment in 
alternative proteins (including plant-based, fermented, 
and cultivated) of $30 billion to $55 billion by 2030 
and $250 billion to $300 billion by 2050 (ranged 
based on achieving a 2°C scenario and 1.5°C scenario) 
could help abate up to seven metric gigatons of CO2.

Natural and physical resources
Shifting to plant-based protein production at the scale 
needed to meet demand and achieve 2030 production 
targets of at least 25 million metric tons of plant-based 
meat annually could require at least 810 factories with 
an average annual production of 30,000 metric tons of 
structured plant protein to serve as the base material 
for meat substitutes.54

Human resources 
According to McKinsey analysis, the consumer 
adoption rate for plant-based proteins would need to 
increase ten- to 15-fold between 2023 and 2030 to 
remain on a 1.5° pathway.55

As the examples in this chapter illustrate, value chain 
stakeholders could deploy a number of potential levers 
to realize emissions reductions in the near term. The next 
chapter provides further details on how decarbonization 
could be approached, prioritized, and achieved. It also 
includes examples of some real-world initiatives.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsSubstantially reducing the emissions that fall within 
the average retailer’s Scope 3 metric will require 
wide-ranging collaborations to transform various 
energy, land-use, and other social systems. Retailers’ 
ability to catalyze such efforts through engagement 
of suppliers, customers, and other value chain 
stakeholders will vary, depending on their proximity to 
the value chain segment involved and the feasibility of 
the required change—for example, technology or cost.

To help retailers prioritize decarbonization efforts, 
this chapter arranges levers that retailers and other 
stakeholders could deploy into four groups. Each 
group of levers could enable strategic decarbonization 
actions, examples of which are illustrated later in this 
chapter by real-world initiatives involving retailers and 
their value chain partners.

 — Group A: Cost-effective near-tier levers. Retailers 

could lead efforts with their direct suppliers 
and their direct suppliers’ suppliers (as well as 
consumers) to deploy these levers and scale 
decarbonization solutions that are either cost 
neutral (creating benefits that offset costs) or 
cost saving (lowering costs). Because of the cost-
effectiveness of levers in this group, retailers 
can consider taking immediate action to lead the 
deployment of these levers at scale, potentially 
reducing the average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions 
by up to 2 percent.

 — Group B: Cost-effective far-tier levers. Retailers 

could influence actions in this category by convening 
suppliers in tier three and beyond (along with other 
industry partners) to deploy cost-saving or cost-
neutral levers to facilitate adoption of sustainability 
measures. Deployed at scale, such efforts could 
potentially help reduce the average retailer’s Scope 3 
emissions by around 11 to 15 percent.

 — Group C: Costlier near-tier levers. Deployed at 

scale, group C levers could potentially help reduce 

the average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions markedly: 
by around 19 to 23 percent. By collaborating with 
their tier-one, tier-two, and tier-three suppliers 
and other value chain partners (including those in 
other industries) to enhance feasibility, retailers 
could catalyze efforts that are costly to implement 
with existing systems or technology (but still 
lower in cost than the predicted global average 
carbon price) and realize potentially substantial 
decarbonization impacts.56 

 — Group D: Cost-prohibitive far-tier levers. Group 
D levers deployed at scale could help realize the 
largest reductions in the average retailer’s Scope 3  
emissions: 25 to 30 percent. Although changes in 
this group of levers are costly to implement with 
current systems or technology, retailers could 
support, advocate, mobilize, and engage suppliers 
beyond tier three and other stakeholders to 
facilitate breakthrough innovation and solutions to 
realize systemwide changes. 

By focusing on the levers in groups A and B, retailers 
could lead and accelerate efforts to achieve up to  
15 percent reduction in the average retailer’s Scope 3  
emissions by 2030. However, a 55 to 65 percent 
reduction could be unlocked if levers in groups C and 
D were deployed in addition to group A and B levers, 
highlighting the importance of multistakeholder 
collaboration to realize substantial impact.

Based on such considerations, retailers can determine 
where they intend to lead, convene, catalyze, or 
advocate actions to reduce emissions in the areas 
outlined in the previous chapter (Exhibit 9). 

There are a number of real-world examples of actions 
taken in all four categories of collaborative emissions 
reduction efforts; many of these are discussed in the 
remaining sections of this chapter.

56  The carbon price estimate is based on technology available as of December 2023 and assumes an average global carbon price of $50 per metric 

ton of CO2, based on a World Bank report (State and trends of carbon pricing 2023, World Bank, 2023) that cites Network for Greening the 
Financial System’s (NGFS) Net Zero 2050 scenario, which suggests that carbon prices need to be around $50 by 2030 in 2010 terms to achieve a 
below 2°C outcome; and on McKinsey analysis estimating the required global carbon price in 2020 at around $40 to $80 to limit warming to 1.5°C.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsGroup A: Cost-effective near-tier levers
As previously noted, retailers can—along with their 
suppliers in the tiers nearest to retailers in product 
value chains—lead sustainability measures that are 
either cost neutral or cost saving.

By leading efforts supported by their value chain 
partners to transition to renewable energy, reduce 
waste, optimize process efficiency, increase circularity 
and recycling, and decarbonize transportation, 

retailers can potentially help reduce the average 
retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by up to 2 percent.

Transitioning to clean and renewable energy 
Retailer-led efforts to replace fossil fuel–dependent 
energy with energy generated by wind, solar, and 
geothermal as well as implementing energy efficiency 
practices such as heat integration could lower the 
average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by around 0.2 
percent (see sidebar “Investment to impact: Reduction 
potential for two retailer-led transitions to renewables”).

Investment to impact: Reduction potential for two retailer-led transitions  
to renewables

The snapshots below highlight the cost (or savings) and impact of retailer-led efforts to implement 
renewable energy use among tier-one and tier-two suppliers in two retail product categories, modeled 
using McKinsey analysis.1

Apparel 
Adopting geothermal energy in the tier-two wet processing stage within a blended-fabric T-shirt value 
chain could save around $62 per metric ton of CO2e abated. Savings are net capital expenditure and 
operating expenses. 

The potential impact? Around 9 percent Scope 3 emissions reduction in the apparel category for the 
average retailer.

Packaged goods
Using sugarcane bagasse for heat generation in the tier-two operation stage of a breakfast bars value 
chain could save around $145 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 5 percent Scope 3 emissions reduction in the packaged goods category for 
the average retailer.

Several additional retailer-led sustainability measures could also help reduce the average retailer’s Scope 
3 emissions in tiers one and two of the apparel product value chain, from transitioning to regenerative and 
organic farming to using closed-loop recycled polyester (exhibit).

modeling suggests that carbon prices need to be around $50 by 2030 in 2010 terms to achieve a below 2°C outcome (State and trends of carbon pricing, World 
Bank, May 2023) and based on McKinsey analysis that the required global carbon price in 2020 is ~$40–$80 to limit warming to 1.5ºC.
2Cost relative to carbon price is measured by benchmarking decarbonization costs against global average carbon pricing of $50 as the opportunity cost. 
3Cost neutral refers to a reduction cost of $0/MtCO₂ equivalent.

high level of inﬂuence over entire supply chain.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsIrrespective of product category, there are numerous 
effective retailer-led actions that could reduce 
emissions in suppliers’ value chains.

Retailer-led efforts to switch to clean and renewable 
electricity. Retailers can encourage their suppliers to 
adopt clean and renewable energy by working with 
value chain partners to enable suppliers’ transition. 
For example, Walmart and Schneider Electric 
developed the Gigaton PPA program, and five suppliers 
collaborated under the program to purchase about 
250,000 megawatt-hours of renewable energy 
annually from Ørsted, a renewable energy company, 
which is equivalent to avoiding carbon emissions from 
more than 450,000 gasoline-powered passenger cars 
driven for one year.57 Levi Strauss & Co, a supplier that 
participated in this initiative, is projected to power its 
operations with 100 percent renewable electricity  
by 2025.58

Buyers Institute (CEBI) to launch the Clean Energy 
Procurement Academy (CEPA), which helps equip 
companies and suppliers with the skills and knowledge 
they need to investigate their options and adopt 
renewable energy.59

Promoting sustainable consumption with consumer-
focused marketing and tools. Retailer-led marketing 
campaigns and consumer-facing tools can raise 
consumer awareness about the benefits of adopting 
energy efficient products and shifting their habits 
to reduce their personal carbon footprints. These 
campaigns can effect considerable changes. For 
example, detergent maker Tide launched Turn to Cold, 
a joint campaign with Walmart to promote cold-water 
use in washing cycles. The goal was for 75 percent of 
North American laundry loads to use cold water by 
2030, potentially avoiding 27 million metric tons of  
CO2 emissions.60

Supporting suppliers’ net-zero implementations. 
Retailers can assist suppliers in navigating the 
complex process of implementing sustainability 
measures in service of net-zero targets. Specifically, 
retailers can provide guidance for permitting, supplier 
due diligence, and training to help suppliers cultivate 
the technical skills and knowledge they need. 
One real-world example of this approach is Nike’s 
partnership with the not-for-profit Clean Energy 

Reducing waste and increasing process efficiency
Retailer-led efforts to reduce waste and optimize 
processing efficiency, particularly in packaging 
and postconsumer use, could realize substantial 
reductions—around 0.6 percent of the average 
retailer’s Scope 3 emissions—in various retail product 
value chains (see sidebar “Investment to impact: 
Reduction potential for two retailer-led efforts to 
reduce waste and optimize processes”).

The following snapshots highlight the 
cost (or savings) and emissions impact of 
retailer-led efforts to reduce waste and 
realize process efficiencies among tier-one 
suppliers in two retail product categories, 
modeled using McKinsey analysis.1

Tissue
It could cost a retailer nothing to switch to 
tier-one suppliers within the toilet tissue 
roll value chain with lower manufacturing-
based emissions.

Apparel
Reducing waste in tier-one manufacturing 
and processing within a blended-fabric 
t-shirt value chain could save around  
$170 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 9 percent 
Scope 3 emissions reduction in the toilet 
tissue category for the average retailer.

The potential impact? Around 6 percent 
Scope 3 emissions reduction in the apparel 
category for the average retailer.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsPromoting suppliers’ use of innovation to enhance 
efficiency. Retailers can engage with their major tier-
one and tier-two suppliers on innovative approaches 
to improving efficiency. For example, Unilever worked 
with one of its suppliers to develop new enzyme 
solutions. The two enzyme innovations improved 
product performance and helped Unilever’s customers 
save energy, thereby reducing CO2 emissions.61

Collaborating to expand sustainable-packaging use. 
With their supplier partners, retailers can invest in 
capabilities and technologies to support sustainable 
packaging. Industry guidelines and incentives on 
sustainable packaging can facilitate adoption. For 
example, Nike’s One Box design, which involves 
shipping shoes from online orders in the original shoe 
box (without an outer box), resulted in a 51 percent 
reduction in packaging waste.62

Empowering consumers to reduce waste via discounts 
and rewards. Retailers can introduce programs that 
enable consumers to reduce waste and provide monetary 
incentives such as pricing discounts and rewards to 
encourage them to engage with the programs.

For example, Patagonia’s Worn Wear program allows 
customers of the outdoor-clothing company to 
reduce waste and refresh their wardrobes. As part of 
this program, the company accepts previously worn 
Patagonia clothing in good condition in exchange for 

credit toward purchases of new Patagonia items.63 In 
addition, coffee retailer Starbucks provides a $0.10 
discount to customers who use their own mugs. This 
not only reinforces sustainable habits but also reduces 
overall waste and yields cost savings on cups.64

Empowering consumers to reduce resource 
consumption via awareness campaigns. Retailers can 
establish marketing campaigns to help raise awareness 
of eco-friendly consumption and encourage adoption 
of eco-friendly habits. For example, clothing retailer 
Levi’s partnered with not-for-profit Water.org on the Go 
Water<Less campaign to educate the public on water 
use and simple best practices to reduce personal water 
consumption. Levi’s Water<Less process to reduce the 
amount of water used in denim finishing had saved more 
than 3.0 billion liters of water and recycled more than

from transportation

The following snapshots highlight the cost  
(or savings) and potential impact of retailer-
led efforts to reduce emissions from 
transportation among tier-one suppliers 
in two retail product categories, modeled 
using McKinsey analysis.1

Packaged goods 
Electrifying the transportation of wheat 
used by tier-one suppliers in a breakfast 
bars value chain could save $101 per metric 
ton of CO2e abated. 

The potential impact? A 4 percent reduction 
in Scope 3 emissions in the packaged goods 
category for the average retailer.

Dairy
Electrifying transport from farm to 
processing and from processing to retail 
for suppliers in tiers one and two of a milk 
value chain could save $335 per metric ton 
of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 4.6 percent 
reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the dairy 
category for the average retailer.

group are cost-neutral or cost-saving to implement but 
involve tier-three suppliers—those further removed from 
retailers in the value chain than retailers’ direct suppliers 
or their suppliers. 

This is an increasingly popular option among retailers: 
Walmart, Target, and Costco have installed, or announced  
plans to install, EV charging stations at their stores and 
warehouses.66 Walmart, in fact, has more than 1,300 
charging stations in 280 facilities across the United 
States and has announced plans to build an EV fast-
charging network at thousands of its locations by 2030.67  
Target has partnered with ChargePoint, Electrify America,  
and Tesla to deploy EV charging stations at its stores.68 
IKEA has installed 322 EV charging stations across  
54 properties and has announced plans to install 500  
public fast chargers and more than 300 fleet chargers.69

As noted at the beginning of this chapter, efforts in this 

By taking actions to encourage their tier-three value chain 
partners to reduce livestock farming emissions, adopt 
regenerative agriculture practices, reduce waste and 
optimize processes, and increase circularity and recycling, 
retailers could potentially help reduce the average 
retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by around 11 to 15 percent.

Adopting regenerative practices in plant-based  
agricultural inputs  
Retailer-accelerated efforts to encourage adoption 
of regenerative agriculture practices in tier-three 
plant-based product inputs could reduce the average 
retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by around 5 percent (see 
sidebar “Investment to impact: Reduction potential 
for two retailer-accelerated efforts to encourage 
regenerative practices”).

Investment to impact: Reduction potential for two retailer-accelerated efforts to 
encourage regenerative practices

The snapshots below highlight the savings and impact of retailer-accelerated efforts to adopt regenerative 
agriculture practices in tier-three plant-based input suppliers in two categories of retail products, modeled 
using McKinsey analysis.1

Packaged goods
Adopting no-tillage soil, biofertilizers, organic farming, straw management, dry seeding for rice, variable-
rate fertilization for wheat, and rice water management (drip irrigation) in tier-three crop growing within a 
breakfast bar value chain could save $690 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 37 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions within the breakfast bars 
category of packaged goods for the average retailer.

Apparel
Adopting regenerative agriculture and organic farming in tier-three cotton crop growing within a blended 
fabric t-shirt value chain could save $179 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 11 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the apparel category for the 
average retailer.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chains 
Setting supplier standards under deforestation-free 
and conversion-free (DCF) policies. In their DCF 
policies, retailers can set standards for plant-based 
agricultural input suppliers to source commodities 
that are deforestation- and conversion-free.70 For 
example, Walmart set goals and approaches for 
suppliers to source deforestation- and conversion-
free commodities.71 

Providing training and resource initiatives to help upskill 
farmers in sustainable practices. Retailers and their 
value chain partners provide training and resources 
to help upskill farmers in sustainable agriculture 
practices. For example, one value chain partner, 
American multinational Tyson Foods, provides training 
and education to farmers on measuring emissions from 
their value chain and regenerative practices to reduce 
emissions via its Local Grain Services (LGS) Sustain 
initiative.72 Similarly, PepsiCo sponsors employees from 
its suppliers, bottlers, and contract manufacturers to 
participate in the Supplier Leadership on Climate Action 
(SLoCT) school.73 Participants attend at least two cycles 
of seminars annually and have access to resources to 
guide efforts to address climate change and set science-
based targets.

Providing emissions reduction training and education 
for farmers. Retailers can offer educational and 
training programs, including one-to-one coaching and 
webinars, to help ranchers reduce farming emissions. 
For example, Nestlé’s training platform for more 
than 40,000 farmers participating in one of Nestlé’s 
agripreneurship programs focuses on regenerative 
agriculture practices and improving farms’ resilience to 
climate change impacts.74

Forming alliances to share and collaborate on best 
practices. Retailers can join with peer companies and 

their value chain stakeholders to share best practices 
for reducing waste and maximizing process efficiency. 
For example, the Retail Industry Leaders Association 
(RILA) has engaged its member companies on 
several sustainability topics, including zero waste and 
sustainable sourcing.75

Engaging feed aggregators via long-term contracts. 
Retailers can engage with feed aggregators via long-
term contracts to help signal demand for sustainably 
grown crops, bolstered by private investor support. 
For example, PepsiCo signed a 7.5-year commercial 
agreement with agriculture and nutrition multinational 
ADM to expand the use of regenerative agriculture 
within their shared supply chains.76

Collaborating with suppliers to use incentives to 
promote sustainable farm practices. Retailers and 
their value chain partners can use incentives such 
as blended financing and carbon credit purchases 
to engage suppliers in implementing sustainable 
practices. Luxury goods retailer Kering did just that, 
providing grant support to help cotton and cashmere 
producers across one million hectares transition to 
regenerative agriculture practices.77 

Standard setters and agencies could work with 
stakeholders to design farmer incentive programs 
that could be adopted and implemented broadly. 
For example, Farmer First Clusters—an initiative of 
the Soft Commodities Forum (SCF), composed of 
agribusiness companies ADM, Bunge, Cargill, COFCO 
International, Louis Dreyfus Company, and Viterra—
provides farmers with incentives to implement climate-
smart agricultural practices and restore degraded 
lands. Emissions generated by farms participating in 
the Farmer First Clusters initiative are traceable, and 
program outcomes have the capacity to abate the

Reducing waste and increasing process efficiency
Retailer-accelerated efforts to reduce waste and 
optimize processing efficiency in tier-three supplier 
operations could lower total Scope 3 emissions for  
the average retailer by around 4.5 percent (see  
sidebar “Investment to impact: Reduction potential for 
two retailer-accelerated efforts to reduce waste and 
optimize processes”).

Promoting suppliers’ adoption of lean manufacturing. 
Retailers can promote the adoption of lean 
manufacturing principles throughout their supply 
chains by engaging their in-network suppliers via 
supplier contracts. For example, Nike created the 
Nike Lean Supplier Capability program to promote the 
adoption of lean manufacturing practices among its 
suppliers, which resulted in a 50 percent reduction in 

defect rates, 40 percent faster lead times, and  
20 percent improvement in productivity.79

Scaling decarbonization technologies to increase 
process efficiency via public–private collaboration. 
Public sector players can work with private 
sector players to improve efficiency. For example, 
SmartWay, a voluntary collaboration between the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and truck and 
rail carriers, shippers, and logistics companies, seeks 
to improve fuel efficiency and reduce environmental 
impacts from moving goods. More than 3,000 logistics 
companies are registered with SmartWay.80

Mobilizing value chain partners to reduce waste 
via systemwide collaboration. Retailers can inform 
customers about storage methods and best-by dates 
to help reduce food waste, while partnering with food 
manufacturers to provide discounts on these products. 
For example, Canadian grocery retailer Loblaw 
partnered with digital discount food marketplace

Chemicals and pharmaceuticals
Increasing the manufacturing throughput rate via continuous manufacturing and waste reduction during 
tier-three suppliers’ active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production in an ibuprofen value chain could 
save $42 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 6 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals category for the average retailer.

Tissue
Improving post-press dryness by switching to steel Yankee technology in tier-three paper production within 
a toilet roll value chain could save $12 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 14 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the toilet tissue category for the 
average retailer.

Group C: Costlier near-tier levers 
As outlined at the beginning of this chapter, 
collaborative efforts in this group present 
opportunities to achieve substantial decarbonization 
impact: potentially around a 19 to 23 percent reduction 
in the average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions, if 
implemented at scale. While these actions may carry 
implementation costs—still below the global average 
carbon price—given existing systems or technology, 
they also present opportunities for retailers to 
collaborate and innovate with their tier-one, tier-two, 
and tier-three value chain partners to lower the cost of 

adoption.82 Actions include reducing livestock farming 
emissions, transitioning to clean and renewable 
energy, increasing circularity and recycling, replacing 
animal protein with plant protein in products, adopting 
regenerative agriculture practices, and reducing waste 
while optimizing processes.

Reducing farming emissions from livestock  
management
Collaborative efforts and investments to reduce 
emissions from livestock management in farming within 
tiers one to three could yield a 9.1 percent reduction in 
total Scope 3 emissions for the average retailer (see 
sidebar “Investment to impact: Reduction potential 
for collaborative efforts to reduce livestock farming 
emissions among suppliers in tiers one to three”).

Investment to impact: Reduction potential for collaborative efforts to reduce 
livestock farming emissions among suppliers in tiers one to three

The snapshots below highlight the cost and impact of collaborative efforts to reduce livestock farming 
emissions among tier one to three suppliers in two categories of retail products, modeled using  
McKinsey analysis.1

Dairy 
The cost to deploy management-intensive grazing within tier-three dairy cattle ranching in a milk value 
chain could be $36 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 16 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the dairy category for the 
average retailer.

Beef 
The cost to implement anaerobic manure digestion in tier-three beef cattle ranching in a beef value chain 
could be $11 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 12 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the beef category for the 
average retailer.

There are several other sustainability measures that could help reduce the average retailer’s Scope 3 
emissions in the beef product value chain, from switching to recyclable plastics and modifying package 
designs to electrifying meat plants (exhibit).

November 8, 2022.

82  The carbon price estimate is based on technology available as of December 2023 and assumes an average global carbon price of $50 per metric 

ton of CO2, based on a World Bank report (State and trends of carbon pricing 2023, World Bank, 2023) that cites Network for Greening the 
Financial System’s (NGFS) Net Zero 2050 scenario, which suggests that carbon prices need to be around $50 by 2030 in 2010 terms to achieve a 
below 2°C outcome; and on McKinsey analysis estimating the required global carbon price in 2020 at around $40 to $80 to limit warming to 1.5°C.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsParticipating in trade associations and engaging 
in discussions with cattle traders. By participating 
in trade associations and discussions with cattle 
traders, retailers can help boost long-term demand 
signals for sustainably produced beef, which could be 
supported by public incentives for farmers to increase 
sustainable beef farming production.83 For example, 
Canada’s largest grocery retailer, Loblaw, partnered 
with trade association Canadian Roundtable for 
Sustainable Beef (CRSB) to purchase three million 
pounds of beef from CRSB-certified farms.84

Collaborating with others to support research on 
advancing sustainability measures. Retailers can 
collaborate with value chain partners, not-for-profits, 
and research institutions on research and innovative 
processes to increase sustainable farming practices.
For example, Cargill, McDonald’s, and Target partnered 
with Colorado State University and the Nature 
Conservancy on a research project to regeneratively 
grow corn used in feed inputs.85

Supporting innovations that reduce farming emissions 
via public–private research collaborations. Research 
organizations can innovate to reduce farming emissions 
by using feed supplements in livestock farming with 
the support of private and/or public organizations. For 
example, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
and a private nutritional-products manufacturing 
company supported the Department of Animal 
Science at Pennsylvania State University on in-depth 
research into the effects of adding 3-Nitrooxypropanol 
(3-NOP) to dairy cow feed, finding that the additive 
reduced enteric methane emissions by 25 percent. 
This researchsupported the approval of 3-NOP for 
use in the European Union and some South American 
countries.86

Helping value chain partners distribute costs and 
resources via public sector–led incentive programs. 
The Canadian government’s $12 million investment 
in the Reducing Enteric Methane Emissions from 

Beef Cattle (REME) protocol is aimed at providing 
an incentive for actions not subject to carbon pricing 
mechanisms that reduce livestock emissions beyond 
the level required by law.87

Transitioning to clean and renewable energy
Supplier and value chain partner engagement to replace 
fossil fuel–dependent energy with energy generated 
by wind, solar, and geothermal could lower Scope 3 
emissions for the average retailer by around 7.7 percent 
(see sidebar “Investment to impact: Reduction potential 
for three retailer-led transitions to renewables”).

Using supplier engagement criteria to encourage 
and accelerate renewable adoption. Retailers can set 
supplier engagement criteria that provide suppliers 
with compelling incentives to adopt renewable energy. 
Automaker Porsche did just that when it informed 
its approximately 1,300 series suppliers that it would 
consider signing contracts only with those that use 
renewable energy.88 The automaker also includes 
sustainability ratings as a criterion for awarding all 
supplier contracts; consequently, more than 90 percent 
of Porsche’s suppliers have a valid sustainability 
rating.89 Similarly, Carrefour’s 2026 strategic plan states 
that the company’s top 100 suppliers must adopt a 
1.5°C trajectory by 2026; suppliers that do not meet this 
criteria will be delisted.90

Retailers could also provide suppliers with incentives 
in the form of financing to accelerate suppliers’ 
adoption of clean technology. Walmart, for example, 
integrated science-based targets into its supplier 
financing program. Walmart suppliers that set at least 
three sustainability goals and demonstrate efforts 
toward a science-based target on the 1.5° pathway 
may access favorable financing terms from Walmart’s 
partner, HSBC Bank.91

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsand to reduce emissions from animal protein production 
could achieve around 1.3 percent reduction in total 
Scope 3 emissions for the average retailer (see sidebar 
“Investment to impact: Reduction potential for a retailer-

2023. The retailer also created a new plant-based 
coalition that includes seven companies—Danone, 
Unilever, Bel, Andros, Bonduelle, Nutrition & Santé, 
and Savencia—with the goal of generating €3 billion in 
sales from alternative plant-based products by 2026.93

Facilitating the transition to plant-based protein. 
Retailers can take part in campaigns and help 
stimulate a consumer shift from animal-based protein 
to plant-based protein. Target, for instance, uses 
wellness icons on its physical and digital shelves and 
signage on its freezer and refrigerator cases to denote 
products that are cruelty free and vegan, including 
plant-based alternative proteins.92 And Carrefour 
launched the Act for Food program in 2018 to facilitate 
the food transition to alternative protein, reporting 
€514 million in sales of plant-based alternatives in 

Engaging feed aggregators in long-term contracts for 
alternative-protein ingredients. To help signal demand 
for alternative protein, retailers and their value chain 
partners can engage suppliers in long-term contracts 
for plant-based ingredients. For example, in 2020 one 
value chain partner, food multinational Cargill, invested 
$75 million in PURIS, the largest pea protein producer 
in North America, to increase production of peas.94

Collaborating on promotional campaigns to raise 
consumer awareness about alternative plant proteins. 
Retailers could partner with not-for-profits such as the

Several additional sustainability measures could help reduce the average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions 
in the product value chain, including switching to renewable electricity in input, component, and device 
production; switching to biogas for heating; electrifying transport; and switching from plastic to recycled 
cardboard in packaging (exhibit).

1Using an average global carbon price of 50 $/metric ton (Mt) of CO₂ based on World Bank report that states that Network for Greening the Financial System’s 
modeling suggests that carbon prices need to be around $50 by 2030 in 2010 terms to achieve a below 2°C outcome (State and trends of carbon pricing, World 
Bank, May 2023) and based on McKinsey analysis that the required global carbon price in 2020 is ~$40–$80 to limit warming to 1.5ºC.
2Cost relative to carbon price is measured by benchmarking decarbonization costs against global average carbon pricing of $50 as the opportunity cost. 
3Cost neutral refers to a reduction cost of $0/MtCO₂ equivalent.

Group D: Cost-prohibitive far-tier levers
As outlined at this chapter’s outset, collaborative 
efforts in group D could realize profound reductions in 
Scope 3 emissions for the average retailer: potentially 
25 to 30 percent, if implemented at scale. These 
efforts entail systemic changes that can only be 
realized with coordinated multistakeholder actions, 
involving suppliers and value chain stakeholders that 
are beyond tier three in retailers’ networks, as well as 
other public and private sector players. The initiatives 
are too costly to implement in the near term because 
the systems or technology to support them are either 
nonexistent or in the early stages of development. 
Nevertheless, these substantial and wide-ranging 
decarbonization impacts could be realized with a 
shared sense of urgency among all stakeholders 
to achieve systemic innovation through strategic, 
targeted advocacy and support; the mobilization of 
coalitions and initiatives; and convening actions to 
increase the use of renewable energy, regenerative 
agriculture practices, and recycling while reducing 
emissions from livestock, waste, and transportation. 

Transitioning to clean and renewable energy
Replacing fossil fuel–dependent energy with energy 
generated by wind, solar, and geothermal could lower 
the average retailer’s Scope 3 emissions by around 
7.4 percent. Doing so would require infrastructure 
builds, developing new technology and processes, 
and shifting societal priorities, alongside demand 
management and long-distance interconnections to 
pool renewable assets across a larger geographic 
area. While timelines could be lengthy and total 
costs may be steep, the decarbonization potential 
is meaningful (see sidebar “Investment to impact: 
Reduction potential for three coalition-mobilized 
transitions to renewables”).96

Beef 
Replacing beef volumes with alternative, 
sustainably produced meat-like proteins among 
tier-three suppliers could cost around $36 
(incremental) per metric ton of CO2e abated.2

The potential impact? Around 82 percent 
reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the beef 
category for the average retailer.

can help expand the use of renewables for feedstock. 
For instance, as part of BASF’s Waste-2-Chemicals 
project, social entrepreneurs and local waste pickers 
gather plastic waste that is then sorted and processed 
into pyrolysis oil for use as feedstock for new plastic.97

Supporting grid greening and renewable technology 
via initiatives led by the public and private sectors. 
Public sector–led initiatives can help realize large-scale 
expansions in the use of renewable-energy grids. For 
example, India announced a target installation of 500 
gigawatts (GW) of renewable-energy capacity by 2030 
to reduce the use of coal and oil as sources of energy, 
aiming to reduce the emissions intensity of its economy 
by 45 percent and CO2 emissions by one billion tons.98 
And in 2020, Canada created a decarbonization 
incentive program (DIP) that provides around $364,000 
to $1.5 million in funding to support clean-technology 
projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions.99

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsInvestment to impact: Reduction potential for three coalition-mobilized 
transitions to renewables

The snapshots below highlight three transitions to renewables requiring the mobilization of a coalition 
of private and public sector players, modeled using McKinsey analysis.1 Lead times are long because 
technology, infrastructure, or other enablers are nonexistent or in very early stages of development, but 
innovations could potentially shorten the timelines. 

Chemicals and pharmaceuticals 
The cost to switch to biogas in all tier-three supplier production within an ibuprofen value chain could be 
around $120 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 31 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals category for the average retailer.

Chicken
Switching to renewable electricity throughout tier-one suppliers’ value chains in a chicken value chain 
could cost around $55 (incremental) per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around 14 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the chicken category for the 
average retailer.

Beef
The cost of switching from gray to green ammonia in fertilizer production among suppliers in tier four and 
beyond within a beef value chain could be around $45 (incremental) per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around a 6 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the beef category for the 
average retailer.

chicken category on one three-pound package of boneless chicken; and for the beef category on a three-pound package of boneless beef.

Private sector initiatives can make substantial impacts 
on grid greening via targeted community-level projects 
and beyond. As part of its energy transformation 
strategy, in March 2024 Walmart announced the 
addition of two community solar and distribution 
portfolios developed by Pivot Energy and Reactivate to 
its existing renewable-energy investment portfolio. The 
included projects’ total output will be 70 megawatts of 
alternating current from 26 new community solar and 
distributed-generation installations in six states. When 
operational, the installations will provide about 160,000 
megawatt-hours (MWh) of clean energy each year to 
around 13,000 US households in support of community 
solar subscriptions. The resulting $6 million in cost 

savings is expected to benefit low- to moderate-income 
communities.100

Increasing circularity and recycling
Coalition-mobilized efforts to increase circularity 
and recycling could reduce total Scope 3 emissions 
by around 4.6 percent for the average retailer (see 
sidebar “Investment to impact: Reduction potential for 
two actions to increase circularity and recycling”).

Collaborating with suppliers and value chain 
partners to improve circularity. Retailers can engage 
suppliers to act further on circularity and recycling 
by collaborating to initiate reuse and promote sales 
of refurbished items. For example, Walmart recently 
launched Walmart Restored, a program that enables

The snapshots below highlight the cost and impact of actions to increase circularity and recycling 
among suppliers in two retail product categories, modeled using McKinsey analysis.1

Chemicals and pharmaceuticals
The cost to implement mechanical recycling at tier-four suppliers within an ibuprofen value chain could be 
around $57 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around a 3 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals category for the average retailer.

Apparel
The cost to implement the use of closed-loop recycled polyester by tier-two suppliers in a blended-fabric 
t-shirt value chain could be around $148 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Around a 7 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the apparel category for the 
average retailer.

consumers to purchase renewed and refurbished 
products that have been inspected, tested, and 
cleaned by either the manufacturer or manufacturers, 
a manufacturer-authorized party, or other qualifying 
sellers or suppliers. Each purchase comes with a 
90-day free return or replacement guarantee.101

Facilitating access to recycling options. Retailers can 
use store locations as collection centers for recyclable 
materials and provide incentives for consumers to 
engage in recycling behaviors. Carrefour partnered with 
Greenbig, a French plastics recycling robotics start-
up, to install B:Bot XXL recycling machines, each with 
a storage capacity of 50,000 bottles, at 31 Carrefour 
hypermarket parking lots, where customers can recycle 
plastics that are then used to produce straws, bottles, 
and textile fiber. Consumers receive $0.02 for each 
container they scan, and the amount they accumulate 
can be converted into a donation to an association or a 
voucher that is valid at the point of sale.102

Establishing joint ventures to support rare earth 
element recycling and sustainable sourcing. 
Partnering with renewable-energy-technology 
companies, retailers can help foster the capacity 
to recycle rare earth elements (REE) and provide 
alternatives to supplies concentrated in one or a few 
geographic areas. For example, BMW i Ventures, 
a subsidiary of BMW group, co-led a $27 million 
investment in a circular supply chain company focused 
on recycling REE.103

Helping fund circular initiatives and investments in 
recycling projects via private sector alliances. Closed 
Loop Partners, one such alliance, spans multiple 
industries. It has established a foundation for physical 
infrastructure expansion, launched local recycling with 
PepsiCo to expand recycling access, and established 
the Center for the Circular Economy, an effort to 
accelerate innovation and research, which launched a 
composting consortium aimed at reducing GHG

Partners has kept 740,000 metric tons tons of materials 
in circulation, avoided 736,000 metric tons of CO2, and 
saved 1.1 billion liters of water over the past decade.104

Investing in a circular economy via private sector 
initiatives and coalitions. Coalitions of financial 
institutions and private investors can also take action 
to improve the circular economy. For example, the 
World Bank issued a $100 million, seven-year bond  
to support plastic-recycling projects. Through  
the project, investors are providing approximately  
$14 million in up-front financing to increase capacity 
at existing recycling facilities and to expand to new 
collection and recycling sites. In return, investors 
receive annual coupons for a fixed amount plus 
payments linked to the sale of a portion of the  
recycled products and carbon credits produced by  
the projects.105

Recycling is another key lever that can help reduce 
the impact of the retail value chain on nature, because 
plastics pollution increases the acidification of 
oceans, which kills fish and reduces the efficacy of 
the carbon sink that currently captures 31 percent 
of CO2 emissions.106 Reducing the amount of plastic 
in packaging, implementing new delivery models, 
expanding mechanical and chemical recycling of 
plastics, and using compostable bioplastics could help 
the retail sales and services sector address 52 percent 
of the overage in plastic pollution while improving 
nature conservation.107

Adopting regenerative practices in plant-based  
agricultural inputs
The actions outlined in this section to adopt 
regenerative agriculture practices for plant-based 
product inputs could reduce total Scope 3 emissions 
for the average retailer by around 3.8 percent (see 
sidebar “Investment to impact: Reduction potential for 
adopting regenerative agriculture practices in plant-
based input production”)

category, modeled using McKinsey analysis.1

Beef
The cost to deploy the use of controlled-release 
and stabilized fertilizers in animal feed among 
suppliers in tier four and beyond could be around 
$74 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

If suppliers in tier four and beyond were to 
implement variable-rate fertilization, it could save 
around $150 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

If suppliers in tier four and beyond were to  
adopt low- or no-tillage soil, it could save around 
$147 per metric ton of CO2e abated.

The potential impact? Each of the above levers 
could result in about a 3 percent reduction in 
Scope 3 emissions in the beef category for the 
average retailer.

incentives can help enable the implementation of 
regenerative agriculture practices, which are critical 
to scaling many of the solutions outlined in this report 
and beyond. The US Agricultural Resilience Act (ARA), 
for example, aims to expand USDA support for farmers 
to combat climate change and regenerate ecosystems 
by providing grants up to $500,000 to support 
soil carbon restoration, farmland elimination, and 
greenland conversion as part of other efforts to help 
achieve the ARA’s stated goal of net-zero emissions 
from US agriculture by 2040.108 And the USDA’s

companies. Start-ups and technology companies 
can develop new tools and capabilities to support

technology that enables real-time crop data 
monitoring for more than 1,200 users. The company 
has reported saving five billion liters of water from the 
70,000 acres of farmland connected to its platform.110 

Decarbonizing transportation
The actions outlined in this section to decarbonize 
transportation could reduce total Scope 3 emissions 
by around 1.4 percent for the average retailer (see 
sidebar “Investment to impact: Reduction potential for 
two actions to decarbonize transportation”).

Providing incentives for the production, distribution, 
and ownership of electric vehicles via public 
sector–led initiatives. Electrifying transportation 
is a vital lever to reducing mobility sector emissions 
worldwide, and incentives can offer a wide-reaching 
means of encouraging EV adoption. For example, 
the US Department of Energy offers grants and loan 
guarantees for the domestic production of efficient 
hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and 
all-electric vehicles. There is also a $3,700 to $7,500 
US federal tax credit for purchases of some all-electric 
and plug-in hybrid vehicles.111 Faster Adoption and

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chains 
estimates on extrapolation of supplier data, publicly 
available emissions factors based on broad industry 
averages, and assumptions in line with standards 
such as the GHG Protocol. Thus, for many retailers, 
assessing their Scope 3 emissions footprint is more 
of a modeling exercise based on broad and shifting 
aggregate assumptions than a measurement exercise.

Because Scope 3 does not allow retailers to manage 
action plans but only prioritize their main emission 
sources, transparency is vital in presenting carbon 
footprint figures—the methods used and the level of 
data precision and estimation, for example—as the 
figures are not indicators of performance but rather an 
estimate of major Scope 3 items.

Year-over-year fluctuations in modeled footprint due 
to shifting assumptions and methodologies should 
trigger a base-year footprint recalculation and often 
exceed the annual rate of emissions reductions 
companies are expected to report to stay on pace 
with a 1.5° or 2° pathway, which can make it difficult to 
demonstrate progress. 

Based on the GHG Protocol, the Scope 3 metric does 
not include the emissions impact of company initiatives 
outside of retail operations and product supply chains, 
such as nature restoration, customer food waste, 
renewable-energy projects in communities (such 

as community solar), or expansion of EV charging 
capacity for customers. The decarbonization impact  

from such initiatives can be substantial; while a company 
may report them separately from a GHG Protocol 
inventory, their impact is not currently reflected in the 
Scope 3 footprint metric. However, the GHG Protocol and 
the market-based accounting approaches workstreams 
in the revision process are considering both the impact 
of reductions and the best way to accurately account 
for and report the impact of supply-shed reductions or 
activities outside of a company’s value chain.

Similarly, carbon accounting protocols require companies 
to account for global deforestation that occurred 
before the date a retailer’s deforestation-free sourcing 
procedures went into effect, whether or not a retailer has 
sourced commodities from affected regions. According 
to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), emissions from single events of land-use change, 
such as deforestation, are amortized over 20 years to 
attribute the emissions to the activities that occur over 
the year of use. This means that a retailer that has set 
2020 DCF policies and is sourcing from farmers who 
practice sustainable policies could have emissions 
attributed to year-over-year land use for the 20-year 
period of the amortization (see sidebar “Retailers’ 
measurement, accounting, and reporting challenges”).

Retailers’ measurement, accounting, and reporting challenges

Beyond previously detailed challenges—such as fragmented supply chains with numerous SKUs and lack of 
accurate data on consumer use (energy consumption, for example)—and upstream supplier data challenges, 
such as technical know-how and resource constraints, retailers face some challenges in Scope 3 emissions 
measurement, accounting, and reporting. 

Measurement

 — Variability. Variability can occur over time, which can present challenges to quantifying and accounting 
for emissions. Certain seasonal events, such as low harvest yields or drought, can alter the carbon 
emission intensity of land use as well as of some inputs used in production. Additionally, diversifying a 
supplier base to build supply chain resilience can result in changes in emissions. Changes to methods 
and locations of production and changes in transportation can also create variations. 

 — Inconsistent data format and measurement standards. Where data is collected, the units often vary and 
consensus is lacking on the emissions impacts of certain decarbonization efforts (for example, carbon 
sequestration in soil). For instance, data inputs can vary because they are based on different emission 
factors, primary versus secondary data, and global warming potentials (GWPs). Allocation methods 
can be physical or economic, for example. Cutoffs and boundaries can vary when functional units are 
defined differently. And finally, the type of data can vary based on the calculation method, which could, 
for example, be spend-based, activity data–based, site-specific, fuel-specific, asset-specific, or waste-
type-specific.

60

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chains 
Accounting 

 — Disconnect between industry averages and project impacts. While emissions factors and other 

simplifying assumptions based on industry averages make it possible for retailers to estimate their 
total Scope 3 footprint without measuring the individual footprint of hundreds of millions of items, such 
estimations typically do not reflect the impact of specific decarbonization projects in a retailer’s product 
supply chain or items. Accounting for the impact of decarbonization projects is not possible using 
secondary emission factors from third-party lifecycle inventory (LCI) databases.  

Additionally, retailers cannot extrapolate measurements from specific projects to estimate their total 
emissions because of significant variation across items and product supply chains. While companies 
and service providers are experimenting with hybrid methodologies that mix actual data and industry 
averages, such approaches rely on additional assumptions that may make it more difficult for 
accounting controls, assurance, or comparability across companies.

 — Changes in baselines. From time to time, shifts in scopes and publicly available emissions factors affect 
historical estimates, requiring companies to revise and restate baseline data. Such shifts in the baseline 
create uncertainty for target setting and management. When there is an acquisition or a session of a 
business unit, it is often difficult to integrate the new business unit with the same data precision. For 
climate change, for example, the baseline year must be recalculated using data for the new business 
unit—data that often is not available and must be estimated.

 — Changes in greenhouse gas accounting methodology. As the science and data evolve, standard 

setters update carbon accounting methodologies. For example, the GHG Protocol is undertaking a 
revision of guidance to measure emissions from food and land use (FLAG protocols).1 Open questions 
about accounting methodologies can create uncertainty for companies and make it difficult for them to 
set performance targets, especially publicly.

 — Lagging emissions factors. For many retailers, Scope 3 emissions are generated by energy grids and 
land use around the world and are estimated using emissions factors that are updated at different 
times, based on different standards; these factors tend to lag behind actual changes in energy grids 
and agricultural systems. 

Reporting 

 — Incorporating decarbonization efforts in estimated totals. There is currently no consistent 

methodology for adjusting industry averages to account for portions of a retailer’s supply chain that 
may differ due to particular decarbonization efforts.

 — Limited influence. Given the nature of retail Scope 3 emissions, year-over-year emissions reductions will 
largely be driven by the greening of electricity grids and widespread adoption of regenerative agriculture 
practices. Other major factors, such as emissions related to deforestation, are based on historical industry 
averages that will not change significantly year over year. These factors are largely beyond a retailer’s 
realm of influence. Retailers can separately report the results of actual initiatives in their value chains, but 
it is not possible to reconcile or reflect these results in the modeled aggregate numbers.

 — Internal data quality. Unlike with financial data, retailers do not manage data internally on the physical 

properties of the products they carry. It can be difficult to access comprehensive and reliable databases 
to obtain this information. Obtaining quality databases on product properties—such as product weight, 
raw materials’ points of origin and weights, and the weight and composition of product packaging—
requires significant investments in retailers’ IT tools and shared databases with suppliers. And while

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chains 
retailers must report product-level metrics to differentiate themselves, such granular information may 
not be available and retailers may fear disclosing competitively sensitive information.

 — Headwinds from business growth. Because its overall emissions footprint could expand, a company 
that is significantly reducing emissions per unit but growing market share (and its emissions footprint) 
could appear to be performing worse on emissions than a company that is not reducing emissions but 
is also not growing. Similarly, the impact of replacing carbon-intensive products with carbon-efficient 
products is not reflected in GHG inventory accounting; in the absence of a standardized way to account 
for these product-level nuances, companies have difficulty reporting on them. 

Despite these challenges, retailers are managing such 
complexity via a number of initiatives, outlined as follows.

Supporting efforts to improve data
Retailers are working with others to improve the 
quality and availability of data and the applicability 
of accounting and reporting standards. For example, 
many retailers are engaging their suppliers in projects 
to pilot and scale new measurement approaches.

Using order-of-magnitude estimations for  
Scope 3 footprint reporting 
By referring to widely adopted and authoritative 
standards such as the GHG Protocol for consistency 
and comparability in reporting the Scope 3 footprint 
while taking advantage of simplifying methodologies 
such as spend-based method to facilitate modeling of 
Scope 3 footprint where data is not available, retailers 
can provide order-of-magnitude estimations of 
Scope 3 footprint. These estimations are sufficient to 
highlight major concentrations of emissions and inform 
priorities for decarbonization.

Providing supplemental information to demonstrate  
impact of decarbonization efforts
Reporting supplementary information can help 
stakeholders understand retailers’ Scope 3 
decarbonization strategy and contribution and role in 
Scope 3 emissions reduction, especially because the 
total Scope 3 footprint will not necessarily show year-
over-year progress if estimated using industry averages. 
For example, retailers are reporting percentage of 
suppliers engaged in decarbonization, reductions in 
emissions intensity overall or for key categories, results 
of particular decarbonization projects that illustrate 
changes to methods of production that could be 
scaled across supply chains, and the assortment mix 
(percentage of items certified as energy efficient or 
deforestation- or conversion-free).

Improving practicality of measurement,  
accounting, and reporting
Engaging with carbon accounting standards bodies 
(such as the GHG Protocol), reporting platforms 
(such as CDP), and regulators can help address the 
previously noted challenges regarding measurement, 
accounting, and reporting.

Considerations for retailers: 
Engaging with the public sector
On many fronts, reductions in retailers’ Scope 3 
emissions are subject to public sector–led initiatives 
regarding energy and land-use systems. Therefore, 
retailers would be well served by a deep understanding 
of existing and proposed standards and guidelines. 
Retailers can determine whether or how public guidelines 
related to emissions affect their business outlook and 
the effectiveness of their efforts to decarbonize their 
value chains. Retailers can also help to create change 
by advocating for national and international climate 
policies that address the interests of stakeholders in their 
businesses, value chains, and customer communities.

Decarbonizing retailers’ value chains is feasible—but 
it cannot be done in isolation. At-scale deployment 
of the sustainability measures outlined in this report 
will require system-level change involving retailers, 
farmers and ranchers, manufacturers, suppliers, 
NGOs, public sector actors, energy companies, 
financial institutions, data and technology providers, 
and consumers. Coordinated multistakeholder action 
is imperative to realize the goals of the retail sector and 
contribute to the ambitious but essential overarching 
objective: a net-zero planet.

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsAppendix

Exhibit 2: Methodology and assumptions
High-level methodology is CDP compliant and 
includes data accuracy measures to select reliable 
data points.

Data collection
 — An initial data set of 1,000 global retailers was 

evaluated.

 — A final data set of 85 global retailers was used for 

the report analysis.

•  The data was divided into four broad retail 
categories—consumer staples, consumer 
discretionary, restaurants, and apparel—to show 
category-specific retailer emissions.

•  Category-specific data was further divided 
into 13 subcategories (product categories): 
apparel; apparel, accessories, and luxury goods; 
automotive; broadline; computer and electronics; 
consumer staples; drugs; food; footwear; home 
furnishings; home improvement; other specialty; 
and restaurants.

•  Data for the top ten global retailers by revenue 

was also categorized.

Assumptions
 — Scope 3 emissions data was included if the 
retailer’s reported Scope 3 GHG emissions 
exceeded at least 95 percent of its total (Scope 1, 2, 
and 3 combined) GHG emissions, implying credible 
Scope 3 data since the majority of retailers’  
Scope 3 emissions come from their supply chain.113

 — In instances in which a Scope 3 upstream and 

downstream emissions split for a company was not 
available, we used theoretical proxies based on 
averages for similar company type.

Calculations
 — GHG emissions were calculated using the following 

CDP approved methodology: estimated total 
emissions of global retailers = (average GHG 
emissions per $ revenue) x (total revenue of top 
1,000 global retailers).

Chapter 3: Examples of emissions reduction  
opportunities, organized by theme
Examples in this appendix supplement those provided 
in Chapter 3. They illustrate potential emissions 
reduction opportunities, organized within the seven 
decarbonization themes and the types of resources 
involved: economic resources, natural and physical 
resources, human resources, low-carbon technology, 
and data transparency.

Transitioning to clean and renewable energy

Economic resources examples 
 — It could cost $490 per metric ton of CO2 abated to 
electrify an electronics components manufacturer 
with an annual output of about 13 million wafers.114

 — It could cost $518 per metric ton of CO2 abated to 
electrify a garment manufacturer with an annual 
output of about 40 million meters of fabric. 

 — It could require could require $4 trillion invested 
annually in clean energy by 2030 to hit 2050 net-
zero targets.115

Natural and physical resource examples
 — In the next few decades it could require twice 

the power generation capacity from renewables 
available in November 2023 to support potential 
mill decarbonization targets in India, where most 
textile mills are located.116

113   Scope 3 emissions account for 90 percent, and sometimes up to 98 percent of retailers’ greenhouse gas emissions. See Ben Unglesbee, “‘We have 

to do something’: Can retail close the gap on supply chain emissions?,” Retail Dive, July 18, 2022.

114   Unless otherwise indicated, sources for figures in this appendix are derived from McKinsey analysis conducted in December 2023.

116   “Sector: Renewable energy,” accessed June 27, 2024.

63

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chains — It could require 50 gigawatts of renewable-energy 
capacity developed annually in India, including 
establishing wind power capacity of at least ten 
gigawatts per year, to achieve 500 gigawatts in 
power generation capacity by 2030.117

Human resources examples 
 — To meet the projected demand for 27 million job 
gains by 2050, training and skill development 
on efficiency breeding, adaptive grazing, and 
precision technologies would be needed.123

Human resources examples 
 — About nine million direct jobs could be gained in EV 
manufacturing and new jobs created in the mobility 
ecosystem (such as in smart charging) by 2050.118 

 — Of note, 90 percent of offshore oil and gas workers 
have skills that are highly transferable for offshore 
wind farms and the capacity for retraining in other 
forms of renewable energy.119

Low-carbon technology examples
 — To align with a 1.5° pathway, by 2030 the 

development, integration, and utilization of clean 
and renewable energy would need to increase ten- 
to 15-fold for technologies in early adoption stages 
such as geothermal energy and advanced fuels 
and 300 times for renewable hydrogen. 

 — By 2030, the cost to produce emerging clean and 
renewable technologies such as green hydrogen 
may fall from $5.00–$7.00 per kilogram to $2.00–
$2.60 per kilogram for projects with on-site 
generation, and the cost of mature technologies 
such as solar panels and wind turbines could fall by 
40 percent and 27 percent, respectively.120

Reducing farming emissions from livestock  
management

Natural and physical resources examples 
 — To yield the same amount of beef annually, a 

fertilized irrigated pasture system would require the 
same amount of land as used in feedlot systems.121

 — A semi-intensive silvopastoral system could 

require four times less land than a feedlot system 
to yield the same volume of beef annually.122

Low-carbon technology examples 
 — To align with a 1.5° pathway, by 2030 the adoption 
of technologies such as selective breeding, fat 
supplements in feed mix, red algae, animal health 
monitoring systems, and adaptive grazing may need 
be four to seven times higher than adoption rates as 
of December 2023.124 Adoption of technologies such 
as adaptive grazing and animal health monitoring 
systems ranges from 40 percent to 69 percent, per 
a November 2022 USDA study.125

Data transparency examples
 — Primary data could allow retailers to track 

reductions in their Scope 3 emissions at the farm 
level; such data could also be used to provide 
incentives for farmers to employ sustainable-
farming policies. Farms could then be tracked 
using GPS polygon mapping to ensure compliance.

Adopting regenerative practices in plant-based 
agricultural inputs

Economic resources examples
 — For an animal feed grower in the United States with 
four to five metric tons of annual grain production 
per acre and 2,000 to 2,400 acres of land, adopting 
regenerative practices could generate a cost savings 
of more than $200 per metric ton of CO2 abated.

 — For a cotton grower in Asia with 1.5 hectares of 
land holdings and an annual production of 445 
kilograms of lint per hectare, adopting regenerative 
practices could generate cost savings of about 
$180 per metric ton of CO2 abated.126

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsNatural and physical resources examples
 — Efficient management of crop land—such as 
reducing the overfertilization of crops in the 
United States by threefold—can maximize the 
effectiveness of decarbonizing solutions like 
nitrification inhibitors, and reducing application of 
fertilizers can reduce global emissions by around 
131 million metric tons of CO2 by 2050.127

Low-carbon technology examples
 — Increased adoption of low-carbon technology 
such as sprinkler irrigation and regenerative 
silvopasture on small-scale farms could reduce 
emissions considerably.128 For example:

•  According to McKinsey analysis, replacement of 
flood irrigation with emerging technologies such 
as sprinkler irrigation—100 percent adoption in 
high-income countries and 75 percent adoption 
in low- and medium-income countries—could 
reduce emissions by around 85 million metric 
tons of CO2 by 2050.

•  If global adoption of silvopasture increased by 

2050 to 720.55 million to 772.25 million hectares 
from an estimated 550.00 million hectares, the 
result could be an annual emissions reduction of 
0.55 to 1.07 gigatons of CO2.129

Increasing circularity of products and packaging 

Economic resources examples
 — Reducing CO2 emissions in electronics production 

and packaging via take-back schemes for 
PCBAs, recycled batteries, and more could 
cost around $264 per metric ton of CO2 abated, 
while substituting magnesium for aluminum in 
electronics manufacturing could save around  
$50 per metric ton of CO2 abated.

Natural and physical resources examples
 — Improved recycling technology is needed to ensure 
plastics and metals are recycled into higher-value 
applications to achieve net-zero targets in 2030 
and 2050.

Human resources examples 
 — A workforce skilled in deploying large-scale 

infrastructure would be needed to support at-scale 
increases in recycling and reuse.130

 — In addition to other efforts to influence changes in 
consumer behaviors, to align with a 1.5° pathway 
by 2030, one of every five garments produced 
worldwide would need to be traded through a circular 
business model.

 — Streamlining logistics around waste collection and 
transportation costs to facilitate ease of access 
to recycling could increase recycling rates—for 
example, addressing reasons that consumers 
typically do not recycle items purchased from a 
specific brand at that brand’s recycling centers.

Low-carbon technology examples
 — Large-scale production and adoption of low-

carbon technology and materials such as recycled 
cotton fibers, recycled PET, and recycled 
cardboard in packaging, along with circular 
business models such as take-back schemes 
for PCBAs, could enable substantial emissions 
reductions.

 — To remain on a 1.5° pathway and achieve a 5 to 

15 percent reduction in total Scope 3 emissions 
for the average retailer, by 2030 developing 
technologies such as recycled PET would need 
to achieve 100 percent adoption (as of 2022, the 
adoption rate was 38 percent in North America), 
and the use of recycled cardboard in packaging 
would need to increase four to seven times over 
2023 rates.131

Reducing waste and increasing process efficiency

Economic resources examples
 — Adopting yield improvement in battery manufacturing 
in the electronics value chain for a typical battery 
manufacturer production output of 100 gigawatt-
hours could save around $260 per metric ton of  
CO2 abated.132

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chains — Using low-liquor dyeing machines and redesigning 

equipment for efficiency for a garment manufacturer 
in the apparel value chain in Asia could save around 
$364 per metric ton of CO2 abated.

Natural and physical resources examples
 — Reductions in post-consumption waste could 
be achieved by adopting compostable product 
packaging made with biodegradable materials 
such as cellulose, wood, sugarcane, bamboo, 
mushroom, and seaweed, and plant-based 
packaging made from corn, maize, bagasse, and 
organic cotton. It is important to note that this 
material shift can fail to deliver impact (particularly 
for consumer packaging uses) in communities in 
which composting infrastructure has not scaled.

Human resources examples
 — New initiatives and campaigns to influence 

customers and engender substantial changes 
in traditional human behaviors could increase 
emissions reduction potential considerably: in a 
model aligned with a 1.5° pathway, for example, 
21 percent of the emissions reduction potential in 
fashion is tied to changes in consumer actions.133

 — A 40 percent improvement in waste collection in the 
fashion value chain could be achieved with better 
training and incentives for factory employees—one 
of many efforts in the fashion industry needed to 
reduce emissions 50 percent by 2030.134

Low-carbon technology
 — To help optimize farm and production processes 
and reduce waste, investment and development 
are needed for advanced technology and tools, 
including emerging technologies such as the 
Internet of Things (IoT) and smart sensors to 
monitor soil health, analyze moisture, detect 
water contamination, and determine water 
quantity levels, as well as smart recycling systems 
(distributed broadly) for consumers to recycle 
everyday plastics such as bottles and cans.135

Data transparency 
Granular data and end-to-end traceability on sources 
of waste generated along the value chain can help 
identify opportunities to reduce waste. Sources could 
include waste from inefficient production processes, 
damage from operations and transportation, and 
postconsumer waste from spoilage and disposal. 

Reducing emissions in transportation

Economic resources examples
 — Electrifying transport in the beef, electronics, and 
apparel value chains could cost around $111 per 
metric ton of CO2 abated but would help achieve 
2030 net-zero targets.136 

Natural and physical resources examples
 — By 2035, the largest auto markets would need to be 
fully focused on EV sales, and adoption of advanced 
fuels would need to be ten to 15 times higher to meet 
demand if EVs accounted for 75 percent of new 
passenger car sales globally by 2030.137

 — By 2030, a 4,000 percent increase in the use of 

lithium and graphite in manufacturing EV batteries 
could be needed to meet demand for EVs and a 175 
percent increase in the supply of other rare earth 
elements could be needed to meet manufacturing 
demands for wind turbine production.138

Human resources examples
 — Drivers, operators, and others would need to be 
upskilled and trained to support large-scale EV 
deployment, operation, and maintenance.

Low-carbon technology examples
 — According to the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, 

increasing sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) 
and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) from the 
current 5 percent of new car sales to almost 100 
percent of sales by 2050 could cut CO2 emissions 
from vehicles by around half.139

Retailers’ climate road map: Charting paths to decarbonized value chainsData transparency examples
 — The use of digital technologies such as the IoT, 

which does not require fertilizer, fresh water, or 
arable land, could reduce emissions from farming.144

imaging, cloud-based computing, geolocation, and 
AI to gather and analyze real-time data to improve 
decision making and route optimization could 
reduce global emissions 5 percent by 2050.140

Transitioning from animal protein to plant  
protein products 

Economic resources examples 
 — Shifting from producing animal-based proteins 

such as beef to plant-based proteins such as pea 
protein could cost around $36 per metric ton of 
CO2 abated. By 2030, alternative proteins are 
expected to be ubiquitous, offered as menu options 
in fast-food and fine-dining establishments.141

 — In livestock feed diets, using red seaweed, which 
suppresses methanogenesis and reduces the 
amount of methane cattle emit, could cost $99 per 
metric ton of CO2 abated.

Natural and physical resources examples
 — Shifting cultivation of cropland to grow peas, 

beans, lentils, and soy can help meet demand for 
plant-based protein products.

 — According to McKinsey analysis, shifting half the 
global protein market share to alternative protein 
and the associated innovations in infrastructure, 
cost reductions, and increased yields and  
demands could mitigate five metric gigatons of  
CO2 emissions annually by 2050.142

 — A global shift in protein consumption—swapping 
beef and dairy-based protein for poultry, eggs, 
fish, and plant-based proteins—could reduce 
agricultural land use by 75 percent.143

 — Replacing dry matter consisting of corn and 
soymeal cultivated using traditional land-use 
practices with additives such as red seaweed, 

Human resources examples
 — Consumer awareness, education, and behavioral 
changes would need to be realized on a global 
scale to ensure scale-up in demand for and 
adoption of alternative protein products.

 — Standards and guidelines to list the carbon intensity 

of food on product labels could help increase 
demand via increasing consumer awareness of the 
origins and impacts of the foods in their diets and 
influencing consumer behavior changes.145 

Low-carbon technology examples
 — New breeding technologies require investments 
to support the development of next-gen plant-
based protein product traits and technology and 
to fast-track technological advances and at-scale 
deployment.146 

Data transparency examples
 — Data on consumers’ sentiments about plant-based 
protein—such as willingness to pay and concerns 
about safety, health, taste, and quality—is needed 
to facilitate the shift from animal to plant protein. 
This data could inform product developments 
to improve the texture and mouthfeel of plant 
proteins and ensure that the nutritional content 
meets consumers’ expectations for providing the 
amount of protein and other nutrients they equate 
with animal protein.

 — Open-access databases that provide links 

between plant protein structure and function could 
provide farmers with comprehensive data on 
the characteristics and function of proteins 
from various crops and support an overall 
understanding of how these parameters are 
affected by growing conditions and extraction.147
