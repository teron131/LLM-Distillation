Fulfilling the potential 
of US higher education

Postsecondary education leads to better jobs, greater economic 
mobility, and more. Can higher ed institutions extend that promise to 
millions more people?

Saurabh Sanghvi, and Doug Scott, representing views from McKinsey’s Education Practice.

The US higher education system faces crises on 
multiple fronts. Enrollment growth is slowing, 
student debt is at an all-time high, the sector is not 
delivering on its promise of greater equity, and its 
reputation is declining in the opinion of many 
Americans. We believe there is a challenging but 
clear solution. Higher ed must remain focused on its 
core mission of educating learners but evolve its 
practices to expand services to more Americans. 
Our analysis suggests that the sector should aspire 
to a bold goal: graduate ten million more students 
than currently projected over the next 20 years. 
This goal is ambitious, but the data show there is a 
pathway to achieving it in a way that successfully 
addresses the sector’s challenges rather than 
exacerbating them. 

Higher education in the United States remains a 
powerful enabler of economic mobility and 
individual empowerment. The sector consists of 
more than 6,400 institutions, which annually  
serve 16 million undergraduate students and award 
three million bachelor’s and associate’s degrees.1 

Postsecondary education leads to better employ-
ment outcomes, greater socioeconomic mobility, and 
nonmonetary benefits including improved health 
and increased civic engagement.2 How might 
institutions extend that promise to millions more 
people over the next two decades? 

The US higher education system is facing increased 
scrutiny. College costs are at an all-time high,  
and Americans collectively owe an unprecedented 
$1.7 trillion in student loans as of August 2022.3  
At the same time, public confidence in the value of  
a college education is declining. Only half of 
Americans say the economic benefits of a college 
degree outweigh the costs, according to a 2022 
survey from the nonpartisan research organization 
Public Agenda.4 Nearly two in five college graduates 
regret their major.5 In a recent survey from the  
think tank New America, only 36 percent of Gen 
Zers (born after 1996) and 45 percent of millennials 
(born 1981 to 1996) agree that a high-quality  
higher education is affordable. Just 37 percent of 
Americans think higher education is fine as it is.6 

Postsecondary education leads to  
better employment outcomes, greater 
socioeconomic mobility, and 
nonmonetary benefits including 
improved health and increased  
civic engagement.

Fulfilling the potential of US higher educationNegative perceptions are not the only trends the 
sector must confront. Following a slow decline in 
birth rates, the total number of high school graduates 
pursuing postsecondary studies is projected to 
drop by 11 to 15 percent between 2025 and 2029.7 
And many higher-education institutions continue  
to fall short in delivering equitable outcomes—
particularly for underrepresented populations—and 
have not sufficiently reckoned with the pervasive 
racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequities on  
their campuses.

The US higher education sector is endeavoring  
to address value and equity challenges. And 
thousands of faculty members, counselors, staff, 
and administrators work tirelessly to help their 
students succeed. But the nation may need a faster, 
more fundamental transformation to substantially 
change the sector’s trajectory. The US economy  
is facing national skills shortages that pose risks to 
national security, public health, and economic 
competitive ness. Last year alone, 375,000 cyber-
security jobs and 202,000 nursing jobs went unfilled.8 
And demand for skilled labor is expected to grow.9

How can US higher education overcome these 
challenges? Currently, 52.5 million US adults 
between 18 and 54—the age range during which the 
median return on investment for a postsecondary 
degree is positive10—have just a high school diploma 
or GED and are earning less than the median income 
of those in their communities with college degrees.11 
This population is largely over 25 years old, with a 
higher percentage of Black and Hispanic adults 
than the general population. While college may not 
be the right answer for everyone, getting more of 
these potential learners to a postsecondary degree 
could have a major impact on improving lives, 
reducing equity gaps, and filling the nation’s skills 
shortages. Our analysis suggests that the sector 

could support ten million more graduates over the 
next 20 years and, in so doing, lift 2.2 million 
Americans and their households out of poverty, 
increase lifetime GDP by $16 trillion (nearly  
$2 million per graduate),12 and close the racial 
attainment gap by 31 percent. 

Achieving this ambitious goal would require signifi-
cant changes. Many institutions would need to 
increase affordability, expand access, and provide 
more and better student support to ensure 
completion and postgraduation success. Not taking 
these actions would only worsen the deep chal-
lenges facing the sector. However, by deploying 
proven interventions, institutions can support more 
individuals on their collegiate journeys and prepare 
them for better jobs, higher earnings, and greater 
societal engagement. In doing so, they could also 
begin to mitigate the impact of the anticipated 
demographic cliff and increase equity and inclusion. 

In this report, we explore higher education’s 
opportunity to serve more students and become an 
even more powerful force for equity and inclusion. 
We also outline the realistic potential for expanding 
access to higher education, what it could take to 
meet the needs of the millions more students who 
might benefit from earning degrees, and how it 
could affect both prospective students and society. 
Finally, we outline some key actions institutions 
should consider in order to launch this effort. 

The broad benefits of higher education 
The data are clear: a postsecondary education in 
the United States is a catalyst for great opportunity. 
Graduates gain valuable technical and socio-
emotional skills that enable them to have better 
employment outcomes, higher lifetime earnings,  
and a greater likelihood of getting and keeping a

economic mobility, dramatically increasing the 
likelihood of jumping from a low-income household 
into the top 20 percent of income earners.14 And  
it corresponds to noneconomic benefits in health 

and civic engagement; those with at least  
a bachelor’s degree are more likely to exercise, 
volunteer, vote, and engage their children in 
educational activities than those with only a high 
school diploma or equivalent (Exhibit 1).15

Fulfilling the potential of US higher educationIncreasing the number of graduates by ten million 
over the next two decades could enable an 
additional 4.3 million people from underrepresented 
populations to obtain postsecondary degrees, 
closing 31 percent of the attainment gap. It could also 
lift 2.2 million Americans out of poverty, which 
would have a cascading impact on their households, 
descendants, and local communities.16

At the college and university level, institutions would 
benefit from a student population that’s more 
diverse in race, age, and socioeconomic status. The 
benefits to society could also be significant.17 
Greater degree attainment and increased earnings 
have compounding effects on the economy, and  
ten million extra graduates could add $16 trillion in 
lifetime GDP to the economy, with each individual 
with a bachelor’s degree contributing an average of 
$800,000 in additional direct government  
revenue. These graduates could also lead to  
1.6 million newly employed over the next  
20 years—a half-percentage-point increase in  
labor force participation—helping to fill critical  
labor shortages in high-growth fields.18

A call to boost equity and inclusion
Many Americans miss out on the benefits of a 
college education simply through the circumstances 
of their birth. Hispanic, Native American, and Black 
Americans have the lowest rates of educational 
attainment; only 21, 24, and 29 percent, respectively, 
have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared with 
44 percent of non-Hispanic Whites and 61 percent 
of Asian Americans.19 Existing equity gaps not  
only in race and ethnicity but also in income level, 
able-bodiedness, gender and sexual orientation, 
and other demographic traits suggest the country  
is leaving a wealth of potential untapped.20 
Addressing these challenges will require decisive 
action. K–12 educators, employers, funders,  
policy makers, and colleges will need to collaborate 
to ensure that anyone who wishes to pursue a 
postsecondary degree can enroll and succeed.

Racial and ethnic equity gaps are among the most 
pervasive in postsecondary education. McKinsey 
research has shown that only 44 percent of not-for-
profit institutions have representative student 
populations (see sidebar “Toward a more equitable

take seven decades to achieve fully representative 
incoming student populations. Moreover, only  
39 percent of Native American students, 40 percent 
of Black students, and 54 percent of Hispanic 
students who enroll in college earn their bachelor’s 
degree within six years, compared with 64 percent 
of White and 74 percent of Asian students  
(Exhibit 2).22

Colleges and universities also need to navigate 
various socioeconomic, regional, and political 
factors to maintain their reputation as the bridge to 
middle-class prosperity. Geographical gaps in 

postsecondary educational attainment are striking, 
with the largest concentrations of degree 
attainment in metropolitan and affluent areas.23 
Many states have education deserts, where 
residents live far from colleges and universities.24 
Other low-income and rural Americans cannot 
access online learning opportunities because high-
speed internet access has not yet come to their 
areas or they cannot afford it25—a digital divide 
highlighted during the pandemic. Expanding higher 
education access to residents of geographies  
with struggling economies may be a pivotal 
component to combating job displacement and 
spurring greater innovation.

Fulfilling the potential of US higher educationToward a more equitable future

McKinsey’s Education Practice, in 
collaboration with its Institute for Black 
Economic Mobility, recently released 
Racial and ethnic equity in US higher 
education.1 The report’s research high-
lights the importance of racial and ethnic 
equity in higher ed, noting that nearly  
84 percent of university presidents agree 
that racial equity has become more 
important for their institutions. However, 
the report also quantifies the slow 
progress to date and the large gaps that 
persist. Our analysis suggests that few 
institutions are exceeding expectations  
of access and completion for students 
from underrepresented populations; only  

8 percent of institutions have at least 
equitable student representation and 
graduate underrepresented students at 
the same rate as the general US undergrad-
uate population. And progress is slow— 
just 6 percent of not-for-profit institutions 
improved on having a more diverse student 
population than expected between  
2013 and 2020. Improving accessibility by 
increasing the share of students from 
underrepresented populations in the 
student body and helping these students 
to graduate on time would help the sector 
realize its promise of economic mobility 
and improved life outcomes for all.

Minority-serving institutions offer examples. 
While less than 10 percent of institutions 
exceeded average completion rates for 
students from underrepresented popula-
tions, 40 percent of those that did were 
minority-serving institutions including 
historically Black colleges and universities, 
Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal 
colleges and universities. Two-thirds of the 
institutions that exceeded expectations  
for student and faculty representation were 
also minority-serving institutions, many  
of which are significantly underresourced.

With the total number of US high school graduates 
declining and more than 35 percent of college 
students 26 or older,26 higher education could also 
turn its attention to older adults, who often need 
different support structures, tailored instructional 
modalities, and affordable financing pathways that 
will require sectorwide innovation. 

On the edge of a demographic cliff 
Today, only four in ten Americans 25 or older have 
bachelor’s degrees. While the proportion of college 
graduates has increased over the past decade, this 
trend is not likely to continue in the future.27

COVID-19.29 From the fall of 2019 to the fall of 2021, 
undergraduate enrollment declined by 6.6 percent, 
or 1.2 million students. As the pandemic progressed, 
students increasingly began to doubt the value  
of a college education: in May 2021, 65 percent of 
students surveyed agreed that higher education  
is no longer worth the cost, up from 57 percent in 
December 2020 and 49 percent in August 2020, 
partly because they said the quality of online 
instruction was not as good as in person.30 So the 
pandemic and its fallout only exacerbated the 
effects of the demographic cliff that higher educa-
tion leaders have long been anticipating. 

Starting in 2025, college enrollment may drop by  
as much as 15 percent, a decline driven primarily by 
reduced birth rates that began during the 2008 
recession and have only recently started to recover.28 
Over the past two years, enrollment rates have 
already begun slowing down, largely because of 

The economic competitiveness 
imperative
This decline in college enrollment is coming just as 
the nation is facing an increase in the number  
of jobs requiring critical skills that need to be filled 
across industries. And though employers are

Fulfilling the potential of US higher educationbeginning to shift to skills-based hiring methods 
that focus less on applicants’ academic credentials,31 
these trajectories need not conflict. Institutions  
can partner with employers to ensure curriculums 
align with future workforce needs, supporting  
the shift to skills-based hiring (see sidebar “College 
or bust?”).32 Ultimately, higher education’s most 

important role is to provide students with the 
valuable technical and interpersonal work skills 
nearly all employers desire. 

Our analysis indicates that 86 percent of new jobs 
created through 2030 will require postsecondary 
education.33 Job growth is projected to be highest in 

College or bust?

The impact that expanding higher 
education could have on individual lives 
and society is significant. But it’s important 
to note that college may not be the right 
path for everyone. Whether to pursue 
post secondary education is a personal 
choice, and 45 percent of Americans  
say they believe they need only a high 
school diploma, GED, or technical 
certificate to ensure financial security.1

Many organizations have analyzed the 
population of adults without a college 
degree and the opportunities to improve 
their economic mobility without obtaining  
a bachelor’s degree. One of these 
orga ni zations’ core recommendations is to 
take advantage of the talents of workers 
who have decided to forgo higher education. 
Employers could consider skills-based 
hiring practices rather than overrelying on 
credentials.2 A systematic change in this 

direction is already under way; the Burning 
Glass Institute, which advances data-
driven research on the future of work and 
workers, notes that some employers are 
eliminating degree requirements in many 
medium-skill and some higher-skill roles, 
and predicts that over the next five years, 
1.4 million additional jobs will become 
available to candidates without college 
degrees.3 Almost 50 national organizations, 
including McKinsey, have signed a pledge 
to “tear the paper ceiling” by recognizing 
the untapped potential of workers without  
a college degree.4

In 2020, McKinsey joined the Rework 
America Alliance,5 a coalition of 
organizations focused on helping millions 
of workers build successful careers  
in today’s digital economy regardless of 
formal education. Together with public-, 
private-, and social-sector institutions, 

including the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta, Google, the NAACP, and Walmart, 
we helped design scalable capabilities  
to allow unemployed workers to identify 
credible job trajectories and reskilling 
opportunities. Our initial analysis suggests 
that these trajectories will be relevant  
to many of the Americans who are 
currently unemployed, allowing them to 
meaningfully improve their career 
outcomes without returning to school.

Certificates and technical education are 
options, too. Certificate programs, which 
are the fastest-growing portion of the 
higher education sector, on average lead 
to 20 percent higher earnings than a  
high school diploma.6 Apprenticeships and 
bootcamps on technical skills such  
as coding are other options for gaining 
desirable job skills.

higher (see sidebar “Mapping postsecondary job 
growth”). Labor market experts project major  
talent deficits in critical fields by 2025, including 
200,000 unfilled positions in nursing, 250,000  
in primary and secondary teaching, and 375,000 in 
cybersecurity.34 Such a talent shortage represents  
a significant risk to the nation’s public health, 
education, security, and global competitiveness. 
Educating more people with the skills to fill  
these jobs could improve their employability and 
help the country thrive.

Empowering ten million more 
graduates in 20 years

54 have only a high school diploma or GED and are 
earning less than the median income of those in their

Fulfilling the potential of US higher educationMapping postsecondary job growth 

Graduating an additional ten million 
learners could go a long way toward 
meeting projected growth in job needs 
across the country. At the national level, 
the number of US jobs requiring a 
postsecondary education is expected to 
grow 12 percent from 2018 to 2028— 
four times faster than jobs requiring a high 

school diploma or less. More than  
85 percent of the nearly 15 million additional 
jobs will require a postsecondary educa-
tion.1 However, this growth is not evenly 
distributed across the nation. Almost half 
of it is expected to take place in the six 
states with the greatest projected increase: 
Texas, California, Florida, New York, 

Washington, and Arizona (exhibit). In some 
of these states, such as Texas, projected 
growth will significantly outstrip the existing 
supply of in-state college graduates, 
pointing to a need to either produce more 
in-state graduates or attract more 
graduates to the state.

Fulfilling the potential of US higher educationEstablishing a goal of ten million additional 
graduates from this group over the next 20 years 
may be seen as a moonshot for higher education. 
But if the sector can pull it off and enroll and 
matriculate these additional individuals, it could  
flip the projected 0.4 percent annual declines  
in enrollment through 2037 to nearly 3.0 percent 
annual growth.38 The demand exists: over the  
next decade, employers in nearly every state will 
face significant labor shortages.39 

Getting smarter about capacity  
and completion 
Graduating ten million additional students over the 
next 20 years is an ambitious goal, and some 
colleges and universities may question whether 
they can create the capacity to contribute 
meaningfully toward it. 

In 2021, 10.5 million full-time and 6.5 million  
part-time students were enrolled, part of a steady 
decline in enrollment rates that is expected to 
continue.40 Adding ten million graduates over the 
next 20 years would entail accommodating as  
many as 21 million students during a given year, or 
four million more than the current enrollee base. 

There is excess capacity in the system today. By 
evaluating each institution’s peak enrollment  
in the past ten years and comparing it with 2019 
enrollment, we estimated the number of additional 
students each institution could reasonably  
support in the near term without any interventions. 

Postsecondary degree-granting institutions have 
room for at least nine million more students than are 
currently enrolled. This is likely an underestimate. 
Shifts in the higher education landscape in recent 
years, such as decreased enrollment and outsize 
facility expansion and faculty hiring, have likely led 
to additional capacity that is not yet reflected in 
available data.41 

Online learning can be another powerful tool for 
increasing capacity, and postpandemic growth in 
this area appears promising.42 Online enrollment 
reached record levels in 2020,43 and 47 percent of 
Americans surveyed in 2022 agreed that the  
quality of online education is about the same as 
in-person instruction.44 Innovative schools are 
continuing to experiment with expanding scale. 
Arizona State University’s Thunderbird School of 
Global Management, for example, recently 
announced its goal to serve 100 million learners  
in more than 40 languages through online 
channels,45 while schools such as Western 
Governors University and Southern New Hampshire 
University continue to grow enrollment quickly.46 
However, expansion of online and hybrid learning 
will likely need to be combined with robust  
student support and community building to avoid 
outcomes that have left many online students with 
significant debt but no degrees.47

Completion is another challenge. How can  
we ensure that the ten million additional  
adults entering the higher education system 
actually graduate?

Fulfilling the potential of US higher educationOur analysis showed that completion rates— 
the percentage of students at an institution who 
earn a degree or credential within a given time 
frame—differ widely between top- and bottom-
quartile two- and four-year institutions (Exhibit 6). A 
49-percentage-point gap in six-year completion 
rates separates high- and low-performing four-year 
institutions, and a 47-percentage-point gap in 
three-year completion rates separates high- and 
low-performing two-year institutions. A significant 
portion of two-year students transfer to other  
two- or four-year institutions without completing  

a degree at their first school, which, along with other 
factors, deflates two-year completion rates. Some 
have argued that the traditional success metrics 
used by four-year colleges and universities, such as 
completion rate, fail to fully account for the multiple 
missions and diverse student bodies of community 
colleges.48 However, since there are currently no 
viable alternatives, community college completion 
rates still provide valuable insight on institution 
performance, especially when comparing colleges. 
Even when adjusting for institution peer group by

Fulfilling the potential of US higher educationdescribing institutional diversity in US higher ed—
the average gap in completion rates between  
high- and low-performing two-year and four-year 
institutions remains 30 percentage points.49 

than any other quartile of two- or four-year 
institutions. While this is promising, these top-
performing two-year institutions enroll only  
2 percent of the total student population. 

In addition, there is a strong negative correlation 
among four-year institutions between completion 
rate and the proportion of students who are eligible 
for Pell Grants. Pell Grants—need-based federal 
financial aid that typically needn’t be repaid—are 
essential to narrowing the postsecondary-degree 
attainment gap for low-income and under-
represented populations. Four-year institutions in 
the top 25 percent by completion rate have only  
half as many Pell Grant–eligible students as those 
in the bottom 25 percent. Interestingly, this trend 
does not extend to two-year institutions, where the 
top quartile performs better than more than  
75 percent of four-year institutions and maintains 
higher proportions of Pell Grant–eligible students 

The Carnegie Classifications have another anomaly: 
wide completion-rate gaps exist even when there is 
minimal difference in the share of Pell Grant–
eligible students between high- and low-performing 
institutions, suggesting that other factors are at 
play. Currently, 8.7 million students attend institutions 
with a variability in Pell Grant–eligible student 
shares of less than ten percentage points  
but a completion-rate difference of more than  
20 percentage points (Exhibit 7). 

These dire statistics show that the sector needs to 
radically rethink how it defines student success  
and support. The path forward is steep but clear: 
individual institutions have shown remarkable 
success at expanding access and making major 
improvements in completion rates. If others  
follow, these goals will be within reach.

Universities with the highest completion rates are 
well-resourced, predominantly White institutions 
that have historically accepted fewer low-income 
students and underrepresented minorities. But 
many institutions are challenging the status quo by 
demonstrating what is possible with more inclusive 
pathways. Some examples of schools that are  
in the top quartile of completion for their Carnegie 
Classification but have general acceptance rates 
above 50 percent include Dillard University, Eastern 
Florida State College, North Carolina Agricultural 
and Technical State University, and Pittsburgh 
Technical College. These institutions consistently 
produce college graduates without being highly 
selective or taking financial need into consideration. 
Another subset of schools that have demonstrated 
strong completion rates have begun focusing on 
expanding access; the University of California system 
recently announced it would add 33,000 students 
over the next eight years.50 In 2019, the University of 
Illinois Urbana–Champaign committed to providing

These schools and others illustrate what is possible 
and offer paths toward creating the type of  
systemic change required to enroll and graduate  
an additional ten million students over the next  
20 years. 

Before expanding access, institutions must 
prioritize completion strategies to increase 
graduation rates for their existing student bodies. 
Currently, institutions in the bottom two completion-
rate quartiles have 5.6 million open student 
positions, representing approximately 60 percent  
of available capacity (Exhibit 8). Improving 
completion rates at these institutions is imperative 
to creating a skilled and educated workforce. 

Significant improvements can be achieved. A 
literature review of completion initiatives deployed 
by a broad range of institutions found that the  
best interventions improved completion rates by up 
to ten percentage points. Assuming that each 
school could improve its completion rate by one 

percentage point every year on average, three-
quarters of schools would achieve the rates of 
today’s top-performing schools within 20 years.52 
That would boost average completion rates to  
80 percent for students pursuing bachelor’s 
degrees and 46 percent for students pursuing 
associate’s degrees—a major improvement. 
Focusing first on improving completion rates would 
substantially mitigate the potential debt burden 
accrued by students who do not graduate.

For institutions that already have high completion 
rates, expanding enrollment and the Pell Grant–
eligible student population could be the next 
priority. Historically, enrollment across the sector 
has grown 2.3 percent a year.53 If schools expand 
enrollment faster—by 2 to 3 percent a year—
together with improvements to their completion 
rates, they could create the capacity for ten million 
additional students to graduate over the next  
20 years. However, only 11 percent of current two- 
and four-year available capacity is at institutions 
with above-average performance on both 
completion rate and share of Pell Grant–eligible 
students. Expanding the Pell Grant population, 

Assuming that each school could 
improve its completion rate by  
one percentage point every year on 
average, three-quarters of schools  
would achieve the rates of today’s top-
performing schools within 20 years.

We’ve seen similar growth in the past. At the height 
of the expansion in higher education spurred by  
the post–World War II GI Bill, enrollment grew at  
5.6 percent annually. The sector saw 3.5 percent 
annual growth in capacity during the 1970s.  
The most recent prolonged period of growth was 
from 2000 to 2010, when enrollment grew  
3.2 percent annually.55 

Overcoming the barriers to access  
and completion
Producing ten million additional graduates would 
require making bold investments rather than 
incremental changes. The total cost would be 
roughly $1.2 trillion across all stakeholders, 
including students, federal and state governments, 
and philanthropic organizations and individuals  
(see sidebar “Calculating the investment and returns”). 
This number includes approximately $1 trillion for 
instructional and operational costs and an additional 
$200 billion for interventions to increase access 
and completion, such as childcare, books and 
supplies, and other student support services. Other 
costs may need to be considered, including 
opportunity costs from lost wages, unproductive 
debt from students who do not complete their 
degrees, and interest from student loans. Costs 
could be reduced if higher-education institutions 
increased affordability and reduced barriers  
to education, for example through online and hybrid 
programs and tuition-payment installment plans. 
Higher education funders will need to collaborate to 
help finance this effort and ensure that potential 
students both graduate and find gainful employment. 

Leaders in the sector could start by identifying 
high-priority populations and their barriers to 
access and completion, so that schools can invest 

specifically in interventions proven to make a 
difference for the types of students at their 
institutions. The literature suggests that learners 
face four types of barriers to access and completion: 
information accessibility, financial resources, 
mindset and preparedness, and support services 
and networks. Schools are deploying a wide range 
of levers to address these barriers.

A review of more than 100 evidence-based 
interventions in these categories demonstrates that 
schools have shown improvement across a wide 
variety of student populations, ranging from parents 
to underrepresented populations to low-income 
students. Many of these interventions are directly 
applicable to the adult learner population; others 
can help ensure that more traditional student 
populations do not become working adults with some 
college but no degree. These interventions include 
the following examples:

 — Affordability and financial resources. The 
affordability of applying for and attending 
college and the availability of wraparound and 
support services are of particular concern  
to many of the targeted student populations. 
Institutions need to continue to improve the 
affordability of programs and track projected 
salaries to ensure that the cost of education 
aligns with expected earnings to help graduates 
maintain a sustainable debt-to-income ratio.  
We have identified 18 interventions in this area 
that could have a significant impact on access 
and completion, even if they stop well short of 
providing free tuition. For example, several 
institutions, including a group of technical 
colleges in Wisconsin, have made small ad hoc 
grants averaging $900 to $1,000 to students 
in need. Nearly three-quarters of the recipients 
graduated or remained enrolled during the 
program’s pilot period.56 On an even smaller scale, 
commuter students at Rio Hondo College in  
Los Angeles who received a deeply discounted 
public transportation pass were 17 percent more

Fulfilling the potential of US higher educationCalculating the investment and returns

The benefits of adding ten million more 
graduates by 2042 are clear. But what 
would it take to get there? This population 
is harder to reach and requires different 
types of support than most current 
students, so the amount of new spending 
and activity is significant. Serving an 
additional ten million graduates over the 
next 20 years will require $1.2 trillion in 
added investment, although potential cost 
efficiencies and innovative financing 
models could reduce the total. Even if 
costs could not be reduced, analyses  
have shown that a postsecondary degree 
is, on average, well worth both the money 
(through increased lifetime income, 

reduced need for social services,  
lower healthcare spending, and so forth) 
and effort (because of greater community 
engagement, volunteer work, and  
civic engagement).1

The largest investment is in instructional 
and operational costs, which average 
$115,000 for a bachelor’s degree and 
$30,000 for an associate’s.2 These costs 
are the baseline for serving students,  
but given the unique nature of the target 
student population, additional investment 
may be needed. Graduating a higher 
percentage of adult learners, who have 
different needs than the traditional 

students schools are accustomed to 
enrolling, will require new initiatives in areas 
such as childcare and transportation. 

We compared the cost expenditures of 
top-performing and average schools by 
completion rate to quantify the difference 
in cost per student for student services, 
grants, financial aid, and other categories  
that affect student access and completion 
outside of formal instructional and 
administrative costs. Our analysis estimates 
an additional cost of $1,300 for each 
two-year student and $22,000 for each 
four-year student to implement access  
and completion interventions. These funds

mental health services, on-site childcare, and student 
activities and cultural events to build campus 
community and students’ sense of belonging.

Additional costs, such as opportunity costs from forgone 
wages, childcare and transportation, and student  
loan debt, must also be considered. Individuals who 
start a degree program but do not complete it  
will also accrue significant debt. These costs can be 
reduced as higher-education institutions move toward 
improving completion, increasing flexibility, and 
reducing barriers through online and hybrid programs 
and tuition installment plans.

Ensuring that most students earn a degree, in con junc-
tion with increasing access to affordable education, 
will accelerate economic mobility (exhibit). However, 

careful consideration is essential to ensure that 
potential students are not saddled with high debt they 
are unable to pay off. Providing supplemental 
resources such as college advisers, student loan and 
financial aid education, and career counseling can  
help guide students toward the degree programs and 
institutions most likely to lead to success. Additionally, 
bridging the gap between academic programs  
and postgraduate jobs—through experiential learning, 
career services, and job training programs—is an 
important step toward ensuring that students are 
gainfully employed after graduation. Together  
with interventions to improve access and completion, 
these initiatives will allow higher ed to graduate ten 
million new learners—with all the associated benefits 
to individuals, the economy, and society. 

likely to earn a credential and 27 percent  
more likely to earn an associate’s degree.57 

 — Information accessibility. We have identified  

14 interventions to improve access to 
information, ranging from helping students 
submit the Free Application for Federal  
Student Aid (FAFSA) to providing simplified 
curricular pathways and course advising. 
Ensuring that students graduate with successful 
careers and manageable debt also requires 
comprehensive and transparent financial literacy 
and career resources. Georgia State University 
recently implemented a data-driven initiative  
that allows students to visualize their future 
employment progression through data on 
professional degree programs, job titles, salary 
information, and alumni career outcomes.58 
Another approach to improving information 
accessibility and simplifying the path to 

graduation is the use of broad course tracks, 
also known as meta-majors or career clusters,  
for a group of related programs.59 New students 
choose a track and then take a wide array of 
classes within the track, allowing them to explore 
possible career options before they decide 
which major fits them best. 

 — Mindset and preparedness. Being prepared not 
just academically but also in terms of mindset  
is a key factor in successful student outcomes. 
Many first-generation, underrepresented-
minority, and low-income students may find the 
campus experience daunting and alienating. 
The University of Texas at Austin addresses this 
by delivering a 45-minute pre-orientation 
message about the “UT mindset” to all incoming 
students. In a controlled experiment, participation 
in the training halved the credit completion gap 
between low- and high-risk students.60

Fulfilling the potential of US higher education — Support services and networks. Academic, 
family, and social support systems; career 
support and mentoring; and inclusive 
environments make a difference. The City 
University of New York has piloted and 
expanded a comprehensive program of 
wraparound assistance, including academic, 
financial, and social tools, to support timely 
degree completion. To date, 70,000 students 
have gone through the program, seeing  
a 53 percent three-year graduation rate for 
associate’s degrees—more than double  
the 24 percent rate of their peers.61 The State  
of Mississippi has implemented the Complete 2 
Compete (C2C) program, which is designed  
to help adult learners with some college credits  
but no degree graduate from one of the state’s 
community colleges or public universities.  
C2C provides individual coaching, which 
research suggests is particularly valuable for 
adult learners and students from under-
represented minorities.62 Other institutions are 
adapting interventions to promote a sense of 
belonging and inclusivity on campus. A sense of 
belonging—the extent to which students feel 
included, accepted, and valued—is positively 
associated with completion, retention, and 
engagement, especially for underrepresented 
populations and women.63 A survey of more than 
1,000 students at 22 tribal community colleges 
found that grade point averages were positively 
correlated with perceptions of belonging and 
support for Indigenous culture.64 

These interventions vary in complexity, cost, and 
target population, but all have resulted in meaningful 
improvements to access and completion outcomes. 
In each Carnegie Classification, top-quartile 
graduation rates are 20 to 30 percentage points 
higher than bottom-quartile rates. Adopting  
best practices could boost completion rates  
across the country.

Actions to begin
Reaching ten million additional students in 20 years 
will require significant investment and action  
across the interventions described above. How  
can the sector start on this path? It will require 
collective action by all institutions. And based on our 
assessment, the following five actions are crucial  
to facilitating the journey:

1.  Commit to the 52.5 million adult learners as  

a priority student population through creative 
support structures, more-flexible class 
schedules, and tailored instructional modalities. 
As the needs of employers and students  
evolve, so too should educational approaches. 
Encouraging a culture of innovation will  
allow institutions to develop novel solutions to 
improve access and completion, provide  
the flexibility and specialized instruction adult 
learners need, and better prepare graduates  
for the future of work. 

2.  Fill excess capacity, starting with the 1.65 million 

open seats in top-performing schools by 
completion rate. Many high-performing schools 
can enroll additional students in the near term 
without major changes or investments. Pivoting 
to serve nontraditional adult learners can 
quickly fill empty seats with diverse, passionate 
students and deliver graduates prepared for  
the future of work.

3.  Deploy student-specific, data-driven 

interventions to improve access and close the 
45-percentage-point gap in completion  
rates, supporting students from enrollment to 
employment. Students who start but do not 
complete a certificate or degree program face 
high debt burdens, dramatically reduced 
earning potential, and fewer employ ment 
prospects. Many factors contribute

academic preparation, lack of financial 
resources, and unclear program requirements 
and pathways. Delivering on the promise of 
higher education requires counseling students 
toward institutions where they are most likely  
to succeed and novel solutions for overcoming 
barriers to completion. A large body of well-
established interventions can be implemented 
at little to no cost per student to begin  
creating a more accessible and supportive 
environment for adult learners. 

4.  Guide students toward high-employment 

pathways through enrollment in the 64 percent 
of postsecondary programs that offer positive 
ROI within ten years. Postgraduation regret 
regarding academic program or institution is 
strongly correlated with low income.65 To  
ensure that students graduate with manageable 
debt and sustainable career trajectories,  
higher education professionals need to counsel 
them toward brighter prospects and promote 
greater transparency about program outcomes 
and alumni salaries. 

5.  Explore options to improve college affordability 

through cost efficiency and new financing 
mechanisms for the $1.2 trillion cost of educating 
these students. Funders should step up their 
investment in underresourced minority-serving 
institutions and schools that serve adult 
learners and other nontraditional students. 
There may be ways to encourage greater 
investment, such as public-agency support, 

private philanthropy, and new financing  
models. Institutions with excess capacity could 
increase resource utilization and realize 
potential cost efficiencies by building capa-
bilities to attract and graduate adult learners. In 
addition, long-term reduction in institutional 
costs may help alleviate the constant upward 
pressure on tuition and fees for all students. 

Beyond the work of individual institutions, some 
sectorwide actions could improve access and 
completion rates. These include greater transparency 
about outcomes (particularly regarding equity  
gaps, completion rates, and employment), stronger 
transfer pathways, dual-enrollment programs 
between two- and four-year institutions, and greater 
standardization and streamlining of credit-transfer 
processes between institutions. The sector could 
also benefit from more systemwide initiatives to 
support new learners, such as student readiness 
and wraparound programs, universal college 
savings accounts, new technologies and learning 
modalities, and national or state programs  
to recruit and support adults who were close to 
graduating but did not earn their degrees.

The time to act is now. The United States needs 
more graduates to fill skilled jobs, increase  
civic engagement, improve health outcomes and 
national security, and drive greater economic 
growth, mobility, and competitiveness. And hanging 
in the balance are individuals—ten million of them—
on whom the future of the nation, and its promise, 
may well rest.
