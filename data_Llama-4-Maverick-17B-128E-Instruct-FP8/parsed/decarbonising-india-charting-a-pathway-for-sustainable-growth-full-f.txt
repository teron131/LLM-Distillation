Preface

The physical manifestations of climate 
change are increasingly visible across 
the globe, and India is not untouched. 
More than 75 percent of India’s 
districts—home to 638 million people, 
or 1.4 times the population of the 
European Union (EU)—are categorised 
as hotspots for extreme climate events 
already.1 India has acknowledged 
this threat in multiple forums, has set 
ambitious targets and is taking bold 
measures to address the risks. 

Though India’s emissions currently 
stand at a mere 1.8 tons CO₂e per capita 
(versus the United States at 14.7 and 
China at 7.6), it is still the world’s 
third-largest emitter at 2.9 GtCO₂e 
(4.9 percent of global emissions).2  
As India grows,3 emissions will only 
increase without a concerted effort 
across multiple sectors of the Indian 
economy. We use external sources for 
GDP growth scenarios in this report and 
don’t make projections or forecasts. 
These scenarios range between 
long term forecasts from reputed 
international agencies such as EIU and 
Oxford Economics and aspirational 
estimates, based on employment 
needs. We have used the former as 
a basis to develop sector growth 
scenarios and hence, GHG emissions. 
With careful planning and execution, 
India can meet its growth ambitions 
while decarbonising.

At COP26, India set out its plan to help 
slow down and halt global warming, 
with a 2070 net-zero target. While we 
support the global net-zero ambition 
of decarbonising by 2050, we have 
used India’s stated national plan as 
the basis for the analysis and scenario 
modelling in this paper. Our analysis 
also shows that the transition though 
difficult is feasible—and could even 
be accelerated. However, we don’t 
foresee India getting all the way to net 
zero in either of our scenarios – the last 
10 percent will be particularly difficult 
to decarbonise.

This report presents an in-depth 
analysis of ways to decarbonise the 
six sectors which contribute to roughly 
70 percent of India’s overall emissions: 
power, automotive, aviation, steel, 
cement and agriculture. Additionally, 
we analyse four cross-cutting enablers 
which can help decarbonise multiple 
sectors: carbon-capture usage and 
storage (CCUS), natural climate 
solutions (NCS), material circularity 
and green hydrogen. More than 
100 emission-reduction initiatives have 
been identified for these key sectors 
and themes, across two scenarios, 
both of which assume an orderly 
transition: (a) The Line of Sight (LoS) 
scenario with current (and announced) 
policies and foreseeable technology 
adoption, and (b) The Accelerated 
scenario with further reaching policies 

such as carbon prices and accelerated 
technology adoption including those of 
technologies like CCUS. It also includes 
estimates for the likely investments this 
transition will need and ways in which to 
finance it.

We started our effort with a 
comprehensive literature review of 
similar knowledge efforts conducted 
in this space. While there are several 
good reports out there, published 
by credentialled organisations, this 
report attempts to differentiate itself 
from others in the following ways: 
it is comprehensive across sectors, 
examines these in depth (including 
with customised and detailed sector 
models), explores implications of  
inter-linkages across sectors, and takes 
a practical, yet aspirational, view of the 
abatement levers. Finally, it defines a 
set of actions that need to be executed 
with urgency if this orderly transition is 
to get underway.

In keeping with our history of exploring 
environmental sustainability issues, 
we offer this report not to prescribe 
what policymakers and industry should 
do, but to provide a factual basis 
for comparing emission-reduction 
approaches. Further, we hope the 
report will help leaders in the public 
and private sectors launch emission-
reduction projects to help secure a 
healthy and prosperous future for India 
and the world.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthExecutive summary

In 2021, at COP26, India announced its 
ambition to become a net-zero emitter 
by 2070.1 Despite low per-capita 
emissions (1.8 tons CO₂ per capita), 
India is the third-largest emitting 
country globally.2 Therefore, if we are to 
win the global war on climate change, 
India will need to play an important 

role. With this in mind, India has taken 
several proactive steps and made 
commitments. For instance, its updated 
Nationally Determined Contribution 
(NDC) for 2030 commits to using half 
of power-installed capacity from  
non-fossil fuel-based energy 
resources and to achieving a 45 percent 
reduction in emissions intensity from its 
2005 levels.3

India currently emits a net of 2.9 GtCO2e 
every year (as of 2019). The bulk of 
these emissions (about 70 percent) 
are driven by six sectors: power, steel, 
automotive, aviation, cement and 
agriculture (Exhibit A).

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThis report identifies the optimal 
uses of more than 100 emission-
reduction levers in these sectors, 
across two scenarios, both of which 
assume an orderly transition: (a) the 
Line of Sight (LoS) scenario with 
current (and announced) policies and 
foreseeable technology adoption 
and (b) the Accelerated scenario 
with further reaching polices like 
carbon prices and accelerated 
technology adoption, including those 
of technologies like CCUS. This report 
attempts to be comprehensive across 
sectors, examining them in depth, 
highlighting linkages across them while 
taking a practical, yet aspirational, view 
of the abatement levers. It attempts to 
define two possible roadmaps for an 
orderly transition for India in the context 
of its continued expected growth. 
Finally, it proposes a set of actions 
that could be executed for an orderly 
transition to get underway. This report 
does not address physical risks and 
adaptation topics.

Our analysis shows that the benefits 
of a well-planned, orderly, accelerated 
transition could far outweigh the 
downsides for India, given its growth 
outlook. India must take steps within 
this decade to set things up. Doing so 
will allow it to use its growth momentum 
and build the country ‘right’ for the 
decades thereafter. Also, while the 
actions needed for India to decarbonise 
are challenging, most of them are 
‘in-the-money’, and hence the journey 
is doable. Eight important messages 
emerge from this:

1.  There is an opportunity for 

India to create 287 Gt of carbon 
space for the world. In the growth 
scenario assumed for this report,4 
India will likely be a $22 trillion 
economy in real 2010-dollar 
terms5 (about seven times its 
current GDP) with a population 

of 1.7 billion by 2070. Even if its 
current GDP emission intensity 
reduction were to continue at the 
same rate, India’s annual emissions 
would still rise to 11.8 GtCO₂e by 
2070 (from 2.9 GtCO₂e in 2019).6 
Getting to the LoS scenario 
would create 207 GtCO₂e of 
carbon space till 2070, while 
the Accelerated scenario would 
add a further 80 GtCO₂e. This 
is equivalent to 36 percent and 
14 percent, respectively, of the 
remaining carbon budget for an 
even chance at limiting warming 
to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is 
despite India not reaching net 
zero in either of our scenarios, 
due to the residual emissions from 
agriculture and select industrial 
sectors (remaining emissions in 
2070 of 1.8 and 0.4 GtCO₂e in the 
LoS and Accelerated scenarios, 
respectively). These emissions 
have been largely estimated with 
currently feasible technologies. 
It is to be expected that India 
could get to its net-zero-by-2070 
commitment through the upcoming 
technology developments over 
the next decades (e.g., direct air 
capture {DAC}).

2.  While achieving the LoS scenario 
reductions will be challenging, 
achieving those of the 
Accelerated scenario will be even 
more so. While there are emerging 
tailwinds in the form of falling 
costs of renewables and electrical 
vehicles (EVs) and some policies are 
beginning to be implemented (e.g., 
Faster Adoption and Manufacturing 
of {Hybrid &} Electric Vehicles in 
India {FAME} for EVs, an imputed 
$140–240 per ton of CO₂e tax on 
motor fuels7), several other actions 
with significant scale up are needed. 
For example, renewable capacity 
addition has to increase from 10 GW 

to 40–50 GW per year, a carbon 
price has to be put in place to make 
green steel competitive, battery 
costs have to decline by 80 percent 
by 2050, hydrogen by two-thirds 
by 2035, a nationwide roll out of 
charging infrastructure has to 
happen, farmers have to adopt new 
practices for rice cultivation, targets 
for circularity have to be met and 
higher targets have to be set. 

3.  If India is to have an orderly and 
accelerated decarbonisation, 
the transition has to be set up 
within this decade. Over three-
fourths of the India of 2050 (and 
80+ percent of the India of 2070) 
is yet to be built. This growth could 
multiply demand across sectors: 
power (eightfold), steel (eightfold), 
cement (triple), automotive (triple) 
and food (double). If policies are 
set in place to create the right 
demand signals within this decade, 
then the capacities India adds in 
the two decades thereafter will 
be low carbon ones. For example, 
in steel, the early imposition of a 
carbon price could lead to 200 Mt 
of steel capacity being built on the 
low carbon hydrogen route instead 
of the coal route by 2050. This has 
happened before – policies put 
in place early in the decade of the 
2010s have led to the explosion of 
renewables capacity in the recent 
past and will continue to enable 
even greater capacity expansion 
going forward.8 These policies could 
provide a clear outlook on carbon 
prices in three years, as also on 
forward-looking blending mandates 
(e.g., for aviation fuels) and a 
national land use plan, encourage 
local manufacturing capabilities and 
gear up financial institutions to lend 
to green projects at scale, amongst 
other things. The government can 
also define its plans and policies

 Real GDP growth rate assumption based on Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) projection for 2020–30 is 5.8 percent, 2030–40 is 5.1 percent and 2040–50 is 
4.7 percent. 2050–70 Real GDP growth rate has been assumed to be about 3 percent annually.

5  Based on Economist Intelligence Unit projection of $12.5 trillion by 2050 (Real GDP - USD at 2010 prices) and extrapolated to 2070 with 3 percent  

CAGR assumption; This GDP forecast represents a more conservative estimate compared to other estimates - we have considered the lower range of growth in our 
analyses to build a more robust decarbonisation pathway.

with investment across sectors, 
technology development, customer-
demand creation, economic viability 
and funding, if it is to enable an 
orderly transition. 

4.  India would benefit from this. 
India’s transition from thermal 
power to renewables is expected 
to decrease the average cost 
of power supply from INR 6.15/
kWh in FY20 to INR 5.25/kWh 
and INR 5.4/kWh by 2050 in the 
LoS and Accelerated scenarios, 
respectively.9 Sustainable farming 
practices could help generate 
additional farmer income of 
INR 3400/hectares (ha)/annum 
in the LoS scenario which could 
increase to INR 4800/ha/annum 
in the Accelerated scenario. India 
may save a cumulative $1.7 trillion 
in Forex which may otherwise 
be spent on energy imports 
till 2070. In addition, India will 
have the opportunity to build 
right the first time, minimising 
asset stranding. Finally, if India 
can get manufacturing in newer 
technologies going, it can be a world 
leader in batteries, electrolysers, 
green steel and many other areas. 

5. 

 There would be shifts in the 
energy system. Fossil fuels, 
which comprise 75 percent of 
India’s commercial energy mix 
today, decline to half in the LoS 
scenario and one-sixth in the 
Accelerated scenario by 2050.10 
In the Accelerated scenario, over 
60 percent of India’s refining 
capacity, 90 percent of its coal-
mining capacity, 100 percent of its 
coal power generation would not 
be needed. Tax collections from 
automotive fuel, which at $85 billion 
comprise 18 percent of the annual 
central government income, could 
decline to $36 billion by 2050.11 
Scarce biomass feedstock would 

need to be directed to the right 
use. For example, the biomass 
currently being used by households 
for cooking and which in future 
could be used for thermal power 
generation might need to get 
directed to the hard-to-abate 
sectors like cement; or sugarcane-
based methanol for the transport 
sector might need to get directed 
to aviation.

6.  The pressure on land systems 
will increase. Growth and 
decarbonisation combined may 
require 45 million ha more land than 
is available (Accelerated scenario). 
Almost 10 million ha of this would be 
needed for renewable power and 
8 million ha for carbon sinks and 
forests. Innovative land optimisation 
techniques such as maximising 
barren land use for renewable 
power, vertical urbanisation, 
improved agricultural productivity, 
higher forest density would all be 
needed to ensure there is sufficient 
land to use for decarbonisation. 

7.  There would be a moderate 

impact on household spending 
and jobs. A critical consideration 
is what impact accelerated 
decarbonisation would have on 
Indian household spending and 
jobs. We estimate that by 2040, 
the adverse income impact on 
people with low incomes from 
decarbonisation through increased 
housing costs would mostly be 
balanced by the limited impact on 
food costs (excluding impact on 
yields from direct climate change) 
and the decrease in the costs of 
energy and transport. This, of 
course, presumes an orderly 
transition – if there is a disorderly 
transition, the inflationary impact 
on people with low incomes could 
be adverse. This also assumes that 
households can mobilise financing 
for spends where the Capex is 

higher upfront even though the 
Opex is lower later (e.g., EVs). 
Without this support, their up-front 
capital expenditure may go up. 
Accelerated decarbonisation 
could transform over 30 million 
jobs (24 million new jobs could 
be created while six million of 
the existing jobs could be lost) 
by 2050.12 However, this number 
is relatively small in the context 
of the macro trends affecting 
India’s workforce (e.g., 60 million 
joining the workforce by 2030, 30 
million needing to come off farms 
into non-farm jobs).13 That said, 
specific communities (e.g., coal 
mining and associated enterprises, 
Eastern India) could be adversely 
impacted, requiring reskilling and 
alternative industrial development 
in particular areas.

8.  Large funding would be needed  
(3.5–6 percent of GDP), front 
loaded, but substantially in 
the money. India may need an 
estimated $7.2 trillion of green 
investments until 2050 to 
decarbonise in the LoS scenario 
and an additional $4.9 trillion for 
the Accelerated scenario (about 
3.5 percent and 2.4 percent of 
India’s GDP through this period, 
respectively). 50 percent of the 
abatement between the LoS and 
the Accelerated scenarios is ‘in 
the money’, particularly across the 
renewable energy (RE), automotive 
and agriculture sectors; others 
would need policy support. The net 
spend (Capex minus Opex savings) 
is front loaded – the Accelerated 
scenario would, net of operational 
savings, require $1.8 trillion more 
in the decade of the 2030s and 
$0.6 trillion more in the decade of 
the 2040s than the LoS scenario.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe decarbonisation pathway

India has reduced its emissions 
intensity of GDP by 1.3 percent per 
annum over the last decade, somewhat 
decoupling emissions from GDP 
growth.14 However, this pace of intensity 
reduction is not quick enough. It will not 
cause India’s emissions curve to bend, 
given the fast growth expected. India’s 
GHG emissions would likely increase 
to 11.8 GtCO₂e by 2070 even assuming 
the reduction in current GDP emissions 
intensity. The LoS pathway would 
reduce annual emissions to 1.9 GtCO₂e 

by 2070 leading to a 90 percent 
reduction in economic emissions 
intensity versus 2019. The Accelerated 
pathway could further close the gap to 
net zero and reduce annual emissions 
to 0.4 GtCO₂e leading to a 98 percent 
reduction in emissions intensity by 
2070 versus 2019. The LoS scenario 
would lead to cumulative carbon 
savings of 207 GtCO₂e by 2070 
while the Accelerated scenario would 
create further savings of 80 GtCO₂e 
cumulatively by 2070 (Exhibits B, C, D).15

Tackling the 0.4 GtCO₂e of annual 
emissions in 2070, remaining in the 
Accelerated scenario (Exhibit D) 
predominantly from industry and 
agriculture, will require technological 
advancements, including improved 
capture technologies, newer recycling 
technologies and ocean-based carbon 
sequestration.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthInvestment, currently at $44 billion 
per annum, will likely need to increase 
3.6 times by 2030 and 10 times by 
2040. This is doable so long as early 
action is taken to facilitate the transition 
within this decade, given that a very 
large proportion of the decarbonisation 
levers are in the money. 

The challenge of rapid 
decarbonisation

Achieving the LoS reductions will be 
challenging, those in the Accelerated 
scenario even more so. India has moved 
in several sectors with rapid pace – 
renewables, energy efficiency, EVs, 
hydrogen. While the results are there 
for all to see in the continued reduction 
in carbon intensity of GDP, and with 
several sectors poised for scale up, 
there are also major challenges to be 
overcome (Exhibit E). 

For example, in the Accelerated 
scenario, renewable (wind and solar) 
capacity addition will likely increase 
from 10–12 GW per year today to  
50 GW per year in 2030 and 90 GW 
per year in 2040. Ten times as much 
land as is used today would need to 
be identified and made available. 
Panels and corresponding raw material 
manufacturing may need to be scaled 
up, given 80–90 percent of the solar 
panels are imported currently.

In automotive, 100 percent of two 
wheelers, three wheelers and light 
truck sales may need to be electric 
early in the next decade, all car sales 
would have to be electric by 2035 and 
trucks by 2050. For this, battery costs 
may need to decline by 40 percent 
in 2030 relative to today. Charging 
stations would need to increase 
13 times by 2030 and 40 times by 
2040 relative to today. Consumer 
financing, given higher, up front EV 
costs and raw materials for batteries, 
will need to be found.

Green hydrogen, which is not going to 
be economical versus other alternatives 
until 2030, would need a subsidy 
of $60–80/KW for electrolyser 
manufacturing and carbon prices 
(within this decade) to support uptake 
for its largest use case of green 
steelmaking. 29 GW of electrolysers 
may need to be installed by 2030 
(relative to the current deployment of 
about 1.4 GW, globally16) and almost 
400 GW by 2040.

Across other industries, steel would 
need growth in hydrogen green steel 
capacity from nil today to 152 Mt by 
2040 while blast furnace–basic  oxygen 
furnace (BF-BOF) capacity would need 
to see an increase from 55 Mt today to 
119 Mt by 2030 and then a decrease 
to 85 Mt by 2040. Coal-based power 
generation would have to transition 
from 211 GW today to 120 GW by 2040 
and nil by 2050. Refining capacities 
would need to decrease from 213 Mt 
per annum today to 114 Mt per annum 
by 2040 and 105 Mt per annum 
by 2050.

Additional land would be needed 
to meet India’s land requirements. 
This may be needed for agriculture 
(12 million ha by 2040), solar plants 
(5 million ha by 2040), forest 
densification (4 million ha by 2040), 
etc. However, sufficient volumes of 
suitable land will not be readily available 
unless efficient land use practices 
are implemented.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthAddressing the challenges would 
need to happen in concert – with 
stakeholders playing together in 
harmony. The government would  
need to create demand signals and the 
industrial sector would have to bring 
capacity. Equity and debt funders may 
have to understand the risk and bring 
financing at an unprecedented level. 
Consumers would have to adapt fast.

The risk of a disorderly transition is 
very high – it has been seen recently in 
the coal shortages India experienced 
post-Covid as demand bounced 
back. Disorderly transitions can 
occur in many ways. For example – 
under investment in fossil fuel-based 
capacities (e.g., coking coal-based 

steel), even as the demand signals 
don’t build up quickly enough for green 
steel, leading to import dependence; 
grid instability and power shortages 
because of the unbalanced build up of 
storage capacity or inappropriate use 
of existing stabilisation sources like 
hydropower; demand compression due 
to increased upfront consumer prices 
for EVs if banks are unable to assess 
risks and support the higher capital 
costs; inflation for recycled material if 
blending mandates are enforced and 
the recycling infrastructure does not 
keep pace; new fossil-based capacity 
build up getting derailed if climate 
changes force sudden closure.

Major areas of emission reduction 
need urgent action for an orderly 
transition

The Accelerated decarbonisation 
scenario can cumulatively abate 80 
GtCO₂e more than the LoS scenario 
till 2070. More than 80 percent of 
this abatement is achievable with 
seven levers: renewable energy, 
electrification of mobility, use 
of hydrogen, implementation of 
sustainable agriculture practices, 
material circularity, NCS and CCUS 
(Exhibit F). Getting these sectors set 
up for an accelerated transition would 
need urgent action within this decade. 

Exhibit F

More than 80% of abatement can be achieved through 7 key levers.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthi.  Expand renewable energy 
capacity: 100 percent 
decarbonisation by 2050 in the 
Accelerated scenario as opposed to 
by 2070 in the LoS scenario would 
result in abating 16 GtCO₂e by 2070. 
With wind-and solar-generation 
technologies already available at 
scale, power would be the quickest 
sector to decarbonise, potentially 
reaching net-zero emissions by the 
mid-2050s.

India’s solar and wind capacity 
would need to increase from its 
current 95 GW17 to 2700 GW by 
2050, representing a 95 percent 
share of generation. This would 

need an acceleration in the annual 
build to 40–50 GW from the current 
10 GW a year. Ex-bus bar solar 
tariffs are currently in the range of 
INR 2.0–2.5/kWh; lower than the 
marginal generation cost for  
60–70 percent of coal power 
plants.18 This gap is likely to widen 
further. Transition to renewable 
sources of electricity would also 
decrease power generation costs 
from the current INR 3.9/kWh 
to INR 2.9/kWh by 2050, with 
lower cost renewables and  
grid-stabilising storage. To 
accelerate renewable energy 
production, India would have to 
quadruple the rate of capacity 

addition, resolve supply side 
bottlenecks (land, grid, etc.), 
accelerate market reforms and 
storage buildout (1200 GW by 
2050) for integration of renewables 
and grid reliability, foster innovation 
and localise manufacturing. 
A quarter to two-fifths of the energy 
supply can be from infirm sources 
till 2030 in the LoS and Accelerated 
scenarios, respectively (Exhibit G). 
The capacity in both scenarios 
will likely double in the decade of 
the 2030s and double again in 
the 2040s. The basics, including 
capacity-inducing and investment-
reducing market reform would need 
to be put in place now.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthIn the Accelerated scenario, all 
new vehicle sales are assumed 
to shift to EVs fully around 2030 
for two wheelers, around 2040 
for cars and 2040–2050 for CVs. 
These assumptions are based on 
total cost of ownership (TCO) parity 
which needs to be balanced out by 
market maturity considerations. 
Typical maturity bottlenecks, which 
need to be solved, include adequate 
availability of EV models, charging and 
swapping infrastructure maturity as 
well as incentive/dis-incentive schemes 
as proposed by the government. 
The infrastructure bottlenecks need 
decadal Capex investments to the 

tune of $3 trillion for which the green 
financing needs to be sorted out. 
This transition would be enabled by 
a) further reducing battery costs and 
fuel cells through at-scale localisation; 
b) continuing government support 
through GST and FAME benefits and 
fossil fuel taxation; c) achieving the 
target modal mix of 45 percent for 
rail freight by 2040; and d) targeting 
affirmative action on select transitions, 
e.g., commercial fleets, especially 
heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs).

ii.  Increase penetration of 

EVs across vehicle types. 
Electrification of mobility would 
likely deliver 7 GtCO₂e of cumulative 
abatement from now till 2070 
between the LoS and Accelerated 
scenarios. This is underway due 
to advances in battery technology 
(storage capacity up two times, 
cost reduction of 17 percent 
every year over the last 10 years). 
It enjoys explicit support from 
the government (GST benefit 
of five percent for EVs versus 
28–51 percent for internal 
combustion engine {ICE} vehicles; 
FAME, production-linked incentives 
{PLI}).19 Perhaps the most important 
factor is an implicit carbon tax on 
transportation fuels of $140 to 240/
tCO₂e (Exhibit H, I).

iii.  Ramp up green hydrogen as 

fuel or feedstock: Hydrogen is 
a versatile energy source and 
chemical reductant. Adoption of 
green hydrogen could enable an 
annual abatement of 900 MtCO₂e 
for India by 2050. This is subject 
to the evolution of the cost 
competitiveness of green hydrogen 
against alternative energy sources, 
which can be accelerated by faster 
R&D, adopting technology and 
ensuring early demand that drives 
down costs. Green hydrogen 
demand would first 

emerge as a replacement for grey 
hydrogen in use cases like refining, 
urea, methanol as it becomes more 
competitive versus grey hydrogen 
by 2030. In our LoS scenario,  
hard-to-abate sectors such as 
steel, automotive and power would 
drive demand only in the decade of 
the 2040s. These sectors have the 
potential to drive a disproportionate 
portion of the demand for green 
hydrogen in the decade of the 2030s 
and 2040s with blending mandates 
and a carbon price of $50 per tonne 
(Exhibits J, K).

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthAccelerating hydrogen adoption in 
steel-making will help India build 
sustainable assets that could help India 
in its decarbonisation journey. The steel 
industry will likely make an investment 
of about $265 billion over the next 
30 years in the new BF-BOF capacity 
installation, which could run the risk 
of getting stranded in case of climate 
shock or early closure, even with India’s 
2070 net-zero NDC. Indian steelmakers 
could avoid this risk by investing early 
in green hydrogen-based steelmaking 
instead of going down the conventional 
blast furnace route to the tune of 
200 Mt starting from 2030 (Exhibit L). 
This would need to be enabled by the 
right policies including a carbon price 
of $50/t, plans for which would have to 
be in place within two or three years for 
steelmakers to plan their investments. 

This would create additional carbon 
space of 5.7 GtCO₂e, and result 
in cumulative Forex savings of 
$280 billion on coking coal imports by 
2050. Early adoption of hydrogen also 
enables Forex savings of $420 billion 
on oil & gas imports.

iv.  Reform agriculture and dietary 
systems: Decarbonisation in the 
agriculture sector can lead to annual 
carbon abatement of 292 MtCO₂e 
by 2050, or nearly half of all 
expected annual emissions from 
agriculture. This would mainly be 
driven by cultivating rice sustainably 
(20 percent of abatement), reducing 
nitrate fertilisers (16 percent) 
and shifting towards sustainable 
consumer alternatives such as 
plant-based protein (15 percent) and 
millets (7 percent).

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthPaddy farming and livestock account 
for 70 percent of agricultural 
emissions (Exhibit M).20 Reducing 
paddy farming emissions by practicing 
rice-straw upcycling, dry seeding 
and rice intensification (SRI) over 
half of India’s rice cultivated area 
and reducing livestock emissions by 
adopting efficient feeding and manure 
management practices for half the 
livestock population would be critical 
for decarbonising agriculture.

v.  Drive material circularity: India 
currently generates 750–800 
million tonnes of waste across 

waste streams with recycling rates 
of 13 percent for non-agricultural 
waste streams.21 Improvement 
in recycling rates to 80 percent 
could provide significant recycled 
raw material and help abate up 
to 34 GtCO₂e by 2070 in the 
Accelerated scenario (12 GtCO₂e 
more than in the LoS scenario which 
assumes recycling rates increasing 
to 55 percent). Recycled raw 
materials help save 50–95 percent 
emissions in material production 
across steel (scrap-based electric 
arc furnace {EAF} steel production), 

cement (recycled concrete, 
biomass fuels), plastic (recycled 
feedstock, recycled plastics), 
aluminium and other materials.22 
While most technologies for 
recycling various waste streams 
already exist, driving material 
circularity would require investment 
in recycling infrastructure as 
well as enforcement of waste 
management and extended 
producer responsibility regulations. 
Demand signals would need to be 
created through recycled material 
use mandates.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthvi.  Sequester using natural climate 
solutions (NCS): NCS can help 
remove or sequester emissions 
through the conservation and 
restoration of nature. In the 
Accelerated scenario, India’s 
natural resources can sequester 
640 MtCO₂e annually by 2050, 
nearly 300 MtCO₂e higher than 
the 2019 levels and 230 MtCO₂e 
more than the LoS scenario. 
This translates to additional 
sequestration of 3 GtCO₂e between 
2020 and 2050, and 7 GtCO₂e 
by 2070 compared to the LoS 
scenario. Nearly 85 percent of 
sequestration would come from 
forests (avoiding deforestation, 

reforestation), agroforestry 
(trees in cropland, regenerative 
agriculture) and urban tree 
plantation. This would involve 
restoring an additional eight million 
hectares of forest (over 10 percent 
of current forest cover) and 
practicing regenerative agriculture 
(such as low-till farming) in at least 
half of India’s croplands, as opposed 
to 20–25 percent adoption in an 
LoS scenario. A $50 per tCO₂e  
carbon price will enable this 
sequestration (Exhibit O).

expensive and would require significant 
investment and R&D to scale and 
become cost-effective, and is likely to 
be a small abatement lever.

vii.  Scale CCUS across industries: 
Adoption of new carbon-capture 
technologies could help reduce 
industrial emissions further, 
particularly for hard-to-abate 
sectors like cement, oil and gas 
and chemicals. CCUS could help 
capture 11.4 GtCO₂e across these 
sectors cumulatively by 2070

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthmoves away from coal-based power 
generation to renewables such as solar 
and wind, thermal coal demand would 
reduce drastically. Primary energy 
demand in the Accelerated scenario 
would be lower by 18 to 24 percent 
between 2030 and 2050 driven by 
higher energy efficiency, circularity and 
shifts in material use.

Implications for energy 
systems

India depends on fossil fuels to meet 
approximately 75 percent of its current 
energy demand.23 This declines rapidly 
in both the scenarios (Exhibit Q). 
For example, decarbonisation in the 
transportation sector would require 
shifting from petroleum-fuel cars to 
EVs. The industry sector would shift 
from a reliance on fossil fuels to a mix 
of electricity, hydrogen and biomass 
for its manufacturing processes. In 
agriculture, farm equipment would 
become electric. And, as India

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthImplications for the 
Accelerated scenario:

 — Shrinkage in refining capacity: 
The current refining capacity of 
250 Mt per annum would increase 
to 298 Mt per annum by 2030 
but then 182 Mt per annum of 
refining capacity would need to be 
repurposed or abandoned by 2040. 
Refiners can repurpose some of the 
existing refinery assets to produce 
petrochemicals, green hydrogen, 
ammonia, synthetic fuels, etc.

 — Reduction in tax revenues: The 

total contribution of the petroleum 
sector to the exchequer is 
$103 billion, of which $85 billion is 
tax collection. In the Accelerated 
scenario, the tax collection may 
drop to $35 billion by 2050.24

 — Reduction in coal mining and 
closure of coal-based power 
plants: By 2050, coal consumption 
for power would be reduced to 
a tenth of current consumption 
and all current coal-based power 
capacity (211 GW) would need to 
be decommissioned. Most of this 
decline would be driven by the 
power sector’s shift to renewable 
energy sources. The remaining coal 
used to make steel and generate 
heat in cement production would 
also be phased out over time, as 
the consumption of green fuels 
such as electricity, hydrogen and 
bioenergy increased.

 — Corrected use of biomass and 

agri-based fuels. Today, the bulk 
of bioenergy demand is in the form 
of biomass usage in residential 
buildings for cooking purposes. 
The remaining demand, which 
amounts to less than a quarter 
of total demand, comes from the 
power sector. Going forward, 
scarce feedstock would need to 
be directed to be used correctly. 
For example, the biomass currently 
being used for the power sector and 
agri-based fuels for the transport 
sector will need to get directed 
to the hard-to-abate sectors like 
cement and aviation, respectively. 
The bio-fuels usage envisaged for 
the future could fundamentally 
transform how agriculture residue 
will be used in the future versus how 
it is directly burnt today.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthto create higher population densities in 
towns and cities, instead of increasing 
the overall built-up area. However, 
these measures will likely free up only 
34 million ha, leaving a further 11 million 
ha unsolved for.

Implications for land use
India has a total land area of 329 million 
hectare, out of which 21 million ha 
consists of inland waters, leaving a 
total of 308 million ha of available land. 
Today, 23 percent of this available land 
is forest area, 59 percent is agricultural 
land and the remaining 18 percent is 
used for non-agricultural purposes, 
grazing pastures and barren land.25 
As India grows in a sustainable fashion 
in the Accelerated scenario, it will need 
land not only for urbanisation, industrial 
capacity and increasing agricultural 
output but also for renewable power, 
carbon sinks and biomass feedstock for 
decarbonisation. 

Based on current land usage practices, 
we estimate that the total increased 
land area requirement would be 
45 million ha in 2050 versus today 
(Exhibit R). However, this land is not 
readily available, and India will have to 
implement efficient land use practices 
to ensure that necessary land can 
be made available. These measures 
would need to be innovative and 
could include increasing agricultural 
productivity by adopting sustainable 
and higher-yield farming practices, 
using barren land for installing solar 
and wind power plants, increasing the 
density of forests to meet carbon sink 
goals and using vertical urbanisation

financing does not come, this would 
impact affordability and demand. 

Impact on people – 
spending and jobs

A critical consideration for accelerated 
decarbonisation is the impact it will 
have on the average Indian household’s 
spending. Our estimate suggests 
that there will be minimal inflationary 
impact on households below the 
Empowerment Line26 by 2040 
(Exhibit S). Food spending sees no 
major impact (expenditure in agriculture 
may be offset by cost savings from 

sustainable practices and improved 
productivity), whereas energy and 
transport spending are reduced due 
to lower power generation costs with 
renewables and operational savings 
due to the shift from ICE vehicles to 
EVs. Housing could become somewhat 
more expensive due to the increase 
in steel and cement prices. This is a 
preliminary viewing that could bear 
more precise analysis. Also, this 
assumes that higher upfront costs of

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe accelerated decarbonisation is 
expected to impact jobs and skills 
requirements across sectors as 
they decarbonise. India’s coal mines 
are estimated to employ around 
0.35 million workers currently. 
Additionally, more than 1.7 million 
people are indirectly dependent on 
the coal sector.27 The phasing out of 
coal as India decarbonises would need 
to be supported by new businesses 
that support the transition for this 
workforce. Similarly, as two-thirds of 
the 2030 refining capacity could be 
closed by 2050 in the Accelerated 
scenario, the workforce in this sector 
would also be impacted. However, the 
power sector would likely see an uptick 
in employment with jobs moving from 
non-renewable energy plants to jobs in 
solar and wind projects. The automobile 
industry would see a restructuring from 
ICE manufacturing to EV manufacturing 
roles. The steel and cement sectors 
would also see restructuring from 
BF-BOF to hydrogen-based green 
steel and adoption of new raw materials 
for clinker development, respectively. 

Overall, the Accelerated 
decarbonisation of India could 
transform more than 30 million jobs 
(24 million new jobs could be created 
while six million existing jobs could be 
lost) by 2050.28 While important, the 
scale of workforce reallocation may 
be smaller than that from other macro 
trends (e.g., 60 million new workers 
entering the workforce by 2030). 
Displaced workers will nonetheless 
need support, training and reskilling 
through the transition.29

Reduced energy import 
dependence and opportunity 
to build export competitive 
new industries 
While the primary benefit of 
decarbonisation would be the ability to 
arrest climate change, this transition 
offers other benefits, too. It would result 
in localising India’s energy requirement 
with the shift from coking coal, oil 
and gas to renewable energy, green 
hydrogen and biomass strengthening 
energy security. This could result in 
Forex savings of $2.4–3.0 trillion by 
2070. Further, India could also aspire 
to becoming a global manufacturing 
hub for green hydrogen, solar panels 
electrolysers and batteries.

However, the cost savings are not 
balanced across sectors. The domestic 
transportation, power and agriculture 
sectors would derive most of the 
operating cost savings, while sectors 
like steel and cement would see an 
increase in operating costs, in addition 
to the capital investments.

Accelerated decarbonisation will likely 
create operational cost savings, such as 
lowering the cost of power generation 
due to the increased penetration of 
renewables. As a result, some portion 
of the additional investment could be 
recuperated through operating cost 
savings. The investments required 
are front-loaded; India would have a 
runway till 2040 to orchestrate half 
of the total $12.1 trillion requirement. 
The balance half of investments would 
be required from 2040–2050. From 
now until 2050, operating costs would 
lead to overall savings of $2.1 trillion, 
offsetting about 45 percent of the 
capital investment required over the 
same period (Exhibit V).

Spending on physical assets in accelerated scenario, minus those in LoS scenario for capex and vice versa for opex; excluding opex reduction in refining sector 
(which is mainly due to reduction of the refining activity).
Estimation of capex includes spending on physical assets in power, mobility, steel, cement, agriculture, CCUS, hydrogen, circular economy and other industries. 
Estimation of opex includes spend for physical assets across various forms of energy supply (e.g., power systems, hydrogen, and fuel supply), energy demand (e.g., 
for vehicles, alternate methods of steel and cement production), and various forms of land use (e.g., GHG-efficient farming practices).
Calculated as spending on physical assets net of operating costs in that period, divided by GDP in the period. GDP is for the cumulative GDP from 2021–2050 is 
taken directly from IHS-Markit.
Savings from one sector may not directly compensate for capex requirement of other sectors and numbers shown present a macro-economic view for the nation.

cost $47/tCO₂e till 2040.  
From 2040–2070, it would cost  
$9.6/tCO₂e. An estimated carbon price 
of $40–50 /tCO₂e could potentially 
drive domestic carbon credits 
generation by making all sequestration 
levers cost competitive.

Current annual investments toward 
decarbonisation and other green 
projects are about $44 billion (heavily 
skewed toward the power sector), 
accounting for 10–12 percent of the 
future investment required.30 The 
Accelerated scenario optimises 
net system-level costs at country 
level. However, most businesses 
and consumers are unlikely to take 
decisions based on total cost of 
ownership. Without intervention, 
these stakeholders may well make 
decisions different from those laid out 
here, basing their spending decisions 
on factors like upfront capital costs. 
Thus, financing the transition will 
require targeted demand- and  
supply-side interventions. 

The cost of decarbonisation is expected 
to decline as technologies mature – 
even in a high growth economy, as 
innovation and economies of scale 
lower technology costs over time.
As a result, between the Accelerated 
and LoS scenarios, two-thirds of 
the emissions could be abated at 
negative or low cost (<$10/tCO₂e) and 
50 percent of the emissions could be 
abated through in-the-money levers 
(Exhibit W). Solar energy, wind power 
and EVs, comprising the first quintile 
of the abatement potential, present a 
positive investment case. The levers in 
the last quintile are the high-cost ones, 
comprising some advanced agriculture 
practices, offshore wind, CCUS, etc. 
which would cost more than $60/
tCO₂e. Hydrogen-based steel would

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth Enabling banks to support the 
transition, catalysed by a green 
transition bank. Banks could 
be asked to come up with their 
investment glide paths within a 
year or two and build the necessary 
capability for assessing risks in 
these new spaces. The regulator 
could assist with the necessary 
taxonomy, disclosure guidelines, 
actions to reduce risks. A green 
transition bank with a clearly 
defined set of green financing 
norms can act as the catalyst 
for change. 

4. 

 Accelerate renewable adoption 
in the power sector to scale up 
capacity addition 4X, and to deepen 
market reforms with a 30-year 
outlook in a manner that ensures 
a stable grid fed predominantly 
by infirm power. These market 
reforms can reduce the investment 
requirements by $150–200 billion 
by 2050.

5. 

 Empower a nodal authority to 
define a national land use plan, 
lay clear land-use guidelines and 
mandates for optimised use across 
urbanisation, industrial needs, 
carbon sinks, agriculture and 
renewables.

This report proposes ten actions 
needed today within the context 
highlighted to accelerate India’s 
decarbonisation:

3. 

1. 

2. 

 Lay out a detailed, medium-term 
(5 - 15 - 25-year) decarbonisation 
plan with sector-specific priorities 
and policy frameworks that 
provides demand signals and guides 
corporates to invest. The plan will 
need to be implemented through 
an accountable nodal agency 
so as to ensure coordination 
across ministries and external 
stakeholders in delivering  
net-zero. The governance 
mechanism employed must 
include compensating mechanisms 
to address socioeconomic impact. 
Delays in doing this or quality gaps 
(e.g., inconsistent policies across 
sectors, too many changes) would 
lead to the wrong investment 
decisions worth several hundreds 
of billions of dollars, or reduced 
investment, thus leading to a less 
than ideal transition. 

 Accelerate implementation of 
a compliance carbon market 
(within three years). This would 
also require the creation of 
demand signals to accelerate 
decarbonisation, especially in 
the hard-to-abate sectors, and 
incentivise investments in the newer 
technologies like CCUS. Policy 
makers could take a strategic (as 
opposed to a compliance-oriented) 
view of this and work across 
ministries. Getting this right, fast, 
can enable both domestic and 
foreign investment.

Ten urgent actions 
could accelerate India’s 
decarbonisation and ensure  
it is orderly
From our analysis, it appears that 
benefits to India could outweigh the 
downsides of a well-planned, orderly, 
accelerated transition given its growth 
outlook. But it requires that India take 
action within this decade to set things 
up. If it does so, India can use its growth 
momentum to build itself right in the 
decades thereafter.

It is vital for all stakeholders — 
government, corporates, consumers, 
civil society — to come together and 
act now and in concert to accelerate 
India’s decarbonisation and ensure it 
is orderly. The government can provide 
policy and regulatory support to make 
projects across sectors economically 
viable. These could include but are 
not limited to incentivising the usage 
of EVs and fuel cell electric vehicles 
(FCEVs) by balancing taxation schemes, 
simplifying regulations for authorising 
and installing new power and grid 
installations, creating demand signals 
for higher-cost green materials like 
steel and generating support for 
localising electrolyser manufacturing. 
Support would also be required to 
ensure a just transition that minimises 
impact on low-income households. 
These actions would need to work 
together and happen in the right 
sequence otherwise they would result 
in shortages, price rise and will be at 
risk of disorderliness.

Achieving the necessary technological 
breakthroughs to reduce emissions 
in hard-to-abate sectors, and 
accelerating their progress to market, 
would require consistent public and 
private investment. It would also require 
greater willingness among business 
leaders and policy makers to adopt 
new technologies. These would include 
longer duration storage technologies 
to capture the seasonality of renewable 
sources, advancement in fuel cell 
technology, improvements in recycling 
technologies.

32

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThese actions would need to be 
supported wholeheartedly by 
consumers such that we see a 
behavioural shift in their approach. 
The government has announced the 
Accelerate Lifestyle for Environment 
(LiFE) mission at CoP26. This would 
be a crucial component for India’s 
transition.  

In closing, India needs thoughtful 
action now for setting itself up for an 
accelerated and orderly transition. 
Looking beyond the short term 
and laying the foundation for this 
transformation within this next decade 
is absolutely imperative. 

9. 

 Enhance the National 
Hydrogen Mission, where 
government could play a key role 
in accelerating demand through 
blending mandates, boosting 
cost competitiveness via capital 
subsidies and R&D investments and 
enabling export opportunities via 
international trade agreements.

10. Companies can aim to play 
on the front foot, evaluating 
investment opportunities that 
this green trend would unlock, 
aligned with India’s national plans 
or opportunities opened up by 
decarbonisation of other countries 
(e.g., green hydrogen derivative 
exports). Heavy emitters could 
immediately set five- to-ten-
year decarbonisation targets, 
and use these to mobilise their 
organisations, looking for the  
value-creating opportunities, 
in addition to investing right for 
the future.

6.  Create a resilient indigenous 
manufacturing capability and 
increase investment in cleantech 
R&D. Efforts would be needed 
to develop local raw material 
resources (e.g., rare earths), secure 
materials from elsewhere in the 
world and produce equipment 
locally through mechanisms like 
the PLI. This would need to be 
supported by a green innovation 
mission which increases the 
investments in R&D across a 
number of the technologies that will 
drive decarbonisation.

7.  Evaluate five CCS hubs in Gujarat 
(Jamnagar), Odisha (Paradeep), 
Rajasthan (Barmer), Maharashtra 
(Pune) and Andhra Pradesh 
(Vizag) potentially in public-private 
partnership for utilisation and 
storage of captured carbon.

8.   Create a national circularity 

mission with recycling hubs in the 
top 20 Indian cities (contributing 
35 percent of municipal solid 
waste), mandated targets on 
recycling rates, recycled raw 
material use (e.g., blending norms) 
and landfill levies.

friendly lifestyles; and the Energy 
Conservation bill introduced in Lok 
Sabha that mandates buildings with a 
minimum connected load of 100 KW to 
use renewable sources, empowers the 
government to specify a carbon-credit 
trading scheme and a minimum share 
of energy consumption from non-fossil 
sources for designated consumers.

There is no better time than now 
for India to push for an accelerated 
decarbonisation trajectory. Much of 
the India of 2050 is yet to be built, 
with India’s GDP estimated to grow four 
times37 over this period. If India builds 
it right, it has the unique opportunity 
to decarbonise without slowing 
the economy down. This can also 
serve as an inspiration to other high 
growth economies.

Situation today
India’s current net GHG emissions 
are 2.9 GtCO₂e every year (after 
accounting for 0.3 GtCO₂e negative 
emissions). The bulk of these emissions 
(70 percent) are driven by five sectors 
– power, steel, automotive, cement 
and agriculture (Exhibit 1). India has 
reduced its emission intensity at 
1.3 percent per annum over the last 
decade (Exhibit 2) and has successfully 
decoupled emissions from GDP growth. 
As a result, there was a 24 percent 
decline in economic emissions in 
2016 versus its 2005 levels (excluding 
agricultural emissions).38 

Context
India is the third-largest emitter of GHG 
after China and the US with 2.9 GtCO₂e 
of net emissions per year;31 yet its per 
capita emissions of 1.96 tCO₂e are less 
than a third of the global average of 
6.55 tCO₂e (9 percent of global GHG 
emissions with a 17 percent share of the 
global population). Therefore, despite 
its low per capita emissions, India would 
need to play an outsized role in the 
battle for decarbonisation if the world 
needs to win the war on climate change. 

India is already seeing the impact 
of climate change – in 2019, about 
12 million people were affected by 
intense rainfall and floods with the 
damage done estimated at $10 billion.32 
The country also faced eight tropical 
cyclones that year with six being 
categorised as ‘very severe’.33 At this 
rate, by 2050, India could experience 
a fourfold increase in people exposed 
to severe hazards under a two-degree 
Celsius warming scenario.

In 2021, at COP-26, India announced 
its ambition to achieve net-zero 
emissions by 2070 and presented the 
Panchamrit plan which included NDC 
targets such as 50 percent cumulative 
electric power capacity to be non-fossil 
fuel-based by 2030 and 45 percent 
reduction in the emission intensity 
of GDP by 2030 (over 2005 levels).34 
This has come on the back of a series 
of steps taken by India over the past 
few years toward decarbonisation. 
Over the past two decades, India has 
announced policies like FAME, ACC 
PLI35, the Green Hydrogen Mission, 
a vehicle scrappage policy and 
single-use plastic ban. Additionally, it 
established the Perform, Achieve and 
Trade (PAT) mechanism to improve 
industrial energy efficiency, saving 
60 MtCO₂ between 2016 and 2019;36

India’s current energy system depends on fossil fuels to meet approximately 75 percent of its energy demand (Exhibit 3). 
Power relies mostly on coal; transport consumes mostly oil; biomass is used predominantly in the buildings segment mainly for 
cooking (besides the power consumption required for building) and industry uses a mix of fossil fuels (Exhibit 4).

Over the past 20 years, India’s total 
primary energy demand has been 
growing at four percent per annum, 
compared to an annual GDP growth 
of six and a half percent because 
of energy efficiency improvements 
and growth in the services’ share of 
the economy.39 

India’s energy mix and hence emissions 
are different from the global mix 
(e.g., the EU and Japan) as nuclear 
and renewable energy currently form 

only four percent of India’s energy mix 
versus 20 percent in the EU and eight 
percent in Japan (Exhibit 5). 

India’s transport sector has a big 
carbon footprint across multiple 
modes – road, rail, air, water – and 
spans passenger and goods transport. 
While passenger transport is split 
more or less equally between intra-city 
and inter-city, the long-haul inter-city 
segments dominate goods transport 
(Exhibit 6).

Accordingly, surface transport 
is responsible for the bulk of the 
emissions (over 70–75 percent) and 
a large part of that comes from the 
commercial vehicles used for goods 
transportation (190 MtCO₂e per year for 
FY21, comprising about 75 percent of 
total tailpipe emissions) (Exhibit 7).

Automotive tailpipe emissions 
account for seven to eight percent 
of India’s total GHG emissions. 
Hence the road-mobility segment 
has been discussed in detail in this 
report. In addition, we explore the hard-
to-abate aviation sector. Aviation is 
a significant contributor to India’s 
emissions, accounting for 5 percent 
of total emissions from the transport 
sector, with rapid growth expected 
going forward. Also, emissions from the 
aviation sector have a two to four times 
greater impact on the environment than 
road transport due to the additional 
non-CO₂ pollutants directly released 
into the atmosphere.40

In addition to the power and mobility 
sectors, this report takes an in-depth 
look at three other high-emitting 
sectors: steel, cement and agriculture.

Actions taken by India so far

India has already taken many positive 
steps towards decarbonisation. As per 
the updated NDCs to the United 
Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 
August 2022, India has committed to 
reducing the emissions intensity of its 
GDP by 45 percent by 2030, from its 
2005 levels. In comparison, the 2015 
NDC committed to a 33–35 percent 
reduction target by 2030.41

Renewable energy: India has 
committed to achieving about 
50 percent cumulative electric power 
installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-
based resources by 2030.41 Earlier, a 
target of 175 GW of installed electricity 
capacity from renewables by 2022, 
and 500 GW by 2030 had been set.42 
By June 2022, India’s renewable 
energy capacity (excluding large hydro) 
stood at 114 GW, with 60 GW of projects 

under various stages of development.43 
The latest Energy Conservation 
(Amendment) Bill, 2022, also specifies 
obligations for designated consumers44 
to use non-fossil sources of energy, 
which is expected to spur on demand 
for renewable energy. 

Transport: India’s 2030 vision of 
e-mobility sets EV sales penetration 
targets of 70 percent for commercial 
cars, 30 percent for private cars, 
40 percent for buses and 80 percent 
for two-wheelers and three-wheelers 
by 2030.45 This translates to 102 million 
EVs on-road. In keeping with these 
targets, multiple fiscal and funding 
measures have been announced for 
the promotion of EVs, such as the 
reduction of GST on EVs from 12 to five 
percent and from 18 to five percent for 
EV chargers. The FAME scheme was 
also extended until 2022 with an outlay 
of INR 10,000 crores to incentivise 
EV uptake.46

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthEnergy efficiency: The National 
Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency 
(NMEEE) specifies energy consumption 
reduction in large, energy-consuming 
industries, with a system for companies 
to trade energy-savings certificates. 
The adoption of energy efficiency 
schemes led to overall energy savings 
of 24 Mtoe for the year 2018–19.47 
The PAT scheme for improved energy 
efficiency in industry under the NMEEE 
saved 31 MtCO₂ of emissions in PAT-I 
(2012–15) and 61 MtCO₂ of emissions in 
PAT-II (2016–19).48 

Agriculture: The Pradhan Mantri Krishi 
Sinchayee Yojana (Prime Minister’s 
Agricultural Irrigation Scheme) aimed 
at convergence of investments in 
irrigation at field level, expansion of 
cultivable area and improvement of 
water use efficiency, resulted in an 
emissions reduction of 12 MtCO₂ from 
the period 2017–18 to 2018–19.49 Other 
schemes in crop production, such as 
crop diversification from paddy, direct 
seeding of rice and systems of rice 
intensification, and other agricultural 
sectors such as livestock, horticulture 
and fisheries also contributed to the 
lowering of emissions. 

Material circularity: Extended 
producer responsibility (EPR) 
regulations with the intent to drive 
circularity and improve waste 
management have been in place for 
e-waste since 2016. In 2022, guidelines 
for an EPR programme for plastics and 
tyres were also added to these. The 
EPR guidelines also include targets 
on use of recycled content in plastic 
packaging. Efforts to drive circularity 
have also been taken in the automotive 
and steel sectors. While the ministry of 
steel has indicated clear demand 

signals for use of scrap steel, the new 
vehicle scrappage policy is targeted at 
recovery of old vehicles with the intent 
of material recovery and reducing the 
number of high-emission vehicles 
on-road as well as further enabling the 
transition to EVs.50 

Carbon markets: The recent Energy 
Conservation (Amendment) Bill also 
empowers the central government 
to specify a carbon-credit trading 
scheme.  According to the provisions, 
the central government or any 
authorised agency may issue carbon-
credit certificates to entities compliant 
with the scheme.  Any other person 
may also purchase a carbon-credit 
certificate on a voluntary basis.51 

Hydrogen: The Green Hydrogen Policy 
2022 puts in place several measures 
aimed at promoting a smooth transition 
to green hydrogen and green ammonia, 
both as energy carriers and chemical 
feedstock. This includes waiving 
interstate transmission charges for 
green hydrogen producers, providing 
land for renewable energy parks and 
setting up manufacturing zones.52 

Biofuels: India has also taken steps 
to promote biofuels and biomass. 
The renewable energy capacity target 
of 175 GW by 2022, for instance, 
mandates 10 GW from bio-power.53 
Further, the National Policy on Biofuels 
2018 allows for the use of more 
feedstock in biofuel production and 
advances an ethanol blending target 
of 20 percent in petrol to Ethanol 
Supply Year (ESY) 2025–26 from 2030 
compared to the current blending 
rates of 10.2 percent blending in  
ESY 2021–22.54 

While these are encouraging steps, 
there is still a long way to go for India to 
achieve the announced net-zero goal 
and a significant effort will be needed 
from all stakeholders.

The road ahead

Across various estimates55, India’s 
real GDP is expected to grow at 
about five percent annually till 2050 
(Table 1). This would mean fourfold 
GDP growth for India over the next 
30 years. With this, demand growth 
across all sectors could multiply: 
power (quadruple), steel (quadruple), 
cement (triple), automotive (triple) and 
agricultural food production (double) 
(Exhibit 8). Based on the reduction 
in carbon intensity of GDP seen over 
the last decade, India’s annual GHG 
emissions will likely grow substantially 
from their current 2.9 GtCO₂e to 
11.8 GtCO₂e by 2070.56 With 75 percent 
of India yet to be developed by 2050, 
we are uniquely positioned among our 
global peers to build more sustainably 
(Exhibit 9).57 From our analysis, it 
appears that benefits to India of a well-
planned, orderly, accelerated transition 
would outweigh the downsides given 
India’s growth outlook. This would need 
that India take action within this decade 
to set things up. If it does so, India can 
use its growth momentum and build 
India right in the decades thereafter.

Our Methodology: what this 
report is and what it is not 
This report is a synthesis of a year-
long effort that included bottom-up 
modelling across six sectors (power, 
automotive, aviation, cement, steel 
and agriculture) and four cross-cutting 
enablers. We took a four-step approach 
for each sector:

 — Creating the baseline: 2019 was 
taken as the baseline year. We 
modelled emissions bottom-up 
based on India’s activity levels 
across sectors and corresponding 
emission intensities. Our findings 
were refined and syndicated to 
align with India’s submission to the 
UNFCCC.

 — Granular forecasting of demand: 
We used sector-specific sources 
and expert inputs to arrive at 
demand projections for each of the 
six sectors. Forecasts were aligned 
with expected GDP and population 
outlooks up to 2070.

 — Identifying optimal production 

and technology mix: We leveraged 
McKinsey’s decarbonisation lever 
repository and the Decarbonisation 
Scenario Explorer (DSE) tool to 
identify and model technological 
levers for production. Assumptions 
were modified for India based on 
inputs from industry experts as well 
as secondary sources.

 — Defining enablers and estimating 
implications of decarbonisation, 
including potential costs and 
benefits through bottom-up 
modelling for the six sectors 
using local and industry data. 
Assumptions were tested through 
50+ Indian and global expert 
interviews. The data points 
mentioned in the report are based 
on McKinsey’s Sustainability 
modelling framework unless 
mentioned otherwise.

In this report, we have assumed two 
potential pathway scenarios – LoS 
and Accelerated. The LoS scenario 

considers a phased adoption of 
decarbonisation levers, implementation 
of current policy announcements and 
predicted reduction of technology 
costs. Our Accelerated scenario 
considers faster adoption of 
decarbonisation levers and quicker 
reduction in technology costs. 
More importantly, it considers new 
regulations (like carbon price through 
an emission-trading scheme) and faster 
maturing of new technologies (e.g., 
CCS). Both these scenarios consider 
that India’s growth can happen along 
with progress on broader development 
imperatives while pursuing actions for 
emission abatement. Further, these 
scenarios have largely been estimated 
with currently feasible technologies. It 
is to be expected that India could get 
to its net-zero-by-2070 commitment 
through the upcoming technology 
developments over the next decades 
(e.g., direct air capture). More detailed 
assumptions made in each scenario are 
elaborated on next:

45

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthGreen hydrogen uptake is also 
accelerated, leading to faster 
adoption of green hydrogen-based 
steel-making technology and 
FCEVs in commercial vehicles by 
2050. This Accelerated scenario 
also assumes the adoption of 
future technologies that are not yet 
commercially viable, for example, 
CCS in industry. 

 — Policies: In addition to current and 
planned policies, the Accelerated 
scenario also assumes certain big 
policy moves that enable faster 
adoption of decarbonisation 
technologies including demand 
side signals such as extension of 
GST benefits and FAME subsidies 
for EVs until 2030, prioritisation of 
carbon neutral biomass as industrial 
fuel (e.g., for use in cement kilns), 
and mandated recycling and 
blending rates (50 percent recycled 
plastics in packaging, 100 percent 
use of bio-decomposer in paddy-
straw residue and 20 percent 
recycled concrete used as clinker 
substitute in cement). This scenario 
also assumes a carbon pricing of 
$50 / tCO₂ by 2030 in industries 
such as steel, which progressively 
increases. The establishment 
of a domestic carbon market 
is also assumed to enable the 
financing of green technologies 
and development of NCS that can 
generate carbon credits. 

The LoS scenario assumes continued 
demand and economic growth, 
with penetration of low-carbon 
technologies continuing at presently 
predicted rates. We consider a phased 
adoption of abatement levers in 
line with India’s net-zero 2070 goal, 
current policy announcements and 
currently estimated technology cost 
outlooks. The major assumptions in this 
scenario include:

 — Demand: Industrial production and 
consumer demand increase in line 
with GDP (five percent per annum 
from 2020–2050 and three percent 
per annum from 2050–2070) and 
population (0.5-one percent per 
annum) until 2070.59 Sustainable 
alternatives are adopted as per 
current policies and market outlook, 
e.g., continued uptake of renewable 
energy, steady increase in demand 
for EVs. The LoS scenario does 
not assume any externalities or 
interventions that shift or disrupt 
expected demand.

 — Technologies: Only currently 
available and feasible green 
interventions and technologies 
are assumed in this scenario. 
This includes renewable energy 
sources such as solar and onshore 
wind, battery electric vehicles 
(BEVs) for transport, and organic 
and nano-fertilisers in agriculture. 
Green fuels are used partially in 
industries like cement. A majority 
of steel production is assumed 
to continue with blast furnaces 
in the near future, with electric 
arc furnaces being adopted in 
line with scrap availability. Next-
horizon or less-economically-viable 
technologies like CCUS are not 
incorporated into this scenario. 
Other currently less feasible 
technologies, such as hydrogen 
in steelmaking or technologies to 
improve productivity in livestock, 
are assumed to be delayed and 
come into play only when they 
become economic.

 — Policies: Current policies, targets 
and planned policies are assumed 
to continue in this scenario. 
Existing policies on renewable 
energy capacity additions, coal 
phase-out targets and so on are 
assumed. Current EV policies and 
funding schemes such as FAME are 
incorporated. Government actions 
on sustainable farming, such as 
incentives on nano-fertilisers and 
forest conservation efforts are also 
expected to continue at historical 
rates. This scenario does not 
have any structural interventions 
aimed at creating green demand 
signals. For example, carbon 
pricing or premiums, domestic 
carbon markets, further blending 
or recycling mandates are not 
assumed in the LoS scenario.

The Accelerated scenario assumes 
adoption of decarbonisation levers at 
a much faster pace. It also takes into 
account the adoption of newer low-
carbon technologies across sectors 
and cross-cutting themes, investments 
in nascent technologies (e.g., CCUS) 
and new policy interventions aimed at 
accelerating decarbonisation  
(e.g., carbon markets). 

 — Demand: Economy and population 
grow at the same rates as LoS. In 
this scenario, however, there are 
also shifts in expected demand 
to decarbonised alternatives. 
20 percent of demand for cement, 
for example, is expected to shift to 
alternative construction materials 
by 2070.60 Likewise, consumption 
of rice is assumed to decline by 
30–40 percent and instead shift to 
alternative coarse cereals.

 — Technologies: Currently available 
technologies are assumed to be 
adopted at a much faster pace. 
Penetration of EVs, for example, 
reaches 95–100 percent by 
2050 instead of 2070 as in 
the LoS pathway. Renewable 
energy contributes to 95 percent 
of power generation by 2050.

readers gain an understanding of the 
scale of response needed to achieve 
sustainable growth over the next few 
decades. Furthermore, we hope that 
this report assists public and private 
sector leaders in setting and meeting 
their carbon emission reduction goals.

How to read this report 

The overall summary of our pathway 
modelling, from the primary abatement 
measures to the required redesign of 
the energy system, are discussed in this 
chapter (Chapter 1).

Each sector has a different starting 
point and faces unique challenges in its 
decarbonisation journey. We present 
the cost-optimal pathways for each 
sector in sector deep dives in Chapter 
2, and discuss the roles of hydrogen, 
CCUS, NCS and material circularity as 
cross-sector enablers in Chapter 3.

Accelerated decarbonisation by 2050 
would have significant socio-economic 
implications such as shifting land use, 
changes in energy mix, reskilling of 
the workforce, stranded assets and 
inflation impact on the poor. We discuss 
these implications in Chapter 4.

Financing the transition is a challenge 
for countries around the world and India 
is no different. We discuss the short- 
and long-term financing challenges 
and implications in Financing India’s 
decarbonisation in Chapter 5 and 
conclude with a proposed list of ten 
actions in Chapter 6. Finally, the 
appendix carries more details on our 
modelling approach, lists references 
and includes a glossary of terms.

Limitations 

While this report includes a thorough 
bottom-up analysis of key sectors and 
cross-cutting themes, it does have the 
following limitations:

 — The different sectoral and topic-
wise analyses do not take into 
account future technological 
breakthroughs (e.g., Direct Air 
Capture) or structural shifts (e.g., 
complete overhaul of food systems 
to vertical farming) that are not 
currently foreseen to be in the 
conversation. 

 — The modelling assumes tax 
structures, tariffs, subsidies 
as they are currently (e.g., on 
transportation fuels). It does not 
account for positive or negative 
social impact, transaction costs 
associated with switching to new 
technology, communication costs 
and administrative costs. All the 
analyses have been done in real

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth2. Sector deepdives

2.1  Power sector

50

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthKey actions that India could take 
to enable the transition would be 
a) increase RE and storage capacity 
additions; b) initiate market reforms, 
leverage innovative flexibility sources 
for RE-integration to ensure grid 
reliability; c) improve the financial 
health of power distribution 
companies (DISCOMs); and d) localise 
manufacturing in key technology 
areas such as solar, storage and 
hydrogen electrolysers. Besides the 
transition, decarbonisation could 
also help accelerate job creation and 
provide India with an opportunity to 
become a global leader of energy 
transition and a possible exporter 
of green technologies. However, 
India will have to be mindful not to 
compromise on energy security through 
import localisation and power-mix 
diversification.

This transition will likely need an 
investment of $2.5 trillion until 2050 
in the LoS scenario and an additional 
$1.3 trillion in the Accelerated scenario. 
Importantly, most of this investment 
is NPV positive and could get India’s 
power-generation cost from its current 
INR 4/kWh to INR 3/kWh by 2050. 
The total average system cost of supply 
which was 6.15 INR/kWh in 2020 can 
also come down by 0.7–0.9 INR/kWh 
as increases in per unit transmission 
and distribution cost could be offset 
by decreases in generation cost and 
aggregate, technical and commercial 
(AT&C) loss reduction.61 However, 
India would have to be mindful not to 
compromise on energy security through 
import localisation and power-mix 
diversification.

Critical challenges that India would 
face to achieve net-zero in the 
power sector are a) 5x and 9x RE 
capacity addition in 2030 and 2040, 
respectively relative to its current 
10–12 GW per year RE addition; b) 
RE supply chain and raw material 
manufacturing given 80–90 percent of 
solar modules are currently imported; c) 
land availability and grid connectivity; 
d) integration of intermittent RE while 
ensuring grid stability and avoiding 
power outages.

Key takeaways
The power generation sector 
accounts for 35 percent of India’s 
total emissions, which have grown at a 
CAGR of two percent in the last decade, 
in line with the demand growth of 
electricity. While India has taken steps 
toward decarbonising the sector by 
accelerating build-out of RE capacity 
over the past decade, challenges 
remain.

India could get to net-zero emissions 
by 2070 in our LoS scenario, 
supported by favourable economics 
(of RE and RE-storage hybrids vis-à-
vis coal), industry action, conducive 
policies and increasing investment 
(including from major global investors). 
We do not envisage accelerated 
retirement of coal-fired power plants in 
our scenarios—incremental demand for 
power would largely be met with non-
fossil sources of generation while the 
existing fleet of hyphenate plants would 
continue to operate (depending on their 
position in the merit order curve) until 
the end of their economic life.

India’s power sector could achieve 
net zero by 2050 in the Accelerated 
scenario by accelerating investment 
and undertaking market reforms. This 
will require around 1000 GW additional 
renewable capacity by 2050 and 
can result in avoiding a cumulative 16 
GtCO₂e of emissions by 2070. Sector 
emissions would peak by the mid- to 
late-2020s in this scenario.

offtake—have also attracted significant 
investment and enabled this shift. 

The power sector today

The power sector currently accounts 
for around 35 percent of India’s total 
carbon emissions. Between 2011 
and 2019, emissions increased from 
930 MtCO₂e to 1100 MtCO₂e—a 
CAGR of two percent,62 roughly half 
the electricity demand growth in the 
period.63 Demand for power is set to 
rise further as industry and transport 
electrify, increasing per capita 
consumption from the current relatively 
low levels of around 1,200 kWh, just 
one-seventh of the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) average.64 

Renewables are increasingly 
competitive against coal: Most of 
the emissions in the sector are from 
coal-based thermal power plants, 
which currently meet three-quarters 
of India’s power demand.65 However, 
the share of coal generation in the 
power generation mix peaked in 2015 
at 78 percent and has been declining 
since.66 This decline is driven primarily 
by exponential capacity growth in 
RE and its cost competitiveness 
(Exhibit 10). India is a global leader in 
RE development. In 2021, it had the 
world’s fifth-highest global solar-power 
capacity and fourth-largest global 
solar and wind capacity.67 Rapid cost

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthSolar tariffs in the range of INR 2–2.5/
kWh are cheaper than the marginal 
cost of 60–70 percent of coal power 
plants.69 Solar-wind-storage hybrid 
plants that provide 85 percent round-
the-clock power on an annual basis—a 
common definition of baseload RE in 
India—have ex-bus bar tariffs between 
INR 4–5/kWh. These RE-storage 
hybrids have reached parity with new-
build coal plants, and it is expected that 
they will be cheaper on a marginal cost 
basis than 30–50 percent of operating 
coal plants by 2030 and 60–75 percent 
by 2040 (Exhibit 11).70 

Net zero is possible, but challenges 
remain: Reaching net zero is possible 
in India only if the power sector builds 
on and accelerates its energy-transition 
momentum. We examine two scenarios 
for getting to net zero in the sector: 
the LoS scenario and the Accelerated 
scenario (Exhibit 12). Both are realistic 
and would bring great benefits. 
However, both scenarios would require 
substantial investment, and major 
challenges remain to be addressed—
primarily through market and  
policy reform.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthinter-state transmission charges and 
ambitious decarbonisation targets; a 
well-developed, mature power and RE 
industry; the presence of large global 
investors; and a growing trend among 
industrial consumers to decarbonise 
their power.

In this scenario, emissions may rise for 
another decade, as coal generation 
is expected to increase modestly to 
provide continuous power and balance 
the grid till RE-storage hybrid ramps 
up. Correspondingly, emissions would 
peak in the early 2030s at 1.3 GtCO₂e. 
Emission intensity would, however, 
gradually decrease from 0.77 kgCO₂e/
kWh in 2020 to 0.52 kgCO₂e/kWh by 
2030. This transition would be  
enabled by:

These challenges include but are not 
limited to the poor financial health 
of DISCOMs, power infrastructure 
upgrades to deal with infirm power, 
constraints in the RE supply chain and 
barriers to RE access for industrial 
consumers. The absence of ancillary 
and capacity markets in India shows 
that India’s market structures are still 
not ready to integrate large amounts of 
RE.71 The fact of a relatively young coal 
fleet (the average age of coal-powered 
plants is 14 years) will need to be kept in 
mind while developing India’s road map 
to net-zero emissions. 

The LoS scenario

It is feasible for India to achieve net-
zero emissions by 2070 in an LoS 
scenario. Several factors put India’s 
power sector on a strong footing 
to reach its decarbonisation goals: 
favourable economics; strong policy 
backing, including the waiver of 

 — Coal capacity: This is estimated to 
increase from its current 210 GW 
to peak at 240 GW by 2030, driven 
by the completion of major projects 
currently under construction or in 
advanced planning (Exhibit 14).72 
The LoS scenario assumes that 
there would be minimal to nil coal 
capacity addition after 2030—but 
also no forced plant retirements, 
as cheaper coal capacity could be 
maintained at an average plant load 
factor (PLF) of 60 percent.

 — Solar and wind capacity: This 

is expected to increase from the 
current 95 GW in 2021 to 300 
GW by 2030, with 20–25 GW 
built annually. This is achievable, 
considering India has succeeded 
in adding 10–12 GW per year over 
the past five years (excluding some 
periods affected by the COVID-19 
pandemic)73 and is further scaling its 
renewable capacity.

71  90 percent of power in India is still provided via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), the majority of which are for baseload. The share of wholesale or 

traded power, peak PPAs and shaped PPAs is very low. Time-of-day pricing, which is needed to achieve demand-side flexibility, is also not dynamic or adequate in 
many places.

72  Based on the McKinsey power model (detailed in the Box 1). Currently, 29 GW of coal power plant capacity is under construction and 20 GW of capacity is planned. 

By 2030, it is expected that 18 GW of coal power plants will be retired, which entails a net increase of 30 GW by 2030.

Exhibit 13

Key assumptions made in the LoS and Accelerated scenarios for power sector analysis.

LoS scenario

Accelerated scenario

• Demand growth of 5% till 2050 (including hydrogen 
demand); without hydrogen demand growth at 4% till 
2050

• Coal capacity increases from 210 GW currently to 
peak at 240 GW by 2030 driven by completion of 
plants which are under-construction and in advanced 
planning stage

• No accelerated decommissioning of coal plants, coal 
plants are retired when they reach their end of life 
(40-50 years)

• Wind and solar capacity addition assumed not to be 
constrained by land availability, equipment and other 
factors

• Nuclear capacity is assumed to increase from 7 GW in 
2021 to minimum 15 GW by 2030 and 20 GW by 
2040. Wind Offshore is assumed to reach 5 GW by 
2030, 15 GW by 2040 and 30 GW by 2050

• Higher demand growth rate of 6% till 2050 due 
to faster electrification of industry and transport

• No new coal plants built other than plants 

already under construction. Coal capacity peaks 
in mid-2020s, and is 190 GW in 2030

• Most coal plants become uneconomical by mid-
2040s and are retired. End of life for coal plants 
assumed to be 10 years less (30-40 years)

• Wind and solar capacity addition assumed not to 
be constrained by land availability, equipment 
and other factors

• Nuclear capacity is assumed to increase from

7 GW in 2021 to minimum 15 GW by 2030 and 
20 GW by 2040. Wind Offshore is assumed to 
reach 5 GW by 2030, 15 GW by 2040 and 30 
GW by 2050

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth — Enhanced storage and flexibility, 
where total storage could increase 
from its current operational 
capacity of 3.3 GW to 30 GW by 
2030, reaching 600 GW by 2050:74 
Until the mid-2030s, pumped 
hydro (6–24 hours of capacity) 
would continue to be the dominant 
storage technology as lithium-ion 
batteries (less than six hours of 
capacity) continue to scale. These 
existing storage technologies with 
technological improvements that 
could reduce Capex and increase 
efficiency would be sufficient to 
meet the sector’s needs for the 
next two decades. From 2040, 

as the RE share increases beyond 
60 percent, intermittent RE sources 
may require longer-duration storage 
technologies, such as hydrogen, for 
seasonal storage. 

 — Nuclear power: To maintain grid 
reliability as coal is phased out, 
we have assumed that nuclear will 
increase from its current levels of 
around 7 GW to at least 15 GW by 
2030 and around 20 GW by 2050; 
and offshore wind will increase to a 
minimum of 5 GW in 2030, 15 GW in 
2040 and 30 GW by 2050. India’s 
huge thorium reserves and long 
coastline mean that nuclear and 
offshore-wind power-generation 

technologies both have great 
potential to enhance grid reliability. 
If initial support is provided by 
the government in the form of 
feed-in tariffs or viability gap 
funding, offshore wind and new 
nuclear technology could become 
cost competitive and help India 
decarbonise even sooner.

The above capacity mix projection for 
the LoS scenario is also in line with 
India’s NDC commitment of achieving 
50 percent of installed power capacity 
from non-fossil fuel by 2030.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe Accelerated scenario
Given the rapid innovations in RE and 
acceleration in capital deployment, 
India has a unique opportunity to 
achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. 
This could be made possible by 
accelerating interventions to address 
industry challenges and instituting 
key market reforms to encourage 
further investment. Relative to the 
LoS scenario, net-zero emissions by 
2050 could prevent about 16 GtCO₂e 
of cumulative emissions by 2070, while 
only marginally increasing generation 
costs.75 In the Accelerated scenario, 
emissions could peak in the mid-
2020s at 1.3 GtCO₂e, following the 
coal-generation trajectory. Emission 
intensity would rapidly decrease to 
0.37 kgCO₂e/kWh by 2030. This would 
be enabled by:

 — High-cost coal capacity becoming 
increasingly uneconomical in 
comparison to the declining costs of 
solar or wind hybrids. Assuming no 
new coal plant would come online 
beyond current capacity, existing 
efficient low-cost coal plants may 
continue to generate power (PLFs 
of 60–65 percent) into the mid-
2040s. By 2050, the entire current 
coal fleet could expect to be retired.

 — Solar and wind capacity increasing 
to 480 GW by 2030—a 45 percent 
share of all power generation 
(Exhibit 15). This would need an 
acceleration in the annual build-
out to 40–50 GW (compared to 
10–12 GW per year over the past 
five years) till 2030. By 2050, India 
may likely need 2,700 GW of solar 
and wind, representing a 95 percent 
share of the generation mix.

 — Enhanced storage, which, along 
with hydro and coal reutilised as 
flexible generation sources, would 
be needed to balance the higher 
RE share. The amount of required 
storage would be 65 GW by 2030 
and 1,200 GW by 2050. Until mid-
2030, pumped hydro would be the 
key storage technology (for short- 
to medium-term storage) supported 
by lithium-ion batteries to provide 
baseload power—but from the 
late 2030s onward, long-duration 
energy storage technologies 
(including hydrogen) would be 
needed as seasonal storage.

 — Generation from nuclear, which 

is assumed to increase to around 
25 GW by 2030, remaining at this 
level until 2050. As with the LoS 
scenario, the share of offshore wind 
is assumed to gradually increase to 
reach 30 GW by 2050.

Achieving this scenario would require 
more intense and rapid efforts across 
four areas: 

1.  Accelerating India’s RE capacity: 
India would need to add 40–50 
GW of RE annually over the 
next decade and 130–140 GW 
annually from 2040 to 2050.76 
Associated challenges involving 
land acquisition, grid connectivity 
and counterparty risks (such as 
problems with PPA adoption, 
renegotiation and payment) would 
also have to be addressed. These 
issues are expected to multiply 
as RE scales up. For example, the 

2050 solar capacity of 2,000 GW is 
expected to require 1.3 percent of 
India’s land surface (about a quarter 
of India’s wasteland).

2.  Ensuring grid reliability and 

market reforms: India has limited 
flexible generation capacity 
compared to many other countries. 
Already, RE integration issues are 
emerging, leading to solar power 
curtailment and a slowing down 
in terms of signing new PPAs. For 
grid reliability with 90 percent RE, 
massive reforms are required in 
the power market. Currently, the 
wholesale market share is under 

ten percent; there is no ancillary 
services market; incentives for 
peak-load plants are inadequate; 
and time-of-day tariffs are limited.77 
As most of this RE capacity is likely 
to be in the south and west, the 
country will likely need to increase 
interconnection capacity. Finally, 
RE addition must be complemented 
by either 60–65 GW of storage 
(short and long duration) by 
2030 and 1,200 GW by 2050 or 
alternative flexibility mechanisms 
will need to be found.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthImplications of the transition 
to net zero for the power 
sector

Emissions: In the LoS scenario, power-
sector emissions are expected to peak 
by the early 2030s. In the Accelerated 
scenario, the peak could be reached 
by the mid-2020s (Exhibit 16). If India’s 
power-sector targets the Accelerated 
scenario instead of the LoS scenario, 
it could abate around 10 GtCO₂e 
emissions by 2050 and around 
16 GtCO₂e by 2070.78

3.  Ensuring financial viability of the 
distribution sector: Most public 
DISCOMs in India are lossmaking, 
leading to increased financial stress 
on power generators and reluctance 
to promote open access RE for 
commercial and industrial (C&I) 
customers. The financial health of 
DISCOMs would need to improve to 
be able to attract low-cost capital 
for the transition.

4.  Streamlining governance, policy 
making and planning: Multiple 
ministries are needed to enable the 
transition, and they may need to 
be aligned fully with this transition. 
Furthermore, coordination and 
policy cohesion between federal 
and state governments would be 
needed.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthInvestments: An investment of 
$1.3 trillion through to 2050 would be 
required for the LoS scenario to build 
RE, storage and distribution capacity. 
This represents an annual investment 
between $12 and $14 billion through 
to 2030, rising thereafter to between 
$70 and $80 billion per annum. This is 
realistic but challenging, considering 
that in 2021 India’s RE sector attracted 
$12–$15 billion in investment.79 
In addition, expanding and upgrading 
the transmission and distribution (T&D) 
infrastructure would need another 
$1.2 trillion. 

For the Accelerated scenario, an 
additional cumulative Capex investment 
of $750 billion would be needed for RE 
and storage capacity, and $550 billion 
for the transmission and distribution 
infrastructure through 2050 vis-à-vis 
the LoS scenario. The investments in 
RE and storage factor in reasonable 
improvements in the cost and efficiency 
expected over the next few years. 

Storage considers multiple 
technologies – lithium-ion, pumped 
hydro storage, other long duration 
energy storage technologies and 
hydrogen – based on the duration 
needed for storage. Investments in T&D 
infrastructure have been estimated 
based on their correlation with capacity 
additions and peak demand growth. 
These numbers have also been 
triangulated with forecasts by other 
agencies.80

are added to the generation cost to get 
the total system cost, the overall power 
costs will still decline, but not as steeply 
as the power generation cost by itself.

Generation cost: In both scenarios, 
the shift from thermal power to 
renewables is expected to decrease 
the average cost of generation, given 
the decreasing cost of RE and storage 
technologies (Exhibit 18). Even though a 
huge sum of investment is required for 
this transition, most of this investment 
would be NPV, reducing India’s power-

Imported equipment: India currently 
imports 80–90 percent of its solar 
modules, leading to an annual import 
bill of $5 billion to $10 billion (in 2021).82 
This could increase to $50 billion by 
2030 and $300 billion by 2050 in the 
LoS scenario, and increase to $120 
billion by 2030 and $450 billion by 
2050 in the Accelerated scenario. 
There is an ongoing race for raw 
materials for solar PV and storage 
(e.g., cobalt, rare earth metals). India 
has historically under-invested in R&D 
and innovation on alternative material 
science applications for technologies 
like solar PV and battery. To secure 
the future energy mix and make India a 
global green-energy hub, it will be vital 
to localise manufacturing.

Proposed enablers for power 
decarbonisation

Three enablers to be considered for the 
transition to net zero in India’s power 
sector: 

1.  Reducing land and grid 

2.  Accelerating power market 

bottlenecks for RE projects: A 
central RE infrastructure planning 
and project monitoring agency 
could be responsible for resolving 
the supply-side bottlenecks for 
RE projects. This agency could 
identify land pockets (especially 
wastelands) through geospatial 
analysis and satellite imaging; 
maintain a databank on available 
land with resource potential (which 
could also lower financing cost 
and promote insurance products); 
coordinate with bodies, such as 
the National Land Monetisation 
Corporation, the Department 
of Land Resources and state 
governments, to either aggregate 
land in a solar-park model or 
facilitate acquisition by private 
players. It would also coordinate 
with transmission companies to 
inform their capacity planning. 

reforms and DISCOM reforms 
to integrate RE and de-risk the 
sector: Such reforms would include 
deepening power markets with 
the introduction of derivatives and 
futures for risk mitigation, launching 
ancillary services and capacity 
markets, leveraging demand-
side flexibility by speeding the 
adoption of consumer time-of-day 
tariffs and EV charging. It would 
also include creating supply-side 
flexibility by enabling existing coal 
and hydro plants to blend RE into 
existing PPAs, and incentivising 
underutilised plants to participate 
in the capacity market. Market 
reform could save $150 billion to 
$200 billion in investments through 
2050, which have been built into our 
investment estimates.83 

82 
83 

 Trade statistics, Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. 
 These savings have been estimated assuming supply- and demand-side flexibility—for demand-side flexibility, McKinsey assumed that 15 percent of EV demand 
would shift to solar hours and 5 percent of residential demand would shift to solar hours through demand response. For supply-side flexibility, the higher ramp rates 
and lower technical minimum of coal plants, along with repurposing some hydro plants as flexibility providers, were considered.

63

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthNet zero in power is achievable if 
India acts fast.84 With policymakers, 
industry and companies facilitating RE 
integration into the grid (by building a 
flexible, robust grid and ensuring that 
conventional and storage technologies 
operate together), India could become 
a global energy-transition leader and 
an exporter of green technologies. 
Favourable RE economics can play 
a supportive role in this transition, 
attracting investments from the 
growing global pool of sustainability-
themed capital. Decarbonising India’s 
power sector would need significant 
investments, but can bring with it 
considerable opportunities, including 
that of global green energy leadership.

On the DISCOM side, India has already 
undertaken multiple efforts to reform 
the power-distribution sector. It can 
ensure strict monitoring and adherence 
to the recent revamped distribution 
sector scheme reforms, make 
lending to DISCOMs more stringent 
(including from private banks and 
financial institutions), strengthen the 
performance of regulators (for example, 
by ensuring timely and adequate tariffs) 
and encourage DISCOMs to create a 
roadmap for business transformation 
amenable to improving last mile 
delivery (quality/ reliability), customer 
service and competition. 

Furthermore, India could unlock latent 
C&I demand by removing barriers to 
open access (for example, through 
banking, net metering, inter-state 
open access and extension of the 
interstate transmission system {ISTS} 
charges waiver); promoting innovative 
contracting mechanisms (like virtual 
PPAs) to enable RE procurement 
for smaller C&I customers (less than 
100kW); reducing the financial impact 
on DISCOMs; improving the bankability 
of RE projects; and encouraging 
DISCOMs to launch green tariffs. 
It could also develop inter-country 
transmission networks in South Asia, 
Southeast Asia and eventually the 
Middle East to deepen the grid.

3. 

 Localising manufacturing and 
key technologies could be 
leveraged to further enable 
the transition by i) incentivising 
end-to-end manufacturing for PV 
modules, storage, electrolysers; ii) 
acquiring or developing upstream 
assets (such as lithium mines or 
polysilicon processing plants) to 
secure critical supply chains; iii) 
creating green innovation clusters 
consisting of academia, start-ups, 
incubators/ investors and industry 
players to lead R&D, prototyping 
and the scale-up of future energy 
technologies (e.g., off-river 
pumped storage, fuel cells, novel 
chemistries for storage, perovskite 
solar cells, thorium based nuclear, 
electrolysers) enabled by higher 
R&D spend by government and 
industry; iv) leveraging data stack, 
democratising data access and 
incentivising tech players to build 
AI/ ML solutions across the value 
chain (e.g., weather and generation 
forecasting, integrated resource 
planning and prescriptive models, 
predictive maintenance); v) training 
and reskilling power-sector 
employees for RE; and vi) enabling 
a circular economy by recycling 
and promoting second-life usage 
of batteries and PV modules for 
sustainability.

Modelling methodology:

For the power sector, the capacity 
and generation mix outlook has been 
prepared using a robust McKinsey 
proprietary power model. The least 
cost optimisation model is designed 
to develop an outlook on the capacity 
and generation mix such that the total 
system cost is minimised while reliably 
meeting constraints such as demand 
and emissions constraints. The model 
accounts for grid stability through 
matching demand and supply at hourly 
intervals for sampled days using a 
mix of 10+ generation and flexibility 

Exhibit 20

sources. 1000s of inputs are fed into 
the model, ranging from technological 
inputs such as choice of technology 
for generation and flexibility, capital 
and operating cost assumptions, 
generation profiles, efficiency and 
WACC for each technology along with 
inputs on demand outlook for each 
year, load profiles, current capacity mix 
with unit level details of existing power 
generation plants.

The analysis is carried out through a model which provides valuable insights for 
understanding the future supply/demand dynamics at a very granular level.

66

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe Accelerated scenario needs an 
incremental investment of $1.3 trillion 
till 2070, in addition to the $1.9 trillion 
needed for the LoS scenario. This 
would be for the higher upfront EVs 
cost for the customer, while automotive, 
battery makers and charging providers 
will need to invest less than they would 
for the equivalent ICE manufacturing 
capacity. Additionally, the government 
would need to re-balance its finances 
as fuel taxes, which currently amount 
to 14 percent of central government 
receipts at $50 billion (two percent of 
GDP), and will decline with faster EV 
penetration.87 

Key takeaways
Automotive tailpipe emissions 
account for 280 MtCO2e per annum 
(seven-eight percent of India’s total 
emissions), increasing at about six-
eight percent per annum85 due to a 
growing vehicle parc, increasing size 
of vehicle engines and also increasing 
average usage per vehicle. 

In the LoS scenario, the automotive 
sector could get to net-zero tailpipe 
emissions by 2070. Electrification 
of mobility is fast-accelerating due 
to advances in battery technology 
(storage capacity per kg up two times, 
average cost reduction of 17 percent 
every year over the last ten years). 
The sector benefits from government 
support (GST benefit of five percent 
on EVs versus 28–51 percent on 
ICE vehicles; dedicated FAME 
and PLI schemes).86 Perhaps the 
most important factor is an implicit 
carbon tax on transportation fuels of 
$140–240/tCO₂e. As a result, India 
can achieve almost net-zero tail pipe 
emissions by 2070 in the LoS scenario.

In the Accelerated scenario, the 
sector could get to near net zero by 
2050. In the Accelerated scenario, 
India can abate 95 percent of tail pipe 
emissions by 2050. This acceleration 
would come from a) reducing battery 
and fuel cell costs more quickly through 
at-scale localisation; b) providing 
continued government support through 
GST and FAME benefits till 2030; 
c) maintaining fossil fuel taxation at 
current levels; d) achieving the targeted 
modal mix of 45 percent for rail freight 
by 2040; and e) providing pointed 
affirmative action for transitioning to 
EVs for select ‘late-transition’ vehicle 
categories like HCVs.

The Accelerated scenario would 
result in an additional cumulative 
abatement of around ~7 GtCO2e 
till 2070 versus the LoS scenario. 
This would also save Forex on crude 
import of $900 billion till 2050 (net 
of battery material import), versus the 
LoS scenario. An accelerated transition 
presents India with an opportunity to 
become a global manufacturing base 
for select vehicle categories, e.g., e-two 
wheelers, e-three wheelers, e-SCVs.

The automotive sector today
Automotive tailpipe emissions, at 
280 MtCO₂e per annum, comprise 
seven to eight percent of the total 
carbon footprint of India, growing 
at six to eight percent annually, with 
scope 3 (tailpipe emissions) far higher 
than scope 3 (upstream materials used 
in the car), scope 2 (fuel value chain) 
and scope 1 (vehicle manufacturing) 
emissions (Exhibit 21).

The sector has been on the path of 
energy and carbon efficiency through 
measures like light-weighting (ten 
percent weight reduction improves 
mileage by six to eight percent), 
advanced combustion technologies and 
engine hybridisation. The government 
has also put in place regulations 
that reduce emissions by bringing in 
Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
(CAFE) norms that started with 

passenger cars and are extending to 
CVs and other categories.88 Yet, these 
interventions provide only marginal 
improvements. 

The shifting demand to larger cars and, 
hence, engines (e.g., share of entry-
level hatchbacks has dropped from over 
60 to 40 percent over the last eight-
nine years)89 and the growing parc (from 
290 million today to over 700 million 
by 2050)90 will lead to emission growth. 
In the internal combustion engine 
world, tailpipe emissions could rise to 
800 MtCO₂e annually by 2050.

As with the rest of our analysis, this 
chapter examines two scenarios for 
getting to net-zero tailpipe emissions — 
the LoS scenario and the Accelerated 
scenario.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe LoS scenario
Electrification is changing the face of 
mobility globally, with EV share gains 
accelerating in early adopter markets 
like China, the EU and US. These 
regions expect complete electrification 
of new car sales by 2030–2035 
(Exhibit 22).

These trends are playing out in India 
as well, leading to the increasing 
competitiveness of EVs vis-à-vis 
ICE vehicles.

1.  Battery and fuel cell technology 
advancements and the associated 
cost decrease (Exhibit 23), which 
is making EVs competitive on a 
lifetime cost basis (TCO).

2.  Implicit carbon taxes on 

transportation fuels in the form 
of central and state VAT and 
excise duties. For example, these 
amount to 35–45 percent of the 
petrol retail price in Delhi and 
translate to an implicit carbon tax 
of $140–240/tCO₂e for usage of 
petrol, depending on the crude oil 
price and prevailing rates of taxes 
(Exhibit 24).

3.  Upfront fiscal support being 

provided by the government in the 
form of GST benefits (five percent 
for EVs versus 28–51 percent for 
ICE vehicles) and FAME benefits 
(e.g., for two-wheelers, at the rate of 
INR 15,000/kWh of battery pack).91

Currently, the EV cost difference versus ICE vehicles is substantial which is a big deterrent to EV adoption. But due to 
the factors previously mentioned and their continuous favourable movement, the payback of owning an EV versus an ICE 
passenger car would reduce from nine years today to less than four by 2040 (Exhibit 25).

Based on these strong enabling 
forces, two- and three-wheeler sales 
are expected to be fully electric by 
2040. Passenger cars, which require 
relatively larger battery sizes, could 
see an inflection point in electrification 
around 2030 when battery costs go 
below $100 / kWh and the charging 
network develops at scale. Medium 
and heavy commercial vehicles (MCVs 
and HCVs) including inter-city buses 
will most likely take the fuel-cell way to 
electrify (FCEV) as batteries typically 
create dead weight and reduce carrying 

capacity. For mass adoption of the 
FCEV technology, the fuel cell cost 
would have to come down to $60–70 / 
kW and at-nozzle hydrogen cost to less 
than $3 / kg by 2050, which is likely to 
happen only in the 2040s. Hence, the 
electrification of MCVs and HCVs is 
going to be slower than all other vehicle 
types with 100 percent new vehicle 
electrification likely only post-2055 
(Exhibit 27).

This will mean that the full parc of 
vehicles would be 95 percent electric 
by 2070. Additionally, increase in 
rail share of freight – from about 25 
percent currently to 45 percent by 
2050, driven by initiatives like the 
dedicated freight corridors – has the 
potential to reduce CV demand by half 
a million, leading to further abatement. 
This leads to net-zero automotive 
tailpipe emissions by 2070 in our LoS 
scenario (Exhibit 28).

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThese new vehicle sales trajectories, 
along with useful life cycles of the 
existing and new ICE vehicles sold, 
would mean the full parc of vehicles 
reaches 90 percent electrified by 
2050, leading to near net-zero tailpipe 
emissions by 2050 (Exhibit 30).

Investments would be needed 
for the abatement scenarios 
Interestingly, in a rapidly growing 
automotive market, trucks will decline 
with higher EV penetration, given the 
lower capital intensity of EVs and their 
supply chains (Exhibit 31). 

The Accelerated scenario
If India accelerates interventions to 
address adoption challenges and drives 
reforms to encourage investments, 
along with targeted affirmative actions, 
near net-zero tail-pipe emissions may 
be possible by 2050. In this scenario, 
EV penetration growth could be higher 
across all categories of vehicles and 
reaching 100 percent EV sales by 2035 
for two- and three-wheelers, 2045 for 
cars and 2050 for heavy commercial 
vehicles (Exhibit 29).

Opex savings of $3.7 trillion in the

However, the EV customer will need

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthAccelerated scenario: benefits
Accelerated transition to electric 
vehicles will unlock several benefits: 

 — Earlier peak and lower emissions. 
The automotive emissions peak 
around 2040 in the LoS scenario 
and get to net zero by 2070. In the 
Accelerated scenario, the peak 
comes around 2030, followed by 
reduction and near net-zero CO₂ 
emissions by 2050 (Exhibit 34). 
This would mean a cumulative delta 
abatement of 7 GtCO₂e from now till 
2070 in the Accelerated versus the 
LoS scenario. 

 —  Reduced import dependence for 

fuel and associated Forex savings. 
India imports oil worth about $100 
billion currently. Relative to the LoS 
scenario, the Accelerated scenario 
saves $1.2 trillion till 2050 and 
$2 trillion till 2070 in Forex for oil. 
Netting off battery and battery 
material imports, which are higher 
in the Accelerated scenario, would 
still lead to substantial savings — 
$0.9 trillion till 2050, $1.7 trillion in 
savings till 2070 (Exhibit 35).

 — Lower obsolescence. Faster 

transition to electrified mobility 
would also mean less Capex 
investment in older technology 
leading to lower obsolescence. 
Additionally, the EV manufacturing 
footprint is less Capex intensive 
(about 50 percent lower), making 
India’s manufacturing capital more 
productive (Exhibit 31).

 — Path for a global play. In the 

Accelerated scenario, the Indian 
automotive industry can reimagine 
its global play. India is already 
exporting a large volume of two-
wheelers (25 percent of production; 
4 million units) and three-wheelers 
(over 60 percent of production, 0.5 
million units)92 and can leverage this 
disruption to lead the change to EVs 
and take a leadership position in 
India-similar export markets (e.g., 
Africa, LatAm, SE Asia). Significant 
upheaval in global trade led by 
changing geopolitics presents 
the perfect opportunity for Indian 
vehicle manufacturers to scale their 
global ambitions.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth — Continued stimulus, in the form of 
fossil fuel taxes, GST benefits and 
the FAME subsidy until at least 
2030; and potentially extending 
the FAME subsidy to vehicle 
categories where it is not available 
like passenger cars (Exhibit 36). 
Additionally, scrappage benefits 
especially when the replacement 
vehicle is an EV, along with strict 
enforcement of vehicle age norms, 
can help a faster turnover of existing 
parc into EVs.

 — Investments to support build out of 
enabling charging infrastructure, 
through the government’s own 
investment, Capex subsidy for first 
installers, etc.

 — Initiatives that accelerate transition 
of road freight toward electrified-
rail freight (e.g., DFCs) could need to 
be fast-tracked to get to the target 
rail share of 45 percent by 2040.

 — Targeted affirmative actions on 

hard-to-abate segments like HCVs.

Much like the power sector, the 
automotive sector has great 
tailwinds and a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity for Indian automotive 
companies to seize the initiative and 
lead the sector in the region and 
globally. However, to make this a reality 
will require the support of multiple 
stakeholders, the right policy initiatives, 
infrastructure support and investment 
in technology / manufacturing 
localisation.

Proposed enablers for 
automotive decarbonisation
These enablers include:

 — At scale and fast localisation of 

battery giga-factories, with the best 
cost curves achieved around seven 
to ten years earlier, i.e., $70–75 / 
kWh by 2030 and $55–60 / kWh 
by 2040; along with investment in 
new technologies like solid-state, 
sodium-ion.

 — Lower hydrogen fuel cell costs, 
which are essential for large CV 
electrification through FCEV 
technology, as well as making sure 
that hydrogen is competitive and 
widely available. The trajectory of 
this would need to be accelerated 
by ten years – to get to $60–70 / 
kW fuel-cell cost and at-nozzle 
hydrogen prices less than $3 / kg 
by 2035.

82

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThere will be benefits to accelerating 
the transition. These include increased 
farmer income (INR 2400/ha/year by 
selling agriculture residue), decreased 
amounts of MSW ending up in landfills, 
reduced import bills ($210 million96 
annually saved by blending ten percent 
SAF97) and an increase in jobs created 
due to the SAF ecosystem (segregation 
systems and manufacturing). 
Furthermore. after meeting its future 
blending requirements, surplus SAF 
can be exported ($13.55 billion in 
revenue from 5.5 Mnt98 SAF exported 
annually).

Biomaterials will need to be made 
preferentially available for SAF 
and bio-feedstock production will 
need to be scaled up. Apart from 
favourable policies to appropriately 
direct biomaterials for SAF use, 
infrastructure would need to be built 
for agricultural and forest residue 
collection, segregating MSW at source, 
and producing SAF. Additionally, policy 
measures, such as mandatory blending 
requirements, may also help unlock 
demand. 

Key takeaways
Aviation accounts for small but 
growing emissions. Aviation accounts 
for roughly five percent of the transport 
sector’s overall emissions. These 
emissions are expected to increase as 
demand for air travel continues to rise 
at three and a half percent per annum 
over the next 50 years and could grow 
from 16 MtCO2e93 per annum in 2019 to 
126 MtCO₂e94 per annum by 2070. 

It is a hard-to-abate sector 
as the technologies needed for 
decarbonisation, such as electric 
aviation and hydrogen-powered jets, 
are in a nascent stage of development. 
The most feasible abatement option, 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), faces 
feedstock constraints for scaling 
up production. In fact, directing 
scarce biomaterials to SAF might be 
better than using these for surface 
transportation, where electrification is 
an economic option. 

Emissions halve in the LoS scenario 
to around 63 MtCO2e95 by 2070 
with phased adoption of SAF (from 
ten percent blending in 2030 to 
50 percent in 2070). 

Emissions halve in the Accelerated 
scenario by 2050, if 50 percent 
blending is achieved in 2050, leading to 
cumulative abatement of 260 MtCO2e 
by 2050 (relative to LoS). This is 
through the increased use of municipal 
solid waste (MSW) for SAF, with the 
assertion that domestic and export SAF 
is the highest value use for MSW.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe aviation sector today
Currently, aviation is not a significant 
contributor to India’s emissions, 
accounting as it does for five percent of 
emissions from the mobility sector and 
half a percent of India’s total emissions. 
However, these are expected to grow 
rapidly to net-GHG emissions of around 
126 MtCO₂e per annum by 2070 
(around six percent of overall emissions 
in the LoS scenario). Additionally, 
emissions from the aviation sector 
have an impact that is two to three 
times greater on the environment than 
do emissions from road transport due 
to the additional non-CO₂ pollutants 
directly released by them.99 Hence, 
decarbonisation of India’s aviation 
sector is crucial. 

Furthermore, global mandates on the 
sector mean that action will need to 
be taken immediately if penalties or 
expenses on carbon credits are to 
be avoided. For instance, the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for 
the Indian aviation sector’s (CORSIA) 
offsetting requirements (mandatory 
second phase for all member states) 
will be applicable for all Indian airline 
operators from 2027.100 Aero turbine 
fuel (ATF) is currently priced at $1003/
ton versus likely SAF costs of $1800/
ton101 (no producer margin or taxation 
component included) (Exhibit 37). With 
blending mandates, additional costs of 
$1.8 to 1.9 per typical domestic flight 
(10 to 50 percent blend range) would 
need to be passed on to the consumer 
(Exhibit 38). 

 WEF clean sky initiative; Transport environment.

99 
100   CORSIA offers a harmonised way to reduce emissions from international aviation while respecting the status of member states. It is voluntary for organisations till 

2027. However it will become mandatory for all organisations from, 2027 onwards. “Measures taken to address CO₂ emissions from Civil Aviation,” Press Information

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe LoS scenario
SAF is the only realistic option if the 
sector has to be decarbonised in the 
next 10–15 years. SAF is a synthesis 
of renewable feedstocks, such as 
organic municipal waste, agricultural 
and forestry residues, and can be 
used as a fuel by the current aircraft 
fleet (certified to run up to 50 percent 
SAF).103 Electric planes (limited by 
battery weight – 50 kg of battery 
replaces 1 kg of liquid fuel) and 
hydrogen-powered aircrafts have not 
been commercialised yet.

SAF can be produced using four kinds 
of feedstock: agricultural residue, 
municipal solid biowaste, sugar steams 
and residue lipids (used cooking oil). 
Agricultural residue and municipal solid 
biowaste are best suited as feedstock 
for SAF (with a combined potential of 
around 9 Mt per annum in LoS versus 
14 Mt per annum in the Accelerated 
scenario, Exhibit 39). Sugar stream is a 
less feasible option and would compete 
with food sources. Collection of waste

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThis scenario assumes an SAF 
blending ratio of 50 percent by 2070 
and the implementation of CORSIA. 
In this scenario, with an assumed 
cost reduction of 20 percent, SAF 
will continue to remain uncompetitive 
against ATF in 2050. This limits 
domestic SAF demand to future 
blending mandates, providing India 
with the opportunity to export its SAF 
surplus of around 5 Mt per annum for 
three decades before its own demand 
catches up (Exhibit 40). 

The Accelerated scenario
In the Accelerated scenario, India 
could potentially reduce 50 percent 
of the aviation sector’s emissions by 
2050 and continue as a net exporter 
of SAF (with an SAF surplus of around 
5.5 Mt per annum, Exhibit 41), leading 
to annual emissions abatement of 
267 MtCO2e by 2050. In this scenario, 
we assume 7 Mt per annum of SAF 
production from municipal waste 
(relative to 1.8 mt in LoS).

Agricultural residue for SAF is assumed 
to be capped since it would compete 
with other hard-to-abate sectors such 
as cement. Limited segregation at 
source for MSW also constrains SAF 
production. The higher value of SAF 
could catalyse waste collection systems 
for MSW, not only serving the aviation 
section but also reducing landfills while 
enhancing municipal incomes.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthto SAF stakeholders could spur 
the growth of the supply chain, 
especially for waste segregation.

While aviation can appear a hard-
to-abate sector, the opportunity to 
innovate around SAF production using 
biomaterials provides a real opportunity 
to decarbonise a large part of the 
sector while continuing to innovate 
around new aviation technologies that, 
while not existing today, might emerge 
in the future, to ensure the sector can 
reach net zero.

Investment would be needed
In the Accelerated scenario, production 
of SAF to maximum potential 
would require a total investment of 
$347 billion by 2050, which is almost 
one-and-a-half- times the expected 
investment in the LoS scenario 
(Exhibit 42).

Proposed enablers for 
aviation decarbonisation
Considerations could be given to 
policy settings that encourage 
use of SAF over other uses of 
biomaterials in sectors where there 
are better abatement options (e.g., 
electrification is a real option for 
surface transportation, but there are 
no other options for aviation). Although 
technologies for SAF production exist, 
these need scaling and feedstock 
would need to be unlocked by:

 — Setting up the end-to-end 
infrastructure required for 
aggregating agricultural wastes and 
residue, and segregating MSW at 
source;

 — De-risking investment in the first 
wave of SAF production scale-up 
by providing investment support or 
appropriate viability gap funding;

 — Potentially extending the National 

Policy on Biofuels 2018 to introduce 
a blending mandate for SAF and 
other supportive policies (e.g., 
reduced taxation in line with other 
biofuels); 

 — Categorising the SAF industry as a 
priority sector which qualifies it for 
an array of benefits. Institutes such 
as the National Bank for Agriculture 
and Rural Development are already 
providing concessional soft loans,104 
extending comparable schemes

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth2.4   Cement sector

90

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe Accelerated scenario will likely 
require $351 billion more in Capex 
investment than the LoS scenario 
by 2070. Acceleration could also see 
cumulative Opex savings of $118 billion 
more than the LoS scenario by 2070, 
due to lean design, higher clinker 
efficiency and use of green fuels and 
refuse derived fuel (RDF) from waste at 
lower costs than fossil fuels.

Key takeaways
Cement accounts for about five 
percent of India’s current emissions 
(156 MtCO₂e in 2019) and is among 
the hardest sectors to abate, since 
two-thirds of the carbon emissions 
are from the separation of CO₂ from 
limestone, while a third are from the use 
of fossil fuels.105 Without any proactive 
abatement initiatives, emissions will 
likely grow with cement demand at 
2.1 percent per annum, leading to 
annual emissions of 431 MtCO₂e by 
2070. On top of this, an additional 
annual 93 MtCO₂e could be emitted 
due to higher clinker use driven by a 
diminishing supply of fly ash and slag 
from the coal-based power plants and 
steel sectors, increasing total emissions 
to 524 MtCO₂e by 2070.

In the LoS scenario, emissions can be 
reduced to 378 MtCO₂e per annum 
by 2070, if the industry can find other 
clinker substitutes and adopt carbon-
neutral biofuels (to meet 40 percent 
heat demand versus the current three 
percent).106 There are very few other 
levers in the LoS scenario which are 
cost competitive or are currently 
technically feasible at scale.

In the Accelerated scenario, absolute 
emissions could be reduced to 
88 MtCO₂e per annum by 2050 and 
remain at similar levels till 2070. CCUS, 
accelerated adoption of biomass-
based fuels (to meet 70 percent 

heat demand), increased adoption of 
clinker substitutes (such as recycled 
concrete) and lean design could 
reduce the emission intensity of the 
industry from its current 0.54 tCO₂/
ton cement to 0.13 tCO₂/ton cement by 
2050. The Accelerated scenario would 
have a cumulative abatement that is 
9.5 GtCO₂e more than the LoS scenario 
by 2070.

Levers corresponding to 45 percent 
of abatement in the Accelerated 
scenario also save cement 
production costs and help supply a 
growing demand for green cement.107 
With growing sustainable architecture 
and green building practices in 
construction, new green business 
opportunities (such as disassembly 
focused concrete blocks and green 
cement) and new business models (like 
green concrete) could also emerge. 
Abatement of the remaining 55 percent 
of emissions in the Accelerated 
scenario would likely require policy and 
technology enablers like carbon pricing 
and improved capture technologies 
to encourage CCUS. Policy enablers, 
including preferential allocation of 
biomass for cement and green cement-
blending mandates, may also be 
needed to drive clinker substitutes and 
green fuels. Achieving decarbonisation 
will likely require additional technology 
breakthroughs, such as renewables-
powered electric kilns and carbon 
storage in saline aquifers.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe cement sector today
Concrete is the second-most 
consumed product globally after 
potable water.108 Given its performance 
characteristics and the broad 
availability of limestone, cement (and 
therefore concrete) will remain the 
construction material of choice globally. 

Currently, cement accounts for roughly 
five percent of India’s emissions.109 
However, it is a particularly hard 
sector to abate, given the processes 
involved in cement production. Two-
thirds of the emissions from cement 
are from the clinker manufacturing 
processes110 for which there are 
currently no straightforward solutions 
for abatement. 

Considering the Indian cement sector 
performs better than global sector 
averages on clinker ratios (65 percent 

in India versus more than 70 percent 
globally)111 and energy efficiency (due 
to younger cement plants), traditional 
levers alone will not be sufficient to 
decarbonise fully and, therefore, we 
would need to innovate beyond these 
levers to achieve net zero in this sector.

The LoS scenario
Emissions are expected to increase 
with demand for cement and remain in 
line with GDP growth till 2035, tracking 
the population growth rate till 2070 and 
leading to an average annual growth of 
2.1 percent over this duration. This could 
lead to a cement demand of 814 Mt per 
annum by 2070, compared to 289 Mt 
in 2019, and a per capita consumption 
of between 350kg and 370kg by 2070 
from its per capita consumption of 209 
kg in 2019.112

Decarbonisation of the power and steel 
sectors would reduce the availability 
of clinker substitutes (fly ash and slag). 
In the absence of sufficient clinker 
substitutes like pozzolan and calcined 
clay, clinker use could grow, increasing 
the cost of cement by $70/ton to $75/
ton by 2050 (around a 30 percent cost 
increase) and emissions by 0.55 tCO₂/
ton of clinker (a 93 MtCO₂e per annum 
increase by 2070).113 

Without a concerted effort, therefore, 
annual cement emissions could grow 
from 156 MtCO₂e in 2019 to 524 
MtCO₂e by 2070. However, there is an 
opportunity to reduce annual emissions 
to 378 MtCO₂e through low-cost 
decarbonisation levers, as detailed next 
(Exhibit 43):

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThese levers could reduce cement’s 
emission intensity by 27 percent, from 
0.64 tCO₂/ton of cement in 2019 to 
0.47 tCO₂/ton of cement in 2070.

Moreover, the cement industry 
could convert this challenge of 
reducing emissions into a green 
business opportunity by leveraging 
the evolving green building 
practices in construction. With the 
growing adoption of green building 
certifications in India, such as the Indian 
Green Building Council and Leadership 
in Energy and Environmental Design, 
there is a shift in the Indian construction 
industry toward sustainable design.114 

State governments provide 
expedited environmental clearance 
to construction projects with green 
building certifications, and capital 
can be raised at better interest rates 
for construction projects with lower 
emissions.115 As a result, there has been 
a 37 percent increase in green certified 
buildings in the past five years.116 
Sustainable design, use of recycled 
raw materials (10 percent for one point 
and 20 percent for two points) and 
lean designs are some of the criteria 
included in these certifications.117 

As a result of these actions, absolute 
annual emissions in the LoS scenario 
could increase from 156 MtCO₂e in 
2019 to 378 MtCO₂e by 2070 (versus 
the possibility of 524 MtCO₂e).

 — Adopting green fuels such as 

biomass to replace fossil fuels like 
coal and pet coke. Alternative fuels, 
such as carbon-neutral biomass 
and RDF, could supply 40 percent 
of the heat demand from cement 
kilns by 2070, up from the current 
three percent. For example, using 
the biomass recovered from crop 
residue from up to 50 kilometers 
around cement plants and utilising 
RDF from surrounding towns 
and cities could lead to an annual 
reduction in energy emissions from 
the sector of 52 MtCO₂e by 2070.

 — Maintaining the clinker-to-cement 
ratio at the current level of 65 
percent by sourcing alternatives to 
fly ash and slag, like pozzolan and 
calcined clay. The industry may 
need to explore multiple options 
for clinker substitutes to meet the 
gap created by curtailed fly ash 
and slag supplies. This would also 
help maintain cement production 
costs, since clinker manufacturing is 
usually more expensive than clinker 
substitutes. With the continued use 
of gypsum to constitute five percent 
of cement, clinker substitutes of 
pozzolan and calcined clay could 
be increased. However, this would 
not be sufficient to close the gap 
created by the reduction in supply of 
fly ash and slag. Other options could 
be recycled concrete paste and bio-
ash (like rice-straw ash, rice-husk 
ash and bagasse ash). This would 
likely come at a higher cost initially 
but as the material circularity 
infrastructure matures, these could 
present cost-saving opportunities.

The Accelerated scenario
Accelerated decarbonisation of the 
cement industry would require the 
intense application of four levers 
that could drive the reduction in 
emissions to 88 MtCO₂e by 2050 and 
to 84 MtCO₂e by 2070 (Exhibit 44). 
Cumulative emissions in the scenario 
would be 9.5 GtCO₂e lower than in the 
LoS scenario by 2070.

1.  Adopting lean construction 
design and using alternative 
materials: Accelerated adoption of 
green building norms, alternative 
materials and sustainable 
architecture could lead to the 
optimised use of cement in 
construction. This has already 
begun, albeit on a small scale, and 
is likely to continue increasing 
considering the fast-paced growth 
certified green buildings have seen 
in the last five years.118 The Global 
Cement and Concrete Association 
(GCCA) estimates that there could 
be up to a 22 percent reduction 
in emissions through efficiency 
in design and construction.119 In 
India, demand for cement could 
be about 15 percent lower in 2050 
(21 percent in 2070) versus the LoS 
scenario if innovative construction 
methods, such as lean design, 
are adopted. This could lead to an 
annual emission reduction of 40 
MtCO₂e by 2050 and 64 MtCO₂e 
by 2070 (Exhibit 45). This reduction 
could also create adjacent business 
opportunities for the use of cement 
by diversification into alternative 
materials such as disassembly-
focused concrete blocks and 
recycled concrete-based 
aggregates.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthnorms).120 Cement produced with 
recycled concrete paste as a clinker 
substitute is commercially available 
in the European Union since 
2021–2022.121 Adoption of these 
technologies in India, combined 
with the availability of C&D waste, 
could drive recycled concrete 
paste as a clinker substitute. This 
would require rapid improvements 
in C&D waste recovery and 
recycling (75 percent would need 
to be recycled by 2070) as well as 
potential Capex investments at the 
cement plants.122 

Increasing the use of bio-ash 
could also help reduce the clinker-
to-cement ratio. Availability of 
bio-ash would need to be ensured 
through blending mandates and 
policy design like fly ash and slag 
use policies, with bio-ash collection 
from sugar mills, etc.

3.  Increasing the use of alternative 

fuels could potentially replace fossil 
fuels in cement kilns (Exhibit 48) 
and help reduce emissions by 45 
to 50 MtCO₂e per annum by 2050 
(with reduction continuing at a 
similar pace thereafter till 2070).123 
While this is technically feasible 
even today, costs and availability 
of alternative fuels is a challenge. 
While alternative fuels could 
potentially increase cumulative 
costs by $15 billion by 2070 in the 
Accelerated scenario compared to 
fossil fuel use in the LoS, they would 
also ensure that cost fluctuations 
were a thing of the past because 
of the price changes of coal and 
pet coke and dependence on fuel 
imports. The alternative fuels could 
include: 

2.  Reducing the clinker-to-cement 
ratio to 60 percent by 2070 versus 
its current levels of 65 percent 
could reduce emissions by 22 
MtCO₂e per annum. Moreover, 
clinker substitutes could also help 
save costs as they tend to be less 
expensive than clinker. A faster 
adoption of clinker substitutes 
could potentially save up to $15 / 
ton cement and thus add value to a 
growing green cement opportunity 
(Exhibit 46).

With a faster reduction in fly ash and 
slag supply, accelerated adoption of 
innovative clinker substitutes would 
be needed (Exhibit 47).

Accelerating the adoption 
of recycled concrete paste 
through improved circularity 
of construction and demolition 
(C&D) waste could achieve up 
to a 20 percent reduction in the

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthImplications of the 
Accelerated scenario
The Accelerated scenario would need a 
total Capex investment of $446 billion 
from 2020–2070. Of this investment, 
$387 billion would likely be required 
by 2070 for the CCUS set up (for 
capture, transportation and storage), 
with cumulative Opex costs of $162 
billion by 2070. A Capex investment of 
$59 billion would be needed by 2050 
for greenfield cement plants to meet 
incremental demand in this scenario. 
However, the greenfield investment 
would be $36 billion less than in the 
LoS scenario due to optimised cement 
demand through lean design levers. 
These Capex investments can be front 
loaded, with more than 70 percent of 
the capital investment needed by 2040 
in the Accelerated scenario (Exhibit 49). 

 — Carbon-neutral green fuels, such 
as agricultural waste, crop residue 
and bagasse, to meet 70 percent of 
heat demand. Between 45 Mt and 
50 Mt of crop residue annually may 
be needed by 2070 to meet this 
demand and would likely require 
collection of crop residue from 
farmers up to 100 km away (500 
Mt of crop residue is generated 
annually in India currently). 

 — Use of RDF from municipal solid 
waste, as well as plastic, tyre and 
other waste material. About 30–40 
Mt of RDF may be needed annually 
by 2070. 

 — Other potential fuels that could be 

used as green fuels for cement kilns 
including green hydrogen and other 
biofuels (e.g., algae-based biofuels) 
which are in a nascent stage of 
development and are not included in 
our calculations.

4.  Adopting new CCUS technologies 
may be necessary for capturing 
65 percent of the remaining 
emissions and abating about 

Exhibit 49

160 MtCO₂e per annum by 2070. 
However, this would require 
extensive investment in carbon-
capture set ups at cement plants, 
as well as in the utilisation, 
transportation and storage of 
the captured carbon. Among the 
carbon-capture technologies 
available, amine scrubbing is the 
primary technology in use today. 
However, there are multiple 
carbon-capture technologies 
being developed that may have 
lower costs than the primary 
industry pathway today. The set 
up for CCUS infrastructure in 
India, potentially a hub model, may 
require support in terms of policy, 
regulations and investments in 
pipeline infrastructure for CO₂ 
transportation, and exploration for 
new storage potential. Part of the 
captured carbon could be utilised 
in the cement industry for carbon-
cured concrete, artificial limestone 
and other applications. However, 
the technological and economic 
feasibility of these need to be 
established first. 

The Accelerated scenario may require Capex investments of $446 billion but produce net 
Opex savings of $118 billion by 2070.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe Accelerated scenario will likely 
incur an incremental CCUS Opex of 
$162 billion by 2070, but also create 
savings of $288 billion by 2070, 
creating net Opex savings of $118 billion 
by 2070. These savings will be the 
result of optimised cement demand, 
increased adoption of alternative fuels 
and improved clinker efficiency. 

With a shift toward sustainable 
architecture and green building 
practices, there could be an 
opportunity to drive green premia via 
green cement and adjacent products, 
such as green concrete, recycled 
aggregates and disassembly focused 
concrete blocks.124 For instance, 
clinker-free cement in France is 
currently leveraging a green premium 
of 30–40 percent compared to average 
conventional cement prices, although 
this is still on a small scale.125

Due to higher overall investments in the 
Accelerated scenario compared to the 
LoS scenario, cement costs are likely 
to increase by three to five percent, 
leading to a one to one-and-a-half 
percent increase in construction costs. 

Proposed enablers for cement 
decarbonisation
Achieving the Accelerated scenario 
would require investment from various 
stakeholders in the cement industry, 
policy, investment and technology 
enablers

1. 

 Policy enablers for consideration for 
accelerating the transition include:

•  Blending mandates, which 

could help the decarbonisation 
transition in cement manufacture. 
Such policies might include 
blending mandates for recycled 
concrete as clinker substitutes 
of up to 20 percent by weight of 
cement, or the mandated use of 
bio-ash as a clinker substitute.

building certifications. This 
could be especially useful for 
high-cost decarbonisation levers 
like CCUS and could incentivise 
investments.

•  Construction and demolition 
waste management policy 
enforcement, which, in addition 
to blending mandates, could drive 
circularity in cement.

2. 

Investment will be needed in 
research to develop and scale up 
CCUS. A CCUS hub model, with 
policy and investment support, 
could also enable a cost-efficient 
route for transportation and storage 
(further detailed in the CCUS 
section).

•  Green fuels prioritisation policy, 

3. 

which could help prioritise 
crop-residue use as biomass 
for cement kilns (and other 
applications) and avoid crop 
residue burning as a result.

•  Demand signals for green cement 
such as carbon pricing, carbon 
emissions trading and green 

Investment in R&D will be 
needed for alternative, lower-
emission technologies like kiln 
electrification, electrolysis-based 
cement production and solar-
energy concentration for cement 
production. These are yet to be 
tested in the cement industry and 
the scale up will be capital intensive.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthIndia can leverage premium priced 
green steel demand in jurisdictions 
like Europe, Japan and Korea to 
kickstart this ambition. Additionally, 
it can start exporting green pig iron 
and green steel from the early 2030s, 
generating revenues of $11 billion 
annually. 

Cumulative emissions would be 
lower by five billion tons by 2050 in 
the Accelerated scenario relative to 
the LoS scenario (ten billion tons by 
2070). While the Capex intensity of 
the steel-making step would decline 
in hydrogen-based steel-making, 
incremental spending on green power 
and hydrogen would likely require an 
additional Capex of about $135 billion, 
which is about 40 percent on top of the 
Capex on the steel value chain across 
technologies. Also, cumulative Forex 
savings of approximately $500 billion 
would accrue through to 2050 from 
reduced spending on coking coal in the 
Accelerated scenario. India would also 
avoid locking into about 200 million 
tons of BF-BOF technology in the 
Accelerated scenario.

Key takeaways
One tenth (11 percent) of India’s 
emissions are from steel (about 
250 MtCO2e in 2020).126 With growth in 
steel demand, this is projected to rise to 
~620 MtCO2e by 2045.

In the LoS scenario, these emissions 
progressively reduce to ~360 Mt per 
annum by 2070 as the intensity 
declines by 80 percent. Higher use 
of scrap (6 to 8X current levels) and 
hydrogen-based steel-making, once it 
becomes competitive from 2045, will 
drive the transition.

In the Accelerated decarbonisation 
scenario, India’s steel emissions would 
peak at ~355 MtCO2e Mt per annum 
declining to ~205 MtCO2e Mt per 
annum by 2050 (about 80 percent of 
current levels). This would require a 
CO2 price on emissions ($50/ton CO2 
by 2030), thereby making hydrogen-
based steel-making competitive versus 
the BF-BOF process. 

126  UNFCCC.

101

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthIn the longer term, decarbonising steel 
will require a transition to low emission 
technologies (Exhibit 52). 

The steel sector today
The steel sector accounts for about 
11 percent of India’s total CO₂ emissions 
and is expected to remain a significant 
carbon emitter. Steel production is 
expected to grow sevenfold to around 
785 MMTPA by 2070, on the back of 
rising steel demand driven by India’s 
economic growth (Exhibit 50).

As a first step towards decarbonising 
the existing assets, about three-five 
percent of the emissions from the 
integrated BF-BOF plants could be 
abated using NPV positive levers mostly 
related to energy efficiency (Exhibit 51). 
Depending on the asset configuration 
of the plant, total abatement could 
be 25 percent with the use of other 
currently value-negative, Opex- and 
Capex-intensive levers such as scrap 
charging and use of biomass.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe LoS scenario
In the LoS scenario, the emissions 
intensity of India’s steel industry could 
be reduced by around 80 percent—
from approximately 2.0 tCO₂/ton 
steel to 0.5 tCO₂/ton steel by 2070, 
through a combination of energy 
efficiency, closure of carbon inefficient 
technologies like coal-based direct 
reduced iron (DRI) and adoption of low 
emission intensity routes (Exhibit 53).

The LoS scenario plays out in two 
phases: the first phase with continued 
addition of virgin steel capacity on 
the BF-BOF route, followed by a 
second one when green hydrogen-
based steelmaking becomes more 
competitive than BF-BOF around 2045 
(Exhibit 54). 

In the first phase, CO2 emissions would 
likely grow from the current 250 Mt to 
around 620 Mt by 2045. CO2 intensity 
would, simultaneously, fall from 
2.0 tCO2/ton CS to around 1.7 tCO2/ton 
CS due to improvements in the energy 
efficiency of BF-BOF and addition of 
electric arc furnace (EAF) scrap.

In the second phase, low emission 
technologies (i.e., EAF scrap and green 
hydrogen-based steel) ramp up to 
90 percent of total steel production 
with simultaneous closures of BF-BOF 
units, reducing emissions to around 
355 Mt CO₂e by 2070 (i.e., 0.5 tCO₂/ton 
of crude steel). 

The LoS scenario would require the 
proposed enablers:

1.  Capacity addition on the EAF-

scrap technology route. This will 
depend on the availability of high-
quality scrap. India has the potential 
to increase its scrap collection rate 
by establishing a scrap collection 
network. Scrap availability could 
increase six- to sevenfold by 2050 
if scrap collection rates from the 
end sectors increased from their 
current levels of 30 to 35 percent to 
around 65 to 70 percent, in line with 
other regions (Exhibit 55). Increased 
scrap availability could grow EAF-
scrap based production threefold to 
65 Mt per annum by 2050.

2.  Green hydrogen-based 

steelmaking. This will likely be on 
a submerged arc furnace-basic 
oxygen furnace (SAF-BOF) route 
to utilise low grade Indian iron ore. 
Green hydrogen-based steelmaking 
would ramp up from 2040 onwards 
to account for about 25 percent of 
steelmaking capacity by 2050 and 
55 percent by 2070. The switch 
from the BF-BOF route may require 
hydrogen prices to fall to $1 per kg 
by 2045 (Exhibit 56).

3.  Decommissioning of existing 
BF-BOF capacities. This is 
assumed to start from 2045 as 
these assets become older than 35 
years (~30 Mt in 2011). As BF-BOF 
continues to lose competitiveness 
and India’s net-zero target 
approaches, decommissioning of 
assets is expected to accelerate 
with assets older than 30 years also 
being decommissioned from about 
2055. All coal-based DRI capacities 
are assumed to decline from 2040 
and close entirely by 2050.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe Accelerated scenario 
In the Accelerated scenario, CO₂ 
intensity will fall from around 2.0 
tCO₂/ton CS to 0.5 tCO₂/ton CS by 
2050, primarily due to the accelerated 
adoption of green hydrogen-based 
steelmaking enabled by a carbon price, 
higher scrap collection rates (Exhibits 
57, 58), no further BF-BOF capacity 
addition after 2030 and closure of older 
BF-BOF and coal-based DRI capacities 
in the 2030s.

Carbon emissions will likely rise from 
their current 250 Mt until 2030 and 
then decline to around 210 Mt per 
year by 2050, despite a fourfold 
growth in steel production by 2050. 
Scrap availability for EAF-scrap in this 
scenario will increase relative to the 
LoS scenario, resulting in an additional 
~45 Mt of EAF scrap production by 
2050 (Exhibit 57).

The introduction of a $50/t CO₂ 
price on every ton of CO₂ emissions 
would likely lead to green hydrogen- 
based steelmaking becoming more 
competitive than the BF-BOF process 
by 2030 (Exhibits 59, 60). Increases in 
coking coal prices could also fast-track 
the transition towards green hydrogen-
based steel making.

green steel will also safeguard indirect 
steel exports (such as machinery and 
automotive parts) which could be at risk 
due to carbon border adjustment tax in 
multiple regions.

In this scenario, existing BF-BOF plants 
older than 35 years are assumed to be 
decommissioned from 2030 onwards, 
and all coal-based DRI plants are 
assumed to be decommissioned by 
2040, replaced by green hydrogen-
based steelmaking and EAF scrap 
routes (Exhibit 61). 

Implications of the 
accelerated decarbonisation 
Accelerating decarbonisation in the 
steel sector could lead to an abatement 
of around 10 GtCO₂e emissions, 
which would be half of the cumulative 
emissions in the LoS scenario between 
2030 and 2070 (Exhibit 62).

The Accelerated scenario leads to 
reduced stranded BF-BOF capacity 
of about 50 Mt in 2050 compared to 
about 260 Mt in the LoS scenario. 
Reduced dependence on BF-BOF 
based steel production (and hence 
reduced dependence on coking coal 
imports) could lead to forex savings of 
around $500 billion by 2050.

India can also leverage premium-priced 
green steel demand in jurisdictions 
like Europe, Japan and Korea to export 
green pig iron and green steel. As green 
hydrogen-based steelmaking ramps 
up from the early 2030s, India can 
export green pig iron and green steel 
and generate revenues of $11 billion 
annually. Domestic availability of

The capital outlay, on an end-to end-
basis, would likely increase, even 
though the steel-making process 
becomes less capital intensive. This 
is because of the extra Capex needed 
for hydrogen and renewable power 
(Exhibits 63, 64). This Capex is front-
loaded in the Accelerated scenario 
with a much higher Capex than in the 
LoS scenario in the 2030-2040 period 
but is subsequently less than the LoS 
scenario in the 2040–2070 period 
(Exhibit 65).

The average cost of steel production in 
the Accelerated scenario is estimated 
to be higher (by 25 percent in 2040) 
than in the LoS scenario, driven by the 
carbon price, higher cost of scrap and 
the need for more electricity to partially 
offset the lower met coal needs. This 
will likely be passed on to consumers, 
with a small inflationary effect on the 
downstream sectors (Exhibit 66).

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth4.  Accelerating low carbon 

technology adoption in steel: 
Steelmaking technologies for 
hydrogen use with Indian raw 
materials, such as green hydrogen-
based SAF-BOF, are still in the 
nascent stages of development 
globally. To start production of 
green hydrogen-based steel by 
2030 in India, steel players would 
need clarity on CO2 pricing in the 
next few years. They would also 
need to make required investments 
in research and development of 
this technology, ensure availability 
of cheap green electricity and 
hydrogen and collaborate with 
global partners on technology 
knowhow and sourcing of 
equipment.

Proposed enablers for 
steel decarbonisation 
As mentioned earlier, a few enablers 
could be considered to accelerate the 
transition towards net zero:

1. 

Introducing CO₂ pricing through 
compliance carbon markets: The 
introduction of CO₂ pricing can be 
calibrated to incentivise low-carbon 
technologies, initially at a small 
scale, to give the domestic industry 
time to adjust. Carbon border 
adjustment mechanisms would also 
need to be considered in parallel for 
equitable treatment of the Indian 
steel industry. 

2.  Mandating green steel 

consumption in the end-use 
sectors: The government could 
mandate the use of green steel in 
setting targets for embodied carbon 
in public and private construction, 
as well as for automotive uses. 

3.  Implementing policies for 

material efficiency and circular 
economy: Policies which incentivise 
scrap collection and recycling, 
which discourage landfills and 
set up dismantling, collection and 
scrap-processing centres would 
need to be put in place.

118

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthSwitching to GHG-efficient farming 
would require extensive education, 
access and incentives given the 
inherent complexities of Indian 
agriculture. Setting up carbon markets 
for farmers could be a crucial enabler 
for encouraging uptake and realising 
benefits. Consumer behaviour will also 
need to change to more sustainable 
food alternatives – education 
campaigns could help promote 
sustainable consumer alternatives. 

The remaining emissions in 2070 
would be hard to abate, with a partial 
offset through carbon removals 
from agroforestry and regenerative 
agricultural practices such as low soil 
tillage. India’s croplands currently 
capture or sequester 267 MtCO₂e 
annually. With accelerated adoption 
of regenerative practices, this could 
increase to over 370 MtCO₂e annually 
by 2070, leading to net negative 
agricultural emissions.

Sustainable agriculture has an 
economic upside for the farmer. In 
the LoS scenario, sustainable farming 
could generate additional earnings 
of roughly INR 3,400/ha/year for 
farmers in the form of ancillary incomes 
from carbon credits, agroforestry 
and improved productivity by 2070. 
This could increase to INR 4,800/ha/
year within the Accelerated scenario, 
presenting an additional revenue 
generation opportunity of $145 billion 
for Indian agriculture by 2070.

Key takeaways
The agricultural sector accounts for 
nearly 20 percent (585 MtCO₂e) of 
India’s emissions.127 It is a challenging 
sector for carbon abatement since it 
would involve engaging with 150 million 
farmers, over 95 percent of whom are 
small-hold farmers (own less than five 
hectares of land).

In the LoS scenario, emissions from 
agriculture are estimated to increase 
to 650 MtCO₂e by 2030 and then 
gradually decline to 530 MtCO₂e by 
2070 driven primarily by improvements 
in fertiliser and energy use (largely 
reducing nitrate fertiliser use and 
intensifying rice cultivation). This is 
despite the expected tripling of the 
agricultural GDP and output by 2070. 

In the Accelerated scenario, faster 
decarbonisation would likely reduce 
emissions to 315 MtCO₂e by 2070, 
leading to a total abatement of 
9 GtCO₂e. Nearly 60 percent of the 
abatement relative to the LoS scenario 
would be driven by sustainable rice 
cultivation, practising dry seeding 
and alternate wetting and drying 
(AWD) methods, further reducing 
nitrate fertilisers and shifting toward 
sustainable consumer alternatives, i.e., 
plant-based protein and millets.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth 
The agriculture sector today
Agriculture is the bedrock of the Indian 
economy; it contributes 14 percent of 
the country’s total GDP and provides 
over 40 percent of its employment.128 
It is vulnerable to climate change, as 
60 percent of agricultural land in India 
is highly dependent on rainfall.129 By 
2100, $9–10 billion in annual losses are 
anticipated due to climate change, with 
major crops expected to see a 10–30 
percent decrease in yield.130

A green transition is important but 
difficult. This section explores the 
features of the agricultural sector, 

outlines two possible ways forward for 
decarbonisation and suggests four big 
ideas to speed up the journey.

A uniquely challenging sector
Agriculture is one of the highest GHG-
emitting sectors in India.131 Annual 
emissions of about 585 MtCO₂e from 
agriculture account for nearly 20 
percent of the country’s overall GHG 
emissions (Exhibit 67).132 Rice and 
livestock alone are responsible for 
70 percent of these emissions.133

Unlike in other sectors, methane 
constitutes a large share of GHG 

emissions from agriculture, with over 
70 percent of India’s total methane 
emissions being driven by enteric 
fermentation in livestock and the 
standing water from rice cultivation. 
India is the second-largest rice 
producer in the world, and more than 
80 percent of its rice fields practise 
continuous flooding.130 Additionally, 
India is second only to China in terms 
of the over-application of nitrogen-
based fertilisers at over 110kg/ha/year, 
more than double the European Union 
average of 52kg/ha/year.134

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthFood demand is expected to increase 
by two or three percent per annum until 
2070, with rice production expected to 
increase from around 170 Mt in 2020 to 
320 Mt by 2050 and 360 Mt by 2070, 
and meat production expected to grow 
from 3 to 7 Mt by 2070, with exports 
continuing to drive production.135 In 
the absence of abatement efforts, 
this ongoing demand would lead to a 
continued increase in emissions.

Unlike in the industrial sectors, abating 
emissions from agriculture would entail 
working with highly decentralised 
and fragmented production and 
regulations. The transformation would 
involve engaging with about 150 million 
farmers, over 95 percent of whom are 
small-hold farmers (owning less than 
five hectares of land). About a quarter 
of these farmers live below the poverty 
line.136

Despite these unique challenges, 
decarbonising the agriculture sector 
is possible. As we have done for other 
sectors, we examined two scenarios 
for how Indian agriculture could 
decarbonise: 1) an LoS scenario that 
aims to decarbonise by 2070 and 2) an 
Accelerated decarbonisation scenario 
that sets the decarbonisation target 20 
years earlier to 2050.137

The LoS scenario
With projected demand growth, 
current farmer and government 
actions in agricultural sustainability, 
total agricultural emissions in India 
are estimated to increase from 585 
MtCO₂e in 2019 to 650 MtCO₂e by 
2030 and then gradually decline to 
around 530 MtCO₂ by 2070. If current 
levels of carbon sequestration from 
croplands continue, net emissions from 
agriculture will likely be 258 MtCO₂e by 
2070 (Exhibit 68).

In this scenario, current efforts by the 
state towards sustainable production 
are assumed to continue at a steady 
pace. Promoting nano-fertilisers and 
bio-decomposers would eliminate 
nitrate overapplication by 2070. The 
practice of burning rice straws would be 
eliminated by 2070, but at a slow and 
uneven pace. The electrification of farm 
tractors and irrigation equipment would 
begin post-2030, with 60–65 percent 
adoption by 2070. This follows trends 
in the transportation sector, particularly 
relating to medium- and heavy-duty 
trucks. Food waste is anticipated to fall 
to 20 percent from the current levels of 
30–40 percent.

Despite these positive developments, 
livestock rearing is expected to remain 
non-intensive, with minimal (10–20 
percent) adoption of efficient feeding 
and manure management practices by 
2070.

Croplands also sequester or remove 
carbon from the atmosphere with the 
application of manure or crop residues, 
as well as plantations and trees on 
croplands. Currently, India’s croplands 
sequester 267 MtCO₂e/year.138 In an 
LoS scenario, this is expected to remain 
at similar levels, reaching 274 MtCO₂e/
year by 2070.139 While incorporation 
of more sustainable practices like 
nano-fertilisers and bio-decomposers 
may increase sequestration, 
continued cultivation could minimise 
the sequestration effect in the LoS 
scenario.

The Accelerated scenario

By our estimates, agricultural emissions 
in the Accelerated scenario could 
be reduced to 322 MtCO₂e by 2050 
(45–50 percent lower than the LoS 
scenario), leading to a cumulative 
abatement of 9 GtCO₂e by 2070. With 
improved sequestration, net emissions 
from agriculture could be net negative 
by 2050, reaching almost −50 MtCO₂e 
(Exhibit 68).

135   Outlook based on FAO; production estimated to follow population and GDP growth.
136   National statistical offices survey.
137   The emissions trajectory is based on continued GDP and population growth. Emission intensity is estimated to reduce post-2030 with expanding policies to reduce 

nitrate fertilisers and drive yield improvements and electrification.

138   UNFCCC.
139   Current sequestration figures are retrieved from India’s submission to UNFCCC and are mainly driven by Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). This is expected to decrease 

with inaction. In the LoS scenario, regenerative farming practices continue at current rates and thereby maintain current SOC levels.

Arising from a combination of policies 
and consumer preferences, this 
scenario could also see a demand 
shift toward GHG-efficient diets. 
Less water-intensive crops like 
millets could replace 30–40 percent 
of rice consumption by 2050,140 
driven by a combination of consumer 
health preferences and government 
actions to promote alternatives. Meat 
consumption could decline by 30 
percent due to increasing shifts toward 
alternative proteins. The food-waste 
ratio could also decline to five or ten 
percent from its current levels with 
improved supply-chain management.

Modernisation of rice production and 
electrification alone could account 
for nearly 40 percent of the emission 
abatement in the Accelerated scenario 
(Exhibit 69). Total electrification of 
tractors and irrigation pumps could 
abate all emissions from agricultural 
energy use. The cost savings from fuel 
and the declining expenditure on EVs 
could offset the costs.

Introducing slow-release fertiliser 
forms and nitrification inhibitors 
would reduce fertiliser-induced field 
emissions and fertiliser consumption, 
subsequently reducing emissions from 
production and transportation.

Still water in rice fields leads to methane 
release and additional fertiliser use. A 
shift to AWD fields, dry seeding and 
straw management could reduce these 
emissions and simultaneously lower 
costs. Improving feed digestibility, 
boosting additives to ruminant diets 
and managing manure would also 

reduce methane emissions from 
livestock.

The Accelerated scenario could 
see half of all rice cultivation taking 
place with efficient straw and water 
management practices, i.e., dry direct 
seeding and AWD. Straw burning could 
be completely eradicated by 2050, with 
residues used as biomass or organic 
fertiliser.

Nearly half of all livestock rearing could 
be improved with the implementation 
of efficient feeding practices, i.e., feed-
mix optimisation and grain processing. 
Efforts toward efficient fertiliser use 
could be accelerated with nitrate over-
application being eliminated by 2030. 
The Accelerated scenario could also 
see farmers being incentivised to use 
electric tractors and farm equipment, 
leading to complete farm equipment 
electrification between 2030 and 
2050.

Given the structural challenges and 
technological limitations it faces, 
agriculture is estimated to emit 320 
MtCO₂e in 2070, despite accelerated 
decarbonisation. Three-quarters 
of these emissions would be in the 
form of methane from livestock,141 
whose abatement is incumbent on 
next-horizon technologies, i.e., direct 

methane capture, inhibition of enteric 
fermentation through vaccines or 
special additives and more viable forms 
of alternative proteins.

With current technologies, attaining 
net-zero emissions would require 
natural carbon offsets from croplands. 
With accelerated adoption of 
regenerative practices and plantations, 

India’s croplands could sequester 
nearly 370 MtCO₂e/year by 2050, 
offsetting residual emissions.142 
Practicing low-tillage farming and 
planting trees on croplands and 
pasturelands alone can help sequester 
an additional 100 MtCO₂e annually by 
2050 (Exhibit 70).

Proposed investments and 
implications
In an LoS scenario, implementing 
green interventions in agriculture may 
require total Capex spending of nearly 
$240 billion by 2070. Accelerating the 
transition by 2050 would likely require 
an additional spend of $240 billion over 
LoS (Exhibit 71).143 

Significantly, nearly half the proposed 
green interventions could be carried out 
at net-negative lifecycle costs (Exhibit 
72). Sustainable agriculture could also 
open up avenues for premium pricing, 
creating further economic gains. 

143   Includes only the cost of decarbonisation levers as modelled in the scenarios, based on McKinsey’s global agriculture lever library; please refer to the technical

Acceleration has considerable 
benefits
Accelerated decarbonisation could 
abate an additional 9 GtCO₂e by 2070 
(a quarter of global CO₂ emissions in 
2019), compared to the LoS scenario, 
and lead to additional earnings worth 
$145 billion by 2070 (Exhibit 73).

In the LoS scenario, sustainable 
farming could generate additional 
earnings of roughly INR 3,400/ha/
year in the form of cost savings from 
improved productivity and ancillary 
incomes from carbon credits and 
agroforestry. This could increase to 
INR 4,800/ha/year with acceleration—
roughly eight to ten percent of the 
current average income of a farming 
household.144 Excluding expenses 
incurred on adopting sustainable 
farming practices, gross revenues in 
an accelerated scenario could be over 
INR 8,000/ha/year. 

Nearly all additional operating 
expenses involved in practicing 
sustainable farming could be offset by 
cost savings between 2020–2070.

Agroforestry and recycling crop 
residues rather than burning them 
could also create incremental earnings 
of $150 billion (2020–2070) in the 
form of carbon credits and the sale 
of by-products and residues.145 
Implementing a carbon-credit system 
in India would require overcoming the 
challenges of smallholder farming, 
i.e., the lack of support in planning 
and the need for credible accounting. 
Digitisation and creating farmer 
collectives that integrate multiple 
farmers and their sites could help 
address some of these challenges. 

In addition to socioeconomic benefits, 
sustainable agriculture has several 
environmental benefits. It can help 
improve soil nutrients and sustainability, 
reduce water consumption and improve 
air quality (e.g., by mitigating pollution 
from straw burning). An improved yield 

from sustainable farming can also 
free up an additional five to six million 
hectares of land compared to the LoS 
scenario, which can help address land 
availability challenges.146 

Proposed enablers for 
agriculture decarbonisation
Targeted regulatory and policy 
interventions could be considered for 
abatement in the agriculture sector. 
Four moves could contribute to an 
accelerated transition by 2050: 

1. 

Incentivising GHG-efficient 
practices and technologies. A 
green transition in agriculture is 
limited not only by capital but also 
by the challenge of fragmentation. 
India’s farmers are widely dispersed 
and practise non-intensive 
farming, and there is often a lack of 
awareness about the practices and 
benefits of sustainable farming. A 
switch in farming techniques would, 
therefore, require support in the 
form of education, access to new 
methods and incentives.

Education can be crucial in creating 
awareness of the downsides of 
conventional practices, for example, 
the deterioration of soil health 
caused by excessive fertiliser use. 
It can also highlight the benefits of 
sustainable farming. For instance, 
reducing the continuous flooding 
of rice fields could result in the 
use of 40 percent less water and 
reduce cultivation costs by at least 
20 percent.147 Since 85 percent of 
rural women in India are engaged 
in agriculture, their education is 
crucial.148 Decarbonisation could 
improve the livelihoods and incomes 
of these women through increased 
savings from sustainable farming 
practices.

Access to equipment and local 
dispensaries is a necessity for 
farmers trying to practice dry 
seeding and better livestock 
rearing. A lack of veterinary 
hospitals, for instance, has a huge 
impact on livestock health and 
productivity. Equipment for dry 
seeding and residue collection can 
also be made available for custom 
hiring across the country.

Incentives can play an important 
role in encouraging the initial 
uptake of GHG-efficient fertilisers 
such as nano-fertilisers and bio-
enzymes, as well as quality feed 
for livestock. Funding schemes 
for EVs can also be extended to 
farm tractors. These practices 
can be implemented effectively by 
prioritising specific high-impact 
crop ecosystems for sustainable 
agriculture, such as rice in Andhra 
Pradesh and Telangana and wheat 
in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.

2.  Implementing a co-beneficial 

ecosystem for farmers. 
Integrating farmers into carbon 
markets can speed up the adoption 
of sustainable practices while 
improving farmer resilience and 
income. This would also address 
challenges and drive the adoption 
of solutions for small farmers. 
Furthermore, carbon sequestration 
from sustainable farming, such as 
planting trees and cover crops, can 
be calculated, allowing the creation 
and sale of carbon credits. For 
example, planting trees on 80–90 
percent of croplands can generate 
additional credits worth $60 billion 
by 2070, or $330/ha.

Case study: Australian farmers earn credits for reducing carbon emissions.

Action

Objective

Details

Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) 2011—Landowners could earn carbon credits by changing land-use or 
management practices to store carbon or reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) 2015—building on CFI, expanded coverage to encourage emissions 
reductions across the economy

Emissions reduction targets:
 5% below 2000 levels by 2020  
 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030
 80% below 2000 levels by 2050

Economy-wide budget of $4.55 billion, initially $2.55 billion; this budget was increased in 2019 to 
ramp up ambition
Farmers enter into a contract where they earn credits for carbon-reduction activities on farm; these credits 
can then be sold to the Australian government or to businesses wishing to offset their emissions
Eligible activities include:

 Increasing fertiliser efficiency 
 Enhancing soil carbon through 

practices like cover cropping and 
no-till agriculture

 Storing carbon in biomass
 Reducing livestock emissions
 Collecting methane off effluent dams use to generate biogas

Impact

Projects in Queensland and New South Wales have received more than $800 million in carbon-farming credits

So far, the ERF has bought contracts to abate 180 Mt of carbon for up to 10 or 20 years
ERF has delivered income $239 million annual revenue for landholders

Implementing a carbon-market 
ecosystem is complex and would 
involve overcoming several challenges, 
for instance, awareness of carbon 
programmes and operations. Farmers 
will require end-to-end support from 
planning practices and implementation 
to collecting the correct information 
and submitting verification paperwork. 
These challenges are further 
exacerbated in a primarily smallholder 
Indian agriculture sector.

Integrating several farmers owning 
a few hectares of land through 
the support of Farmer Producer 
Organisations can address some 
of these challenges. Such projects 
could also consider leveraging digital 
platforms and various data sources 
to accelerate and reduce the cost 
of validation or verification. The 
government may also need to create 
a comprehensive framework for 
intermediaries and other stakeholders.

3.  Creating links with other sectors. 

The creation of links to other 
sectors that can upcycle agricultural 
and crop waste is another initiative 
that could accelerate this transition. 
Such collaborations would reduce 
straw burning and crop-residue 
mismanagement. The waste, 
once upcycled, could be used for 
packaging material or as carbon-
neutral biomass in industry. 
The use of bio-decomposers 
breaks down residue into organic 
fertiliser, leading to reduced 
fertiliser manufacture and use. In 
addition, strong supply networks 
could ensure easy collection, 
transportation and usage of 
residues. 

4.  Instigating demand shifts. To 

achieve maximum abatement, there 
is also a need for demand-side 
shifts. A shift in demand from meat 
and rice requires investments in 
sustainable consumer alternatives 

such as plant-based or lab-grown 
protein and the promotion of coarse 
cereals. The promotion of water-
efficient cereals like millets can 
also make India a global hub for 
sustainable staples.

******

Operationalising these moves 
would require support at different 
governmental levels. Multiple, targeted 
missions that address the challenges 
in rice, dairy, meat and fertilisers would 
be needed to design solutions, lay 
out transition roadmaps, provide the 
necessary resources and integrate all of 
these into the wider agri-development 
programmes. Part of the solution would 
lie in involving the private sector and 
civil society in the implementation.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth3.  Cross-cutting enablers

3.1   Green hydrogen

132

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe investment needed (till 2050) 
is estimated to be in the region of 
$430 billion across green hydrogen 
production (i.e., electrolysers and 
renewable energy – accounting 
for $316 billion), midstream (i.e., 
storage and pipeline infrastructure 
– accounting for $114 billion) in the 
Accelerated scenario. The comparable 
investment by 2050 in the LoS scenario 
is $242 billion.

Beyond the already stated measures, 
policy interventions could be 
considered for i) creating blending 
mandates across the ammonia 
and refinery sectors; ii) introducing 
carbon pricing through compliance 
carbon markets; iii) introducing PLIs 
or subsidies to strengthen local 
production and build technological 
capabilities locally; iv) initiating bilateral 
MoUs with importing countries like 
Japan, the UK, South Korea and the 
EU for hydrogen and hydrogen-based 
products.

Key takeaways

Green hydrogen149 will likely become 
increasingly cost competitive with 
declining electrolyser Capex and 
reducing renewable energy costs, 
getting to $2/kg in our LoS scenario 
and $1.8/kg in the Accelerated scenario 
by 2030. Additionally, government 
support (capital subsidies, power 
banking, PLI schemes, transmission 
charge waivers) and regulations 
(specifically, carbon price) can 
accelerate their competitiveness 
against the relevant alternatives which 
include grey hydrogen, coking coal and 
diesel.

In the LoS scenario, green hydrogen 
becomes progressively competitive 
– 2030 in chemicals and refinery; 
2035 in long-haul trucking; 2040 
in power storage applications; and 
2045 in steel. In this scenario, India 
could stop building blast furnace-
based steel capacity by 2045 (instead 
building green hydrogen-based steel 
capacities), thus cumulatively abating 
1.9 Gt of emissions by 2050 and 12.5 Gt 
by 2070.

In our Accelerated scenario, with 
a carbon price of $50 per tonne, green 
hydrogen becomes competitive for all 
major uses in the 2030s. This unlocks 
three times the LoS use of green 
hydrogen in the hard-to-abate sectors 
that are also new users of hydrogen (i.e., 
steel, trucking and power) by 2040, 
and leads to accelerated investment 
in low carbon assets. For example, 
211 Mt of new steel capacity could 
shift to the green hydrogen steel route 
in this scenario between 2030 and 
2045 (instead of the high carbon blast 
furnace steel route as in LoS). This 
cumulatively abates 5.7 GtCO₂e by 
2050 and 18.8 GtCO₂ by 2070.

The green hydrogen transition could 
be kickstarted early by blending 
mandates for current grey hydrogen 
uses. About 5–6 Mt of grey hydrogen 
is currently used in refining, methanol 
and ammonia as feedstock.150 This 
can be decarbonised by using green 
hydrogen through appropriate blending 
mandates, thus creating demand for 
green hydrogen in India in this decade. 
This could accelerate the cost reduction 
of green hydrogen, opening up uses 
in hard-to-abate sectors like steel, 
trucking, marine mobility and power 
storage, as it becomes cheaper than 
the current fuel (i.e., diesel for trucks, 
coal in blast furnaces). Moving early on 
green hydrogen helps a growing India 
avoid locking into carbon-intensive 
assets for the next half century (e.g., 
for steel production) and leads to lower 
imports (e.g., ammonia, coking coal, 
crude oil).

Early unlock of low carbon assets 
through green hydrogen in the 
Accelerated scenario would have 
many benefits. These include 
cumulative Forex savings of $420 billion 
in oil and gas and $280 billion in coking 
coal by 2050. In addition, by 2040, 
green hydrogen can be a new industry 
with revenues of $30–35 billion per 
annum. While the domestic opportunity 
matures over time, India could be one of 
the most competitive global producers

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthContext
Green hydrogen, made from renewable 
energy, is essential for India’s 
decarbonisation — as a replacement 
for grey hydrogen for fertilisers and 
refineries and for newer uses like green 
steel and trucking. By 2070, green 
hydrogen could account for 15–20 
percent of India’s primary energy mix, 

helping to abate 12–18 GtCO₂e of 
cumulative emissions. Local production 
of green hydrogen also offers India a 
path to energy independence, reducing 
the need for crude oil, gas, ammonia 
and urea imports.

Globally, there is momentum toward 
a hydrogen economy as more than 
30 governments have announced 

hydrogen strategies (Exhibit 75). India 
also announced its green hydrogen 
policy in February 2022 which promises 
lower cost power with inter-state 
transmission charges waived, banking 
for in the grid and a green hydrogen 
mission.151

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthGreen hydrogen demand will be 
generated by substituting grey 
hydrogen for existing uses such as 
crude-oil refining, methanol production, 
fertiliser and city-gas blending. New 
uses in hard-to-abate sectors such as 
long-haul trucking, steel production 
and power storage replacing current 
fuels can unlock much bigger demand. 
Green hydrogen replaces different 
fuels or feedstocks in each case – grey 
hydrogen, coking coal or diesel– and 
hence needs to become competitive 
against each one. Currently, all the 
hydrogen produced in India (5–6 Mt) 
is grey, for fertilisers, refining and 
chemicals.152 In addition, India imports 
about 2 Mt of grey hydrogen embedded 
in fertilisers.153

This section addresses four important 
themes for the development of green 
hydrogen – what it will take for green 
hydrogen to become competitive 
versus relevant alternatives in both the 
LoS and the Accelerated scenarios; 
how the demand will develop; what the 
benefits and costs of acceleration are; 
and what it will take to drive adoption at 
scale.

The LoS scenario assumes that the 
technology costs for electrolysers 
and green power costs decline as 
expected and current policies continue. 
The Accelerated scenario assumes 
a somewhat faster decline in green 
hydrogen production costs ($1.8/kg by 
2030 versus $2/kg in LoS) with a $50 
carbon price and blending mandates. 

Competitiveness of green 
hydrogen
Currently on-site steam methane 
reformer (SMR)-based grey hydrogen 
is used in most downstream processes 
such as refineries and ammonia 
production. The current production cost 
of $1.90/kg will increase with natural 
gas prices. In contrast, green hydrogen 
production costs are expected to 
decline by 55 percent over the next 
decade, becoming cost competitive 
against grey hydrogen by around 2030 
(Exhibit 76).

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthHence, existing use-cases – refinery, 
ammonia, methanol, natural gas 
blending – for green hydrogen will 
be in-the-money by around 2030 in 
both scenarios. With a carbon price of 
$50 per tonne, new use-cases in long 
haul trucking and steel making are 
also expected to be in-the-money by 
2030. Green hydrogen usage in power 
storage is expected to be the last to 
become cost competitive (Exhibit 77).

In the LoS scenario, when green 
hydrogen gets to $2/kg enabled 
by current policies, it is expected to 
become progressively competitive 
against alternatives – 2030 for 
chemicals and refinery; 2035 for long-
haul trucking; 2040 for power storage 
applications; and 2045 for steel. In our 
Accelerated scenario, with a carbon 
price of $50 per tonne, green hydrogen 
is expected to become competitive 
for the majority of uses by 2030154

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthIn the Accelerated scenario, hydrogen 
demand in the 2030s and 2040s is 
expected to be much higher for the 
hard-to-abate sectors of steel, trucking 
and power (8X of demand in the same 
sectors in 2040 and 3X in 2050) 
(Exhibit 80). In each of these hard-to 
abate sectors, different dynamics could 
be at play:

 — Steel could be one of the largest 

consumers of green hydrogen from 
2030 onwards in the Accelerated 
scenario. This is because even a 

relatively small carbon price makes 
hydrogen-based steel-making 
much more competitive relative to 
the blast furnace-coking coal route.

 — Automotive: Hydrogen fuel cell 
based long-haul trucking155 is 
expected to become progressively 
more cost competitive in lifecycle 
value terms versus the internal 
combustion engine as well as 
battery EVs. This could be another 
big consumer of hydrogen post-
2030.

 — Power: Hydrogen is a small part 
of the storage solution with other 
options being much more economic. 
Power storage could be the last 
to adopt green hydrogen since 
the current alternatives will likely 
be 40–50 percent lower cost. 
Nevertheless, as India moves to in 
firm renewable sources, hydrogen 
would play a key role in grid 
balancing and energy storage.

Accelerated scenario, this would 
be 14 Mt, with the balance being 
hydrogen-based green steel. Steel 
assets last for 40 to 50 years.156 
Hence, the LoS scenario implies 
locking into high carbon assets for 
much longer. This is an investment 
of about $265 billion in steel-
making, which could also be at the 
risk of getting stranded in case of 
climate shock or early closure, even 
with India’s 2070 net-zero NDC 
(Exhibit 81).

adoption of green hydrogen
 — Building India right, first time. 
Accelerating hydrogen adoption 
in steel-making could help India 
build the right assets, reduce the 
risk of being left stranded and 
create additional carbon space. 
Growing steel demand means 
rapid and continued capacity 
addition in the 2030s and 2040s.

Exporting green hydrogen-based 
products, also to incubate the 
hydrogen economy in India. India can 
also be one of the most competitive 
producers of green hydrogen (and its 
derivatives). This creates an opportunity 
for India to export $5–6 billion worth 
of green hydrogen derivatives exports 
(e.g., green hydrogen-based DRI and 
ammonia) by 2030 to energy-short 
markets that have set high targets for 
decarbonisation (e.g., South Korea, 
Japan, the EU) (Exhibit 84). More 
importantly, this provides India with the 
opportunity to start participating in the 
hydrogen economy quicker. 

Proposed investment 
required for green hydrogen 
The Accelerated scenario would likely 
require $430 billion in investment for 
green hydrogen by 2050, roughly twice 
what will be needed in the LoS scenario. 
This would be split across solar-
power and electrolyser capacity and 
midstream for setting up new pipelines 
and retrofitting existing natural-gas 
pipelines for hydrogen distribution 
(Exhibit 85).

in the EU could also be considered 
(similar to the tenders that India’s Solar 
Mission launched to spur on renewable

Proposed enablers to 
accelerate hydrogen adoption 
The following measures could be 
considered for accelerating the 
hydrogen economy in India: 

1. Creating blending mandates 
across ammonia, refinery and 
fertiliser, which would likely kickstart 
the adoption of green hydrogen 
(and derivatives) as a replacement 
for grey hydrogen. Similar steps are 
being taken globally. For example, in

4. Initiating bilateral MoUs with 
importing countries such as Japan, 
the UK and South Korea for green 
hydrogen-based products. Australia, 
for example, has agreements with 
South Korea and Japan to establish an 
international hydrogen supply chain.160 
India could attempt something similar 
to incubate a green hydrogen and 
hydrogen-based product industry even 
as local demand develops. 

2. Introducing carbon pricing through 
compliance carbon markets in a 
calibrated but accelerated manner, 
providing steel makers with the 
policy-certainty to be able to invest. 
This will need to be accompanied with 
appropriate carbon border adjustment 
mechanisms to ensure the global 
competitiveness of India’s steel and 
manufacturing industry. A $50 per ton 
carbon price can accelerate hydrogen-
based steel-making by 15 years.

3. Building a local equipment 
industry by instituting actions such as 
PLIs159 to induce local manufacturing for 
electrolysers and the balance of plants. 
For example, a subsidy of $60–80/
KW in electrolyser manufacturing can 
accelerate green versus grey hydrogen 
competitiveness by five years. Investing 
in R&D for developing indigenous, 
hydrogen-based electrolysers, fuel 
cells and hydrogen DRI would provide 
the necessary thrust for domestic 
production. Additionally, attracting 
global technology players to India will 
be important.

likely need demand signals and 
policy support from the government 
in the form of landfill levies, EPR 
frameworks included with blending 
mandates, carbon pricing on emission 
heavy products. Further investment in 
technology like chemical recycling and 
infrastructure like mobile waste sorting 
vehicles would be required. 

Key takeaways
India currently generates 750–800 
Mt of waste annually. Of this, 500 
Mt is crop-residue waste, of which 
72 percent is recycled. Of all other 
types of solid waste—such as 
municipal, C&D and plastic—only 13 
percent is recycled.161

Our LoS scenario assumes increasing 
recycling rates to 39 percent by 2050 
for non-agricultural waste streams, 
and 87 percent for crop residue. This 
level of material circularity is supported 
by current policies and leads to a 
cumulative reduction of 22 GtCO₂e by 
2070. 

The Accelerated scenario could see 
increased recycling levels to 58 percent 
across non-agricultural waste streams 
and 100 percent across agricultural 
waste streams by 2050 leading to 
an additional cumulative reduction of 
12 GtCO₂e by 2070. This would likely 
require accelerated implementation of 
existing policies, e.g., EPR for plastic 
waste, e-waste and tyre waste, and 
new policies and blending mandates, 
such as 50 percent recycled plastics in 
packaging (as opposed to a 30 percent 
target for select plastics today) and 
20 percent recycled concrete as a 
clinker substitute (does not exist today). 

Material circularity could generate 
benefits beyond abatement. Actions 
in the LoS scenario could reduce 
emissions by 1.2 GtCO₂e per annum 
by 2070, whereas the Accelerated 
scenario could abate 1.45–1.5 GtCO₂e 
of emissions per annum by 2070. 
Overall, material circularity could 
generate net savings by improving 
closed-loop production. For instance, 
recycling hubs for new waste streams 
such as EV batteries could drive 
domestic production and create 
cumulative precious-metals import 
savings of $720–730 billion by 2070, 
with a 50 percent reduction in virgin 
material imports. 

Significant capital and operational 
expenditure will likely be needed for 
collection, sorting and processing of 
waste to accelerate material circularity. 
Capex investment of $660 billion 
would likely be required by 2070 in 
the Accelerated scenario ($220 billion 
more than in the LoS scenario), with 
the majority going towards recovery 
and recycling infrastructure for 
construction (one percent recycled) and 
plastic waste (25 percent recycled).

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthContext 
Our current economy is based on a 
linear, ‘take-make-waste’ system of 
production. This leads to significant 
waste generation and a loss in value of 
materials and components. In a circular 
economy, closed (or partially closed) 
loop systems of production minimise 
waste. By reusing raw materials and 
implementing looped production 

systems, waste consumption can be 
driven without being limited by finite 
resources, and value from materials can 
be maximised (Exhibit 88).

A linear-economy system is not 
sustainable and leads to resource 
depletion, waste and increasing 
emissions. Material circularity, by 
contrast, can help regenerate nature, 
while minimising resource depletion 

and waste generation. It is also a 
cost-efficient way to reduce carbon 
emissions: production from recycled 
raw materials can reduce emissions 
by between 50 and 98 percent versus 
virgin raw materials (Exhibit 89).

committed to 100 percent reusable 
packaging by 2030), textiles (e.g., 
H&M) and tyres (e.g., Continental 
Tyres) have announced ambitious 
plans for using recycled content in 
their products.163 However, Indian 
players have not made similar 
commitments, given low consumer 
awareness and limited economic 
incentives.  

 — Inadequate enforcement 

of regulations such as EPR 
guidelines. While waste-
management rules across multiple 
waste streams have been in 
effect since 2016, implementation 
remains a challenge. For example, 
recycling of e-waste stands at 
14 percent, against EPR guidelines 
of 40 percent. 164

India currently generates 750–800 
Mt of solid waste annually across 
various waste streams, with recycling 
rates mostly varying between one and 
30 percent.162 Some waste streams, 
such as construction, textile and tyre 
waste are recycled at rates as low as 
one to seven percent (Exhibit 90).

Low recycling rates are driven by 
three main factors: 
 — Weak demand signals. Globally, 
many leading consumer players in 
sectors like fast-moving consumer 
goods (e.g., Unilever has committed 
to halve the amount of virgin plastic 
they use in packaging and P&G has

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthUse of recycled materials as feedstock 
can lead to emission reductions in the 
steel, cement, agriculture, chemicals 
and aluminium industries, as well 
as lower emissions from landfills 
(Exhibit 91). Exhibit 92 shows examples 
of cross-sector utilisation of recycled 
materials across waste streams. 

India is dependent on the 
unorganised sector for waste 
collection, which means only high-
value waste is collected. As a result, 
recycling rates are higher in waste 
streams with strong economic 
incentives such as steel (vehicle 
recycling rates in India are greater 
than 70 percent) and PET bottles 
(80 percent recycling, including 
conversion to rPET and polyester), 
and much lower for construction 
and e-waste.165

 — Insufficient investment in 

infrastructure for collecting, 
sorting and processing waste 
streams. For example, there are only 
four waste-management facilities 
in Delhi, compared to Tokyo with 19 
facilities for a similar population.166 
The lack of data collected at 
waste-stream level regarding the 
collection, sorting and recycling of 
post-consumer waste also poses 
challenges.

The LoS scenario 
While policies exist (Exhibit 90), due 
to a lack of infrastructure, the country 
is not able to reach target recycling 
rates. We estimate that with continuous 
improvement in the necessary 
infrastructure for collection, sorting 
and recycling of all waste streams, 
recycling rates can be increased to 38 
percent (currently at 13 percent) for 
non-agricultural waste streams, and 
87 percent (currently at 72 percent) 
for crop residue by 2050. This level of 
material circularity could help abate 
emissions of 440 MtCO₂e per annum 
by 2050 and 1.16 GtCO₂e per annum by 
2070 across all sectors. 

These gains will likely require significant 
investment. Moreover, distributed 
waste generation, high recovery costs 
for remote locations and long lead times 
to drive consumer-habit changes could 
lead to delayed achievement of EPR 
targets for waste streams like e-waste, 
plastic and tyres, even though recycling 
technologies for these exist.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe Accelerated scenario
There is an opportunity to accelerate 
material circularity further and 
drive improvements in recovery and 
recycling. Dedicated policy, technology 
and infrastructure efforts could 
increase recycling rates across waste 
streams (Exhibit 93). 

This acceleration could help abate 
800 MtCO₂e per annum of emissions 
by 2050, and 1.47 GtCO₂e per annum 
by 2070, leading to a 50 percent higher 
abatement versus the LoS scenario 
(Exhibit 91).

This acceleration would likely require 
unlocks in waste-management 
policy, demand creation for recycled 
materials and improvements in 
recycling technology (Exhibit 94). 
It would also require an exponential 
increase in consumer awareness 
through collaborative efforts by the 
government, civil society and waste 
management organisations, to ensure 
waste segregation at source and the 
sustainable consumption of recyclable 
materials.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthMaterial circularity 
investment and implications
The acceleration of material circularity 
will likely require significant capital 
and operational expenditure (Capex 
and Opex) for collection, sorting and 
processing of waste (Exhibit 95). An 
estimated Capex investment of $660 
billion would likely be required by 2070 
in the Accelerated scenario ($220 
billion more than in the LoS scenario), 
with the majority going towards 
recovery and recycling infrastructure 
for construction (one percent recycled) 
and plastic waste (25 percent 
recycled).167 

Opex costs for collection, sorting and 
processing of waste are projected to 
be an average $74 billion annually till 
2070; cumulatively $3.7 trillion in the 
Accelerated scenario ($820 billion 
more than LoS). However, there is 
already a demand for high-quality 
recycled raw material across sectors 
like steel, aluminium and plastics, which 
could help absorb the Opex and Capex 
costs of recycling. 

Moreover, with the right enablers (such 
as blending mandates, percentage 
recycled material and carbon pricing), 
the creation of demand signals for 
recycled raw material could enable 
a green premium. This is already 
happening in markets such as the EU, 
where recycled raw materials sell at 
a 15–30 percent premium over virgin 
materials.168 Additionally, imported 
materials, particularly precious rare-
earth materials, scrap steel and 
aluminium can be reduced.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThere is the potential to save 
$720–730 billion in imports by 
2070 by creating recycling hubs 
for new waste streams such as 
EV batteries. By investing early in 
technology, regulations (for both waste 
management and demand signals) and 
infrastructure for cell-level recycling of 
end-of-life batteries, up to 90 percent 
of precious raw materials could be 
recovered. This could help meet the 
growing demand for precious-metal 
batteries—lithium iron phosphate 
(LFP) and nickel manganese cobalt 
(NMC) due to growth in EVs, consumer 

electronics and long-duration storage 
(Exhibit 96). Once EV battery recycling 
occurs at the right quality, India could 
also recycle the world’s end-of-life EV 
batteries. 

Proposed enablers for 
accelerating material 
circularity
Driving material circularity across all 
waste streams will likely require shifts 
in policy and regulation, significant 
investment in infrastructure and 
support for technological innovation. 

Demand signals to encourage 
recycling of waste could include:
 — Landfill levies to reduce waste 
generation and promote reuse 
of material and circularity in 
production.

 — EPR frameworks that include 
blending mandates to create 
demand signals for recycled raw-
material use, similar to current 
policies for plastics. Mandates and 
recommended targets, similar to the 
EU’s Circularity Action Plan, could 
be considered.169

 — Signals for recycled and low-carbon 

169   EU circular economy action plan.

3. End-of-life recycling at cell level can help recover lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt from NMC and LFP batteries.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthInvestment in technology for 
improved recycling and waste 
management:

 — Technological innovations and 
scale-ups, such as chemical 
recycling, could help to manage 
waste across multiple streams, such 
as plastics, textiles, windmill blades 
and solar panels. 

 — Digitisation of waste-collection 
information, especially for post-
consumer waste, could significantly 
improve collection and sorting rates 
across streams in a cost-effective 
and efficient manner.

Investment in setting up 
infrastructure for collection, sorting 
and processing of waste could be 
considered:

 — Innovations such as mobile 

waste-sorting vehicles to improve 
construction waste collection rates, 
and for sorting and reuse on-site; 
static sorting centres to manage 
remaining construction waste, 
reducing transportation costs.

 — Dedicated zones for recovery 
and recycling across multiple 
waste streams. This could reduce 
recycling facilities’ Capex and Opex 
investments by up to ten percent 
(versus distributed facilities) and 
facilitate transportation from one 
stream to another—plastics from 
e-waste, for example, could be 
transported to a plastic-recycling 
facility in the same zone. 

With these enablers in place, India can 
move away from the current waste-
generating production system toward 
a closed-loop, circular economy that 
maximises value in a sustainable 
manner.

products. For example, carbon 
pricing on emission-heavy, virgin, 
raw-material-based products can 
help create demand signals for 
recycled raw materials. 

Policies and regulations for waste 
management could include:
 — Stringent enforcement and 

accelerated implementation of 
existing EPR regulations and waste-
management rules (e.g., for plastic 
waste, tyre waste and e-waste) 
could achieve specified recycling 
targets much faster than in LoS. 

 — New policies could be considered 
for existing mismanaged waste 
streams (such as textiles and 
construction waste) and upcoming 
ones (EV batteries, solar panels 
and windmill blades). India can 
take inspiration from material-
recovery and circular-economy 
strategies successfully adopted by 
the EU, Australia, China and the US 
(Exhibit 97).170

 — Policies for registration and 

operation of recycling facilities 
could be considered to ensure 
quality and safety standards.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth3.3   Natural climate solutions

162

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthKey takeaways
Natural climate solutions can help 
avoid, reduce and sequester GHG 
emissions through the conservation, 
restoration and improved management 
of natural or modified ecosystems. 
Currently, India’s forests, wetlands 
and croplands sequester an estimated 
345 MtCO₂e annually.171

In the LoS scenario, this 
sequestration could increase to 
roughly 411 MtCO₂e by 2050. Over 
95 percent of the carbon removal and 
emission avoidance would come from 
land-based solutions, not accounting 
for less-explored coastal or blue-
carbon solutions. 

In the Accelerated scenario, India’s 
NCS potential could increase to 
644 MtCO₂e by 2050, leading to 
additional cumulative sequestration 
of 3 GtCO₂e between 2020–2050, 
and over 7 GtCO₂e by 2070. Nearly 
85 percent of sequestration in the 
Accelerated scenario would come 
from forests, agroforestry and 
regenerative agriculture. This would 
require restoring an additional 8 million 
hectares of forests (over ten percent 
of current forest cover) and practising 
regenerative agriculture, such as low-
till farming, in at least half of India’s 
croplands.

New solutions would be needed to 
sequester the remaining emissions 
(~400 MtCO₂e per year in 2050 in the 
Accelerated scenario) and achieve 
net zero. India will likely have to 
explore emerging and nascent blue-
carbon solutions, such as seaweed 
farming and ocean fauna. This would 
require investment in research and 
comprehensive marine protection 
policies.

Accelerating NCS offers several 
upsides. Cumulative carbon credits 
from sequestration could amount to 
more than $480 billion by 2070. NCS 
would also have numerous social and 
environmental co-benefits, such as 
biodiversity protection; air, water and 
soil sustainability; and mitigation and 
adaptation to climate hazards.

Accelerating adoption in a fast-
growing economy will be challenging. 
It could require a total investment of 
around $160 billion by 2070—$110 
billion more than in the LoS scenario. 
Incentivising investments in NCS would 
require structural interventions, such 
as setting up domestic carbon markets 
and creating natural capital solutions 
to convert natural resources into 
investible assets. Regional road maps 
could also drive implementation to 
deliver high-impact NCS projects.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthContext
NCS have a major role to play in 
avoiding, removing and sequestering 
GHG emissions, while offering benefits 
for society and the environment.

The different facets of the Indian 
economy are expected to continue 
emitting around 1.4 GtCO₂e annually till 
2050, even in an Accelerated scenario. 
Abating this would require carbon 
removal through technologies like 
CCUS, DAC and NCS.

NCS refers to the conservation and 
restoration of natural ecosystems to 
increase their carbon-storage potential 
and avoid GHG emissions. This includes 
the protection of a range of natural 
resources such as forests, mangroves 
and peatlands. Compared to other 
sequestration methods, NCS are cost-
effective; support biodiversity, water 
and soil sustainability; and can help 
climate adaptation, e.g., with mangrove 

restoration helping to mitigate the 
impact of floods.

NCS can contribute to mitigating 
emissions in two ways: through the 
avoidance and reduction of emissions 
(caused by, for example, deforestation) 
and through the removal of emissions 
already in the atmosphere, such as 
reforestation and mangrove restoration. 
Both land-based and coastal- or 
ocean-based solutions, such as 
conserving saltmarshes and seagrass 
beds, can help with climate change 
mitigation.

Globally, net-zero pathways rely on 
the sequestration of carbon through 
natural solutions. In fact, NCS are 
estimated to have the potential to 
deliver up to one-third of the global net 
emissions-reduction requirements by 
2030. Countries such as the United 
Kingdom have already formulated 
comprehensive NCS road maps and 
achieved early wins (Exhibit 98). 

Natural solutions

Maximising carbon sequestration 
involves both conserving existing 
resources and restoring those that 
are depleted. India hosts some of the 
world’s most biodiverse ecosystems, 
such as the Himalayas and the Western 
Ghats and is home to several natural 
resources that can be leveraged 
to maximise carbon sequestration. 
The country has the tenth-largest 
forest area globally, with 72 million 
hectares of forested land.172

Despite ongoing deforestation, India’s 
forest cover has historically seen 
net growth, increasing from around 
20 percent of total area in 2000 to 
nearly 22 percent in 2020.173 India’s 
coastal mangrove forests amount to a 
total area of about 350,000 hectares.173 
The country also has a continuous 
coastline of about 5,500 km on the 
mainland and a total coastline of over 
7,500 km.174

Potential as estimated in India's submission to UNFCCC

India’s forests, wetlands and 
mangroves currently remove more 
carbon than they emit, leading to a net 
annual sequestration of 345 MtCO₂e 
(Exhibit 99). However, the country’s 
rapidly growing cities and farmlands are 
threatening these natural ecosystems. 
Despite net increase in forest cover, 
between 2001 and 2021, India has lost 
over two million hectares of tree cover, 
a 5.3 percent decrease since 2000, 
resulting in cumulative emissions of 
1 GtCO₂e.175

The LoS scenario

In the LoS scenario, India’s annual 
carbon sequestration from NCS 
could increase to roughly 411 MtCO₂e, 
assuming historical growth rates 
of forest and agroforestry.176 Over 
95 percent of this removal would come 
from land-based solutions; coastal 
or blue-carbon solutions are typically 
less mature and more expensive, and 

thus are not widely explored beyond 
currently available technologies.

Agroforestry would play a big role, 
accounting for nearly half of the total 
NCS potential. India’s agroforestry 
policy could see nearly a third of 
croplands used for regenerative 
farming practices, with the opportunity 
to create tree plantations on more than 
half of the country’s crop and pasture 
lands by 2050.177 This would replenish 
and augment the current stock of soil 
organic carbon.

While the solutions for the LoS scenario 
are known, focused implementation 
will still be required to deliver them. 
Policies such as the Green India Mission 
(GIM) and India’s Paris commitments 
would see both forest restoration and 
deforestation continuing at current 
rates, with positive actions undertaken 
only in areas that are economically 
feasible and not suited for agriculture.

The Accelerated scenario

In this scenario, conservation and 
restoration of natural sources could 
result in an additional 233 MtCO₂e 
sequestered annually by 2050.178 This 
translates to additional sequestration 
of around 2.5 GtCO₂e to 3GtCO₂e 
between 2020–2050, and over 
7GtCO₂e by 2070. Much of this is 
through land-based solutions—driven 
by forest conservation and large-scale 
adoption of agroforestry. These would 
contribute nearly 85 percent of the 
total NCS potential in the Accelerated 
scenario (Exhibit 100).

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth — Deforestation: Deforestation 
has caused nearly 50 MtCO₂e 
per annum in emissions since 
2000 in India.179 Five states 
combined—Assam, Mizoram, 
Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh 
and Manipur—contributed to 
60 percent of all forest loss. Over 
90 percent of deforestation is 
driven by the forestry sector (wood 
and non-wood products).180 In an 
economically feasible scenario, 
given that cropland conversion is 
an inevitable consequence of 

population growth, India could 
prevent at least half of its projected 
deforestation through conservation 
efforts.

 — Reforestation and densification: 
Countries that are closer to the 
equator (i.e., tropical biomes) are 
most efficient at removing CO₂ 
through reforestation. India’s 
forest sequestration potential is 
eighth-highest globally. Efficient 
reforestation would likely require 
the restoration of eight million 

hectares of forests—over ten 
percent of India’s current forest 
cover.181 To achieve this, the growth 
in forest cover would need to 
double as compared to the last 
decade (Exhibit 101). India made a 
commitment in Paris to increase 
total forest and tree cover to 
33 percent by 2030.182 Given the 
current forest cover of around 
22 percent and historical growth 
rate of 0.2 percent per annum 
from 2010–2020, India is currently 
not on track to meet this goal.183 

179   There has been around 1 GtCO2e in emissions from 2001 to 2020 due to deforestation.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthDensifying existing forests will play 
a crucial role, as moderately dense 
and very dense forests together 
constitute only half of India’s current 
forests.184 However, this has the 
potential to increase to 60 percent 
by 2050.185

 — Agroforestry: Planting trees 
in over 80 percent of India’s 
croplands could sequester around 
45 MtCO₂e to 50 MtCO₂e per 
year by 2050. Farmers could 
plant trees on croplands and 
pasturelands to reduce carbon 
emissions, provide windbreaks and 
shelter for crops, prevent erosion, 
diversify production and maintain 
soil moisture levels. Agroforestry 
can also increase farmer incomes 
and improve rural livelihoods by 

producing useful by-products, such 
as tree-borne oilseeds, fuel wood 
and animal fodder.

 — Regenerative farming: Using 

cover crops, sowing legumes on 
pasturelands and adopting zero 
or low tillage can help preserve 
soil biodiversity and improve soil 
organic-carbon stock. Adopting 
zero- or low-soil tillage in half of 
India’s croplands could remove 
134 MtCO₂e (over 40 percent) of the 
remaining 322 MtCO₂e emissions 
from agriculture by 2050 in the 
Accelerated scenario (Exhibit 102). 
Custom hiring of zero-tillage seed 
drills and tractors compatible with 
small farmers could help mitigate 
capital constraints.

 — Coastal and ocean-based (blue-
carbon) solutions: Blue-carbon 
solutions offer many co-benefits in 
addition to carbon sequestration. 
For example, mangroves preserve 
coastal habitats and enable 
nutrient retention in soil. They 
protect against climate adversities, 
such as storms, and have many 
socioeconomic benefits. Peat and 
other wetlands also have high value 
as wildlife habitats and preserve 
water quality, especially in cropland 
regions and downstream locations 
of fertilised croplands.

India has unique potential here, 
with several emerging blue-carbon 
solutions, such as farming seaweed 
and ocean fauna (Exhibit 103). 
Tapping into this opportunity would

Investments and other 
implications
In the Accelerated scenario, 
implementing NCS to the maximum 
potential will likely require a total 
investment of $160 billion by 2070—
almost two-and-a-half times the 
expected investment in the LoS 
scenario (Exhibit 104).

Accelerating NCS could help sequester 
additional carbon emissions of nearly 
12 GtCO₂e cumulatively by 2070—
7.2 GtCO₂e higher than in the LoS 
trajectory (Exhibit 105). This also offers 
numerous social and environmental 
benefits: biodiversity protection; 
air, water and soil sustainability; and 
mitigation of climate hazards like floods 
and storms.

1.  Economic feasibility refers to current costs of implementing the solution. Low score is assigned to high-cost solutions. Maturity refers to available technologies and 
tools to implement the solution. Resource availability is the extent of natural occurrence of the resource. E.g., mangroves are assigned a low score as the availability 
and potential for mangroves is limited compared to forests.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthNCS represent an attractive investment 
opportunity for both public and private 
stakeholders. Globally, large corporates 
are increasingly investing in NCS, 
motivated by various factors, including 
compliance with voluntary carbon 
targets, corporate social responsibility 
and consumer demand for green 
products.

India has seen a growing interest in 
NCS, with several corporations driving 
mangrove-restoration and forest-
conservation projects. However, 
accelerating conservation and 
restoration, against the backdrop of 
a fast-growing economy, will likely 
require institutional intervention and 
systemic enablers. These could include:

 — Setting up a domestic carbon 
market: NCS projects can be 
integrated with carbon exchanges, 
where credits from sequestered 
carbon are traded (Exhibit 108). 
This would create positive 
value for all stakeholders and 
act as an important enabler in 
implementing projects. Setting up 
a domestic exchange is crucial for 
India to retain both the carbon-
offset and economic benefits of 
trading credits. Please refer to 
the section “Develop a national 
carbon-exchange market” in the 
Sustainable Finance chapter for 
further details.

 — Establishing natural capital 

solutions as an investible asset 
class: NCS represent a new asset 
class with the potential to capture 
the intrinsic value of the natural 
world, and there are several 
examples to build on (Exhibit 109). 
Natural resources could become 
investible assets that provide 
financial capital; NCS projects could 
thus be leveraged as an asset class 
that generates economic value for 
investors. While various solutions 
are already being pioneered, India 
would likely require a regulatory 
and policy road map to establish 
natural capital as an accessible and 
valuable asset class.

Exhibit 108

A domestic carbon market could enable India to retain both the carbon offset and economic 
benefits of trading credits.

Example: 
a reforestation 
project in 
Colombia with 
‘VCS’ label1

South Pole 
designed a 
reforestation 
project of 
>1,000 ha in an 
area degraded by 
extensive cattle 
grasing and mining 
in Colombia; 
independent third-
parties, CCBA and 
VCS, validated the 
project design

Being a larger 
project developer, 
South Pole used 
the cashflow 
generated by the 
sale of carbon 
credits from earlier 
projects to fund 
this new carbon-
reduction project

During the 
project’s 
development, local 
workers were 
trained to prepare 
the soil and plant 
>20 local tree 
species to 
stimulate the 
ecosystem’s 
regeneration

South Pole sold 
carbon credits 
(i.e., offsets) to end 
buyers that want to 
reduce their net 
carbon footprint; 
the offset was then 
retired (so it could 
no longer be 
traded) and the 
end buyer claimed 
the impact

After 5–7 years of 
forest growth, the 
impact and 
additionality 
(i.e., sequestered 
carbon) was 
certified by CCBA 
and VCS, which 
then issued carbon 
credits; every 
5–7 years a new 
assessment will 
yield additional 
carbon credits 
(until full growth)

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth — Creating regional and local 

 — Unlocking blue carbon: Attaining 

road maps: While India’s state 
governments and city corporations 
have local environmental policies, 
targeted NCS action and road maps 
could be considered. For example, 
four mega projects, which together 
have the potential to deliver over 
a quarter of the total expected 
abatement from NCS by 2050, 
have been identified: agroforestry 
projects in Madhya Pradesh and 
Maharashtra, a peatland restoration 
project in Assam and a reforestation 
and forest conservation project 
in Andhra Pradesh (Exhibit 110). 
Likewise, city-level road maps are 
crucial for creating local carbon 
sinks and improving liveability and 
climate adaptability.

complete decarbonisation will likely 
require unlocking the full potential 
of India’s oceans. India is in prime 
position to become a front-runner 
in blue carbon. This would likely 
require regulatory support in the 
form of a comprehensive MPA policy 
to ramp up conservation efforts, 
increase investment in blue-carbon 
research and development and 
facilitate startups.

NCS could play a key role in India’s 
pathway to decarbonisation as they 
offer several benefits in addition 
to carbon sequestration. Although 
accelerating adoption in a fast-growing 
economy will likely be challenging, 
India could leverage NCS to fully reap 
the benefits of its natural resources 
through investments and project  
road maps.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth3.4   Carbon capture, utilisation and storage

176

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthA preliminary analysis suggests that 
3 GtCO₂e cumulative CCUS would 
require Capex of $1.3 trillion by 2070, 
of which about $0.5 trillion would be 
for carbon capture and the balance for 
transportation and storage in the hub 
model.190 

Enablers for creating substantial 
CCUS capacity include carbon 
pricing to compensate for high 
CCUS Opex ($49–$55/tCO₂). R&D 
investments to improve the efficacy and 
costs of CCUS will be important. Some 
governments—like Australia—have 
led the way in providing investment 
subsidies.191 Technologies may need to 
be scaled up to use captured carbon in 
cement, chemicals and synthetic fuels. 
Finally, exploration investments may 
be required to identify and develop the 
storage potential in saline aquifers. 
This could unlock an additional 
cumulative carbon storage potential of 
around 60 GtCO₂e for India.189

Key takeaways
India’s residual gross emissions will 
likely persist at around 1.4 GtCO₂e 
annually till 2050 in the Accelerated 
scenario, particularly from the hard-to-
abate sectors, i.e., agriculture, cement, 
chemicals and steel. CCUS can help 
reduce these emissions by 329 MtCO₂e 
per annum by 2050 and 403 MtCO₂e 
per annum by 2070.

Globally, CCUS is emerging as 
a viable solution, with 40 Mt per 
annum capture and storage capacity 
plants operational at pilot level and 
further capacity of 90 Mt per annum 
announced, despite the fact that it is 
currently not economically viable.188 In 
India, the viability of CCUS could be 
improved by creating hubs for large 
emitters close to storage locations.

We estimate that India could develop 
as many as five storage hubs that 
are within 500km of 70 percent of 
India’s point-source emissions. The 
captured carbon can be transported 
through pipelines to existing oil fields 
for storage. India’s cumulative storage 
capacity in oil fields is 3 GtCO₂e, 
which is about a quarter of the storage 
requirement of 11.3 GtCO₂e by 2070.189

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthContext 
In our LoS scenario, India will likely still 
emit roughly 1.4 GtCO₂e per annum in 
2050. This makes it imperative for India 
to explore carbon capture technologies 
like CCUS. 

Demand for CCUS is growing 
globally—with an announced capacity 
of 90 Mt per annum (two-and-a-half 
times the current installed capacity). 
To reach decarbonisation goals 
across countries, CCUS capacity must 
increase one-hundredfold by 2050. 
Over the past 20 years, natural-gas 

processing has been the primary 
industry using CCUS. However, new 
projects are extending CCUS into other 
industries, like chemicals, cement, 
steel and power. In addition, storage in 
subsurface hubs is being explored.

In India, CCUS could capture 
329 MtCO₂e per annum by 2050 and 
403 MtCO₂e per annum by 2070, 
particularly from hard-to-abate sectors 
such as cement, chemicals and oil and 
gas (Exhibit 111). 

Exhibit 111

CCUS could capture almost 330 MtCO2e per annum by 2050 and help
achieve decarbonisation.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthTo achieve this, action steps across 
all four CCUS could be considered 
(Exhibit 112).

There are three types of carbon-
emission sources192 based on the purity 
of CO₂ in their flue gas:

 — High-purity point sources  
(50–90 percent flue gas): 
ethanol, ammonia and natural gas 
processing;

 — Low-purity point sources (5–15 
percent flue gas): power stations 
and cement factories—classified as 
hard-to-abate sectors;

 — Diffuse sources or DAC:  

low-concentration CO₂ captured 
from ambient air; also required for 
negative emissions.

The concentration of CO₂ in the carbon 
source determines the technological 
requirements and chemistry for carbon 
capture (Exhibit 113).

Carbon capture. By using the right 
carbon-capture technology based on 
the CO₂ concentration at point sources, 
India can capture an estimated 11–11.5 
GtCO₂e cumulative emissions by 2070.

The current cost of carbon capture 
is high ($30–$90/tCO₂; $600 for 
DAC) but is expected to decline with 
advances in capture technologies 
(Exhibit 114). From 2014–2020, more 
than ten capture technologies have 
matured to a Technology Readiness

Transportation. Transporting captured 
carbon to storage or utilisation sites 
can be done via rail, trucks, ships and 
pipelines, with pipelines being the 
most cost-effective and scalable. The 
compression of captured carbon is 
an essential precursor to all modes of 
transportation, and with longer pipeline 
distances, additional compression 
stages may be needed. 

Storage potential. India has a storage 
potential of 3 GtCO₂e in existing 
oil fields, which could address the 
country’s carbon-storage demand until 
2045. To tackle the cumulative demand 
till 2070 of 11–11.5 GtCO₂e, further 
storage would need to be identified 
across the country. It is estimated that 

there is 60 GtCO₂e storage potential 
in saline aquifers in India, which 
will require further exploration and 
assessment.194 

For India, a CCUS hub model could be 
the most cost-effective way to capture 
and transport carbon from multiple 
point sources to storage sites. Five 
hubs close to storage sites and the right 
pipeline network could accommodate 
25–30 percent of India’s point-source 
emissions within 300 km and 65–70 
percent within 500 km. The hubs would 
need to be in Gujarat, Maharashtra, 
Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, 
optimally positioned near oil fields, the 
coastline or potential storage sites in 
saline aquifers (Exhibit 116).

synfuel), EOR, biochar and greenhouse fertilisation have limited current potential while newer uses like construction materials 
(artificial limestone and carbon-cured cement), chemicals (plastics) are still in the early stages of development (Exhibit 118).

 — Innovative business models such 
as CCUS-as-a-service, cluster 
integrator (for distributed point 
source emissions in a hub) and 
transportation and compression 
pure play could be potential 
business models for CCUS in 
India. Further, carbon removal 
technologies such as bio-energy 
CCS (BECCS) and DAC could 
also get incremental support for 
advancement through advance 
market commitment mechanisms 
such as Frontier Climate.

 — Policy interventions could help 
increase CCUS investment and 
adoption in India and potentially 
reduce costs. For example, a 
carbon price (likely more than 
$75–$100/tCO₂) could spur hard-
to-abate industries to decarbonise. 
A negative emissions market 
(including voluntary offsets) may 
incentivise producers to capture 
biogenic carbon (as is done in 
trading schemes in China and 
Korea).195 Regulatory de-risking 
could support large-scale CO₂ 
storage throughout the asset life of 
50–100 years.

 — Storage potential exploration 

and assessment of saline aquifers 
would likely be needed to meet the 
storage demand.196 

Investment implications
Capture makes up the majority of 
CCUS costs. Capex across capture, 
transportation and storage adds up 
to $1130 billion by 2070 for a 300 km 
network and $1320 billion for a 500 km 
network (Exhibit 119). Utilisation costs 
have not been estimated in the analysis.

Proposed enablers to drive 
CCUS in India
While it is an expensive alternative 
for reducing emissions, CCUS is an 
important decarbonisation lever, 
particularly for hard-to-abate sectors 
like cement and steel. Possible 
unlocks include policies, technology 
development and storage assessment.

 — Technological advancements in 
carbon capture and utilisation 
could also significantly reduce 
costs, e.g., a significant DAC cost 
reduction could help capture 
fugitive emissions and enable India 
to decarbonise by 2050.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth187

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth4. Implications of India’s decarbonisation 

pathways on emissions, energy 
systems, land use, people and benefits

Other benefits from Accelerated 
decarbonisation. While the primary 
benefit of decarbonisation would be 
the ability to arrest climate change, the 
transition offers other benefits, too. It 
would result in localisation of India’s 
energy requirement with the shift 
from coking coal, oil, gas to renewable 
energy, green hydrogen and biomass, 
all of which would strengthen energy 
security. This could result in Forex 
savings of $2.4–3.0 trillion. Further, 
India could also establish a global 
manufacturing hub for green H2, solar 
panels, etc. and become a global leader 
and exporter of green technologies.

Land use implications. Currently, 
23 percent of available land is forest 
area, 59 percent is agricultural and the 
remaining 18 percent is used for non-
agricultural purposes, grazing pastures 
and barren land.198 Accelerated 
decarbonisation will likely require 
additional land for carbon sinks and 
renewable power. This is in addition 
to the land needed for continued 
urbanisation and industrial growth. 
Our estimates indicate a shortfall 
of 45 million ha of land by 2070 (15 
percent of total available land). India 
would need to implement efficient land 
use practices such as alternative land 
uses for barren land, vertical farming, 
urban carbon sinks, offshore wind and 
rooftop solar expansion.

Implications for people. A critical 
consideration is the impact the 
Accelerated scenario could have 
on the average Indian household’s 
spending requirement. We estimate 
that there will not be a major impact on 
overall spending since food spending 
sees no major impact, spending 
requirements for energy and transport 
see a reduction, only housing becomes 
slightly more expensive. Further, in 
the Accelerated scenario more than 
30 million jobs could be transformed 
(24 million new jobs could be created 
while 6 million existing jobs could be 
lost) by 2050.199 However, this number 
is small in the context of the macro 
trends affecting India’s workforce (e.g., 
60 million people will join the workforce 
and 30 million people will shift from 
farm jobs to non-farm jobs by 2030).200

Key takeaways 
India’s GHG emissions would likely 
increase to 11.8 GtCO₂e per annum 
by 2070 even assuming continued 
emission intensity reduction at the 
current rate. The LoS scenario would 
likely reduce the absolute emissions 
to 1.9 GtCO₂e per annum by 2070 
leading to an estimated cumulative 
carbon saving of 207 GtCO₂e by 2070.
The Accelerated scenario would likely 
create a further carbon saving of 
80 GtCO₂e cumulatively by 2070.197 
Seven levers that could contribute to 
83 percent of the emission reduction 
are: renewable energy, electrification 
of mobility, use of hydrogen, 
sustainable agriculture practices, 
material circularity, natural climate 
solutions and CCUS.

Implications for energy systems. 
In the LoS scenario, coal would 
likely decline from the 45 percent of 
the energy mix today to 26 percent 
and oil would likely reduce from 
26 percent to 21 percent by 2050. 
In the Accelerated scenario, the decline 
would be much steeper as coal’s and 
oil’s share in the energy mix would 
likely reduce to three percent and ten 
percent, respectively, by 2050. In the 
Accelerated scenario, 182 Mt per 
annum of refining capacity would need 
to be repurposed or stranded by 2040. 
By 2050, coal consumption would 
likely be reduced to a tenth of current 
consumption and all current coal-
based power capacity would need to 
be decommissioned. Scarce feedstock 
would need to be directed to the right 
use, for instance, the biomass currently 
being used for the power sector and 
the agri-based fuels for the transport 
sector might need to get directed to the 
hard-to-abate sectors like steel and 
aviation, respectively.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthSituation today 
India has reduced its emissions 
intensity of GDP by 1.3 percent per 
annum over the last decade. However, 
this pace is insufficient to reduce 
India’s absolute emissions given the 
fast-paced growth of GDP. India’s 
GHG emissions would likely increase 
to 11.8 GtCO₂e per annum by 2070 
assuming the current rate of emissions 
intensity. In the LoS scenario, absolute 
emissions could continue to rise and 
then decrease to 1.9 GtCO₂e per annum 
by 2070; a 90 percent reduction in the 
GDP emissions intensity versus 2019. 
The Accelerated scenario could further 
close the gap to net zero, reducing 
absolute emissions to 0.4 GtCO₂e; 

a 98 percent reduction in emissions 
intensity by 2070 versus 2019. The LoS 
scenario could create a cumulative 
carbon space of 207 GtCO₂e by 2070 
over the improving intensity line, 
while the Accelerated scenario could 
create a further carbon space of 80 
GtCO₂e cumulatively by 2070 (Exhibits 
120, 121).201 These emissions have 
been estimated with largely currently 
feasible technologies. It is expected 
that India could get to its net-zero-
by-2070 commitment on the back of 
its upcoming technology developments 
over the next decades (e.g., direct air 
capture).

The challenge of rapid 
decarbonisation
The LoS reductions are challenging; the 
Accelerated scenario’s is even more so. 
India has moved in several sectors at 
an enviable pace – renewables, energy 
efficiency, EVs, hydrogen. Results are 
there to see in the continued reduction 
in carbon intensity of GDP, and with 
several sectors poised for scale up. 
There are still major challenges to be 
overcome, but it is doable if early action 
to prepare for the transition is taken 
within this decade, given that a very 
large proposition of decarbonisation 
levers are in the money (Exhibit 123). 

For example, in the Accelerated 
scenario, renewables (wind and solar) 

capacity addition will likely need to 
increase from 10–12 GW per year today 
to 50 GW per year in 2030 and 90 GW 
per year in 2040. Ten times as much 
land as is used today would need to be 
found. Panels and corresponding raw 
material manufacturing would need to 
scale, given 80–90 percent of solar 
panels are imported currently.

In automotive, 100 percent of two 
wheelers, three wheelers and light 
truck sales would need to be electric 
early in the next decade, all car sales 
will likely have to be electric by 2035 
and trucks by 2050. For this, battery 
costs will likely decline by 40 percent 
in 2030 relative to today. Charging 
stations would need to increase 

13 times by 2030 and 40 times by 2040 
relative to today. Consumer financing, 
given higher up front electric vehicle 
costs, and raw materials for batteries 
would need to be found.

Green hydrogen, which is not 
economical until 2030 versus 
alternatives, will likely need a subsidy 
of $60–80/KW for electrolyser 
manufacturing and carbon prices 
(within this decade) to support uptake 
for its largest use case of green steel 
making. 29 GW of electrolysers would 
need to be installed by 2030 (relative 
to current deployment of about 1.4 
GW, globally)202 and almost 400 GW by 
2040.

Steel will likely see growth in hydrogen

green steel capacity from 0 today to 
152 Mt by 2040 while seeing an initial 
increase to 119 Mt by 2040 from 55 Mt 
in its BF-BOF capacity. It would also 
need to decrease its BF-BOF capacity 
to 85 Mt by 2040. 

The power sector will likely see a 
transition from the current coal power 
generation of 211 GW today to 120 GW 
by 2040 and 0 by 2050. This would 
need to be replaced by renewable 
power (solar + wind onshore) capacity 
of 480 GW and 1370 GW by 2030 and 
2040, respectively, versus 94 GW 
today.

Refining capacities will likely decrease 
from 213 Mt per annum today to 
114 Mt per annum by 2040 and 105 Mt 
per annum by 2050.

Additional land would likely be needed 
to meet India’s land requirements. This 
will be needed for agriculture (12 million 
ha by 2040), solar plants (5 million ha 
by 2040), forest densification (4 million 
ha by 2040), etc. However, land is not 
readily available so India will have to 
implement efficient land use practices 
to free up the necessary land.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthSeven key levers that could help 
accelerate decarbonisation
Our analysis shows that seven levers 
could help abate 83 percent of the 
emissions (Exhibit 124).

1. Expand renewable energy capacity: 
100 percent decarbonisation by 2050 
in the Accelerated scenario as opposed 
to by 2070 in the LoS scenario could 
result in abating 16 GtCO₂e by 2070. 
With wind- and solar-generation 
technologies already available at scale, 
power could be the quickest sector to 
decarbonise, potentially reaching net-
zero emissions by the mid-2050s.

India’s solar and wind capacity could 
increase from its current 95 GW203 
to 2700 GW by 2050, representing 
a 95 percent share of generation. 
This would likely need an acceleration 

in the annual build to 40–50 GW from 
the current 10 GW a year. Ex-bus 
bar solar tariffs are currently in the 
range of INR 2.0–2.5/kWh; lower 
than the marginal generation cost for 
60–70 percent of coal power plants.204 
This gap is likely to widen further. 
Transition to renewable sources of 
electricity could also decrease power 
generation costs from the current INR 
3.9/kWh to INR 2.9/kWh by 2050, 
with lower cost renewables and grid-
stabilising storage. To accelerate 
renewable energy production, India 
would likely have to quadruple the rate 
of capacity addition, resolve supply side 
bottlenecks (land, grid, etc.), accelerate 
market reforms and storage buildout 
(1200 GW by 2050) to integrate 
renewables and grid reliability, foster 
innovation and localise manufacturing. 

A quarter to two-fifths of the energy 
supply could be from infirm sources 
by 2030 in the LoS and Accelerated 
scenarios, respectively. The capacity 
in both scenarios could double in the 
decade of the 2030s and double again 
in the 2040s. The basics, including 
capacity-inducing and investment- 
reducing market reform, could be put in 
place now.

2. Increase penetration of EVs 
across vehicle types. Electrification 
of mobility is estimated to deliver 
7 GtCO₂e of cumulative abatement 
from now till 2070 between the LoS 
and Accelerated scenarios. This is 
underway due to advances in battery 
technology (storage capacity up two 
times, cost reduction of 17 percent 
every year over the last ten years). 
The sector benefits from government 

203   As of April, 2022.
204   Ex-bus bar tariff excludes the cost of transmission and distribution. Analysis based on the unit-level coal plant variable cost; Data from RE navigator and ministry of

In the LoS scenario, EV penetration reaches 100% only by 2070.
Includes other miscellaneous abatement levers such as 100% electrification of cooking, complete treatment of wastewater, improved energy 
efficiency in industry, and so on.

196

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthsupport (GST benefit of five percent 
for EVs versus 28–51 percent for ICE 
vehicles; schemes such as FAME and 
PLI to provide support).205 Perhaps the 
most important factor is an implicit 
carbon tax on transportation fuels of 
$140 to 240/tCO₂e.

In the Accelerated scenario, all new 
vehicle sales are assumed to shift 
to EVs fully around 2030 for two 
wheelers, around 2040 for cars 
and 2040–2050 for CVs. These 
assumptions are based on TCO parity 
which, in turn, needs to be balanced 
out by market maturity considerations. 
Typical maturity bottlenecks, which 
need to be solved for, include adequate 
availability of EV models, charging and 
swapping infrastructure maturity as 
well as incentive/dis-incentive schemes 
as proposed by the government. 
The infrastructure bottlenecks would 
need decadal Capex investments to 
the tune of $3 trillion for which green 
financing would need to be solved 
for. This transition would likely be 
enabled by: a) further reducing battery 
costs and fuel cells through at-scale 
localisation; b) providing continued 
government support through GST and 
FAME benefits and fossil fuel taxation; 
c) achieving the target modal mix of 45 
percent for rail freight by 2040; and 
d) focusing targeted affirmative action 
on select transitions, e.g., commercial 
fleets, especially HCVs.

3. Ramp up green hydrogen as 
fuel or feedstock: Hydrogen is a 
versatile energy source and chemical 
reductant. Adoption of green hydrogen 
could enable an annual abatement of 
900 MtCO₂e for India by 2050. This is 
subject to green hydrogen becoming 
cost competitive with alternative energy 
sources, which can be accelerated by 
faster R&D, adopting technology and 
ensuring early demand drives down 
costs. Green hydrogen demand would 
first emerge as a replacement for grey 
hydrogen in use cases such as refining, 

urea, methanol as it becomes more 
competitive versus grey hydrogen by 
2030. In our LoS scenario, hard-to-
abate sectors such as steel, automotive 
and power would drive demand only 
in the decade of the 2040s. These 
sectors have the potential to drive 
disproportionate demand for green 
hydrogen in the decade of the 2030s 
and 2040s with blending mandates and 
a carbon price of $50 per tonne.

Accelerating hydrogen adoption in 
steel-making will likely help India build 
the right assets. The steel industry 
could make an investment of about 
$265 billion over the next 30 years in 
the new BF-BOF capacity installation, 
which could risk getting stranded in 
case of climate shock, or early closure, 
even with India’s 2070 net-zero NDC. 
Indian steel makers could avoid this risk 
by investing early in green hydrogen-
based steel-making instead of the 
conventional blast furnace route to the 
tune of 200 Mt starting from 2030. 
This will likely need to be enabled by 
the right policies including a carbon 
price of $50/t, plans for which would 
have to be in place within two or 
three years for steelmakers to plan 
their investments. This could create 
additional carbon space of 3.1 GtCO₂e, 
and result in cumulative Forex savings 
of $420 billion in oil/gas imports and 
$280 billion in coking coal imports by 
2050.

4. Reform agriculture and dietary 
systems: Decarbonisation in the 
agriculture sector can lead to an annual 
carbon abatement of 292 MtCO₂e by 
2050, or nearly half of all expected 
annual emissions from agriculture. This 
would mainly be driven by sustainably 
cultivating rice (20 percent of 
abatement), reducing nitrate fertilisers 
(16 percent) and shifting towards 
sustainable consumer alternatives such 
as plant-based protein (15 percent) and 
millets (seven percent). 

Paddy farming and livestock account 

for 70 percent of agricultural 
emissions.206 Reducing paddy farming 
emissions by practicing rice-straw 
upcycling, dry seeding and SRI in 
half of India’s rice cultivated area 
and reducing livestock emissions by 
adopting efficient feeding and manure 
management practices for half the 
livestock population would be critical 
for decarbonising agriculture.

5. Drive material circularity: India 
currently generates 750–800 million 
tonnes of waste across waste streams 
with recycling rates of 13 percent for 
non-agricultural waste streams.207 
Improving recycling rates to 80 
percent could provide significant 
recycled raw material and help abate 
up to 34 GtCO₂e by 2070 in the 
Accelerated scenario (12 GtCO₂e 
more than the LoS scenario which 
takes into consideration recycling 
rates increasing to 55 percent). 
Recycled raw materials could help 
save 50–95 percent emissions in 
material production across steel 
(scrap-based EAF steel production), 
cement (recycled concrete, biomass 
fuels), plastic (recycled feedstock, 
recycled plastics), aluminium and other 
materials.208 While most technologies 
for recycling various waste streams 
already exist, driving material circularity 
would require investment in recycling 
infrastructure as well as enforcement 
of waste management and extended 
producer responsibility regulations. 
Demand signals would need to be 
created through recycled material use 
mandates. 

6. Sequestrate using NCS: NCS can 
help remove or sequester emissions 
through the conservation and 
restoration of nature. In the Accelerated 
scenario, India’s natural resources 
can sequester 640 MtCO₂e annually 
by 2050, nearly 300 MtCO₂e higher 
than 2019 levels and 230 MtCO₂e 
more than the LoS scenario. This 
translates to additional sequestration

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthof 3 GtCO₂e between 2020–2050, 
and 7 GtCO₂e by 2070 compared to 
the LoS scenario. Nearly 85 percent of 
sequestration would come from forests 
(avoiding deforestation, reforestation), 
agroforestry (trees in cropland, 
regenerative agriculture) and urban 
tree plantation. This would likely involve 
restoring an additional eight million 
hectares of forest (over ten percent 
of current forest cover) and practicing 
regenerative agriculture (such as low-
till farming) in at least half of India’s 
croplands, as opposed to 20–25 
percent adoption in an LoS scenario. 

7. Scale CCUS across industries: 
Adoption of new carbon-capture 
technologies could help reduce 
industrial emissions further, particularly 
for hard-to-abate sectors like cement, 
oil and gas and chemicals. CCUS 
could help capture 11.4 GtCO₂e across 
these sectors cumulatively by 2070 
for utilisation or storage. A hub model 
set-up for CCUS could be a cost-
effective approach and five hubs in 
India located close to storage could 
address 70 percent of point source 
emissions with a transportation radius 
of up to 500 kilometres. There could 
also be potential for utilising the 
captured carbon in applications 
like chemicals production, artificial 
limestone and construction blocks. 

CCUS is expensive and would lrequire 
significant investment and R&D to scale 
and become cost-effective.

Implications for energy 
systems
India depends on fossil fuels to meet 
approximately 75 percent of its current 
energy demand.209 This declines 
rapidly in both scenarios (Exhibit 125). 
For example, decarbonisation in the 
transportation sector would require 
shifting from petroleum-fueled cars to 
electric vehicles with electricity being 
increasingly supplied by renewable 
sources. The industry sector would 
shift from reliance on fossil fuels to 
a mix of electricity, hydrogen and 
biomass for manufacturing processes.

implications

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthIn agriculture, farm equipment 
would become electric. And, as India 
moves away from coal-based power 
generation to renewables such as solar 
and wind, the thermal coal demand 
would reduce drastically. The overall 
energy demand in the Accelerated 
scenario would likely be lower by 18 to 
24 percent between 2030 and 2050 
on account of higher energy efficiency, 
circularity and shifts in material use. 
This energy mix shift implies shifts in 
capacity including some which might 
strand some assets (stranded refining 
capacity, coal-based power plants and 
coal mining) and hence require support. 

a.  Refining capacity 

The oil and gas industry’s operations 
account for only five percent of total 
industrial emissions (about a percent 
and a half of India’s overall emissions), 
but it produces fuels which contribute 

to 18 percent of India’s total scope 
3 emissions. Given that over 80 percent 
of India’s crude consumption is 
imported, decarbonisation will have 
limited impact on the upstream sector 
(crude oil and gas production). 

In the LoS scenario, all new two-
wheelers and cars would likely be 
fully electric by 2040 and 2050, 
respectively. Additionally, by 2055–
2060, all new CVs would be electric too, 
resulting in a parc which would likely 
be 95 percent electric by 2070. This 
could reduce demand for refining since 
half of all oil products are consumed for 
mobility (Exhibit 126).

The expansion of refining capacity 
and increase in motor spirit (MS) and 
high-speed diesel (HSD) demand would 
continue until 2040. However, MS and 
HSD demand could peak in 2030 and 
2040, respectively, after which they 

210   McKinsey chemical insights HSM – Forecast for India.

may decline due to the electrification of 
vehicles. Liquified petroleum gas (LPG) 
demand could decline after 2030 due 
to the electrification of cooking and 
be phased out by 2070 with complete 
electrification. Meanwhile, the demand 
for aviation fuel would likely grow at a 
CAGR of three and a half percent but 
could be gradually substituted by SAF 
to achieve 50 percent blending by 
2070. Naphtha demand could grow at 
a CAGR of four and a half percent from 
2030–2050, and 2.3 percent from 
2050–2070, due to the increasing 
demand for petrochemicals in the LoS 
scenario.210 However, the effective 
demand would be lower due to the 
increase in recycling activity.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthThe demand for petrochemicals can 
play a crucial role in determining the 
required refining capacity to produce 
petrochemical feedstock. Hence, 
despite the phaseout of petrol and 
diesel, 147 Mt per annum of refining 
capacity would likely be required to 
meet naphtha demand till 2070. Overall, 
150 Mt per annum of refining capacity 
could be repurposed or stranded by 
2060 (Exhibit 127) in the LoS scenario.

In the Accelerated scenario, all new 
two-wheelers and cars would likely 
be fully electric by 2035 and 2045, 
respectively. Additionally, by 2045, all 
new CVs could be electric, resulting in 
a parc which would likely be more than 
95 percent electric by 2050. As a result, 
demand could see decline and 182 Mt 
per annum of refining capacity would 
need to be repurposed or stranded by 
2040 (Exhibit 127).

However, both central and state 
governments could fill up revenues 
from liquid fuel taxes and dividends 
from state-owned enterprises(SOEs) in 
the petroleum sector, which accounted 
for approximately INR 5.6 lakh crore 
(total contribution to central and state 
exchequer) in FY 2019–20.211

Some of the largest companies in 
India are refiners. They would need to 
take action to protect their value as 
this transition takes place. Petrol and 
diesel—which typically account for 
around half of refinery production—
would give way to naphtha (for 
chemicals), aviation turbine fuel (ATF) 
and biofuels production as the primary 
sources of revenue.

 — Gradually shift from crude 

processing to petrochemicals 
production. The demand for 
fossil fuels may decline but the 
demand for petrochemicals could 
increase with GDP growth (Exhibit 
128). Hence, this is an opportunity 
for refiners to forward integrate 
into petrochemical complexes 
and chemicals manufacturing. 
For example, fluidised catalytic 
convertor modification and 
hydrocracker optimisation could 
deliver a 40 percent share of 
chemicals in existing refineries.212 
Greenfield refineries could be set 
up to produce 80 percent of the 
chemicals (such as the crude-
to-chemicals complex of a north 
American refinery player). Refiners 
could increase their gross refining 
margins from $6–8 per barrel to 
$20 per barrel by maximising their 
conversion to chemicals.

 — Repurpose existing refinery 
assets to produce green 
hydrogen, ammonia, synthetic 
fuels, SAF and other biofuels. 
Refineries have existing set ups for 
utilities, storage infrastructure and 
distribution that could be leveraged 
to become key players in the green 
hydrogen and ammonia supply 
chain.The fuel mix of bunkering 
is expected to shift to 25 percent 
ammonia213 and 11 percent hydrogen 
by 2050214 and coastal refineries 
with storage infrastructure could 
potentially become bunkering 
hubs for supplying green fuel 
to the shipping industry. Green 
hydrogen can also be used to 
produce synthetic fuels using 
captured carbon from the refinery. 
Demand for SAF could rise as 
blending mandates are enforced 

to decarbonise the aviation sector. 
India has the potential to produce 
14 Mt per annum of SAF across 
multiple pathways (such as Gas-FT 
and alcohol-to-jet fuel) by 2050 
and could become a global supply 
hub with an SAF-production surplus 
of 5 Mt per annum by 2040 in the 
Accelerated scenario.

b.  Coal mining and coal-based 

power plants

  Coal accounts for 45 percent of 

the country’s energy needs.215 The 
sector has played a significant 
role in job creation and local 
development, particularly in the 
coal-producing and mining states 
of Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, 
West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and 
Telangana. Almost 80 percent of 
domestic coal is consumed by the 

power sector, seven percent by 
steel, five percent by cement and 
the remainder is used as fuel for 
industrial applications.216

In the LoS scenario, coal’s share in 
the primary energy mix is expected 
to decline from its current 45 
percent to 26 percent by 2050; 
in the Accelerated scenario, it 
could drop to two percent by 2050 
(Exhibit 125). Most of this decline 
is driven by the power sector’s 
shift to renewable energy sources. 
The remaining coal used to make 
steel and generate heat in cement 
production would likely be phased 
out over time, as the consumption 
of green fuels such as electricity, 
hydrogen and bioenergy increases.

Coal capacity in power generation 
currently stands at 211 GW. 80 percent 
of this capacity has been set up 
between 2010 and 2020, with about 
30 GW of additional capacity being 
planned by 2030. Since India’s coal 
fleet is relatively young, it is expected 
to remain operational until 2050. 
About 46 GW of capacity in the LoS 
scenario and all the current 211 GW 
in the Accelerated scenario could 
be at risk for closure and require 
decommissioning by 2050 (Exhibit 
130).

The transition would also impact 
coal demand in other sectors. Steel 
production, for example, uses around 
73 Mt of coal annually in blast furnaces. 
That could be completely phased out 
by 2070 as a result of accelerated 

decarbonisation. Likewise, the cement 
sector currently uses 47 Mt of coal that 
could be entirely substituted by green 
fuels by 2050.217 

In India, petrochemical imports stood at 
$40 billion (FY2019) and were expected 
to reach $75 billion by FY2025.218 
The sector is heavily dependent on 
imports of crude/petrochemicals and 
coal gasification can enable India’s 
transition to a chemical manufacturing 
hub while developing alternative uses 
for domestic coal. Coal gasification is 
technically and commercially proven 
but the overall profitability of the coal 
to chemicals project would depend 
on both the price of crude oil and coal 
in future. China has been using it to 
produce large quantities of chemicals, 
fertilisers, etc.219 GHG emissions are 

higher for coal-based chemicals, which 
can be mitigated by mandating new 
capacity to include carbon capture and 
storage (adds five percent to capital 
costs) and the remaining emissions may 
be mitigated by carbon offsets.220 India 
has made initial progress by setting up 
pilot plants in Talcher (coal to fertiliser) 
and Dankuni (coal to methanol).221 It has 
also announced a vision of 100 Mt Coal 
Gasification by 2030 (National Coal 
Gasification Mission by the ministry 
of coal) to find an alternative use for 
coal and utilise the natural resources 
available in the country.222 Our LoS 
and Accelerated scenarios have not 
considered this alternative use of coal.

c.  Use of biomass and  
agri-based fuels 

Increasing the use of carbon-neutral 
biomass (agricultural crop residue) 
is critical for decarbonising India, 
especially in the hard-to-abate 
sectors. India currently produces 
close to 500 Mt of crop residue out of 
which 110 Mt can be made available 
for biofuel production (bioethanol),223 
biomass-based power generation and 
fuel for the industrial sectors such as 
steel and cement. 250 Mt of the crop 
residue is used as cattle feed and 
the remaining 140 Mt is not managed 
actively/mismanaged.224 The biofuels 
usage envisaged for the future is a 
fundamental transformation of how 
agricultural residue would be used 
in the future versus how it is directly 
burned today.

The National Policy on Biofuels (2018) 
has mentioned targets of blending 
20 percent of bioethanol into petrol 
and five percent of biodiesel into diesel 
by 2030 which could incentivise the 
utilisation of biomass for liquid fuel 
production. Bioethanol as a petrol 
substitute is a credible alternative 
for the short term. In the medium-
term, liquid low-carbon fuels (from 
bagasse) could be used. And, in the 
long term, electrification could drive the 
decarbonisation of transport (except 
for heavy trucking). Carbon-neutral 
biomass could be prioritised for the 
cement, steel and aviation sectors 
through regulatory support like RDF 
usage in cement kilns. 

In the Accelerated scenario, 600 Mt 
of crop residue is expected to be 
generated in India in 2050 of which 
315 Mt would be utilised as cattle 
feedstock. 120 Mt would be needed for 
soil-based carbon sequestration using 
bio-decomposers. Of the remaining 
165 Mt, 45 Mt could be prioritised for 
cement/steel and 60 Mt for biomass-
based power generation. This would 
leave only 60 Mt of carbon-neutral 
biomass available for SAF. SAF would 
likely require 130 Mt of feedstock and to 
meet the balance 70 Mt, organic MSW 
would need to be utilised.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthImplications for land use
India has a total land area of 329 million 
ha, out of which 21 million ha is 
inland water, leaving a total available 
land mass of 308 million ha. Today, 
23 percent of this available land is 
forest area, 59 percent is agricultural 
and the remaining 18 percent is used 
for non-agricultural purposes, grazing 
pastures and barren land.225 As India 
grows in a sustainable fashion in the 
Accelerated scenario, it will likely need 
land not only for urbanisation and an 
increase in industrial and agricultural 
output but also for renewable power 
capacity installation, carbon sinks, 
biomass, etc. 

Based on current land usage practices, 
we estimate that the total increased 
land area requirement would be 
45 million ha in 2050 versus today 
(Exhibit 131). However, this land is not 
readily available and India may have to 
implement efficient land use practices 
to ensure necessary land is made 
available. These measures would need 
to be innovative and could possibly 
include alternative land uses for barren 
land, vertical farming, urban carbon 
sinks, offshore wind and rooftop solar 
expansion.

The following solutions could be 
considered to unlock India’s land 
efficiency:

 — Increased agricultural 

productivity: Adopting sustainable 
and higher-yield farming practices 
like converting long-term fallows to 
current fallows and bringing them 
under cultivation could provide 
15 million hectares of land.

 — Barren land use: Barren land can 
be utilised for different purposes 
like installing solar and wind power 
plants or new industrial plants and 
could cater to 11 million hectares of 
incremental requirement.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth — Denser forests and urban forests 

to meet carbon-sink goals: Denser 
forests, increased agroforestry 
and urban tree cover could meet 
carbon-sink targets, as there is 
not sufficient forest area available 
to meet the Paris commitment of 
33 percent land under forest cover; 
denser forests could provide land 
efficiency of 5.6 million hectares.

 — Vertical urbanisation: Urbanising 
existing built-up areas, creating 
higher population densities in towns 
and cities, instead of increasing 
overall built-up area could provide 
2 million hectares of land.

These measures could help acquire 
34 million ha of additional land but 
a further 11 million ha would still be 
needed. To acquire this remaining 
land, expensive routes like artificial 
islands and land reclamation could be 
considered. 

India can consider establishing a nodal 
authority to define a national land use 
plan, lay out clear land-use guidelines 
and mandates for optimised use across 
urbanisation, industrial needs, carbon 
sinks, agriculture and renewables. The 
nodal body can make trade-offs and 
enable efficient land use in consultation 
with states (‘land’ being a state subject). 
It would be essential to have a long-
term outlook to balance the growing 
need for land across sectors. Finally, 
policies would be needed to ensure 
efficient land use across sectors.

Implications for people
 — Household spending: A critical 
consideration is the impact 
accelerated decarbonisation 
will have on the average 
Indian household’s spending 
requirements. To estimate 
this impact, we have used the 
Empowerment Line226 that assesses 

what constitutes a meaningful, 
economically-empowered standard 
of living. 

Spending on food, which represents 
over 40 percent of the total 
spending requirement, is likely 
to have no major impact as the 
incremental Capex expenditure in 
agriculture could be offset by cost 
savings from sustainable practices 
and improved productivity. Energy 
spending could be reduced as the 
faster expansion of renewable 
energy can help lower power 
generation costs (current INR 3.9/
kWh to INR 2.9/kWh by 2040). 
Housing spending could increase 
with the rise in steel and cement 
prices but the overall impact 
on construction costs would be 
limited to two or three percent by 
2040. Other spend categories 
such as transport could also be 
reduced as the shift to EVs from the 
current ICE vehicles would lead to 
operational savings. Having said 
that, financing would be needed 
for the higher upfront cost of EVs. 
Moreover, faster EV adoption in 
light commercial vehicles could 
help reduce the logistics cost for 
goods and services consumed 
by households. In conclusion, our 
analysis suggests that there will 
not be a major impact in overall 
spending requirements227 as a result 
of accelerated decarbonisation by 
2040 (Exhibit 13).

 — Jobs: The Accelerated scenario is 
expected to impact jobs and skills 
requirements across sectors as 
they decarbonise. India’s coal mines 
are estimated to employ around 
0.35 million workers currently. 
Additionally, more than 1.7 million 
people are indirectly dependent 
on the coal sector.228 The phasing 
out of coal as India decarbonises 

would need to be supported by 
new businesses that support 
the transition for this workforce. 
Further, all current coal-based 
power plant capacity (211 GW) 
could be closed by 2050 in this 
scenario. However, the power 
sector would likely see an uptick 
in employment with jobs moving 
from non-renewable energy plants 
to jobs in solar and wind projects. 
Overall, there could be a shift of jobs 
from coal rich eastern India to high 
renewable potential southern and 
western India. 

The Indian public sector companies 
in the Oil and Gas sector employ 
0.1 million workers currently with 
more than half of these jobs in 
refining and marketing.229 As two-
thirds of the 2030 refining capacity 
could be stranded by 2050 in the 
Accelerated scenario, the workforce 
in this sector could have trouble 
transitioning, even with the potential 
repurposing of the stranded 
refining capacity. The automobile 
industry would also see a shift 
from ICE to EV manufacturing 
roles. Similarly, steel and cement 
would also see restructuring from 
BF-BOF to hydrogen-based green 
steel and the adoption of new raw 
materials for clinker development, 
respectively. 

  Overall, the accelerated 

decarbonisation of India is expected 
to transform more than 30 million 
jobs230 (24 million new jobs could 
be created while six million existing 
jobs could be lost) by 2050.231 
However, this number is small in 
the context of the macro trends 
affecting India’s workforce as 
outlined in Exhibit 133.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth — Policy implementation: 

Methodical implementation of 
current policies would be critical 
if the LoS scenario is to hold. 
Similarly, the pace of the new policy 
launch as well as the timing and rate 
of implementation could impact the 
Accelerated scenario.

 — Others: Certain other factors such 
as availability of green finance, the 
careful implementation of a just 
transition, competitive dynamics 
from the changing energy mix, etc. 
could have an impact on scenario 
evolution.

Pathway uncertainties
Both the LoS and Accelerated 
scenarios depend heavily on green 
technologies being adopted, cost 
curves evolving and necessary policy 
frameworks being implemented. 
The LoS scenario relies upon the 
adoption of existing and upcoming 
technologies for decarbonisation 
based on today’s cost projects and 
current and announced policies to 
drive decarbonisation (FAME, Green 
Hydrogen policy, etc.). While in the 
Accelerated scenario, a faster adoption 
of the lower-cost technologies is 
assumed with a correspondingly faster 
decline in the cost of new technologies 
and implementation of stricter policies 
such as carbon price, blending 
mandates, etc. A few factors could 
evolve differently in the future which 
would have a major impact on how the 
path evolves:

 — Evolution path of existing 

technologies: Both the LoS 
and Accelerated scenarios have 
projections regarding timelines 
and cost curve evolution of existing 
technologies such as green 
hydrogen, battery, offshore wind, 
etc. Depending on technology 
developments in the next ten years, 
current projections might change.

 — Development of new 

technologies: The Accelerated 
scenario relies heavily on certain 
technology breakthroughs such as 
direct air capture and utilisation, 
low-cost storage for carbon 
capture, non-lithium long duration 
storage, blue-carbon capture, etc. 
The pathways outlined in the report 
depend on innovation and R&D in 
these areas.

Resultant benefits accrued 
from decarbonisation 
While the primary benefit of 
decarbonisation is the ability to arrest 
climate change and reduce global 
warming, this transition offers a series 
of other benefits to the country that it is 
important to recognise. In our analysis, 
we have identified the following 
additional benefits:

 — Energy import reduction and 

energy security. Decarbonisation 
would result in the localisation of 
India’s energy requirements with 
the shift from coal, oil and gas to 
renewable energy, green hydrogen 
and biomass. This would likely imply 
a huge reduction in coal (184 Mt) 
and oil imports (145 tons) by 2050 
with a corresponding increase in 
lithium-ion batteries and modules, 
cells, turbines for renewable energy.

 — Substantial Forex savings. The 
import reduction could bring 
substantial Forex savings for the 
government, i.e., $1.5–1.8 trillion 
from reduction in oil imports, 
$0.4–0.6 trillion from reduction 
in natural gas imports and $0.8–
1.0 trillion from reduction in coking 
coal imports. However, there could 
also be an increase of $0.3 trillion 
in battery imports and $0.3 trillion 
in solar panels. This could be 
reduced by intensively focusing on 
indigenous manufacturing with the 
help of initiatives such as PLIs, etc.

 — Leadership opportunities. There 
would be the opportunity to use 
India’s huge demand to catalyse the 
development of globally competitive 
cleantech industries and give India 
the opportunity to lead the world. 
India could establish a global 
manufacturing hub for green H2, 
solar panels, etc. and become 
a global leader and exporter of 
green technologies such as green 
H2, green steel, green pig-iron, 
SAF (5.5 Mt of annual SAF export, 
worth $5.5 billion) and storage 
technologies not based on lithium 
or carbon.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth5. Financing India’s decarbonisation

to greener technology at a time when 
India will likely add a lot of capacity, thus 
preventing a lock into fossil fuel-based 
technologies (e.g., for steel). 

Banks, a major funding source, could 
define glide paths for their financed 
emissions and set ambitious targets 
for financing new green businesses. 
Institutional measures like shaping 
banking regulations towards transition 
financing and setting up a green 
transition bank to orchestrate capital 
are greatly required to fast-track 
decarbonisation.

Key takeaways
Financing decarbonisation will be 
an acute challenge for India. India 
will need an estimated $7.2 trillion232 
in green investments until 2050 to 
decarbonise in the LoS scenario 
and an additional $4.9 trillion for 
the Accelerated scenario (about 
3.5 percent233 and 2.4 percent of India’s 
GDP through this period, respectively).

The investments required are front-
loaded; India would have a runway till 
2040 to orchestrate half of the total 
$12.1 trillion required by 2050. The 
balance half of the investments would 
be required in the decade of the 2040s. 
However, decarbonisation could 
decrease operating costs by $2.1 trillion 
by 2050, mostly in the decade of the 
2040s, thus easing cash needs.

50 percent of the abatement 
required for decarbonisation is ‘in 
the money’, with a majority related 

to renewable energy, automotive and 
agriculture. However, current annual 
financing for decarbonisation meets 
only 10–12 percent ($44 billion234 in 
FY2019–20) of the investment demand 
in the Accelerated scenario. 

Despite the positive return profile for 
most cases, financing is constrained 
due to real and perceived risks (e.g., 
technology risks, payment risks, 
project execution, policy stability) 
and structural constraints (e.g., 
investor expectation mismatch, limited 
participation from the Indian banking 
sector).

India needs an aligned, cross-
sectoral, top-down plan for its 
decarbonisation, cascaded into the 
right industrial policies. One of these 
could be to accelerate the nationwide 
compliance carbon market to fast-track 
green investment and increase the flow 
of capital toward hard-to-abate use 
cases. This could also help the move

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthAccelerated decarbonisation will likely 
create operational cost savings236, 
such as lower costs of power 
generation due to increased solar 
penetration. As a result, some portion 
of the additional investment could 
be recuperated through operating 
cost savings. From now until 2050, 
operating costs could lead to overall 
savings of $2.1 trillion, offsetting about 
45 percent of the capital investments 
over this period (Exhibit 136). 

Proposed investment needed 
for India’s decarbonisation
This transition will likely require 
$7.2 trillion to be invested235 in 
green technologies till 2050 for 
the LoS scenario and an additional 
$4.9 trillion for the Accelerated 
scenario (3.5 percent and 2.4 percent, 
respectively, of cumulative GDP for the 
period) (Exhibit 134).

Investment for the power sector 
includes green Capex on low carbon 
emission power generation such as 
solar and its supporting infrastructure. 
Similarly, investment for industry 
considers additional green capacity via 
technologies such as hydrogen-based 
steel production. Mobility investment 
includes Capex for EVs (including 
incremental Capex for the vehicle), 
SAF production units and supporting 
infrastructure. Agriculture investment 

includes Capex in electric tractors 
and installation of equipment for 
the green transition in agriculture. 
Other investments include Capex 
in green hydrogen (electrolyser 
manufacturing, pipeline and storage 
infrastructure), CCUS (setting up 
capture, transportation and storage 
infrastructure for CO₂) and material 
circularity (infrastructure for waste 
management and segregation).

In both scenarios, about 70 percent 
of the capital investment would 
be required for decarbonising the 
power and automotive sectors, with 
agriculture and industry making up 
a quarter of the overall estimated 
investments (Exhibit 135).

235   Calculations for sectors across the LoS and Accelerated scenarios is based on bottom-up investment analysis for green/low emission levers and supporting 

infrastructure. Non-green / high-emission ongoing capex has not been considered in the capex numbers above.

236   Opex calculations for each sector and cross-cutting theme have been done irrespective of green or non-green technologies to demonstrate overall incremental 

savings due to accelerated decarbonisation.

2.
3. Others includes cross-cutting themes, i.e., hydrogen ($189 bn) and circular economy ($185 bn) in LoS.
4. Total production capex involved in agriculture, including factor costs and green levers.

Between the Accelerated and LoS 
scenarios, two-thirds of the emissions 
could be abated at negative or low cost 
(<$10/tCO₂e) and 50 percent of the 
emissions could be abated through 
in-the-money levers (Exhibit 138 – 
MACC237 curve). This is because the 
cost of decarbonisation is expected 
to decline as technologies mature. 
Solar energy, wind power and EVs, 
that comprise the first quintile of the 
abatement potential, present a very 
positive investment case. 

The levers in the last quintile are the 
high-cost ones, comprising some 
advanced agriculture practices, 
offshore wind, CCUS, which could 
cost more than $60 per tCO₂e and 
would likely need demand signals 
to be set up. Hydrogen-based steel 
could cost $47/tCO₂e till 2040. From 
2040–2070, it could cost $9.6/tCO₂e. 
An estimated carbon price of $40–50/
tCO₂e could potentially drive domestic 
carbon credits generation by making all 
sequestration levers cost competitive 
(100 percent sequestration levers are 
cost competitive at $35 per tCO₂e).

Source: Bottom-up models for sectors

However, the cost savings are not 
balanced across sectors (Exhibit 137). 
Power invests an incremental 
$1.3 trillion over this time frame 
for the Accelerated over the LoS 
scenario, while saving $0.5 trillion 
in operating costs; transportation 
invests an incremental $2.3 trillion, 
while saving $1.9 trillion; agriculture 
invests an incremental $0.05 trillion, 
while saving $0.3 trillion. On the other 
hand, industries like steel and cement 
invest $0.9 trillion, with a simultaneous 
increase in costs ($0.2 trillion); other 
levers such as NCS and material 
circularity would require investments 
of $0.1 trillion while saving $0.3 trillion 
(Exhibit 137).

Spending on physical assets in Accelerated scenario, minus those in the LoS scenario for capex and vice versa for opex; excluding opex reduction in refining sector 
(which is mainly due to reduction of the refining activity).
Estimation of capex includes spending on physical assets in power, mobility, steel, cement, agriculture, CCUS, hydrogen, circular economy and other industries. 
Estimation of opex includes spend for physical assets across various forms of energy supply (e.g., power systems, hydrogen, and fuel supply), energy demand (e.g., 
for vehicles, alternate methods of steel and cement production), and various forms of land use (e.g., GHG-efficient farming practices).
Calculated as spending on physical assets net of operating costs in that period, divided by GDP in the period. GDP is for the cumulative GDP from 2021-2050 is 
taken directly from IHS-Markit.
Savings from one sector may not directly compensate for capex requirement of other sectors and numbers shown present a macro-economic view for the nation.
Potential revenue from levers has not been captured.

The cost of decarbonisation is expected 
to decline as technologies mature – 
even in a high growth economy, as 
innovation and economies of scale 
lower technology costs over time. 
A portion of emission abatement levers 
considered in the Accelerated scenario 
(e.g., marine fuels, some advanced 
agriculture practices and electrification 
of high-temperature industrial heat) 
could remain high cost – and will likely 
require additional support to make 
happen.

More importantly, a large number 
of levers are not in the money in the 
initial decades of the 2020s and 
2030s (Exhibit 138). This could be 
an indication of the policy load in 
the early years to get the abatement 
engine primed up, through blending 
mandates, carbon prices and other, 
sector-specific policies. Additionally, 
external demand drivers could include 
supplying to regions like Europe, Japan 
and Korea, which are likely to have high 
carbon prices and border adjustment 
mechanisms, and would welcome  
green imports.

Challenges in financing 
this transition – incentivise 
capital providers across 
corporates, banks and 
investors
The current annual green financing 
market in India is estimated to be 
around $44238 billion across both 
debt and equity investments. This 
could increase to an annual spend of 
$160 billion per annum (4.1 percent 
of GDP) in the current decade, 
$440 billion in the 2030s (6.8 percent 
of GDP) and $610 billion in the 2040s 
(six percent of GDP) in our Accelerated 
scenario (Exhibit 134). Two-thirds of this 
spending will likely be needed even in 
the LoS scenario. This funding could 
be mobilised largely from the retained 
earnings of corporations, banks, public 
markets and the government. Private 
equity and sovereign wealth funds 
could have a smaller, but important, 
role to play. Challenges to raising this 
funding comprise: 

 — Delayed benefits, even for NPV 

positive levers: About 50 percent 
of the abatement levers (e.g., 
EV, RE), even between the LoS 
and Accelerated scnearios, are 
NPV positive. Yet, even for these 
positive levers, Opex savings kick 
in substantively only in the 2040s, 
while the investment is made in the 
prior decade, creating a cash flow 
mismatch for the economy. 

 — Uneconomic business cases 
responsible for a quarter of 
the abatement, such as CCUS, 
hydrogen-based green steel (till 
2045) and green hydrogen as a grey 
hydrogen replacement (till 2030).

 — Capital formation challenges for 
positive investment cases, due 
to both financial and structural 
constraints. These include 
payment-related risks (e.g., PPA239 
renegotiations as technology 
costs decline, payment delays by 
power distribution companies), 

project risks (e.g., land acquisition 
challenges, delays in grid 
connection) and currency risks for 
import dependent projects. 

 — Capital flows constrained by 

investors’ expectation mismatch: 
Most investor groups have a short-
term investment horizon, while 
green projects have long-term 
funding requirements (e.g., most 
solar/wind projects need financing 
for over 20 years while most bank 
borrowings are five years in tenure).

 — Limited participation from the 

Indian banking sector: There are 
very few banking regulations and 
incentives to drive sustainable 
finance in a scalable manner. 
As per the RBI ESG Survey 2022, 
45 percent of the boards of Indian 
banks have not discussed the need 
to increase green finance in the last 
two years.240

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthmarket-based adjustments—and many 
developing countries are now shifting 
to an exchange-based carbon-pricing 
mechanism. 

In the ETS, the regulator sets a 
cap of CO₂ to be emitted (overall or 
for a sector). Firms emitting lower 
emissions can sell their surplus 
quota in a regulated market to firms 
that need more allowances than 
originally received, leading to the 
formation of a price. This has proven 
to be the most effective way to 
reduce GHG emissions as can be 
seen in the example of European 
ETS (Box 2). By restricting the 
supply of allowances, higher 
carbon prices can prevail, providing 
critical economic signals for 
decarbonisation. 

India has already announced that 
it will transition its successful 
PAT scheme into a compliance 
carbon market.241 This is also being 
legislated as a part of the Energy 
Conservation bill, currently in 
Parliament. Carbon markets will 
likely need to be accelerated in India 
to build India right. For example, in 
the case of steel, without visibility 
into carbon pricing in the next two 
or three years, India will likely build 
and lock itself into long-lasting high 
carbon steel-making assets in the 
decade of the 2030s.

2 a.  VCMs for the short-term

In the short term, India could consider 
launching a VCM to build awareness, 
signal future policy intent and build 
the necessary capabilities and 
administrative muscle needed for 
launching and operating ETS. Carbon 
trading by tapping global VCM 
markets has already started gaining 
momentum in India – $300 million 
or about 60 MtCO₂e worth of carbon 
credits were exported from India across 
different VCMs in 2021.242 Multiple 
local initiatives are already running to 
generate value by selling carbon credits 
(e.g., the Indian Agricultural Research 

Institute is building a carbon credit 
market for Indian farmers in Punjab and 
Haryana).243

For setting up the VCM, India could 
consider:

 — Creating demand for VCMs in 
India: Increasing global carbon 
credit demand opens up an 
attractive opportunity. India’s own 
large medium-term demand for 
carbon credits would need support 
to materialise through advocacy and 
awareness.

 — Building a robust supply pipeline: 
India has robust supply, but project 
types need to shift from avoidance 
to removal. Most credits generated 
in India are from renewable energy 
projects, which are no longer 
accepted by many global standards. 
Robust demand signals would likely 
be needed to stimulate nature-
based and emerging technology 
projects.

 — Designing a VCM open to 

international participation, which 
may better support India’s NDCs 
since it could provide stronger 
returns to developers of carbon 
projects. The Paris Agreement’s 
Corresponding Adjustments (CAs) 
provision helps avoid double-
counting and allows voluntary 
cooperation in the implementation 
of countries’ NDCs to allow for 
higher ambition and promote 
sustainable development and 
environmental integrity. Companies 
buying international carbon credits 
on VCMs are unlikely to require 
CAs as the purchases are made to 
meet voluntary commitments and 
not their respective host countries’ 
NDCs. Allowing international trade 
of carbon credits could enable 
proponents of climate mitigation 
projects to receive robust prices 
and improve the financial prospects 
of such projects.

Proposed interventions could 
be considered to accelerate 
financing to support the 
green transition
Five important interventions could 
accelerate the availability of domestic 
and international funding. These 
include a national plan cascaded into a 
decarbonisation policy, carbon markets 
to get ideas into the money faster, glide 
paths for all banks, regulatory enablers 
for banks and a green bank. 

1.  A national plan to provide stability 
and direction for the investments 
to come 

An overarching Indiawide plan could 
be considered with an appropriate 
governance system to ensure 
coordination across ministries 
and external stakeholders in 
delivering net zero. Such a plan, 
with multiple horizons (five-, 15-, 
25-year), could form the basis for 
developing industrial policies which 
would enable the large industrial 
investments needed for India’s 
decarbonisation. In the absence of 
such a plan, the capacities could get 
built on legacy technologies (e.g., 
fossil fuel-based steel), or possibly 
capacities would not come, leading 
to shortages and higher prices. 

2.  Carbon markets to get ideas into 

the money faster

In order to accelerate the process 
of decarbonisation, India could 
explore three types of carbon-
pricing mechanisms that have been 
implemented globally—carbon tax, 
emissions trading systems (ETS) 
and voluntary carbon markets 
(VCMs). The first two are mandatory 
and enforced using regulatory 
measures, whereas VCMs are based 
on internal targets and buyers 
can buy carbon credits based on 
voluntary commitments.

Carbon tax is comparatively easy to 
implement but it has limitations—for 
example, it has a higher impact on 
low-income households and no

216

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthEnergy Efficiency, from emitters 
and industry players such as 
exchanges, registries and 
verification bodies. Appointing a 
ministry or coordinating body that 
could design the ETS and ensure 
compliance (e.g., Directorate-
General for Climate Action in the EU 
or The Secretariat of Environment 
and Natural Resources in Mexico) 
could constitute the first step. This 
body could then make clear what 
the timelines for implementation 
are, what methodologies would 
need to be followed for obtaining 
and distributing allowances 
(Box 3), benchmarking and 
reporting, and what private sector 
capabilities would be needed 
(e.g., measurement, reporting and 
verification). It might also tender 
certain roles to the private sector 
(e.g., auctioning platform and 
exchange for trading allowances like 
the European Energy Exchange in 
the EU). This could ensure that the 
private sector and financiers would 
have the long-term visibility needed 
and begin to rise to the occasion.

 — Draw up a competitiveness 
impact assessment and 
mitigation plan: India could 
conduct a comprehensive sector-
level assessment of the impact 
such instruments may have on 
the competitiveness of Indian 
manufacturers and the potential for 
carbon leakage. Surfacing these 
issues in a fact-based manner and 
addressing them head on with 
mechanisms like carbon border 
adjustments could help obtain the 
buy-in of all stakeholders. Risk 
mitigation plans including levers 
such as free allowances for some 
sectors could also be put in place.

 — Build a private ecosystem 

including the measurement, 
reporting and verification (MRV) 
of carbon credits: Strong systems 
for reporting, verification and 
accounting of emissions are key to 

2b.  Compliance carbon markets 
(CCMs) for the longer-term

To build itself right, India needs to 
learn from the world and accelerate its 
compliance carbon markets through 
the proposed five steps:

 — Define an ambitious purpose: 
A blueprint which incentivises a 
systematic switch of investments 
into green assets such as hydrogen-
based green steel-making, rather 
than only incremental activities such 
as energy efficiency, would likely 
ensure that India builds the right 
industrial configuration. India could 
consider an ambitious plan which:

•  Covers at least 50 percent of 
emissions from high-emitting 
sectors by 2030.

•  Ramps up to a carbon price 
of $50 per ton by 2030 to 
enable investments into green 
technologies and prevent locking 
in further into long-lasting, 
carbon-intensive technologies.

•  Comes into effect quickly – India 
could target implementing ETS 
in 36 months. The EU’s ETS was 
the first large-scale compliance 
market, and it took time to rollout 
and achieve the desired results. 
However, based on its learnings, 
other markets have been able to 
ramp up faster. ETS in China was 
announced in the December of 
2017 and the trading was initiated 
in July 2021. Similarly, Mexico 
started ETS design work in 2017 
and began the ETS pilot which 
involved about 300 companies in 
2020.244

 — Outline clear guidelines, roles and 
responsibilities in the government 
to set up the market: Given that 
multiple stakeholders will be 
working in concert for the success 
of a CCM, the blueprint could clearly 
lay down the roles, responsibilities 
and expectations from ministries, 
nodal agencies such as Bureau of 

244   IISD – SDG knowledge hub; press search.
245   European Union climate action.
246   Centre for climate and energy solutions.

the success of a CCM. The private 
sector could efficiently provide MRV 
and other services such as advisory 
for a successful transition to a CCM.

 — Use CCM proceeds to ensure a 
just transition and for capacity 
building: There could be reskilling 
required for new green jobs which 
can be funded through the carbon 
revenues. This may also ensure 
that the policy is ‘self-funding’ and 
won’t require to be reallocated 
from elsewhere. For instance, in 
the EU – the Social Climate Fund 
has been proposed as part of the 
new Transport & Buildings ETS.245 
The revenue from auctioning of 
allowances would go to this fund, 
which would be used to finance 
temporary direct support to 
vulnerable households and make 
infrastructure investments that 
reduce emissions in these sectors. 
In California, ETS revenues go to the 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to 
design and implement programmes 
that facilitate greenhouse gas 
emission reductions and benefit 
disadvantaged communities 
and low-income households.246 
Overall, India’s national carbon 
plan could be balanced to 
include capability-building for 
industries, service providers, 
bankers and stakeholders to 
build an understanding about 
carbon markets. Learning how to 
decarbonise and trade will likely 
boost participation. 

Once India establishes its own market, 
it might also have an opportunity to 
take the expertise to other analogous 
countries (e.g., other high growth, 
emerging markets).

Case study on EU ETS 

The EU ETS was the first large-scale compliance market, and it delivered a positive result for the EU’s decarbonisation efforts. 
After implementing ETS, the EU has been able to achieve a reduction of 40 percent in total emissions from 2005 to 2020 and 
has set a new target of 55 percent emissions reduction by 2030.

The European ETS was launched in phases to ensure step by step implementation and to avoid the kind of pitfalls large-scale 
rollouts can be prone to. It took almost 15 years to enter the final phase.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthBox 3
Methods for obtaining and distributing allowances under ETS

ETS participants could obtain CO₂ 
allowances in three ways:

Auction: MoEF can declare the total 
number of allowances available for 
participants and organise tenders to 
distribute allowances from market 
prices set by tender bids,

Market trade: Participants can trade 
their allowances on an exchange 
platform run by the newly-created 
carbon exchange. Prices can be 
determined based on supply-demand 
principles.

Free allowance: MoEF can distribute 
free allowances to the industries 
exposed to carbon leakage risk 
to prevent them from losing their 
competitiveness in international 
markets.

Additionally, the methodology for 
allowance distribution could be 
based on:

Grandparenting: Free allowances are 
given to each facility based on historical 
emissions (e.g., an iron & steel plant 
may take 1 mCO₂ of allowance for free 
since it has emitted 1 mCO₂ in 2019).

Benchmarking: For each sector, the 
CO₂ emission factor unit is set (e.g., 
clinker factor-tCO₂/t clinker-for-
cement). Benchmark value is assigned 
to these factors and each facility takes 
free allowances based on its production 
level. Free allowances can be adjusted 
if production levels deviate from the

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growthbuilding a comprehensive net-zero 
roadmap (Exhibit 139).

Furthermore, a holistic sustainable 
finance strategy can help banks 
create long-term value by 
offsetting transition-related risks 
(such as potential market share 
loss or increased risk with newer 
technologies) and tapping into new 
opportunities for value creation 
(Exhibit 140).

4.  Proposed regulatory actions that 
could be considered to enable 
banks 

A well-coordinated set of 
interventions could be implemented 
by different regulatory bodies 
and government agencies across 
sectors to increase the availability 
of finance (Exhibit 141):

 — Resilience-building: 

Strengthening the sector’s 
resilience to sustainability-
related risks; this could be 
done through institutionalising 
scenario analysis and climate 

stress-testing within risk 
management; defining the 
governance frameworks for 
climate finance (e.g., risk 
appetite framework, board 
oversight, etc.).

 — Market solutions and 

development: Incentivising 
and facilitating the growth of 
sustainable investments, such 
as grants and direct investment, 
into sustainable projects.

 — Infrastructure enablers: 
Enabling efficiency and 
ensuring the integrity of the 
financial ecosystem—for 
instance, setting industry-wide 
green taxonomy and product-
development frameworks. 

 — Capability-building: 

Developing a knowledge and 
talent base in sustainable 
finance and risk assessment 
through educational 
programmes.

3.  Active and visible support lent 
by Indian financial institutions 
to the nation’s decarbonisation, 
consistent with the national plan

Globally, climate change impacts 
banks through various forces, 
with risk emerging from portfolio 
allocation, intensifying regulations, 
increasing investor activism and 
rising public expectations. The 
UN-convened Net-Zero Banking 
Alliance has brought together 
banks from around the world—
representing about 40 percent of 
global banking assets—that have 
committed to aligning their lending 
and investing portfolios with the 
2050 net-zero emissions target.247 

Indian banks could play a 
pivotal role in shaping India’s 
decarbonisation pathway, too. 
They would need to define net-zero 
ambition on their loan books and 
show commitment toward financed 
emissions and for facilitating the 
necessary transitions, defining 
sector-specific glidepaths and 

247   UN environment programme finance initiative.

 — Disclosure guidelines: 

Standardising disclosure 
guidelines to build transparency 
and a network of verification 
agencies to enable investors 
to evaluate opportunities. 
By mandating disclosure 
requirements, particularly 
in high-emitting sectors, 
companies could be awarded 
‘ESG’ ratings, which in turn could 
inform investors about where to 
channel funds and would act as 
a guardrail for financing. 

5.  Green banks248 could accelerate 
and enable financing of ‘hard-to-
abate’ use cases

Significant barriers exist to 
obtaining green project funds such 
as insufficient capacity in debt 
capital markets and perceived 

risks in policy frameworks or new 
technologies. Small projects also 
struggle to attract funding as 
the short-term expectations of 
investors often don’t meet long-
term financing requirements. This is 
where a green transition bank could 
come into play:

 — As an innovative transition 

structure to mobilise low-carbon 
investment and support local 
community development. 

 — To orchestrate government 
funds and support financing 
for early-stage projects before 
they become viable for other 
investors.

 — As a market maker to channel 
global green capital into local 
projects and as a catalyst for 
securitising green loans (rated 
and classified into tranches), 
which could create additional 
avenues for green-focused 
investors with different risk 
profiles. 

A green transition bank could help 
India unlock finance in its goal toward 
net-zero, as in other parts of the 
world—Australia, Japan and the United 
Kingdom have all created nationalised 
banks to leverage private investments 
in sustainable technologies. The UK 
Green Investment Bank, for example, 
was established in 2012 and, to date, 
has mobilised over £25 billion for 
36 GW of renewable energy projects.249 

248   A green transition bank is typically a public financial institution that uses innovative financing methods and market development tools with the private sector to 

accelerate decarbonisation.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth6. Ten bold actions

between 2030 and 2050. With a 
$50/t carbon price, India could 
avoid being locked into 200 Mt per 
annum of BF-BOF steel by 2050 
(high carbon asset) and replace it 
with hydrogen-based green steel 
which would create a carbon space 
of 20 MtCO₂e. While the European 
ETS took 15 years to set up, other 
countries have accelerated this and 
India could potentially do it in as few 
as three years.251

3.  Enabling banks to support the 
transition catalysed by a green 
transition bank. Banks could be 
asked to come up with their own 
investment glide paths within a 
year or two and build the necessary 
capability for assessing risks in 
these new spaces. The regulator 
could assist with the necessary 
taxonomy, disclosure guidelines, 
actions to reduce risks. A green 
transition bank with a clearly-
defined set of green financing 
norms could act as the catalyst for 
change.

All stakeholders would need 
to come together to launch 
institutional measures to accelerate 
financing in line with the national 
plan for net zero. Banks could 
define their net-zero ambition on 
their loan books, show commitment 
toward financed emissions, 
facilitate the necessary transitions, 
define sector-specific glidepaths 
and build a comprehensive net-zero 
roadmap. Institutional measures like 
shaping banking regulations toward 
transition financing and setting up a 
green transition bank to orchestrate 
capital could be considered to fast-
track decarbonisation.

In this backdrop, the ten actions to be 
considered today to accelerate India’s 
decarbonisation comprise:

1.  Laying out a detailed medium-

term (5 - 15 - 25-year) 
decarbonisation plan with 
sector-specific priorities and 
policy frameworks that provide the 
demand signals and a steady hand 
to allow corporates to invest. This 
would likely need an overarching 
governance mechanism through an 
accountable nodal agency to ensure 
coordination across ministries 
and external stakeholders in 
delivering net zero. It could include 
compensating mechanisms to 
address socioeconomic impact. 
Delays in doing this or quality gaps 
(e.g., inconsistent policies across 
sectors, too many changes) could 
lead to the wrong investment 
decisions worth several hundreds 
of billions of dollars, or reduced 
investment. The EU, for instance, 
has set up the post of the European 
Commissioner for Climate Action, 
which has been separated from 
the Environment Portfolio. The 
European Commission has put in 
place a series of proposals on how 
to achieve EU’s net zero targets 
by 2050250 so as to align business, 
government and civil society, 
set them on the same pathway, 
and provide policy stability for 
investments.

2.  Accelerating the implementation 
of a compliance carbon market 
(within three years) could also 
create demand signals to accelerate 
decarbonisation, especially in 
the hard-to-abate sectors and 
incentivise investments in newer 
technologies like CCUS. Policy 
makers could take a strategic (as 
opposed to a compliance-oriented) 
view of this, and work across 
ministries. Getting this right fast 
could enable both domestic and 
foreign investment. For instance, 
growing steel demand means rapid 
and continued capacity addition 

Ten urgent actions could be 
considered to accelerate India’s 
decarbonisation and ensure it is 
orderly.
From our analysis, it appears that 
benefits to India could outweigh the 
downsides of a well-planned, orderly, 
accelerated transition given India’s 
growth outlook. However, India must 
take action within this decade to set 
things up. If it does so, India must use its 
growth momentum and build India right 
in the decades thereafter.

It is vital for all stakeholders – 
government, corporates, consumers, 
civil society – to come together and 
act now and in concert to accelerate 
India’s decarbonisation and ensure 
it is orderly. The government could 
provide policy and regulatory support 
to make projects across sectors 
economically viable. These include but 
are not limited to incentivising usage of 
EVs and FCEVs by balancing taxation 
schemes, simplifying regulations for 
authorising and installing new power 
and grid installations, creating demand 
signals for higher-cost green materials 
like steel and generating support for 
localising electrolyser manufacturing. 
Support may also be required to 
ensure a just transition that minimises 
impact on low-income households. 
These actions could work together and 
happen in the right sequence in order to 
avoid shortages, price rise and the risk 
of a disorderly transition.

Achieving the necessary technological 
breakthroughs to reduce emissions 
in hard-to-abate sectors and 
accelerating their progress to market 
would likely require consistent public 
and private investment. It would also 
require greater willingness among 
business leaders and policy makers 
to adopt new technologies. These 
could include longer duration storage 
technologies to capture the seasonality 
of renewable sources, advancement in 
fuel cell technology and improvement in 
recycling technologies.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth4.  Accelerating renewable adoption 
in the power sector to scale up 
capacity addition four times, and 
to deepen market reforms with 
a 30-year outlook in a manner 
that ensures a stable grid fed 
predominantly by in firm power. 
Such reforms could include 
deepening power markets with 
the introduction of derivatives and 
futures for risk mitigation, launching 
ancillary services and capacity 
markets, leveraging demand-
side flexibility by speeding the 
adoption of consumer time-of-day 
tariffs and EV charging. It could 
also include creating supply-side 
flexibility by enabling existing coal 
and hydro plants to blend RE into 
existing PPAs and incentivising 
underutilised plants to participate 
in the capacity market. These 
market reforms could reduce 
the investment requirement by 
$150–200 billion by 2050. 

5.  Empowering a nodal authority to 
define a national land use plan, 
laying clear land-use guidelines 
and mandates for optimised use 
across urbanisation, industrial 
needs, carbon sinks, agriculture and 
renewables. It could make trade-
offs and enable efficient land use 
in consultation with states (‘land’ 
being a state subject). It would 
be essential to have a long-term 
outlook to balance the growing 
need for land across sectors. Finally, 
policies could ensure efficient land 
use across sectors (e.g., vertical 
urbanisation).

6.  Creating a resilient indigenous 
manufacturing capability 
and increasing investment in 
cleantech R&D. Effort would 
likely be needed to develop local 
raw material resources (e.g., 
rare earths), secure materials 
from elsewhere in the world and 
produce equipment (e.g., PV 
modules, battery) locally through 

mechanisms like the PLI. This could 
be supported by a green innovation 
mission in collaboration with private 
sector, academia, startups, etc. to 
accelerate investments, at-scale 
adoption and localisation of clean 
technologies. This can leverage 
India’s large technical and digital 
talent base to lead innovation and 
R&D in achieving low levelised 
costs of carbon capture in CCUS 
applications, high efficiency 
solar modules, low costs of green 
hydrogen, next generation energy 
storage, green metals, carbon 
credits tracking, etc.

7.  Evaluating five CCS hubs in 
Gujarat (Jamnagar), Odisha 
(Paradeep), Rajasthan (Barmer), 
Maharashtra (Pune) and 
Andhra Pradesh (Vizag) could 
be considered for public-private 
partnership for utilisation and 
storage of captured carbon. These 
hub locations are within 500 km of 
70 percent of India’s point-source 
emissions. The captured carbon can 
be transported through pipelines 
to existing oil fields for storage. 
Uptake would likely require funding 
support (e.g., grants) for exploration 
of carbon storage hubs and 
technology for capture, utilisation of 
carbon and development of pipeline 
infrastructure from point source of 
emissions to capture hubs. Various 
policy interventions like regulation-
imposed carbon prices (over $100/
tCO₂e) could push businesses to 
decarbonise. 

8.  Consider creating a national 

circularity mission with recycling 
hubs in the top 20 Indian cities 
(contributing 35 percent of MSW), 
mandating targets on recycling 
rates, recycled raw material use 
(e.g., blending norms) and landfill 
levies. For this to work, it would 
likely need the enforcement 
of existing and upcoming EPR 
regulations along with demand 

signals for recycled products (e.g., 
through carbon pricing on emission-
heavy, virgin raw-material). India 
can take inspiration from the 
circularity plans of the EU, Australia, 
China and the US.252 Links would 
be needed between sectors that 
can upcycle agricultural and crop 
waste (e.g., for use as packaging 
material, carbon-neutral biomass 
in industry) to reduce straw burning 
and crop-residue mismanagement. 
Strong supply networks could be 
set up to ensure easy collection, 
transportation and usage of 
residues. 

9.  Enhancing the National Hydrogen 
Mission. The low cost of renewable 
energy in India can help it become a 
leading exporter of green hydrogen 
embedded products in the short 
term, leveraging carbon regulations 
in energy-short markets. The 
government could play a key role 
in accelerating demand through 
blending mandates, boosting 
cost competitiveness via capital 
subsidies and R&D investments 
and enabling export opportunities 
via international trade agreements. 
It can create blending mandates 
across the fertiliser, refinery and 
steel sectors, which could kick-start 
the adoption of green hydrogen 
(and derivatives) as a replacement 
for grey hydrogen. Additionally, 
introducing carbon pricing through 
compliance carbon markets, in a 
calibrated but accelerated manner, 
could provide steel makers with 
the policy certainty to be able to 
invest. This could be accompanied 
with appropriate carbon border 
adjustment mechanisms to ensure 
the global competitiveness of 
India’s steel and manufacturing 
industry. Further, the introduction of 
PLIs to induce local manufacturing 
for electrolysers and balance of 
plants would be needed to reduce 
dependence on imports.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth10. Aiming to play on the front 

foot, companies could evaluate 
investment opportunities that 
this green trend would unlock, 
aligned with India’s national plans 
or the opportunities opened 
up by decarbonisation of other 
countries (e.g., green hydrogen 
derivative exports). To thrive 
further, companies could focus 
on creating strategic alignment, 
reallocating capital and people and 
engage with the government. As 
leaders prepare to discuss green 
transformation with their boards, it 
may help to quantify the potential. 
For companies that are not aligned 
with science-based carbon budgets 
and slow to reallocate capital 
for the green transition, the gap 
between management expectations 
and market valuation could grow. 
They would need to shift focus from 

prolonging the lead in traditional 
technologies to building competitive 
positions in zero emission 
technologies.

Government policies could 
create the demand signals for 
decarbonised products and 
services. The global financial sector 
and international customers (e.g., 
European customers impacted by 
ETS and carbon border adjustment 
mechanisms) could also demand 
decarbonisation roadmaps and 
committed action. Companies 
would need to respond. The 
government and corporate India 
may need to provide policy support 
and capability building for MSMEs 
to decarbonise faster (e.g., scoping 
three targets taken up by large 
firms could incentivise supplier 
ecosystems to decarbonise). 

These actions could be supported by 
consumers wholeheartedly such that 
we see a shift in consumer behaviour. 
The government has announced the 
Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) mission 
at CoP26. This would be a crucial 
component of India’s transition. 

To conclude, India could consider 
thoughtful action now, for setting 
itself up for an accelerated and orderly 
transition. Looking beyond the short-
term and laying the foundation for this 
transformation within this next decade 
would be the overarching imperative 
for the country as it sets forth on its 
decarbonising journey.

Decarbonising India: Charting a pathway for sustainable growth229

uptake rates were estimated based 
on products reaching the market and 
reasonable ramp-ups based on their 
technology development pace. The 
resulting pathway provides a lever-
by-lever outlook of how India could 
decarbonise

Cross-cutting themes such as CCUS, 
material circularity, NCS and Green 
hydrogen were modelled bottom-up 
based on inputs from the sector-wise 
models and integrated into the DSE. 
India’s NCS potential was estimated 
using McKinsey Nature Analytics’ 
proprietary geospatial modelling effort. 
India’s CCUS hubs were determined 
using point source emissions geospatial 
mapping while material circularity 
potential was calculated based on 
various waste streams’ utilisation 
potential across sectors.

To express volumes of different 
greenhouse gases using a common 
metric, we used metric of tons of 
CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e). Different 
greenhouse gases have different 
impacts on global warming. CO₂ can 
remain in the atmosphere for decades, 
while methane has a much stronger 
warming effect but a half-life of only 
12 years. It is not obvious how much 
methane abatement is equal to abating 
a gram of CO₂, since the average global 
warming potential of methane is much 
higher over a 20-year period than 
over a 100-year period. To translate 
methane and other GHG emissions 
to CO₂, therefore, requires setting a 
common timescale. We adopted the 
100-year global warming potential 
for all greenhouse gases to aid 
comparability.

Financing analysis 
methodology
The financing model looks at the full 
system Capex required for production 
as well as the Capex and Opex incurred 
in adopting decarbonisation levers. 
We defined cost outlooks for various 
commodities and technologies through 
the DSE based on inputs from the 
offline sector deep-dives as well as 
the DLL. For fossil fuels, we assumed 
prices would decline with falling oil 
demand. Power and hydrogen prices 
were dynamically modelled in the 
McKinsey Power Model and used 
as input for the demand sectors in 
the DSE. The capital cost reductions 
for some critical technologies such 
as batteries and electrolysers are 
based on the learning rate; the faster 
electrolysers are rolled out at scale, 
the faster they can decline in cost. Our 
cost outlooks for such technologies 
assumed that the rest of the world 
scales up their decarbonisation 
efforts, helping drive adoption and 
the associated downward pressure on 
costs.

The Marginal Abatement Cost Curve 
presented in this report is a cumulative 
abatement cost curve. To build this, we 
compared the total cost of ownership 
and level of abatement for each of the 
300 technology levers between our 
two main scenarios: the LoS and the 
Accelerated scenarios. To account 
for the varying levels of costs and 
abatement, we employed a weighted 
average across all years and to arrive 
at the total cumulative abatement, we 
added the total difference in abatement 
between the two scenarios. 

Modelling methodology
To shape our decarbonisation 
pathways, we used the Decarbonisation 
Scenario Explorer (DSE), McKinsey’s 
proprietary tool that helps to model 
scenarios built on underlying activity 
levels (e.g. vehicle PARC, tons of 
cement, steel, etc.) that drive the 
country’s emissions throughout the 
projected time horizon. The tool 
contains over 300 technologies and 
abatement levers across all sectors 
of the economy that allow us to build 
our tailored abatement scenarios. 
Five sectors – Power, Transport, 
Agriculture, Steel and Cement— were 
modelled bottom-up with granular 
offline teardowns of activity levels (by 
segment and technology), demand 
projections, emission factors and 
costs. Other sectors in the DSE, such 
as Buildings and Waste and Industrial 
sectors such as aluminium, ammonia, 
were modelled at a high-level using 
McKinsey’s existing Decarbonisation 
Lever Library (DLL). 

The modelled abatement pathways 
were not optimised for costs or 
co-optimised for GDP. However, each 
scenario assumes demand in line 
with projected sectoral growth rates 
as well as GDP. For example, while 
demand increases rapidly in industrial 
sectors, mechanisation and improved 
productivity drive slower growth in 
primary sectors such as agriculture. 

The DSE also defines various 
technologies and fuel types for each 
segment – differing uptake levers 
in line with sectoral growths are 
input in the DSE for the lever library 
technologies and fuel types for each 
sector and segment. These range from 
conventional technologies, such as 
ICE long-haul trucks and coal blast 
furnaces for industrial heating, to 
technologies still under development, 
such as hydrogen trucks and electric 
furnaces. For new technologies,
