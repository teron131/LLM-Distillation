McKinsey Global Institute

Since its founding in 1990, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has sought to develop a deeper 
understanding of the evolving global economy. As the business and economics research arm of 
McKinsey & Company, MGI aims to help leaders in the commercial, public, and social sectors understand 
trends and forces shaping the global economy.

MGI research combines the disciplines of economics and management, employing the analytical tools 
of economics with the insights of business leaders. Our “micro-to-macro” methodology examines 
microeconomic industry trends to better understand the broad macroeconomic forces affecting 
business strategy and public policy. Recent reports have assessed the impact of the COVID-19 crisis 
on the future of work, productivity and growth, and consumer demand; prioritizing health; the social 
contract; Black economic mobility; the global balance sheet; the Bio Revolution; physical climate risk; 
and the impact of corporations on economies and households.

MGI is led by McKinsey & Company senior partners James Manyika and Sven Smit, who serve as 
co-chairs, and Chris Bradley, Kweilin Ellingrud, Marco Piccitto, Olivia White, and Jonathan Woetzel, 
who serve as directors. Michael Chui, Mekala Krishnan, Anu Madgavkar, Jan Mischke, Jaana Remes, 
Jeongmin Seong, and Tilman Tacke are MGI partners. Project teams are led by the MGI partners and 
include consultants from McKinsey offices around the world. These teams draw on McKinsey’s global 
network of partners and industry and management experts. The MGI Council is made up of McKinsey 
leaders and includes Hemant Ahlawat, Michael Birshan, Andrés Cadena, Sandrine Devillard, André Dua, 
Katy George, Rajat Gupta, Eric Hazan, Solveigh Hieronimus, Acha Leke, Clarisse Magnin, Jurica Novak, 
Gary Pinkus, Hamid Samandari, Sha Sha, Oliver Tonby, and Eckart Windhagen. The Council members 
help shape the research agenda, lead high-impact research, and share the findings with decision makers 
around the world. In addition, leading economists, including Nobel laureates, advise MGI research. 

In collaboration with McKinsey Sustainability and the Global 
Energy & Materials and Advanced Industries practices 

McKinsey Sustainability is the firm’s client-service platform with the goal of helping all industry 
sectors transform to get to net zero by 2050 and to cut carbon emissions by half by 2030. 
McKinsey Sustainability seeks to be the preeminent impact partner and adviser for our clients, 
from the board room to the engine room, on sustainability, climate resilience, energy transition, 
and environmental, social, and governance (ESG). We leverage thought leadership, innovative 
tools and solutions, top experts, and a vibrant ecosystem of industry associations and knowledge 
partnerships to lead a wave of innovation and economic growth that safeguards our planet and

McKinsey’s Global Energy & Materials Practice serves clients in industries such as oil and gas, mining, 
steel, pulp and paper, cement, chemicals, agriculture, and power, helping them on their most important 
issues in strategy, operations, marketing and sales, organization, and other functional topics. In addition, 
MineLens, MineSpans, and Energy Insights, specialist divisions within the practice, offer fundamental 
insight into commodity market dynamics. The practice serves many of the top global players, including 
corporations and state-owned enterprises, and works with more than 80 percent of the largest mining 
companies and 90 percent of the largest oil and gas companies worldwide.

McKinsey’s Advanced Industries Practice brings together three well-established global industry 
practices with roots in technically complex design and manufacturing: Automotive & Assembly, 
Aerospace & Defense, and Advanced Electronics / Semiconductors. Our global network of deeply 
experienced industrials partners works with industry executives to address issues including strategy, 
organization, operations, technology, marketing, sales, and risk. We focus on core operating capabilities 
and help clients take a long-term, through-cycle view of the evolving competitive landscape. We work 
with many high-performing iconic industrial companies around functional, business unit, and enterprise 
transformations to accelerate revenue generation, technology integration, operations design, and 
margin and cash flow improvements.

Preface

More than 10,000 years of continuous and accelerating progress have brought human 
civilization to the point of threatening the very condition that made that progress possible: 
the stability of the earth’s climate. The physical manifestations of a changing climate are 
increasingly visible across the globe, as are their socioeconomic impacts. Both will continue 
to grow, most likely in a nonlinear way, until the world transitions to a net-zero economy, and 
unless it adapts to a changing climate in the meantime. No wonder, then, that an ever-greater 
number of governments and companies are committing to accelerate climate action.

At present, though, the net-zero equation remains unsolved: greenhouse gas emissions 
continue unabated and are not counterbalanced by removals, nor is the world prepared 
to complete the net-zero transition. Indeed, even if all net-zero commitments and national 
climate pledges were fulfilled, research suggests that warming would not be held to 1.5°C 
above preindustrial levels, increasing the odds of initiating the most catastrophic impacts 
of climate change, including the risk of biotic feedback loops. Moreover, most of these 
commitments have yet to be backed by detailed plans or executed. Nor would execution be 
easy: solving the net-zero equation cannot be divorced from pursuing economic development 
and inclusive growth. It would require a careful balancing of the shorter-term risks of poorly 
prepared or uncoordinated action with the longer-term risks of insufficient or delayed action. 
Indeed, a more disorderly transition could impair energy supply and affect energy access and 
affordability, especially for lower-income households and regions. It could also have knock-on 
impacts on the economy more broadly, potentially creating a backlash that would slow down 
the transition.

None of these challenges should come as a surprise. Achieving net zero would mean a 
fundamental transformation of the world economy, as it would require significant changes to 
the seven energy and land-use systems that produce the world’s emissions: power, industry, 
mobility, buildings, agriculture, forestry and other land use, and waste. To bring about these 
changes, nine key requirements (encompassing physical building blocks, economic and 
societal adjustments, and governance, institutions, and commitment) would need to be 
fulfilled against the backdrop of many economic and political challenges. 

This means addressing dozens of complex questions, including: what is the appropriate mix 
of technologies that need to be deployed to achieve emissions reductions while staying 
within a carbon budget, limiting costs, and delivering required standards of performance? 
Where are supply chain and infrastructure bottlenecks most likely to occur? Where might 
physical constraints, whether related to the availability of natural resources or the scale-up 
of production capacity, limit the pace of the transition? What levels of spending on physical 
assets would the transition require? Who would pay for the transition? How would the 
transition affect companies’ markets and operations? What would it spell for workers and 
consumers? What opportunities and risks would it create for companies and countries? 
And how could consumers be encouraged to make changes to consumption and spending 
habits that will be necessary to ensure the transition?

In this report, we attempt to answer some of these questions, namely, those pertaining to 
the economic and societal adjustments. We provide estimates of the economic changes that 
would take place in a net-zero transition consistent with 1.5°C of warming. We seek to build 
and expand upon the vast external literature on the net-zero transition, in order to offer a more 
detailed and granular view of the nature and magnitude of the economic changes that it would 
entail. As a result, our estimates of the annual spending on physical assets for a net-zero 
transition exceed to a meaningful degree the $3 trillion–$4.5 trillion total spending estimates 
that previous analyses have produced.

McKinsey & CompanyThis report is a first-order analysis of a hypothetical 1.5°C scenario. As such, it has 
several limitations.

First, it is not clear whether a 1.5°C scenario is achievable in the first place, nor what pathway 
the world would take to achieve it if it were. Indeed, some believe that 1.5°C is already out 
of reach, given the current trajectory of emissions and their potential to activate climatic 
feedback loops, as well as prevailing challenges with revamping energy and land-use 
systems. This research does not take a position on such questions. Instead, it seeks to 
demonstrate the economic shifts that would need to take place if the goal of 1.5 degrees is to 
be attained through a relatively orderly transition between now and 2050.

Second, this report is by nature and necessity limited in its scope. In particular it does not 
focus on such issues as technology breakthroughs, physical constraints related to scale-
up capacity and the availability of natural resources, delayed-transition costs, the role of 
adaptation, or other imponderables or uncertainties, nor have we yet modeled the full range 
of economic outcomes likely under a net-zero transition. As a result, it is likely that real 
outcomes will diverge from these estimates, particularly if the net-zero transition takes a more 
disorderly path or restricting warming to 1.5°C proves unachievable. Spending requirements 
could be higher, for example due to the additional investment needed to maintain flexibility 
and redundancy in energy systems, or heightened physical risks and commensurate 
adaptation costs. 

Third, this report does not explore the critical question of who pays for the transition. What is 
clear is that the transition will require collective and global action, particularly as the burdens 
of the transition would not be evenly felt. The prevailing notion of enlightened self-interest 
alone is unlikely to be sufficient to help achieve net zero, and the transition would challenge 
traditional orthodoxies and require unity, resolve, and ingenuity from leaders.

We nonetheless hope that our scenario-based analysis will help decision makers refine 
their understanding of the nature and the magnitude of the changes the net-zero transition 
would entail and the scale of response needed to manage it. We also hope that our attempts 
to describe as accurately as we can the challenges that lie ahead are seen as what they are: 
a call for more thoughtful and more decisive action, urgency, and resolve.

The report is joint research by McKinsey Sustainability, McKinsey’s Global Energy and 
Materials Practice, McKinsey’s Advanced Industries Practice, and the McKinsey Global 
Institute. McKinsey has long focused on issues of environmental sustainability, dating to client 
studies in the early 1970s. We developed our global greenhouse gas abatement cost curve in 
2007, updated it in 2009, and have since conducted national abatement studies in countries 
including Brazil, China, Germany, India, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States. Recent research on which we build in this publication includes the January 2020 
report Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts, a January 
2021 article, “Climate math: What it takes to limit warming to 1.5°C,” and two October 2021 
articles, “Our future lives and livelihoods: Sustainable and inclusive and growing” and 
“Solving the net-zero equation: Nine requirements for a more orderly transition.”

In brief 

The net-zero transition: What it would cost,  
what it could bring 

Governments and companies are increasingly committing to climate action. Yet significant challenges stand in the way, not 
least the scale of economic transformation that a net-zero transition would entail and the difficulty of balancing the substantial 
short-term risks of poorly prepared or uncoordinated action with the longer-term risks of insufficient or delayed action. In this 
report, we estimate the transition’s economic effects on demand, capital allocation, costs, and jobs to 2050 globally across 
energy and land-use systems that produce about 85 percent of overall emissions and assess economic shifts for 69 countries. 
Our analysis is not a projection or a prediction and does not claim to be exhaustive; it is the simulation of one hypothetical, 
relatively orderly path toward 1.5°C using the Net Zero 2050 scenario from the Network for Greening the Financial System 
(NGFS), to provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the economic transformation and societal adjustments associated 
with net-zero transition. We find that the transition would be universal, significant, and front-loaded, with uneven effects on 
sectors, geographies, and communities, even as it creates growth opportunities:

Capital spending on physical assets for energy and land-use systems in the net-zero transition between 2021 and 2050 
would amount to about $275 trillion, or $9.2 trillion per year on average, an annual increase of as much as $3.5 trillion 
from today. To put this increase in comparative terms, the $3.5 trillion is approximately equivalent, in 2020, to half of global 
corporate profits, one-quarter of total tax revenue, and 7 percent of household spending. An additional $1 trillion of today’s 
annual spend would, moreover, need to be reallocated from high-emissions to low-emissions assets. Accounting for expected 
increases in spending, as incomes and populations grow, as well as for currently legislated transition policies, the required 
increase in spending would be lower, but still about $1 trillion. The spending would be front-loaded, rising from 6.8 percent of 
GDP today to as much as 8.8 percent of GDP between 2026 and 2030 before falling. While these spending requirements are 
large and financing has yet to be established, many investments have positive return profiles (even independent of their role in 
avoiding rising physical risks) and should not be seen as merely costs. Technological innovation could reduce capital costs for 
net-zero technologies faster than expected.

In this scenario, the global average delivered cost of electricity would increase in the near term but then fall back 
from that peak, although this would vary across regions. As the power sector builds renewables and transmission and 
distribution capacity, the fully loaded unit cost of electricity production, accounting for operating costs, capital costs, and 
depreciation of new and existing assets, in this scenario could rise about 25 percent from 2020 until 2040 and still be about 
20 percent higher in 2050 on average globally. Cost increases in the near term could be significantly higher than those 
estimated here, for example, if grid intermittency issues are not well managed. The delivered cost could also fall below 2020 
levels over time because of the lower operating cost of renewables—provided that power producers build flexible, reliable, and 
low-cost grids. 

The transition could result in a gain of about 200 million and a loss of about 185 million direct and indirect jobs globally 
by 2050. This includes demand for jobs in operations and in construction of physical assets. Demand for jobs in the fossil fuel 
extraction and production and fossil-based power sectors could be reduced by about nine million and four million direct jobs, 
respectively, as a result of the transition, while demand for about eight million direct jobs would be created in renewable power, 
hydrogen, and biofuels by 2050. While important, the scale of workforce reallocation may be smaller than that from other 
trends including automation. Displaced workers will nonetheless need support, training, and reskilling through the transition.

While the transition would create opportunities, sectors with high-emissions products or operations—which generate 
about 20 percent of global GDP—would face substantial effects on demand, production costs, and employment. In the 
NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, coal production for energy use would nearly end by 2050, and oil and gas production volumes 
would be about 55 percent and 70 percent lower, respectively, than today. Process changes would increase production costs 
in other sectors, with steel and cement facing increases by 2050 of about 30 and 45 percent, respectively, in the scenario 
modeled here. Conversely, some markets for low-carbon products and support services would expand. For example, demand 
for electricity in 2050 could more than double from today. 

Poorer countries and those reliant on fossil fuels are most exposed to the shifts in a net-zero transition, although 
they have growth prospects as well. These countries are more susceptible to changes in output, capital stock, and 
employment because exposed sectors make up relatively large parts of their economies. Exposed geographies including in 
sub-Saharan Africa and India would need to invest 1.5 times or more than advanced economies as a share of GDP today to 

viii

McKinsey & Companysupport economic development and build low-carbon infrastructure. The effects within developed economies could be 
uneven, too; for instance, more than 10 percent of jobs in 44 US counties are in fossil fuel extraction and refining, fossil fuel–
based power, and automotive manufacturing. At the same time, all countries will have growth prospects, from endowments 
of natural capital such as sunshine and forests, and through their technological and human resources.

Consumers may face additional up-front capital costs and have to spend more in the near term on electricity if 
cost increases are passed through, and lower-income households everywhere are naturally more at risk. Consumer 
spending habits may also be affected by decarbonization efforts, including the need to replace goods that burn fossil fuel, 
like transportation vehicles and home heating systems, and potentially modify diets to reduce high-emissions products 
like beef and lamb. The up-front capital spending for the net-zero transition could yield lower operating costs over time for 
consumers. For example, total cost of ownership for EVs is expected to be lower than ICE cars in most regions by 2025.

Economic shifts could be substantially higher under a disorderly transition, in particular because of higher-order 
effects not considered here. The economic and social costs of a delayed or abrupt transition would raise the risk of asset 
stranding, worker dislocations, and a backlash that delays the transition. Even under a relatively gradual transition, if the ramp-
down of high-emissions activities is not carefully managed in parallel with the ramp-up of low-emissions ones, supply may not 
be able to scale up sufficiently, making shortages and price increases or volatility a feature. Much therefore depends on how 
the transition is managed.

For all the accompanying costs and risks, the economic adjustments needed to reach net zero would come with 
opportunities and prevent further buildup of physical risks. Incremental capital spending on physical assets creates 
growth opportunities, in connection with new low-emissions products, support services, and their supply chains. Most 
importantly, reaching net-zero emissions and limiting warming to 1.5°C would reduce the odds of initiating the most 
catastrophic impacts of climate change, including limiting the risk of biotic feedback loops and preserving our ability to halt 
additional warming. 

Government and business would need to act together with singular unity, resolve, and ingenuity, and extend their 
planning and investment horizons even as they take immediate actions to manage risks and capture opportunities. 
Businesses would need to define, execute, and evolve decarbonization and offsetting plans for scope 1 and 2 emissions 
and potentially expand those plans to include scope 3 emissions, depending on the nature of their operations, and the 
materiality, feasibility, and need of doing so. Over time, they would need to adjust their business models as conditions change 
and opportunities arise; integrate climate-related factors into decision-making processes for strategy, finance, and capital 
planning, among others; and consider leading action with others in their industry or ecosystem of investors, supply chains, 
customers, and regulators. Financial institutions in particular have a pivotal role to play in supporting large-scale capital 
reallocation, even as they manage their own risks and opportunities. Governments and multilateral institutions could use 
existing and new policy, regulatory, and fiscal tools to establish incentives, support vulnerable stakeholders, and foster 
collective action. The pace and scale of the transition mean that many of today’s institutions would need to be revamped and 
new ones created to disseminate best practices, establish standards and tracking mechanisms, drive capital deployment at 
scale, manage uneven impacts, and support further coordination of efforts. 

The goal of this research is to provide stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of the nature and magnitude of the 
economic and societal adjustments a net zero transition would entail. Our hope is that this analysis provides leaders with 
the tools to collectively secure a more orderly transition to net-zero by 2050. The findings serve as a clear call for more 
thoughtful and decisive action, taken with the utmost urgency. The rewards of the net-zero transition would far exceed the 
mere avoidance of the substantial, and possibly catastrophic, dislocations that would result from unabated climate change, 
or the considerable benefits they entail in natural capital conservation. Besides the immediate economic opportunities they 
create, they open up clear possibilities to solve global challenges in both physical and governance-related terms. These 
include the potential for a long-term decline in energy costs that would help solve many other resource issues and lead to a 
palpably more prosperous global economy. More importantly, they presage decisive solutions to age-old global economic 
and political challenges as the result of the unprecedented pace and scale of global collaboration that such a transition would 
have required. And while the immediate tasks ahead may seem daunting, human ingenuity can ultimately solve the net-zero 
equation, just as it has solved other seemingly intractable problems over the past 10,000 years. The key issue is whether 
the world can muster the requisite boldness and resolve to broaden its response during the upcoming decade that will in all 
likelihood decide the nature of the transition.

Executive summary 

As of this writing, in December 2021, more than 70 countries accounting for more than 
80 percent of global CO₂ emissions and about 90 percent of global GDP have put net-zero 
commitments in place, as have more than 5,000 companies, as part of the United Nations’ 
Race to Zero campaign.1 Yet even if all the existing commitments and national climate pledges 
were fulfilled, estimates suggest that warming would exceed 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, 
increasing the odds of initiating the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, including 
biotic feedback loops.2 Moreover, most of these commitments have yet to be supported by 
detailed plans or executed. Nor will execution be trivial, as it would require a careful balancing 
of shorter- and longer-term risks.

Today, while the imperative to reach net-zero is increasingly recognized, the net-zero equation 
is not solved. This state of affairs should not be surprising, given the scale of the task at 
hand. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would entail a fundamental transformation of 
the global economy. To bring about these changes, nine key requirements encompassing 
the three categories of physical building blocks, economic and societal adjustments, and 
governance, institutions, and commitment would need to be fulfilled against the backdrop 
of many economic (for example, inflation) and political challenges (for example, polarization 
within and among countries).3 

In this report, we focus on the second category, namely, understanding the nature and extent 
of the economic and societal adjustments. We simulate the global shifts in demand, capital 
allocation, costs, and jobs that would take place between now and 2050 in the context of a 
net-zero transition, examining potential gains and opportunities as well as losses and costs. 
Our analysis covers the energy and land-use systems that produce about 85 percent of 
overall emissions and takes a closer look at how the transition might affect 69 countries. 

This analysis is not a projection or a prediction; it provides point estimates of specific 
economic transformations likely under a given hypothetical net-zero transition scenario 
from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an organization set up by central 
banks and supervisors in December 2017 with the goal of strengthening the global response 
to climate change. (We describe our methodology and its limitations in Box E1, “Our research 
methodology: Approach, scenarios, limitations, and uncertainties.”) This scenario has an 
even chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C; however, it is not clear whether the world will be 
able to keep the temperature increase to that level, or which of numerous pathways it may 
take in an effort to do so. This research does not take a position on such questions. Instead, 
it seeks to demonstrate the economic shifts that would need to take place if the goal of 
1.5 degrees is to be attainable and a relatively orderly transition achieved.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringBox E1 

Our research methodology: Approach, scenarios, limitations, and uncertainties 

We assess the net-zero transition along two dimensions: sectors and geographies. For the first, we examine energy and land-
use systems that account for about 85 percent of global emissions: power, industry (steel and cement production), mobility 
(in particular, road transportation), buildings, agriculture and food, and forestry and other land use. We also looked at fossil 
fuels that supply energy to many of these systems. For the geographic dimension, we analyze effects in depth in 69 countries, 
which make up about 95 percent of global GDP. 

We chose not to develop our own transition scenarios and rely instead on widely used scenarios created by other institutions. 
Specifically, we analyze potential effects under the Net Zero 2050 scenario defined by the Network for Greening the Financial 
System (NGFS). This hypothetical scenario mirrors global aspirations to cut emissions by about half by 2030 and to net zero 
by 2050 (Exhibit E1). It reaches net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050 for the economy as a whole; this means there are some 
low residual gross CO₂ emissions in hard-to-abate sectors and some regions that are counterbalanced by CO₂ removals. 
We chose to work with the NGFS scenarios because they cover all major energy and land-use systems in a coherent manner, 
provide regional granularity, are designed for use in risk and opportunity analysis, and are becoming the standard scenarios 
used by financial institutions, regulators, and supervisors.1

In some cases, as a counterfactual for comparison, we also use the NGFS Current Policies scenario. This scenario projects the 
greenhouse gas emissions that would occur if only today’s mitigation policies remain in place (based on an NGFS assessment 
of policies as of the start of 2020), and it anticipates a little over 3°C of warming by 2100.2 The comparison allows us to account 
for how other factors such as GDP growth or population growth could affect the economy between now and 2050. We also 
collaborated with Vivid Economics to use the two NGFS scenarios to generate more granular sector variables where needed 
(for example, sales of new automobiles), in a manner that was based on and compliant with the NGFS scenarios. In such cases, 
we still refer to the specific sector variable as being based on the relevant NGFS scenario.

We performed the analysis as follows. First, we used the NGFS scenarios and downscaling by Vivid Economics to quantify 
changes in important variables in each energy and land-use system (for example, changes in power production by source). 
The downscaling was done to provide sectoral or technological granularity where not available from NGFS. We used this to 
assess changes in demand, and then assessed the implications for capital stock and investment, producer and consumer 
costs, and employment based on information about decarbonization technologies and their capital and operating costs, 
labor intensity, and effects on value chains. Where possible, we used region-specific costs and labor assumptions, as well as 
expected technology learning curves over time, based on McKinsey analysis. 

Limitations of our approach and uncertainties. We recognize the limitations of the NGFS scenarios, as with any transition 
scenario, given that this is an emerging field of research. First, while some variables are explored at the sector level, the 
scenarios sometimes do not provide enough detail to explore how different types of activities will be affected, thus requiring 
downscaling to achieve the necessary sectoral granularity. Second, the models underpinning the NGFS scenarios may not 
capture important dynamics or constraints within a sector. For example, the model we used favors more economy-wide use of 
biomass in energy and industry (for example, hydrogen production) than may be considered feasible in other sector-specific 
decarbonization pathways. Third, although the models do capture ongoing learning and technological innovation, they may fail 
to sufficiently anticipate the emergence of disruptive technologies that may change decarbonization pathways and lower cost 
trajectories faster than anticipated. Fourth, while some NGFS scenarios have begun to incorporate damages from physical 
risks in the economic modeling, further work is needed to fully integrate physical risks into the decarbonization pathways. 
As a result, we have focused here on scenarios that do not incorporate physical risk. This approach also allows us to focus our 
analysis on the effects of the transition alone.3 Finally, the scenarios reflect climate policies and technological trends in place 
before the COVID- 19 pandemic and climate negotiations and pledges at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021.

Our analysis largely consists of an analysis of first-order effects. Various uncertainties could influence the magnitude of 
outcomes highlighted here. While some of these factors could result in lower outcomes than those sized in this research, some 
factors suggest that additional costs and effects will likely occur as the transition unfolds. By the same token, the costs of 
physical climate risks could likely prove higher than those described here. 

1  NGFS says this scenario “limits global warming to 1.5°C through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net-zero CO₂ emissions around 2050, giving at 

least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5 °C by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot (< 0.1 °C) of 1.5 °C in earlier years.” We use the 
REMIND-MAgPIE scenario from NGFS (2021 release), which allows a CO₂ budget of about 440 gigatons (Gt) after 2020.

McKinsey & CompanyBox E1 (continued)

Key uncertainties include the following:

 — Warming scenario and emissions pathway. A higher warming scenario (for example, 2.0°C above preindustrial levels) 

may lead to smaller transition effects than a 1.5°C warming scenario, given the lower degree of emissions reduction and 
deviation from today’s production and consumption patterns it entails (though physical risks would naturally be higher). 

 — Sectors’ decarbonization actions and activity levels. Because the focus of our work is assessing the nature and 

magnitude of economic shifts and not identifying decarbonization actions, we used a prespecified net-zero scenario from 
NGFS. It is feasible that an alternate technology mix could result in lower costs and different shifts than those described 
here, and that further technological innovation could result in a different pathway with lower costs. It is also feasible that 
the path the world undertakes to decarbonize is different from the one described here. An alternate scenario may consist 
of more use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies and a focus on decarbonizing the hydrocarbon value chain, 
for example, this could happen if capture costs fall, regulatory frameworks are put in place to incentivize CCS use, and 
markets mature for recycled CO₂ as a material feedstock.4 

 — Magnitude of direct and indirect socioeconomic effects. Some effects could be larger than described here, for example, 
if executing the transition is more complex than the scenario here suggests, and additional capital spending is needed 
to maintain flexibility and redundancy in energy systems. If supply of key materials or low-emissions sources of energy 
does not keep up with demand, this could result in shortages and price increases, which we have not considered in our 
quantification. Higher-order effects could magnify risks and increase costs, particularly in the short term. For example, 
depending on how the transition is financed, the effects on the overall economy could be substantially higher than sized 
here. Finally, effects could also be larger under an abrupt or delayed transition.

 — Economic and societal adjustments needed for the transition. Costs and investments could be higher than sized here, 
for example to implement social support schemes to aid economic and societal adjustments. Similarly, additional costs 
may arise from delays, setbacks, and urgently needed adaptation measures, particularly if restricting warming to 1.5°C 
proves not to be possible. For our analysis, we quantify the scale of first-order effects and describe qualitatively the 
adjustments needed.

Aspects we did not cover. Topics we did not cover include the likelihood, validity, and comparative costs associated with 
various decarbonization scenarios; the comparative merits of different emissions-reduction technologies; constraints to 
implement and deploy decarbonization technologies (for example, scaling up supply chains); the actions needed to drive and 
incentivize decarbonization; quantification of higher-order economic effects of the transition, including on output, growth, 
value pools, valuations, trade flows, and human well-being; relative costs and merits of decarbonization and adaptation; and 
impacts that could result from physical climate hazards. We use benchmarks from the external literature and our past research 
to describe these latter possibilities. As discussed above, our analysis here represents first-order estimates. Fully quantifying 
the costs of rising physical risks and the transition is complex. It would require estimating impacts from rising physical risks 
and the cost of adaptation actions, building robust estimates of the impact of the net-zero transition on the economy that 
takes into account the higher-order effects described above, and doing so over time and while grappling with the various 
uncertainties described previously.

Full details of our methodology are in the technical appendix.

McKinsey & CompanyOutcomes may well exceed our estimates here, particularly if the net-zero transition takes a 
disorderly path or if it proves impossible to restrict warming to 1.5°C (see Box E2, “Who will pay 
for the transition?”). We nonetheless hope such an exercise will help decision makers refine 
their understanding of the nature and the magnitude of the changes the net-zero transition 
would entail, and the scale of response needed to manage it.

Six characteristics of the net-zero transition emerge from our scenario-based analysis. 
First, the transition would be universal. Indeed, net-zero emissions can be achieved if and only 
if all energy and land-use systems that contribute to emissions are decarbonized, as these 
contributions are significant in all cases. All economic sectors and all countries would need 
to participate. 

Second, the scale of the required economic transformation would be significant. In particular, 
we estimate that the cumulative capital spending on physical assets for the net-zero transition 
between 2021 and 2050 would be about $275 trillion. This means that spending would need 
to rise from about $5.7 trillion today to an annual average of $9.2 trillion through 2050, an 
increase of $3.5 trillion. Accounting for expected increases in spending, as incomes and 
populations grow, as well as for currently legislated transition policies, the required increase 
in spending would be lower, but still about $1 trillion. 

Third, these effects would be front-loaded: spending would need to rise to almost 9 percent 
of GDP between 2026 and 2030 from about 7 percent today before falling. Likewise, we 
estimate that the delivered cost of electricity (across generation, transmission, distribution, 
and storage, and including operating costs, capital costs, and depreciation of existing and 
new assets) would rise by about 25 percent between 2020 and 2040 in the scenario modeled 
here before falling from that peak, although this would vary across regions. 

Fourth, the transition would be felt unevenly among sectors, geographies, and communities, 
resulting in greater challenges for some constituencies than others. 

Fifth, the transition is laden with short-term risks, even as the transition will help manage 
long-term physical risks. If poorly managed, it could increase energy prices, with implications 
for energy access and affordability, especially for lower-income households and regions. 
It would also have knock-on effects on the economy more broadly. If not well managed, 
there is a risk that the transition itself would be derailed. 

Sixth is that, despite the challenges with making economic and societal adjustments, the 
transition would give rise to growth opportunities across sectors and geographies—and, 
critically, it would help avoid the buildup of physical risks. 

This research aims to highlight the nature and magnitude of the economic transformation that 
a net-zero transition would require. While the challenges ahead are large, the findings of this 
research should be seen for what they are: a call for more thoughtful, decisive, and urgent 
action to secure a more orderly transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. Everyone would 
have a role to play, including governments, businesses, and individuals. To ease stakeholders’ 
adjustments to these effects, governments and businesses will likely need to adopt a long-
term perspective and coordinate action in a spirit of unity, resolve, and cooperation and, at the 
same time, take near-term actions to manage their own risks and capture opportunities. 

This research is a call for 
more thoughtful, decisive, 
and urgent action.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring 
Box E2 

Who will pay for the transition? 

As discussed later in this report, the spending needed on physical assets for the net-
zero transition is significant. It represents a substantial scale-up of spending relative 
to today’s levels. It is also capital that will be spent very differently relative to today, 
with capital reallocated away from high-emissions assets and toward low-emissions 
ones. While some of this spending would eventually yield a return, various challenges 
with raising capital at this scale will need to be effectively managed. These include 
addressing technological uncertainty of investment, managing risk/return trade-offs, 
driving capital flows to developing countries, and ensuring demand for this capital exists 
in the sectors and geographies in which emissions reduction is most needed.

This raises the question of how to best pay for the transition. Various aspects to 
consider include who provides the financing (for example, public versus private actors, 
and the mix of financing provided by developed and developing countries), how capital is 
raised (for example, debt versus equity, through taxes on companies or consumers), and 
various combinations thereof. For example, public financing can come through raising 
taxes on companies, carbon taxes, taxes on consumers, or through taking on debt, to 
name a few approaches.

In deciding the optimal approach to financing the transition, stakeholders will need to 
consider three factors. First, which approach would raise capital at the speed and scale 
needed, and incentivize the deployment of this capital. Second, how financing can best 
include principles of equity, including what equity would require based on the history 
of emissions and who has the ability to pay. And finally, what are broader knock-on 
consequences of different financing approaches. 

The latter is especially important, because it can profoundly influence the 
socioeconomic consequences of a net-zero transition. First, some ways of raising 
capital—for example, taxes on consumers—could curtail spending in other parts of the 
economy if not balanced, for example, with fiscal stimulus elsewhere. This in turn could 
have knock-on effects on corporate revenues for affected sectors, on job creation, and 
on growth more broadly. Second, the source of financing could exacerbate existing 
inequalities if not carefully managed. Developing countries, for example, may find it 
challenging to raise the capital needed for the transition on their own. Third, the type 
of financing could have a role in influencing the pace of the net-zero transition. Certain 
technologies, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, may require public 
financing at scale to reach the speed of deployment needed to achieve net-zero. 

The results presented here do not factor in these considerations, as our focus is on 
sizing the magnitude of the need. However, the question of “who pays” is unavoidable 
as stakeholders undertake the economic transformation needed for the net-zero 
transition, and do so with the consequences mentioned above in mind.

McKinsey & CompanyNet-zero emissions can be 
achieved only through a 
universal transformation of 
energy and land-use systems 

To stabilize the climate and limit physical climate risks, climate science tells us that it is 
necessary to reduce the addition of GHGs to the atmosphere to net zero (see Box E3, 
“Physical risks will continue to build up until net zero is achieved”). Seven energy and land-use 
systems act as direct sources of global emissions (Exhibits E2 and E3).4 One system—forestry 
and other land use—also acts as a natural sink for carbon dioxide and would need to increase 
its rate of emissions absorption. The systems and their emissions footprints are the following: 

 — Power, consisting of electricity and heat generation: 30 percent of CO₂ emissions, and 

3 percent of nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions5  

 — Industry, consisting of various industrial processes, including production of steel, cement, 

and chemicals, and extraction and refining of oil, gas, and coal: 30 percent of CO₂ 
emissions, 33 percent of methane emissions, 8 percent of N₂O emissions

 — Mobility, consisting of road, aviation, rail, maritime, and other forms of transportation: 

19 percent of CO₂ emissions, and 2 percent of N₂O emissions 

 — Buildings, including heating and cooking: 6 percent of CO₂ emissions 

 — Agriculture, consisting of direct on-farm energy use and emissions from agricultural 

practices and fishing: 1 percent of CO₂ emissions, 38 percent of methane emissions, and 
79 percent of N₂O emissions

 — Forestry and other land use, primarily land cover change: 14 percent of CO₂ emissions, 

5 percent of methane emissions, and 5 percent of N₂O emissions

 — Waste, consisting of solid waste disposal and treatment, incineration, and wastewater 

treatment: 23 percent of methane emissions, 3 percent of N₂O emissions

Carbon dioxide in each case is emitted through the combustion of fossil fuels to produce 
energy (oil, gas, and coal), as well as through non-energy emissions (for example, emissions 
associated with industrial processes like the reduction of iron ore to produce steel and with 
deforestation). Based on current accounting methodologies, energy-related emissions make 
up as much as 83 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.6

Reaching net-zero emissions 
will require a transformation 
of the global economy.

6  Notably, this is based on the current system of emissions measurement, in which forestry emissions in particular are 
considered as net emissions, considering their role as both sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. Considering only 
their role as gross sources of emissions, and accounting for second-order effects of deforestation, would substantially 
increase the contribution of forestry as sources of emissions. For further details, see chapter 3.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringBox E3

Physical risks will continue to build up until net zero is achieved 

As average temperatures rise, acute hazards such as heat waves and floods increase 
in frequency and severity, and chronic hazards, such as drought and rising sea levels, 
intensify.1 These hazards and changes could lead to rising, nonlinear, and systemic 
socioeconomic impacts, as described in our 2020 report on physical climate risk.2 
Most recently, the Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6) reaffirmed that continued GHG emissions will 
result in increasingly severe consequences for the Earth system and, potentially, abrupt 
and catastrophic changes that might occur as the climate passes tipping points.3 

As physical climate risk spreads, it could trigger broader economic, financial, and social 
disruptions.4 Estimates suggest that failing to limit the rise of greenhouse gas emissions 
could affect between 2 and 20 percent of global GDP by 2050 under a high-emissions 
(RCP 8.5) scenario.5 The wide range reflects the intrinsic difficulty in making these 
estimates. The effect of hard-to-predict biotic feedback loops (for example, the thawing 
of permafrost) or knock-on economic effects (for example, from impacts on financial 
valuations) could push losses well beyond the high-end estimate. 

To stabilize the climate and limit physical climate risks, climate science tells us that it 
is necessary to reduce the addition of GHGs to the atmosphere to net zero and limit 
warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels to reduce the odds of initiating the most 
dangerous and irreversible effects of climate change.6 Global emissions of carbon 
dioxide are about 40 gigatons (GtCO₂) today. Emissions of CO₂ have risen significantly 
since 1970, though the rate of growth has slowed in recent years.7 The IPCC AR6 report 
estimated that restricting all future net CO₂ emissions to 400–500 Gt, combined with 
substantial decreases in emissions of short-lived GHGs like methane, would result in 
a 50 to 67 percent probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.8 
At current emissions rates, the carbon budget for 1.5°C of warming would thus likely 
be exceeded within about the next decade. Climate science tells us that the Earth 
system will continue to change along the journey to net zero and that some changes will 
continue even after we have stopped the planet from warming; thus, actions to reduce 
emissions will also need to go hand-in-hand with adaptation.9 Decisions taken over the 
next decade will thus be crucial.

warming to 2.0°C. At current emissions rates, the carbon budget for 1.5°C of warming would be exceeded in 
approximately the next decade, and the 2.0°C budget would be exceeded in about three decades.

Effective decarbonization actions include shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels and 
toward zero-emissions electricity and other low-emissions energy carriers such as hydrogen; 
adapting industrial and agricultural processes; increasing energy efficiency and managing 
demand for energy; utilizing the circular economy; consuming fewer emissions-intensive 
goods; deploying carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCS) technology; and enhancing 
sinks of both long-lived and short-lived greenhouse gases. Avoiding deforestation and 
enabling forest restoration are particularly important for restoring and enhancing GHG sinks.7 
Recent McKinsey research on what it would take to achieve a 1.5°C pathway examined a range 
of scenarios and found that the above actions would need to be deployed across all sectors in 
the economy and would require emissions-reduction efforts beginning today.8

7  Estimates suggest that over a 30-year period, a tree can store an additional 60 to 85 percent as much carbon as is 

released when the tree is cut down or burned, and that overall secondary emissions and forgone carbon sequestration 
resulting from deforestation can be three to nine times higher than the direct emissions alone. Research indicates that 
forgone carbon sequestration and forest degradation are highly underestimated in current evaluations of deforestation 
emissions. For details, see chapters 1 and 3.

McKinsey & CompanyA key feature of any transition to net-zero emissions is its universality, across energy and land-
use systems and throughout the global economy. This is for two reasons. First, each of these 
energy and land-use systems contributes substantially to emissions. Thus, every one of these 
systems will need to undergo transformation if the net-zero goal is to be achieved. Second, 
these systems are highly interdependent; actions to reduce emissions must thus take place 
in concert and at scale across systems, economic sectors, and geographies. For instance, 
electric vehicles are valuable only to the extent that low-emissions electricity production 
has been achieved. All sectors of the economy participate in these energy and land-use 
systems across global value chains. Similarly, all countries contribute to emissions, either 
directly or through their role in value chains. Reaching net-zero emissions will thus require a 
transformation of the global economy. 

A net-zero transition would have 
a significant and often front-
loaded effect on demand, capital 
allocation, costs, and jobs 

Decarbonizing the energy and land-use systems described previously will be possible only if 
nine system-level requirements are met. They encompass physical building blocks, economic 
and societal adjustments, and governance, institutions, and commitment (see Box E4, “The 
net-zero ‘equation’ and system-level requirements to help solve it”). 

This report focuses on the economic and societal adjustments needed for a net-zero 
transition. We illustrate the significant adjustments that would need to be made through 
an analysis of the nature and the magnitude of the transition on demand, capital allocation, 
costs, and jobs. Various other knock-on effects could also ensue and affect, for example, 
value pools, financial valuations, GDP, and global trade flows. While we do not quantify these, 
we discuss some of them qualitatively throughout the report.9 Specific aspects include 
the following: 

 —  Demand: Changes in policies, technologies, and consumer and investor preferences 

under a net-zero transition could increase demand for low-emissions goods and services 
and lower demand for high-emissions ones, in turn causing changes across value chains.

 —  Capital allocation: Decarbonizing the global economy and securing low emissions going 

forward would require significant capital spending on the formation of new physical assets 
and the transformation of existing ones.

 —  Costs: Operating and production costs would change as low-emissions processes 
are implemented, investment is made, and energy consumption shifts toward low-
emissions sources.

 —  Jobs: Workforce requirements would evolve as markets are reshaped and organizations 

institute new operational practices and processes.

Our analysis using the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario is a hypothetical simulation, not a 
projection or a prediction. Our perspectives on demand, investment, costs, and jobs below 
represent a consistent and interdependent view of the world under this scenario. The analysis 
is not exhaustive, and we acknowledge its limitations and uncertainties.

9  We have focused on quantifying the direct shifts, given the vast uncertainties involved in modeling these higher-order 

effects, and because their outcome could vary based on specific actions taken to manage them. For further details on our 
methodology, see Box E1.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringBox E4

The net-zero ‘equation’ and system-level requirements to help solve it 

Prior research by McKinsey Sustainability makes the point that achieving net zero is akin to solving an equation—one that 
balances sources and sinks of emissions by reducing GHG emissions as much as possible while increasing GHG stores to 
remove any remaining emissions from the atmosphere.1 To help solve this equation, that research identified nine fundamental, 
interrelated system-level requirements for a net-zero transition. Our research in this report uses these requirements as a 
starting point. We place them into the following three groups:

Physical building blocks, encompassing (1) technological innovation; (2) ability to create at-scale supply chains and support 
infrastructure; and (3) availability of necessary natural resources. Past McKinsey research suggests that there is a line of 
sight to the technologies needed to limit warming to 1.5ºC above preindustrial levels, although continued innovation is still 
needed.2 Further innovation, both to develop new technologies that can be deployed at scale and to reduce their costs, will 
be needed nonetheless. For example, under a 1.5ºC pathway, the number of solar panels installed globally per week would 
be approximately eight times higher than the number today. The rate of wind-turbine installations would need to increase 
fivefold.3 And natural resources, including raw materials such as copper, nickel, rare-earth metals, land, and water, would also 
need to be carefully managed to ensure sufficient availability and minimize bottlenecks, and prevent price spikes and inflation. 
Building out supply chains to support the kind of step change in deployment needed requires not only significant capital and 
the right capabilities but also extensive coordination. 

Economic and societal adjustments, comprising (4) effective capital reallocation and financing structures; (5) management 
of demand shifts and near-term unit cost increases; and (6) compensating mechanisms to address socioeconomic impacts. As 
we discuss in this research, an orderly transition to net zero would require significant changes to capital allocation. Companies 
and countries would need to manage the demand shift and cost changes from a wholesale revamping of energy and land-use 
systems, even as the implications for individuals and communities for livelihoods and expenditures could be substantial.

Governance, institutions, and commitment, consisting of (7) governing standards, tracking and market mechanisms, 
and effective institutions; (8) commitment by, and collaboration among, public-, private-, and social-sector leaders globally; 
and (9) support from citizens and consumers. The pace, scale, and systemic nature of the required transition mean that all 
stakeholders will need to play a role, working together in new ways. Securing an orderly transition will require leaders who 
have the commitment and capabilities to develop coherent, reliable, and workable policies and help their organizations 
navigate the changes that lie ahead. The transition is also unlikely to occur without the support of citizens and consumers, and 
in some cases, consumers may need to fundamentally shift behaviors to reduce their own emissions. 

As stakeholders have increased their commitments to net zero, moving to action has not proven easy or straightforward. This 
is for five reasons: first, the scale and pace of the step-up in spending needed on physical assets, given that entire energy 
and land-use systems evolved over a century or two and would need to be transformed over the next 30 years; second, the 
collective and global action required, particularly as the burdens of the transition would not be evenly felt; third, the near-
term shifts needed for longer-term benefits; fourth, the shifts needed in business practices and lifestyles that have evolved 
over decades; and fifth, the central role of energy in all economic activity, which means that transformation would need to be 
carefully managed. Indeed, the transition involves the transformation of the most important systems supporting our lives and 
well-being. Even small disturbances to these systems could affect daily lives, from raising producer and consumer costs to 
impairing energy access, and could lead to delays and public backlash. Together, these factors highlight why the prevailing 
notion of enlightened self-interest alone is unlikely to be sufficient to help achieve net zero.

In this report, we focus on the second of these groupings of requirements, the economic and societal adjustments, to better 
understand these challenges and how stakeholders can respond. There is a real risk that transition costs could be unbearable 
to many in the absence of compensating measures; for example, if companies and countries do not manage the shifts in 
demand or cost impacts to their existing products and services, or if communities are left behind as the world transitions to a 
net-zero economy.

Europe found that more than 85 percent of today’s emissions in Europe can be abated with already demonstrated technologies, including 28 percent that are mature 
and 32 percent that are in the early-adoption phase (although it is important to note that the pathway to deploying these technologies is still uncertain and would 
require addressing the other requirements mentioned here).

McKinsey & CompanyDemand: In the net-zero scenario examined here, high-emissions 
products would see shrinking demand, while uptake of low-
emissions products would create growth opportunities

Our analysis suggests that under the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, changes in policies, 
technologies, and consumer and investor preferences would lead to considerable shifts 
in demand for various goods and services (Exhibit E4). By 2050, oil and gas production 
volumes would be 55 percent and 70 percent lower, respectively, than they are today. Coal 
production for energy use would nearly end by 2050. Similarly, the transition would affect 
demand for products that use fossil fuels. Demand for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars 
would eventually cease as sales of battery-electric and fuel cell-electric cars increase from 
5 percent of new car sales in 2020 to virtually 100 percent by 2050.

In other sectors, demand could shift, with a substitution of products manufactured with 
emissions-intensive operations to lower-emission alternatives. For example, steel production 
would increase by about 10 percent relative to today, but with low-emissions steel rising from 
one-quarter of all production to almost all production by 2050. In the agriculture and food 
system, the dietary shifts necessary for a net-zero transition would, over time and in the case 
of some consumers, move protein demand from emissions-intensive beef and lamb to lower-
emissions foods like poultry. 

In other areas, in particular those related to low-emissions energy sources, demand would 
grow.10 Power demand in 2050 would be more than double what it is today. Production of both 
hydrogen and biofuels would increase more than tenfold between 2021 and 2050.11 Other 
industries, such as those that manage carbon with nature-based solutions or carbon capture 
and storage technologies, could also grow (see also discussion later on opportunities from 
the transition). For example, forestry and other land use would contribute to sequestering 
approximately nine metric gigatons of CO₂ by the middle of the century. 

Capital allocation: About $275 trillion of cumulative spending on 
physical assets would be needed through 2050 under the NGFS 
Net Zero 2050 scenario

Shifts in demand during the net-zero transition would trigger the retirement or transformation 
of some existing physical assets and the acquisition of new ones. Our analysis suggests that 
these moves would influence spending on physical assets in two ways. First, spending would 
increase significantly relative to today. Second, a portion of the capital that is now being spent 
on high-emissions assets would be spent on low-emissions assets, including those with 
CCS installed.12

Our analysis of the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario suggests that about $275 trillion in 
cumulative spending on physical assets, or approximately $9.2 trillion per year, would be 
needed between 2021 and 2050 across the sectors that we studied (Exhibit E5).13

10  Increased energy access relative to today and growing population and incomes globally would also drive some of the 

increase described here.

11  For hydrogen, this excludes captive production for industrial end uses such as refineries and chemicals.
12  Our analysis divides high-emissions assets from low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure. Low-emissions 

assets have a relatively low emissions footprint; the term does not always mean carbon neutral. This segmentation was 
done to allow us to size the scale of capital reallocation needed for the net-zero transition. In doing so, we recognize that 
the demarcation between high and low emissions is not always clear. Low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure 
include assets for blue-hydrogen production with CCS; green-hydrogen production using electricity and biomass; 
biofuel production; generation of wind, solar, hydro-, geothermal, biomass, gas with CCS, and nuclear power along with 
transmission and distribution and storage infrastructure; heat production from low-emissions sources such as biomass; 
steel furnaces using EAF, DRI with hydrogen, basic oxygen furnaces with CCS; cement kilns with biomass or fossil fuel 
kilns with CCS; zero-emissions vehicles and supporting infrastructure; heating equipment for buildings run on electricity 
or biomass, including heat pumps; district heating connections; cooking technology not based on fossil fuels; building 
insulation; GHG-efficient farming practices; food crops, poultry and egg production; land restoration.

13  Based on analysis of systems that account for about 85 percent of overall GHG emissions today. This estimation 

includes spend for physical assets across various forms of energy supply (for example, power systems, hydrogen, and 
biofuel supply), energy demand (for example, for vehicles and alternate methods of steel and cement production), and 
various forms of land use (for example, GHG-efficient farming practices). This includes both what is typically considered 
investment in national accounts and spend, in some cases, on consumer durables such as personal cars. We typically 
consider spending to replace physical assets at the point of emissions (for example, cars for mobility); additional spending 
would also occur through the value chain. We have not sized this, to minimize double counting.

1. We have sized the total spending on physical assets in power, mobility, fossil fuels, biofuels, hydrogen, heat, CCS (not including storage), buildings, industry (steel and 
cement), agriculture, and forestry. Estimation includes spend for physical assets across various forms of energy supply (eg, power systems, hydrogen, and biofuel 
supply), energy demand (eg, for vehicles, alternate methods of steel and cement production), and various forms of land use (eg, GHG-efficient farming practices).
2. Based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2). Based on analysis of systems that account for ~85% of overall CO₂ emissions today. 
Spend estimates are higher than others in the literature because we have included spend on high-carbon technologies, agriculture, and other land use, and taken a 
more expansive view of the spending required in end-use sectors. 

3. Our analysis divides high-emissions assets from low-emissions assets. High-emissions assets include assets for fossil fuel extraction and refining, as well as fossil fuel 
power production assets without CCS; fossil fuel heat production, gray-hydrogen production; steel BOF; cement fossil fuel kilns; ICE vehicles; fossil fuel heating and 
cooking equipment; dairy, monogastric, and ruminant meat production. Low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure include assets for blue-hydrogen production 
with CCS; green-hydrogen production using electricity and biomass; biofuel production; generation of wind, solar, hydro-, geothermal, biomass, gas with CCS, and 
nuclear power along with transmission and distribution and storage infrastructure; heat production from low-emissions sources such as biomass; steel furnaces using 
EAF, DRI with hydrogen, basic oxygen furnaces with CCS; cement kilns with biomass or fossil fuel kilns with CCS; low-emissions vehicles and supporting infrastructure; 
heating equipment for buildings run on electricity or biomass, including heat pumps; district heating connections; cooking technology not based on fossil fuels; building 
insulation; GHG-efficient farming practices; food crops, poultry and egg production; and land restoration.

McKinsey & CompanyThis represents spending related specifically to the deployment of new physical assets 
and to the decarbonization of existing assets. It does not include spending to support other 
adjustments—for example, to reskill and redeploy workers, compensate for stranded assets, 
or account for the loss of value pools in specific parts of the economy. Spending could also be 
higher than sized here, for example, in order to build redundancy into energy systems during 
the transition to avoid supply volatility. Other research to date that has sized investment needs 
for the transition has largely focused on estimating required energy investment. Here we 
expand this to include additional spending categories.14 As a result, our estimates exceed to a 
meaningful degree the $3 trillion to $4.5 trillion of annual spending for the net-zero transition 
that others have estimated.15 

The amount of cumulative spending is equivalent to about 7.5 percent of GDP from 2021 to 
2050. The required spending would be front-loaded, rising from about 6.8 percent of GDP 
today to about 9 percent of GDP between 2026 and 2030 before falling. In dollar terms, 
the increase in annual spending is about $3.5 trillion per year, or 60 percent, more than 
is being spent today, all of which would be spent in the future on low-emissions assets. 
This incremental spending would be worth about 2.8 percent of global GDP between 
2020 and 2050. To put this in comparable terms, the increase is approximately equivalent, 
in 2020, to half of global corporate profits, one-quarter of total tax revenue, 15 percent of 
gross fixed capital formation, and 7 percent of household spending.

The second aspect, the reallocation of spending, would also be significant. At present, 
$3.7 trillion—or 65 percent of total spending—goes annually toward high-emissions assets, 
such as coal-fired power plants and vehicles with internal combustion engines. In this net-
zero scenario, about $1 trillion of today’s spend on high-emissions assets would need to be 
reallocated to low-emissions assets. Of the overall $9.2 trillion needed annually for a net-zero 
transition over the next 30 years, $6.5 trillion—or 70 percent of total spending—would be on 
low-emissions assets, reversing today’s trend. Three sector groups—mobility, power, and 
buildings—would account for approximately 75 percent of the total spending on physical 
assets in this net-zero scenario (see the next section for a detailed discussion of spending 
needed by sector).

Our estimates exceed to a meaningful 
degree the $3 trillion to $4.5 trillion 
of annual spending for the net-zero 
transition that others have estimated.

14  We broadened the analysis to include a more comprehensive view of spending by households and businesses on assets 
that use energy (for example, the full cost of passenger cars and heat pumps), capital expenditures in agriculture and 
forestry, and some continued spend in high-emissions physical assets like fossil fuel–based vehicles and power assets.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringIf we consider the likely evolution of this spending given population growth, GDP growth, and current 
momentum toward the net-zero transition, the capital outlay would be smaller but remain significant. 
If we take as a basis the NGFS Current Policies scenario—which accounts for expected income 
and population growth, as well as currently legislated policies and expected cost reductions in key 
low-emissions technologies—the incremental annual spend in a net-zero scenario would be about 
$0.9 trillion rather than the $3.5 trillion increase noted above (Exhibit E6).16 Approximately 50 percent of 
the $8.3 trillion in annual spending in the Current Policies scenario would be on low-emissions assets, 
which highlights that already some shift to low-emission spending is anticipated in this scenario from 
existing technological trends and policies today. 

The transition could also lead to asset stranding, whereby existing physical assets are either 
underutilized or retired before the end of their useful life. In the context of the net-zero transition, the 
capital stock associated with fossil fuels and emissions is worth many trillions of dollars, a significant 
share of the total global capital stock—and even more capital stock depends indirectly on these assets. 

Stranding large portions of this capital stock in a disorderly or abrupt way could impede value generation 
in many industrial sectors and indeed the global economy and would therefore need to be carefully 
managed. In power alone, for example, we estimate that some $2.1 trillion worth of assets could be 
stranded by 2050. About 80 percent of these stranded assets would pertain to fossil fuel–based 
power plants in operation today, primarily coal-fired plants in countries such as China and India that are 
relatively new (less than 15 years old) and would normally have many more years of productive life.17

Moreover, many assets that could be stranded are capitalized on the balance sheets of listed companies. 
Early retirement of these assets would potentially lead to the reduction of (currently perceived) value and 
to bankruptcies and credit defaults, with potential knock-on effects on the global financial system. And 
markets may well pronounce their verdict before the actual stranding has taken place. Unsurprisingly, 
then, the possibility of asset stranding has prompted concerns about financial-sector risk and the need 
to build the capabilities to quantify and manage it.18

While the scale of the capital that would need to be deployed in a net-zero transition is substantial, 
it is important to put it in context. First and foremost, as we discuss later, the economic adjustments 
involved in reaching net zero in a coordinated and orderly manner would prevent the further buildup 
of physical risks and the additional costs arising from a more disorderly transition. Second, in the long 
run, the up-front capital expenditures for a net-zero transition could result in operating savings for 
some sectors through reduced fuel consumption, improved material and energy efficiency, and lower 
maintenance costs. 

The up-front capital expenditures for a net-
zero transition could result in operating 
savings for some sectors in the long run.

16  The NGFS Current Policies scenario projects the greenhouse gas emissions that would occur if only today’s policies remained in place, 

and it anticipates about 3°C of warming by 2100. See Box E1 and the technical appendix.

17  Our definition of stranded assets represents the cumulative value of prematurely retired and underutilized assets in 2020–50, 

undiscounted. We estimate it by first identifying the level of yearly depreciation that is expected given asset life and assumed economic 
life using data from the WRI Global Power Plant database as input. That figure was multiplied by the fraction of assets that are 
underutilized relative to past average utilization rates (between 2005 and 2020) and summed across years. Other research has found 
similar effects on the power sector, and other sectors. See, for example, Stranded assets and renewables: How the energy transition 
affects the value of energy reserves, buildings and capital stock, International Renewable Energy Agency, 2017; David Nelson et al.,

1. We have sized the total spending on physical assets in power, mobility, fossil fuels, biofuels, hydrogen, heat, CCS (not including storage), buildings, industry (steel and 
cement), agriculture, and forestry. Estimation includes spend for physical assets across various forms of energy supply (for example, power systems, hydrogen, and 
biofuel supply), energy demand (for example, for vehicles, alternate methods of steel and cement production), and various forms of land use (for example, GHG-
efficient farming practices). This includes both what are typically considered “investments” in national accounts and spend, in some cases, on consumer durables such 
as personal cars. Annual average over 5-year periods.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringIt is also important to recognize that capital spending is not merely a cost. Much of this 
investment is already cost-effective and comes with a return. For example, research analyzing 
other net-zero scenarios has found that about 40–50 percent of spending can come with a 
positive investment case.19 

Various challenges will need to be managed in the short run to achieve such outcomes. 
They include raising capital and securing financing at this scale, managing technological 
uncertainty of investment, considering risk/return trade-offs, and driving capital flows to both 
developed and developing countries. Raising and deploying capital could be more challenging 
for specific sectors and geographies.

Capital spending is not 
merely a cost: much of this 
investment is already 
cost-effective and comes 
with a return.

19  McKinsey research finds that about half of the required investments to reach net-zero emissions in Europe have a positive 
investment case. This means that switching to the relevant low-emissions technology would represent a cost saving at the 
cost of capital for each sector and segment. See Paolo D’Aprile, Hauke Engel, Godart van Gend, Stefan Helmcke, Solveigh 
Hieronimus, Tomas Nauclér, Dickon Pinner, Daan Walter, and Maaike Witteveen, “How the European Union could achieve 
net-zero emissions at net-zero cost,” McKinsey & Company, November 2020. The IEA also examined the actions required 
to be taken by consumers in the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario such as switching to low-emissions vehicles. They find that 
40 percent would result in overall cost savings relative to an Announced Polices scenario where governments follow 
through on their climate targets and commitments. See World economic outlook, IEA, 2021. On the macroeconomic 
level, higher levels of public and private investment could provide economic stimulus, leading to negligible net negative 
impacts, or even modest net positive impacts, on GDP growth (though as discussed, much depends on how the transition 
is financed and managed). For example, the European Commission found in conducting an impact assessment for 
proposed 2030 net-zero-aligned emissions targets for the European Union that raising policy ambition would result in 
a cumulative impact of between -0.7 percent and +0.55 percent on GDP by 2030 compared to a baseline forecast. See

McKinsey & CompanyCosts: Steel, cement, and power would see cost increases in the 
Net Zero 2050 scenario, due to shifts in production processes and 
capital expenditures, while total cost of ownership of EVs would fall

The transition’s financial implications reach beyond spending on physical assets. Production 
costs, which reflect changing operating costs as well as capital costs for new investment and 
asset depreciation, would also shift as processes are changed and high-emissions assets are 
replaced or retrofitted. And any changes in production costs could possibly affect the costs of 
consumer goods, if costs are passed through. We examine these effects in turn.

In the steel and cement sectors, production costs, including operating costs, capital charges, 
and depreciation, could rise by about 30 percent and 45 percent, respectively, from their 
current levels, though continued innovation could lower these estimates. In the power sector, 
our analysis indicates that the global average delivered cost of electricity across generation, 
transmission, distribution, and storage would increase before falling from their peak, in the 
scenario modeled here. The impact would be front-loaded: costs would increase by about 
25 percent by 2040, including operating costs, capital costs, and depreciation of new and 
existing assets, from 2020 levels (Exhibit E7). This is for two main reasons: firstly, investments 
will be needed in building renewables and grid and storage capacity, creating capital costs 
and depreciation charges. Secondly, some fossil-based power assets would continue to incur 
capital costs, even if they are underutilized or retired prematurely.20 This analysis represents a 
global average perspective. The picture could look different across regions depending on the 
current state of the power system, the availability of natural resources like sunshine and wind, 
and the age of fossil power fleets, among other factors. It is conceivable that innovation and 
economies of scale could drive down capital and grid spending. Delivered cost of electricity in 
the first half of the century could then be lower than anticipated in the scenario. 

On the other hand, impacts could be significantly higher than those sized here (though it is 
important to note that costs as sized here are not the same as consumer electricity prices). 
Various factors could contribute to this, including potential grid intermittency issues as 
renewable assets are scaled up, shortage of fossil fuel–based capacity to serve peak loads 
and provide backup for renewables, and shortage of coal and gas inputs for fossil fuel power 
plants, to name a few. The potential impacts of such outages would be even greater with 
electricity being used more extensively across the economy than today under a net-zero 
transition, for example for heating, mobility, and industry. If the shift from high-emissions 
fossil fuel–based power assets and the ramp-up of low-emissions assets that replace them 
is not well managed, this could increase both energy prices and volatility and there could be 
challenges with reliable power. (See Box E5, “How rising energy prices can create risk.”)  

20  To assess cost changes for power, we first quantified the change in three main cost drivers: power generation capital 
charge and depreciation (at a weighted average cost of capital of 6.5 percent), power generation operating costs, and 
transmission, distribution, and storage investments. These were then translated into a delivered cost of electricity by 
dividing by electricity production in each time period. This metric indicates how the underlying costs are changing for 
the entire power sector. Our methodology is broader than other studies focused on the levelized cost of energy for new 
assets which often highlight the competitive cost position of renewables in the power mix. Our analysis also takes into 
account infrastructure spending on grids, capital charges, and depreciation of legacy assets even if they are prematurely 
retired or underutilized. See also Rupert Way et al., Empirically grounded technology forecasts and the energy transition, 
Institute for New Economic Thinking Oxford, working paper number 2021-01, September 2021. Note that our metric is 
different from the actual cost paid by consumers, and eventual energy prices for consumers could look substantially 
different. Consumer electricity prices depend on a multitude of factors, including decisions on how the power system 
transformation is paid for and over what time frame. For example, a key question is how to best manage coal generation 
decommissioning and write-down costs. Moreover not all expected changes in delivered costs are due to decarbonization. 
For instance, some transmission and distribution investments would happen regardless, as countries increase electricity 
access. This analysis does not take into account short-term variations in supply and demand, subsidies, or taxes.

To assess cost changes for power, we first quantified the change in three main cost drivers: power generation capital charge (at a weighted average cost of capital
of 6.5 percent), power generation operating costs, and transmission, distribution and storage investments. These were then translated into the delivered cost of

same as consumer electricity prices. The trends described here are global averages and would vary across regions.

Resources Institute Power Plant Database; McKinsey Power Solutions; McKinsey Global Institute analysis

In the scenario modeled here, costs would subsequently decrease from the 2040 peak; 
for example, by 2050, operating costs for generation could drop by more than 60 percent 
relative to 2020 as the energy mix shifts to renewables. Some of the reduction in operating 
and other costs for generation would be offset by an increase in the operating and other costs 
associated with grid flexibility, transmission, and distribution. As a result, delivered cost of 
electricity in this scenario would still be about 20 percent higher in 2050 than 2020 levels. In 
the long run, there is more uncertainty about how delivered cost of electricity could evolve, 
and costs could at some point be lower than 2020 levels, depending on innovations to power 
technologies, grid design, and evolution of the power system to manage flexibility issues. 

Other sectors could see overall cost decreases. A key example of this is mobility. Our analysis 
suggests that the total cost of ownership for electric cars could be cheaper than ICE cars 
in most regions by 2025, as we describe in more detail below.21 Medium-duty BEV trucks 
covering 200–300 km a day are expected to reach total cost parity with ICEs by around 2025, 
with heavy-duty long-haul trucks reaching parity by 2030 in Europe and later in other regions.

21  Total cost of ownership accounts for purchase price, operating costs, for instance fuel and maintenance costs, and resale 

value; based on three years of ownership of a new car.

How rising energy prices can create risk 

Global energy prices surged in the third quarter of 2021, providing a glimpse of the speed with which market imbalances can 
feed through to consumers and prompt swift government reactions including subsidies to low-income households.

Natural gas price benchmarks in Europe and Asia were ten times higher in October 2021 than one year prior, while US month-
ahead natural gas prices reached their highest level since 2008. International coal prices were also sharply higher, at five 
times their fall 2020 levels.1 Rising primary fuel prices sparked large increases in consumer electricity prices in Germany, 
Spain, and elsewhere in Europe. In the United States, gasoline pump prices of $3.50 per gallon were the highest in seven 
years.2 Deteriorating margins for energy providers and electricity-intensive industries such as fertilizer production forced 
several companies to curtail operations.3 

Energy prices are already a highly critical topic given the centrality of energy to consumers and economic activity—even under 
normal circumstances. For example, according to the European Commission, 31 million Europeans live in energy poverty and 
are unable to adequately heat their homes.4 To help alleviate price rises, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and 
the United States announced in November 2021 they would be tapping into their respective strategic oil reserves.5 Some 
governments also initiated subsidy programs. These included the US making available a $4 billion budget for the Low Income 
Energy Assistance Program, providing aid to more than five million families.6 Italy and Spain capped home energy bills and 
redirected utility company profits to subsidize low-income households and small enterprises.7

A confluence of factors led to the price fluctuations, including a rebound in consumer activity as lockdowns related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic eased along with persistent labor and supply chain shortages. In some instances, weather events 
exacerbated the situation, including low wind speeds in the North Sea, a cold snap in Texas that led to a gas production shut-
in, drought in Brazil that depleted hydropower reservoir levels to 25 percent below their five-year average, and flooding of 
Chinese coal mines that exacerbated shortages driven in part by the recent freeze on coal imports from Australia.8 

Such events, while not directly attributed to a net-zero transition, nonetheless shine a light on supply chain and grid 
vulnerabilities. In doing so, they can serve as a cautionary preview of potential future energy market volatility that can be 
triggered by rapid simultaneous shifts on the supply and demand sides of the global energy and materials landscape. 
For example, as reliance on renewables grows and investment in fossil fuel–based power generation declines, tight supply for 
raw material inputs for technologies like solar panels and batteries may compound energy price volatility given long lead times 
in the capital-intensive mining sector. As the world acts on net-zero pledges, periods of energy price volatility like those in the 
last months of 2021, among others, thus serve as a reminder of the importance of careful transition management.

Exposure to these risks would also increase with electrification as a key pillar of the transition. Power outages, whether due 
to the energy mix, weather or operator error, would have far-reaching consequences where households and businesses are 
depending on a reliable source of electricity for day-to-day needs such as heating, cooling, appliances, vehicles, and industrial 
applications. As the mix of the power system shifts to renewables in the net-zero transition we have analyzed here, various 
factors could influence the delivered cost of electricity, and also electricity prices for consumers. First, as already noted, 
the delivered cost of electricity would initially rise in the Net Zero 2050 scenario as power generation assets are replaced 
and transmission, distribution, and storage capacity is built. Increases in these costs could even be higher than calculated 
here, with implications for prices and with more volatility, for the various reasons discussed previously. Second, storage and 
transmission costs, which constitute a substantial portion of the cost of electricity, could feed through to consumers in an 
uneven way, with some paying more while others experience savings. This will depend in part on a range of localized factors 
including existing transmission and distribution capacity and the need for long duration storage. Finally, market design 
could be an important factor: as the power system changes, power markets may need to change with it. Today, power is sold 
through the spot market, in which prices are set according to production costs of the marginal power producer, and through 
bilateral purchase agreements between power producers and consumers. Capacity markets have historically accounted for 
a relatively small share of power sales, but they may play a larger role in the future to fully compensate flexible producers that 
help balance the grid. New market mechanisms may be needed to encourage some marginal fossil fuel power producers to 
decommission their plants earlier. Key questions remain about how this would be paid for, and also how cost increases, if any, 
would affect end consumers.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringConsumers would face additional up-front capital costs and may need 
to spend more in the near term on electricity if cost increases are 
passed through; lower-income households everywhere are naturally 
more at risk 

The net-zero transition could also affect consumer spending. Consumers may face higher 
prices and up-front capital costs in the near term and may need to adjust their spending if 
significant emissions reductions are to be achieved, although the extent of the impact could 
vary depending on the composition of consumers’ spending baskets and whether companies 
pass on costs, among other factors.22 Low-income households are particularly at risk. 
Over time, all consumers could see some benefits.

First, consumers’ spending habits may be affected by decarbonization efforts. For example, 
they may need to replace goods that burn fossil fuels, like transportation vehicles and home 
heating systems that rely on fossil fuels, and potentially modify diets to reduce beef and 
lamb consumption. 

Second, any rise in electricity prices would affect consumers, particularly lower-income 
consumers, whose spend on energy makes up a large share of wallet. However, this depends 
on how cost recovery is allocated among consumers, up to and including the extent any 
increases in delivered cost of electricity are passed through to end consumers.

Third, consumers would incur up-front capital costs related in particular to the mobility 
and buildings transition. For example, as ICE vehicles are phased out, households would 
shift spending to EVs, which cost more than comparable ICE cars because of their large 
batteries. Even though, in the long term, consumers could benefit over the life of the asset—
for example, because of the lower total cost of ownership for EVs or savings from energy 
efficiency measures in homes. McKinsey analysis suggests that the total cost to own an EV, 
which takes into account purchase price, maintenance, fuel cost, and resale value, would be 
cheaper than an ICE car in most regions by 2025. For example, the total cost of ownership for 
battery-electric cars in Europe may be cheaper compared to that of ICEs by 2025, and the 
United States by 2030.23 A faster decline in battery prices or local subsidies could accelerate 
this break-even point. Even so, the higher up-front costs may prove challenging for lower-
income households. Food costs are one area where consumer costs could fall if the dietary 
shifts required to decarbonize the agriculture and food sectors manifest—that is, if eating 
habits move away from emissions-intensive and higher-cost ruminant protein like beef and 
lamb to other forms of protein like poultry.24

Finally, higher production costs could also affect the price of consumer goods and services 
in other areas. Higher costs for low-emissions shipping could be passed on to the consumer 
for goods shipped internationally; however, the extent to which this will flow through to higher 
costs for consumers will likely be country- and product-specific.25 Likewise, rising costs in 
hard-to-abate sectors such as steel and cement could raise the cost of end products, though 
this will depend on the fraction of the cost of these materials in final goods and services.26 
All of these could be addressed through a range of compensating mechanisms to ease 
the transition.

22  A comprehensive accounting of the effects on consumers would be complex, since effects vary based on such factors 
as a consumer’s spending basket, whether companies pass through any additional operating or capital costs, and the 
transition’s effect on government revenues and subsidies. Effects on consumers are likely to vary by region. For example, 
developing countries could have a higher proportion of their total spend basket affected by the climate transition, due to 
higher spending on energy. Individuals’ incomes could also be affected by shifts in livelihood or any changes in taxation 
as a result of the transition.

McKinsey & CompanyJobs: The net-zero transition analyzed here could lead to a reallocation 
of labor, with about 200 million direct and indirect jobs gained and 
185 million lost by 2050

Our analysis of the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario suggests that the transition could result in 
an increase in demand for about 162 million direct and indirect jobs (referred to as “job gains”) 
and a decrease in demand for about 152 million direct and indirect jobs (referred to as “job 
losses”) in operations and maintenance by 2050 across different sectors of the economy. 
In addition, about 41 million jobs could be gained and 35 million lost related to direct and 
indirect jobs associated with spending on physical assets needed for the net-zero transition 
by 2050 (Exhibit E8).27 Jobs in the latter category, linked to shifts in capital spending, are 
likely to be more transitory than those in the former, related to operations and maintenance, 
as discussed below. Together, this results in 202 million direct and indirect jobs gained and 
187 million lost by 2050, as a result of the net-zero transition modeled here. When considering 
job losses and gains here, we only consider those which are directly attributable to the net-
zero transition, rather than other factors like income or population growth. The effect on jobs 
would be especially notable not so much for its overall size in terms of net losses or gains as 
for its concentrated, uneven, and re-allocative nature. 

The size of the job dislocation in the scenario analyzed here needs to be put in perspective 
with job dislocations from other trends. For example, previous research by the McKinsey 
Global Institute suggests that automation, remote work, and e-commerce trends could lead to 
job losses of about 270 million to 340 million across eight countries between 2018 and 2030, 
with commensurate job gains—considerably more than our estimates for net-zero transition-
related job losses and gains globally.28 

One notable characteristic in our analysis of the job losses and gains during the net-zero 
transition would be their concentration in specific sectors and geographic regions. Job gains 
would be largely associated with the transition to low-emissions forms of production, for 
example to renewable-power production, while the losses would particularly affect workers 
in fossil fuel–intensive or otherwise emissions-intensive sectors, a significant reallocation of 
jobs across the economy. In the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, demand for direct operations 
and maintenance jobs in the fossil fuel extraction and production sector and the fossil 
fuel–based power sector could be lower by about nine million and about four million jobs, 
respectively—equivalent to about 70 percent and 60 percent of today’s workforce in those 
respective sectors, due to the net-zero transition. Jobs in the agriculture and food sectors 
could also be reallocated as demand for animal protein is affected under a net-zero transition. 
About 34 million direct jobs, mainly in livestock and feed-related jobs, could be lost by 2050, 
including 19 million in ruminant meat farming. These could be partially offset by a gain of 
12 million direct jobs, including for example ten million in poultry farming. 

27  By “direct” jobs we mean jobs in the specified sector, as opposed to “indirect” jobs, which refers to the upstream jobs 
that produce inputs for production in the sector. Job losses and gains described in this analysis refer to those tied 
specifically to transition-related changes (for example, the shift from fossil fuel energy production to solar and wind 
power driving increases in solar and wind power jobs and decreases in coal and gas power jobs). Losses and gains due 
to macroeconomic forces such as income, population, and productivity growth have been excluded. A job is counted as 
a loss or a gain if it involves a shift in sector or subsector for a worker, indicating a changing job function, or a change in 
the geography of an existing job. Job losses and gains could in reality manifest as job shifts. Our methodology does not 
account for any higher order impacts and assumes an orderly transition, for example, without constraints created from 
financing the transition. For further details, see technical appendix.

28  For more information, see The future of work after COVID-19, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2021. It is important 
to note that other factors could influence the job numbers presented here, potentially leading to greater reallocations. 
These include whether the transition is orderly or disorderly, whether financing for the transition limits investment in other 
parts of the economy, and fiscal and monetary policy decisions, which we do not model.

1.

Includes all direct and indirect jobs; based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2). Based on analysis of systems that account for 
~85% of overall emissions today; a job is counted as a gross loss or a gain if it involves a shift in sector or subsector for a worker (indicating a changing job function), or 
geography of an existing job. Operations and maintenance jobs consist of those related to the operations and maintenance activities in the sector (direct jobs), and 
their supply chains (indirect jobs). Capex jobs are those arising from capital investment in the sector, associated with manufacturing and construction (direct jobs), and 
their supply chains (indirect jobs), and are not included in the 2020 baseline number. While calculating indirect jobs, we include upstream jobs from all other sectors of 
the economy such as financial services, wholesale trade, retail trade, transportation, etc, but exclude a set of sectors for which we have done bottom-up calculations, 
including: Agriculture, forestry and fishing, mining and extraction of energy; coke and refined petroleum, other nonmetallic mineral products, manufacture of basic 
metals, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; power; machinery, and equipment and construction. Impacts of a net-zero transition consist of job losses and gains 
directly associated with the transition, and do not include other macroeconomic forces like population or income growth. See technical appendix.

McKinsey & CompanyLow-emissions sectors, by contrast, would likely see job gains. For example, the renewable 
power sector could see an increase in demand for approximately six million direct operations 
and maintenance jobs by 2050 driven by the net-zero transition. As mentioned above, job 
gains could also occur as a result of capital outlays, particularly during the earlier years of the 
transition. In construction, manufacturing, and other industries associated with the build-
out of low-emissions physical assets, net job gains (job gains minus job losses) could be as 
high as about 37 million by 2030 and could still be about five million by 2050 (which further 
emphasizes the potential transitory nature of these jobs). The transition might also create still 
more jobs, as past diffusion of new technologies has done.29 

One notable characteristic in our analysis of 
the job losses and gains during the net-zero 
transition would be their concentration in 
specific sectors and geographic regions.

Job losses that affect entire sectors or subsectors and those that are geographically 
concentrated in specific communities or regions will create particular needs for economic 
and societal adjustments during the transition.30 For example, in 44 US counties, more than 
10 percent of the workforce is employed in the coal, oil, and gas extraction, mining, and 
refining sectors, the fossil fuel–based power sector, and the automotive sector (Exhibit E9). 
Similarly, automotive production is a relatively large share of employment in Germany, Japan, 
Mexico, and South Korea (see also discussion later on how countries are exposed to the net-
zero transition and could benefit from transition opportunities). 

Disruptions would be 
substantially higher under a 
more disorderly transition

How the transition is managed will be decisive. The effects described here reflect the NGFS 
Net Zero 2050 scenario, in which gradual yet substantial reductions in emissions take place, 
resulting in a relatively orderly transition. However, the complexity of the transformation 
may well lead to the reality being more disorderly, and indeed it may not be feasible to limit 
warming levels to 1.5°C. This makes the case for action even more critical.

The key risks are threefold: the first concerns the choice of pathway to arrive at net-zero 
emissions, and whether this will be smooth or abrupt. The second relates to the measures 
taken by stakeholders to ease the adjustments needed for a net-zero transition. The third has 
to do with a range of constraints that could prove challenging even if the pathway chosen is a 
relatively smooth and gradual one. 

29  One study found that 0.56 percent of new jobs in the United States each year are in entirely new occupations that did not 
previously exist. See Jeffrey Lin, “Technological adaptation, cities, and new work,” Review of Economics and Statistics, 
volume 93, number 2, May 2011. See also Jobs lost, jobs gained: What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and 
wages, McKinsey Global Institute, December 2017.

30  As an example, analysis by McKinsey & Company in collaboration with the Greater Houston Partnership finds that Houston 
could lose up to 650,000 jobs by 2050 under a 1.5°C pathway, if no action is taken to respond to the changing energy 
landscape. However, with decisive action to lead in the energy transition, Houston could gain up to 560,000 additional 
jobs. For further details, see Houston: Leading the transition to a low-carbon world, Greater Houston Partnership, 
June 2021.

Some pathways to net-zero emissions assume that the decline in emissions begins 
immediately and progresses gradually to 2050, with appropriate measures in place to 
manage disruptions and limit costs. Others assume that reduction of emissions begins 
later and progresses more quickly to achieve the same amount of cumulative emissions. 
The latter could involve significant and abrupt changes in policy, high carbon prices, and 
sudden changes to investment practices—along with greater socioeconomic effects and a 
larger-scale response.31 Making job transitions would be more challenging, and there could be 
greater risk of stranded assets. 

Second, if actions are not taken to manage transition disruptions, this could lead to more 
challenges, especially for vulnerable communities—for example, if rises in energy costs 
are passed through to low-income households, or if displaced workers are not provided 
appropriate support to reskill and redeploy.

Finally, even if the pathway chosen is relatively orderly, given the scale of the transformation 
required, supply may not be able to scale up sufficiently, making shortages and price 
increases or volatility a feature. Rapidly scaling up demand for low-emissions assets and 
other products needed for the transition, without corresponding scale-up of supply, could 
lead to supply/demand imbalances, shortages, price increases, and inflation.32 As already 
noted, a mismatch or mistiming between the ramping down of high-emissions activities and 
the ramping up of low-emissions activities could create energy price volatility and issues with 
reliability that could potentially result in a backlash that delays the transition. Another risk is 
that stakeholders maintain two parallel energy systems in a manner that is inefficient and not 
cost effective. Thus the transformation of the energy system needs to be carefully managed. 
And there may be other constraints, including accessing the volume of financing required in 
the initial phases of the transition when many of the investments would be front-loaded.

There could also be other costs incurred and investment needed beyond those mentioned 
in this report, for example related to the reskilling of workers, or economic diversification 
efforts. A key area where additional spend would be needed is related to adaptation 
investments. Adaptation action is needed to manage a continually increasing level of physical 
risk, irrespective of the decarbonization measures required to achieve net-zero emissions. 
Key adaptation measures include actions to protect people and assets, for example installing 
“gray” infrastructure such as sea walls, building resilience and backups in systems with 
actions like increasing global inventories and diversifying supply chains, and reducing 
exposure where necessary, for example by relocating assets from regions.

To illustrate the difference between transition pathways, we analyzed two NGFS scenarios 
consistent with limiting warming to less than 2.0°C from preindustrial levels. In the “Below-
2°C scenario,” where emissions reductions start immediately on a pathway to 2.0°C of 
warming, our analysis suggests that only a relatively small amount of additional coal power 
capacity is added, about $150 billion between 2020 and 2050. Of this, $100 billion would be 
prematurely retired or underutilized. But in the scenario where emissions reductions toward 
2.0°C warming start later, a substantially larger amount of capacity would be added; as much 
as $600 billion would be invested in coal-power capacity, with as much as $400 billion 
prematurely retired or underutilized. 

Perhaps the greatest risk from delaying emissions reductions is physical climate risk. 
The longer it takes to initiate emissions reduction, the more of the world’s remaining carbon 
budget would be used up—leaving less time to cut emissions and increasing the risk that 
warming is not restricted to 1.5°C or even 2.0°C.

While significant, these economic 
adjustments would create growth 
opportunities and prevent further 
buildup of physical risk

The changing demand outlook combined with the $3.5 trillion in incremental annual 
spending on physical assets in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, noted above, would create 
substantial growth opportunities for companies and countries in the near term. We describe 
the opportunities for countries later in this summary. The opportunities for companies are in 
the three main areas described below. 

32  For example, see “The raw materials challenge: How the metals and mining sector will be at the core of enabling the energy 

transition,” McKinsey & Company, January 2022. The research describes a scenario based on the current pipeline of 
projects and without measures to incentivize further supply, in which copper and nickel demand in 2030 could exceed 
supply by 5 million to 8 million and 700,000 to one million metric tons, respectively. See also 2022 global outlook: 
Thriving in a new market regime, Blackrock Investment Institute, 2022.

29

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringDecarbonized forms of legacy products and processes: Companies that reduce the 
emissions intensity of their processes and products could gain advantages as the transition 
progresses. In some cases, decarbonizing processes and products can make them more 
cost-effective. For example, improving the energy efficiency of heating systems in steel 
plants lowers both emissions and operating costs. Even when decarbonizing adds to 
operating costs, companies can benefit from taking this step—for instance, if consumers 
are willing to pay more for low-carbon products or if companies are subject to carbon-
pricing mandates.

Low-emissions products and processes that replace established high-emissions 
options: Carmakers might produce EVs instead of ICE vehicles, for example. Steelmakers 
can implement low-carbon production processes such as direct reduced iron–electric 
arc furnaces (DRI-EAF) powered by green hydrogen.33 Utilities might set up wind or solar 
farms to generate renewable electricity, while energy companies could introduce biofuels 
and hydrogen. 

Inputs, physical capital, infrastructure, and support services: New offerings will be 
needed to support production in the other two categories. These offerings include inputs 
such as lithium and cobalt for battery manufacturing, physical capital such as solar panels and 
batteries, and infrastructure such as EV charging stations and hydrogen refueling stations.34 
Technical services such as forest management, engineering and design, and power-system 
integration will help with the management of low-carbon assets. Services such as financing, 
risk management, certification, emissions measurement and tracking solutions, and worker 
training will also be needed. 

The incremental capital spending on physical assets, which we estimate at about 3 percent 
of GDP annually through 2050, as discussed previously, and the broader economic 
transformations under a net-zero transition would have another essential feature: most 
importantly, reaching net-zero emissions and limiting warming to 1.5°C would prevent the 
buildup of physical risks and reduce the odds of initiating the most catastrophic impacts of 
climate change, including limiting the risk of biotic feedback loops and preserving the ability 
to halt additional warming.35

Rapidly scaling up demand for low-
emissions assets and other products needed 
for the transition, without corresponding 
scale-up of supply, could lead to supply 
shortages and price increases.

33  DRI is produced from the chemical reduction of iron ore into iron by either a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced 
from natural gas or coal, which can be used as an input, along with high-grade steel scrap, in the EAF method of steel 
production. Steel production in integrated blast furnaces or basic oxygen furnaces today uses iron ore and requires coal 
as a reductant. See Christian Hoffmann, Michel Van Hoey, and Benedikt Zeumer, “Decarbonization challenge for steel,” 
McKinsey & Company, June 2020.

34  For example, see “The raw materials challenge: How the metals and mining sector will be at the core of enabling the 

energy transition,” McKinsey & Company, January 2022. The research finds that requirement for additional supply will 
come not only from relatively large-volume raw materials—for example, copper for electrification and nickel for battery 
EVs, which are expected to see significant demand growth beyond their current applications—but also from relatively 
niche commodities, such as lithium and cobalt for batteries, tellurium for solar panels, and neodymium for the permanent 
magnets used both in wind power generation and EVs. Some commodities—most notably steel—will also play an enabling 
role across technologies, as additional infrastructure is needed.

35  See Box E3 in the executive summary, chapter 1, and the bibliography for a detailed list of the academic literature and 

broader discussion related to physical climate risks.

McKinsey & CompanySectors are unevenly exposed to 
the transition; those with high-
emissions products or operations 
would be especially affected

We find that, while all sectors of the economy are exposed to a net-zero transition because 
of their participation in energy and land-use systems, some are more exposed than others. 
The sectors with the highest degree of exposure directly emit significant quantities of 
greenhouse gases (for example, the coal and gas power sector) or sell products that emit 
greenhouse gases (such as the fossil fuel sector). Approximately 20 percent of global GDP 
is in these sectors. A further 10 percent of GDP is in sectors with high-emissions supply 
chains, such as construction. Other sectors accounting for about 70 percent of GDP have 
less pronounced direct exposure. They are nevertheless dependent on the highly exposed 
sectors, for example through interconnected economic and financial systems, and therefore 
could be affected by the transition.

In this section, we describe the economic shifts for some of the most affected sectors. 
Together they account for about 85 percent of global GHG emissions through their operations 
or products, and we present our analysis of the economic changes they would likely 
experience in the Net Zero 2050 scenario.36  

Fossil fuels. As noted earlier, combustion of fossil fuels produces 83 percent of global CO₂ 
emissions. The sector is seeking to decarbonize its own emissions through energy efficiency, 
electrification, and managing fugitive methane emissions.37 At the same time, it faces 
significant demand shifts from potential shifts in the energy mix under a net-zero transition, 
with a reduction in demand for fossil fuels and growing demand for other energy sources such 
as electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels. In the scenario analyzed here, oil and gas production 
volumes in 2050  would be 55 percent and 70 percent lower, respectively, than today. 
Coal production for energy use would be nearly eliminated. Under the net-zero transition, 
demand for jobs within the fossil fuel extraction and production sector could be lower by 
about nine million direct jobs by 2050. In response, McKinsey research suggests that a 
number of oil and gas companies are adapting to the low-carbon transition by becoming 
resource specialists, becoming diversified energy players, or turning themselves into low-
carbon pure plays.38

Power. To decarbonize, the global power sector would need to phase out fossil fuel–
based generation and add capacity for low-emissions power to meet the additional 
demand arising from both economic development and the growing electrification of 
other sectors. It would require substantial annual capital spending from 2021 to 2050, 
which we estimate at about $1 trillion in power generation, $820 billion in the power grid, 
and $120 billion in energy storage in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. Opportunities 
would arise not only for power producers but also for providers of equipment, electricity-
storage hardware, and related services. Our analysis suggests that by 2050, under a 
net-zero transition, approximately six million direct jobs could be added in operations 
and maintenance for renewable power and approximately four million direct jobs could be 

36  We estimate how much exposure these sectors have to the transition by measuring their direct emissions (scope 1 

emissions, which indicate exposure to potential demand shifts, investment needs, and cost changes from having to 
alter production processes), emissions from products (downstream scope 3, which may affect demand, for example, if 
consumers shift their preferences, and in turn also affect the capital investments made by the sector and its costs), supply 
chain emissions (upstream scope 3, which may expose the sector to cost shifts as its core inputs are affected by the 
transition), and emissions from purchased electricity (scope 2 for electricity use, which could indirectly expose the sector 
to the effects of changes in the world’s energy mix).

37  See Paul Gargett, Stephen Hall, and Jayanti Kar, “Toward a net-zero future: Decarbonizing upstream oil and gas 

operations,” McKinsey & Company, December 2019.

the energy transition,” McKinsey & Company, March 2021.

31

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringlost in fossil fuel–based power. The build-out of power infrastructure and the capital spending 
associated with the net-zero transition could produce as many as 27 million direct jobs in the 
early years of the transition, and about 16 million direct jobs associated with construction 
and manufacturing activity in 2050. Asset stranding could be large. Our analysis suggests 
that about $2.1 trillion of the sector’s capital stock could be stranded by 2050 in the Net 
Zero 2050 scenario.39 Eighty percent of this amount is today’s capacity, while 20 percent is 
capacity that would be built between 2021 and 2050.40 

Mobility. Our analysis of mobility focuses on the road transportation segment, which 
accounts for about 75 percent of all mobility emissions.41 Decarbonization would involve 
replacing ICE vehicles with battery-electric vehicles or vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel 
cells. In the Net Zero 2050 scenario, annual spending would be $3.5 trillion on both vehicles 
and to build charging and fueling infrastructure between 2021 and 2050. About 13 million 
direct ICE-related jobs would be lost in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, although some of this 
loss would be offset by gains of about nine million direct jobs related to EV manufacturing by 
2050 with the difference between losses and gains driven in large part by the relatively higher 
productivity of zero-emissions vehicle manufacturing. 

Industry. We focus on two sectors, steel and cement, that together account for approximately 
14 percent of global CO₂ emissions and 47 percent of industry’s CO₂ emissions.42 While 
technology pathways are still emerging, steel and cement production could be decarbonized 
by installing CCS equipment or switching to processes or fuels—such as hydrogen—
that can have zero or low emissions. Production costs in both sectors could increase by 
more than 30 percent by 2050 compared with today, though this could be lower with 
continued innovation. 

Buildings. In the net-zero scenario, the buildings sector would decarbonize by improving 
energy efficiency—for example, through the use of insulation—and by replacing fossil 
fuel–powered heating and cooking equipment with low-emissions systems. The average 
annual spending on physical assets between 2020 and 2050 would be $1.7 trillion per year. 
Decarbonization of buildings could result in a net gain of about half a million direct jobs by 
2050 under a net-zero transition, driven by retrofitting buildings with insulation. The buildings 
sector’s biggest adjustment during this transition would be managing the up-front capital 
costs for end consumers to retrofit equipment and aligning incentives across various 
stakeholders (such as building owners who invest capital and tenants who may see the 
benefits of reduced operating costs).43

Agriculture and food. In the net-zero scenario analyzed here, agricultural emissions would 
be reduced as a result of producers deploying GHG-efficient farming practices, and some 
consumers shifting their diets away from ruminant animals that generate significant 
quantities of methane.44 The scenario would also entail an increase in production of 

39  Our definition of stranded assets represents the cumulative value of prematurely retired and underutilized assets in 

2020–50, undiscounted. We estimate it by first identifying the level of yearly depreciation that is expected given asset 
life and assumed economic life using data from the WRI Global Power Plant database as input. That figure was multiplied 
by the fraction of assets that are underutilized relative to past average utilization rates (between 2005 and 2020) and 
summed across years.

result in about 34 million direct jobs lost (predominately due to diminished production of 
ruminant meat) and 61 million gained (related in large part to increased production of energy 
crops and poultry) by 2050. This net gain of about 27 million direct jobs due to the transition 
is about 4 percent of the 720 million or so direct agriculture jobs today. These job shifts need 
to be considered against a long-standing trend in the agricultural sector of workers shifting 
to nonfarm work in addition to productivity, population, and income growth. Through 2050, 
more than $60 billion of annual capital spending would be needed to enable more emissions-
efficient farming. Such investment need not all be new funds; repurposing existing subsidies 
and spending could cover a substantial amount of this cost.45 

Forestry and other land use. This system contributes to an increase in CO₂ emissions today 
from land clearing and deforestation. Reaching net zero in this scenario would involve halting 
deforestation and accelerating efforts to restore forests and other natural environments to 
serve as a net sink of emissions. Making these changes would require capital spending of 
$40 billion per year between 2021 and 2050 in the scenario analyzed here, about 75 percent 
of which would be spent in the next decade, primarily on acquiring and protecting land. 
Reducing deforestation would also require managing adjustments to both commercial 
and subsistence-level farming activity (a substantial portion of deforestation is driven by 
expansion of agricultural land).46 Opportunities for economic gain might come from voluntary 
carbon markets and industries based on ecosystem services.47 

New energy sectors (hydrogen and biofuels). The expansion of low-emissions energy 
technologies will create opportunities. Expanding capacity and infrastructure for other low-
carbon fuels would require additional capital spending of about $230 billion per year between 
2021 and 2050, in the scenario analyzed here. We estimate that the hydrogen and biofuel 
sectors would create approximately two million direct jobs by 2050.

The transition would unevenly 
affect lower-income and fossil fuel 
resource–producing countries—and 
low-income consumers everywhere

Our in-depth analysis of 69 countries focuses on four areas that can collectively help define 
a climate agenda: decarbonization actions and investment; managing transition exposures; 
capturing transition opportunities; and addressing physical risks. As discussed previously, 
low-income households across countries and regions would be most affected by a net-zero 
transition. Moreover, our analysis suggests that while all countries face some exposure to the 
transition, its effects would be unevenly distributed. Regions with lower GDP per capita and 
those with greater fossil fuel resources would need to invest more, relative to GDP, to reduce 
their emissions, build a low-emissions economy, and support economic development.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringThese countries also have relatively greater shares of their jobs, GDP, and capital stock in 
sectors that would be most exposed to the transition. And some of them will face a double 
burden—being exposed both to the transition adjustments and to rising physical risks.48 
This could challenge progress on economic development goals in these regions, bolstering 
the case for global cooperation. At the same time, the transition could create potential for 
economic growth in many geographies. 

To better understand exposure and opportunities, we take a closer look at the 69 countries 
in our sample by dividing them into six archetypes based on the distribution of their most 
significant exposure across sectors and households.

To manage exposure, each country can consider taking actions of its own, such as investing 
in assets, funding worker-retraining programs, and supporting the growth of low-emissions 
sectors. Some countries are likely to face more difficult economic and societal adjustments 
than others. Collective action and solidarity would therefore help countries meet challenges 
and ensure that the economic and societal adjustments needed for the net-zero transition 
are addressed. Enabling institutions would likely play an essential role in coordinating any 
such efforts.

Developing countries and those with large fossil fuel sectors 
would likely spend more on physical assets, relative to GDP, on 
decarbonization and low-carbon growth

In the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, every country and region would spend to reduce 
emissions and develop low-emissions energy sources to power their economic growth.49 
The need for capital expenditures varies considerably across geographies given differences 
in their economies, and their decarbonization trajectories vary in the NGFS Net Zero 
2050 scenario. 

The world’s largest economies—the United States, China, the European Union, Japan, and the 
United Kingdom—would account for about half of global spend on physical assets and would 
spend about 6 percent of their combined GDP from 2021 to 2050. In developing regions, 
spend on energy and land would form a substantially larger share of national GDP: about 
10 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, India and some other Asian countries, and Latin America 
(Exhibit E10). 

For developing countries, higher projected rates of economic growth naturally create higher 
investment needs relative to GDP than in developed countries.50 In our analysis of the NGFS 
Current Policies scenario, spending in India, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America would 
total more than 9 percent of GDP. Spending would increase to some extent from these levels 
in the net-zero scenario analyzed here. For example, in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, India’s 
capital requirements would be 11 percent of GDP, compared to the global average of about 
7.5 percent of GDP. It would moreover be spent differently than in the Current Policies case. 
Some 60 percent of annual average investments in India would be on low-emissions assets 
under current policies compared to 80 percent in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. Much of 
that capital would be used to reduce the use of existing coal power and expand low-emissions 
electricity capacity. 

48  For example, India faces the double burden of transition exposure and elevated physical risks. Our previous research 
suggests that by 2030 in India, 160 million to 200 million people could be living in urban areas with a nonzero annual 
probability of experiencing a lethal heat wave, in a scenario where no adaptation or mitigation measures are implemented. 
Will India get too hot to work? McKinsey Global Institute, November 2020.

49  Our analysis looks at both individual countries and multicountry regions because the NGFS scenarios provide some 

decarbonization trajectories at the regional level and others at the national level.

50  Sub-Saharan Africa and India, for example, are expected to see real GDP growth of about 4–5 percent per year on 

average over the next 30 years, compared with 3 percent growth for China and 1–2 percent growth for developed regions 
in the NGFS scenario examined here.

1. Estimation includes spend for physical assets across various forms of energy supply (for example, power systems, hydrogen, and biofuel supply), energy demand (eg, 
for vehicles), and land use. This includes both what are typically considered “investments” in national accounts and spend, in some cases, on consumer durables such 
as personal cars. Scenario based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2). Based on analysis of systems that account for ~85% of 
overall carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) emissions today. Our analysis includes a more comprehensive view of spending by households and businesses on assets that 
use energy, capital expenditures in agriculture and forestry, and some continued spend in high-emissions physical assets like fossil fuel–based vehicles and power 
assets. For further details, see technical appendix. 

2. Our analysis divides high-emissions assets from low-emissions assets. High-emissions assets include assets for fossil fuel extraction and refining, as well as fossil fuel 
power production assets without CCS; fossil fuel heat production, gray-hydrogen production; steel BOF; cement fossil fuel kilns; ICE vehicles; fossil fuel heating and 
cooking equipment; dairy, monogastric, and ruminant meat production. Low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure include assets for blue-hydrogen production 
with CCS; green-hydrogen production using electricity and biomass; biofuel production; generation of wind, solar, hydro-, geothermal, biomass, gas with CCS, and 
nuclear power along with transmission and distribution and storage infrastructure; heat production from low-emissions sources such as biomass; steel furnaces using 
EAF, DRI with hydrogen, basic oxygen furnaces with CCS; cement kilns with biomass or fossil fuel kilns with CCS; low-emissions vehicles and supporting infrastructure; 
heating equipment for buildings run on electricity or biomass, including heat pumps; district heating connections; cooking technology not based on fossil fuels; building 
insulation; GHG-efficient farming practices; food crops, poultry and egg production; and land restoration. See technical appendix.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringFossil fuel–based economies would also have substantial spend on physical assets as a 
share of their GDP: above 15 percent in the Middle East and North Africa, Russia, Ukraine, 
and Commonwealth of Independent States such as Kazakhstan. Much of this spending 
would be continued spending on fossil fuel assets in the near term. However, even these 
economies would allocate half or more of their spending to low-emissions assets under a net-
zero transition.

While the relative scale of the spending on physical assets is substantially higher for 
developing and fossil fuel–based economies, this alone is not an indicator of how difficult it 
will be for these regions to reach a low-emissions economy. Indeed, as mentioned previously, 
much of this spend is to be expected as they grow their economies and increase energy 
access. However, specific aspects of their net-zero transition could make deploying capital 
challenging for these regions.

First, developing regions might face challenges in accessing capital markets. This may be 
particularly acute as they look to invest in low-emissions technologies, which may be harder 
to finance and come with different risk-return expectations. Second, as mentioned above, 
existing high-emissions assets in these economies are still relatively young; thus there may 
be less incentive to undertake low-carbon capital spending amid concerns about stranded 
assets. Third, there may not always be sufficient know-how and capacity on the ground to 
implement projects. Fourth, concerns of other socioeconomic consequences from a net-zero 
transition, for example, job dislocations, could exist. Finally, because the economies of these 
countries rely on emissions-intensive sectors, government tax revenues and public spending 
may be more constrained under a net-zero transition.51 

Developing countries and fossil fuel–producing regions have relatively 
large exposure to the transition, raising concerns about growth 
and inequality 

Beyond spending on decarbonizing their existing assets and building low-emissions assets, 
economies will also need to transform under a net-zero transition. We assessed each 
country’s exposure to the transition by measuring the proportion of employment, economic 
production, and physical capital stock in exposed sectors today. It is important to note 
that current efforts undertaken by countries could reduce this exposure going forward.52 
According to our analysis, all countries now have some exposure to the transition—and, as 
discussed earlier, low-income households everywhere would be most exposed to any cost 
increases that feed through to consumers.  

The highest levels of exposure are in countries with relatively lower GDP per capita, such as 
Bangladesh, India, and Kenya. These tend to be countries with relatively higher shares of 
jobs, GDP, and capital stock in sectors that are more exposed to the transition—which is to 
say, sectors with emissions-intensive operations, products, and supply chains (Exhibit E11). 
Significant fossil fuel resource production also creates high exposure for some countries, 
such as Qatar, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. Secondary effects from direct exposure could 
also extend to government tax revenues and exports, which are often linked with exposed 
sectors like fossil fuel extraction or steel (see Box E6, “Potential implications of the net-zero 
transition for trade flows”). By contrast, countries with higher GDP per capita tend to be less 
exposed because a majority of their economies are in service sectors, which have relatively 
lower exposure.

51  Similar conclusions were also reached by the IEA. See for example Financing clean energy transitions in emerging and 

developing economies, International Energy Agency, June 2021.

52  To gauge each national economy’s exposure to the transition, we calculated a score ranging from 0 (no exposure) to 100 
(full exposure). The score reflects the share of each economy’s employment (jobs), production activity (GDP), and capital 
stock in sectors that are most exposed to the effects of the transition—for example, sectors with high emissions in their 
operations, in the use of their products, or in their supply chains. For details, see chapter 4 and the technical appendix.

36

McKinsey & CompanyThus, for many lower-income and fossil fuel–producing countries, challenges associated 
with climate change could compound. These countries would need to balance multiple 
imperatives: decarbonizing their economies and funding associated capital expenditures, 
managing exposure of large parts of their economies to a net-zero transition, and enabling 
economic development and growth, particularly by expanding access to affordable, secure 
energy. And, as noted earlier, these challenges will be aggravated for some lower-income 
countries by heightened physical climate risk, such as the growing probability of lethal heat 
waves in parts of India.53 Inequity concerns would grow as an issue, particularly as developing 
economies argue that they have contributed less than others to emissions and yet are being 
asked to shoulder a large burden in the net-zero transition.

Potential implications of the net-zero transition for trade flows  

Value chains have grown in length and complexity in recent decades, and global trade has increased. Since 2000, the value 
of intermediate goods traded globally has tripled to more than $10 trillion annually.1 Increasing production of goods for export 
tends to increase a country’s own carbon emissions since most manufacturing still involves carbon-emitting processes or 
energy use. For example, other researchers have estimated that in some manufacturing sectors, such as chemicals, textiles, 
leather, and apparel, 30 to 65 percent of the emissions in China and India are induced by foreign final demand.2 Another way 
to think about this phenomenon is to regard exported goods as having their production emissions embedded or embodied in 
them. A look at the emissions that are embodied in goods traded across borders reveals that considerable quantities of CO₂ 
are, in effect, moved internationally every year (Exhibit E12). 

As demand for high-emissions goods falls and demand for low-emissions goods increases, trade flows might shift as 
countries’ comparative advantages change. For example, shifts in consumer preferences or the presence of carbon taxes 
or other regulatory measures could produce advantages for countries that make products with low emissions intensity. 
Countries could also pursue opportunities to meet growing overseas demand for new kinds of low-emissions goods or 
emerging decarbonization technologies. In some cases, decarbonization could raise production costs, which could make 
exports from countries that take decarbonization action less competitive. All of these factors could result in shifting trade 
patterns in sectors such as electric vehicles, solar panels, and minerals, and they would need to be systematically addressed. 

The outlook for global trade flows thus remains uncertain, and outcomes could depend on many factors, including how 
consumer preferences and regulation evolve and what opportunities different regions decide to pursue. In making strategic 
decisions, businesses may want to account for the ongoing discussion among countries of whether to implement border-
adjustment taxes that price carbon emissions into the value of traded goods and account for developments in broader 
regulation, consumer preferences, and evolving markets. In some cases, markets may well go from global to local; for example, 
global energy markets for oil and gas could transform to more local or regional markets for power or hydrogen. For some 
countries, the net-zero transition could also provide opportunities to grow domestic industries and reduce imports of 
commodities like fossil fuels.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringCountries can use natural endowments or technological, human, and 
physical resources to harness the transition’s growth potential 

All countries have opportunities to tap into the transition’s potential for growth and secure 
advantages, through their endowments of natural capital such as sunshine and wind and 
through the availability of technological, human, and physical capital.54

Countries could benefit from the transition if they possess rich stocks of natural capital such 
as ample sunlight and wind, forestland, mineral resources, and CO₂ sequestration potential 
(see Exhibit E13 for one example for solar and wind power potential, and chapter 4 for other 
examples). Generally speaking, many developing countries have the natural resources to 
accommodate solar power production and forestry protection or restoration efforts, which 
could be supported by flows of capital through mechanisms such as voluntary carbon 
markets. And most countries, developing or otherwise, have at least some of the natural-
capital endowments that would likely be in demand during the transition. For example, 
Australia and Saudi Arabia have extensive solar resources, Argentina and the United Kingdom 
have high wind power potential, and Chile and China have large reserves of minerals. 

Some countries have already gained strong positions in the markets for sophisticated low-
carbon goods, such as solar panels and EVs. Even so, these markets offer considerable 
growth potential, which should be accessible to countries with adequate technological 
capital. For example, South Korea has approximately 6,600 patents on technologies related 
to climate-change mitigation and human capital. Countries like China and Singapore have 
a high share of STEM graduates in the population, which provides an indication of the 
workforce’s technical skill. This in turn might be applied to developing solutions for the climate 
transition.  

A country’s physical capital, in the form of low-emissions infrastructure and industrial 
systems, could also create growth potential in a net-zero transition, for example, if consumers 
shift their preferences or carbon border taxes are applied. Even currently high-emissions 
infrastructure could be a benefit if it can readily be retrofitted, for example, with alternate low-
emissions fuel sources.

All countries have opportunities to 
tap into the transition’s potential 
for growth and secure advantages, 
through their endowments of natural 
capital such as sunshine and wind and 
through the availability of technological, 
human, and physical capital.

54  For a more detailed list of potential endowments countries can tap into and data on the same, see chapter 4.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringWe identify six main archetypes of countries, based on the common 
nature of their transition exposure

To help illustrate how the net-zero transition might play out differentially across the globe, 
we have defined six archetypes of countries according to the nature and magnitude of 
their exposure across sectors and households. We use sector exposure to define country 
archetypes as a way to highlight the distinct economic and societal adjustments that 
countries may need to make under a net-zero transition, while noting that countries will face 
myriad specific issues that are not reducible to a single archetype. In each case, we also 
describe endowments that countries possess to help them capture transition opportunities, 
as well as their exposure to physical risks, where relevant. (See Exhibit E14 for the archetypes 
based on transition exposure and chapter 4 for further detail related to opportunities for 
countries to benefit from the transition and their physical risk exposure.)55 

The following are the six archetypes:

Fossil fuel resource producers. Countries in this category include Australia, Bahrain, 
Canada, Egypt, Kuwait, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab 
Emirates, and Venezuela. Fossil fuel resource–producing sectors account for a significant 
portion of GDP in these countries, ranging from 3 percent in Australia to 39 percent in Kuwait, 
and a large share of physical capital—an average of about 15 percent compared to 2 percent 
in the rest of the countries. The magnitude of exposure varies among countries in this 
grouping. For example, Saudi Arabia has about 25 percent of its GDP in fossil fuel–producing 
sectors, and Qatar has about one-third of its GDP and its capital stock in those sectors. 
That compares with about 3 percent of GDP and 13 percent of capital stock in Australia. 

For the countries with higher shares in particular, various challenges could exist: the potential 
loss of government revenues from exposed sectors, the reallocation of capital spending from 
high- to low-emissions assets, and the potential need to diversify their economies. Many 
countries could also experience rising physical risks; countries in this grouping that are near 
the equator will become hotter and more humid as warming increases. At the same time, a 
net-zero transition offers opportunities that these countries can tap into, though capturing 
them and sufficiently compensating for loss in revenues and exports could also come 
with challenges. They generally have high solar power or wind power potential, which they 
could use to develop capacity for renewable-energy generation and make green hydrogen. 
Some fossil fuel producers, for example those in the Middle East, also have relatively low 
levels of carbon intensity associated with their oil and gas extraction and have relatively 
lower costs; thus, they could be the last standing providers of the remaining fossil fuels 
needed in a net-zero economy, in the scenario modeled here. 

Emissions-intensive producers. Countries in this category include Bangladesh, China, India, 
Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam. These countries 
derive sizable portions of their GDP, about 18 percent on average, from highly exposed 
sectors such as high-emissions manufacturing, fossil fuel–based power, and agriculture. 
Jobs tend to be concentrated in agriculture (more than 20 percent), while much of their capital 
stock is in manufacturing and fossil fuel–based power. These countries would likely adjust 
to the transition mainly by decarbonizing industrial processes, expanding renewable-power 
capacity, and helping farmers adopt low-carbon practices or transition away from agriculture. 
As discussed above, many of these countries will need to make substantial investment to 
decarbonize their economies and secure low-carbon growth. Our analysis suggests that 
these countries face a particular risk of asset stranding. Capital stock in these countries (coal-
fired power plants, for example) is often newer than in advanced economies. The average 
age of coal power plants in China and India is less than 15 years, compared with more than 
30 in the United States.56 Lower-income countries may also find that some low-carbon 
technologies (for example, electric-arc furnaces for steel production and CCS equipment for 
steel or cement factories) remain too expensive to deploy or, in some cases, unready for large-
scale deployment.

42

McKinsey & CompanyWithout careful planning, however, they run the risk that continued spending on lower-cost, 
high-emissions assets could result in the need to prematurely retire or reduce utilization of 
these assets after only a few years as the world transitions to a net-zero path. At the same 
time, these countries will have potential to serve the growing markets for low-emissions 
goods. Asian countries—many of which are included in this archetype—more broadly possess 
resources that could be conducive to low-emissions innovation.57 Capital spending for the 
transition would need to be complemented by investment in adaptation measures, since many 
countries in this archetype would become hotter, more humid, and more prone to flooding as 
warming increases.

Agriculture-based economies. Countries in this group include Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, 
the Philippines, Senegal, and Sri Lanka. Agriculture is the primary source of employment 
and income for a large share of the population in these countries, accounting for up to about 
55 percent of jobs and up to about 30 percent of GDP. An important adjustment for these 
countries will be adopting low-emissions farming practices, which would require mobilizing 
millions of stakeholders. As discussed above, many of these countries are expected to 
invest substantially in new assets as they grow their economies, particularly related to the 
power sector; securing financing would thus be a key priority under a net-zero transition. 
These countries also have significant potential to produce solar power and use forestland 
to generate carbon credits.58 Almost all of these countries are exposed to physical climate 
risk because rising heat and humidity affect their agricultural workforces, and also increase 
volatility of agricultural yields. 

Land-use-intensive countries. This group includes Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Malaysia, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay.59 In these 
countries, which have generally reached the early or middle stages of industrialization, the 
agriculture and forestry sectors together represent significant shares of GDP (more than 
5 percent), jobs (more than 10 percent), and capital stock (more than 5 percent). They would 
have to balance land-use needs with protection of forests and would have to support 
communities whose livelihoods depend on them. The contribution of other sectors such as 
fossil fuel production, power, and industry to GDP, jobs, and capital stock is also sizable for 
some countries in the archetype, like Brazil, which could also therefore be exposed to issues 
described for other archetypes. With their stocks of natural capital, these countries would 
have growth potential in sectors such as renewable energy, minerals needed for the transition, 
and forest management; reforestation and afforestation projects could generate valuable 
carbon credits and ecosystem services.

Downstream-emissions manufacturers. Countries in this group include Austria, Bulgaria, 
Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South 
Korea, and Sweden. The main exposure for these middle-to-high-income countries relates 
to the manufacturing of goods, such as automobiles and industrial machinery, that could 
experience falling demand in their current form because they use fossil fuel–based energy. 
Countries in this category could manage their exposure to shifts in demand for these products 
by reinventing products and supply chains. Many make large investments in R&D, which 
position them well to develop and commercialize low-emissions technologies.

59  As described above, countries could fall into multiple archetypes. A large share of the economy of Brazil, for example, is 

related to fossil fuels, and would also be exposed to the types of issues described for that archetype.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Services-based economies. Countries in this group include Belgium, Denmark, Finland, 
France, Greece, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, 
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries have high GDP 
per capita and derive most of their economic output from service sectors, so their overall 
exposure to net-zero transition adjustments is low. However, in certain regions and sectors, 
exposure could be high. These countries also tend to have high consumer emissions—1.6 tons 
per capita on average, compared to 0.9 tons per capita on average for other countries—and 
will therefore need to induce behavioral changes in their populations and incur up-front 
capital costs in order to decarbonize (although, as discussed previously, this could come with 
long-term benefits, such as lower total cost of ownership). These countries could use their 
ample natural, technological, and human capital to develop new low-emissions industries or 
provide services, such as financial or information services, in support of the transition. 

Challenges could compound for 
many lower-income and fossil fuel–
producing countries, which would 
need to balance multiple imperatives.

Stakeholders will need to act 
with singular unity, resolve, and 
ingenuity, and toward equitable, 
long-term outcomes to support 
the economic transformation a 
net-zero transition entails 

The transition to net zero we have outlined in this report will require economies and societies 
to make significant adjustments. Many of these adjustments can be best supported through 
coordinated action involving governments, businesses, and enabling institutions, and 
by extending planning and investment horizons. This action would need to be taken in a 
spirit of unity for two key reasons: first, the universal nature of the transition means that all 
stakeholders will need to play a role. Every country and sector contributes to emissions, 
either directly or indirectly, through its role in global production and consumption systems. 
Second, the burdens of the transition will not be evenly felt, and, for some stakeholders, 
the costs will be much more difficult to bear than for others. This is all the more challenging 
because contributions to emissions have not been even across stakeholder groups. 
Thus, without a real effort to address these effects in a spirit of fairness, it appears unlikely 
that the most affected stakeholders would be either able or willing to do their share to 
advance the transition.

46

McKinsey & CompanyThe following three categories of action stand out:60  

 — Catalyzing effective capital reallocation and new financing structures, including through 
scaling up climate finance, developing new financial instruments and markets, including 
voluntary carbon markets, deploying collaborations across the public and private sectors, 
and managing risk to stranded assets 

 — Managing demand shifts and near-term unit cost increases for sectors through building 

awareness and transparency around climate risks and opportunities, lowering technology 
costs with R&D, nurturing industrial ecosystems, collaboration across value chains to 
reduce or pass through cost increases from the transition, and sending the right demand 
signals and creating incentives for the transition 

 — Establishing compensating mechanisms to address socioeconomic impacts, through 

economic diversification programs, reskilling and redeployment programs for affected 
workers, and social support schemes

As these actions are undertaken, individual leaders will need to both consider risks and 
opportunities to their organizations and to their stakeholders, and determine the role they can 
play in supporting the necessary adjustments for all. We consider more detailed actions and 
the role of stakeholders below.

Companies can consider integrating climate considerations into their strategies and their 
decision-making frameworks. Companies have begun to develop comprehensive plans for 
achieving net-zero emissions and to integrate those plans into their strategies, combining 
elements of what might be called “offense” (such as entering new markets, funding R&D, and 
participating in innovation ecosystems) and “defense” (divesting businesses and retrofitting 
high-emissions assets to lower their emissions).61 As they embark on this journey, they can 
consider the following steps:

 —  Articulate and communicate a coherent case for change and upskill employees to help 
drive their organizations toward net-zero goals while also supporting broader economic 
and societal adjustments. As they initiate action, most CEOs will want to communicate a 
coherent case for change and take visible ownership of the sustainability agenda.

 —  Develop ongoing capabilities to make granular, holistic, and dynamic assessments of 

transition-related risks and opportunities in order to capture shifts in regulations, investor 
preferences, consumer behaviors, and competition. To stay abreast of new developments 
and emerging possibilities, organizations are likely to need new capabilities, data, 
infrastructure, and talent. A key part of this will also be better tracking of scope 1, 2, 
and 3 emissions, including through the use of digital tools to increase transparency of 
emissions in companies’ own operations and in their supply chains.

60  The actions described in this section specifically relate to the economic and societal adjustments needed for the 

transition, given the scope of this research. An effective response to climate change, we believe, will involve not only 
making economic and societal adjustments to deal with the effects of the net-zero transition, but also meeting the other 
fundamental requirements described previously. We identify seven categories of actions. Leaders can understand and 
commit to the transition, including understanding the fundamentals of climate science and the transition and making 
personal and professional commitments; assess and plan their actions, including through building risk assessment 
capabilities and establishing decarbonization plans; reduce and remove emissions in accordance with these plans; 
conserve and regenerate natural capital to support decarbonization; adapt and build resilience to manage the physical 
risk that is already locked in; and reconfigure and grow, for example by reallocating capital and ramping down high-carbon 
businesses while scaling low-carbon ones; and seek to engage and influence their communities, across their investors, 
customers, suppliers, peers, and regulators. While the actions described in this section are specific to the economic and 
societal adjustments needed for the transition, they fall into the various categories listed above. See Mekala Krishnan, 
Tomas Nauclér, Daniel Pacthod, Dickon Pinner, Hamid Samandari, Sven Smit, and Humayun Tai. “Solving the net-zero 
equation: Nine requirements for a more orderly transition,” McKinsey & Company, October 2021.

April 22, 2021.

47

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring 
 — Define decarbonization and offsetting plans and update them as competitive, financial, 
and regulatory conditions change. This would include scope 1 and 2 emissions (with 
priority given to “no regret” actions such as improving energy efficiency and making 
decarbonization investment with positive returns). Where feasible, needed, and material, 
and depending on the nature of their operations, businesses can expand these plans to 
include scope 3 emissions.62 

 —  Create a portfolio of agile business strategies consistent with these decarbonization 

plans and with the risks and opportunities emerging in a net-zero economy. They can then 
put these plans in place as conditions change and opportunities arise. For companies, 
repositioning themselves could involve investing in new physical assets and reallocating 
capital, redesigning products, or building new low-emissions businesses. 

 — Integrate climate-related factors into key business decisions for strategy, risk 

management, finance and capital planning, R&D, operations (including supplier 
management and procurement), organizational structure and talent management, pricing, 
marketing, and investor and government relations.

 — Consider if and where to take a leadership position in the company’s industry and its 

ecosystem of investors, supply chains, customers, and regulators. 

Financial institutions can support large-scale capital reallocation, even as they manage 
their individual risks and opportunities. In the near term, they will need to consider assessing 
and disclosing their risks and measuring and committing to reduce their financed emissions. 
Over time, they will need to translate these commitments into actions that lower emissions. 
Relevant practices for financial institutions to consider include the following: 

 — Rethinking conventions for risks and returns. Some decarbonization projects are likely 
to have longer-than-normal payback periods. This possibility may compel financial 
institutions to adjust their criteria for which projects they finance. 

 — Assessing and disclosing climate risks. For example, various regulators and supervisors 
already require banks to conduct climate-risk assessments, and more are planning to 
start these assessments. 

 — Measuring and reducing financed emissions. Financial institutions are increasingly 

making pledges to align their portfolios with 1.5°C or 2.0°C warming targets or to achieve 
net-zero financed emissions by a certain date. They have started translating these 
commitments into targets for sectors and geographies. Given that emissions ultimately 
are from counterparties, financial institutions may find it helpful to support the transition 
plans of those counterparties—for instance, by offering new financial solutions, advising 
them on emissions-abatement methods, and introducing partnership opportunities.

 — Over time, translating these commitments into actions that lower emissions, including 

expanding the range of climate-finance products and services (for example, funding for 
low-emissions power projects, new financial instruments to support negative emissions or 
nature-based solutions, and well-governed voluntary carbon markets).63

62  For purposes of this report, “scope 1” emissions are direct greenhouse emissions that occur from sources that are 
controlled or owned by an organization; “scope 2” emissions are associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, 
heat, or cooling. “Scope 3” emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting 
organization but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain; thus “scope 3” emissions result from emissions 
across an organization’s value chain that are not within the organization’s scope 1 and 2 boundary. See Greenhouse gases 
at EPA, United States Environmental Protection Agency.

63  Voluntary carbon markets would include markets for avoidance credits (for example, to prevent forests from being cut 

down) and for removal credits (for example, from afforestation or direct air capture). For further details, see Final report, 
Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, January 2021.

48

McKinsey & CompanyGovernments and multilateral institutions could consider the use of existing and new 
policy, fiscal, and regulatory tools to establish incentives, support vulnerable stakeholders, 
and foster collective action. Public-sector organizations have a unique role in managing 
uneven effects on sectors and communities. Among other options, they could consider 
the following: 

 — Assess exposure to risks and opportunities, develop decarbonization plans, and 

create net-zero strategies (similar to businesses). This would include governments 
bringing climate considerations into decisions about such matters as urban planning, 
infrastructure development, and tax and subsidy regimes in an effort to anticipate future 
dynamics, as well as efforts to increase awareness of and transparency about climate 
risks and opportunities. One major adjustment that governments may need to make is 
developing new low-emissions industries as demand wanes for fossil fuels and emissions-
intensive industries. 

 — Use policy measures and regulation to encourage decarbonization investment across 
sectors (for example, consider where and how to best use subsidies, grants, demand 
signals, and carbon taxes, to name a few). They can also play a role in accelerating 
research and development that would lower technology costs.

 — Governments could establish multilateral and government funds to support low-carbon 

investment, and manage stranded-asset risk. 

 — Institute reskilling, redeployment, and social-support programs for workers and manage 

negative effects on lower-income households. 

 — Collaborate with other stakeholders to drive collective action. For example, governments 
can catalyze private-sector action to build new low-emissions industries in various ways; 
strategies might include setting road maps and convening stakeholders. 

Enabling institutions such as standard setters, industry groups, and civil-society coalitions 
will be critical in coordinating action across sectors and geographies. Although individual 
actions by companies and governments can support a wide range of stakeholders during 
the transition, these actions may not be enough to meet all stakeholder needs. The pace and 
scale of the transition mean that many of today’s institutions may need to be revamped, and 
new institutions created to disseminate knowledge, support capital deployment, manage 
uneven effects, and organize collective action. Enabling institutions could play valuable 
roles in developing and enforcing governing standards, tracking and market mechanisms 
(for example, related to the measurement of emissions or climate finance), convening 
stakeholders and facilitating collaboration (for example, to arrange collective investment 
or organize the build-out of infrastructure), and giving a voice to vulnerable workers 
and communities. 

As they initiate action, most CEOs will 
want to communicate a coherent case 
for change and take visible ownership 
of the sustainability agenda.

49

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringIndividuals will need to manage their own exposure to the transition and can play powerful 
roles as consumers and citizens. They can begin by continuing to learn about the effects 
of both ongoing climate change and the net-zero transition that they may experience as 
consumers or workers. The goal of net-zero emissions can only be reached if people adopt 
new behaviors and consumption patterns, such as switching to electric vehicles, and 
renovating or retrofitting homes for energy efficiency. Civic discourse has an important 
role to play: an informed, engaged public that recognizes the imperative for a net-zero 
transition could spur decisive and transformative action on the part of government and 
business leaders. 

The economic transformation required to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 will be massive 
in scale and complex in execution. The transition would bring substantial shifts in demand, 
capital allocation, costs, and jobs, which will be challenging to a wide range of stakeholders, 
not least because they will be distributed unevenly. Yet the costs and dislocations that 
would result from a more disorderly transition to net-zero emissions would likely be far 
greater, and the transition would prevent the further buildup of physical risks. The findings 
of this research serve as a clear call for more thoughtful and decisive action, taken with the 
utmost urgency, to secure a more orderly transition to net zero by 2050. It is important not 
to view the transition as only onerous; the required economic transformation will not only 
create immediate economic opportunities but also open up the prospect of a fundamentally 
transformed global economy with lower energy costs, and numerous other benefits—for 
example, improved health outcomes and enhanced conservation of natural capital. Actions 
by individual companies and governments, along with coordinated action to support more 
vulnerable sectors, geographies, and communities, could help support the needed economic 
and societal adjustments. Moreover, the level of global cooperation that such a transition will 
ultimately require could serve as both a model and a basis for solving a broader array of global 
challenges. Daunting as the task may seem, it is fair to assume that human ingenuity would 
ultimately rise to the challenge of achieving net zero, just as it has solved other seemingly 
intractable problems over the past 10,000 years. The key issue is whether the world can 
muster the requisite boldness and resolve to broaden its response during the upcoming 
decade, which will, in all likelihood, decide the nature of the transition. 

It is important not to view the transition 
as only onerous; the required economic 
transformation will not only create 
immediate economic opportunities 
but also open up the prospect of a 
fundamentally transformed global 
economy with lower energy costs, 
and numerous other benefits.

1. The net-zero 
challenge 

Governments, companies, and other institutions increasingly recognize that the physical 
risks associated with a changing climate will continue to build up until the world reduces 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and counterbalances any remaining emissions with 
equivalent removals of GHGs from the atmosphere.64 To do so will require decarbonizing six 
energy and land-use systems—power, industry, mobility, buildings, agriculture, and waste—
and restoring a seventh, forestry and other land use, that acts as both a source of and a 
natural sink for CO₂ and other greenhouse gases. 

Yet today, the net-zero equation is not solved and we are not on track to reach net zero and 
implement these changes in time to limit global warming to 1.5°C, in line with the highest 
objective of the 2015 Paris Agreement. As of December 2021, more than 70 countries 
accounting for more than 80 percent of global CO₂ emissions and about 90 percent of global 
GDP had put net-zero commitments in place, as had more than 5,000 companies as part 
of the United Nations’ Race to Zero campaign.65 Yet even if all the existing commitments 
were fulfilled, greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2050 would still likely exceed 
the potential budget of what scientists consider necessary to keep warming below 1.5°C.66 
Moreover, these commitments have yet to be translated into implementation plans. Execution 
would not be easy: it would require a careful balancing of the shorter-term risks of poorly 
prepared or uncoordinated action with the longer-term risks of insufficient or delayed action. 

Decarbonizing the energy and land-use systems will be possible only if nine system-level 
requirements are met, encompassing physical building blocks, economic and societal 
adjustments, and governance, institutions, and commitment.67 These requirements would 
need to be fulfilled against the backdrop of many economic (for example, inflation) and 
political challenges (for example, polarization within and among countries). This report 
focuses on the economic and societal adjustments needed for a net-zero transition. 
Specifically, we analyze the nature and magnitude of the transition’s likely socioeconomic 
consequences in four domains: demand, capital allocation, costs, and jobs. In this chapter, we 
outline the context for the net-zero challenge and the shifts that will be needed across energy 
and land-use systems.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringPhysical risks will continue 
to intensify until net-zero 
emissions are reached

The average combined global land-and-sea surface temperature of this past decade was 
about 1.1°C warmer than preindustrial temperatures, defined as the period between 1850 and 
1900.68 Earth is now warming at a rate of about 0.2°C per decade and losing Arctic sea ice at 
roughly 3,000 cubic kilometers per decade.69 Climate science tells us the main driver of this 
temperature increase is the human-caused rise in atmospheric levels of CO₂ and other GHGs, 
including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N₂O).70

As average temperatures rise, acute hazards such as heat waves and floods increase in 
frequency and severity, and chronic hazards, such as drought and rising sea levels, intensify. 
Most recently, the Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC AR6) reaffirmed that continued emissions of GHGs will cause acute 
and chronic climate events to increase in frequency, severity, or both.71 

The physical manifestations of a changing climate are increasingly visible across the globe, 
as are their socioeconomic impacts. Both will continue to grow, most likely in a nonlinear way, 
until the world transitions to a net-zero economy. Our 2020 report on climate risk explored 
physical climate risks and their socioeconomic impacts in detail.72 It found that physical 
climate risk is rising and could lead to nonlinear and systemic impacts on human livability and 
workability, food systems, physical capital, infrastructure, and natural capital.

As physical climate risk spreads, it could trigger broader economic, financial, and social 
disruptions.73 Estimates suggest that failing to limit the rise of GHG emissions could affect 
between 2 and 20 percent of global GDP by 2050 under a high-emissions (RCP 8.5) 
scenario.74 The wide range reflects the intrinsic difficulty in making these estimates.

emissions, not cumulative stock of emissions.” See “Summary for policymakers,” in Climate change 2021: The physical

McKinsey & CompanyThe effect of hard-to-predict biotic feedback loops (for example, the thawing of permafrost) 
or knock-on economic effects (for example, from impacts on financial valuations) could push 
losses well beyond the high-end estimate.75 It is also likely that some physical impacts (for 
example, sea-level rise caused by melting glaciers) will be irreversible over millennia if critical 
thresholds are reached. Prudent risk management thus calls for limiting GHG emissions.

To stabilize the climate and limit physical climate risks, climate science tells us that it is 
necessary to reduce the addition of GHGs to the atmosphere to net zero.76 And the less 
GHG that is emitted before the world reaches net zero, the less warming will take place. As 
a result of this relationship between cumulative emissions and global temperatures, Earth 
has a so-called carbon budget, a specific amount of CO₂ that can be emitted before it 
becomes probable that warming will exceed a certain level. The IPCC AR6 report estimated 
that restricting net emissions to 400–500 gigatons of carbon dioxide (GtCO₂), combined 
with substantial decreases in emissions of short-lived GHGs like methane, would result in a 
50 to 67 percent probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. Climate 
scientists have identified 1.5°C warming as a possible threshold above which feedback loops 
such as the melting of permafrost or collapse of ocean currents may be activated, causing 
abrupt changes to the planet and exacerbating or accelerating the effects of a changing 
climate. Restricting emissions to 1,150–1,350 GtCO₂ would result in a 50 to 66 percent 
probability of limiting warming to 2.0°C.77

However, time is running out to reach net-zero emissions in time to limit warming to these 
levels. Global CO₂ emissions are about 40 GtCO₂ today.78 Emissions of CO₂ have risen 
significantly since 1970, though the rate of growth has slowed in recent years, including a 
temporary reduction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Exhibit 1).79 Similarly, emissions 
of other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide have also been rising. Indeed, 
the importance of reducing emissions of these latter greenhouse gases in order to restrict 
warming to 1.5°C is increasingly being emphasized.80 At current emissions rates, the carbon 
budget for 1.5°C of warming would likely be exceeded within about the next decade, and the 
2.0°C budget would be exceeded in about three decades.

Given the cumulative nature of the problem and the relatively short window until carbon 
budgets are spent, action today is critical. Every year without significant progress makes the 
task more arduous and raises the risk that warming limits are reached.81 The decisions of the 
next decade are therefore crucial to preventing the worst effects of climate change. Climate 
science tells us that the Earth system will continue to change along the journey to net zero 
and that some changes will continue even after we have stopped the planet from warming. 
Given the thermal inertia of the Earth system, some physical impacts like sea level rise and 
ocean acidification will continue to intensify even once net zero is reached and warming has 
stopped. This suggests that societies will continue to need to take action to adapt (see Box 1, 
“The adaptation agenda”).82

The adaptation agenda  

Adaptation action is needed to manage a continually increasing level of physical risk, 
irrespective of the decarbonization measures required to achieve net-zero emissions.

Key adaptation measures that stakeholders can consider include the following: 

 — protecting people and assets through measures that include installing “gray” 

infrastructure such as elevation for buildings or sea walls, protecting or restoring 
“green” infrastructure such as coral reefs, or adjusting working hours to reduce 
exposure to extreme heat1

 — building resilience and backups in systems with actions like increasing global 

inventories and diversifying supply chains 

 — reducing exposure where necessary, for example by relocating assets from regions 
that are too difficult to protect, or thoughtful planning of where to build new assets 

 — ensuring appropriate financing and insurance to enhance resilience and manage risk 

In 2016, the UN Environment Programme identified adaptation costs of $140 billion 
to $300 billion per year for developing countries by 2030, rising to $280 billion to 
$500 billion annually by 2050. The Global Commission on Adaptation calculated 
necessary adaptation investment of $1.8 trillion between 2020 and 2030, equivalent 
to less than 1 percent of projected total gross fixed capital formation in that period, for 
a specific set of adaptation actions.2 The calculated investment includes strengthening 
early warning systems, hardening new infrastructure, improving dryland agriculture 
crop production, protecting mangroves, and making management of water resources 
more resilient.

There are many reasons why adaptation is challenging and will need to be carefully 
managed. The intensity of physical hazards is likely to grow, and so the cost of 
adaptation could increase over time, and there may eventually be technical or other 
limits to effective adaptation. Additionally, societies would have to assess trade-offs, 
including who and what to protect or relocate. Finally, adaptation costs are ultimately 
incurred at the local level, by individual countries, communities, or companies, and 
financing adaptation may be challenging for these stakeholders depending on specific 
economic conditions.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringNet-zero emissions can be 
achieved only through a 
universal transformation of 
energy and land-use systems 

Today, seven energy and land-use systems account for all GHG emissions, while one, 
forestry and other land use, also acts as a natural sink for carbon, which absorbs CO₂ from 
the atmosphere and is being depleted by deforestation. The vast majority of carbon dioxide 
emissions, as much as 83 percent, is energy related (Exhibit 2).83 

Carbon dioxide emissions in each case result from the combustion of fossil fuels to produce 
energy (oil, gas, and coal) as well as non-energy emissions—for example, emissions 
associated with industrial processes, like the reduction of iron ore to produce steel, and with 
deforestation. Combustion of coal makes up about 35 percent, oil an additional 31 percent, 
and gas 17 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.84

Actions to reach net-zero emissions include shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels and 
toward zero-emissions electricity and other low-emissions energy carriers such as hydrogen; 
adapting industrial and agricultural processes; increasing energy efficiency and managing 
demand for energy; utilizing the circular economy; consuming fewer emissions-intensive 
goods; deploying carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCS) technology; and enhancing 
sinks of both long-lived and short-lived greenhouse gases.85 Managing fugitive emissions is 
important for this last action, as are avoiding deforestation and enabling forest restoration. 
Recent McKinsey research on what it would take to achieve a 1.5°C pathway examined a range 
of scenarios and found that the above actions would need to be deployed across all sectors in 
the economy and would require emission-reduction efforts, beginning today.86

A key feature of any transition to net-zero emissions is its universality, across energy and 
land-use systems and throughout the global economy. This is for two reasons. First, each 
of these energy and land-use systems contributes substantially to emissions and will need 
to undergo transformation if the net-zero goal is to be achieved. Second, these systems are 
highly interdependent; actions to reduce emissions must therefore take place in concert and 
at scale across systems, economic sectors, and geographies. For instance, electric vehicles 
are valuable only to the extent that low-emissions electricity production has been achieved. 
All sectors of the economy participate in these energy and land-use systems across global 
value chains. Similarly, all countries contribute to emissions, either directly or through their 
role in value chains. Reaching net-zero emissions will thus require a transformation of the 
global economy. 

83  Notably, this is based on the current system of emissions measurement, in which forestry emissions in particular are 
considered as net emissions, considering their role as both sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. Considering just 
their role as gross sources of emissions, and accounting for second-order effects of deforestation, would substantially 
increase the contribution of forestry as sources of emissions. For further details, see chapter 3.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringFor each of the seven systems, sources of emissions and decarbonization actions are as 
follows (Exhibit 3, see also chapter 3 for further details): 

 —  Power. Generating electricity and heat through burning coal, natural gas, and—to a 

lesser extent—oil accounts for 30 percent of global CO₂ emissions (of which China and 
the United States produce nearly half) and 3 percent of N₂O emissions.87 Achieving 
zero-emissions electricity requires accelerating the replacement of fossil fuels in power 
generation with low-emissions sources, such as wind, solar, and nuclear. The growth 
of renewables like solar and wind raises the question of how to deal with their daily and 
seasonal intermittency and ensure reliability. Various options are typically considered for 
this. For example, some fossil fuel plants would likely remain in use to ensure flexibility 
of the grid, and their use would need to go hand-in-hand with storage technologies, the 
use of carbon capture, utilization, and storage and power-to-gas-to-power conversions, 
as well as demand management and long-distance interconnections to pool renewable 
assets across a larger geographic area88 (see Box 2, “The role of carbon capture and 
negative emissions”). Another consideration would be managing the physical footprint of 
renewable technologies, which is much higher than that of traditional fossil fuels.89 Scaling 
the power sector and producing zero-emissions electricity can also be a key part of 
helping other sectors reduce emissions.

 —  Industry. Industry accounts for about 30 percent of global CO₂ emissions, 33 percent of 
methane emissions, and 8 percent of N₂O emissions, from various industrial processes 
such as the production of steel, cement, and chemicals, and extraction and refining 
of oil, gas, and coal.90 Emissions result from burning fossil fuels for energy, from the 
production process itself, and from fugitive emissions from extraction, refining, and 
transportation of fossil fuels. Decarbonizing industry emissions would require a shift to 
processes and plants that are more energy efficient, using alternate fuels and inputs 
such as green hydrogen, and scaling carbon capture, utilization, and storage for hard-to-
abate emissions, to name a few decarbonization actions.91 Some of these technologies 
are in relatively early stages and further efforts will be needed to scale them and drive 
down costs.

 —  Mobility. Road, aviation, rail, maritime, and other forms of transportation contribute 
approximately 19 percent of global CO₂ emissions annually, with the United States 
producing nearly one-quarter of that total, and 2 percent of N₂O emissions.92 The primary 
decarbonization lever is replacing internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with battery-
electric vehicles (BEVs) and vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells (fuel cell electric 
vehicles, or FCEVs), supported by the expansion of corresponding infrastructure: electric 
charging stations for BEVs and hydrogen fueling stations for FCEVs, plus upstream 
production of low-emissions electricity and hydrogen. These low-emissions technologies 
could be used for passenger vehicles such as cars, buses, and two- and three-wheelers, 
as well as road freight. Aviation could reduce emissions through a mixture of shifting 
short-haul trips from air to rail, retiring older aircraft, retrofitting existing fleets with 
energy-efficient features, and increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), 
to name a few decarbonization routes. Reducing emissions in marine shipping could 
involve slower growth in tanker demand as oil usage decreases, improvements in fuel

Tai, “A 2040 vision for the US power industry: Evaluating two decarbonization scenarios,” McKinsey & Company, February 
2020.

89  Current power technologies such as coal and gas require about 12 acres per megawatt of power generation. In contrast, 
solar and wind power require approximately 43 and 71 acres of land per megawatt, respectively. Thus, switching to wind 
and solar power would likely increase land use by a factor of three to six. See The footprint of energy and land use of US 
electricity production, Strata, 2017.

fuels, such as ammonia.93 Additional effort for aviation and shipping is needed to lower 
costs, improve the supply chain, and ensure availability of reliable feedstock.

 —  Buildings. Heating and cooking in buildings contribute about 6 percent of global 
CO₂ emissions, of which residential buildings account for the majority.94 The key 
decarbonization levers here are enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings and 
appliances (for example, via making appliances more efficient and upgrading buildings’ 
insulation and airflow) and replacing appliances and heating systems that run on fossil 
fuels with models that run on low- or zero-emissions energy sources (for example, 
replacing gas or oil boilers with electric heat pumps, replacing gas stoves and ovens with 
electric models, and building out infrastructure such as district heating systems that can 
run on renewable sources and municipal hydrogen networks).

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring —  Agriculture. Direct on-farm energy use and emissions from agricultural practices and 
fishing are responsible for approximately 1 percent of global CO₂ emissions, 38 percent 
of global methane emissions, and 79 percent of global N₂O emissions.95 Decarbonizing 
agriculture would occur through shifting farming practices toward lower-emissions 
practices and technologies, such as making changes in animal feeding and breeding 
practices, improving fertilization practices, and adopting zero-emissions machinery, and 
through shifting diets that are currently high in protein from ruminant animals toward more 
plant-based foods or lower-emissions animal protein sources such as poultry, as well as 
reducing food waste by improving supply chains and changing consumer behavior.96 Any 
such diet shifts would need to be balanced with nutritional imperatives: in some parts of 
the world, raising protein consumption—including through the use of ruminant-based 
protein sources—is vital to improving health outcomes for the population.97 

 —  Forestry and other land use. Forestry and other land use accounts for nearly 14 percent 

of annual CO₂ emissions, 5 percent of global methane emissions, and 5 percent of 
global N₂O emissions.98 Forestry contributes to emissions through CO₂ released into the 
atmosphere from land cover change (for instance, from slash-and-burn deforestation, 
the decomposition of felled trees, soil disturbance, and forest degradation, as well as the 
loss of carbon-sequestration capacity), and the release of carbon stored in soil from land 
cover change. Currently, ten million hectares of land are deforested every year.99 Forests 
play a crucial role in decarbonization as natural carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide 
and releasing oxygen to contribute to negative emissions. Although measuring the effects 
of deforestation is challenging, and trees absorb CO₂ at widely varying rates (depending 
on species, location, and the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere), estimates suggest 
that over a 30-year period, a tree can store an additional 60 to 85 percent as much carbon 
as is released when the tree is cut down or burned, and that overall emissions could be 
even higher considering uncertainties around secondary emissions and forgone carbon 
sequestration resulting from deforestation.100 The only ways to lessen these effects are to 
reduce rates of deforestation, replant destroyed forests, and afforest new areas.101 

 —  Waste. Solid waste disposal and treatment, incineration, and wastewater treatment 

contribute to 23 percent of methane emissions and 3 percent of N₂O emissions.102 Actions 
to reduce waste emissions include diverting more recyclable materials and organic waste 
from landfills, investing in anerobic digestors and composters, and implementing on-site 
methane capture.

agricultural or urban land use. See The state of the world’s forests 2020: Forests, biodiversity, and people, FAO, 2020.

100 Research indicates that forgone carbon sequestration and forest degradation are highly underestimated in current 

evaluations of deforestation emissions. Estimates are associated with large uncertainties including lack of data (especially 
on secondary effects) and variations in carbon sequestration due to tree species, location, and concentration of CO₂ in 
the atmosphere. Overall, secondary emissions and forgone carbon sequestration resulting from deforestation could be 
up to three to nine times higher than direct emissions alone. See Sean Maxwell et al., “Degradation and forgone removals 
increase the carbon impact of intact forest loss by 626%,” Science Advances, volume 5, issue 10, October 2019. For

McKinsey & CompanyAll countries contribute to global emissions, but in general, the emissions of individual nations 
tend to vary in correlation with GDP and population. Overall, the top 10 emitters account for 
about 60 percent of global CO₂ emissions (Exhibit 4). The top three are China (approximately 
26 percent), the United States (approximately 12 percent), and India (approximately 
6 percent).103  

These large emitters have very different profiles due to the structures of their economies. 
China’s emissions derive principally from industry (approximately 12 percent of global CO₂ 
emissions) and power (approximately 11 percent), reflecting its emergence as a key global 
manufacturing hub in the past two decades. Similarly, India ranks third largely because of 
emissions from power generation (approximately 3 percent of global CO₂ emissions) and 
heavy-emitting industry processes (approximately 2 percent). By contrast, US emissions 
come to a greater extent from power (approximately 4 percent) and consumption of fossil fuels 
in road transportation (approximately 3 percent). Among other top emitters, Russia’s position 
reflects the key role of oil and gas in the country’s economy, and Japan’s profile indicates the 
role of power generation and industry. 

This profile looks somewhat different when considering cumulative historical emissions. 
In that respect, the United States is the largest emitter: it accounted for 417 GtCO₂ between 
1800 and 2020, or 25 percent of global cumulative historical CO₂ emissions. China is 
next, with 14 percent of global cumulative historical CO₂ emissions, but the gap is closing. 
Russia ranks third with 7 percent of global cumulative historical CO₂ emissions, followed 
by Germany (5 percent), the United Kingdom (5 percent), and Japan (4 percent). India, the 
third-largest contributor today, ranks seventh historically because its emissions are mostly 
recent (45 percent of India’s cumulative historical emissions have happened since 2010). 
The top ten largest historical emitters account for 68 percent of global cumulative historical 
CO₂ emissions.104

Achieving net-zero emissions will 
require addressing nine interrelated, 
system-level requirements 

Achieving net zero is, in its essence, solving an equation that balances sources and sinks of 
emissions by reducing GHG emissions as much as possible while increasing GHG stores to 
remove any remaining emissions from the atmosphere.105 This is what we refer to as the net-
zero equation. In reality, it is not a single equation but a system of equations. The emissions 
equation is coupled with a capital and a labor equation; demand for capital and labor in a net-
zero economy must match supply, over time and across regions. And these equations must be 
solved simultaneously while pursuing economic development and inclusive growth. 

At present, though, the net-zero equation cannot be solved: emissions remain high and are 
not counterbalanced by removals. What’s more, the world is not on pace to complete the 
net-zero transition and limit warming to 1.5°C. Based on policies currently enacted into law, 
UNEP, Climate Action Tracker, and the IEA project that warming will be 2.6–2.7°C by 2100. 
In alternate scenarios, in which current long-term net-zero targets and interim 2030 pledges 
are fully implemented, these organizations project that warming would be restricted between 
2.1 and 2.2°C. IEA lowers this estimate to 1.8°C if net-zero targets still under discussion were 
also fully implemented.106

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringBox 2

The role of carbon capture and negative emissions  

Keeping warming to 1.5°C will likely require pursuing steep reductions in gross emissions at 
the same time as investing in carbon capture and negative-emission technologies that remove 
carbon from the atmosphere and store it over the long term.1 Promising technologies to capture 
and remove CO₂ from the atmosphere exist, though more effort will be needed to scale them and 
reduce their costs.

Emissions abatement via carbon capture, utilization, and storage.2 Carbon capture, 
utilization, and storage often refers to the engineered removal of CO₂, commonly via amine 
scrubbing, a chemical process that absorbs CO₂ from exhaust gases. This can be done to 
abate CO₂ directly at the source in the case of fossil-based power plants and industrial point 
sources such as steel, cement, and blue-hydrogen production. Alternatively, it can be used to 
create negative emissions, either by removing CO₂ from the stack of a bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS) facility, or by removing CO₂ from ambient air via direct air capture 
(DAC) (see further detail below on negative emissions).3 Captured CO₂ is either sequestered in 
sealed formations or utilized as an input for materials and goods that use recycled CO₂ such as 
plastics, building materials, and fuel. Approximately 40 commercial-scale CCS facilities exist 
globally today, which collectively abate about 40 million to 50 million tons of CO₂ per year (Mtpa).4 
Estimates for the annual abatement level required to achieve 1.5°C goals range from 5,000 to 
upwards of 10,000 Mtpa, more than 100 times current abatement capacity.5 Some promising 
but nascent markets such as CO₂-cured concrete, plastics, and synthetic fuels could potentially 
expand and contribute to abatement efforts if market economics improve. Most typical transition 
scenarios involve other types of abatement, for example increased use of renewables, for much 
of the mitigation need, but they project that CCS could play a role in reducing emissions in the 
hardest to abate sectors.6 It could also contribute to the gigatons of negative emissions required 
to stay on a 1.5°C pathway. Currently, per-tonne CO₂ capture costs can be as low as $10–40 for 
high-purity industrial point sources, $50–$100 for low-purity point sources like coal or cement, 
and more than $300 for direct air capture.7 Capturing CO₂ often represents the largest cost in 
the CCS value chain which also includes compression, transportation, storage, and utilization. 
Manufacturer willingness to pay for CO₂ as a material input varies widely across industries and 
may change over time as the CCS market matures.8 By 2030, smaller high-margin industries 
(for example, carbon fiber) may be willing to pay close to $250 per ton while larger industries 
comprising the majority of the CO₂ market (for example, cement and enhanced oil recovery) may 
require prices under $50 per ton, potentially below average future capture costs. 

However, it is possible that CCS could be used more extensively to extend the lifespan of current 
fossil fuel–based infrastructure while minimizing additional emissions, particularly if capture 
costs fall. Additionally, if the scale-up of renewables proves more disorderly than forecast, 
CCS may play an increasingly important role in decarbonizing the backup fossil-based energy 
generation needed to bridge any energy gaps.

industries. Additional transition-related and macroeconomic factors could affect not only the CCS market but overall industry

Negative emissions. A wide range of negative-emission solutions is available today at 
varying stages of deployment readiness. For example, natural climate solutions (NCSs) such 
as reforestation and coastal ecosystem restoration use biological mechanisms to remove 
CO₂ from the air and water. NCSs require minimal technological advancement and can be 
readily implemented today (though with potential land use constraints in some geographies). 
As described above, various engineered atmospheric carbon capture technologies that can 
be used to create negative emissions, specifically removing CO₂ from the stack of a BECCS 
facility, or from ambient air via DAC, are technologically feasible today but would require 
significant investment to drive sufficient economies of scale. BECCS creates negative 
emissions by capturing the CO₂ already sequestered in biomass-based fuels that would 
otherwise have been re-released into the atmosphere upon heating, while DAC removes 
CO₂ directly from the air and therefore does not require a specific point emissions source 
for implementation. More nascent technologies like direct ocean capture (DOC) involve 
either chemically or electrically capturing CO₂ directly from ocean water, in some instances 
producing both captured CO₂ and hydrogen as byproducts.9 DOC, while promising due to 
higher concentrations of CO₂ in water than in ambient air, is still under development.

Enabling significant mobilization of negative emissions and expanding the market for CO₂ 
will require collaborative efforts to define what constitutes a high-quality negative emission 
and to shape a market for trading negative-emission credits, as well as possible regulatory 
intervention to encourage their purchase and the use of CO₂ more broadly as a material 
feedstock. If these criteria are met, some estimates suggest NCS, BECCS, and DAC could 
collectively deliver eight to 12 gigatons of negative emissions per year by 2050.10

McKinsey & CompanyTo address the challenges inherent in solving the net-zero equation would require coordinated 
action by companies and countries to fulfill nine fundamental, interrelated system-level 
requirements—none of which has been fully met so far.107 These can be grouped into three 
categories, as follows: 

 —  Physical building blocks, encompassing (1) technological innovation; (2) ability to create 
at-scale supply chains and support infrastructure; and (3) availability of necessary 
natural resources. Past McKinsey research suggests that there is a line of sight to the 
technologies needed to limit warming to 1.5ºC above preindustrial levels, although 
continued innovation is still needed. McKinsey research on decarbonization in Europe, 
for example, suggests that more than 85 percent of the emissions abatement needed to 
achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 could come from technologies already demonstrated, 
including 28 percent that are now mature and 32 percent that are in an early phase of 
adoption.108 Further innovation, both to develop new technologies that can be deployed 
at scale and to reduce their costs, is still needed, particularly related to various hard-
to-abate sectors. Nor should the deployment challenges be underestimated; effective 
deployment would require addressing many other requirements. For example, under a 
1.5ºC pathway, McKinsey analysis finds that the number of solar panels installed globally 
per week would be approximately eight times higher than the number today. The rate 
of wind-turbine installations would need to increase fivefold.109 And natural resources, 
including raw materials such as copper, nickel, rare-earth metals, land, and water, 
would also need to be carefully managed to ensure sufficient availability, and minimize 
bottlenecks, and prevent price spikes and inflation. Building out supply chains to support 
the kind of step change in deployment needed requires not only significant capital and the 
right capabilities but also extensive coordination.

 —  Economic and societal adjustments, comprising (4) effective capital reallocation and 

financing structures; (5) management of demand shifts and near-term unit cost increases; 
and (6) compensating mechanisms to address socioeconomic impacts. As we discuss 
in this research, an orderly transition to net zero would require significant changes to 
capital allocation. Companies and countries would need to manage the demand shift 
and cost changes from a wholesale revamping of energy and land-use systems, even as 
the implications for individuals and communities in livelihoods and expenditures could 
be substantial.

 —  Governance, institutions, and commitment, consisting of (7) governing standards, 

tracking and market mechanisms, and effective institutions; (8) commitment by, and 
collaboration among, public-, private-, and social-sector leaders globally; and (9) support 
from citizens and consumers. The pace, scale, and systemic nature of the required 
transition mean that all stakeholders will need to play a role, working together in new 
ways. Securing an orderly transition will require leaders who have the commitment 
and capabilities to develop coherent, reliable, and workable policies and help their 
organizations navigate the changes that lie ahead. The transition is also unlikely to occur 
without the support of citizens and consumers, and in some cases, consumers may need 
to fundamentally shift behaviors to reduce their own emissions.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringAs stakeholders have increased their commitments to net zero, moving from commitments 
to action has not proven easy or straightforward. This is for five reasons: the scale and pace 
of the step-up in spending needed on physical assets, given that entire energy and land-
use systems that evolved over a century or two would have to be transformed over the next 
30 years; the collective and global action required, particularly as the burdens of the transition 
would not be evenly felt; the near-term shifts needed for longer-term benefits; the shifts 
needed in business practices and lifestyles that have evolved over decades; and the central 
role of energy in all economic activity, which means that transformation would need to be 
carefully managed. Indeed, the transition will transform the very systems that support our 
lives and well-being. Even small disturbances to these systems could affect daily lives, from 
raising producer and consumer costs to impairing energy access. This in turn could lead to 
delays and a public backlash. Together, these factors highlight why the prevailing notion of 
enlightened self-interest alone is unlikely to be sufficient to help achieve net zero.

Challenging as the problem may be, not solving it is not an option. A key first step is better 
understanding what it takes to meet the requirements described above. In this report, 
we focus on the second of these groupings of requirements, the economic and societal 
adjustments, to better understand these requirements and how stakeholders can respond. 
There is a real risk that transition burdens could be unbearable to many in the absence of 
compensating measures; for example, if companies and countries do not manage the shifts 
in demand or cost impacts to their existing products and services, or if communities are 
left behind as the world transitions to a net-zero economy. By recognizing the nature and 
magnitude of the changes the net-zero transition would entail, decision makers can better 
prioritize and coordinate actions facilitating a prompt, relatively orderly, and inclusive net-zero 
transition. They can also navigate their organizations toward a prosperous future.110

We illustrate the significant adjustments that would need to be made through an analysis of 
the nature and the magnitude of the transition on demand, capital allocation, costs, and jobs. 
Various other knock-on effects could also ensue and potentially affect, among others, value 
pools, financial valuations, GDP, and global trade flows. While we do not quantify these, we 
discuss some of them qualitatively throughout the report.111

Large-scale decarbonization of the world’s energy and land-use systems will be essential to 
slow and halt the buildup of physical climate risk. But what will the shifts in a transition to net-
zero emissions actually mean for the global economy and individual countries, sectors, and 
consumers? In the following chapters, we provide the findings of our analysis, highlighting the 
extent of the potential shifts, the key challenges, and the opportunities that the transition to 
net zero will bring.

110 The concept of a just transition is sometimes used in the context of the climate transition, with a focus on so-called 
climate justice. This concept implies that the impact of physical and transition risks, as well as the ability to deal with 
these risks, will differ significantly across generations, regions, socioeconomic status, and gender. It also implies that 
these differential risks need to be managed for the transition to be effective and sustainable for the global community 
as a whole. See Mary Robinson, Climate justice: Hope, resilience, and the fight for a sustainable future, Bloomsbury 
Publishing, 2018.

111  We have focused on quantifying the direct shifts, given the vast uncertainties involved in modeling these higher-order 

effects, and because their outcome could vary based on specific actions taken to manage them. For further details on our 
methodology, see the technical appendix.

2. The economic 
transformation

In this chapter, we examine the economic transformation that would need to take place over 
the next three decades to achieve a successful transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. 
We look at the shifts in the economy in aggregate, on energy and land-use systems and the 
sectors that make them up, and on individuals, both consumers and workers. Our focus is on 
four areas—demand, capital allocation, costs, and jobs.112

Our analysis, focused on scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System 
(NGFS), is neither a projection nor a prediction.113 We consider a scenario with a pathway for 
emissions reductions that would give an even chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, with a focus 
on areas that produce about 85 percent of overall emissions. However, it is not clear whether 
the world will be able to keep the temperature increase to that level, or which of numerous 
pathways it may take in an effort to do so. This research does not take a position on such 
questions. Instead, we seek to demonstrate the shifts that would need to take place if the goal 
of 1.5 degrees is to be attainable. 

Even under the relatively orderly net-zero transition scenario considered here, the economic 
transformation will be universal, significant, and often front-loaded, with uneven exposure 
across sectors, geographies and communities, and individuals. Among the challenges is the 
risk of short-term disruptions in energy markets, and in the economy more broadly, if the 
ramp-down of high-emissions activities is not carefully managed in parallel with the ramp-up 
of low-emissions ones. A disorderly transition could affect the economy as a whole and come 
with a backlash that delays the transition.  

For all its short-term risks, the transition will also create rich new opportunities across 
sectors and geographies, for example in the form of new markets for low-emissions products 
and support services. More broadly in considering the economic and societal adjustments 
necessary for achieving net-zero emissions, it is important not to lose sight of the bigger 
context: the substantial longer-term risks from increased warming and the further buildup 
of physical risks. The findings of this research thus highlight the need for more thoughtful and 
decisive action towards an orderly transition to net-zero emissions.

112  Multiple higher-order effects beyond these four areas could also occur as the economy transitions; for example on GDP, 
inflation, valuations, trade flows, and profit pools. We do not directly analyze these, given the complexities of modeling 
these effects, but we discuss some of them qualitatively here and in chapter 4. For further details on our methodology, see 
Box E1 and the technical appendix.

113  Our analysis in this chapter and the full report is focused on a hypothetical path based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 

scenario, which limits global warming to 1.5°C “through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net-zero CO₂ 
emissions around 2050, giving at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5°C by the end of the 
century, with no or low overshoot.” Net zero is reached on a global basis in the scenario. Some high-emissions activities 
in hard to abate sectors such as industry, road freight, and agriculture, do not fall to zero by the middle of the century. 
Residual CO₂ emissions from these activities are counterbalanced by removals such as through land restoration and the 
use of bioenergy with CCS in the scenario. If investment in removals proves insufficient, these high-emissions activities 
would need to fall by an even greater extent to give an even chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C. In some instances, 
variables were downscaled by Vivid Economics to provide more sector granularity, in a manner consistent with the 
overall NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. More broadly, this analysis does not consider the question of how the transition 
is financed, and the impacts that would have on the results shown here. In this chapter, we sometimes compare the 
NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario with the NGFS Current Policies scenario, which projects the greenhouse gas emissions 
that would occur if today’s policies remain in place. To estimate the potential shift in jobs, we conduct a third analysis 
that separates out the transition-related effects from other potential labor-market shifts resulting from GDP growth, 
population growth, productivity gains, and automation adoption. For a detailed discussion of our methodology, see the 
technical appendix.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringSix features characterize 
the net-zero transition

Six features characterize the shifts in energy and land-use systems, economic sectors, and 
countries in the net-zero transition, according to our analysis. They are the following:

Universal. All seven major energy and land-use systems contributes substantially to 
emissions individually, and each will thus need to undergo transformation if the net-zero goal 
is to be achieved. Moreover, these systems are highly interdependent. Actions to reduce 
emissions must therefore take place in concert across the systems. For instance, electric 
vehicles lead to overall emissions reductions only to the extent that low-emissions electricity 
production has been achieved. More broadly, all sectors and geographies must play a role. 
All sectors of the economy participate in these energy and land-use systems across global 
value chains. Similarly, all countries contribute to emissions, either directly or through their 
role in value chains (although with significant differences, as we note below).  

Significant. The economic transformation needed to achieve the transition to net zero will be 
substantial. Our analysis focuses on demand, capital allocation, costs, and jobs. Looking just 
at capital allocation, we find that annual spending on physical assets for the energy and land-
use systems through 2050 would need to be about 60 percent greater than it is today, rising 
by $3.5 trillion annually on average and $0.9 trillion relative to a Current Policies scenario. 
In all, our analysis suggests that the Net Zero 2050 scenario would require spending on 
physical assets of about $275 trillion between 2021 and 2050 (about 7.5 percent of GDP 
over the period) in the areas we analyzed. We also see significant shifts in demand for various 
goods and services in the scenario analyzed here, including steep declines in demand 
for coal, oil, and gas production and an eventual virtual end to manufacturing of cars with 
internal combustion engines, as sales of zero-emissions alternatives (battery-electric and 
fuel cell-electric vehicles) increase from 5 percent of new-vehicle sales in 2020 to virtually 
100 percent by 2050. 

Front-loaded. Several aspects of the transition to net zero would be more significant in the 
early stages of the shift. For example, the capital spending increase noted above would rise 
from 6.8 percent of GDP today to about 9 percent of GDP between 2026 and 2030 before 
falling. Delivered cost of electricity could increase in the near term relative to 2020 levels. 
In our scenario, delivered cost of electricity could rise about 25 percent from 2020 levels until 
2040 and still be about 20 percent higher in 2050 to build out renewable power assets and 
grid infrastructure. In the long run, it is conceivable that the delivered cost of electricity could 
be on par with or potentially even less than today, because renewables have a lower operating 
cost—provided that the power system can find ways to overcome the intermittency of 
renewable power and build flexible, reliable, low-cost grids. The up-front capital spending for 
the net-zero transition could also lower other operating costs over time for consumers. A key 
example of that is mobility. More broadly, action is needed over the next decade to reduce the 
buildup of emissions and prevent rising physical risks that might occur in future decades.

Uneven. While universal, the economic exposure to the transition will not be uniform across 
sectors, geographies, and communities and individuals. First, sectors that account for 
approximately 20 percent of GDP are most directly exposed to the transition; they have 
high levels of emissions in their operations (for example, steel and cement) and in the use 
of their products (for example, automobiles and fossil fuels). Sectors accounting for about 
another 10 percent of GDP are also exposed because of emissions in their supply chains 
(for example, construction).114 Many could see a decline in demand for products in their 
current form. Many of these sectors would also incur cost increases as they decarbonize. 
For example, steel and cement production costs would rise by about 30 percent and 
45 percent, respectively, by 2050, compared with today, in the scenario analyzed here.
Second, lower-income countries or those with economies that depend heavily on fossil fuel 

114  See chapter 3 for details.

McKinsey & Companyresource–producing sectors would also be more exposed; for example, sub-Saharan Africa, 
Latin America, India, and some other Asian countries would require capital spending of about 
10 percent or more of GDP, approximately one and a half times more than the capital spending 
in other regions such as Europe, the United States, and Japan, and deploying this capital may 
be more challenging for these regions; a greater share of their economic activity, employment, 
and capital stock would also be exposed and may need to transform (see chapter 4 for further 
details). Finally, within countries, certain communities could be more affected than others 
if their economies rely heavily on industries that have high levels of emissions or whose 
products are heavy emitters; in the United States, for example, more than 10 percent of 
employment in 44 counties is in coal, oil, and gas, fossil fuel–based power, and automotive. 
Workers in such exposed sectors are especially vulnerable; for example, by 2050 in the Net 
Zero 2050 scenario, demand for fossil fuel–based power jobs could be about 60 percent 
lower compared to today’s direct jobs related to operational activities due to the net-zero 
transition, while millions of new jobs could be created in the renewables sector.115 Finally, any 
increase in prices would affect lower-income households the most. 

Exposed to risks. Management of the transition to net zero will substantially influence 
outcomes, and any net-zero transition scenario including the Net Zero 2050 one we use in this 
research will be exposed to risks. These risks range from the potential for increased physical 
climate risks, if any transition is abrupt or delayed, to heightened labor market disruption in 
the event that the nature of any change is so abrupt that workers have insufficient time to 
adapt. Large-scale asset-stranding is also a significant risk, if an abrupt transition means 
that even relatively new high-emissions assets are retired or replaced with low-emissions 
ones before their normal replacement cycles. Our analysis for stranded assets in the power 
sector suggests that about $2.1 trillion of assets could be prematurely retired or underutilized 
in the net-zero scenario analyzed here between now and 2050.116 One of the most immediate 
risks is that of a disorderly energy transition, if the ramp-up of low-emissions activities does 
not take place fast enough to fill gaps left by the ramping down of high-emissions activities. 
That mismatch could potentially affect energy markets and the economy more broadly if 
energy supply and prices become volatile. This in turn could potentially create a backlash that 
delays the transition. Higher-order effects could include declines in market prices including 
for financial assets.

Rich in opportunity. The opportunities for countries, sectors, and companies could be 
considerable if they are able to tap into growing markets as the world transforms to a net-zero 
economy. Nations that have abundant natural capital, such as more hours of sunshine, or that 
invest in technological, human, and physical capital could be well positioned to prosper in 
the net-zero economy. Companies could also gain from three categories of opportunity: first, 
through decarbonizing processes and products, which can make them more cost-effective 
in some cases or tap into new markets for relatively lower-emissions products; second, from 
entirely new low-carbon products and processes that replace established high-carbon 
options, for example carmakers meeting new demand for electric rather than ICE vehicles; 
and third, through new offerings to support production in the first two categories. These could 
take the form of inputs such as lithium and cobalt for battery manufacturing, physical capital 
such as solar panels, and an array of technical services from forest management to financing 
to emissions measurement. And the most significant benefit of the net-zero transition and 
limiting warming to 1.5°C is preventing the buildup of physical risks and reducing the odds of 
initiating the most catastrophic impacts of a changing climate.

115  By “direct” jobs we mean jobs in the specified sector, as opposed to “indirect” jobs, which refers to the upstream jobs that 

produce inputs for production in the specified sector, as discussed in detail below.

116  Our definition of stranded assets represents the cumulative value of prematurely retired and underutilized assets in 

2020–50, undiscounted. We estimate it by first identifying the level of yearly depreciation that is expected given asset 
life and assumed economic life using data from the WRI Global Power Plant database as input. That figure was multiplied 
by the fraction of assets that are underutilized relative to past average utilization rates (between 2005 and 2020) and 
summed across years. Other research has found similar effects on the power sector. See, for example, Stranded assets 
and renewables: How the energy transition affects the value of energy reserves, buildings and capital stock, International 
Renewable Energy Agency, 2017; and David Nelson et al., Moving to a low-carbon economy: The impact of policy 
pathways on fossil fuel asset values, Climate Policy Initiative, October 2014. Studies in the academic literature for fossil 
fuel stranded value have estimated forgone revenues of between $7 trillion and $11 trillion, discounted over the next 
15 years relative to a current policies scenario. See Jean-Francois Mercure et al., “Reframing incentives for climate policy 
action,” Nature Energy, November 2021.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringDemand: In the scenario analyzed 
here, high-emissions products would 
see shrinking demand, while the 
uptake of low-emissions products 
would create opportunities 

For most companies today, GHG emissions build up along their value chains as they use 
energy and materials to produce and sell their offerings. In some cases, such as for vehicles 
with internal combustion engines, the use of their products also generates emissions. 
Under the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, our analysis suggests, changes in policies, 
technologies, and consumer and investor preferences would drive demand away from goods 
and services whose production or use results in high emissions and toward low- or zero-
emissions goods and services (Exhibit 5). While the transition to a net-zero economy could 
result in the need for transformation in some parts of the economy, it would also provide 
opportunities, as we discuss later in this chapter.

A key demand shift from the Net Zero 2050 scenario relates to energy. Demand for carbon-
intensive fossil fuel energy would fall sharply, while demand for emissions-free electricity, 
as well as hydrogen and biofuels, would rise. By 2050, in this scenario, oil and gas production 
volumes would be 55 percent and 70 percent lower, respectively, than they are today. Coal 
production for energy use would all but disappear.

This shift in energy mix would have cascading effects on sectors that sell products whose 
use relies on fossil fuels. These sectors include makers of internal combustion engine–based 
cars, other transportation equipment, and industrial equipment such as motors and furnaces. 
The mix of products in certain sectors would change as a result; for example, the automotive 
sector would transition from selling ICE cars to electric vehicles. In the Net Zero 2050 
scenario, sales of low-emissions cars would increase from 5 percent of new-vehicle sales 
in 2020 to virtually all sales by 2050.

Demand could also fall or shift for products with high scope 1 emissions as the result of 
emissions-intensive operations. End users of products from those sectors may switch to 
substitutes or reduce their consumption to lower their upstream emissions or minimize their 
exposure to upstream cost increases. In the scenario analyzed here, steel production would 
increase by about 10 percent relative to today, with low-emissions steel rising from one-
quarter of all production to almost all production by 2050. Agriculture and food sectors could 
potentially face the effect of dietary shifts away from emissions-intensive beef and lamb 
toward lower-emissions sources of protein.117  

In other areas, demand could grow.118 Power demand in 2050 in this scenario would more 
than double from today. New industries based on hydrogen, biofuels, and CCS could expand. 
Our analysis suggests that the production of both hydrogen and biofuels would increase more 
than tenfold from now to 2050 in the Net Zero 2050 scenario.119 Carbon management could 
also offer substantial opportunity; for example, in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, forestland 
cover would rise by 160 million hectares by 2050, an increase of 4 percent relative to today, 
sequestering approximately nine metric gigatons of CO₂ by the middle of the century.

117  Over the past two decades, there has been a trend toward greater consumption of meat protein, particularly as many 

developing countries have become wealthier. In the NGFS Current Policies scenario, this trend continues to manifest over 
time between 2020 and 2050, raising the share of livestock within overall food production. See OECD-FAO agricultural 
outlook 2020-2029, OECD, July 2020. In the net-zero scenario analyzed in this report, the share of livestock in 
agricultural production increases at the same rate as in the Current Policies scenario, but consumers allocate more of their 
meat consumption to lower-emission poultry rather than ruminants like beef or lamb.

118  Increased energy access relative to today and growing population globally would also drive some of the increase 

described here.

119  For hydrogen, this excludes captive production for industrial end uses such as refineries and chemicals.

McKinsey & CompanyWhile the discussion above focuses on sectors and products, the Net Zero 2050 transition 
could also affect companies, potentially changing the basis of competition among companies 
within the same sector as they internalize the cost of carbon by paying for abatement 
solutions or by transforming their business models to move out of shrinking markets and 
into growing ones. For example, in sectors such as auto manufacturing, companies such as 
Tesla are offering low-emissions alternatives and incumbents are rapidly adapting to shifts in 
demand, reshaping the sector.

Capital allocation: About $275 trillion 
of spending on physical assets 
would be needed over the next 
three decades under the NGFS 
Net Zero 2050 scenario 

Shifts in demand during the net-zero transition would trigger the retirement or transformation 
of some existing physical assets and the acquisition of new ones.120 Our analysis suggests that 
these moves would influence spending on physical assets in two ways. First, spending would 
increase significantly relative to today. Second, a portion of the capital that is now being spent 
on high-emissions assets would be spent instead on low-emissions assets, including those 
with CCS installed.121  

Our analysis of the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario suggests that about $275 trillion in 
cumulative spending on physical assets, or approximately $9.2 trillion per year, would be 
needed between 2021 and 2050 in the sectors we studied. This is equivalent to about 
7.5 percent of GDP over the period (Exhibit 6).122

120 Based on analysis of systems that account for about 85 percent of overall GHG emissions today. This estimation includes 
spending for physical assets across various forms of energy supply (for example, power systems, hydrogen, and biofuel 
supply), energy demand (for example, for vehicles and alternate methods of steel and cement production), and various 
forms of land use (for example, GHG-efficient farming practices). This includes both what is typically considered 
investment in national accounts and, in some cases, spending on consumer durables such as personal cars. We typically 
consider spending to replace physical assets at the point of emissions (for example, cars for mobility); additional spending 
would also occur through the value chain. We have not sized this to minimize double counting.

121  Our analysis divides high-emissions assets from low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure. Low-emissions 

assets have a relatively low emissions footprint; the term does not always mean carbon neutral. This segmentation was 
done to allow us to size the scale of capital reallocation needed for the net-zero transition. In doing so, we recognize that 
the demarcation between high and low emissions is not always clear. Low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure 
include assets for blue-hydrogen production with CCS; green-hydrogen production using electricity and biomass; 
biofuel production; generation of wind, solar, hydro-, geothermal, biomass, gas with CCS, and nuclear power along with 
transmission and distribution and storage infrastructure; heat production from low-emissions sources such as biomass; 
steel furnaces using EAF, DRI with hydrogen, basic oxygen furnaces with CCS; cement kilns with biomass or coal and gas 
kilns with CCS; zero-emissions vehicles and supporting infrastructure; heating equipment for buildings run on electricity 
or biomass, including heat pumps; district heating connections; cooking technology not based on fossil fuels; building 
insulation; GHG-efficient farming practices; food crops, poultry and egg production; land restoration. 

122 For details of the methodology used to arrive at these figures, see the technical appendix.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringExhibit 6

Spending on physical assets for energy and land-use systems in the NGFS Net Zero 2050

1. We have sized the total spending on physical assets in power, mobility, fossil fuels, biofuels, hydrogen, heat, CCS (not including storage), buildings, industry (steel and 
cement), agriculture, and forestry. Estimation includes spend for physical assets across various forms of energy supply (eg, power systems, hydrogen, and biofuel 
supply), energy demand (eg, for vehicles, alternate methods of steel and cement production), and various forms of land use (eg, GHG-efficient farming practices).
2. Based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2). Based on analysis of systems that account for ~85% of overall CO₂ emissions today. 
Spend estimates are higher than others in the literature because we have included spend on high-carbon technologies, agriculture, and other land use, and taken a 
more expansive view of the spending required in end-use sectors. 

3. Our analysis divides high-emissions assets from low-emissions assets. High-emissions assets include assets for fossil fuel extraction and refining, as well as fossil fuel 
power production assets without CCS; fossil fuel heat production, gray-hydrogen production; steel BOF; cement fossil fuel kilns; ICE vehicles; fossil fuel heating and 
cooking equipment; dairy, monogastric, and ruminant meat production. Low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure include assets for blue-hydrogen production 
with CCS; green-hydrogen production using electricity and biomass; biofuel production; generation of wind, solar, hydro-, geothermal, biomass, gas with CCS, and 
nuclear power along with transmission and distribution and storage infrastructure; heat production from low-emissions sources such as biomass; steel furnaces using 
EAF, DRI with hydrogen, basic oxygen furnaces with CCS; cement kilns with biomass or fossil fuel kilns with CCS; low-emissions vehicles and supporting infrastructure; 
heating equipment for buildings run on electricity or biomass, including heat pumps; district heating connections; cooking technology not based on fossil fuels; building 
insulation; GHG-efficient farming practices; food crops, poultry and egg production; and land restoration.

McKinsey & CompanyThis represents spending related specifically to the deployment of new physical assets 
and to the decarbonization of existing assets. It does not include spending to support other 
adjustments—for example, to reskill and redeploy workers, compensate for stranded assets, 
or account for the loss of value pools in specific parts of the economy. Other research to 
date that has sized investment needs for the transition has largely focused on estimating 
required energy investment. Here we expand this to include additional spending categories.123 
As a result, our estimates exceed to a meaningful degree the $3 trillion to $4.5 trillion of 
annual spending for the net-zero transition that others have estimated.124

The required spending would be front-loaded and would rise from about 6.8 percent of GDP 
today to about 9 percent of GDP between 2026 and 2030 before falling. In dollar terms, the 
increase in spending is about $3.5 trillion per year, or 60 percent, more than is being spent 
today, all of which would be spent in the future on low-emissions assets. This incremental 
spending of $3.5 trillion per year would be worth about 2.8 percent of global GDP on average 
between 2020 and 2050. To put this in comparable terms, the increase is approximately 
equivalent, in 2020, to half of global corporate profits, one-quarter of total tax revenue, 
15 percent of gross fixed capital formation, and 7 percent of household spending.

The second aspect, the reallocation of spending, would also be significant. At present, 
$3.7 trillion—or 65 percent of total spending—goes annually toward high-emissions assets, 
such as coal-fired power plants and vehicles with internal combustion engines. In this net-
zero scenario, about $1 trillion of today’s spending on high-emissions assets would need to 
be reallocated to low-emissions assets. Of the overall $9.2 trillion needed annually for a net-
zero transition over the next 30 years, $6.5 trillion—or 70 percent of total spending—would 
go toward low-emissions assets, reversing today’s trend. The economic transformation that 
this large-scale reallocation of spending implies could lead to some physical assets becoming 
redundant or stranded (see Box 3, “A portion of today’s productive capital stock could be 
stranded under a net-zero transition, with knock-on consequences”).

123 We broadened the analysis here to include a more comprehensive view of spending by households and businesses on 

assets that use energy (for example, the full cost of passenger cars and heat pumps); capital expenditures in agriculture 
and forestry; and some continued spend in high-emissions physical assets like fossil fuel–based vehicles and power 
assets. This spending will be particularly needed in the early years of the transition. Our estimates may thus be higher than 
others in the literature because we have accounted for these categories, including incumbent spending on high-carbon 
technologies, spending on agriculture, and land use, and taken a more expansive view of the spending required in end-use 
sectors. For further details, see the technical appendix.

124 See Net Zero by 2050: A roadmap for the global energy sector, IEA, 2021; NGFS climate scenarios for central 

banks and supervisors, NGFS, 2021; Christoph Bertram et al., “Energy system developments and investments in the 
decisive decade for the Paris Agreement goals,” Environmental Research Letters, volume 16, number 7, June 2021; 
David McCollum et al., “Energy investment needs for fulfilling the Paris Agreement and achieving the Sustainable 
Development Goals,” Nature Energy, volume 3, June 2018. The Energy Transitions Commission found incremental 
spending needs are $1.5 trillion–$1.8 trillion per annum, which is also within the $3 trillion–$4.5 trillion range cited for 
total spending needs. See Making Mission Possible: Delivering a Net-Zero Economy, Energy Transitions Commission, 
September 2020. Back in 2014, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate with an expanded scope more 
similar to this report found investment needs of around $6 trillion between 2015 and 2030, but much smaller incremental 
spending needs. See Better Growth, Better Climate: The New Climate Economy Report, The Global Commission on the 
Economy and Climate, 2014.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringWhile the above comparisons were relative to spending today, if we consider the likely 
evolution of spending across the economy given population growth, GDP growth, and current 
momentum toward the net-zero transition, the capital outlay would be smaller but remain 
significant. If we take as a basis the NGFS Current Policies scenario—which accounts for 
expected income and population growth, as well as currently legislated policies and expected 
cost reductions in key low-emissions technologies—the incremental annual spending in a 
net-zero scenario would be about $0.9 trillion rather than the $3.5 trillion increase noted 
above (Exhibit 7).125 Approximately 50 percent of the $8.3 trillion in annual spending in the 
NGFS Current Policies scenario would be on low-emissions assets, which highlights that 
already some shift to low-emissions spending is anticipated in this scenario from existing 
technological trends and policies today. 

Three groups of systems—mobility, power, and buildings—would account for approximately 
75 percent of the total spending on physical assets in the Net Zero 2050 scenario. 
The mobility system will need the most spending by far between 2021 and 2050—a 
cumulative total of about $105 trillion. The annual average spending of $3.5 trillion over this 
period for road mobility is 1.5 times greater than it is today. This increase is primarily driven by 
the increase in new vehicle sales with population growth and the build-out of BEV charging 
and FCEV refueling infrastructure. With the decline of battery prices, the premium of EV car 
prices to ICE cars is expected to narrow over time (see chapter 3 for details).

The power sector accounts for the second-highest component of spending globally, after 
mobility. This amounts to a cumulative total of $60 trillion between 2021 and 2050, split 
approximately evenly between expanding power production capacity and building out 
enabling infrastructure such as transmission, distribution, and storage. Annual average 
spending over the period is more than twice today’s spending. This is due to increased 
electrification needs of the economy to support growth as well as the net-zero transition, and 
from investment in a system which is moving from high fuel-driven variable costs to one which 
is dominated by capital deployment with relatively low operating expenses. Buildings would 
need cumulative spending of almost $50 trillion between 2021 to 2050 to install heating and 
cooking systems with electric and other alternatives and to improve insulation. 

Although electrification combined with decarbonizing the power supply is a common theme 
in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, it is by no means the only energy shift. Electricity is 
not a suitable energy carrier for many end-user applications, requiring the development of 
alternative low-emissions-fuel options. About $50 billion per year would be needed to expand 
the supply of commercial heat to district heating networks, particularly in regions that have a 
high density of apartment buildings where other low-emissions technologies like heat pumps 
may not be suitable. In addition, about $230 billion per year, or $6.9 trillion in total over the 
next three decades, would be spent in this scenario on increasing production capacity of 
hydrogen and liquid biofuels. This represents a step change in spending relative to today.

Much of these alternative fuels would be used in industry. That would require capital spending 
in sectors such as steel and cement to build alternative production capacity (for example, 
using hydrogen and biomass as fuel sources). Spending would also be needed to retrofit 
machinery (for example, by installing carbon capture and sequestration technology) to lower 
overall emissions intensity. Within industry, some spending on fossil fuels would continue 
as the economy transitions to alternatives. Spending on the extraction, processing, and 
distribution of coal, oil, and gas would amount to close to $20 trillion in total between 2021 
and 2050 in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario; the annual average would be one-third less 
than the annual spend today despite significant population growth over the period as the 
world transitions away from such fuels. 

125 The NGFS Current Policies scenario projects the greenhouse gas emissions that would occur if only today’s policies 

remained in place, and it anticipates about 3°C of warming by 2100. See Box E1 and the technical appendix.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringBox 3

A portion of today’s productive capital stock could be stranded under a net-zero transition, with 
knock-on consequences  

Under a net-zero transition, a proportion of today’s physical capital stock could become redundant in its current form, either 
because it emits large volumes of greenhouse gases or because it would no longer be needed as a result of falling demand for 
emissions-intensive products—for example, manufacturing equipment for internal combustion engines. The physical capital 
stock that is vulnerable would need to be retrofitted to decarbonize operations or face being underutilized or retired before the 
end of its useful life or stranded and lose value, and possibly replaced with new low-carbon assets.1 The stranding of natural 
capital, such as fossil fuel reserves and resources that cannot be used, is also expected to be significant.

In the context of the net-zero transition, stranded physical assets should be taken into account when preparing for the 
transition for a number of reasons. First, the capital stock associated with fossil fuels and emissions is worth many trillions of 
dollars, a significant share of the total global capital stock, and even more capital stock depends indirectly on these assets (for 
example, ICE vehicle plants whose value relies on the continued use of ICE vehicles). Stranding large portions of this capital 
stock in a disorderly or abrupt way could impede value generation in many industrial sectors and, indeed, the global economy. 
Second, many such assets are capitalized on the balance sheets of listed companies. Prematurely retiring these assets would 
potentially lead to the destruction of currently perceived value and to bankruptcies and credit defaults, with knock-on effects 
on the global financial system. Third, stakeholders linked with these assets—from owners of capital to employees, suppliers, 
and the wider economy in locations reliant on high-carbon assets—could see substantial negative effects on their wealth, 
revenues, and livelihoods. 

Certain sectors face the most acute risks. In the fossil fuel sector, external research suggests that producers would forgo 
$7 trillion to $11 trillion of cumulative discounted oil, gas and coal revenues over the next 15 years under a net-zero scenario. 
This prospect has led to concerns about the valuations of companies that own these reserves and about the potential second-
order risks to the financial sector.2

In power, our analysis of the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario suggests that about $2.1 trillion worth of assets could be stranded 
by 2050. About 80 percent of these stranded assets would pertain to fossil fuel–based power plants in operation today, 
primarily coal-fired plants in countries such as China and India (Exhibit 8) which are prematurely retired or underutilized.3 
The remaining 20 percent would relate to assets that are built in the future, particularly future gas plants, that are eventually 
succeeded by alternative technologies. Most coal plants in China and India were built relatively recently and have an average 
capacity-weighted age of less than 15 years. This compares to an average age of more than 30 years in the United States.4 
Their owners face a difficult choice: it is unclear whether early retirement (and replacement) or brown-to-green installations of 
CCS will be more economical. CCS is still expensive and difficult to scale. And while the falling costs of solar and wind power 
are making it harder to justify large outlays to keep coal plants online, installing new renewable-power assets also requires 
substantial capital spending. 

Industrial assets and those used in buildings for heating and cooking may also see some stranding, given relatively long 
asset lifetimes. Aviation and shipping assets could also see stranded asset risk if regulation tightens, and the pace of 
decarbonization increases, particularly if retrofits to substitute fossil fuel use are expensive or difficult because of alternative 
fuel supply constraints.   

1  A physical asset is considered stranded when a decarbonization action causes it to lose value because of early retirement or lower utilization. Stranded value can 

be measured based on loss of book value (the remaining book value of early retired or underutilized assets) or market value (based on forgone future cash flows due 
to price and volume changes from early retirement of assets or lower utilization). Stranding can also be used to describe the effect of the transition on corporate 
valuations, which are typically measured based on the market value approach described previously. The ways in which stranding can take place vary; regulation (for 
example, a carbon price or levy) can strand assets by altering the economics of production, investor or consumer preferences can change, and competing lower-cost 
and lower-carbon technologies can also strand assets. For instance, a coal-fired power plant can strand because the regulator imposes a levy; consumers switch 
to renewable energy sources; investors withdraw capital, which leads to higher cost of capital; or lower-cost renewables put pressure on the wholesale price of 
electricity, thereby making the continued operation of the plant unprofitable.

2  These estimates represent the difference in cumulative revenues over the next 15 years for fossil fuel producers in a net-zero scenario relative to current policies 

discounted by 6 percent. See Jean-Francois Mercure et al., “Reframing incentives for climate policy action,” Nature Energy, November 2021. See also David Nelson 
et al., Moving to a low-carbon economy: The impacts of policy pathways on fossil fuel asset values, Climate Policy Initiative, 2014.

3  Our definition of stranded assets represents the cumulative value of prematurely retired and underutilized assets in 2020–50, undiscounted. We estimate it by first 

identifying the level of yearly depreciation that is expected given asset life and assumed economic life using data from the WRI Global Power Plant database as input. 
That figure was multiplied by the fraction of assets that are underutilized relative to past average utilization rates (between 2005 and 2020) and summed across 
years.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringFinally, close to $30 trillion would cumulatively be spent on expanding agricultural production 
to feed a growing population, shifting some investment towards lower-emissions proteins, 
implementing lower-emissions farming practices such as more efficient use of fertilizers and 
irrigation, avoiding deforestation, and increasing forest cover in other areas (afforestation). 
More than 70 percent of this would be spent in developing regions.

About half of the roughly $275 trillion in capital spending in the Net Zero 2050 scenario 
would be in the United States, China, and Europe. However, developing regions would spend 
more as a proportion of their GDP. Total spending ranges from 9 to 11 percent of GDP from 
2021 to 2050 for developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, India and some other Asian 
countries, and Latin America, compared with about 4 to 7 percent for Europe, Japan, and 
the United States. (For more of our findings about the spending requirements of regions and 
countries, please see chapter 4.)

While the scale of capital deployed is substantial, it is important to put it in context. First and 
foremost, as we discuss later, the economic adjustments involved in reaching net zero in 
an orderly manner would prevent the further buildup of physical risks and the additional 
costs arising from a more disorderly transition. Second, in the long run, the up-front capital 
expenditures for a net-zero transition could result in operating savings for some sectors 
through reduced fuel consumption, improved material and energy efficiency, and lower 
maintenance costs. Much of this capital spending is already cost-effective and comes with a 
return. For example, research analyzing other net-zero scenarios has found that about 40 to 
50 percent of spending can come with a positive investment case.126 Moreover, technological 
innovation could reduce capital costs for net-zero technologies faster than expected.

Various challenges will need to be managed in the short run to achieve these outcomes. 
They include raising capital and securing financing at this scale, managing the technological 
uncertainty of investment, considering risk–return trade-offs, and driving capital flows to 
both developed and developing countries. Raising and deploying capital could be more 
challenging for specific sectors and geographies. See also Box E2 in the executive summary 
on the implications of how the transition is financed.

126 McKinsey research finds that about half of the required investments to reach-net zero emissions in Europe have a positive 
investment case. This means that switching to the relevant low-emissions technology would represent a cost saving at 
the cost of capital for each sector and segment. See Paolo D’Aprile, Hauke Engel, Godart van Gend, Stefan Helmcke, 
Solveigh Hieronimus, Tomas Nauclér, Dickon Pinner, Daan Walter, and Maaike Witteveen, “How the European Union could 
achieve net-zero emissions at net-zero cost,” McKinsey & Company, November 2020. The IEA also examined the actions 
required to be taken by consumers in the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario such as switching to low-emissions vehicles. They 
find that 40 percent would result in overall cost savings relative to an Announced Policies scenario where governments 
follow through on their climate targets and commitments. See World economic outlook, IEA, 2021. On the macroeconomic 
level, higher levels of public and private investment could provide economic stimulus, leading to negligible net negative 
impacts, or even modest net positive impacts, on GDP growth (though as discussed, much depends on how the transition 
is financed and managed). For example, the European Commission found in conducting an impact assessment for 
proposed 2030 net-zero-aligned emissions targets for the European Union that raising policy ambition would result in 
a cumulative impact of between -0.7 percent and +0.55 percent on GDP by 2030 compared to a baseline forecast. See

our people, Commission Staff Working Document SWD/2020/176, September 2020.

McKinsey & CompanyCosts: Some sectors would 
see cost increases in the Net 
Zero 2050 scenario, because of 
shifts in production processes 
and capital expenditures

The transition’s economic implications reach beyond spending on physical assets. 
Production costs, which reflect changing operating costs as well as capital costs for 
new investment and asset depreciation, would also shift as processes are changed and 
assets transformed. And any changes in production costs could possibly affect the costs 
of consumer goods, if these costs are passed through.

In the Net Zero 2050 scenario, industrial sectors in particular could see cost increases from 
changes to production processes and capital expenditures. By bringing operating costs 
together with capital charges resulting from investment and with depreciation costs, we 
assessed the full production cost of various goods. In hard-to-abate sectors like cement and 
steel, our analysis suggests that production costs would increase by about 45 percent and 
30 percent, respectively, by 2050, including because of implementation of technologies such 
as CCS in this scenario (Exhibit 9). In the power sector, delivered cost of electricity globally 
would increase in the near term but then fall over time from that peak. On the other hand, the 
total cost of ownership of electric vehicles is also expected to decrease over time relative 
to ICEs.

In power, the electrification of the economy means that power generation demand would 
dramatically increase: our global analysis suggests that by 2050, it would be about twice 
as high as today in the Net Zero 2050 scenario. Meeting this increased demand with low-
emissions sources would require significant additional capital spending to build out not only 
capacity but also the accompanying transmission and distribution infrastructure and storage 
capacity.127 Our analysis indicates that the global average delivered cost of electricity across 
generation, transmission, distribution, and storage would increase significantly before 
falling, in the scenario modeled here. The impact would be front-loaded: delivered cost of 
electricity would increase by 25 percent from 2020 levels by 2040, including operating costs, 
capital costs, and depreciation of existing and new assets (Exhibit 10). This is for two main 
reasons: firstly, investments will be needed in building renewables, grid and storage capacity, 
creating capital costs and depreciation charges. Secondly, some fossil-based power assets 
would continue to incur capital costs, even if they are underutilized or retired prematurely. 
Indeed, impacts could be significantly higher than those sized here (though it is important to 
note that delivered cost of electricity as sized here is not the same as consumer electricity 
prices). If the transition from high-emissions fossil fuel–based power assets and the ramp-
up of low-emissions assets that replace them is not well managed, both energy costs and 
volatility could go up, and ensuring reliable power may be challenging. Various factors could 

127 To assess cost changes for power, we first quantified the change in three main cost drivers: power generation capital 
charge and depreciation (at a weighted average cost of capital of 6.5 percent), power generation operating costs, and 
transmission, distribution, and storage investments. These were then translated into a delivered cost of electricity by 
dividing by electricity production in each time period. This metric indicates how the underlying costs are changing for 
the entire power sector. Our methodology is broader than other studies focused on the levelized cost of energy for new 
assets which often highlight the competitive cost position of renewables in the power mix. Our analysis also takes into 
account infrastructure spending on grids, capital charges, and depreciation of legacy assets even if they are prematurely 
retired or underutilized. See also Rupert Way et al., Empirically grounded technology forecasts and the energy transition, 
Institute for New Economic Thinking Oxford, working paper number 2021-01, September 2021. Note that our metric is 
different from the actual cost paid by consumers, and eventual energy prices for consumers could look substantially 
different. Consumer electricity prices depend on a multitude of factors, including decisions on how the power system 
transformation is paid for and over what time frame. For example, a key question is how to best manage coal generation 
decommissioning and write-down costs. Moreover not all expected changes in delivered costs are due to decarbonization. 
For instance, some transmission and distribution investments would happen regardless, as countries increase electricity 
access. This analysis does not take into account short-term variations in supply and demand, subsidies, or taxes.

85

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringcontribute to this, including potential grid intermittency issues as renewable assets are 
scaled up, shortage of fossil fuel–based capacity to serve peak loads and provide backup for 
renewables, and shortage of coal and gas inputs for fossil fuel power plants, to name a few.128 
The potential impacts of such outages would be even greater with electricity being used more 
extensively than today across the economy, for example for heating, mobility, and industry. 
Conversely, it is also conceivable that innovation could help drive down costs at a faster rate 
than anticipated, and alternate approaches to grid design could also limit the spending need 
on transmission and distribution. Delivered cost of electricity in the first half of the century 
could then be lower than anticipated in the scenario.

This analysis represents a global average perspective. The picture could look quite different 
across regions depending on the current state of their power system, age of fossil power 
fleets, and availability of natural resources like sunshine and wind, among other factors.

After hitting their peak, costs could subsequently decrease; for example, by 2050, operating 
costs for generation could drop by more than 60 percent relative to today as the energy 
mix shifts to renewables. Some of the reduction in operating and other costs for generation 
would be offset by an increase in the costs associated with grid flexibility, transmission, 
and distribution. As a result, delivered cost of electricity in this scenario would still be about 
20 percent higher in 2050 than 2020 levels. In the long run, the delivered cost of electricity in 
the second half of the century may well be lower than 2020 levels, although this will depend 
on innovations to grid design and evolution of the power system to manage flexibility issues.

In cement, the most significant decarbonization levers are improving energy efficiency, 
replacing fossil fuels with lower emissions fuels (waste and biomass), and reducing the clinker 
share in cement by substituting clinker with supplementary cementitious materials like fly-
ash, granulated slag, limestone, and calcined clay. Once these readily achievable emissions 
reductions have been implemented, decarbonization involves more costly technological 
solutions. Thus, especially in the later years, both capital spending and operating costs could 
increase over time, driven in large part by the installation of CCS. As a result, production costs 
for a ton of cement in the net-zero transition would increase by 45 percent by 2050 relative to 
today, in the scenario modeled here. 

Steel would follow a trajectory similar to cement’s. Decarbonization in steel would require 
the industry to either retrofit existing basic oxygen furnaces with CCS or replace them with 
electric arc furnaces using scrap and gas-based or hydrogen-based direct reduced iron. Both 
of these alternatives have higher operating costs per ton of steel compared with a traditional 
blast furnace. The higher capital spending needs and the higher per-unit operating costs 
would increase steel production costs in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, making a ton of steel 
about 30 percent more expensive to produce by 2050. Continued innovation could lower the 
estimates here for both cement and steel.

Conversely, overall costs could go down for other parts of the economy, in particular mobility. 
For automotive (passenger cars), in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, EVs would account for 
approximately 50 percent of total new car sales by 2030, and low-emissions cars make up 
virtually all sales by 2050 globally. Consumers would incur higher up-front costs to buy zero-
emissions vehicles, at least in the short term. Today, depending on the country and the size of 
the vehicle, the upfront cost of a battery-electric vehicle is generally about 30 to 90 percent 
more than that of an internal combustion engine car. This gap is expected to narrow over time 
with lower battery prices.129 For Europe and the United States, for example, the up-front cost 
of electric cars could be lower than ICE-based cars as soon as 2035. Even with higher upfront 
costs, consumers would see a benefit over time. McKinsey analysis suggests that on a total 
cost of ownership basis, which takes into account purchase price, maintenance, fuel cost, and 
resale value, EVs would be cheaper than ICE cars in most regions by 2025, assuming battery 
costs fall as expected.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringThe total cost of ownership for an ICE car is expected to increase steadily as resale values 
fall due to usage and sale restrictions. For example, the total cost of ownership for battery-
electric cars in Europe may be cheaper compared to that of ICEs by 2025, and the United 
States by 2030. Medium-duty BEV trucks covering 200-300 km a day are expected to 
reach total cost parity with ICEs by around 2025, with heavy-duty long-haul trucks reaching 
parity by 2030 in Europe and later in other regions. Faster declines in battery prices and 
local subsidies could accelerate the break-even point. Finally, as we discuss below, in some 
geographies, overall costs for buildings would also decrease.

McKinsey & CompanyConsumers would face higher up-front 
costs, and may need to spend more 
in the near term on electricity if cost 
increases are passed through, with 
lower-income households most at risk

Consumers would be affected by the net-zero transition in various ways, although the extent 
of the impact could vary depending on the composition of their spending baskets and the 
degree to which production cost changes are passed on. Lower-income households in 
both developed and developing countries are naturally most at risk in the early years of the 
transition from potential rises in energy prices and high up-front capital costs of some low-
emissions products, although all consumers could see some benefits over time.130

First, if significant emissions reductions are to be achieved, consumers may need to adjust 
their spending habits, for example, using more public transportation and shifting diets over 
time away from high-emissions food products such as ruminant protein from beef or lamb to 
other forms of protein such as poultry or other sources such as legumes. Research suggests 
that the price per calorie for processed red meat is more than six times higher than for pulses 
and nuts, and twice as high as white meat, fish and seafood, and eggs.131 

Second, any rise in electricity prices would affect consumers. However, this depends on how 
cost recovery is allocated among customers, up to and including the extent any increases in 
delivered cost of electricity are passed through to end consumers. Electricity constitutes an 
important share of the spending by low-income households, and so any price increases would 
have a disproportionate effect on them unless subsidized.132 

Third, in some cases, consumers would incur relatively high up-front capital costs related 
to road mobility and buildings, particularly in the early years of the transition. While this 
could come with longer-term operating cost savings, making or financing these capital 
expenditures may be more challenging for lower-income households. 

Considering mobility, as discussed above, up-front expenditures are higher for EVs than ICEs 
today, though the gap is narrowing. An individual consumer, though, would see a benefit over 
the life of the vehicle, in terms of reduced total cost of ownership. 

With buildings too, consumers may face higher initial costs, although the extent to which 
they can recuperate this through lower operating costs in the long run varies. In the Net Zero 
2050 scenario, individuals and businesses would need to install heating and cooking systems 
and retrofit insulation. This would entail significant additional up-front spending. Currently, an 
electric heat pump is up to three times more expensive than a gas boiler in some regions for an 
equivalently sized unit. However, over time, the price difference would likely narrow. 
The extent to which consumers can recuperate savings through lower operating expenditure 
is country-specific, because of varying energy prices and depending on how electricity and 
fossil fuel prices evolve in a net-zero transition, as well as the extent of improvements in 
energy efficiency from insulation and newer heating and cooking equipment.133  

130 A comprehensive accounting of the effects on consumers would be complex, since effects vary based on such factors 
as a consumer’s spending basket, whether companies pass through any additional operating or capital costs, and the 
transition’s effect on government revenues and subsidies. Effects on consumers are likely to vary by region. For example, 
the climate transition will likely affect a higher proportion of developing countries’ total spend basket. Individuals’ incomes 
could also be affected by shifts in livelihood or changes in taxation that result from the transition.

across income levels and continents,” Journal of Nutrition, volume 149, issue 11, November 2019.

132 Some governments could potentially subsidize electricity to encourage a mix shift in energy consumption and ensure 

continued access and affordability.

emissions at net-zero cost,” McKinsey & Company, November 2020.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringFourth, higher production costs could also affect the price of consumer goods and services 
in other areas. In the near term, McKinsey analysis finds that zero-emissions container 
shipping fueled by green ammonia could be twice as expensive as standard shipping fueled 
by heavy oil in the Asia-Europe corridor. However, the extent to which this will flow through 
to higher costs for consumers will likely be country- and product-specific.134 Likewise, rising 
costs in hard-to-abate sectors such as steel and cement could raise the cost of end products, 
depending on the fraction of the costs of these materials in final goods and services , and how 
costs are passed through.135 Housing costs may similarly rise to a small extent if the increase in 
steel and cement costs for production is passed on to consumers.

Finally, while not the focus of this research, there is a set of consumer spending related to 
aviation which could be affected, most likely impacting high-income consumers more so 
than low-income ones given the composition of their spend basket. A WEF–McKinsey report 
estimated the cost of production for sustainable aviation fuel could be $900 to $2,300 
per ton in 2050, depending on the pathway, compared with around $500 for conventional 
jet fuel.136

Jobs: The net-zero transition 
analyzed here could lead to a 
reallocation of labor, with about 
200 million jobs gained and 
about 185 million lost by 2050

The scale of the economic transformation set out in this chapter would have consequences 
for the global labor market. The effect on jobs would be especially notable not so much 
for its overall size in terms of net losses or gains as for its concentrated, uneven, and 
re-allocative nature.

Our analysis of the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario suggests that the transition could result in 
an increase in demand for about 162 million direct and indirect jobs (referred to as “job gains”) 
and a decrease in demand for about 152 million direct and indirect jobs (referred to as “job 
losses”) in operations and maintenance by 2050 across different sectors of the economy. 
In addition, about 41 million jobs could be gained and 35 million lost related to direct and 
indirect jobs associated with spending on physical assets needed for the net-zero transition 
by 2050 (Exhibit 11). Jobs in the latter category, linked to higher capital spending, are likely 
to be more transitory than those in the former, related to operations and maintenance, as 
discussed below. Together, this results in about 202 million direct and indirect jobs gained and 
about 187 million lost by 2050. 

134 For example, research has highlighted that the cost of jeans may only rise by 1 percent but this might vary for other product 
types. See Hydrogen insights: A perspective on hydrogen investment, market development and cost competitiveness,

1.

Includes all direct and indirect jobs; based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2). Based on analysis of systems that account for 
~85% of overall emissions today; a job is counted as a gross loss or a gain if it involves a shift in sector or subsector for a worker (indicating a changing job function), or 
geography of an existing job. Operations and maintenance jobs consist of those related to the operations and maintenance activities in the sector (direct jobs), and 
their supply chains (indirect jobs). Capex jobs are those arising from capital investment in the sector, associated with manufacturing and construction (direct jobs), and 
their supply chains (indirect jobs), and are not included in the 2020 baseline number. While calculating indirect jobs, we include upstream jobs from all other sectors of 
the economy such as financial services, wholesale trade, retail trade, transportation etc, but exclude a set of sectors for which we have done bottom-up calculations, 
including: Agriculture, forestry and fishing, mining and extraction of energy; coke and refined petroleum, other nonmetallic mineral products, manufacture of basic 
metals, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; power; machinery, and equipment and construction. Impacts of a net-zero transition consist of job losses and gains 
directly associated with the transition, and do not include other macroeconomic forces like population or income growth. See technical appendix.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringWhen considering job losses and gains here, we only consider those which are directly 
attributable to the net-zero transition, rather than other factors like income or population 
growth (see Box 4, “Our methodology for estimating employment effects in the net-
zero transition”).137

Job gains would be largely associated with the transition to low-emissions forms of 
production, for example to renewable-power production, while the losses would particularly 
affect workers in fossil fuel–intensive or otherwise emissions-intensive sectors. The size of 
the job dislocation needs to be put in perspective in the context of other trends. For example, 
previous research by the McKinsey Global Institute suggests that automation, remote work, 
and e-commerce trends could lead to the loss of approximately 270 million to 340 million 
jobs in eight countries between 2018 and 2030, with commensurate job gains expected at 
a similar scale. Those figures are considerably higher than our estimate for global job losses 
and gains related to the net-zero transition, in the scenario analyzed here.  

The net increase of about 15 million jobs reflects the net change in employment associated 
with shifts in economic activity in the specific energy and land-use systems modeled here for 
transition to the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. It is important to put this number in context. 
First, this number is small relative to the net decrease of 114 million jobs—unrelated to the 
transition and driven by other factors such as productivity growth—that we find over the same 
period for the sectors analyzed here (in large part driven by the decrease of 184 million jobs 
in agriculture as productivity increases). Second, it is also small relative to the job losses and 
gains that underpin the net number and the overall scale of the global economy. Thus, the 
main issue at hand is the re-allocative and uneven nature of job shifts that underpin the net-
zero transition. 

Job gains associated with spending on physical assets for the net-zero transition would 
be higher in the earlier years of the transition. In construction, manufacturing, and other 
industries associated with the build-out of low-emissions physical assets, net job gains 
(gross job gains minus gross job losses) from the net-zero transition could be as high as about 
37 million by 2030 and could still be five million by 2050 (see Exhibit 12). Capital expenditures 
in new electricity generation infrastructure and retrofitting buildings alone could result in 
more than 57 million gross job gains by 2030.138

While our analysis has focused on what can be expected from the foreseeable job shifts 
from the transition, historical analyses have found new technologies typically created many 
more jobs than they destroyed. This includes new jobs that are in occupations which cannot 
be envisioned at the outset; for example, one study calculated 0.56 percent of new jobs in 
the United States each year are in new occupations.139 Thus, the true potential job creation 
from the adoption of new climate technologies is likely to be larger than the estimates here 
particularly when considering the numerous opportunities from a net-zero transition, as we 
discuss later. 

137 Job losses and gains described in this analysis refer to those tied specifically to transition-related changes (for example, 
the shift from fossil fuel energy production to solar, wind, and other low-emissions sources of electricity). Losses and 
gains due to macroeconomic forces such as income, population, and productivity growth have also been excluded. A job 
is counted as a loss or a gain if it involves a shift in sector or subsector for a worker, indicating a changing job function, or a 
change in the geography of an existing job. O&M jobs consist of those related to the operations and maintenance activities 
in the sector and their supply chains, and include direct and indirect jobs. Indirect jobs are those created in the supply 
chain of the sector. In calculating indirect jobs, we exclude a set of sectors for which we have done bottom-up calculations 
elsewhere, including agriculture, forestry, and fishing; mining and extraction of energy; coke and refined petroleum, other 
nonmetallic mineral products, manufacture of basic metals, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; power; machinery, 
and equipment and construction. We do this to avoid double counting our job impacts. The indirect jobs shifts would 
be about 15 to 25 percent higher if all upstream sectors are considered, without netting out the job changes from other 
modeled sectors. See technical appendix for details.

138 For more information, see The future of work after COVID-19, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2021.
139 This implies that about 20 percent of the workforce today is employed in an occupation that essentially did not exist 
in 1980. Jeffrey Lin, “Technological adaptation, cities, and new work,” Review of Economics and Statistics, volume 
93, number 2, May 2011. See also Jobs lost, jobs gained: What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and wages, 
McKinsey Global Institute, December 2017. Most jobs created by technology are outside the technology-producing 
sector itself. Past estimates by MGI suggest that the introduction of the personal computer, for instance, has enabled 
the creation of 15.8 million net new jobs in the United States since 1980, even after accounting for jobs displaced. About 
90 percent of these were in occupations that use the PC in other industries, such as call center representatives, financial 
analysts, and inventory managers.

Our methodology for estimating employment effects in the net-zero transition 

The transition to net zero will not be the only global trend affecting employment between 2021 and 2050. Significant shifts are 
likely across all job sectors as a result of other trends including population growth, sector-specific productivity enhancements, 
rising incomes, an aging population, and technological disruptions from automation and AI adoption.1 Given these factors, we 
sought to disaggregate job gains and losses specifically associated with achieving net-zero emissions under the Net Zero 
2050 scenario, from these other factors. When transition-related job changes are referred to in this report, figures include 
both technological and policy changes already planned or in the process of implementation as well as incremental changes 
required to achieve net zero by 2050. Figures exclude changes associated with the macroeconomic and within-sector 
productivity trends outlined above.

Our analysis captures potential effects of shift in demand for jobs across subsectors, sectors, and geographies; we refer to 
rising demand for jobs as “jobs gained,” and diminishing demand for jobs as “jobs lost.” In reality, this could manifest as a shift 
in job activity for individual workers. In an effort to describe a comprehensive view of job transitions tied to achieving net zero 
by 2050, calculations for gross job losses and gains include those arising from demand for new jobs (for example, CCS jobs 
that do not currently exist), diminished demand in some parts of the economy (for example, coal mining jobs, which are likely 
to be lower in 2050 under a net-zero scenario than under a no-transition case), demand for jobs shifting between subsectors 
within a given sector (for example, a job that shifts from coal to solar power generation counts as both one job lost and one job 
gained), and demand for jobs shifting across regions. While many such job losses and gains will occur between now and 2050 
across sectors of the economy from the macroeconomic forces described previously, job losses and gains analyzed in this 
report are focused on sectors within the energy and land-use systems most closely tied to achieving the net-zero transition, 
and any indirect effects resulting from this. Thus, for various reasons, this analysis by design does not capture broad labor 
market shifts expected over the next three decades, but narrowly focuses on the shifts from a net-zero transition alone.

Throughout our discussion we account for both the jobs in our focus sectors (direct jobs) and the upstream jobs associated 
with final demand in our focus sectors (indirect jobs). The indirect jobs are calculated using multipliers derived from input-
output tables that account for local and imported inputs to production in our focus sectors. Because the direct jobs of each 
sector we model are in some cases upstream jobs in another modeled sector (for example, an oil and gas job is an upstream 
job for the fossil-based power sector), we take a final step of netting out any double counting. This analysis has numerous 
uncertainties and we have needed to make assumptions, for example related to productivity growth within sectors and 
subsectors, and relative productivity levels across different technologies. 

Our methodology does not account for any higher order impacts and assumes an orderly transition, one in which high 
emissions assets are ramped down and low emissions assets are ramped up to the levels needed, without constraints or 
challenges, including those related to financing the transition or securing job transitions. Finally, overall employment levels 
across the economy as a whole will also depend on fiscal and monetary policy that could be constrained by the aggregate 
financing requirement of the net-zero transition, which we do not model. See the technical appendix for further details.

This research seeks to build and expand on the vast existing literature on job implications of a net-zero transition.2 Our results 
differ from those typically cited by other sources for several reasons. First, the emphasis of our research extends beyond 
calculating “net” job impacts; rather, we focus on the job reallocations (losses and gains) that the net-zero transition would 
entail, to capture the nature and magnitude of economic and societal adjustments needed. Second, we take a comprehensive 
view across 12 major economic sectors of job shift. And finally, we take an expansive view of jobs affected, including direct 
and indirect (upstream) jobs, O&M and capital expenditure jobs, and the consideration of job shifts across subsectors and 
geographies as part of total reallocations (gross gains plus gross losses). See the technical appendix for further detail.

Includes all direct and indirect capital expenditure–related jobs. Scenario based on the Network for Greening the Financial System Net Zero 2050 scenario using 
REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2). Based on analysis of systems that account for ~85% of overall emissions today; a job is counted as a gross loss or a gain if it involves a 
shift in sector or subsector for a worker (indicating a changing job function), or geography of an existing job. Job losses and gains only include those directly associated 
with the impacts of a net-zero transition, and do not include other macroeconomic forces like population or GDP growth. See technical appendix.

Global Institute analysis

Job losses may also be higher than our analysis here. Our estimates of the employment 
transitions from the net-zero transition presuppose that it will take place in an orderly fashion, 
including for labor. In the event of a more disorderly transition, the labor market consequences 
could be more severe. Job transitions may happen more abruptly, reskilling and redeployment 
for workers would be more challenging, and job losses may also be more substantial as 
companies do not have sufficient time to ramp down high-emissions businesses and scale up 
low-emissions ones. Moreover, depending on the approach taken to finance the transition, job 
losses could be higher than presented here, if spending to build a net-zero economy reduces 
spending in other parts of the economy.

The shifts in employment in the net-zero transition are likely to be marked by their unevenness 
and concentration. Indeed, the overall numbers may understate the degree of disruption 
for individual workers in some sectors and geographies. A large proportion of jobs could be 
lost in certain sectors, such as coal mining, oil and gas extraction and production, fossil-based 
power, and livestock farming, while other sectors such as renewable-energy generation, 
EV production, energy crop production, and new sectors like hydrogen and biofuels could 
see considerable job gains. The job changes are also likely to be concentrated geographically. 
The combination of these losses and gains could result in potential structural and permanent 
shifts in the labor market. These shifts will require both business- and public-sector leaders to 
effectively prepare and plan for large-scale training and reskilling programs, labor transitions 
across industries and geographies, and new efforts to develop the future workforce needed 
to fill entirely new roles across sectors. We discuss these shifts more in the next section.

94

McKinsey & CompanyPotential job gains and losses would likely be concentrated, sparking 
transitions for workers across sectors, roles, skills, and geographies

The labor market shifts in our analysis mirror the changes in sectoral demand, with the 
heaviest job losses occurring in sectors or subsectors most exposed to decreases in demand, 
while gains would fall predominantly in sectors or subsectors experiencing increases in 
demand (for example, solar, wind, and other renewables). We detail the potential job gains and 
losses by sector in chapter 3. Of the 187 million job losses by 2050 in the net-zero transition 
scenario analyzed here, our analysis shows that approximately 62 million are direct operations 
and maintenance (O&M) jobs concentrated primarily in agriculture and food (about 34 million, 
related to diminished production of ruminant meat), automotive (13 million), and oil, gas, and 
coal extraction and production (about nine million). 

Approximately 89 million additional jobs are indirect O&M jobs, mainly upstream from the 
automotive sector (55 million jobs), and upstream from oil, gas, and coal extraction and 
production (23 million).140 The remaining 35 million losses are direct and indirect construction 
and manufacturing jobs, mainly related to oil, gas, and coal (18 million) and fossil fuel–based 
power (16 million). The most significant relative losses of direct O&M jobs in the scenario 
analyzed here would be in the internal combustion engine portion of the automotive sector. 
The agricultural sector would see the largest direct job losses in absolute terms, driven by the 
shift in animal-protein demand and associated livestock and feed-related jobs.

By contrast, low-emissions sectors would see job gains as demand and capital spending 
shift toward them. For example, the low-emissions power sector could see a threefold to 
fourfold increase in employment relative to today. The power sector overall could see the 
highest job gains relative to current numbers, adding about 25 million jobs in direct and 
indirect operations and maintenance, in addition to gains of 33 million jobs in construction, 
manufacturing, and associated sectors that support increases in low-emissions capacity and 
overall power demand by 2050.

Of the 202 million jobs gained by 2050 from the net-zero transition, about 81 million are direct 
O&M job gains, mainly in agriculture and food (61 million, related to expanding production of 
energy crops and poultry), automotive (nine million), electricity generation (six million), and 
hydrogen and CCS (three million).141 An additional 81 million are indirect O&M job gains, about 
half from automotive and one-fourth from electricity generation. The rest of the job gains, 
about 41 million, are direct and indirect jobs created by capital spending primarily from the 
build-out of renewable electricity (three-fourths of the total), development of hydrogen and 
biofuels production, infrastructure supporting EVs, and retrofits of insulation in buildings. 

These losses and gains could translate into job transitions for many workers, involving the 
movement of workers across skills, roles, companies, sectors, and geographies. We detail 
some of these in our discussion of the geographic dimensions of a net-zero transition in 
chapter 4.

140 In calculating indirect jobs for specific sectors, we exclude a set of sectors for which we have done bottom-up calculations 
elsewhere, including agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining and extraction of energy; coke and refined petroleum, other 
nonmetallic mineral products, manufacture of basic metals, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; power; machinery, 
and equipment and construction. We do this to avoid double counting our job impacts. The indirect job shifts would be 
about 15 to 25 percent higher if all upstream sectors are considered, without netting out the job changes from other 
modeled sectors. See the technical appendix for details.

141  While the agricultural sector would see overall net job gains from a net-zero transition, the trend would be one of declining 
agricultural jobs relative to today by 2050, due to an ongoing farm-to-nonfarm transition. The net-zero transition would 
only marginally offset this trend. For further details, see chapter 3.

95

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringOne example of the skills transition is the shift of jobs in automotive under our scenario. 
Even as ICE vehicles are replaced with EVs, demand for vehicle repair and maintenance will 
continue. However, the skills required to work on EVs are different from those for ICE vehicles. 
Repairing and maintaining ICE vehicles involve technical expertise in mechanical equipment 
and physical repair of parts and components. EVs demand technical expertise in electrical 
equipment as well as the advanced electronic and computer systems deployed to run them, 
especially in regulating battery performance.142

Specific communities could be disproportionately affected because job losses could account 
for a large share of local employment. For example, jobs in fossil fuel extraction and refining 
are concentrated in locations with raw-material deposits and capital-intensive infrastructure. 
Often, they are the main source of employment for local communities. The decline of the fossil 
fuel industry would thus cause disproportionate job losses in these communities. 

For example, analysis of data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics finds that 10 percent 
or more of the employment in 44 US counties is in the coal, oil and gas, fossil fuel–based 
power, and automotive sectors (Exhibit 13). For example, in seven US counties in the states 
of Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming, more than 10 percent of workers are 
employed in coal mining.  

Similar challenges may also exist for countries. For example, automotive production is a 
relatively large share of employment in Germany, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea, which 
would therefore be exposed to the transition and need to identify how they can best capture 
transition opportunities. A key challenge of the net-zero transition would thus be managing 
job losses that affect entire sectors or subsectors and are also geographically concentrated 
in specific communities or regions.

Disruptions would be 
substantially higher under a 
more disorderly transition

How the transition is managed will be decisive. The effects described here reflect the NGFS 
Net Zero 2050 scenario, in which gradual yet substantial reductions in emissions take place, 
resulting in a relatively orderly transition. However, the complexity of the transformation 
may well lead to the reality being more disorderly, and indeed it may not be feasible to limit 
warming levels to 1.5°C. This makes the case for action towards securing an orderly transition 
even more critical.

The key risks are threefold: the first concerns the choice of pathway to arrive at net-zero 
emissions, and whether this will be smooth or abrupt. The second relates to the measures 
taken by stakeholders to ease the adjustments needed for a net-zero transition. The third has 
to do with a range of constraints that could prove challenging even if the pathway chosen is a 
relatively smooth and gradual one.

142 As EVs replace ICE vehicles, demand for technical expertise in the automobile aftermarket will shift away from knowledge 

of ICE-specific components (for example, engine systems, transmissions, and fuel injection) and toward EV-specific 
components (for example, dedicated hybrid transmissions, batteries, BMS and inverters, heads-up displays, and 
advanced sensors like LiDAR). See “Why the automotive future is electric,” McKinsey & Company, September 2021.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Many possible combinations of emissions-reduction trajectories and socioeconomic 
adjustments could limit warming to 1.5°C, and these scenarios could lead to higher or lower 
risks than those that we have analyzed under the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. One of 
the key differences between various transition pathways is when the transition to net-zero 
emissions starts and how abruptly emissions are reduced to reach net zero.143 

Some pathways to net-zero emissions assume that the decline in emissions begins 
immediately and progresses gradually to 2050. Others assume that reduction of emissions 
begins later and progresses more quickly to achieve the same amount of cumulative 
emissions. The latter could involve significant and abrupt changes in policy, high carbon 
prices, and sudden changes to capital spending practices—along with greater socioeconomic 
effects and a larger-scale response.144

Second, if actions are not taken to manage transition disruptions, this could lead to more 
challenges, especially for vulnerable communities—for example, if any rises in energy costs 
are passed through to low-income households, or if displaced workers are not provided 
appropriate support to reskill and redeploy. Finally, even if the pathway chosen is relatively 
orderly, given the scale of the transformation required, supply may not be able to scale up 
sufficiently, making shortages and price increases or volatility a feature. Other costs could 
also be incurred and investment needed beyond those mentioned in this report, for example 
related to the reskilling of workers, or economic diversification efforts. A key area where 
additional spend would be needed is related to adaptation investments (see chapter 1 for 
further details). 

Quantifying the effects of these risks is challenging because of the many uncertainties; we 
instead describe various factors that could influence the scale of effects under a disorderly 
transition, as follows: 

Risk of supply constraints. Rapidly scaling up demand for low-emissions assets and other 
products needed for the transition, without corresponding scale-up of supply, could lead to 
supply/demand imbalances, supply shortages, price increases, and inflation, for example 
associated with key commodities or equipment needed for a net-zero transition. This 
could occur even in a scenario where action begins now to reduce emissions in a relatively 
gradual manner, if the transition is not well managed.145 In particular, a mismatch or mistiming 
between the ramping down of high-emissions activities and the ramping up of low-emissions 
activities could impair energy supply and affect energy access and affordability. This could 

143 Another key difference between transition pathways is the assumptions made about the potential for carbon dioxide 
removal (CDR). In pathways with significant CDR, gross emissions can be higher because they are counterbalanced in 
part by removals. At the end of the scenario, they also allow the economy to converge on net-zero CO₂ emissions even 
with some low residual gross emissions in certain hard-to-abate sectors. In some transition scenarios, CDR is used 
in the second half of the century to compensate for overshooting carbon budgets earlier. In the NGFS Net Zero 2050 
scenario, there is moderate use of CDR but only a “limited temporary overshoot” of temperature targets. The process and 
benefits of CDR on emissions reductions is still unproven at scale, and so brings risks of permanent and more significant 
climate effects. If no CDR is assumed, gross emissions would have to be cut even more sharply to limit warming to a given 
temperature target.

144 Central banks and supervisors have raised concerns about risks from a disorderly transition. This could involve sudden 
and unanticipated shifts in capital allocation, labor markets, and financial market sentiment. The NGFS—the group of 
central banks and financial supervisors that produced the scenarios on which this report is based—has developed two 
such disorderly scenarios. The Delayed Transition scenario assumes annual emissions continue to increase until 2030 
when strong policies are introduced to limit warming to below 2°C. The Divergent Net Zero scenario reaches net zero 
around 2050 but with higher costs because of divergent policies being introduced across sectors and regions and a 
quicker phase-out of oil use. For another example, see Inevitable Policy Response 2021: Policy Forecast, Principles for 
Responsible Investment, March 2021. The Inevitable Policy Response (IPR) provides a policy forecast for the most likely 
policy actions likely to be taken across different sectors of the economy as economies ratchet up their commitments 
under international climate agreements before 2025. IPR modeled the effect on sectoral stock market valuations of a 
response by 2025 that is forceful, abrupt, and disorderly because of the delay. Previous analysis from the IPR in 2019 
found that while overall impacts would be manageable, there may be substantial disruptions at the sector and company 
levels. For example, the IPR calculation showed that the 100 worst-performing companies in the MSCI ACWI would lose 
about 43 percent of their current value, equivalent to $1.4 trillion, while the 100 best performers would gain 33 percent of 
current value, equivalent to $0.7 trillion. Automakers with the highest investments in EVs could see their value increase by 
108 percent, and the world’s largest listed coal companies could halve in value (-44 percent). The ten largest companies 
in the integrated oil and gas exploration and production sector could lose nearly one-third (31 percent) of current value, or 
$500 billion. See Implications for strategic asset allocation, Principles for Responsible Investment, 2019.

145 For example, see “The raw materials challenge: How the metals and mining sector will be at the core of enabling the energy 
transition,” McKinsey & Company, January 2022. The research describes a scenario where by 2030, based on the current 
pipeline of projects and without measures to incentivize further supply, copper and nickel demand could exceed supply by 
5 million to 8 million and 700,000 to one million metric tons, respectively. See also 2022 global outlook: Thriving in a new 
market regime, Blackrock Investment Institute, 2022.

than sized here, to maintain flexibility and redundancy in energy systems. Another risk is that 
stakeholders maintain two parallel energy systems in a manner that is inefficient and not cost 
effective. Thus the transformation of the energy system needs to be carefully managed. And 
there may be other constraints, including accessing the volume of financing required in the 
initial phases of the transition when many costs would be front-loaded.

Increased labor market disruption. A delayed, abrupt scenario would make it much 
harder for workers to transition. Even with the prospect of new jobs in growing sectors, the 
abrupt nature of the change would mean workers may have insufficient time to develop new 
skills and find their next job. In Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
countries, unemployment in sectors such as agriculture and food, electricity, manufacturing, 
mining, and transportation lasts about five to seven months, on average.146 If workers need to 
develop new skills to find employment (for example, when moving from industries with high 
fossil fuel intensity to others), this period can be even longer. Past research by the McKinsey 
Global Institute points to particular challenges for young workers who miss out on valuable 
experience if they are unemployed early in their careers. This disruption in employment 
may have a lasting scarring effect on productivity, employment, and career prospects.147 
Depending on the nature of support measures for displaced workers and communities, 
effects on specific sectors or geographies could be especially acute. More broadly, 
depending on the approach taken to finance the transition, job losses could be substantially 
higher than described here.148

Risk of asset stranding. A more abrupt transition could cause assets to be retired and 
replaced with low-carbon assets before their normal replacement cycles, as would occur 
in a gradual transition. Coal power plants typically have a lifetime of 40 to 60 years, while 
gas power plants have lifetimes of 30 to 50 years. While relatively older assets can largely 
be retired naturally over the course of a gradual transition, younger assets and any new 
assets built between now and 2050 face the risk of premature retirement or underutilization. 
These risks could be higher under a more abrupt transition. To illustrate this, we analyzed two 
NGFS scenarios consistent with limiting warming to less than 2°C from preindustrial levels. 
In the “Below-2°C scenario” where emissions reductions start immediately on a pathway 
to 2.0°C of warming, our analysis suggests that additional coal power capacity added is 
relatively small, only about $150 billion between 2020 and 2050, of which $100 billion 
would be prematurely retired or underutilized. But in the scenario where emissions reductions 
toward 2.0°C warming start later, a substantially larger amount of capacity is added; as much 
as $600 billion would be invested in coal-power capacity, with as much as $400 billion 
prematurely retired or underutilized.149 

Greater risk of higher-order effects. Under any scenario, there are also higher-order 
effects which could occur, for example related to GDP or financial valuations, which we have 
not sized here. In a delayed or abrupt transition scenario in particular, effects could include a 
sharp decline in market prices for financial assets, with potential knock-on consequences for 
market liquidity and solvency of intermediaries, drops in economic performance for countries, 
sustained revenue losses for businesses, and enduring financial distress for individuals.

149 Our definition of stranded assets represents the cumulative value of prematurely retired and underutilized assets in 

2020–50, undiscounted. We estimate it by first identifying the level of yearly depreciation that is expected given asset 
life and assumed economic life using data from the WRI Global Power Plant database as input. That figure was multiplied 
by the fraction of assets that are underutilized relative to past average utilization rates (between 2005 and 2020) and 
summed across years.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringIncreased physical climate risks. A delayed transition would heighten the physical risks of 
failing to limit warming to 1.5°C. Delay could result from inherent time constraints, such as 
construction times for low-carbon infrastructure and manufacturing assets or reskilling times 
for workers. For instance, the design and construction of renewables projects typically lasts 
two to six years in developed economies such as Europe and the United States, based on 
McKinsey estimates. If these timelines cannot be accelerated to match the pace of an abrupt 
transition, there is a risk that warming thresholds would be breached. This is turn raises the 
risk of substantially increasing adaptation spending on top of decarbonization efforts.

While significant, these economic 
adjustments would create growth 
opportunities and prevent further 
buildup of physical risk 

While entailing substantial transformation, the changing demand outlook combined with the 
$3.5 trillion in incremental annual spending on physical assets in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 
scenario, noted above, would create growth opportunities for companies and countries in the 
near term. We describe the opportunities for countries later in this report. The opportunities 
for companies are in the following three main areas: 

Decarbonized forms of legacy products and processes: Companies that reduce the 
emissions intensity of their processes and products could gain advantages as the transition 
progresses. In some cases, decarbonizing processes and products can make them more 
cost-effective. For example, improving the energy efficiency of heating systems in steel 
plants lowers both emissions and operating costs. Even when decarbonizing adds to 
operating costs, companies can benefit from taking this step—for instance, if consumers 
are willing to pay more for lower-emissions products or if companies are subject to carbon-
pricing mandates.

Low-emissions products and processes that replace established high-emissions 
options: Carmakers might make EVs instead of ICE vehicles, for example. Steelmakers can 
implement low-emissions production processes such as manufacturing steel with direct 
reduced iron–electric arc furnaces (DRI-EAF) powered by green hydrogen.150 Utilities might 
set up wind or solar farms to generate renewable electricity, while energy companies could 
introduce biofuels and hydrogen. 

Inputs, physical capital, infrastructure, and support services: New offerings will be 
needed to support production in the first two areas. These include, among others, mining 
raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and rare-earth elements, as well as other inputs 
such as beneficiated iron ore for DRI-EAF steelmaking or new feed additives to mitigate 
methane emissions from livestock; manufacturing the physical assets needed to support 
decarbonization, such as solar panels, district heating systems, and long-duration 
batteries (to address the intermittency of solar and wind power); and building and operating 
infrastructure such as EV charging stations and hydrogen refueling stations.151 A low-carbon 

150 DRI is produced from the chemical reduction of iron ore into iron by either a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced 
from natural gas or coal, which can be used as an input, along with high-grade steel scrap, in the EAF method of steel 
production. Steel production in integrated blast furnaces or basic oxygen furnaces today uses iron ore and requires coal 
as a reductant. See Christian Hoffmann, Michel Van Hoey, and Benedikt Zeumer, “Decarbonization challenge for steel,” 
McKinsey & Company, June 2020.

151  For example, see “The raw materials challenge: How the metals and mining sector will be at the core of enabling the 

energy transition,” McKinsey & Company, January 2022. The research finds that requirement for additional supply will 
come not only from relatively large-volume raw materials—for example, copper for electrification and nickel for battery 
EVs, which are expected to see significant demand growth beyond their current applications—but also from relatively 
niche commodities, such as lithium and cobalt for batteries, tellurium for solar panels, and neodymium for the permanent 
magnets used both in wind power generation and EVs. Some commodities—most notably steel—will also play an enabling 
role across technologies, as additional infrastructure is needed.

100

McKinsey & Companyeconomy will also require a broader enabling ecosystem to facilitate decarbonization activities 
and support a transition. Examples include financial products (for example, funding for 
renewables projects), risk management solutions, standard setting and certification services, 
improved data and tracking for emissions (such as via digital solutions), and training and 
education services. 

The incremental capital spending on physical assets, which we estimate at about 3 percent 
of GDP annually through 2050 as discussed previously, and the broader economic 
transformations under a net-zero transition would have another essential feature: most 
importantly, reaching net-zero emissions and limiting warming to 1.5°C would prevent the 
buildup of physical risks and reduce the odds of initiating the most catastrophic impacts of 
climate change, including limiting the risk of biotic feedback loops and preserving the ability 
to halt additional warming.152

As the analysis of the shifts in demand, capital allocation, costs, and jobs highlights, the 
transition to net zero will amount to a full-scale economic transformation, one that will be 
universal in scope, significant in size, often front-loaded, and uneven in impact. Multiple 
challenges will need to be overcome, including the diversion of capital from high-carbon to 
low-carbon assets, the stranding of some physical assets, the movement of workers within 
and across industries and geographies, and the displacement of demand from existing goods 
and services to new or decarbonized products and services. The risk that such a transition 
could be disorderly is very real. At the same time, it is also clear that this transition could bring 
new opportunities for nations and businesses around the world and is crucial to avoiding the 
most catastrophic impacts of a changing climate. In the next two chapters, we look in detail 
at the potential shifts in the energy and land-use systems examined in this research and 
across geographies.

152 See Box E3 in the executive summary, chapter 1, and the bibliography for a detailed list of the academic literature and 

broader discussion related to physical climate risks.

3. The net-zero 

transition in energy 
and land-use systems

In this chapter, we take a closer look at how a net-zero transition could affect the energy and 
land-use systems we described in previous chapters and, by extension, the economic sectors 
that participate in these systems. Using as a starting point the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, 
we look at what the decarbonization implications would be for each.153 We seek to measure 
the potential changes in demand and the necessary spending on physical assets to reach 
net-zero emissions, as well as the implications for costs and jobs. We also focus on key short-
term risks and challenges, and on the opportunities in each sector, and identify key takeaways 
for stakeholders.

As part of this exercise, we estimated how exposed to the transition 55 economic sectors 
within our seven energy and land-use systems—power, industry, mobility, buildings, 
agriculture, forestry and other land use, and waste—could be. We did this analysis using four 
metrics. These are, first, each sector’s direct scope 1 emissions, which indicate exposure to 
potential demand shifts, spending requirements on physical assets, and cost changes from 
having to alter production processes. Second, the emissions from their products, which 
indicates exposure to shifts in demand—for example, if consumers shift their preferences, 
thereby potentially influencing capital spending and costs. Third, supply chain emissions, 
which may expose the sector to cost shifts as its core inputs are affected by the transition. 
And fourth, emissions from purchased electricity, which could indirectly expose the sector to 
the effects of changes in the world’s energy mix.154 In each case, emissions were normalized 
based on the output of the sector. We also added up these metrics to create an overall 
exposure score, an indicator of the overall life-cycle emissions intensity of the sector.

A key finding that emerges from this analysis is that sectors with the highest degree of 
exposure account for about 20 percent of global GDP. These are sectors that directly emit 
significant quantities of greenhouse gases, such as the coal and gas power sector (“emitters 
in core operations”), or that sell products that emit greenhouse gases when used, such as the 
fossil fuel sector (“producers of fossil fuel energy” and “producers of fossil fuel–dependent 
products”). Another approximately 10 percent of GDP is in sectors with high-emissions 
supply chains, such as construction. The remaining 70 percent of GDP is generated by 
sectors that have less direct exposure but are nonetheless dependent on the more exposed 
sectors through interconnected economic and financial systems, and thus could be indirectly 
affected.155 The heat map in Exhibit 14 highlights the types of exposure for the 25 most 
exposed sectors. 

153 The NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario contains detailed data for some but not all of the seven energy and land-use systems. 
Where necessary, we collaborated with Vivid Economics to create sector-specific decarbonization pathways that were 
consistent with the broader NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. See the technical appendix for details.

154 The second point on emissions from products concerns downstream scope 3 emissions. The third point, on supply 
chain emissions, relates to upstream scope 3 emissions. The fourth point on electricity emissions relates to scope 2 
for electricity use. For purposes of this research “scope 1” emissions are direct greenhouse emissions that occur from 
sources that are controlled or owned by an organization; “scope 2” emissions are associated with the purchase of 
electricity, steam, heat, or cooling. “Scope 3” emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled 
by the reporting organization but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain; thus scope 3 emissions 
result from emissions across an organization’s value chain that are not within the organization’s scope 1 and 2 boundary. 
See Greenhouse gases at EPA, United States Environmental Protection Agency. Similar definitions can also be applied 
when considering the scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions for a sector. See the technical appendix for details of methodology and 
metrics in the estimate.

155 Other higher-order effects not considered here, for example, impacts on financial asset valuations, could increase the 

exposure of some of these latter sectors.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringAs part of this analysis, we also gauged the vulnerability of a sector’s workforce to the net-
zero transition. We compared overall emissions intensity across the categories described 
previously, which provides an indication of which sectors may be more prone to employment 
shifts and transformations from the transition, with its GDP per worker, which serves as a 
proxy for sector profits and wages, and thus the ability of workers to adjust financially to the 
transition. From this analysis, we see that 10 of the 55 sectors have relatively high exposure 
to the transition and relatively low GDP per worker. Some 15 percent of GDP is in these 
sectors, which include agriculture, forestry, cement, automotive, and land transportation 
(Exhibit 15). An additional nine sectors have high transition exposure and relatively high 
GDP per worker. These sectors account for approximately 11 percent of GDP and include 
extraction and refining of fossil fuels, power, and chemicals. While workers in these sectors 
may be better prepared financially to adjust to the transition, they too may require varying 
degrees of support, based on the nature of their skills and ability to transition to other areas of 
the economy.

Below we illustrate how the transition could play out in the energy and land-use systems 
through eight deep dives into fossil fuels and new sectors including hydrogen and biofuels, 
power, industry (steel and cement), road mobility, buildings, food and agriculture, and forestry 
and other land use. The organization of this system view largely follows the energy and land-
use systems framework used above, with two changes: we do not include the waste system, 
and we break out fossil fuels, hydrogen, and biofuels as a separate category because of their 
cross-cutting nature. The infographic accompanying each section contains charts illustrating 
the most relevant of the economic shifts that we examined in detail, namely demand, capital 
spending, costs, and jobs.

1.  Sector GDP per worker is based on dividing the sector's GDP by the respective sector's jobs. Sector GDP is the sum of the sector's GDP in the 69 countries in our 

analysis; sector jobs is the sum of the sector's jobs in the 69 countries in our analysis. Emissions intensity is calculated using CO₂-equivalent emissions, and takes into 
account CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O. These gases are converted to CO₂ equivalent using the GWP100 methodology.

toward low-carbon energy sources

Combustion of fossil fuels produces 83 percent of global CO₂ emissions. Four percent of 
global CO₂ emissions and 33 percent of methane come from fossil fuel extraction.156 The Net 
Zero 2050 scenario analyzed here foresees a significant reduction in the use of fossil fuels as 
the use of other energy sources increases (Exhibit 16).157 At the same time, this would create 
opportunities for alternate energy carriers including hydrogen and biofuels. 

Paths to decarbonization. For fossil fuel production, a key decarbonization action would 
entail reductions in emissions from operations. Energy-efficiency improvement is one 
element of this approach: McKinsey research has found that a 10 percent increase in oil 
and gas production efficiency can deliver a 4 percent reduction in emissions intensity.158 
Electrifying the equipment used in extraction and refining would help decarbonize these 
activities, provided that the electricity came from zero-emissions sources.159 In addition, fossil 
fuel producers could manage fugitive methane emissions with equipment such as vapor-
recovery units and practices such as proactive leak detection. Finally, carbon capture and 
storage could be used to reduce the emissions from oil and gas processes that produce highly 
concentrated streams of CO₂. Captured CO₂ could be reinjected into oil reservoirs, increasing 
the efficiency of oil production through a process called enhanced oil recovery.160 

Shifts in demand, capital spending, costs, and jobs. Beyond decarbonization of fossil fuel 
production and direct emissions, a key implication of the net-zero transition examined here 
would be a potential shift in the energy mix—specifically, a reduction in demand for fossil fuels 
and growing demand for other energy sources such as electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels 
(see Box 5, “Prospects for hydrogen and biofuels in the net-zero transition”). Compared to 
today, oil and gas production volumes in 2050 in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario would be 
55 percent and 70 percent lower, respectively, and coal production for energy use would be 
all but eliminated.161

Our analysis shows that by 2050, the transition described by the Net Zero 2050 scenario 
could lead to about 33 million fewer direct and indirect operations and maintenance jobs in 
the primary energy industry and its supply chain.162 These job losses are concentrated in fossil 
fuel production (13 million from coal mining, eight million from oil and gas extraction, 12 million 
from petroleum refinement and coke production).163 Because many of these jobs are located 
near existing deposits and infrastructure, a decline in demand would have a disproportionate 
impact on specific communities.

This research does not take a position on the feasibility, likelihood, or nature of a 1.5°C path. Instead, we seek to 
demonstrate the shifts that would need to take place if the goal of 1.5 degrees is to be attainable, and a relatively orderly 
transition achieved. It is based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2), which limits global 
warming to 1.5°C “through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net-zero CO₂ emissions around 2050, giving 
at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5°C by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot.” 
While high-emissions activities fall rapidly and steeply during the scenario, they do not necessarily reach net zero in all 
sectors. Residual CO₂ emissions from these activities are counterbalanced by removals. In some cases, variables were 
downscaled by Vivid Economics to provide more sector granularity, which we often continue to refer to as being based on 
or consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. See the technical appendix for further details.

a loss or a gain if it involves a shift in sector or subsector for a worker, indicating a changing job function, or a change in the

indirect jobs, we exclude a set of sectors for which we have done bottom-up calculations elsewhere, including 
agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining and extraction of energy; coke and refined petroleum, other nonmetallic mineral 
products, manufacture of basic metals, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; power; machinery, and equipment 
and construction. We do this to avoid double counting our job impacts. The indirect jobs shifts would be about 15 to 
25 percent higher if all upstream sectors are considered, without netting out the job changes from other modeled sectors.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringBox 5

Prospects for hydrogen and biofuels in the net-zero transition 

The net-zero transition will lead to the increased uptake of new energy carriers, specifically hydrogen, biofuels, and 
biomass. These industries may be centered in regions with considerable sunlight, wind, or sources of biomass.

Hydrogen. In the net-zero transition, hydrogen could serve many purposes—for example, as an industrial feedstock for 
industry, a fuel, or a chemical for long-term energy storage. In the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, hydrogen production, 
excluding captive production for industrial end uses (for example, refineries, chemical production), would increase more 
than tenfold between now and 2050. 

Currently, hydrogen production mainly involves steam-methane reforming and autothermal reforming technologies—
emissions-intensive processes that result in gray hydrogen. For a net-zero transition, this type of hydrogen would 
be replaced by carbon-neutral green or pink hydrogen. Green hydrogen is made with electrolysis powered by low-
emissions energy, while pink hydrogen is made with electrolysis powered by nuclear energy. Blue hydrogen, produced 
through gray steam-methane and autothermal reforming processes plus carbon capture and storage, can bridge the 
transition to green. 

As the price of low-emissions energy drops, production costs for green hydrogen are likely to decrease, and output 
is likely to grow.1 Recent analysis by the Hydrogen Council in collaboration with McKinsey shows that the production 
costs of green hydrogen could decline 60 percent from 2020 to 2030. At that rate, green hydrogen could reach cost 
parity with traditional production methods by 2028 in regions that are optimal for low-emissions energy production, and 
between 2032 and 2034 in locations with average potential for low-emissions energy—assuming a carbon cost of about 
$50 per metric ton of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e) by 2030, $150 per tCO₂e by 2040, and $300 per tCO₂e by 2050.2 

Our analysis suggests that, in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, expanding capacity for making hydrogen would require 
average annual capital spending of close to $55 billion between now and 2050.3 A substantial number of jobs could be 
created: according to our analysis, hydrogen production could see an increase of approximately five million direct and 
indirect operations and maintenance jobs, with an additional two million jobs related to capital expenditure on hydrogen 
infrastructure by 2050. 

Biofuels and biomass. Biofuels are transportation fuels, such as biodiesel, ethanol and biojet, produced from purpose-
grown agricultural cash crops, and sometimes from agricultural and food sector waste and byproducts. Today, biofuels 
are blended with fossil fuels to make diesel and gasoline. Indeed, hydrogen-based synthetic fuels and biofuels have 
already been approved by aircraft manufacturers for use in aviation, and could also be used in shipping. National 
regulations in individual countries are playing the main role in shaping biofuels markets.

Our analysis suggests that in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, sustainably produced biofuels would reach a material 
share of final energy consumption in 2030. Their production would increase more than tenfold between 2020 and 2050, 
requiring annual average capital spending of about $175 billion. Demand for biomass would increase during the net-zero 
transition, mainly as a result of the uptake of biofuels. How the biomass supply would meet this increased demand is 
unclear. Questions surround the feasibility of producing biomass from waste cycles and the availability of appropriate 
land for growing bioenergy crops. The uptake of biofuels could also lead to about six million direct and indirect O&M 
job gains by 2050, with an additional two million jobs related to capital expenditures associated with the build-out of 
biofuel infrastructure.

1  For example, costs of solar and wind power have decreased by about 80 percent and 40 percent, respectively, in the past decade. See Jason Finkelstein, 

David Frankel, and Jesse Noffsinger, “How to decarbonize global power systems,” McKinsey & Company, May 2020.

2  These costs reflect pure production costs and assume a dedicated renewable and electrolysis system for renewable hydrogen. They do not include costs 

required for baseload supply of hydrogen (for example, storage and buffers) or for redundancies, services, and margins; they also do not include any cost for 
hydrogen transportation and distribution. See Hydrogen insights: A perspective on hydrogen investment, market development and cost competitiveness, 
Hydrogen Council and McKinsey & Company, February 2021.

McKinsey & CompanyFor example, in seven US counties in the states of Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and 
Wyoming, more than 10 percent of workers are employed in coal mining.164 Countries whose 
economies have a large share of economic activity related to fossil fuel production—such 
as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—would also be exposed to such a 
transition (see chapter 4 for details). On average, about 15 percent of GDP in these countries 
involves extracting and refining fossil fuel products. Our analysis also suggests that, in 2050, 
other fuel sectors could see a gain of 11 million direct and indirect O&M jobs as a result of the 
net-zero transition. These job gains are in the biofuels industry and its upstream supply chain 
(six million) and in the hydrogen industry and its supply chain (five million). 

Short-term risks and challenges. As the energy transition unfolds, perhaps the greatest 
challenge will be how to manage the ramping down of high-emitting forms of energy, with 
the ramping up of low-emissions ones, to ensure reliable and affordable energy provision. To 
adjust to the net-zero transition, the world’s biggest fossil fuel producers might consider not 
only decarbonizing their operations, as described above, but also rebalancing their business 
portfolios. More broadly, regions reliant on fossil fuel–based sectors would need to consider 
measures for economic diversification.

Opportunities. As the energy mix shifts in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, our analysis 
suggests that markets for hydrogen and biofuels in particular would expand along with the 
market for zero-emissions electricity. These developments could create possibilities for 
economic development in various geographies. Houston’s largest chamber of commerce, 
the Greater Houston Partnership, has outlined a blueprint for future economic growth that 
identifies opportunities for the city to gain as many as 560,000 additional jobs by leading 
in the energy transition; however, Houston could lose up to 650,000 jobs by taking no 
action by 2050.165 This includes jobs related to solar, wind, hydrogen, CCS, and EVs, among 
others. Many of the world’s leading fossil fuel resource–producing regions, including 
Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, have high solar potential, which 
would be in demand in a net-zero economy. Norway and the United Kingdom have high 
wind power density, which allows countries to generate renewable wind power and green 
hydrogen (see chapter 4).166 The transition toward low-carbon primary energy could create 
growth potential for companies that supply equipment and services to such industries. 
Electrolyzer manufacturers, for example, could see increasing demand for their products, 
given their role in the hydrogen value chain.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringPotential stakeholder responses. Regions whose economic activity now relies heavily on 
fossil fuels may need to invest in low-carbon industries that can power growth and provide 
jobs. For example, Saudi Arabia unveiled plans for one of the world’s largest green-hydrogen 
projects in 2020.167 The Greater Houston Partnership’s report, mentioned above, calls for 
Houston to develop emerging technologies such as CCS, low-carbon hydrogen, and energy 
storage; attract companies in “new energy” industries; and support capital spending in a 
broad range of energy value chains—an agenda that takes advantage of the region’s technical 
workforce, energy and transportation infrastructure, and other attributes.168

In some regions, economic-diversification programs would likely require targeted adjustment 
financing from governments or multilateral institutions. Another important adjustment would 
be reskilling and redeploying workers. The Scottish government, for example, invested in 
retraining and reskilling workers in the oil and gas sector as North Sea oil production declined, 
enabling 89 percent of participants to find new jobs after completing the program.169 

McKinsey research suggests that oil and gas companies are adapting to the net-zero 
transition by following one of three courses.170 Some are becoming resource specialists by 
focusing on improving their capital returns and operating performance while reducing and 
offsetting their operational emissions. Others are seeking to become diversified energy 
players; for example, BP announced a plan to increase its low-carbon spending tenfold by 
2030.171 Finally, some oil and gas companies are turning themselves into low-carbon pure 
plays by divesting legacy high-carbon portfolios and investing in new low-carbon businesses.

McKinsey & CompanyPower: A major expansion of renewable and other low-emissions 
capacity would bring investment opportunities, but the risk of rising 
delivered costs of electricity and volatility would need to be managed 

The NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario envisions widespread electrification that would happen as 
fossil fuels are replaced with electric power. This, along with population growth and increased 
energy access, would substantially lift power consumption relative to today.172 A successful 
transition to net zero for the power system would require a scale-up of renewable and other, 
low-emissions power generation to meet increased demand for electricity. While this would 
bring capital spending opportunities, it would also raise risks of asset stranding (Exhibit 17). 
The challenge of rising energy costs and securing reliable power would also need to be 
effectively managed. 

Paths to decarbonization. Globally, the power system accounts for 12.9 GtCO₂ per year, 
about 30 percent of all CO₂ emissions.173 Decarbonization would involve replacing fossil fuel 
plants for power generation with low-emissions sources, for example, solar, wind, or nuclear. 
The growth of renewables like solar and wind raises the question of how to deal with their daily 
and seasonal intermittency and ensure reliability (reliability more broadly for transmission and 
distribution will become increasingly important as a much larger portion of energy production 
shifts toward the power system). Some fossil fuel plants would remain in use to ensure 
flexibility of the grid, which would need to go hand-in-hand with storage technologies, the 
use of carbon capture, utilization, and storage, and power-to-gas-to-power conversions, as 
well as demand management and long-distance interconnections to pool renewable assets 
across a larger geographic area.174 Another consideration would be managing the physical 
footprint of renewable technologies, which is much higher than that of traditional fossil fuels.175

Shifts in demand, capital spending, costs, and jobs. In the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, 
power generation would scale substantially and roughly double compared with today. The 
greatest increases in demand would be in sub-Saharan Africa (a sevenfold increase compared 
with today), India (fourfold), and emerging markets in Asia (threefold). About 95 percent of 
electricity generation in this scenario in 2050 would come from sources other than fossil 
fuel combustion. 

Increasing power generation in line with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario would require 
annual capital spending on physical assets from 2021 to 2050 that we estimate at about 
$1 trillion in power generation, $820 billion in the power grid, and $120 billion in energy 
storage. This is more than twice today’s spending.176 The increase stems from higher 
electrification needs of the economy because of growth as well as the net-zero transition, and 
from investment in a system which is moving from high fuel-driven variable costs to one which 
is dominated by capital deployment with relatively low operating expenses.

Asset stranding could be large. The risk of asset stranding may be especially acute in China 
and India, which have coal plants that are less than 15 years old on average (compared with 
over 30 years old in the United States).177 Our analysis of the scenario suggests that about 

172 The analysis in this deep dive is focused on a hypothetical path and is not meant to serve as a projection or prediction. 

This research does not take a position on the feasibility, likelihood, or nature of a 1.5°C path. Instead, we seek to 
demonstrate the shifts that would need to take place if the goal of 1.5 degrees is to be attainable, and a relatively orderly 
transition achieved. It is based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2), which limits global

at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5°C by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot.” 
While high-emissions activities fall rapidly and steeply during the scenario, they do not necessarily reach net zero in all 
sectors. Residual CO₂ emissions from these activities are counterbalanced by removals. In some cases, variables were 
downscaled by Vivid Economics to provide more sector granularity, which we often continue to refer to as being based on 
or consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. See the technical appendix for further details.

power industry: Evaluating two decarbonization scenarios,” McKinsey & Company, February 2020.

175 Current power technologies such as coal and gas require about 12 acres per megawatt of power generation. In contrast, 
solar and wind power require approximately 43 and 71 acres of land per megawatt, respectively. Thus, switching to wind 
and solar power would likely increase land use by a factor of three to six. See The footprint of energy and land use of US 
electricity production, Strata, 2017.

176 Spending may be even higher than sized here, for example if additional investment is needed to maintain flexibility and 

redundancy.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring$2.1 trillion of the sector’s capital stock could be stranded by 2050.178 Eighty percent of 
this amount is today’s capacity, and 20 percent is capacity that would be built between 
2020 and 2050. 

Another key challenge to be managed is the effect of the power transition on the delivered 
cost of electricity. Even under a relatively orderly transition, the scenario modeled here 
finds that capital spending to replace fossil fuel power capacity and build out transmission, 
distribution, and storage capacity to improve grid reliability and flexibility would increase the 
global average delivered cost of electricity in the near term. We estimate that the fully loaded 
unit cost of electricity production across generation, transmission, distribution, and storage 
would increase about 25 percent by 2040 from 2020 levels (including operating costs, 
capital costs, and depreciation of existing and new assets).179 This is for two main reasons: 
firstly, investments will be needed in grid and storage capacity, creating capital costs and 
depreciation charges. Secondly, some fossil-based power assets would continue to incur 
capital costs, even if they are underutilized or retired prematurely.

Cost increases could be even larger and more volatile than estimated here, for example if 
grid flexibility is not well managed and power generation is insufficient to meet demand, or 
if young fossil fuel assets need to be abruptly retired. Substantial near-term risk will need to 
be managed to ensure that energy prices for consumers do not rise and create affordability 
issues.180 In the long run, there is more uncertainty on the outlook for costs. The delivered 
cost of electricity could well be lower than 2020 levels given the lower operating costs for 
generation from renewables, depending on innovations in grid design and evolution of the 
power system to manage flexibility issues. It is also important to note that the delivered cost 
of electricity as sized here is not the same as consumer electricity prices, as discussed also in 
chapter 2. This analysis represents a global average perspective. The picture could look quite 
different across regions depending on the current state of their power system, age of fossil 
power fleets, and availability of natural resources like sunshine and wind, among other factors.

Our analysis suggests that approximately six million direct jobs would be added in 
operations and maintenance for renewable power and approximately four million direct 
jobs would be lost in fossil fuel–based power under a net-zero transition by 2050.181 

178 Based on cumulative value of prematurely retired and underutilized assets from 2020 to 2050, undiscounted. 

We estimate it by first identifying the level of yearly depreciation that is expected given asset life and assumed economic 
life using data from the WRI Global Power Plant database as input. That figure was multiplied by the fraction of assets 
that are underutilized relative to past average utilization rates (between 2005 and 2020) and summed across years. We 
use this approach based on the age of the asset and its utilization (similar to a book value approach) to capture the effect 
of the production dynamics shifting, rather than any market dynamics or other factors. Other research has found similar 
effects on the power sector. See, for example, Stranded assets and renewables: How the energy transition affects the 
value of energy reserves, buildings and capital stock, International Renewable Energy Agency, 2017; and David Nelson 
et al., Moving to a low-carbon economy: The impact of policy pathways on fossil fuel asset values, Climate Policy Initiative, 
October 2014.

179 To assess cost changes for power, we first quantified the change in three main cost drivers: power generation capital 
charge and depreciation (at a weighted average cost of capital of 6.5 percent), power generation operating costs, and 
transmission, distribution, and storage investments. These were then translated into a delivered cost of electricity by 
dividing by electricity production in each time period. This metric indicates how the underlying costs are changing for 
the entire power sector. Our methodology is broader than other studies focused on the levelized cost of energy for new 
assets which often highlight the competitive cost position of renewables in the power mix. Our analysis also takes into

retired or underutilized. See also Rupert Way et al., Empirically grounded technology forecasts and the energy transition, 
Institute for New Economic Thinking Oxford, working paper number 2021-01, September 2021. Note that our metric is 
different from the actual cost paid by consumers, and eventual energy prices for consumers could look substantially 
different. Consumer electricity prices depend on a multitude of factors, including decisions on how the power system 
transformation is paid for and over what time frame. For example, a key question is how to best manage coal generation 
decommissioning and write-down costs. Moreover not all expected changes in delivered costs are due to decarbonization. 
For instance, some transmission and distribution investments would happen regardless, as countries increase electricity 
access. This analysis does not take into account short-term variations in supply and demand, subsidies, or taxes.

25 percent higher if all upstream sectors are considered, without netting out the job changes from other modeled sectors.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringA massive power-infrastructure build-out could result in a gross gain of about 27 million direct 
jobs in construction, manufacturing, and upstream sectors by 2030, slowing to a gain of 
approximately 16 million direct jobs by 2050. 

Short-term risks and challenges. Lack of system resiliency due to insufficient flexible 
generation, land constraints for permitting renewables, coupled with the scale-up of power 
demand from buildings and mobility could disrupt the power system. Securing reliable access 
to power will be a key imperative for the sector. Asset impairment could also be substantially 
higher under a delayed and abrupt transition, if new fossil-power assets are built that then 
need to be prematurely retired or underutilized.

Opportunities. The power sector holds some of the largest opportunities for value creation, 
given the expansion and capital spending expected in the sector. Opportunities would 
arise not only for low-emissions power producers but also for providers of low-emissions 
generation equipment, electricity-storage hardware, and related services. This includes 
solar-panel and wind-turbine manufacturers, battery manufacturers, companies involved in 
extracting and refining minerals needed for batteries and solar panels (for example, lithium, 
rare-earth elements, copper, and nickel), and construction and other companies responsible 
for building and operating new generation capacity and transmission and distribution 
networks. Finance providers and companies offering project development support for 
the influx of new low-emissions projects required over the next decade could also see 
opportunities. Finally, companies that develop technologies to enable grid expansion, grid 
integration, and flexibility solutions for power (for example, power system integration) could 
also see increased demand for their products. 

Potential stakeholder responses. Several measures could help facilitate the reallocation 
of capital toward low-emissions power generation. Some regions have established multiyear 
energy strategies that include targets for retiring fossil fuel plants and compensation 
programs for the owners of these assets, which may result in these costs not being reflected 
in customers’ bills.182 Incentives could also help in markets where low-emissions sources 
would not be cost competitive with conventional sources. 

Managing up-front capital spending on physical assets and delivered cost of electricity 
increases is another consideration. Short-term increases in energy prices could prove 
challenging for lower-income consumers, many of whom spend more of their income on 
energy than other households, even though they consume less energy per capita.183 Various 
social support schemes could mitigate impacts of rising energy prices, either directly with 
subsidies or by assisting households with installation of rooftop solar power, battery systems, 
and other equipment to minimize their grid-connection charges. 

Finally, continued technological and market innovation would be needed to manage grid 
intermittency and ensure reliability. Enabling the electricity grid to accommodate significantly 
more renewable energy would likely require continued innovation of storage technologies. It 
would also entail thoughtful grid design and require interconnection and system-balancing 
coordination among grid operators to balance demand and supply, for example, between 
generators and grid operators. Managing intermittency would also require continued 
innovation on the demand side—for example, by modulating load through demand response 
and management as adoption of distributed energy resources (for example, small-scale solar, 
energy storage, and controllable appliances) increases. This would require capital spending 
on grid modernization technologies from utilities (advanced metering infrastructure and 
distributed-energy-resource-management systems) and broad uptake of updated utility rate 
structures to reward demand-side measures.

McKinsey & CompanySteel industry: Investing in low-emissions production while managing 
higher costs 

Steel occupies an essential place in modern life as one of the most important materials 
for construction, equipment and machinery, and durable goods. Globally, steel production 
accounts for 3.4 GtCO₂ per year, about 8 percent of all CO₂ emissions.184 Production of 
a metric ton of steel results in 1.8 metric tons of CO₂ emissions on average.185 Efforts to 
decarbonize steelmaking operations would require capital spending to retrofit production 
assets or replace them with alternatives that emit less CO₂. Decarbonization could potentially 
increase production costs by about 30 percent by 2050 compared with today, according 
to our analysis, which is based on a scenario consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 
scenario (Exhibit 18).186 To adjust to the transition, steel producers would need to assess their 
emissions, identify a net-zero strategy, engage with the broader ecosystem, and decide on 
a technologically and economically viable way to decrease their carbon footprint.187

Paths to decarbonization. Nearly three-quarters of crude steel today is made from iron 
ore in blast furnace–basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) plants. These plants release carbon 
when coking coal is burned and used as a reducing agent. Reducing emissions would require 
providing the high-temperature heat that is essential in steelmaking as well as mitigating 
process emissions from the steel-reducing process. However, while several promising 
alternation technology options exist, there is still uncertainty over the ultimate preferred 
route. One key decarbonization action could be replacing blast furnaces with electric arc 
furnaces; powering EAFs with 100 percent carbon-neutral electricity would eliminate energy-
related emissions.188 However, process emissions associated with feedstock would also need 
to be abated. Feedstock for EAFs consists of either scrap-based steel—the increased use 
of which would reduce emissions—pig iron, or direct reduced iron. Availability of scrap would 
limit the extent to which scrap-based EAF can be used. Today, natural gas is used in the direct 
reduction of iron, but if green hydrogen made with renewable power were used instead, this 
process would be close to emissions free. Another option involves using carbon capture, 
utilization, and storage with traditional steelmaking techniques, although this approach 
remains technologically premature and has yet to be proven economically.189

Shifts in demand, capital spending, and costs. In the net-zero scenario analyzed here, 
global demand for steel would increase modestly and be about 10 percent higher in 2050 
than today. In some cases, downstream users of steel may try to reduce their supply-chain 
emissions and seek alternative materials, such as cross-laminated timber in buildings 
and construction. However, the bigger shift is likely to be related to the mix of production, 
which would substantially change, with low-carbon steel rising from almost one-quarter 
of all production to almost all production by 2050.190 EAF would be the main mode of steel 
production by 2050, accounting for nearly 65 percent of overall output. BF-BOF plants would 
still account for the remaining 35 percent of steel production. Most of this production would 
be decarbonized by installing CCS equipment. There is, however, some uncertainty in these 
estimates as to which technologies will prevail.

186 The analysis in this deep dive is focused on a hypothetical path and is not meant to serve as a projection or prediction. 

This research does not take a position on the feasibility, likelihood, or nature of a 1.5°C path. Instead, we seek to 
demonstrate the shifts that would need to take place if the goal of 1.5 degrees is to be attainable, and a relatively orderly 
transition achieved. It is based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2), which limits global 
warming to 1.5°C “through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net-zero CO₂ emissions around 2050, giving 
at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5°C by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot.” 
While high-emissions activities fall rapidly and steeply during the scenario, they do not necessarily reach net zero in all 
sectors. Residual CO₂ emissions from these activities are counterbalanced by removals. In this and some other cases, 
variables were downscaled by Vivid Economics to provide more sector granularity, which we often continue to refer to as 
being based on or consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. See the technical appendix for further details.
187 While this discussion is focused on the emissions reduction in the steel manufacturing process, the upstream mining 
industry that produces the inputs to the steelmaking process also generates emissions and has additional important 
considerations in the social and governance impacts of these processes. That is, however, outside the scope of this 
analysis.

emissions further to possibly <0.3 t/t Scope 1 & 2 CO₂.

McKinsey & CompanyThis is based on downscaling of the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario; other scenarios may 
expect a smaller role for BF-BOF production with CCS in the long run, and a bigger role 
instead for EAF than described here.

Meeting this demand while remaining within emissions limits via low-emissions production 
routes would require cumulative capital spending of about $4.4 trillion over the next 30 years, 
an annual average of about $145 billion per year. Approximately one-quarter of the capital 
spending in the Net Zero 2050 scenario would be used to retrofit existing BF-BOFs with CCS 
technology. For hydrogen-based DRI, further capital spending would be required to scale 
production of green hydrogen and to build out pipeline infrastructure. 

In this scenario, our analysis suggests that steel production costs would increase by about 
30 percent in 2050 compared with today.191 Most of the increase would result from the 
higher operating costs associated with CCS and hydrogen-based DRI. These cost increases 
are sensitive to the extent to which costs of green hydrogen production can be lowered, 
and innovation could lower the estimates sized here. The rise in production costs may 
have potential knock-on price impacts on a range of consumer and industrial goods, from 
refrigerators to heavy machinery. The size of the potential impacts will depend on the share of 
steel intermediate inputs in the final product.  

Short-term risks and challenges. As discussed above, uncertainty still remains on the 
eventual route for steel decarbonization. Factors such as the cost evolution of hydrogen and 
CCS routes as well as variations across regions could influence the pathway taken. A key 
challenge for steel producers will also be managing any cost increases they may experience 
as a result of the net-zero transition.

Opportunities. Depending on the premium that customers are willing to pay for low-
emissions steel—and on the evolution of regulation involving, for example, carbon prices—
low-emissions steel producers could gain a competitive advantage in a net-zero transition. 
Other players in the steelmaking ecosystem also stand to benefit from a shift toward 
low-carbon steel production. For example, companies that supply feedstock, equipment, 
and energy for EAF and DRI-EAF production (including steel scrap, beneficiated iron ore, 
pelletizing equipment, low-emissions power, hydrogen electrolyzers, and green hydrogen) 
could see increased demand. Demand for related services, such as construction and 
maintenance of CCS solutions and maintenance of DRI-EAF facilities, could also rise.

Potential stakeholder responses. The shift to hydrogen-based steel relies in part on the 
broad availability of green hydrogen on an industrial scale. However, green hydrogen is 
expensive today. To be cost competitive with current fuels, estimates suggest its cost would 
need to fall more than 60 percent.192 Scaling up hydrogen production would require close 
coordination between steelmakers and the hydrogen and power sectors. 

The economics of decarbonized steel production are likely to be influenced by incentives in 
the form of government-led policy measures such as carbon pricing and carbon border taxes. 
Steelmakers could work with regulators to ensure support for decarbonization spending 
that would help to preserve local jobs and meet growing demand for low-emissions steel. 
Governments could also consider the use of subsidies and loans to help steelmakers with the 
up-front capital expenditures associated with the use of hydrogen-based DRI and CCS.193 
These actions would help stimulate demand for low-carbon steel. Incentives may also come 
from the financial sector, if the cost of financing for low-emissions technology falls. Steel 
consumers may also provide the right incentives by demonstrating a willingness to pay the 
higher costs of low-carbon steel. Already, various auto manufacturers for example, have 
announced plans to eliminate carbon emissions from their value chains.194 The shift toward 
net-zero steel production would thus likely depend on a collaborative effort among regulators, 
governments, and industry stakeholders to change the economics of production, facilitate 
access to required capital, and stimulate demand.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringCement industry: Managing higher costs and shifts in demand

Cement production accounts for emissions of 2.6 GtCO₂ per year, or roughly 6 percent of 
the global total, placing the industry among the highest-emitting industrial sectors.195 About 
40 percent of the emissions from cement production come from the fossil fuels used to power 
the precalciners and kilns in cement plants. The rest comes from the chemical process of 
calcination.196 The scenario modeled here, consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, 
suggests that decarbonization of cement would entail capital spending and higher operating 
costs (Exhibit 19). Opportunities could arise across the low-emissions cement industry and its 
value chain as well as in the markets and value chains for alternative materials.197

Paths to decarbonization. Today, the decarbonization pathway for the cement sector may 
be less technologically certain than for other sectors. If used together, several established 
techniques have the potential to cut emissions from cement production.198 Energy-efficiency 
measures would focus on kilns, which consume about 90 percent of the energy used in 
cement manufacturing. Switching to alternative fuels, such as biomass, would also lower 
emissions because they are less carbon-intensive than fossil fuels, although their use 
depends on availability and local supply chains. Cement production could be decarbonized 
further with measures to alter the composition of cement or concrete. Clinker, an intermediate 
input, could be replaced with materials that release no CO₂, such as natural and calcined 
pozzolans, or industrial byproducts such as fly ash and blast-furnace slag.199 

That said, traditional levers alone will only likely allow the cement and concrete industry to 
contribute about one-third of the reduction in emissions required to limit warming across 
the economy to 1.5°C, and so various other innovative technologies would be needed.200 
Collectively, these represent approaches to reduce emissions, redesign buildings and 
infrastructure, and repurpose the carbon dioxide produced in the construction process.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage, used today in just a handful of commercial pilot 
plants, could be a potential solution.201 Carbon curing could also be used to sequester CO₂ 
in concrete.202 Recycling technologies can also be used to reduce the carbon footprint of 
concrete. Recycled concrete paste can be carbonated with CO₂ from flue gas and used as 
supplementary cementitious material.

201 This method isolates and collects carbon dioxide from exhaust vents and either recycles it for further industrial use (for 

example, in the production of glass and plastics) or safely stores it underground. While still relatively nascent, expanding 
the scale of CCS would depend on the economics of storing and sequestering carbon, regulation, and the availability of 
customers for captured CO₂.

202 This technology injects CO₂ captured during cement production to accelerate the curing process and “lock in” CO₂ in the 
end product. Current low-carbon cement technologies can sequester up to 5 percent of CO₂, with the potential of 30 
percent. For details, see Thomas Czigler, Sebastian Reiter, Patrick Schulze, and Ken Somers, “Laying the foundation for

McKinsey & CompanyReducing demand for cement through the collection and recycling of concrete waste is 
another way to lower emissions. Given its performance characteristics and the widespread 
availability of raw materials, cement-based concrete would remain a preferred construction 
material globally. However, over time, other materials could play a role. The adoption 
of alternate building materials such as cross-laminated timber, for example, could be a 
pathway to reduce emissions, though uncertainty remains about how much of a role they 
can play.203 Alternative insulation materials such as double-glazed tinted glass, advanced 
insulation foam, as well as entirely new technologies like biocement, created from naturally 
grown materials, are also being considered. Other potential shifts include the application of 
modular construction methods and building information modeling systems, which can enable 
more efficient construction and reduce the need for cement and concrete.204

Shifts in demand, capital spending, and costs. In the net-zero scenario examined here, 
demand for cement would be about 6 percent higher in 2050 than today but would shift 
toward the low-emissions techniques described above. 

Our analysis suggests that the industry would require capital spending on physical assets of 
about $60 billion on average per year over the next 30 years in the Net Zero 2050 scenario 
to build low-emissions production capacity and add CCS equipment to existing plants. 
Separately, large spending on infrastructure, such as pipelines and tanks to collect CO₂ and 
store or deliver it to customers, would also be necessary.

These decarbonization measures could make an average metric ton of cement approximately 
45 percent more expensive in the net-zero scenario than today. The production cost of 
cement would go up because CCS would add operating costs and require up-front capital 
expenditures. There could be wide regional variations in these costs, depending on the 
economics of CCS and other factors; for example, biomass could also become scarcer as a 
result of rising demand from other industries. Innovation could also lower the estimates here.

The economics of emissions abatement could be improved by bringing down the costs of CCS 
and increase the availability of alternative fuels and clinker substitutes, for example via local 
regulations. Regulatory differences in carbon prices, which our analysis does not include, 
could also have a significant influence on whether a metric ton of cement becomes more or 
less expensive during the net-zero transition than it would have been otherwise. 

Short-term risks and challenges. As discussed above, uncertainty still remains on the 
eventual route for cement decarbonization. A key challenge for cement producers will also be 
managing any cost increases they may experience as a result of the net-zero transition.

Opportunities. The net-zero transition could create opportunities to develop low-emissions 
cement, including more broadly across the ecosystem, depending on how regulations and 
customer and investor preferences evolve.205 Products such as carbon-cured concrete, for 
example, could justify the cost of a green premium among environmentally conscious buyers. 
Producers of alternative materials could also see demand go up if construction companies 
look to replace cement in buildings and other structures. New opportunities could also 
include prefabrication, modular housing, and building information management services. 
Low-emissions cement requires different feedstock and clinker substitutes, alternate energy 
sources including biomass, and new equipment, mainly related to CCS. Among others, 
companies that produce recycled material from construction and demolition waste, 
increasingly used, could see rising demand.

McKinsey & CompanyPotential stakeholder responses. Given the nature of the cement industry, and the 
decarbonization actions involved, the entire ecosystem would need to participate. 
This includes governments and regulators, customers, investors, developers and owners 
of projects, construction companies, providers to new technologies like alternate building 
materials, and, finally, cement producers. Broader stakeholders in the ecosystem 
would need to play a role to create the right conditions and incentives to help support 
decarbonization efforts. 

Governments can consider various incentives to improve the economics of decarbonized 
cement. These include subsidies to compensate for the large up-front capital expenditures 
required to decarbonize, as well as R&D investment to bring down the costs of CCS, 
alternative fuels, and low-emissions production methods. Regulations on CO₂ emissions 
could also affect the relative costs of conventional and low-emissions cement. Because 
cement markets are local, local policies will likely be differentiators. A key challenge for many 
potential decarbonization technologies will be applying them at industrial scale. The cement 
industry is distributed across many players, and many innovations are still in the prototype 
or pilot stage. Getting decarbonization technologies to industrial scale will require sufficient 
capital spending (including venture capital and private equity funds) to drive R&D and support 
large-scale rollout. 

For companies, a combination of individual initiatives and collective action could help lessen 
the impacts of the net-zero transition. To manage their exposure to cost and demand shifts, 
companies might build road maps of actions they might take under different scenarios, 
pursue technological advancements to help drive down costs, and rethink their products 
and portfolios. Industry platforms can help companies align their actions and jointly pursue 
innovations that could benefit them all. More broadly, new partnerships with innovators and 
suppliers will be crucial to securing new forms of low-emissions inputs and driving innovation.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringMobility: Shifting to low-emissions vehicles and managing up-front 
capital costs and job reallocation 

The movement of people and goods by land, air, and sea is vital to the international 
economy. Most of this activity is powered by fossil fuels. Mobility accounts for emissions of 
approximately 8.1 GtCO₂ per year, or 19 percent of overall CO₂.206 In this section, we focus 
our analysis on road mobility, the segment of the mobility system that accounts for about 
75 percent of transportation emissions. (For other modes of transportation, see Box 6, 
“The net-zero transition in aviation, shipping, and rail.”) In the mobility scenario modeled here, 
consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, road transportation would undergo a 
substantial shift to battery-electric and fuel cell-electric vehicle sales by 2050.207 This would 
involve a ramp-up in capital spending, job reallocations, and a reduction of passenger vehicle 
total ownership costs over time (Exhibit 20). Companies throughout the mobility system, 
not just OEMs but also suppliers, as well as manufacturers and operators of EV charging 
infrastructure, could tap into the opportunities created by the net-zero transition.

Paths to decarbonization. Decarbonizing road transportation primarily means replacing 
ICE vehicles that run on fossil fuels with those that have low or zero emissions. Battery-
powered electric vehicles are currently a key zero-emissions technology for passenger cars. 
Fuel cell electric vehicles combine hydrogen stored in a tank with oxygen from the air to 
make electricity to power vehicles, with water as a byproduct. Fuel cell technology will likely 
be prominent in trucks with high range requirements. New supply chains and manufacturing 
capabilities would need to be established, especially for batteries. BEVs and FCEVs also 
require corresponding infrastructure: electric charging stations for BEVs and hydrogen 
fueling stations for FCEVs, plus upstream production of electricity and hydrogen. Also 
essential is an increase in the supply of low-emissions electricity and hydrogen (for example, 
green hydrogen), so that tailpipe emissions are not replaced with emissions from elsewhere 
but are eliminated. Other decarbonization actions could include reducing overall private 
vehicle miles, via modal shifts to public transportation and alternative forms of mobility such 
as pooled and shared options. Manufacturers are also considering how to reduce lifecycle 
emissions associated with materials and decarbonize the production processes used to 
make vehicles.208

Shifts in demand, capital spending, costs, and jobs. In the net-zero scenario analyzed in 
this report, sales of low-emissions cars would increase from 5 percent of global new-vehicle 
sales in 2020 to almost 50 percent by 2030, and much higher in some regions such as 
Europe.209 By 2050, they would account for virtually all new car sales in this scenario.210 Similar 
trends would hold true across different categories of road mobility examined here: passenger 
cars, buses, two- and three-wheelers, and trucks. 

The transition of all vehicle types to low-emissions models in the net-zero scenario would 
result in additional capital spending required for companies in the vehicle supply chain and 
for vehicle owners. This spend on new vehicles alone is estimated to be an annual average 
of $3.4 trillion per year over the next three decades in the net-zero scenario. Building out EV 
charging networks and hydrogen distribution and fueling systems would require additional 
annual capital spending of $100 billion over the next 30 years. 

206 EMIT database, McKinsey Sustainability Insights, September 2021. Data for 2019.
207 The analysis in this deep dive is focused on a hypothetical path and is not meant to serve as a projection or prediction. 

This research does not take a position on the feasibility, likelihood, or nature of a 1.5°C path. Instead, we seek to 
demonstrate the shifts that would need to take place if the goal of 1.5 degrees is to be attainable, and a relatively orderly 
transition achieved. It is based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2), which limits global 
warming to 1.5°C “through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net-zero CO₂ emissions around 2050, giving 
at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5°C by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot.” 
While high-emissions activities fall rapidly and steeply during the scenario, they do not necessarily reach net zero in all 
sectors. Residual CO₂ emissions from these activities are counterbalanced by removals. In this and some other cases, 
variables were downscaled by Vivid Economics to provide more sector granularity, which we often continue to refer to as 
being based on or consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. See the technical appendix for further details.

The net-zero transition in aviation, shipping, and rail 

Aviation accounts for approximately 13 percent of transportation emissions, shipping 
represents 11 percent, and rail contributes about 1 percent.1 To reach net-zero emissions, 
these sectors would need to make significant shifts in their assets and operations.

Aviation: Decarbonizing aviation would require switching to aircraft that run on 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the near term. SAF can be produced from sustainable 
feedstock such as forestry waste and other forms of biomass. Because biomass 
production sequesters carbon (subsequently released when biomass-derived fuels are 
burned), SAF could reduce the life cycle emissions of aviation by 70 to 100 percent on a 
net basis, according to some estimates.2 Governments could consider policies to hasten 
the transition to SAF. Many countries have mandated blending of SAF with conventional 
fuel.3 These decarbonization solutions, however, could raise consumer prices; the UK 
Climate Change Committee estimated that SAF with marginal greenhouse gas removals 
could add more than $40 to a return ticket from London to New York.4 In the longer term, 
aircraft that run on electricity and hydrogen could also be developed. This would require 
further research and innovation as well as the build-out of hydrogen infrastructure.

Shipping: The shipping sector can be decarbonized in a similar fashion to aviation: 
with more efficient vessels, sustainable fuels, and eventually zero-emission vessels. 
This shift could be costly, since the price gap between alternative fuels and fossil fuels 
is particularly evident in the shipping sector. And because ships are long-lived capital 
assets (the average age of a merchant vessel is just over 20 years), shipping companies 
have little incentive to replace relatively young assets with lower-emissions models.5 For 
example, in the near term, zero-emissions container shipping fueled by green ammonia 
could be twice as expensive as standard shipping fueled by heavy oil in the Asia-
Europe corridor. However, the extent to which this will flow through to higher costs for 
consumers will likely be country- and product-specific.6 

Rail: Rail transportation emits six to 41 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) per 
passenger kilometer traveled, compared with 150 grams for an economy long-haul flight 
and 255 grams for a domestic flight.7 A shift from other modes of transportation to rail 
would therefore help decarbonize the transportation sector as a whole. The European 
Union, for example, has launched the €450 million Shift2Rail initiative to make rail more 
economical and convenient for passengers by improving technology, interoperability, 
and efficiency.8 Decarbonizing rail transportation would involve phasing out diesel trains 
in favor of electric or hydrogen-fueled trains. Progress varies by geography: the EU has 
electrified more than 50 percent of its railways, compared with less than 1 percent in the 
United States.9

McKinsey & CompanyThe automotive industry’s shift to electrification will disrupt the entire supply chain and 
create a significant change in the market for automotive components. Demand for critical 
components for electrification such as batteries and electric drives would grow, while 
components only used in ICE vehicles such as conventional transmissions, engines, and 
fuel injection systems would see a decline. Specific geographies, for example Germany, 
Japan, Mexico, and South Korea where automotive production is a relatively large share 
of employment, would be exposed to the transition and need to identify how they can best 
capture opportunities. As production shifts toward EVs, trade flows could be reconfigured 
more broadly. Given the weight of EV batteries, their production may be located closer to 
final-assembly locations. Sources of battery minerals are concentrated in a small number 
of countries, where production would need to be scaled up substantially, also opening up 
opportunities (for further details, see chapter 4). 

Consumers would incur higher up-front costs to buy low-emissions vehicles, at least in the 
short term. Today, depending on the country and the size of the vehicle, the up-front cost of 
a battery-electric vehicle is generally about 30 to 90 percent more than that of an internal 
combustion engine car. This gap is expected to narrow over time with lower battery prices.211 
Even with higher upfront costs, consumers would see a benefit over time. McKinsey analysis 
suggests that the total cost to own an EV, which takes into account the purchase price, 
maintenance, fuel cost, and resale value, would be cheaper than an ICE car in most regions 
by 2025, assuming battery costs fall as expected. In contrast, the total cost of ownership for 
an ICE car is expected to increase steadily as fuel prices increase and resale values fall due 
to usage and sale restrictions. There are regional differences: for example, the total cost of 
ownership for battery-electric cars in Europe may be cheaper than ICEs by 2025 and in the 
United States by 2030. Medium-duty BEV trucks covering 200–300 km a day are expected 
to reach total cost parity with ICEs by around 2025, with heavy-duty long-haul trucks 
reaching parity by 2030 in Europe and later in other regions. Faster declines in battery prices 
and local subsidies could accelerate this break-even point.

For workers in the auto industry, our analysis suggests that the transition to low-emissions 
vehicles would result in a reallocation of labor to different activities.212 Today, the broader 
automotive industry employs about 34 million workers across the passenger car value chain, 
including those working directly for automotive OEMs as well as indirectly for upstream 
suppliers (including parts makers, raw materials, and services that support production). 
As a result of the transition described by the Net Zero 2050 scenario, demand for direct 
operations and maintenance jobs in ICE-related vehicle manufacturing could be lower by 
about 13 million by 2050.213 However, demand could increase by about nine million for direct 
O&M jobs related to low-emissions vehicles manufacturing. The difference between losses 
and gains is due to the higher productivity of low-emission vehicle manufacturing. Gains in 
automotive jobs related to capital spending (for example, constructing manufacturing 
plants and charging infrastructure) would be about three million in 2050 under the Net Zero 
2050 scenario. 

211  McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, price benchmarks in key markets.
212 The jobs analysis includes component suppliers, OEMs, maintenance and repair, and vehicle-related infrastructure 

such as filling stations and charging stations. It does not include jobs in primary energy or power; please see the related 
sections of chapter 3 for more about those sectors.

213 Job losses and gains described in this analysis refer to those tied specifically to transition-related changes (for example, 

the shift from fossil fuel energy production to solar, wind, and other renewables). Losses and gains due to macroeconomic 
forces such as income, population, and productivity growth have also been excluded. A job is counted as a loss or a gain 
if it involves a shift in sector or subsector for a worker, indicating a changing job function, or a change in the geography 
of an existing job. O&M jobs consist of those related to the operations and maintenance activities in the sector and their 
supply chains, and include direct and indirect jobs. Indirect jobs are those created in the supply chain of the sector. In 
calculating indirect jobs, we exclude a set of sectors for which we have done bottom-up calculations elsewhere, including 
agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining and extraction of energy; coke and refined petroleum, other nonmetallic mineral 
products, manufacture of basic metals, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; power; machinery, and equipment and 
construction. We do this to avoid double counting our job impacts. The indirect jobs shifts would be about 15 to 25 percent 
higher if all upstream sectors are considered, without netting out the job changes from other modeled sectors. See 
technical appendix for details.

127

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringShort-term risks and challenges. A key challenge for the sector will be ensuring sufficient 
scale-up of production capacity for low-emissions vehicles at the pace needed to drive 
the net-zero transition, including securing the necessary raw materials, as well as building 
support infrastructure such as charging stations. Measures may be needed to support higher 
up-front costs consumers would need to incur (despite longer-term total cost of ownership 
savings). Finally, for economic regions that are reliant on traditional ICE-based production 
jobs, efforts may be needed to help workers adjust.

Opportunities. Prior McKinsey analysis has shown that the shift to low-emissions 
vehicles could create opportunities for companies across the value chain.214 These include: 
manufacturing EV batteries and fuel cells and producing the materials needed to make these 
essential components; building, making, and operating BEV-charging and FCEV-refueling 
infrastructure; and creating digital solutions to integrate the new vehicle energy infrastructure 
with the power grid. The net-zero scenario could also feature a rise in e-hailing and micro 
mobility services (e-bikes and scooters).215

Potential stakeholder responses. Decarbonizing road mobility would likely require 
stakeholder responses to manage the near-term added costs associated with low-emissions 
vehicles. Governments could consider providing financial support for R&D and capital 
spending as well as using regulatory mechanisms. 

Pure EV players have already emerged, and many traditional automotive OEMs have 
announced plans to wind down production of ICE vehicles and ramp up EV production. 
OEMs are already investing in innovation and working closely with new and existing suppliers. 
Reducing material emissions is another opportunity for the automotive industry to help 
reduce overall emissions—potentially through collaborations with other ecosystem players to 
capture abatement opportunities collectively. For example, a coalition of OEMs could harvest 
high-grade aluminum from end-of-life vehicles.216 More broadly, the entire mobility ecosystem, 
from EV manufacturers and suppliers to financers, dealers, energy providers, and charging 
station operators, will need to work to make the transformation successful.

Job transitions in the road mobility sector could require support because making and 
maintaining EVs and ICE vehicles takes different skills. Governments could also consider 
providing workers with various forms of assistance, including help relocating and retraining.

McKinsey & CompanyBuildings: Retrofitting buildings and equipment with low-emissions 
energy sources and raising energy efficiency for new construction

Commercial and residential real estate provides people with shelter and wealth-building 
assets. Heating and cooking in homes, offices, and other buildings create approximately 2.8 
GtCO₂ per year, or 6 percent of global emissions.217 Eliminating these emissions would involve 
two shifts. One would be replacing appliances and heating systems that run on fossil fuels 
with models that run on low- or zero-emissions sources. The other would be improving the 
energy efficiency of buildings and appliances. In the scenario modeled here, consistent with 
the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, these shifts would require significant capital spending 
in the near term that stakeholders would likely need new incentives to make.218 Across 
the buildings sector, companies that offer equipment, services, and financing to enable 
decarbonization could see growth prospects (Exhibit 21). 

Path to decarbonization. Emissions reductions in the buildings sector would be achieved 
by phasing out the use of fossil fuels for cooking and heating in favor of low-emissions 
energy sources such as low-emissions electricity and hydrogen. This would require changes 
to buildings and equipment—for example, replacing gas or oil boilers with electric heat 
pumps, and gas stoves and ovens with electric models. It would also require the build-out of 
infrastructure such as district heating systems that can run on low-emissions sources and 
municipal hydrogen networks.219 Improving the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances 
would also help reduce emissions. Energy efficiency of buildings has increased to some 
extent, although there are still significant opportunities to reduce energy consumption by 
making appliances more efficient and upgrading buildings’ insulation and airflow. McKinsey 
research has found that better insulation can reduce the heat demand of poorly insulated 
houses by up to 80 percent.220 Buildings have long life spans, so the transition would 
involve both retrofitting existing structures and ensuring that new construction generates 
low emissions. 

Shifts in demand, capital spending, costs, and jobs. The scenario analyzed here, 
consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, would involve markedly higher demand 
for, and spending on, low-emissions heating and cooking equipment compared to today. In 
the net-zero scenario, such equipment for both existing and new buildings would exceed 
390 million units by 2050, triple the amount today. As a result, the scenario would require 
increased capital spending estimated at an average of $1.7 trillion per year. 

This spending would be partly offset by the resulting reductions in operating costs. On a 
per-dwelling basis, capital spending would likely fall over time as the costs of low-emissions 
equipment fall with economies of scale. The initial cost of a low-emissions heating system 
today exceeds that of a fossil fuel–based system. Currently, an electric heat pump is up 
to three times more expensive than a gas boiler in some regions for an equivalently sized 
unit.221 However, by 2050, that gap is expected to narrow significantly, because low-carbon

218 The analysis in this deep dive is focused on a hypothetical path and is not meant to serve as a projection or prediction. 

This research does not take a position on the feasibility, likelihood, or nature of a 1.5°C path. Instead, we seek to 
demonstrate the shifts that would need to take place if the goal of 1.5 degrees is to be attainable, and a relatively orderly 
transition achieved. It is based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2), which limits global 
warming to 1.5°C “through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net-zero CO₂ emissions around 2050, giving 
at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5°C by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot.” 
While high-emissions activities fall rapidly and steeply during the scenario, they do not necessarily reach net zero in all 
sectors. Residual CO₂ emissions from these activities are counterbalanced by removals. In this and some other cases, 
variables were downscaled by Vivid Economics to provide more sector granularity, which we often continue to refer to as 
being based on or consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. See the technical appendix for further details.
219 District heating systems are found in various levels around the world and can be powered by both low-emissions sources 
and fossil fuels. The Nordic countries get 65 percent of their heat from district heating. Outside Europe, large district 
heating systems supplied by low-emissions energy are almost nonexistent (in the United States they are heavily based on 
gas, in China mostly from coal). See Dave Keating, “What role can district heating play in the energy transition?” Energy 
Monitor, February 2021. For municipal hydrogen networks, an intermediate step could involve upgrading municipal gas 
networks to blend hydrogen with natural gas to create so-called green gas.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringtechnologies are likely to get less expensive as innovation continues and their production 
scales up. In the net-zero scenario, heat pumps are expected to constitute approximately 
90 percent of new heating unit sales by 2050, compared with 35 percent today. Other moves 
to decarbonize buildings would require capital spending on centralized infrastructure and 
networks. For example, setting up district heating networks requires installing systems 
of insulated pipes to distribute heat as well as building central heating sources in places 
where local supplies of waste heat (such as factories) cannot provide all the heat that 
buildings require.

The extent to which consumers could recuperate higher capital costs through lower operating 
costs in the long run would vary. It will depend on how country-specific relative energy prices 
evolve in the transition and the extent of energy efficiency improvements achieved from 
insulation and newer heating and cooking equipment.222 In some markets, lifetime costs, 
taking into account annualized capital costs and operating costs, are likely already lower for 
low-emissions systems today. 

Our analysis indicates that jobs would be created across the sector as a result of the net-zero 
transition, mainly because of the labor required to perform millions of building retrofits and 
to make and install new low-emissions technologies (for example, installing electric heat 
pumps, adding insulation, and replacing windows). Capital expenditure to develop and install 
additional insulation alone could add four million to six million jobs per year between 2025 and 
2035, when most retrofits would take place. As of 2050, these jobs would diminish to about 
one million per year.223

Short-term risks and challenges. Despite the long-term cost advantages of decarbonizing 
buildings, owners of commercial and residential buildings may lack incentives to invest in 
energy-efficiency improvements or new equipment. In some cases, incentives could be 
split between owners and tenants: owners would pay the up-front capital costs, but tenants 
may enjoy the savings on energy bills. The high up-front capital costs may be particularly 
burdensome for low-income households. In other cases, homeowners may be reluctant to 
accept the inconvenience and expense of making these shifts and retiring young assets that 
have relatively long lives. A multitude of varying building standards and scattered ownership 
could prove challenging, too.

Opportunities. The net-zero transition will create opportunities for companies that support 
the decarbonization of existing building stock. Manufacturers and installers of low-emissions 
and efficiency-enhancing building materials and systems, as well as the services ecosystem 
that manages retrofit projects and maintains these systems, could experience significant 
new demand as the retrofit cycle accelerates. There could also be growth in demand for 
digital systems used to increase the efficiency of buildings and track their energy use and 
greenhouse gas emissions. Because of accelerated retrofits, builders and building owners 
could require more engineering, technology, and performance-management services.

emissions at net-zero cost,” McKinsey & Company, November 2020.

223 Job losses and gains described in this analysis refer to those tied specifically to transition-related changes (for example, 

the shift from fossil fuel energy production to solar, wind, and other renewables). Losses and gains due to macroeconomic 
forces such as income, population, and productivity growth have also been excluded. A job is counted as a loss or a gain 
if it involves a shift in sector or subsector for a worker, indicating a changing job function, or a change in the geography 
of an existing job. O&M jobs consist of those related to the operations and maintenance activities in the sector and their 
supply chains, and include direct and indirect jobs. Indirect jobs are those created in the supply chain of the sector. In 
calculating indirect jobs, we exclude a set of sectors for which we have done bottom-up calculations elsewhere, including 
agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining and extraction of energy; coke and refined petroleum, other nonmetallic mineral 
products, manufacture of basic metals, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; power; machinery, and equipment and 
construction. We do this to avoid double counting our job impacts. The indirect jobs shifts would be about 15 to 25 percent 
higher if all upstream sectors are considered, without netting out the job changes from other modeled sectors. See 
technical appendix for details.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringPotential stakeholder responses. Creative financial structures can help address any 
financing challenges faced by end consumers. Financial institutions could devise products 
that support retrofits or new development of low-emissions buildings that would also help 
them meet their own goals for reducing financed emissions. 

Policy makers have a variety of options for accelerating the net-zero transition in 
the buildings sector. These include providing incentives to banks to finance building 
decarbonization or offer subsidies for retrofits and purchases of electric or low-emissions 
equipment. The US Department of Energy offers energy-efficient mortgages that allow 
buyers to qualify for a more expensive home if the home is energy efficient or will be after 
upgrades. For existing homeowners, the financing program offers home-improvement loans 
that can be used for making energy-efficiency upgrades.224 Policy makers could also consider 
ways of lowering the up-front cost of energy equipment, for example via rebate programs. 
Consumer research by the European Commission also underscores the importance of a 
clear, widespread public-information campaign on the need for change and the ongoing cost 
benefits of switching in the form of lower energy bills.225 Other approaches include amending 
building codes and regulations to let owners retrofit buildings in ways they currently can’t or 
to mandate energy-efficiency standards, including the use of low-emissions equipment, in 
new construction.

McKinsey & CompanyFood and agriculture: Reforming production and changing 
consumption patterns

Food and agriculture contribute substantially to emissions: 140 metric megatons (Mt) of 
methane (38 percent of the world’s total), 0.5 metric gigatons (Gt) of CO₂ (1 percent of global 
CO₂ emissions), and 8 Mt of nitrous oxide (79 percent of global emissions).226 Most farming-
related emissions are caused by methane from production of ruminant livestock, mostly beef 
and lamb (Exhibit 22).227 

Paths to decarbonization. Reducing agricultural emissions would require farmers to 
implement lower-emissions practices and technologies.228 Adopting zero-emissions 
machinery, including tractors, harvesters, and dryers, is a key lever and would also likely 
deliver cost savings.229 In livestock production, farmers could change animal feeding and 
breeding practices, such as using feed additives that inhibit methane emissions.230 Emissions 
reductions can also be achieved in crop production; for example, improved fertilization 
practices can reduce methane emissions from rice cultivation by about 40 percent.231 Better 
fertilizer practices can also help reduce upstream carbon use (during fertilizer production) 
and nitrous oxide emissions. Actions to reduce emissions and increase carbon sequestration 
would also improve resilience to physical climate changes and support economic growth 
and development.232 On the demand side, shifting diets that are currently high in protein 
from ruminant animal products toward plant-based foods or lower-emissions animal protein 
sources such as poultry is another path to reducing emissions. Any such diet shifts would 
need to be balanced with nutritional imperatives: in some parts of the world, raising protein 
consumption—including through the use of ruminant-based protein sources—is vital to 
improving health outcomes for the population.233 Diets are highly personal choices and closely 
linked to local customs and traditions. Improving the availability, quality, and affordability of 
plant-based alternatives and ruminant-meat substitutes could help. Improving supply chains 
and changing consumer behavior would help reduce food waste, thereby cutting emissions by 
reducing the amount of food that needs to be produced. Finally, agriculture also has a broader 
role to play in supporting the net-zero transition through the production of energy crops.

Shifts in demand, capital spending, costs, and jobs. Based on the scenario analyzed here, 
annual capital spending on physical assets of more than $60 billion would be needed over 
the next three decades to enable emissions-efficient farming, including spending on low-
emissions farm equipment and instituting improved farming practices such as efficient use of 
fertilizer and anaerobic digesters.234 The up-front expense for individual farming operations 
could be significant, especially for smallholder farmers.

McKinsey & CompanyIn regard to costs, McKinsey analysis found that 15 of the 25 most promising measures in 
emissions-efficient farming (including zero emissions on-farm machinery and equipment, 
variable rate fertilization, and dry direct seeding) bring long-term cost savings—that is, the 
operating costs outweigh the capital spending required over the long term—or are cost 
neutral to individual farmers.235 However, each measure entails significant up-front costs, 
for example, capital expenditures on equipment and financing of working capital. Other 
challenges include limited access to technology and a lack of scale: smallholdings account for 
three out of four farms around the world. 

More broadly, our analysis of the global agricultural production patterns consistent with the 
net-zero scenario indicates average annual capital spending requirements of $840 billion. 
This is compared to $900 billion under an agriculture scenario in line with the NGFS Current 
Policies scenario. That sees stronger growth in ruminant meat production as consumers 
do not shift their diets and both has a higher emissions intensity and involves higher capital 
expenditures.236 Consumers could see savings from changing diets, since the price per calorie 
of red meat is estimated to be higher, at roughly twice that of poultry, fish, and eggs and more 
than six times higher than that of pulses and nuts.237

As these shifts occur, the nature of jobs within the agricultural sector could be affected. 
Our analysis indicates that about 61 million direct jobs could be created across the sector 
by 2050 as a result of the transition described by the Net Zero 2050 scenario.238 These are 
primarily jobs related to poultry farming as diets shift, and jobs created by increased demand 
for biomass crop production. Our analysis also indicates that about 34 million direct jobs 
could be lost across the sector, primarily in ruminant meat production, resulting in about 
27 million net job gains due to the net-zero transition by 2050. Given the large extent of 
self-employment in the agricultural sector, it is likely that many of the job gains and losses 
would be experienced in reality as job shifts, for example, a farmer who over time transitions 
activities toward poultry or biomass crop production. However, the ease of these transitions 
would depend on factors including access to regional markets, shifts in required equipment, 
and local climatological limitations such as soil makeup and annual rainfall. Such potential 
shifts need to be seen in the broader farm-to-nonfarm transition that has been under way; 
global agricultural employment declined by about 115 million net jobs between 1991 and 
2020.239 This trend is likely to continue on a similar order of magnitude through ongoing 
productivity improvements and technological changes. Over the next 30 years, the net direct 
job gains specifically due to the transition of about 27 million would only somewhat offset 
larger expected job losses due to those productivity increases. The sector overall is expected 
to see reduced employment in line with historical trends.

Short-term risks and challenges. Smallholder farmers lacking access to capital may 
need financial support to make the transition to higher productivity and emissions-efficient 
methods. Any diet shifts could also influence demand for specific products, and farmers may 
find it challenging to shift their activities.

April 2020.

technologies. See technical appendix for further details.

25 percent higher if all upstream sectors are considered, without netting out the job changes from other modeled sectors.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringOpportunities. The shift toward emissions-efficient practices could stimulate demand for the 
supplies and equipment that enable on-farm decarbonization. Companies could develop and 
commercialize technologies—such as gene editing for disease resistance or for enhanced 
carbon sequestration—and vaccines and feed additives to inhibit enteric fermentation. 
The shift away from production of ruminant-animal protein and toward other proteins would 
likely lead to other business and economic opportunities.240 Rising use of bioenergy could lift 
demand for biomass from agriculture and forestry residues. 

Potential stakeholder responses. Given the breadth and scale of the agricultural sector, 
support for on-farm interventions would likely vary based on geography, farm type and 
structure, and farm output. Smallholder farmers lacking access to capital may need 
financial support to make the transition to higher productivity and emissions-efficient 
methods. Repurposing existing agricultural supports could cover a substantial amount 
of this cost. Research has found that 51 countries allocate approximately $570 billion in 
public support each year to agricultural producers that are responsible for two-thirds of 
global food production.241 Researchers have also identified other measures to support the 
cost of agricultural transitions beyond repurposing subsidies. These include public-private 
collaboration to create financial intermediation vehicles that pool capital and unlock financing, 
and promoting the adoption of greenhouse-gas-efficient farming practices by ensuring that 
farmers are paid premiums for their improved practices.242

Changes in agricultural jobs and activities would likely need support through improved 
access to information, technology, training, and well-designed safety nets to foster greater 
resilience among rural communities. Many of the measures being deployed in any case to 
support farmers—for example, agricultural extension services, reskilling to support the farm-
to-nonfarm transition, and training—can be adapted to the needs of a net-zero transition, 
including to help farmers adopt new agricultural practices.

On the demand side, changing long-standing food-consumption patterns—in parts of the 
world where it is feasible to do so without nutritional impacts—will likely require extensive 
efforts, including consumer education. More broadly, the net-zero transition could be 
supported by mechanisms that reward farmers and consumers for adopting lower-emissions 
practices, such as including agricultural emissions in emissions trading schemes, carbon 
pricing regimes, offset programs, and grant and subsidy programs.

McKinsey & CompanyForestry and other land use: Financing forest protection and 
restoration while supporting people’s livelihoods

Forests, including tropical rainforests, boreal forests, peatlands, permafrost forests, and 
coastal and freshwater forested wetlands, sequester and store significant amounts of 
carbon, making them vital to Earth’s climatic equilibrium. They also support biodiversity 
and provide numerous environmental, social, and economic benefits, including increasing 
resilience to climate change and providing livelihoods for rural communities.243 However, 
each year, about ten million hectares of land—an area roughly the size of South Korea—are 
deforested, mainly to clear land for commercial or subsistence agriculture.244 Forestry and 
other land use accounts for nearly 14 percent of annual global CO₂ emissions, 5 percent of 
methane emissions, and 5 percent of nitrous oxide emissions.245 However, these estimates 
may insufficiently account for the role of forestry (see Box 7, “Accounting for the role of 
forests in managing emissions”). Deforestation contributes to emissions in two ways: first, 
CO₂ is released into the atmosphere through slash-and-burn deforestation, decomposition 
of felled trees, soil disturbance, and forest degradation. Second, the forests’ future capacity 
for carbon sequestration is lost. Protecting and restoring forests would help counter climate 
change. Such an effort would require capital spending, along with actions to address the 
socioeconomic impacts on the millions of people who make their living in and around forests 
(Exhibit 23). 

Paths to decarbonization. Preventing deforestation has substantial abatement potential 
and is cheaper to implement than the solutions available in many other sectors. Reducing 
deforestation in tropical areas is especially economical, at a cost of less than $3 per metric 
ton of CO₂, including land-acquisition costs and operating costs.246 Avoiding deforestation 
also has lower maintenance costs than reforestation projects and thus tends to be cheaper 
for the same land cost.247 Although measuring the effects of deforestation is challenging 
and trees absorb CO₂ at widely varying rates (depending on their species, location, and the 
concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere), estimates suggest that over a 30-year period, 
a tree can store an additional 60 to 85 percent as much carbon as is released when the 
tree is cut down or burned, and that overall emissions could be even higher considering 
uncertainties around secondary emissions and forgone carbon sequestration resulting 
from deforestation.248 Halting deforestation prevents emissions immediately, whereas the 
benefits of nature restoration can take longer to realize: forests take an average of 25 to 
30 years to grow and, in some cases, up to a century to fully mature. Nonetheless, in addition 
to preventing deforestation, nature restoration via reforestation, afforestation, peatland 
restoration, and coastal restoration would aid decarbonization because growing trees 
and plants sequester and store carbon. McKinsey research has found that approximately 
250 million hectares could be sustainably reforested today, especially in the tropical forests 
of countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Indonesia, and in the temperate forests of China,

248 Research indicates that forgone carbon sequestration and forest degradation are highly underestimated in current 
evaluations of deforestation emissions. Estimates are associated with large uncertainties, including lack of data 
(especially on secondary effects) and variations in carbon sequestration due to tree species, location, and concentration 
of CO₂ in atmosphere. Overall secondary emissions and forgone carbon sequestration resulting from deforestation could 
be up to nine times higher than direct emissions alone; see Sean Maxwell et al., “Degradation and forgone removals 
increase the carbon impact of intact forest loss by 626%,” Science Advances, volume 5, issue 10, October 2019.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringMexico, and the United States.249 Well-managed reforestation is a source of negative 
emissions that can be used to offset hard-to-abate emissions in sectors such as cement 
and steel, and it can be done right now.250 Protection and restoration of wetlands (including 
peatlands, permafrost wetlands, and coastal and freshwater wetlands) hold similar carbon-
removal potential and, in some instances, are cheaper than reforestation.251 While offering 
substantial benefits, restoration projects must be managed so as not to damage biodiversity, 
deplete local water resources, or otherwise cause harm via actions such as planting native 
species alongside nonnative species and establishing monoculture plantations.252

Shifts in demand, capital spending, and jobs. Our analysis suggests that in the NGFS Net 
Zero 2050 scenario, deforestation would be reduced by more than half by 2025 to prevent 
emissions and preserve carbon sinks, and extensive reforestation would begin now. Forested 
land would increase by 160 million hectares between 2020 and 2030 and then stay relatively 
stable. This rapid forest protection and restoration program would help achieve carbon-
sequestration of more than 350 metric megatons of CO₂ per year by 2030.253

To achieve the outcomes modeled by the net-zero scenario would require annual average 
capital spending of $40 billion in avoided deforestation and land restoration. Almost 
all of this total capital would be deployed in the next decade, primarily to acquire land. 
Avoiding deforestation and land restoration would affect operating costs for labor, 
monitoring, compliance, as well as payments to countries or communities that preserve 
forests. This investment is critical given the role forests can play in enhancing natural 
CO₂ removals from the atmosphere. If this investment, or actual CO₂ removals per dollar 
invested, proves insufficient, it would place an even greater onus on the rest of the economy 
to eliminate carbon emissions in order to maintain an even chance of limiting warming to 
1.5 degrees Celsius.

Halting deforestation would have a significant impact on forest-border communities, where 
many residents are subsistence-level farmers whose livelihoods depend on clearing forests 
for agriculture.254 Up to 90 percent of deforestation is driven by such expansion of agricultural 
land.255 Since agriculture is a primary driver of deforestation activities, a key lever will involve 
improved agricultural practices, to aid food production without expanding agricultural 
land area.

253 The analysis in this deep dive is focused on a hypothetical path and is not meant to serve as a projection or prediction. 

This research does not take a position on the feasibility, likelihood, or nature of a 1.5°C path. Instead, we seek to 
demonstrate the shifts that would need to take place if the goal of 1.5 degrees is to be attainable, and a relatively orderly 
transition achieved. It is based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2), which limits global 
warming to 1.5°C “through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net-zero CO₂ emissions around 2050, giving 
at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5°C by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot.” 
While high-emissions activities fall rapidly and steeply during the scenario, they do not necessarily reach net zero in all 
sectors. Residual CO₂ emissions from these activities are counterbalanced by removals. In some cases, variables were 
downscaled by Vivid Economics to provide more sector granularity, which we often continue to refer to as being based on 
or consistent with the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. See the technical appendix for further details.

254 Notably, a transition away from agriculture can also play a role in shielding people from the risk of decreased ability to work 
that results from rising heat and humidity levels. See Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic 
impacts, McKinsey Global Institute, January 2020.

Accounting for the role of forests in managing emissions 

Accounting for carbon emissions in forestry and other land use can be challenging 
because there is great uncertainty over factors such as carbon-sequestration rates, 
natural emissions, and anthropogenic emissions. Conventional accounting for emissions 
typically fails to account for forgone carbon sequestration, forest degradation, indirect 
emissions that occur as a result of deforestation, indirect emissions such as those 
from forest fires caused by a changing climate, and emissions from land classified 
as unmanaged.1

Other methodological choices can also cause emissions from deforestation to be 
underestimated. For instance, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change and the FAO calculate deforestation rates on the basis of net changes in global 
tree cover—a method that may not fully account for emissions and removals. A large, 
old tree stores a lot of carbon, which is released when the tree is cut down and burned, 
whereas a smaller, younger tree planted to replace it stores much less carbon. Using 
tree cover as a proxy for emissions could thus overlook the carbon released by the loss 
of older trees. Nor does it account for differences in the carbon-sequestration capacity 
of various tree species. 

Methodological choices can also understate the importance of forestry and other 
land use relative to other systems. Forestry emissions are typically presented on a net 
basis: carbon emissions (deforestation) minus carbon removals (such as reforestation, 
sequestration, and afforestation). The resulting net emissions are much smaller than the 
gross emissions from this system; studies have shown that gross emissions in land use 
and land-use change are up to five times larger than net emissions. This gap between 
net and gross emissions is much smaller in other systems because carbon sequestration 
is not significant for other sectors.2

Beyond emissions, preserving forests has many other benefits, such as temperature 
regulation, rainfall regulation, water filtration, prevention of soil erosion, and crop 
pollination, that are not considered in most accounting methods. Evaluating these 
benefits is challenging because they are mainly nonmarket benefits, but they are 
thought to be large. For instance, an FAO study estimated that the 1.1 million hectares 
of forest in the Beijing municipality provided environmental services such as soil 
protection worth $5.3 billion.3 

1  Edge effects can lead to forest degradation. Edge effects come into play when two different habitats border 

each other—in this instance, forests and artificial habitats such as roads or cropland—and affect species within 
a certain range of that border. Deforestation creates many new edges in forests and produces predominantly 
negative edge effects, including increased sunlight, wind exposure, and higher temperatures. Existing fauna and 
flora may not be able to survive the altered conditions on newly created edge land. What’s more, the drier edge 
climate increases the risk of forest fires, which can affect non-edge sections.

McKinsey & CompanyOur analysis suggests that the transition described by the Net Zero 2050 scenario would 
see the addition of approximately one million direct afforestation jobs by 2050.256 Most would 
be jobs related to soil preparation, planting, and management.257 This number could be even 
higher, since more jobs could be required in the forest sector to prevent and contain wildfires, 
protect watersheds, prevent flooding and erosion, and restore areas affected by extreme 
weather. Finally, while not sized here, there is also an important role for jobs related to the 
management of forests: plantations can reduce pressure on unmanaged forests and can 
have positive impacts on climate-change mitigation depending on the end use of the wood 
harvested and the use of wood residues.258 Managing plantation forests for timber and carbon 
requires care and a well-trained workforce, and it can generate employment and revenue for 
local populations that can be used in turn to further expand the forest area.

Short-term risks and challenges. Incentives will need to be realigned in order to prevent 
deforestation. For example, landowners in forest-border zones earn revenues from clearing 
forest to increase crop or livestock production. There are few, if any, subsidies or means of 
compensation for preserving forestland. Financial returns on reforestation, afforestation, 
and avoiding deforestation can also be uncertain because they depend heavily on future 
carbon prices.

Opportunities. Forest protection and restoration projects could help generate revenue 
from the sale of carbon credits in carbon markets, including voluntary carbon markets. 
The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets has estimated that the market for 
carbon credits could be worth upward of $50 billion a year by 2030.259 Forests also provide 
biomass, which can be used as construction material in bioenergy production or as feedstock 
for bioplastics and other bio products. Biomass management will need to be implemented 
carefully to ensure a net-zero climate impact.260 Curbing activities that damage forests would 
need to go hand-in-hand with economic diversification, especially in communities where 
deforestation is integral to people’s livelihoods. This diversification, in turn, could create 
new opportunities in industries such as ecotourism: McKinsey research has identified an 
opportunity to create or safeguard 30 million jobs in ecotourism if nature conservation on land 
and in international waters doubled by 2030.261

Potential stakeholder responses. Current international efforts to prevent deforestation aim 
to financially reward countries for conserving their forests.262 Results from such programs 
have been mixed. The structure of incentives can influence whether forestry projects are 
supported and compliance is achieved. As discussed above, carbon markets could also 
play an important role in forest protection. Initiatives to provide nonagricultural economic 
opportunities in forest regions and to institute compensating mechanisms could reduce 
agriculture-driven deforestation.

256 Scope of forestry and other land use employment analysis limited to jobs related to new afforestation and new 

deforestation, not all current logging jobs.

257 Job losses and gains described in this analysis refer to those tied specifically to transition-related changes (for example, 

the shift from fossil fuel energy production to solar, wind, and other renewables). Losses and gains due to macroeconomic 
forces such as income, population, and productivity growth have also been excluded. A job is counted as a loss or a gain 
if it involves a shift in sector or subsector for a worker, indicating a changing job function, or a change in the geography 
of an existing job. O&M jobs consist of those related to the operations and maintenance activities in the sector and their 
supply chains, and include direct and indirect jobs. Indirect jobs are those created in the supply chain of the sector. In 
calculating indirect jobs, we exclude a set of sectors for which we have done bottom-up calculations elsewhere, including 
agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining and extraction of energy; coke and refined petroleum, other nonmetallic mineral 
products, manufacture of basic metals, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers; power; machinery, and equipment and 
construction. We do this to avoid double counting our job impacts. The indirect jobs shifts would be about 15 to 25 percent 
higher if all upstream sectors are considered, without netting out the job changes from other modeled sectors. See 
technical appendix for details.

Voluntary Carbon Markets, January 2021.

260 Biomass is already part of the carbon cycle, and it stores carbon until it is burned. Areas where biomass is sustainably 
harvested can be reforested to sequester additional carbon; however, it is important to remember that new trees take 
more than 30 years to sequester the carbon released from harvested trees. In the meantime, emissions are net positive.

4. The transition in 

countries and regions 

Viewed by geography, the challenges of the net-zero transition by 2050 are universal: all 
regions would need to decarbonize, all would have some exposure of their economies to the 
transition, all would face some degree of physical risk, and all would have growth potential 
resulting from the transition. But the exposure and its effects will be uneven. Our analysis 
suggests that regions with lower GDP per capita and those with greater fossil fuel resources 
would need to invest more than other regions, relative to GDP, to reduce emissions, build a 
low-emissions economy, and support economic development. They would also see a larger 
proportion of their economies exposed to the shifts under a net-zero transition. Lower-income 
households everywhere will be most affected, as discussed in chapter 2.

In this chapter, we consider four aspects of how the economic transformation could affect 
countries and regions. We look at the capital they would need to spend to decarbonize, the 
extent of their economic exposure, their exposure to rising physical climate risk, and the 
growth potential in their natural-capital endowments and their stores of technological and 
human capital. 

One of the key challenges of a net-zero transition is that it could potentially set back progress 
on economic development goals in developing regions, bolstering the case for global 
cooperation. In these regions, national economies are more dependent today on sectors that 
would be exposed to the transition and would therefore be more exposed to shifts in jobs, 
GDP, and capital stock. And some of them will face a double burden—being exposed to both 
the transition adjustments and rising physical risks. At the same time, the transition could 
create potential for economic growth in many geographies.

To provide further understanding of the economic and societal adjustments that countries 
may need to make, we group 69 countries into six archetypes, based on their exposure to 
the socioeconomic shifts that will characterize the transition. They are fossil fuel resource 
producers, emissions-intensive producers, agriculture-based economies, land-use-intensive 
countries, downstream-emissions manufacturers, and services-based economies.263 We also 
describe the varying growth potential that the transition could create for countries in these 
archetypes and, where noteworthy, the spending on physical assets they would need to 
make during the transition and the physical risks they could face if emissions continued to 
increase (see Box 8, “Methodology to assess countries’ current exposure to the transition and 
potential opportunities”).

To manage exposure, each country can consider taking actions of its own, such as investing 
in assets, funding worker-retraining programs, and supporting the growth of low-emissions 
sectors. But some countries are likely to face more substantial exposure, and making 
economic and societal adjustments may also be more challenging for them. Addressing 
economic and societal adjustments will thus only be possible with collective action and global 
solidarity at an unprecedented scale, as we discuss in chapter 5. The country and regional 
implications of the net-zero transition could also potentially affect trade flows, as we noted in 
Box E6 in the executive summary.

263 Countries were selected based on data availability across all the indicators in our analysis, as well as to ensure broad 

geographic coverage. Although we have placed each country within a single archetype, any given country—especially 
those with large and diversified economies—could also face some of the same issues we have highlighted for other 
archetypes. The archetypes thus indicate key issues a country may face but do not exclude the possibility that 
stakeholders in particular countries may need to reckon with issues that may be more closely associated with other 
archetypes.

143

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringBox 8

Methodology to assess countries’ current exposure to the transition 
and potential opportunities 

The analysis here examines the nature and magnitude of the exposure of countries to the 
transition as well as their potential to benefit from opportunities. 

We first examine the overall spending on physical assets for energy and land-use systems 
that will be needed in different regions; we do this using activity levels for different 
sectors and regions from the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario and unit capital costs for 
different technologies. 

Second, we examine the exposure of the economies of different countries to transition 
shifts more broadly by focusing on 69 countries that make about 95 percent of global 
GDP and about 80 percent of global emissions. Our approach to assessing countries’ 
exposure to the net-zero transition involves measuring how much of their economy relates 
to sectors that, in turn, have high exposure to the transition and assessing the scale of 
change consumers may need to undertake. 

To measure the exposure in each area of the economy, we considered the share of a 
country’s GDP, capital stock, and jobs in sectors most exposed to the transition. We chose 
these areas because they collectively represent production activity and stocks of human 
and physical capital. To identify the sectors most exposed to the net-zero transition, we 
calculated the full life cycle of emissions of the sector (scope 1, 2, and 3) divided by the 
sector’s output. Through this, we identified the most exposed sectors—namely, those 
with high emissions intensity in their own operations; those whose products, in turn, emit 
while being used; or those that have high emissions embedded in their supply chains 
(for further details, see also chapter 3). Each economy’s transition-exposure score is the 
average of the shares of GDP, capital stock, and jobs in these exposed sectors. Thus, a 
zero score would indicate that none of the country’s GDP, capital stock, or jobs are in these 
sectors, while 100 would indicate that all of the country’s GDP, capital stock, and jobs are 
in these sectors. 

Separately, we also look at consumer activity in the form of per capita household 
emissions (from driving, heating, and cooking) to assess the materiality of exposure 
for consumers and the extent to which they may need to shift practices as a result 
of the transition. For our consumer metric, we look at the amount of emissions 
consumers are directly responsible for by examining the consumer shares of road and 
buildings emissions. 

Third, in addition to spending on physical assets and assessment of economies’ exposure 
to the transition, we have evaluated each country’s current position with respect to the 
opportunities that could arise in a net-zero transition. We primarily assess endowments of 
natural capital and the availability of technological and human capital as the basis for the 
comparative advantages that countries possess or could build over time.

Other aspects of a country’s activities could be exposed, but we have not included those 
here. For example, we have not included tax revenue and exports, given the strong 
relationship of these two to GDP. As another example, countries with high exposure today 
may eventually benefit from the transition—for instance, by establishing economical 
sources of renewable power or building future assets in a way that reduces their future 
exposure. We instead describe these opportunities through our assessment of natural, 
technological, and human capital endowments, and consider this independent of our 
assessment of how countries’ economies are exposed today. This is because such 
opportunities would be captured over time. They are also independent of the extent of 
exposure of countries today, and the associated economic and societal adjustments they 
would need to undertake.

For a list of sources for this section and other details, see the technical appendix.

McKinsey & CompanyDeveloping countries and fossil 
fuel–producing regions have 
relatively large exposure to the 
transition, raising concerns 
about growth and inequality

In a net-zero transition, every country and region would need to spend on physical assets 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and secure low-emissions energy to power future 
economic growth. We find that the relative size of the required spending on physical assets 
would be different across countries and regions. 

In conducting this analysis, we sized the spending using trajectories provided by the NGFS for 
the Net Zero 2050 scenario. Some of these trajectories are provided at the regional level and 
others at the national level, influencing the granularity of our analysis.264 We consider spending 
needed across our key energy and land-use systems to replace and build low-carbon physical 
capital stock and enabling infrastructure.265

The world’s largest economies, the United States, Europe, and China, alongside other 
developed regions, account for more than half of total spending in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 
scenario. This represents about 6 percent of their combined national GDP in the period 
2021 to 2050 (Exhibit 24). These regions would invest more than half of their total net-zero 
spending to switch away from the use of fossil fuels in mobility, buildings, and industrial 
applications. They would also make substantial capital spending in power to increase low-
emissions electricity penetration, deploy storage technologies, and upgrade grids.   

While the absolute value of spending would be lower for developing regions, the amount 
is much larger when measured as a share of GDP. In sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, 
India, and some other Asian countries, spending on physical assets could amount to about 
10 percent of GDP or more. These regions already spend more as a share of GDP on physical 
assets for energy and land-use systems today compared with developed economies, and 
this is expected to continue—irrespective of future transition actions—given their stage of 
development and their goal to spur higher rates of economic growth and development.266 
For example, in our analysis of the NGFS Current Policies scenario, investment in India would 
still total more than 9 percent of GDP. Spending would increase to some extent from these 
levels in the net-zero scenario analyzed here. It would moreover be spent differently. Sixty 
percent of annual average investments would be on low-emissions assets under current 
policies compared to 80 percent in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. Similarly in sub-
Saharan Africa, spending on low-emissions assets would increase from about 50 percent 
under Current Policies to 70 percent in a net-zero transition. In the future, as incomes increase 
and the build-out of low-carbon assets peaks, developing regions would invest a declining 
fraction of their income in energy and land systems, relative to today. 

264 All analyses here are based on the 2021 NGFS scenarios. The Net Zero scenario is based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 
scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE. In the scenario net zero is reached by 2050 on a global basis but there are some 
regional differences. China, India, the Middle East and North Africa, Russia, Ukraine, and Commonwealth of Independent 
States, and other Asia are assumed to still have some positive emissions that are offset by net negative emissions in the 
rest of the world. For further details, see the technical appendix and “Technical documentation version 2.2,” NGFS Climate 
Scenario Database.

265 This analysis is focused on the spending needed to build physical assets. We do not consider spending needed, for 

example, to reskill workers, for the economic diversification of affected communities, or for the write-offs associated with 
stranded assets. The estimation here includes spend for physical assets across various forms of energy supply, energy 
demand, and land use. This includes both what is typically considered investment in national accounts and, in some cases, 
spending on consumer durables such as personal cars. We typically consider spending to replace physical assets at the 
point of emissions (for example, cars for mobility); additional spending would also occur through the value chain. We have 
not sized this, to minimize double counting. For a detailed view of the spending on physical assets sized in this research, 
see chapter 2 and the technical appendix.

266 In the NGFS scenario examined here, sub-Saharan Africa and India are expected to see real GDP growth of about 4 to 
5 percent per year on average over the next 30 years, compared with 3 percent growth for China and 1 to 2 percent 
growth for developed regions.

for vehicles), and land use. This includes both what are typically considered “investments” in national accounts and spend, in some cases, on consumer durables such 
as personal cars. Scenario based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2). Based on analysis of systems that account for ~85% of 
overall carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) emissions today. Our analysis includes a more comprehensive view of spending by households and businesses on assets that 
use energy, capital expenditures in agriculture and forestry, and some continued spend in high-emissions physical assets like fossil fuel–based vehicles and power 
assets. For further details, see technical appendix. 

2. Our analysis divides high-emissions assets from low-emissions assets. High-emissions assets include assets for fossil fuel extraction and refining, as well as fossil fuel 
power production assets without CCS; fossil fuel heat production, gray-hydrogen production; steel BOF; cement fossil fuel kilns; ICE vehicles; fossil fuel heating and 
cooking equipment; dairy, monogastric, and ruminant meat production. Low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure include assets for blue-hydrogen production 
with CCS; green-hydrogen production using electricity and biomass; biofuel production; generation of wind, solar, hydro-, geothermal, biomass, gas with CCS, and 
nuclear power along with transmission and distribution and storage infrastructure; heat production from low-emissions sources such as biomass; steel furnaces using 
EAF, DRI with hydrogen, basic oxygen furnaces with CCS; cement kilns with biomass or fossil fuel kilns with CCS; low-emissions vehicles and supporting infrastructure; 
heating equipment for buildings run on electricity or biomass, including heat pumps; district heating connections; cooking technology not based on fossil fuels; building 
insulation; GHG-efficient farming practices; food crops, poultry and egg production; and land restoration. See technical appendix.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringThis is most evident in China, where spending on these systems accounts for about 
8.1 percent of GDP today, a proportion that would fall to 3 percent by 2050 in the NGFS 
Net Zero 2050 scenario.   

The nature of spending would vary substantially in developed and developing countries. 
First, the transition in the scenario examined here could take place at a slower pace in 
developing countries. As a consequence, spending on high-emissions assets would 
persist for longer and hence make up more than one-quarter of annual average spending. 
Second, the sectoral mix of their spending would look quite different. A much larger 
share of the spending on physical assets would go to power and agriculture in developing 
countries than in developed regions. In India, for example, 30 to 40 percent of spending would 
be in power. Similar levels of spending would be observed in other countries in developing 
Asia and Africa. Agriculture is the other area where the share of spending would be much 
higher than in developed regions. In Latin America, for example, it would increase by more 
than 50 percent over the course of the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, particularly for low-
carbon crops, emissions mitigation measures, and reforestation.

Fossil fuel–based economies would continue to have the highest spending on physical assets 
for energy and land-use systems as a share of their GDP, about 15 percent or higher in the 
Middle East and North Africa, Russia, Ukraine, and Commonwealth of Independent States 
such as Kazakhstan. These regions would continue to spend the largest share on fossil fuel 
production and distribution in the world in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario given their 
competitive cost position. The Middle East and North Africa in particular would account for 
more than 50 percent of the total spending on fossil fuels in 2050 in this scenario, up from 
30 percent today, even as demand declines by as much as 65 percent. However, even these 
economies would allocate about half of their spending to low-emissions assets or more under 
a net-zero transition. 

Importantly, while the relative scale of the spending on physical assets is substantially higher 
for developing and fossil fuel–based economies, this alone is not an indicator of how difficult 
it will be for developing and fossil fuel–reliant regions to reach a low-emissions economy. 
Indeed, as mentioned previously, many of these geographies already spend more as a share 
of GDP on physical assets for energy and land-use systems and are expected to continue 
to do so as they grow their economies. However, specific aspects of their net-zero transition 
could make deploying capital challenging for these regions. 

First, developing regions might face challenges in accessing capital markets. This may be 
particularly acute as they look to invest in low-emissions technologies, which may be harder 
to finance and come with different risk-return expectations. Second, as mentioned above, 
existing high-emissions assets in these economies are still relatively young; thus there may 
be less incentive to undertake low-carbon capital spending amid concerns about stranded 
assets. Third, there may not always be sufficient know-how and capacity on the ground to 
implement projects. Fourth, concerns of other socioeconomic consequences from a net-zero 
transition, for example, job dislocations, could exist. Finally, because the economies of these 
countries rely on emissions-intensive sectors, government tax revenues and public spending 
may be more constrained under a net-zero transition.267 

267 Similar conclusions were also reached by the IEA. See for example Financing clean energy transitions in emerging and 

developing economies, International Energy Agency, June 2021.

148

McKinsey & CompanyLarger shares of the economies of lower-income and fossil fuel 
resource-producing countries are exposed to the transition today

Beyond the spending on physical assets that regions would need to undertake, we also 
assessed how countries’ economies would be exposed to the net-zero transition, and thus 
need to transform. A country’s exposure to the transition increases with the share of its 
economy that comes from sectors that would experience outsize effects under a net-zero 
transition. Our analysis of economic systems and sectors, discussed in chapter 3, showed 
that sectors with the highest exposure would be those with emissions-intensive operations 
(for example, steelmaking), products (for example, automobile manufacturing), and supply 
chains (for example, construction). To gauge the transition exposure of national economies, 
we looked at the proportions of employment (jobs), economic production (GDP), and existing 
physical capital stock in these exposed sectors. We chose these variables to capture a broad 
range of economic exposures a country may experience. With these economic measures, we 
calculated a transition-exposure score ranging from zero for a country whose employment, 
economic production, and capital stock have no exposure to 100 for a country with 
full exposure.268

Four general points about this analytical method are worth emphasizing. First, it accounts for 
the possibility that countries that directly emit the most carbon may not necessarily have the 
highest levels of exposure. Exposure to the transition could result from either direct scope 1 
emissions (such as those resulting from domestic energy use) or from indirect emissions 
upstream and downstream in value chains. For example, a country with a large but relatively 
low-emissions automotive value chain could nevertheless be exposed to the transition. 

Second, country exposure varies with the share of jobs, output, or capital stock in sectors 
exposed to the transition rather than the absolute level. Assessing the exposed share of jobs 
or capital or output, rather than the absolute quantity of the exposed jobs or capital or output, 
provides a way of gauging the materiality of the transition for each country. 

Third, for this country-level analysis, we chose to measure economic exposure (share 
exposed) rather than quantify actual socioeconomic outcomes (realized gain or loss, for 
example in jobs, GDP, or value of physical capital stock) because such outcomes are not 
predetermined. They could be mitigated by the scale and nature of actions taken to manage 
the transition. Measuring the exposure therefore allows decision makers to understand 
where to focus attention and effort on managing the transition.

Finally, it is important to note that countries’ current efforts (for example, spending 
to transform power assets or to diversify economies) could reduce their exposure going 
forward. However, this analysis focuses on exposure today in order to create a fact base 
for countries to inform their decision making.

Based on our analysis, we can make the following observations:

 —  All countries’ economies would be exposed to the net-zero transition to some 

extent. On our transition-exposure scorecard, no country scores a zero, emphasizing the 
universality of the shifts required to achieve net zero by 2050. Some portion of jobs, GDP, 
or capital stock in every country is tied to sectors that are most exposed to the transition’s 
impacts: those that emit greenhouse gases directly, produce goods that emit GHGs, or 
use emissions-intensive inputs. These sectors make up about 40 percent of a country’s 
jobs on average, about 35 percent of a country’s GDP on average, and about 40 percent 
of a country’s capital stock on average (and in countries including India and Saudi Arabia, 
these percentages can rise to 50 to 70 percent).

268 Our transition exposure of economies score consists of average exposure in three categories: employment (jobs), 

production activity (GDP), and capital stock. In each case, we consider the share of overall activity or stock that is in 
sectors most exposed to the transition—that is, those with high emissions in their operations, in the use of their products, 
or in their supply chains. These sectors include mining and extraction of energy-producing products, manufacture of 
coke and refined petroleum products, manufacture of motor vehicles, manufacture of other transportation equipment, 
manufacture of machinery and equipment, manufacture of fabricated metal products, manufacture of electrical 
equipment, fossil fuel–based electricity, manufacture of basic metals, manufacture of other nonmetallic minerals, 
manufacture of chemicals, air transportation, water transportation, land transportation, agriculture and forestry, 
sewerage, food products, water supply, wood products, paper products, textiles, pharmaceutical products, construction, 
rubber and plastic products, and mining of nonenergy products and mining support. For further details, see the technical 
appendix.

149

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring —  Countries with lower GDP per capita generally have higher exposure to the transition 
today. This is because relatively higher shares of their jobs, GDP, and capital stock are in 
more exposed sectors, such as emissions-intensive manufacturing, agriculture, and fossil 
fuel–based power, while a smaller share of their economies is in service sectors, which 
are relatively less exposed to the transition (Exhibit 25). Examples of the most exposed 
countries include Bangladesh, India, Kenya, and Nigeria. By contrast, our analysis shows 
that countries with higher GDP per capita would be less exposed because much of their 
economy is in service sectors, which have relatively lower exposure to the transition. 
France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States are examples of such countries.

 —  Significant fossil fuel resource production creates relatively high exposure for some 
countries. Examples include countries in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, 
as well as Australia, Canada, Nigeria, Norway, and Russia, which have significant deposits 
of oil, gas, or coal. About one-third of Qatar’s GDP and capital stock is in the extraction 
and refinement of fossil fuels. In Norway, the fossil fuel sector represents about one-fifth 
of GDP and approximately 15 percent of capital stock. As a result, significant portions of 
these economies would be exposed to the transition, and could experience some degree 
of transformation in a net-zero economy.

 —  Several countries that would have high exposure to the transition also face elevated 
physical risks from rising heat and humidity. Drawing on our previous research on 
physical climate risks, we find that countries like Ghana, India, Nigeria, and Vietnam, which 
would be more exposed to the transition, also have high exposure to the physical risks 
associated with a hotter and more humid climate. These countries are exposed to physical 
risks specifically to human livability and workability from lethal heat waves or chronic 
increases in heat and humidity.269 Our prior analysis of India, for example, showed that 
some 160 million to 200 million people could be living in urban areas with a nonzero annual 
probability of experiencing a lethal heat wave by as early as 2030, under a scenario in 
which no adaptation or mitigation measures are implemented.270 

Thus, for many lower-income and fossil fuel–producing countries, challenges associated 
with climate change could compound. These countries would need to balance multiple 
imperatives: decarbonizing their economies and funding associated capital expenditures, 
managing exposure of large parts of their economies to a net-zero transition and to rising 
physical risks, and enabling economic development and growth, particularly by expanding 
access to affordable, secure energy. Secondary effects from direct exposure could also 
extend to government tax revenues and exports, which are often linked with exposed sectors 
like fossil fuel extraction or steel. Inequity concerns may grow as an issue, particularly as 
developing economies argue that they have contributed less than others to emissions and 
yet are being asked to shoulder a large burden in the net-zero transition that could slow their 
efforts to make energy more accessible and affordable to lower-income households.

As discussed in chapter 2, low-income households everywhere would also be most exposed 
to any cost increases that feed through to consumers. This is particularly true for energy 
prices, and any up-front capital costs that households may need to bear (for example, related 
to autos). At the same time, while the net-zero transition will mean countries are exposed 
differentially, they also have opportunities to benefit from the economic adjustment.

GDP per capita, $ thousand90303160402015The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringCountries could use natural 
endowments or technological and 
human capital to achieve the potential 
growth the transition would enable 

Just as countries are exposed to the transition’s shifts, they also have the potential to gain 
from opportunities that arise from a net-zero transition. A country could prosper during and 
after the transition for many reasons. Here, we focus on their endowments of natural capital 
(such as sunshine and wind) and the availability of technological and human capital, that could 
help them capture opportunities from the transition. Whereas natural-capital endowments 
are fixed, other forms of capital can be developed. While the following list of factors is not 
exhaustive, it is meant to provide an initial overview of considerations for decision makers:

Natural-capital endowments. Growth potential could be available to countries with rich 
stocks of natural capital, such as ample sunlight and wind, forestland, mineral resources, 
and CO₂ storage potential. Natural geological features that enable less energy-intensive 
extraction of fossil fuels could also be a useful endowment. Our analysis of countries’ natural-
capital endowments includes the following types (Exhibits 26a–d):

 —  Solar potential. High solar irradiance (that is, power received from the sun per unit 

area) provides an opportunity to generate renewable solar power.271 It also provides 
other opportunities—for example, the potential to produce green hydrogen for 
domestic consumption and for export, as huge amounts of low-emissions energy 
are needed for green hydrogen. Example countries with high availability of solar 
resources include Australia, Egypt, Kenya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and 
the United Arab Emirates. Many countries with high solar potential rely substantially 
on fossil fuel assets today.

 —  Wind potential. High wind power density allows countries to generate renewable wind 
power and, as above, avail of other opportunities such as green hydrogen.272 Argentina, 
Chile, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom have the highest wind power 
potential of the countries we analyzed. 

 —  Reforestation potential. The potential for reforestation of land also creates opportunities 

for CO₂ sequestration.273 This, in turn, could help countries produce carbon credits 
that might be sold on voluntary or compliance markets.274 We measured countries’ 
potential by assessing the extent of land that is technically suitable for reforestation. 
We narrowed this area down to a realistic reforestation potential using biophysical filters. 

271 Global photovoltaic power potential by country, World Bank, April 2020. Average theoretical solar potential, global 

horizontal irradiance, kWh/m2 per day. It is important to note that solar endowments alone do not determine the ability of 
the grid to transition because of issues of grid storage and managing daily and seasonal intermittency.

273 McKinsey Nature Analytics. Countries’ reforestation potential was calculated by assessing the extent of land that is 

technically suitable for reforestation, then narrowing this area down to a realistic reforestation potential using biophysical 
filters. The resulting area is then converted into carbon sequestration potential. Three specific filters were used. First, 
a biome filter, to exclude biomes where reforestation is nonnatural or could have negative effects on ecosystems 
and climate, for instance boreal forests/taiga; grasslands, tropical savannas, and shrublands; and deserts and xeric 
shrublands biomes. Second, a water stress filter, to exclude areas where water stress is projected to be extremely high 
(greater than 80 percent) or the area is forecast to be arid in 2040, based on the RCP 8.5 scenario. Third, a human 
footprint filter to exclude current cropland and urban areas, as well as areas where urban expansion is projected with a 
probability greater than 50 percent by 2050. Spatially explicit carbon-sequestration rates were then applied to each area 
with reforestation potential to estimate the total abatement potential. See Jean-Francois Bastin et al., “The global tree 
restoration potential,” Science, volume 365, number 6448, July 2019; and Susan Cook-Patton et al., “Mapping carbon 
accumulation potential from global natural forest regrowth,” Nature, issue 585, September 2020.

McKinsey & CompanyWe then converted the resulting area into carbon sequestration potential. Based on this 
measure, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Panama have the highest reforestation potential 
relative to land area of the countries we analyzed, and Brazil has the highest potential in 
absolute terms.

 — Minerals’ availability. Minerals needed to make low-carbon goods such as solar panels and 
electric-vehicle batteries include cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, zinc, and rare earths.275 
These can be used domestically or exported. Of the countries analyzed, Brazil, Chile, 
China, and Vietnam have the highest average reserves of these minerals relative to their 
respective current annual production.

275 Mineral commodity summaries 2020, US Geological Survey, January 2020. Ratio of proven reserves to global production 

for each mineral is calculated as the total proven reserves of the mineral divided by the total current annual global 
production. This was done in order to account for the varying values of the absolute levels of different minerals (that is, one 
ton of copper is not the same as one ton of cobalt). We therefore normalize the reserves available of each mineral with their 
respective current annual production (acknowledging that usage may increase during and after the net-zero transition, 
as well as the fact that reserves include only currently discovered deposits). This is not an exhaustive list of all materials 
critical for the net-zero transition, and is meant to be illustrative.

 —  Carbon-sequestration capacity. Capture and storage of CO₂ may enable a country’s 
carbon-intensive industries to continue operating while avoiding the associated 
emissions. It may also facilitate the creation of a blue-hydrogen industry (where 
emissions from hydrogen production via natural gas are economically captured and 
stored). Countries such as Canada, Norway, and the United States have extensive 
potential to store captured carbon geologically, based on the measure analyzed here. 
They have identified many high-potential basins and are beginning to develop pilot CO₂ 
storage projects.276

Other forms of natural capital that we did not assess for data availability reasons could also 
prove useful. For example, the carbon intensity of a country’s fossil fuel extraction could 
affect its competitiveness if a price is placed on carbon. Heavy oils (such as those in the 
Canadian oil sands) require large energy inputs (for instance, steam flooding) or the use of 
light hydrocarbon diluents for transportation, so they have much higher carbon intensities 
than light crude oils.277 Saudi Arabia’s crude oil production, by comparison, has some of the 
lowest carbon intensity regionally and globally.

Technological and human capital: Some countries have already gained strong positions 
in the markets for sophisticated low-carbon goods, such as solar panels and EVs. 
These markets could have further growth potential under a net-zero transition, and the 
opportunities would thus continue and potentially increase. Countries could more easily serve 
these markets if they possess suitable technological and human capital. Countries that now 
lack these forms of capital could develop them by creating favorable conditions for investors, 
supporting R&D and industrial development, upskilling or reskilling workers, or training 
students to work in low-carbon industries, among other initiatives. 

We evaluate a country’s technological capital based on R&D spending as a percentage of 
GDP and on the number of patents related to climate-change mitigation.278 These metrics 
help measure the extent of a country’s innovative capacity in relation to climate transition. 
For example, the United States spends 2.8 percent of its GDP on R&D and has approximately 
11,000 patents in technologies such as renewable-energy generation and low-emissions 
transportation that would likely be needed in a net-zero transition. Similarly, South Korea 
spends 4.8 percent of its GDP on R&D and has approximately 6,600 patents in similar areas. 

We measure the potential for a country to benefit from human capital needs in a net-zero 
transition based on the share of STEM graduates in the population.279 This provides an 
indication of the workforce’s technical skill, which, in turn, might be applied to developing 
solutions for the climate transition. The highest-scoring countries in this respect include 
China, Finland, Israel, Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, and Singapore (for further details, see also 
discussion in the next section).

279 We used data from the International Labour Organization ILOSTAT database. While we focused on STEM skills for our 

analysis in this report, we acknowledge that many other skills will also be needed in a net-zero transition.

McKinsey & CompanyVarious forms of physical capital could also support a country’s transition to a low-carbon 
economy, although we have not measured them in quantitative terms for this analysis, due 
to data availability. Existing industrial processes and infrastructure that have low emissions 
intensity could prove advantageous, for example, if consumers shift their preferences or 
carbon border taxes are applied. Even currently high-emissions infrastructure could be a 
benefit if it can readily be retrofitted, for example, with alternate low-emissions fuel sources. 

Six archetypes of countries based 
on their transition exposure 
highlight the unevenness of 
the economic shifts needed 

To help decision makers understand how the net-zero transition might play out across 
countries, we grouped 69 countries into six distinct archetypes based on the nature and 
magnitude of their exposure to the economic transformation we analyze in this report 
(Exhibit 27). This exercise highlights the distinct and uneven economic and societal 
adjustments that countries will need to make as the world transitions to net-zero emissions. 

Sector exposures reflect the average shares of GDP, jobs, and existing physical capital stock 
in groups of sectors that are most exposed to the transition.280 In addition, we assessed 
per capita household scope 1 emissions to measure exposure at the household level. 
This measure provides an indication of the extent to which households may need to change 
their behaviors (for example, adopting new diets) and invest (for example, in EVs) as the 
transition progresses.281 We also describe how countries in each archetype could benefit from 
transition opportunities.

Countries in the same archetype have exposure in similar parts of the economy, although 
their overall exposure scores can vary. Although we have placed each country within a single 
archetype, any given country—especially those with large and diversified economies—
could also face some of the same issues we have highlighted for other archetypes. The 
archetypes thus indicate key issues a country may face but do not exclude the possibility that 
stakeholders in particular countries may need to reckon with issues that may be more closely 
associated with other archetypes.

280 These groups of exposed sectors are described in more detail in chapter 3. They include sectors such as fossil-fuel 

extraction and automotive manufacturing whose products are exposed to the transition (producers of fossil fuel energy 
and producers of fossil fuel–dependent products), sectors with high levels of emissions from their operations (emitters in 
core operations), and sectors that make products with high levels of embedded emissions because of the nature of their 
inputs (users of inputs from emitters).

281 We include per capita household scope 1 emissions in our analysis of country exposure here but do not include it in the 

earlier scoring of overall transition exposure across countries. This is to allow us to focus our analysis there on production 
activities and to limit any potential overlap with consumption activities. We also omit spending on physical assets from 
the archetype analysis here because of data limitations. Because NGFS scenarios provide some decarbonization 
trajectories at a regional rather than country level, we were unable to estimate the individual spending requirements of 
the 69 countries covered by our analysis. Unless otherwise cited, the emissions data cited in this chapter come from the 
European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR).

We also examine the potential of each country to seize transition opportunities by assessing 
their endowments of natural capital and their stocks of technological and human capital. 
Exhibit 28 highlights a range of endowments for countries in different archetypes. It is also 
important to note that our discussion of country opportunities and transition exposure is 
illustrative and not exhaustive; for example, there may be other opportunities from which 
countries have the potential to benefit.

Finally, we also measure countries’ exposure to physical risk based on six indicators described 
in our previous physical risk research (Exhibit 29).282 Below, we describe the six archetypes 
and the attributes that define them. 

Fossil fuel resource producers 

Countries in this archetype include Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Egypt, Kuwait, Nigeria, 
Norway, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.
These economies have large fossil fuel resource–producing sectors, which include oil, gas, 
and coal extraction, along with the manufacturing of coke and refined petroleum products. 
As described in chapters 2 and 3, our analysis suggests that these sectors have high 
exposure to the transition because demand for their existing products could decline in a net-
zero transition, potentially also stranding physical assets. 

The magnitude of exposure varies among countries. For example, about 25 percent of 
Saudi Arabia’s GDP is in fossil fuel–producing sectors, and about one-third of Qatar’s GDP 
and capital stock is in those sectors. That compares with about 6 percent of GDP in Canada 
and 3 percent in Australia. A key adjustment for fossil fuel resource producers to consider 
under a net-zero transition would be diversifying their economies. Exposed sectors in these 
countries are often not the most significant employers; in most cases, these sectors account 
for less than 2 percent of jobs. However, the potential effect on national income could be 
significant. According to the International Energy Agency, annual per capita income from 
oil and natural gas in producer economies could fall by about 75 percent by the 2030s, with 
knock-on societal impacts.283

Replacing the economic output from exposed sectors could involve action to support 
growth in new industries needed for a net-zero economy, as we discuss below. Since fossil 
fuel resource sectors are also capital intensive, a relatively large share of capital stock in 
these countries (an average of about 17 percent versus about 3 percent in the rest of the 
countries) is also in sectors exposed to the net-zero transition. Some of this capital stock 
could be preserved if it is retrofitted to reduce emissions in the near term. One avenue would 
be spending to decarbonize the hydrocarbon value chain, for example, via CCS. Other assets 
may need to be retired prematurely (see chapter 2). Spending on physical assets is already 
high in these countries, for example about 15 percent in the Middle East and North Africa, and 
would continue at around these levels in a net-zero transition. However the allocation of this 
spending would be different: 45 percent would be spent on low-emissions assets, up from 
only around 10 percent today. Additional spending may also be needed to protect assets and 
people from rising physical climate risks. The level of physical risk varies among countries in 
this archetype, though our analysis suggests that countries toward the equator are likely to 
become hotter and more humid with increasing physical climate change.284 Other countries, 
such as Canada, may be less exposed and even see some benefit from a changing climate, for 
example, the potential for improved agricultural yields. 

Thus, for the countries with higher shares of exposure in particular, various challenges could 
exist: the potential loss of government revenue from exposed sectors, the reallocation 
of capital spending, and the potential need to diversify their economies while managing 
physical risks.

McKinsey & CompanyAt the same time, these countries have opportunities to tap into under a net-zero transition, 
though capturing them and sufficiently compensating for loss in revenues and exports will 
come with challenges. Many of these countries possess ample solar and wind resources, 
which are a prerequisite for developing renewable-energy capacity. Most countries rank in 
the top quartile of economies we examined for either solar or wind potential. For example, 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have high solar potential, while Canada, 
Norway, and Russia have high wind potential. These countries could use their renewables 
capacity to develop new projects, such as the production of green hydrogen. Saudi Arabia, 
for example, has started moving in this direction, unveiling plans for one of the world’s largest 
green-hydrogen projects in 2020.285 Relatively low levels of carbon intensity and relatively 
lower costs are associated with the oil and gas extraction of some fossil fuel producers, for 
example those in the Middle East; thus, those countries could be the last standing providers 
of the remaining fossil fuels needed in a net-zero economy, in the scenario modeled here.

Emissions-intensive producers

Countries in this archetype include Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, 
South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam. These economies center on 
producing industrial goods and agricultural commodities for domestic and world markets. 
They have high transition-exposure scores because their employment, GDP, and physical 
capital stock are concentrated in emissions-intensive manufacturing sectors like steel 
and cement, in fossil fuel–based power, and in agriculture.286 On average, exposed sectors 
account for almost half of jobs, GDP, and capital stock across these economies.

Our analysis suggests that a key challenge for these countries under a net-zero transition is 
asset stranding. Their capital stock (coal-fired power plants, for example) is often newer than 
that of advanced economies. In the Net Zero 2050 scenario, owners of industrial assets would 
likely face a difficult choice between retrofitting assets and retiring them (see chapter 2). 
The average age of coal power plants in India and China is less than 15 years, compared 
with more than 30 years in the United States.287 Lower-income countries may also find that 
some low-carbon technologies (for example, electric-arc furnaces for steel production and 
CCS equipment for steel or cement factories) remain too expensive to deploy or, in some 
cases, may not yet be ready for large-scale deployment. This puts these countries in a bind: 
the costs of low-emissions assets would likely need to come down before these emerging 
economies will invest in them rather than in high-emissions assets. Without careful planning, 
however, they run the risk that continued spending on lower-cost, high-emissions assets 
could result in the need to prematurely retire or reduce utilization of these assets after only a 
few years as the world transitions to a net-zero path.

Another area of exposure for these countries comes from the large share of their economic 
activity in hard-to-abate sectors like steel and cement; the costs of lower-carbon 
manufacturing processes (such as DRI-EAF steel) may be higher than those of existing 
processes, which may affect the profitability of these sectors. More broadly, while economic 
growth in these countries is expected to come with more construction activity, this could be 
more expensive in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario because of the rising costs of steel and 
cement. Higher construction costs could also affect consumers. 

285 John Parnell, “World’s largest green hydrogen project unveiled in Saudi Arabia,” Green Tech Media, July 7, 2020.
286 These are industrial sectors that have a high level of emissions intensity in their own operations (high scope 1 emissions 

intensity), for example, steel and cement manufacturing. For further details, see the sector-exposure analysis in chapter 3.

producers, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey; for agriculture-based economies, Morocco and the Philippines; for land-use-intensive countries, 
Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Malaysia, Panama, and Uruguay; for downstream-emissions manufacturers, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Sweden; and for services-based economies, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Israel, Netherlands, Portugal, 
Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland.

2. Power output achievable by a typical utility-scale PV system, taking into account global horizontal irradiation (or the total solar radiation that reaches a horizontal 

surface), the air temperature affecting the system performance, the system configuration, shading and soiling, and topographic and land-use constraints.

3. Mean wind power density of 10% windiest areas at a height of 100m. Calculated by downscaling large-scale forecasting data from the European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasts. These data are then entered into the DTU Wind Energy modeling system to model local wind climates for a 250m grid across the globe 
measured as watt per square meter.

4. Abatement potential is calculated using biophysical filters to identify reforestation opportunities on all land areas suitable for reforestation. Specific carbon-

sequestration rates that correspond to different opportunities are then applied to estimate the total abatement potential measured as tonnes of CO₂ per kilometer 
squared per year.

5. Average of the ratios of proven reserves in a country to global production across 6 minerals. Includes cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, zinc, and rare earths.
6. CCS (carbon capture and storage) Storage Indicator, a metric based on three factors: natural geological storage potential, maturity and confidence of storage resource 

assessments, and experience in CO2 storage project development to date.
7. Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget.
8. Number of patents filed in a country for technologies related to climate-change mitigation.
9. Tertiary-level graduates in a country that graduates in natural sciences, mathematics, and statistics, as a share of all graduates.
Note: Colors in each column based on relative quartiles within each column rather than across columns. Countries are allocated to an archetype to illustrate specific types 

of capital that they possess. However, any given country could also have access to some of the forms of capital highlighted for other archetypes.

1. RCP 8.5 = Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Our research on physical climate risk uses the RCP 8.5 scenario of greenhouse gas concentration because the 
higher-emissions scenario it portrays enables us to assess the inherent physical risk from climate change in the absence of adaptation and decarbonization actions. 
For fossil fuel resource producers, other countries include Australia, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Norway, Oman, UAE, and Venezuela; for emissions-intensive producers, 
Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey; for agriculture-based economies, Morocco and the Philippines; for land-use-intensive countries, Bolivia, 
Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Malaysia, Panama, and Uruguay; for downstream-emissions manufacturers, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, 
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Sweden; and for services-based economies, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Israel, Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, and 
Switzerland. For details on physical risk archetypes, see Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts, McKinsey Global Institute, 
January 2020.

2. We define a lethal heat wave as a 3-day period with maximum daily wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 34°C. This threshold was chosen because the commonly defined 
heat threshold for human survivability is 35°C wet-bulb, and large cities with significant urban heat island effects could push 34°C wet-bulb heat waves over the 35°C 
threshold. These projections are subject to uncertainty related to the future behavior of atmospheric aerosols and urban heat island or cooling island effects. 

3. Water stress is measured as annual demand for water as a share of annual supply of water. For this analysis, we assume that the demand for water stays constant over 
time, to allow us to measure the impact of climate change alone. Water stress projections for arid, low-precipitation regions were excluded due to concerns about 
projection robustness.

4. Risk values are calculated based on expected values, ie, probability-weighted value at risk.

Workers face exposure, too. Agriculture workers make up a large share of the workforce in 
these countries. They would be affected in the net-zero scenario as agriculture practices 
shift toward low-emissions farming and production shifts from livestock and feed to other 
goods. These changes would be particularly challenging for small subsistence farmers who 
are likely to lack access to the information, technical know-how, working capital (such as 
short-term loans), and investment capital (long-term loans) that could help them during the 
transition. Finally, many countries in this archetype could be substantially affected by rising 
physical risks. India, for example, could become hotter, more humid, and more flood-prone in 
a scenario where emissions are not abated.

Countries in this archetype could also benefit from the growth potential of a net-zero 
transition, according to our analysis. Overall, many are expected to experience faster 
economic growth than more developed economies and would invest in capital stock, such 
as power capacity. For example, as discussed above, spending to decarbonize and support 
growth in India could be as high as 11 percent of GDP over the next three decades. While the 
scale of spending is high, choosing to install low-emissions assets, such as renewables-based 
power, could help minimize stranded-asset risk and offer opportunities to leapfrog to new 
technologies that can come with lower operating costs. More broadly, such spending would 
also create near-term job opportunities, for example associated with the construction sector. 

Innovation opportunities could be available to some emissions-intensive producers; for 
example, some 39 percent of graduates in China are STEM specialists. Asian countries—many 
of which are included in this archetype—more broadly possess technological resources 
that could be conducive to low-emissions innovation. The region accounts for almost half 
of global R&D spending and over the last decade has produced the largest share of global 
growth in technology metrics such as patents filed, tech company revenue, and venture 
capital funding.288 

Many of these countries possess rich mineral deposits. For example, countries like China and 
Vietnam have reserves more than ten times larger than current annual global production of 
certain rare-earth metals that will be important for manufacturing low-emission technologies.
Some countries in this group have high reforestation- and afforestation-abatement potential, 
which gives them a chance to attract the capital spending necessary, through carbon-offset 
markets, to produce negative emissions. Indonesia, for example, could abate 34 tCO₂ per 
square kilometer of land. 

Agriculture-based economies

For the countries in this group, including Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, the Philippines, Senegal, 
and Sri Lanka, agriculture is the primary source of employment and income for much of the 
population. The agriculture and forestry sectors together account for as much as 54 percent 
of jobs, 29 percent of GDP, and 24 percent of capital stock for countries in this archetype. 
The result is fairly high transition-exposure scores, given the need to reduce the agriculture 
sector’s significant emissions, through both low-emissions farming practices and potentially 
adapting the sector’s production mix to fulfill changing local and global demands for food 
and crop-based fuel. Almost all countries in this group are also exposed to physical climate 
risk, which would subject their agricultural workforce to increased heat and humidity under 
warming scenarios. In addition, physical climate changes affect agricultural output, because 
higher temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns cause increasingly variable crop 
yields.289 Total emissions for these countries tend to be relatively low, on average 1.3 tCO₂ per 
capita versus a global average of 5.8 tCO₂ per capita.290 Consumer emissions from driving, 
heating, and cooking are also relatively low, at 0.2 tCO₂ per capita on average versus 1.1 tCO₂ 
per capita for the other countries in our analysis. While relatively low today, it is important to 
ensure that future economic growth can be secured through a low-emissions footprint, if the 
world is to achieve net-zero emissions.

McKinsey & CompanyOur analysis suggests that for countries with significant agriculture sectors, a net-zero 
transition would require a broad shift to low-GHG farming practices. Prior McKinsey research 
has identified a set of proven technologies and practices, which are already being deployed. 
They include electrification of farm equipment, manure management, the use of animal feed 
that cuts methane emissions, and reduced fertilizer usage.291 Many of these interventions 
that reduce emissions and increase carbon sequestration have the additional benefit of 
lower operating costs (for further details, see chapter 3), and improving resilience to physical 
climate changes, in turn leading to other benefits. For example, interventions such as 
agroforestry and improving the quality of inputs like seeds and fertilizers can help increase 
productivity and can lead to a sharp decline in deforestation and raise incomes.292

Scaling these practices across countries in this archetype will require significant capital 
spending and a concerted effort to reach millions of smallholder farmers. This capital 
spending will be needed to improve farmer access to high-quality inputs and improved farm 
technologies (such as electric farm equipment). Providing farmers with relevant skills and 
training will also be required to sustainably increase yields while simultaneously reducing 
emissions.293 For countries in this archetype, capital constraints may make it challenging 
to fund interventions that increase resilience to physical climate change, decarbonize the 
agriculture sector, and boost economic growth at the same time.

The net-zero transition presents other opportunities for countries in this archetype. When 
compared to the Current Policies scenario, the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario sees increased 
global demand for lower-emissions food sources, such as poultry, legumes, soybeans, 
and nuts, leading to new jobs and opportunities for farmers. Other sources of growth may 
be outside the agricultural sector altogether. For example, all countries belonging to this 
archetype are located in areas with high levels of solar irradiance: on average, they have a 
theoretical solar potential of more than five kWh per square meter of land per day. Scaling 
up solar energy generation capacity therefore represents a significant opportunity.294 Some 
countries also have relatively high abatement potential from reforestation and afforestation. 
Sri Lanka, for example, has abatement potential of 42 tCO₂ per square kilometer of land, 
per year. 

As with some other archetypes, these countries are expected to invest substantially in new 
assets as they grow their economies; this offers the potential to leapfrog and build out low-
emissions assets. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, would need to spend slightly 
more than 10 percent of GDP over the next decade in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. 

Land-use-intensive countries

This group includes Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, 
Honduras, Malaysia, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay, the economies of which depend, in large 
part, on their natural capital.295 Agriculture and forestry account for significant shares of their 
GDP (8 percent on average), jobs (15 percent on average, and almost 30 percent in countries 
such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Honduras), and capital stock (6 percent). The contribution of 
other sectors such as fossil fuel production, power, and industry to GDP, jobs, and capital 
stock is also sizable in some countries in the archetype. The agriculture and forestry sectors 
also present opportunities, as mentioned below.

and Peter Mannion, “Agriculture and climate change: Reducing emissions through improved farming practices,”

294 Lynn Bouchene, Ziyad Cassim, Hauke Engel, Kartik Jayaran, and Adam Kendall, “Green Africa: A growth and resilience 

agenda for the continent,” McKinsey & Company, October 28, 2021.

295 Large and diversified economies like Brazil could also face some of the transition exposure we have highlighted for other 

archetypes, as previously noted.

167

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringChanges to land use would have a key effect on these countries under the Net Zero 2050 
scenario, as these countries would need to curb deforestation or regulate the use of their 
existing forest area to lessen their CO₂ emissions. Reducing deforestation and practicing 
reforestation and afforestation could produce valuable carbon credits for sale in international 
markets. Forest protection and restoration would also affect forest-border communities, 
where livelihoods depend on the use of forestland. Options to consider for lessening the 
socioeconomic effects include supporting economic diversification, which could encompass 
developing activities associated with sustaining forests (see chapter 3 for further details). 

The agriculture sectors and workforces of these countries would also be affected. As with 
agriculture-based economies, a net-zero transition would involve mass adoption of low-
emissions agricultural practices, along with associated capital investments. Farmers could 
benefit as demand increases under a net-zero transition for low-emissions crops, such 
as cassava and sweet potato, some of which are cultivated extensively in these countries. 
Countries like Brazil, with a relatively large fossil resource sector, would also be affected by 
some of the issues described for that archetype.296

Countries in this archetype have options beyond forestry and other land use for deriving 
value from their natural capital in the Net Zero 2050 scenario. Most have significant solar 
potential, and some including Argentina have wind potential. Many of these countries are also 
endowed with the minerals that would be in demand under the net-zero scenario; Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, and Peru, for example, each have reserves greater than the current annual global 
production for certain minerals or rare-earth metals that will be important for manufacturing 
low-emission technologies. 

Downstream-emissions manufacturers

Countries in this archetype include Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, 
Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Korea, and Sweden. The phrase 
“downstream emissions” refers to the quantities of CO₂ that are emitted during the use of the 
goods these countries specialize in making. These goods include transportation equipment 
(for example, vehicles, vehicle components, and airplanes), industrial machinery (for example, 
kilns used in steelmaking and industrial boilers used in coal power), and household appliances 
(for example, gas stoves and gas boilers). 

For the average country in this group, the manufacturing of high-emissions products 
accounts for about 7 percent of jobs, 9 percent of GDP, and 8 percent of capital stock, and it 
also supports wider economic activity and exports. Our analysis shows that most countries in 
this group have transition-exposure scores in the middle of the overall range. 

In the Net Zero 2050 scenario, demand would shift toward products that emit less carbon 
when used. As a result, the manufacturing sectors in these countries could be exposed. 
Some automakers in these countries have begun preparing for this type of shift. A major 
transitional task for these countries in the net-zero scenario would likely be moving toward 
the manufacture of low-emissions products, reconfiguring supply chains, and reskilling the 
labor force. The effects could extend beyond the sectors directly touched by the transition. 
For example, Germany’s motor vehicle manufacturing sector provides approximately two 
indirect jobs for every direct job. Motor vehicles account for about 16 percent of Germany’s 
export value.297

296 Brazil is an example of a country for which the net-zero transition will have broader implications beyond its categorization 
in the land-use-intensive archetype. Its economy is one of the ten largest in the world. It also has a well-developed and 
diversified industrial sector, and its agricultural sector is a top global producer of some commodities, including soybeans 
and beef. Land-use change and agriculture account for about 50 percent of its emissions, while transportation represents 
about 20 percent and industry about 20 percent. For further details, see, for example, Ensuring greener economic growth 
for Brazil, Climate Policy Initiative, December 2018.

McKinsey & CompanySome countries in this group also face another sort of exposure: a substantial share of their 
manufacturing activity is in sectors with high-emissions operations, such as steel and cement. 
Their emissions-intensive manufacturers would need to adopt low-emissions processes or 
retrofit existing machinery and equipment during the net-zero transition.

Most of the growth potential for countries in this archetype would likely come from their 
technological capital, our analysis shows. They generally have high levels of R&D expenditure 
(an average of about 2 percent of GDP—almost double that of countries in other archetypes) 
and intellectual property associated with climate-change mitigation (an average of about 
1,700 relevant patents per country versus an average of about 450 for other countries). 
Their technical resources could allow these countries to redesign products and reengineer 
industrial operations for a net-zero future.

Services-based economies

Countries including Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Israel, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States have diversified economies oriented toward services sectors. Since 
these sectors have relatively low exposure to the net-zero transition, the overall transition 
exposure of these countries is also low. For the countries in this group, exposed sectors, 
on average, account for just 22 percent of jobs (versus 42 percent for the rest), 24 percent 
of GDP (versus 38 percent for the rest), and 21 percent of capital stock (versus 38 percent 
for the rest). Some countries in this category, such as the United States, also have midsize 
fossil fuel resource sectors and downstream-emissions manufacturing sectors (about 2 to 
3 percent of GDP).

While the aggregate economic exposure of these countries may be less than in other 
archetypes, communities that depend on exposed sectors could be disproportionately 
exposed under a net-zero transition. As previously noted, more than 10 percent of jobs in 
44 US counties are in the coal, oil and gas, fossil fuel power, and automotive sectors.298

According to our analysis, services-based economies are likely to experience shifts at the 
consumer level in the Net Zero 2050 scenario because they have high consumer emissions 
per capita (on average, around 12 tCO₂ per capita versus about 6 tCO₂ per capita for the rest). 
For households, this could mean adopting behavioral changes and spending more up-front on 
low-emissions goods including EVs. 

These countries could have promising opportunities related to low-emissions 
energy, especially wind. Their top-decile land areas for windiness have an average 
potential of 850 W/m2, compared with an average of about 580 W/m2 for top-decile areas 
in other countries. Some countries within the group that do not have as high wind potential, 
such as Israel, nevertheless have high solar potential. Services-based economies also have 
rich stocks of technological capital—their average R&D spend is about 2.3 percent of GDP, 
compared with about 1 percent for other countries, and their average number of patents 
related to climate-change mitigation is about 1,100, compared with about 550 for the rest. 
They can also provide services, such as financial or information services, in support of 
the transition.

Countries are exposed to the net-zero transition in highly uneven ways, in both the challenges 
they face and the opportunities they could seek to capture. Mapping these differences 
can help stakeholders understand where they may need to intervene to minimize risks and 
maximize their advantages. As we describe in the next chapter, global action, resolve, and 
unity would likely be needed to support economic and societal adjustments.

5. Managing the 

transition

As this report has shown, the economic transformation required to reach the goal of net-
zero emissions by 2050 is both universal and significant in scale, and it will be felt unevenly 
across sectors and countries. These characteristics of the transformation in turn raise major 
challenges for public- and private-sector leaders as they look to support an orderly transition, 
capture opportunities, and mitigate risks. 

Many of these adjustments can be best supported through coordinated action involving 
governments, businesses, and enabling institutions, and extending planning and investment 
horizons. This action would need to be taken in a spirit of unity for two key reasons: first, the 
universal nature of the transition means that all stakeholders will need to play a role. Every 
country and sector contributes to emissions either directly or indirectly through its role in 
global production and consumption systems. Second, the burdens of the transition will not 
be evenly felt, and the costs will be much more difficult for some stakeholders to bear than 
others. This is all the more challenging because contributions to emissions have not been 
even across stakeholder groups. Thus stakeholders would need to approach the transition 
with singular unity, resolve, and ingenuity.

In this final chapter, we review potential actions to manage the transition that leaders 
may want to consider. We first highlight broad areas of action to support adjustments 
to the transition. While these may not be exhaustive, they provide stakeholders with an 
overview of the range of actions which could be considered to enable the economic and 
societal adjustments that will be needed. We then examine how these broad actions 
could be undertaken by specific groups of stakeholders: companies, financial institutions, 
governments, enabling institutions, and individuals. In undertaking these and other actions, 
they will need to consider both risks and opportunities to their organizations and their 
stakeholders and determine the role they can play in supporting the necessary adjustments 
for all.299 

299 The actions described in this section specifically relate to the economic and societal adjustments needed for the 

transition, given the scope of this research. An effective response to climate change more broadly, we believe, will involve 
not only making economic and societal adjustments to deal with the effects of the net-zero transition, but also meeting 
the other fundamental requirements described in previous chapters. We identify seven categories of actions. Leaders 
can understand and commit to the transition, including understanding the fundamentals of climate science and the 
transition and making personal and professional commitments; assess and plan their actions, including through building 
risk assessment capabilities and establishing decarbonization plans; reduce and remove emissions in accordance with 
these plans; conserve and regenerate natural capital to support decarbonization; adapt and build resilience to manage 
the physical risk that is already locked in; reconfigure and grow, for example by reallocating capital and ramping down 
high-carbon businesses while scaling low-carbon ones; and seek to engage and influence their communities, across 
their investors, customers, suppliers, peers, and regulators. While the actions described in this chapter are specific to the 
economic and societal adjustments needed for the transition, they fall into the various categories listed above. For further 
details, see Mekala Krishnan, Tomas Nauclér, Daniel Pacthod, Dickon Pinner, Hamid Samandari, Sven Smit, and Humayun 
Tai, “Solving the net-zero equation: Nine requirements for a more orderly transition,” McKinsey & Company, October 2021.

171

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringThree broad economic and societal 
adjustments will be needed to 
support the net-zero transformation 

We describe potential actions with respect to the three types of economic and societal 
adjustments discussed in this report: effective capital reallocation and new financing 
structures, management of demand shifts and near-term unit cost increases, and 
compensating mechanisms to address socioeconomic impacts.

Catalyzing effective capital reallocation and new financing structures. As discussed, the 
net-zero transition will require both an increase in capital spending on low-emissions assets 
and the reallocation of capital from high-emissions assets to low-emissions assets. Several 
measures could help accelerate capital allocation, as follows:

 —  Scaling up climate finance. Many public and private financial institutions have committed 
to net-zero emissions and to funding activities that are integral to the net-zero transition. 
Significantly more financing will be needed. This could come from both traditional financial 
instruments and more specialized instruments such as green bonds, as discussed below. 
Partnerships between financial institutions and real-economy stakeholders can help 
marshal financing as well. 

 —  Developing new financial instruments and products. New financial products and 

structures can help companies wind down legacy assets and scale up new low-emissions 
assets. Among the possible solutions are special-purpose vehicles which enable 
companies to ring-fence legacy assets with high emissions and retire them in line with 
a net-zero pathway. They could also develop financing structures such as long-term 
purchase agreements from low-emissions plants, which have lower total life-cycle costs, 
to replace coal-generation assets, as well as new financial instruments, for example, for 
negative emissions or for nature-based solutions.

 —  Cultivating voluntary carbon markets. Developing and scaling voluntary carbon markets 
in the near term and compliance markets in the longer term could play a role in financing 
the transition. Carbon credits could become an important vehicle for financing the 
net-zero transition, to complement company efforts to decarbonize their operations. 
They could, for example, help channel capital to forest-rich developing countries where 
there is potential to prevent deforestation or plant new forests. Voluntary carbon markets 
would include markets both for avoidance credits (for example, to prevent forests from 
being cut down) and for removal credits (for example, from afforestation or direct air 
capture). For this to happen at scale, the world will need to build voluntary carbon markets 
that are large, transparent, verifiable, and environmentally robust.300 The Taskforce on 
Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets has estimated that demand for carbon credits could 
increase by a factor of 15 or more by 2030 and by a factor of up to 100 by 2050, and that 
the market for carbon credits could be worth upward of $50 billion in 2030.301 

 —  Pricing externalities to rebalance incentives. Governments might consider how various 
policies where organizations pay for their emissions could encourage capital spending 
in emissions-reduction projects. Carbon pricing could also generate revenue that 
governments might use to support the transition.

 —  Backstopping low-carbon investment and scaling up public finance. Public authorities or 
private companies could consider assuming some of the risk of investing in low-carbon 
projects so that investors will be more likely to finance them, through public guarantees 
or other risk hedges. This can help support capital flows to sectors and geographies with 
large financing gaps. Public finance on a national and global scale could be used to fund 

300 Final report, Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, January 2021.

McKinsey & Companykey infrastructure investment that provides positive impacts but may be more difficult to 
finance through markets (for example, EV charging stations, hydrogen fueling stations, 
and carbon sequestration).

 —  Funding the repurposing or decommissioning of redundant assets. Various options are 
available to organizations that wish to hasten the retirement of redundant assets. One 
proposed mechanism to accelerate the decommissioning of coal-fired power plants 
would involve purchasing plants so that they can be retired ahead of schedule, and then 
having the owners invest the proceeds in low-emissions energy projects.302 Multilateral 
or government funds could be used to manage the ramping down of emitting assets and 
minimize the value at risk from stranded assets.

Managing demand shifts and near-term unit cost increases. Our analysis suggests that 
demand for certain goods will change during the transition, along with companies’ capital and 
operating expenditures. Interventions on both the supply side and the demand side could help 
mitigate these effects.

 —  Building awareness and transparency around climate risks and opportunities. 

As organizations navigate the net-zero transition, they stand to benefit from identifying 
the risks and opportunities associated with physical climate hazards and transition 
impacts. Formal efforts to gauge climate risks are expanding. Among others, financial 
regulators including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are mandating 
climate-risk stress tests for financial institutions.303 

 —  Anticipating future competitive dynamics and making adjustments. As the basis of 

competition is altered, companies may need to overhaul their portfolios and business 
models and to identify new areas of opportunity from a net-zero economy. Governments 
would similarly need to consider exposure of their economies to the transition, as well as 
opportunities to benefit.

 —  Lowering technology costs with R&D. Some existing technologies that will be needed to 
achieve a net-zero economy by 2050 are not yet cost competitive with entrenched high-
carbon technologies. Technology gaps remain. Investment in R&D can help bring down 
technology costs, and various support models exist. In the United States, for example, the 
Department of Energy’s National Laboratories partner with private companies to drive 
R&D.304 

 —  Nurturing industrial ecosystems. To produce low-carbon technologies at a cost that 
permits their broad uptake, companies may need to develop capabilities through 
partnerships that are not part of existing value chains or through new business 
ecosystems. Governments can consider the role they might play in creating policy 
environments that are conducive to the formation and functioning of such ecosystems. 

 —  Identifying measures to manage cost increases. Organizations can identify a range of 

compensating mechanisms in cases where decarbonization actions increase costs and 
can understand which measures work best under different sets of circumstances and 
constraints. Examples include identifying opportunities to distribute the impact of cost 
increases along the value chain, partnering with suppliers to lower costs, and, where 
feasible, charging consumers a “green premium” or otherwise including this as part of the 
value proposition.

 —  Sending demand signals and creating incentives. Markets for emerging and still-
expensive low-emissions technologies are often too small and unpredictable for 
manufacturers to achieve economies of scale. Interventions to lift demand can lessen 
market risk and create the long-term certainty that encourages manufacturers to add 
production capacity.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringEstablishing compensating mechanisms to address socioeconomic impacts. The 
uneven impacts of the net-zero transition could be substantial and prove to be a major 
stumbling block if stakeholders feel that they are not protected from risk or given support in 
pursuing opportunities. The public and private sectors could consider taking the following 
measures to help enable adjustment to uneven impacts.

 —  Supporting economic development and diversification. Geographies could develop 
new low-emissions industries as demand wanes for fossil fuels and carbon-intensive 
industries. Some countries possess the natural capital to do so, for example, forest-rich 
countries that can promote reforestation to sequester carbon, create jobs, and secure 
financial inflows.305 Others will want to consider options for developing the technological, 
human, and physical capital to create these new sectors. 

 —  Enabling reskilling and redeployment of workers. Retraining workers for new tasks and 

ensuring that new entrants into the workforce have the right skills for the jobs needed in a 
low-carbon economy can help promote an inclusive transition. 

 —  Instituting support schemes (including insurance) for workers and consumers. Options 
for aiding displaced workers include income-support measures like unemployment 
protection and cash transfers, which can provide support while workers retrain and find 
jobs. Subsidies and other programs could also help consumers, especially low-income 
households, if the transition brings higher up-front capital expenditures or higher 
energy prices.

Stakeholders can play unique roles in 
supporting transition adjustments

To meet the challenges of the net-zero transformation, both the public and the private sectors 
would need to accelerate fundamental shifts in capabilities, cooperative models, and enabling 
institutions that span sectors and nations. Below, we summarize some of the roles that 
stakeholders in various groups can play to help foster a more orderly transition.

Companies can consider integrating climate considerations into their 
strategies and decision-making frameworks

Companies have begun to develop comprehensive plans for achieving net-zero emissions 
and to integrate those plans into their strategies, combining elements of what might be 
called “offense” (such as entering new markets, funding R&D, or participating in innovation 
ecosystems) and “defense” (divesting businesses or retrofitting high-emissions assets to 
lower their emissions). Here are some practices that companies can consider in order to help 
drive their organizations toward net-zero goals while also supporting broader economic and 
societal adjustments.

Articulating and communicating a coherent case for change, and upskilling employees. 
This will require a clear message from upper and middle management, with the CEO taking 
visible ownership and accountability for the sustainability agenda and the chief sustainability 
officer assuming an ever-broader mandate. Leaders will need to internalize the fundamentals 
of climate science and economics so they can understand both the imperative for the net-zero 
transition and its effect on their constituencies. 

305 McKinsey & Company and the World Economic Forum estimate that this reforestation solution could potentially 

generate emission reductions of about 7 GtCO₂ per year by 2030. See Daniel Aminetzah, Emily Birch, Julien Claes, 
Joshua Katz, Peter Mannion, Sebastien Marlier, and Dickon Pinner, “Why investing in nature is key to climate mitigation,” 
McKinsey & Company, January 2021.

McKinsey & CompanyDeveloping ongoing capabilities to make granular, holistic, and dynamic assessments 
of transition-related risks and opportunities. Companies in every industry will be exposed, 
to some degree, to risks and opportunities resulting from the net-zero transition. To stay 
abreast of developments related to climate change, organizations will likely need new and 
lasting capabilities to quantify their exposure and consider opportunities, data, infrastructure, 
and talent. Companies will benefit from developing the ability to conduct scenario-based 
modeling exercises that offer a probabilistic view of potential outcomes and their variations 
across sectors and geographies. Analytical models will need to encompass physical risks, 
the transition’s socioeconomic impacts, and competitive shifts. Companies may also want 
to benchmark exposure and opportunities in their direct operations as well as their supply 
chains, distribution channels, and broader business ecosystems relative to peers. Momentum 
has been growing toward public disclosures of information about climate risk, which could 
support both benchmarking efforts and effective capital allocation. In 2017, for example, the 
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures published detailed recommendations 
to help companies provide better climate-related information on four topics central to their 
operations: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics.306 A key part of this will also 
be better tracking of scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, including through the use of digital tools to 
increase transparency of emissions in companies’ own operations and in their supply chains.

Defining and evolving decarbonization plans as the competitive, financial, and 
regulatory landscape moves. This would include scope 1 and 2 emissions (with priority given 
to “no regret” actions such as improving energy efficiency and investing in decarbonization 
with positive returns). Where feasible, material, and needed, and depending on the nature 
of their operations, businesses can expand these plans to include scope 3 emissions. 
Such plans would encompass both operational transformations, including supported by 
digital technologies, and the decommissioning or repurposing of assets. Numerous steel 
producers, for example, are planning green-hydrogen and carbon-capture projects in line 
with goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier.307

Creating a portfolio of agile business strategies consistent with these decarbonization 
plans and with the risks and opportunities emerging in a net-zero economy. Companies 
can then put these plans in place as conditions change and opportunities arise. Repositioning 
for the net-zero economy could involve transformative changes such as investing in new 
physical assets, redesigning products, building new low-emissions businesses, revamping 
production processes, adjusting supply chains, reskilling workforces, and forming new 
partnerships. For example, some traditional automotive OEMs have announced plans to 
scale up production of electric vehicles.308 Companies will need to be agile as they reposition 
themselves, to plan for the future based on imperfect information while retaining the ability 
to dynamically adjust as conditions evolve. Some decarbonization actions, such as installing 
carbon capture, utilization, and storage equipment, increase operating costs, and affected 
companies may need to find opportunities to offset these cost increases elsewhere in their 
value chains. 

Integrating climate-related factors into all key business decisions. More broadly, 
executive teams may need to revisit their day-to-day business decisions and examine how 
the climate transition will affect decisions about strategy, risk management, finance and 
capital planning, R&D, product management, operations (including supplier management and 
procurement), organizational structure and talent management, pricing and marketing, and 
investor and government relations (Exhibit 30).

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringConsidering if and when to take a leadership position in the company’s industry and its 
ecosystem of investors, supply chains, customers, and regulators. In some instances, 
companies might find it easier to take the actions described above if they work with private- 
and public-sector organizations that have similar goals. Industry-level groups can help 
support voluntary commitments and appropriate policy and regulatory changes related to the 
transition. Businesses can also join forces to help countries, regions, and cities think about 
the potential impacts of a net-zero transition and how they will manage them. In Houston, 
Texas, the Greater Houston Partnership business coalition led a study examining approaches 
to possible shifts in primary-energy sectors, which are at the center of the city’s economy.309 

Financial institutions can support large-scale capital reallocation even 
as they manage individual risks and opportunities

In the near term, financial institutions will need to consider assessing and disclosing their 
risks as well as measuring and committing to reduce their financed emissions. Over time, 
they will need to translate these commitments into actions that lower emissions. Many banks, 
asset managers, insurers, private-equity firms, and other financial institutions have begun 
deploying capital in a way that supports the transition. Estimates from the Climate Policy 
Initiative suggest that public and private actors increased their climate investments in the last 
decade and global climate finance flows reached about $630 billion in 2019–20, a 70 percent 
increase since 2011–12.310 The scale of capital deployment to date, however, falls short of the 
spending need on physical assets suggested by our analysis of the NGFS Net Zero 2050 
scenario. Financial institutions could accelerate capital allocation by more widely adopting the 
following practices:

Rethinking conventions for risks and returns. Some decarbonization projects are likely 
to have longer payback periods than the projects that financial institutions and companies 
are accustomed to funding. This may compel financial institutions to adjust their criteria for 
which projects they finance—or, as discussed below, partner with other organizations to 
finance projects in new ways. Banks are also revisiting assumptions about risk as a result of 
climate change.311

Assessing and disclosing climate risks. As noted earlier in this chapter, some regulators 
now require banks to conduct climate-risk assessments. Based on these assessments, 
financial institutions could begin to incorporate climate factors into capital allocation, loan 
approvals, portfolio monitoring, and reporting. Ratings agencies are also incorporating 
climate factors into their assessments. Expectations from investors and the public are also 
spurring financial institutions to make more extensive disclosures of their climate risks and 
their responses to climate change and the net-zero transition. 

Measuring and reducing financed emissions. Banks and asset managers are increasingly 
making pledges to align their portfolios with 1.5°C or 2.0°C warming targets or to achieve 
net-zero financed emissions by a certain date. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero 
(GFANZ), for example, a global coalition in the United Nations’ Race to Zero, has brought 
together more than 450 financial institutions across 45 countries controlling assets of 
more than $130 trillion. These institutions have committed to manage investment, lending, 
underwriting, and financial service activities to net zero by 2050, along with other nearer-
term targets.312 They have started translating these commitments into targets for sectors and 
geographies. Given that emissions ultimately are from counterparties, financial institutions 
may find it helpful to support the transition plans of those counterparties—for instance, 
by offering new financial solutions, advising them on emissions-abatement methods, and 
introducing partnership opportunities.

McKinsey & CompanyTranslating commitments into actions that lower emissions. Over time, to meet their 
commitments and take advantage of opportunities, financial institutions could consider 
the scale-up of climate finance and expand the range of climate-finance products and 
services, such as funding for low-emissions power projects, new financial instruments to 
support negative emissions or nature-based solutions, and well-governed voluntary carbon 
markets.313 For example, Temasek and BlackRock teamed up to launch Decarbonization 
Partners, which is designed to launch late-stage venture capital funds and private-equity 
growth funds focused on decarbonization solutions.314 Some financial institutions are enabling 
customers to support climate action, for example through offering depositors the option of 
earmarking their money to fund green projects. 

Governments and multilateral institutions could establish incentives, 
support vulnerable stakeholders, and foster collective action

Public-sector organizations have a unique role in managing uneven impacts on sectors 
and communities, in part by balancing numerous economic, environmental, and social 
considerations. Leaders could respond effectively by considering the following options, often 
in partnership with the private sector.

Assessing exposure to risks and opportunities, developing decarbonization plans, and 
creating net-zero strategies. This would include building some of the capabilities described 
previously for businesses. Governments might consider bringing climate considerations into 
decisions about urban planning, infrastructure development, and tax and subsidy regimes, 
among others. To support such activity, for example, the UK government in 2008 established 
the Climate Change Committee, a statutory body that advises the government on emissions 
targets, helps it adapt to the impact of climate change (including transition risks), and reports 
to Parliament on the progress of the climate transition.315 One major adjustment will be 
developing new low-emissions industries to capture opportunities from a net-zero economy. 
As described in chapter 4, some countries and regions possess natural capital and could 
develop technological, human, and physical capital to create these new sectors. 

Using policy measures, regulation, and other measures to support decarbonization 
actions across sectors. Potential mechanisms to consider include subsidies, grants, 
guarantees, taxes and carbon prices, demand signals, standards, and accreditation.316 One 
example is a carbon price which could be set with a tax on the distribution, sale, or use of fossil 
fuels based on their carbon content, or with quotas in cap-and-trade systems that set an 
overall limit on emissions and create tradable emissions permits. Governments can also play a 
role in accelerating research and development that would lower technology costs.

Establishing multilateral and government funds to support low-carbon investment 
and manage stranded-asset risk. For large institutional investors such as pension funds, 
investing in low-carbon projects involves complex risks. Blended-finance mechanisms 
can help mitigate investment risk and “crowd in” private finance to a variety of projects. 
Development banks use these mechanisms to inject their own capital into projects and attract 
other investors. According to a 2019 report, blended-finance deals have totaled $10 billion 
to $20 billion a year globally since 2010. Of this amount, 36 percent supports climate action, 
one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.317 The Green Climate Fund, created by the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is one of the largest blended-
finance facilities, with $30 billion of funding divided equally between climate-change 
mitigation and adaptation, and 173 approved projects since 2015.318 

313 Voluntary carbon markets would include markets for avoidance credits (for example, to prevent forests from being cut 

down) and for removal credits (for example, from afforestation or direct air capture). For further details, see Final report, 
Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, January 2021.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringEuropean development finance institutions have also committed to align portfolios with the 
Paris Agreement.319 For example, Norway’s Norfund has invested nearly 50 percent of its 
portfolio in the clean-energy sector.320

Instituting reskilling, redeployment, and social support programs for workers and 
managing negative effects on lower-income consumers. Governments have various 
options when it comes to retraining workers for the jobs needed in a low-carbon economy, 
ensuring that new entrants into the workforce have appropriate skills, and supporting 
workers who are making job transitions. The Scottish government, for example, worked 
with the national skills agency to retrain and reskill oil and gas workers after the closure of 
a number of facilities in the sector—enabling 89 percent of participants to find new jobs.321 
Social support programs can also assist displaced workers. Similarly, governments can play 
a role in supporting lower-income consumers, for example via subsidies or managing energy 
price increases.

Collaborating with other stakeholders to drive collective action. Governments can create 
or influence enabling institutions in constructive ways. Governments can also take leading 
roles in coordinating industrial-development efforts among stakeholders. In 2019, for 
example, South Korea’s government published the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap to establish 
a national hydrogen ecosystem spanning three segments: upstream hydrogen infrastructure, 
hydrogen-fueling stations, and hydrogen vehicles.322

Enabling institutions such as standard setters, industry groups, and 
civil-society coalitions will be critical in coordinating action

The pace and scale of the transition mean that existing institutions may need to be revamped 
and new institutions created to disseminate knowledge, support capital deployment, 
manage uneven impacts, and organize collective action. Here are some areas where enabling 
institutions are well positioned to play valuable roles; more will no doubt emerge as the 
transition progresses.

Developing and enforcing governing standards, tracking, and market mechanisms. 
Standards and regulations can promote uniformity and consistency for practices such as 
measuring emissions, disclosing physical and transition risks, reporting on climate finance 
flows, validating carbon credits, and trading on voluntary carbon markets. For example, 
standards would be needed to measure, track, and ensure the traceability of scope 1, 2, and 
3 emissions, supported through digital tools. Governing standards can help stakeholders 
factor emissions information into pricing and investment decisions, consumer choices, and 
regulatory and global trade regimes. The Science Based Targets initiative, for example, 
seeks to provide global standards for corporate net-zero targets, and the Partnership for 
Carbon Accounting Financials works on standards for measuring the emissions generated by 
financial institutions’ investment and lending portfolios.323

McKinsey & CompanyConvening stakeholders and facilitating collaboration. Industry and geographic forums 
can help disseminate best practices, arrange collective investment, shift value chains, and 
organize the build-out of infrastructure. They can also help organizations synchronize their 
responses to transition risks, so that none is exposed to the first-mover risk of adopting 
practices or making investments that raise the prices of their goods or services while peer 
companies’ prices remain stable. The Mission Possible Partnership, for example, brings 
more than 200 heavy-industry experts together with banks and governments to create 
investment-grade net-zero strategies for high-emissions sectors like aviation, shipping, steel, 
and cement.324

Elevating risks and opportunities for workers and communities. Civil-society institutions 
can help integrate the voices of affected communities into decision making. In Canada, 
union leaders participated in the Task Force on Just Transition for Canadian Coal Workers 
and Communities. The task force’s recommendations helped spur the government 
to expand employment insurance, training and education vouchers, and grants to 
affected communities.325

Individuals can manage their own exposure to the transition and play 
powerful roles as consumers and citizens 

Unless individuals support the economic and societal adjustments that a net-zero transition 
would require, the transition will be unlikely to take place. In the long run, people stand 
to benefit greatly from a successful effort to limit global warming to 1.5°C, because such 
an effort would ameliorate physical risks and give rise to a host of new technologies. But 
individuals will also need to play a role in the economic and societal adjustments needed 
for the transition.326 The following are some of the ways that individuals can support 
those adjustments.

Understanding exposure to risks and opportunities. Households may experience cost 
decreases in some cases and cost increases in others. Given the scale of the job gains and 
losses we noted in this report, people in some exposed occupations may need to learn new 
skills and practices to find work in a net-zero society. More broadly, the communities where 
individuals live may need to adjust as regions look to navigate the net-zero transition.

Shifting consumption patterns to support a net-zero transition. Reaching net zero would 
require households to adopt new patterns of consumption, such as switching to electric 
vehicles, renovating or retrofitting homes for energy efficiency, or eating less meat like beef 
and lamb to reduce agricultural emissions. This will be easiest where substitutes at the same 
or lower price are readily available. Consumers may face higher up-front capital costs in 
some cases, such as buying electric vehicles or retrofitting buildings but will likely achieve 
some ongoing cost savings from these choices. Even so, higher up-front costs can prove to be 
more challenging for lower-income households.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringEngaging in civic discourse. An informed public that recognizes the imperative for a net-
zero transition could spur more decisive and transformative action on the part of government 
and business leaders. This would require a greater recognition of the magnitude of the 
challenge, along with a greater willingness to make adjustments in daily life and to accept 
solutions that might have been unappealing in the past. It would also require people to 
support compensating mechanisms for those who are negatively affected and to hold leaders 
accountable for the effects of their actions on future generations. 

As this report has outlined, a transition to net-zero emissions amounts to a huge and complex 
undertaking, given its universal and very significant nature, and the unevenness that is likely 
to characterize it, based on our analysis. The challenges for leaders in business and policy 
in seeing through such a transition, and ensuring that it is orderly, should not be understated. 
Yet, as we have endeavored to show, the transition itself would bring opportunities. And the 
end result of a successful transformation to a low-emissions world would be immense. This is 
not just in terms of the substantial dislocation that would be avoided by ending the buildup 
of physical climate risk, but also in terms of opening up the prospect of a fundamentally 
transformed global economy with lower energy costs, and numerous other benefits—for 
example, improved health outcomes and enhanced conservation of natural capital. Moreover, 
the level of global cooperation that such a transition will ultimately require could serve as 
both a model and a basis for solving a broader array of global challenges. The findings of this 
research serve as a clear call for more thoughtful and decisive action, taken with the utmost 
urgency, to secure a more orderly transition to net zero. Daunting as the task may seem, it is 
fair to assume that human ingenuity would ultimately rise to the challenge of achieving net 
zero, just as it has solved other seemingly intractable problems over the past 10,000 years. 
The key issue is whether the world can muster the requisite boldness and resolve to broaden 
its response during the next decade or so, which will in all likelihood decide the nature of 
the transition.

Technical appendix

This appendix gives details of the methodology and sources used in this report. It is organized 
in four sections, as follows:

1.  Overview of methodology and key uncertainties

2.  Quantification of overall economic shifts:

A.  Demand

B.  Capital spending and stranded assets

C.  Costs

D.  Jobs 

3.  Analysis of exposure of sectors across the economy

4.  Analysis of countries’ exposure and opportunities 

1.  Overview of methodology and key uncertainties

We assess the transition along two dimensions: energy and land-use systems, and 
geographies. For the first, we examine energy and land-use systems that account for about 
85 percent of global CO₂ emissions: power, mobility (in particular, road transportation), 
industry (steel and cement production), buildings, agriculture and food, and forestry and other 
land use. We also look at fossil fuels, hydrogen, and biofuels that supply energy to many of 
these systems. For the geographic dimension, we analyze effects in 69 countries, which make 
up about 95 percent of global GDP. 

We performed the analysis as follows. First, we used climate scenarios to quantify changes 
in important activity level variables in each energy and land-use system (further details 
below). Based on the evolution of such variables—which include changes in production and 
production capacity—we then assessed the implications for capital stock and investment, 
producer and consumer costs, and employment based on information about decarbonization 
technologies and their capital and operating costs, labor intensity, and value chains. 
Where possible, we used region-specific costs and labor assumptions, as well as expected 
technology learning curves over time, based on McKinsey analysis. 

We chose not to develop our own transition scenarios and rely instead on widely used 
scenarios created by other institutions. Specifically, we analyze potential effects under the 
Net Zero 2050 scenario defined by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). 
This hypothetical scenario mirrors global aspirations to cut emissions by about half by 2030 
and to net zero by 2050 to give an even chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C by the end of 
the century. This is achieved on a global basis. This means some high-emissions activities in 
hard to abate sectors and particular regions do not fall to zero by the middle of the century. 
Residual CO₂ emissions from these activities are counterbalanced by removals such as 
through land restoration and the use of bioenergy with CCS in the scenario. 

185

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringWe chose to work with the NGFS scenarios because they cover all major energy and land-use 
systems in a coherent manner, provide regional granularity, are designed for use in risk and 
opportunity analysis, and are becoming the standard scenarios used by financial institutions, 
regulators, and supervisors.327

In some cases, as a counterfactual for comparison, we also use the NGFS Current Policies 
scenario. This scenario anticipates warming of a little over 3°C by 2100. The NGFS Current 
Policies scenario includes some degree of transformation of the economy toward lower 
emissions, based on today’s mitigation policies (based on an NGFS assessment of policies 
as of the start of 2020), and expected cost reductions in key low-emissions technologies. 
The comparison allows us to account for how other factors such as GDP growth or population 
growth could affect the economy between now and 2050.

The NGFS scenarios are generated by three different detailed energy and land-use system 
integrated assessment models that have also been used to inform mitigation pathway 
research cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We used the results 
from the REMIND MAgPIE 2.1/-4.2 model in this research; this is because of the granularity 
it provides for agriculture. These scenarios broadly cover 12 regions: Australia, Canada and 
New Zealand; China; India; Japan; “Other Asia,” which includes, among others, South Korea 
and Southeast Asia; United States; Latin America; the 27 European Union members and 
the United Kingdom; “Other Europe,” which includes, among others, Switzerland, Norway, 
and Turkey; Russia, Ukraine, and the Commonwealth of Independent States; Middle East 
and North Africa; and sub-Saharan Africa. The full list of countries can be found on the 
NGFS website.

The NGFS scenarios capture how different economic, energy, land-use, and climate variables 
may change under different climate policy responses. We relied on these variables, alongside 
further downscaling from Vivid Economics, as inputs into our quantification of overall 
economic shifts, as described below. 

Limitations of our approach and uncertainties. We recognize the limitations of the NGFS 
scenarios, as with any transition scenario, given that this is an emerging field of research. 
First, while some variables are explored at the sector level, the scenarios sometimes do not 
provide enough detail to explore how different types of activities will be affected. Second, the 
models underpinning the NGFS scenarios may not capture important dynamics or constraints 
within a sector. For example, the model we used favors more economy-wide use of biomass 
in energy and industry (for example, hydrogen production) than may be considered feasible 
in other sector-specific decarbonization pathways. Third, although the models do capture 
ongoing learning and technological innovation, they may fail to sufficiently anticipate the 
emergence of disruptive technologies that may change decarbonization pathways and of cost 
trajectories that fall faster than anticipated. Fourth, while some NGFS scenarios have begun 
to incorporate damages from physical risks in the economic modeling, further work is needed 
to fully integrate physical risks into the decarbonization pathways. As a result, we have 
focused here on scenarios that do not incorporate physical risk. This approach also allows 
us to focus our analysis on the effects of the transition alone. Finally, the scenarios reflect 
existing climate policies and technological trends in place before the COVID-19 pandemic and 
climate negotiations and pledges at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021.

Our analysis concentrates largely on first-order effects. Various uncertainties could influence 
the magnitude of the outcomes highlighted here. While some of these factors could result in 
lower outcomes than those sized in this research, most factors suggest that additional costs 
and effects will likely occur as the transition unfolds. By the same token, the costs of physical 
climate risks could prove higher than those described in this research. 

327 See NGFS Climate Scenarios for central banks and supervisors, Network for Greening the Financial System, June 2021. 
Some jurisdictions such as the European Union, Japan, and the United States reach net zero for all greenhouse gases by 
2050 under this scenario.

McKinsey & CompanyKey uncertainties include the following:

 — Warming scenario and emissions pathway. A higher warming scenario (for example, 2.0°C 
above preindustrial levels) may lead to smaller transition effects than a 1.5°C warming 
scenario, given the lower degree of emissions reduction and thus deviation from today’s 
production and consumption patterns it entails (though physical risks would naturally 
be higher). 

 — Sectors’ decarbonization actions and activity levels. Because the focus of our 

work is assessing the nature and magnitude of economic shifts and not identifying 
decarbonization actions, we used a prespecified net-zero scenario from NGFS. It is 
feasible that an alternate technology mix could result in lower costs and lesser shifts 
than those described here, and that further technological innovation could result in a 
different pathway with lower costs. For instance, an alternate scenario may incorporate 
substantially more use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies and a focus on 
decarbonizing the hydrocarbon value chain. For example, this could happen if capture 
costs fall, regulatory frameworks are put in place to incentivize CCS use, and markets 
mature for recycled CO₂ as a material feedstock. Indeed CCS may play an increasingly 
important role if the scale-up of renewables proves slower or more disorderly than 
many anticipate. 

 — Magnitude of direct and indirect socioeconomic effects. Some effects could be larger 
than described here, for example, if executing the transition is more complex than the 
scenario here suggests, and additional capital spending is needed to maintain flexibility 
and redundancy in energy systems. Similarly, higher-order effects could substantially 
increase risks, particularly in the short term. For example, depending on how the transition 
is financed, the effects on the overall economy could be substantially higher than sized 
here. Finally, effects could also be larger under an abrupt or delayed transition.

 — Economic and societal adjustments needed for the transition. Costs and investments 

could be higher than sized here, for example to implement social support schemes to aid 
economic and societal adjustments. Similarly, additional costs may arise from delays, 
setbacks, and urgently needed adaptation measures, particularly if restricting warming 
to 1.5°C proves not to be possible. For our analysis, we quantify the scale of first-order 
effects and describe qualitatively the adjustments needed.

Aspects we did not cover. Topics we did not cover include the likelihood, validity, and 
comparative costs associated with various decarbonization scenarios; the comparative merits 
of different emissions-reduction technologies; constraints on implementing and deploying 
decarbonization technologies (for example, scaling up supply chains); actions needed to drive 
and incentivize decarbonization; higher-order economic effects of the transition, including 
on output, growth, and human well-being; relative costs and merits of decarbonization and 
adaptation; and impacts that could result from physical climate hazards. We use benchmarks 
from the external literature and our past research to describe these latter possibilities.

As discussed above, our analysis here represents first-order estimates. Fully quantifying the 
costs of rising physical risks and the transition is complex. It would require estimating impacts 
from rising physical risks and the cost of adaptation actions, building robust estimates of 
the impact of the net-zero transition on the economy that take into account the higher-
order effects described above, and doing so over time and while grappling with the various 
uncertainties described previously.

187

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring2. Quantification of overall economic shifts

A. Demand
Where possible, we take detailed activity-level demand data directly from the NGFS 
scenarios, for instance power capacity by production route (including coal, wind, and solar). 
NGFS provides these variables in five-year intervals, for example 2020 and 2025. For years in 
between, where needed, we interpolated linearly between data points. 

Where the level of granularity is not sufficient or different activity-level measures are 
required, Vivid Economics downscaled the NGFS variables to provide additional insights. 
The downscaling was based on the relationship between NGFS and required variables from 
Vivid’s proprietary models and open source models (for example VESM), as well as other 
industry benchmarks, as relevant. For example, Vivid estimates new vehicle sales, stocks, 
and kilometers by vehicle type from NGFS final energy use for transportation. This is done 
for a number of different vehicle types (for example, cars, light and heavy-duty trucks, buses, 
two- and three-wheelers) and power trains (for example, battery-electric vehicles, internal 
combustion engines, fuel cell electric vehicles). A similar approach was taken for buildings 
and industry using relevant proxies for activity levels in those systems. For agriculture, Vivid 
Economics estimated agriculture production from internal runs of the MAgPIE model. In 
such cases where downscaled variables were developed, we still refer to the specific sector 
variable as being based on the relevant NGFS scenario.

B. Capital spending 
We estimated capital spending using activity levels in six energy and land-use systems in 
US dollars at 2020 market exchange rates. The general approach was to calculate spending 
on physical assets for each of the 12 regions in the NGFS data set and then aggregate total 
spending to the global level. In some parts of the report, this is represented as a fraction of 
GDP by dividing spending in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario by GDP levels in each year. 
In all cases, total capital spending is estimated by multiplying the relevant activity-level 
production or capacity metrics (for example, capacity additions) by unit capital costs. In most 
cases, unit capital costs are broken out across the NGFS regions described previously. 

This estimation includes spending on physical assets on various forms of energy supply (for 
example, power systems, hydrogen, and biofuel supply), energy demand (for example, for 
vehicles and alternate methods of steel and cement production), and various forms of land 
use (for example, GHG-efficient farming practices). This includes what is typically considered 
as investment in national accounts as well as spending, in some cases, on consumer durables 
such as personal cars. We typically consider spending to replace physical assets at the point 
of emissions (for example, cars for mobility); additional spending would also occur through the 
value chain. We have not sized this, to minimize double counting.

Others have estimated spending needs for the net-zero transition, and typically find ranges of 
$3.0 trillion–$4.5 trillion.328 These evaluations often include an assessment of the spending 
needed in primary energy, power, hydrogen, biofuels, and energy efficiency, and the cost of 
electrifying components in end-use sectors such as buildings, transportation, and mobility. 
We broadened our scope relative to what is typically sized to include a more comprehensive 
view of spending by households and businesses on assets that use energy (for example, the 
full cost of passenger cars and heat pumps), capital expenditures in agriculture and forestry, 
and some continued spending on high-emissions physical assets like fossil fuel–based 
vehicles and power assets, as the economy transitions. Our estimates are thus higher than 
those in the literature.

328 See Net Zero by 2050: A roadmap for the global energy sector, IEA, 2021; NGFS climate scenarios for central banks 

and supervisors, NGFS, 2021; Christoph Bertram et al., “Energy system developments and investments in the decisive 
decade for the Paris Agreement goals,” Environmental Research Letters, volume 16, number 7, June 2021; and David 
McCollum et al., “Energy investment needs for fulfilling the Paris Agreement and achieving the Sustainable Development 
Goals,” Nature Energy, volume 3, June 2018. The Energy Transitions Commission find incremental spending needs are 
$1.5 trillion–$1.8 trillion per year, which is also within the $3 trillion–$4.5 trillion range cited for total spending needs. See 
Making mission possible: Delivering a net-zero economy, Energy Transitions Commission, September 2020. In 2014 the 
Global Commission on the Economy and Climate with an expanded scope more similar to this report found investment 
needs of around $6 trillion between 2015 and 2030 but much smaller incremental spending needs. See Better growth, 
getter climate: The new climate economy report, The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, 2014.

McKinsey & CompanyOur analysis divides high-emissions assets from low-emissions assets. Low-emissions assets 
have a relatively small emissions footprint; the term does not always mean carbon neutral. 
This segmentation was done to allow us to size the scale of capital reallocation needed for 
the net-zero transition. In doing so, we recognize that the demarcation between high and 
low emissions is not always clear. Low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure include 
assets for blue-hydrogen production with CCS; green-hydrogen production using electricity 
and biomass; biofuel production; generation of wind, solar, hydro-, biomass, gas with CCS, 
and nuclear power, along with transmission and distribution and storage infrastructure; heat 
production from low-emissions sources such as biomass; steel furnaces using the electric 
arc furnace (EAF) method of steel production, direct reduced iron (DRI) with hydrogen, 
basic oxygen furnaces with CCS; cement kilns with biomass or fossil-fuel kilns with CCS; 
low-emissions vehicles and supporting infrastructure; heating equipment for buildings run on 
electricity or biomass such as heat pumps; district heating connections; cooking technology 
not based on fossil fuels; building insulation; GHG-efficient farming practices; food crops, 
poultry and egg production; and land restoration.

We perform the following specific calculations for individual areas:

Fossil fuels, hydrogen, and biofuels
We take capital investment for fossil fuels at the worldwide level for extraction and conversion 
of coal, gas, and oil directly from the NGFS REMIND MAgPIE 2.1/-4.2 model (shortened to 
NGFS below). This includes investments in mining, shipping, ports, refining, and transmission 
and distribution as relevant. 

Hydrogen demand was sized using the NGFS assumptions on secondary energy production 
on the regional and global levels. Production from NGFS is split into several pathways 
including from electricity, biofuels with and without CCS, natural gas with and without CCS, 
and coal with and without CCS. This does not include hydrogen production by industry for 
feedstock. We assume that the change in production levels is a good proxy for capacity 
additions in the future, given the size of market growth and asset life of facilities. We 
take costs for hydrogen production for each pathway from McKinsey Hydrogen Insights. 
This uses a representative average facility location for each production route as a proxy to 
assume global costs. 

Biofuels demand was sized using the NGFS assumptions on future production levels and 
capital costs for biofuels with and without CCS on the regional and global level. We estimate 
biofuels capacity additions from production-level changes. As with hydrogen, we assume no 
renewal capacity given the young age of assets and size of market growth. 

Power. We take capacity additions by production route directly from the NGFS, for instance 
coal, gas with and without CCS, solar and wind, and required storage capacity. We take capital 
costs for generation and storage technologies directly from McKinsey Power Solutions. 
Unit capital costs take into account costs of building, manufacturing, and maintaining power 
assets by country and production route. In addition, we take transmission and distribution 
investments directly from NGFS. This was benchmarked relative to transmission and 
distribution estimates from other sources, for example, the IEA.

For the power sector, we also conducted an assessment of stranded assets. Stranded 
value represents the cumulative value of prematurely retired and underutilized assets in 
2020–50, undiscounted. We estimate it by first identifying the level of yearly depreciation 
that is expected given asset life and assumed economic life using data from the WRI Global 
Power Plant database as input. That figure was multiplied by the fraction of assets that are 
underutilized relative to past average utilization rates (between 2005 and 2020) and summed 
across years.   

Industry (steel and cement)
For steel, Vivid Economics downscaled NGFS scenarios to create specific production routes, 
including blast oxygen furnaces with and without CCS, electric arc furnaces, and direct 
reduced irons (biogas and hydrogen). We take capital costs from McKinsey Basic Materials 
Insights. Capital costs include maintenance and growth capital expenditures. 

189

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringFor cement, Vivid Economics downscaled NGFS scenarios to create production routes, 
including coal, gas, biomass, coal with fly ash substitution, gas with fly ash substitution, coal 
with CCS, gas with CCS, coal with CCS, and fly ash substitution and gas with CCS, and fly ash 
substitution kilns. We take capital costs from McKinsey Sustainability Insights. Capital costs 
include maintenance and growth capital expenditures. 

Road mobility
Vivid downscaled NGFS data to create estimates of new vehicle sales by type (including 
cars, light and heavy-duty trucks, buses, two- and three-wheelers) and powertrain (for 
example, battery-electric vehicles, internal combustion engine, fuel cell electric vehicles). 
We take up-front costs per vehicle and the cost of installing electric and hydrogen charging 
infrastructure from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility Electrification Model. 

Buildings
Vivid Economics provided sales data for each category. We take unit cost data from McKinsey 
Sustainability Insights that include the cost of buying unit, labor cost for installation, and 
construction. Up-front costs for heat pumps are assumed to be a weighted average of the 
costs for air-source, water-source, and ground-source heat pumps by sales. Fossil fuel boilers 
are assumed to be a weighted average of gas and oil boilers. District heating costs represent 
the costs of installing a new district heating connection in the property as well as centralized 
infrastructure costs for the connection from the property to heat source (for example, a heat 
plant or ground-source heat pump). Costs in developing regions are assumed to be half those 
of developed regions, due to limited availability of granular data across regions. 

Agriculture, forestry, and other land use 
Agriculture. We quantified the investment from implementing 25 GHG-efficient farming 
techniques and technologies outlined by other McKinsey research.329 For agricultural 
production, Vivid Economics downscaled NGFS scenarios to create production variables. We 
take estimates for the capital costs for production and costs of implementing GHG efficient 
practices from McKinsey’s Agricultural Practice. Capital costs capture spending on new farm 
equipment and infrastructure, as well as costs to maintain existing equipment. 

Forestry and other land use. We estimate deforestation rates from the NGFS scenarios 
taking into account changes in NGFS forest cover, and afforestation rates and the wider 
literature on natural forest growth rates. The amount of avoided deforestation is the 
difference between deforested area in the NGFS Current Policies and Net Zero 2050 
scenarios. To estimate capital spending we use projected costs (in US dollars per hectare) 
by country and type of project (for example, avoided deforestation and afforestation) from 
McKinsey Nature Analytics and multiply by area of land protected or restored. Investment 
costs consist mainly of land acquisition costs (both explicit costs to purchase land and implicit 
imputed rents of protecting land) and some one-off costs such as setting up offices and 
site preparation. 

C. Costs
We sized the change in unit production costs to model the impact on producers in individual 
systems. We calculate unit cost of production as in-year operating expenditure plus in-year 
maintenance capital spending (the yearly expenses incurred to maintain equipment) plus 
capital charges and depreciation on the invested capital base of the sector. The unit cost of 
production is then computed by dividing cost of production by volume of production. This is 
done at the worldwide level and is meant to be an indicator of how costs of production may 
change for the average producer. Individual producers could see a different change to their 
cost of production based on many other factors. These include where they are located, what 
their main production routes are, and what regulation they face in their given jurisdiction(s). 
We used a weighted cost of capital of 8 percent to calculate capital charges for steel and 
cement and 6.5 percent for the power sector. This is in line with global averages in the power,

calculated relative to 2020 levels, which we sometimes refer to as “today.”

For power, operating costs include the full in-year costs of energy (mainly electricity), 
operation and maintenance (including labor, spare parts, replacement of the technology), 
and water. We estimated the delivered cost of electricity. Data are sourced from McKinsey 
Power Solutions. For cement and steel, operating costs include those for feedstock, energy, 
and other operating costs. Data are sourced from McKinsey Sustainability Insights and 
McKinsey–Mission Possible Partnership collaboration.  

We also examined the total cost of ownership data from McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. 
Total cost of ownership accounts for purchase price, operating costs, for instance fuel and 
maintenance costs, and resale value; based on three-year ownership of a new car.

In conducting these analyses, we largely focus on the impact of shifts in demand across 
different energy and land-use systems with different economics of production. We exclude 
any impact of shifting subsidies or carbon taxes, which result in transfers across different 
actors in the economy. We also excluded any effects of rising physical risks on costs.

D. Jobs
We measure the total direct and indirect operation and maintenance (O&M) and construction 
and manufacturing (capital expenditures) job impacts (losses and gains) from the net-
zero transition. Our analysis captures potential effects of shift in demand for jobs across 
subsectors, sectors, and geographies; we refer to rising demand for jobs as “jobs gained,” 
and diminishing demand for jobs as “jobs lost.” In reality, this could manifest as a shift in job 
activity for individual workers. To do this, we only considered jobs in existing sectors that are 
directly affected by the climate transition, in new sectors that might emerge as a result of the 
net-zero transition, and in their upstream sectors. Job losses and gains are modeled for every 
five-year increment between 2020 and 2050.

The transition to net zero will not be the only global trend affecting employment between 
2020 and 2050. Significant shifts are likely across all job sectors as a result of trends 
including population growth, sector-specific productivity enhancements, rising incomes, an 
aging population, and technological disruptions from automation and AI adoption.330 Given 
these factors, we sought to disaggregate job gains and losses specifically associated with 
achieving net-zero emissions under the Net Zero 2050 scenario. When transition-related job 
changes are referred to in this report, figures include both technological and policy changes 
already planned or in the process of implementation as well as incremental changes required 
to achieve net zero by 2050. Figures exclude changes associated with the macroeconomic 
and within-sector productivity trends outlined above.

In an effort to describe a comprehensive view of job transitions tied to achieving net zero 
by 2050, calculations for gross job losses and gains include new jobs created (for example, 
CCS jobs that do not currently exist), current jobs lost (for example, coal mining jobs, which 
are likely to decline), jobs shifting between subsectors within a given sector (for example, a 
job that shifts from coal to solar power generation counts as both one job lost and one job 
gained), and jobs being lost or gained across regions. While many such job losses and gains 
will occur between now and 2050 across the economy as a whole, job losses and gains 
analyzed in this report are focused on sectors within the energy and land-use systems most 
closely tied to achieving the net-zero transition. Thus, for various reasons, this analysis does 
not capture broad labor market shifts expected over the next three decades, but narrowly 
focuses on the shifts from a net-zero transition alone.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringOur methodology does not account for any higher-order impacts and assumes an orderly 
transition, one in which high emissions assets are ramped down and low emissions assets 
are ramped up to the levels needed without constraints or challenges. We do not consider 
challenges associated with the reskilling or redeployment of workers, as this analysis 
captures the demand for employment in the economy. Finally, employment levels will also 
depend on fiscal and monetary policy that could be constrained by the aggregate financing 
requirement, which we do not model. This analysis has numerous uncertainties and we have 
needed to make assumptions, for example related to productivity growth within sectors and 
subsectors, and relative productivity levels across different technologies.

Throughout our discussion we account for both the jobs in our focus sectors (direct jobs) 
and the upstream jobs associated with final demand in our focus sectors (indirect jobs). The 
indirect jobs are calculated using multipliers derived from input-output tables that account for 
local and imported inputs to production in our focus sectors. 

Operations and maintenance (O&M) jobs relate to the operations and maintenance activities in 
the sector (direct jobs), and their supply chains (indirect jobs). Direct O&M jobs are permanent, 
full-time positions in the affected sectors. Indirect O&M jobs are permanent, full-time jobs 
in all the sectors that provide inputs and services used in production in the directly affected 
sectors (for example, transportation, financial services).

Capital expenditures jobs are those arising from capital investment in the sector, are 
associated with manufacturing and construction (direct jobs), and their supply chains (indirect 
jobs), and are not included in either the baseline jobs figure for 2020 or the O&M losses and 
gains across sectors. Direct capital expenditures jobs are temporary, full-time jobs created 
in construction and manufacturing as a result of capital investment in the directly affected 
sectors (for example, to build low-emissions capacity in power). These jobs are calculated 
based on the amount of investment in a given year, and attributed fully to the year in which 
the capital investment occurs. Indirect capital expenditures jobs are temporary, full-time 
jobs created in all the sectors that provide inputs, supply services, and otherwise support 
construction and manufacturing resulting from capital investment in the directly affected 
sectors. These jobs are attributed fully to the year in which the capital investment occurs.

A comparison of job figures in this report to those outlined in other literature analyzing the 
effects of the net-zero transition would initially suggest that losses and gains described 
herein tend to be higher than other estimates.331 This is driven by a series of differentiating 
factors specific to this analysis: 1) Compared to a range of other comparable publications, 
analysis in this report captures a more comprehensive view across 12 major sectors, whereas 
many reports focus either specifically on a single sector (for example, power) or a series of 
related sectors (for example, fossil fuels production and utilization, hydrogen, renewables); 2) 
analysis in this report captures direct and indirect (upstream), O&M and capital expenditure 
jobs, whereas other comparable reports focus primarily on direct jobs within the sector; 3) 
we consider job losses and gains, including shifts across granular subsectors to give a total 
number for reallocations (gross gains plus gross losses) as well as the net differences usually 
in focus. In addition, our numbers can differ from reports that count total jobs in relevant 
sectors under different scenarios. Our definition separates job shifts from the transition 
between today and 2050, including those associated with current policies and incremental 
policy and technology changes required to achieve net zero, from jobs linked to non-transition 
effects like income and population growth. Our transition numbers will thus tend to be lower 
than any total projections by sector for a future year but higher than any comparison between 
a 1.5 scenario and a counterfactual that only differs in the pace of transition-related policy and 
activity changes.

Greening with jobs, 2018.

McKinsey & CompanyCalculation approach
Job losses and gains analyzed in this report are focused on sectors within the energy and 
land-use systems most closely tied to achieving the net-zero transition and which are 
the focus of this research. We measure the jobs impact in the following existing sectors, 
which account for about 85 percent of total emissions: power, automobiles, steel, cement, 
agriculture, forestry, oil, gas, and coal extraction and production (OGC), and buildings. We 
also measure jobs in the following new sectors: CCS, hydrogen, minerals mining, and biofuels. 
We model some sectors at the subsector level (for example, in power, we model jobs by coal, 
gas, solar PV, wind, etc.; in steel, we model jobs by BOF, EAF, and DRI). For purposes of this 
analysis, we report job losses and gains at the aggregated global level but derive those global 
figures from a buildup of modeling sector-specific activity levels within the 12 regions in the 
NGFS REMIND-MAgPIE model. 

We calculate direct O&M jobs by multiplying the job intensity (that is, the number of jobs 
per unit of production or installed capacity) of each sector and subsector in a given year 
and region with the activity level of that subsector in that year and region (that is, units of 
production or installed capacity), derived either directly from the NGFS scenario data or from 
downscaling of NGFS scenarios done in collaboration with Vivid Economics, as noted earlier.

We derive job intensity by applying annual productivity growth assumptions to baseline 
(2020) job intensity by region for each sector and subsector. These productivity growth 
assumptions are based on forward-looking productivity growth estimates where available, 
and historical productivity growth where forward-looking estimates are not available.

Indirect O&M jobs are calculated in each period by multiplying the direct O&M jobs in that 
period by the corresponding indirect jobs multiplier (that is, the number of indirect jobs per 
direct job) for the respective sector and region. Our indirect jobs multipliers are derived using 
regional input-output tables constructed from underlying OECD country tables. We then 
adjusted up these indirect jobs within the region to account for inputs provided through inter-
regional trade, resulting in the total indirect jobs associated with direct jobs within the region. 

Because the direct jobs of each sector we model are in some cases upstream jobs in another 
modeled sector (for example, an oil and gas job is an upstream job for the fossil-based power 
sector), we take a final step of netting out any double counting. To do so, we exclude a set 
of sectors for which we have done bottom-up calculations elsewhere, including agriculture, 
forestry and fishing; mining and extraction of energy; coke and refined petroleum, other 
nonmetallic mineral products, manufacture of basic metals, motor vehicles, trailers and 
semi-trailers; power; machinery, and equipment and construction. If all upstream sectors are 
considered, the indirect jobs shifts would be about 15 to 25 percent higher without netting out 
the job changes from other sectors already modeled.

We calculate direct capital expenditures jobs by multiplying capital expenditures investment 
numbers for each sector and subsector by region by year (described above in the investments 
section) with a combination of two sets of jobs multipliers (that is, number of jobs per million 
dollars) for the respective year and region: construction and machinery and equipment n. e. c. 
(referred to in this report as “manufacturing” unless otherwise specified). These multipliers 
by region and year are derived from the same input-output tables and multipliers as the 
indirect jobs multipliers described above, which we also use in calculating indirect capital 
expenditures jobs.

We assume capital expenditures investment to be split equally between construction 
and manufacturing for all sectors, except buildings, where we estimate the split as 20/80 
between construction (that is, installation) and manufacturing.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring3. Analysis of exposure of sectors across the economy

We measure sector exposure to the climate transition in terms of the life cycle emissions 
intensity of sectors. Life cycle emissions include sectors’ emissions in their own operations 
(scope 1 emissions), in their supply chains (scope 2 and scope 3 [inputs] emissions), and in the 
use of their products (scope 3 [products] emissions).332 We normalize sectors’ emissions by 
their gross output to estimate emissions’ intensity; normalizing by gross output allows us to 
assess the sectors’ emissions relative to the magnitude of their activities. We thus measure 
emissions intensity in terms of kilotons of emissions per million dollars of gross output.

We consider all CO₂, CH4, and N₂O emissions produced and consumed by economic sectors 
in our analysis. We use the GWP100 methodology to convert all gases to CO₂ equivalent. 
We define sectors based on the ISIC Rev. 4 sector classifications, and analyze sectors 
at the same level of granularity as available in the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). 
We use WIOD data for gross output by sector and to analyze the flow of goods and services 
between sectors. 

We calculate emissions intensity by sector as follows:

Scope 1: We map each category of emissions (for example, power) to the sector that is the 
site of those emissions or whose operations result in those emissions (for example, electricity, 
gas, and utilities). For most categories of emissions, there is a clear one-to-one mapping 
to a sector whose operations result in those emissions, with the exceptions of commercial 
buildings heating, and road transport. This is because all sectors operate commercial 
buildings and vehicles that result in these emissions. We distribute these categories of 
emissions between all sectors proportionally, based on their stocks of total construction 
assets and total transportation equipment, respectively. We use these two measures as 
proxies for the levels of heating and driving needs of each sector. We then divide the total 
scope 1 emissions allocated to each sector by that sector’s gross output to get to the scope 1 
emissions intensity. We arrive at the gross outputs for each sector from an aggregated, global 
input-output table from WIOD.

Scope 2: We use the aggregated, global input-output table from WIOD to get the value of 
input that each sector buys from the electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply sector. 
We multiply these values with the scope 1 emissions intensity of the electricity, gas, steam, 
and air conditioning supply sector (calculated in the prior step) to arrive at the total scope 2 
emissions of each sector. We then divide the total scope 2 emissions of each sector by that 
sector’s gross output to arrive at the scope 2 emissions intensity.

Scope 3 (inputs): We use the aggregated, global input-output table from WIOD to get the 
value of inputs that each sector buys from all the other sectors, except the electricity, gas, 
steam, and air conditioning supply sector (since that was covered under the previous step). 
We then multiply these values with the respective scope 1 emissions intensities of the sectors 
from which the inputs are being bought to arrive at the total scope 3 (inputs) emissions. We 
then divide the total scope 3 (inputs) emissions of each sector by that sector’s gross output to 
get to the scope 3 (inputs) emissions intensity.

Scope 3 (products): We define scope 3 (products) emissions as emissions from the products 
of a sector that are reliant on fossil fuels to operate (for example, internal combustion engine 
cars, gas boilers, and blast oxygen furnaces). We map each category of emissions (for 
example, aviation) to the sector whose fossil fuel–reliant products create those emissions 
(for example, manufacture of other transport equipment, manufacturing of coke and 
refined petroleum products, and mining and extraction of energy-producing products). 
Here, each category of emissions can be mapped to more than one sector—that is, counted 

332 For purposes of this research “scope 1” emissions are direct greenhouse emissions that occur from sources that are 
controlled or owned by an organization; “scope 2” emissions are associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, 
heat, or cooling. “Scope 3” emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting 
organization but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain; thus scope 3 emissions result from emissions 
across an organization’s value chain that are not within the organization’s scope 1 and 2 boundary. See Greenhouse gases 
at EPA, United States Environmental Protection Agency. Similar definitions can also be applied when considering the 
scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions for a sector.

194

McKinsey & Companymore than once—as the products of multiple sectors may be creating those emissions. For 
example, in the case of road transportation emissions, we would map these emissions once 
to the manufacture of motor vehicles sector, which produces the ICE cars that need oil to 
operate, once to the manufacturing of coke and refined petroleum products sector, which 
produces the refined crude oil used in ICE cars, and once to the mining and extraction of 
energy- producing products sector, which produces the unrefined crude oil. Some categories 
of emissions, such as waste, are not mapped to any sector because they are not caused by 
the products of any sector. We then divide the total scope 3 (products) emissions allocated to 
each sector by that sector’s gross output to get to the scope 3 (products) emissions intensity.

Life cycle emissions intensity: We sum the scope 1, 2, 3 (inputs), and 3 (products) emissions 
intensities of each sector to get to the life cycle emissions intensity of that sector.

We use this analysis to classify sectors into archetypes. To do this, we first look at a sector’s 
scope 3 (products) emissions intensity. If it is relatively high, we classify the sector into 
producers of fossil fuel energy or producers of fossil fuel–dependent products, based on 
whether they produce fossil fuel themselves or not. We look at this scope of emissions first 
because we believe that this represents the most material exposure to a sector. Together, 
these categories represent sectors with high emissions in their core products.

Then we look at a sector’s scope 1 emissions intensity. If it is relatively high, we classify the 
sector into emitters in core operations. We look at this scope of emissions next because we 
believe that this represents the next most material exposure to a sector, since the sector 
would have to fundamentally change its own operations under a net-zero transition.

Next, we look at a sector’s combined scope 2 and scope 3 (inputs) emissions intensities (as 
these are both driven by inputs). If they are relatively high, we classify the sector into users of 
inputs from emitters.

If none of the above is true (that is, if all scope of emissions intensities are low), we classify the 
sector in relatively low exposure.

4. Analysis of countries’ exposure and opportunities 

To analyze how countries and regions would be affected by a net-zero transition, we have 
conducted four broad sets of analyses.

First, we examine the overall spending on physical assets for energy and land-use systems 
that will be needed in different regions; we do this using activity levels for different sectors 
and regions from the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario and unit capital costs for different 
technologies. This is a similar approach to that described previously for capital spending.

Second, we examine the exposure of the economies of different countries to transition shifts 
more broadly. We focus on 69 countries that make up about 95 percent of global GDP and 
about 80 percent of global emissions. Countries were selected based on data availability 
across all the indicators in our analysis, as well as to ensure broad geographic coverage. 
To measure the exposure in each area of the economy, we considered the share of a country’s 
GDP, capital stock, and jobs in sectors most exposed to the transition. We chose these areas 
because they collectively represent production activity and stocks of human and physical 
capital. To identify the sectors most exposed, we considered the archetypes described 
previously that represent the most exposed sectors; namely those with high emissions 
intensity in their own operations; those whose products, in turn, emit while being used; and 
those that have high emissions embedded in their supply chains. Each economy’s transition-
exposure score is the average of the shares of GDP, capital stock, and jobs in these sectors. 
Thus, a zero score would indicate that none of the country’s GDP, capital stock, or jobs are in 
these sectors, while 100 would indicate that all of the country’s GDP, capital stock, and jobs 
are in these sectors. 

195

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringSeparately, we also look at consumer activity in the form of per capita household emissions 
(from driving, heating, and cooking) to assess the materiality of exposure for the consumers 
and the extent to which they may need to shift practices as a result of the transition. For 
our consumer metric, we look at the amount of emissions for which consumers are directly 
responsible by examining the consumer shares of road and buildings emissions. 

This analysis accounts for the possibility that countries that directly emit the most carbon may 
not necessarily have the highest levels of exposure. Exposure to the transition could result 
from either direct scope 1 emissions (such as those resulting from domestic energy use) or 
from indirect emissions upstream and downstream in value chains. For example, a country 
with a large but relatively low-emissions automotive value chain could nevertheless be 
exposed to the transition. 

Country exposure varies with the share of jobs, output, or capital stock in sectors exposed 
to the transition. Assessing the exposed share of jobs or capital or output, rather than the 
absolute quantity of the exposed jobs or capital or output, provides a way of gauging the 
materiality of the transition for each country. 

For this country-level analysis, we chose to measure economic exposure (share exposed) 
rather than quantify actual socioeconomic outcomes (realized gain or loss, for example in 
jobs, GDP, or value of physical capital stock) because such outcomes are not predetermined. 
They could be mitigated by the scale and nature of actions taken to manage the transition. 
Measuring the exposure therefore allows decision makers to understand where to focus 
attention and effort on managing the transition.

It is important to note that countries’ current efforts (for example, spending to transform 
power assets or to diversify economies toward hydrogen) could reduce their exposure going 
forward. However, this analysis focuses on exposure today in order to create a fact base for 
countries to inform their decision making. Similarly, countries with high exposure today may 
eventually benefit from the transition—for instance, by establishing economical sources of 
low-emissions power or building future assets in a way that reduces their future exposure. 
We describe these as we consider opportunities below, but do not quantify the impact on 
countries’ economies and how this might reduce overall exposure.

Other aspects of a country’s activities could be exposed, but we have not included those here. 
For example, we have not included tax revenue and exports, given their strong relationship 
to GDP. 

Third, we have evaluated each country’s current position with respect to the opportunities 
that could arise in the Net Zero 2050 scenario. We primarily assess endowments of natural 
capital and the availability of technological and human capital as the basis for the comparative 
advantages that countries possess or could build over time.

The presence of natural capital indicates a country’s potential to develop sectors such as 
hydrogen production and minerals mining that would emerge during the transition, while 
technological and human capital indicate a country’s capability to undertake innovations to 
enable the transitions.

Natural capital
Solar potential: We measure a country’s solar potential based on its GHI (solar irradiance in 
kWh / m2 / day); that is, power received from the sun per unit area. This provides an indication 
of the density of solar resource in a country and its ability to capture that potential. Data are 
sourced from the World Bank database of global photovoltaic power potential by country, 
April 2020. 

196

McKinsey & CompanyWind potential: We measure a country’s wind potential based on its mean wind power density 
in the 10 percent most windy areas at 100m height (W/m2). This provides an indication of the 
density of wind resource in a country and its ability to capture that potential. Data is sourced 
from the Global Wind Atlas 3.0, a web-based application developed, owned, and operated by 
the Technical University of Denmark. The Global Wind Atlas 3.0 is released in partnership with 
the World Bank Group, utilizing data provided by Vortex, using funding provided by the Energy 
Sector Management Assistance Program. This is calculated by downscaling large-scale 
forecasting data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. 

Reforestation potential: Countries’ reforestation potential was calculated by assessing the 
extent of land that is technically suitable for reforestation, then narrowing this area down 
to a realistic reforestation potential using biophysical filters. The resulting area is then 
converted into carbon sequestration potential. Three specific filters were used. First, a biome 
filter, to exclude biomes where reforestation is nonnatural or could have negative effects on 
ecosystems and climate, for instance boreal forests/taiga; grasslands, tropical savannas, and 
shrublands; and deserts and xeric shrublands biomes. Second, a water stress filter, to exclude 
areas where water stress is projected to be extremely high (greater than 80 percent) or the 
area is forecast to be arid in 2040, based on the RCP 8.5 scenario. Third, a human footprint 
filter to exclude current cropland and urban areas, as well as areas where urban expansion 
is projected with a probability greater than 50 percent by 2050. Spatially explicit carbon-
sequestration rates were then applied to each area with reforestation potential to estimate 
the total abatement potential.333 Data is sourced from McKinsey Nature Analytics.

Minerals availability: The ratio of proven reserves to global production for each mineral is 
calculated as the total proven reserves of the mineral divided by the total current annual 
global production for each of six categories of minerals (cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, zinc, 
rare earths). This was done in order to account for the varying values of the absolute levels 
of different minerals (that is, one ton of copper is not the same as one ton of cobalt). We 
therefore normalize the reserves available of each mineral with their respective current annual 
production (acknowledging that usage may increase during and after the net-zero transition, 
as well as the fact that reserves include only currently discovered deposits). Data is sourced 
from Mineral commodity summaries 2020, US Geological Survey, January 2020. 

Carbon-sequestration capacity: Data are sourced from Christopher Consoli, CCS storage 
indicator (CCS-SI), Global CCS Institute, 2018. The CCS-SI uses a defined methodology 
to undertake critical analysis of a nation’s storage resource development and record the 
progress in national and global storage development. The metric is calculated based on three 
factors: natural geological storage potential, maturity and confidence of storage resource 
assessments, and experience in CO₂ storage project development to date. The result is 
a score out of 100, with higher scores indicating a greater state of readiness of storage 
resources to support wide-scale deployment of CCS.

September 2020, issue 585.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bringTechnological and human capital
R&D: We measure a country’s R&D capabilities based on its R&D spending as a share of its 
GDP. This provides an indication of the overall innovative capabilities of a country. Data is 
sourced from the World Bank’s database on research and development expenditure as a 
percentage of GDP. 

Climate-specific patents: We measure a country’s climate-specific capabilities based on 
the number of its climate change mitigation–related patents. This provides an indication of 
the climate change mitigation–specific innovative capabilities of a country. Data is sourced 
from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics on patents in 
environment-related technologies.

Relevant skill availability: We measure the availability of skills relevant for the climate 
transition in a country based on its share of STEM graduates. This provides an indication 
of the innovative capabilities of the workforce of a country. Data are sourced from the 
International Labour Organization ILOSTAT database. While we focused on STEM skills for 
our analysis in this report, we acknowledge that many other skills will also be needed in a net-
zero transition.

Fourth and finally, we consider the physical risk exposures of different countries, drawing on 
our past research on the topic. For further details, see Climate risk and response: Physical 
hazards and socioeconomic impacts, McKinsey Global Institute, January 2020.

Climate math: What a 1.5-degree pathway 

Climate math: What  

a 1.5-degree pathway  

would take 

Decarbonizing global business at scale is achievable, 

but the math is daunting.

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, everyone is rightly focused on protecting lives and 

livelihoods. Can we simultaneously strive to avoid the next crisis? The answer is yes—if 

we make greater environmental resilience core to our planning for the recovery ahead, 

by focusing on the economic and employment opportunities associated with investing in 

both climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future. 

Adapting to climate change is critical because, as a recent McKinsey Global Institute 

report shows, with further warming unavoidable over the next decade, the risk of 

physical hazards and nonlinear, socioeconomic jolts is rising.1 Mitigating climate 

change through decarbonization represents the other half of the challenge. 

Scientists estimate that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would reduce the odds 

of initiating the most dangerous and irreversible effects of climate change. 

While a number of analytic perspectives explain how greenhouse-gas (GHG) 

emissions would need to evolve to achieve a 1.5-degree pathway, few paint a clear 

and comprehensive picture of the actions global business could take to get there. 

And little wonder: the range of variables and their complex interaction make any 

modeling difficult. As part of an ongoing research effort, we sought to cut through 

the complexity by examining, analytically, the degree of change that would be 

required in each sector of the global economy to reach a 1.5-degree pathway. What 

technically feasible carbon-mitigation opportunities—in what combinations and to what 

degree—could potentially get us there?

would take (April 2020) 

A 1.5-degree pathway is technically achievable, 

but the math is daunting. Such a pathway would 

require dramatic emissions reductions over the 

next ten years. We clarify a series of prominent 

shifts that would need to take place for the world 

to move rapidly on to a 1.5-degree pathway. 

The shifts encompass food and forestry, large-scale 

electrification, industrial adaptation, clean-power 

generation, and carbon management and markets.

Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and 

socioeconomic impacts (January 2020)

This report focuses on understanding the nature and 

extent of physical risk from a changing climate over 

the next three decades, exploring physical risk as it 

is the basis of both transition and liability risks. We 

estimate inherent physical risk, absent adaptation 

and mitigation, to assess the magnitude of the 

challenge and highlight the case for action.

55 percent by 2030 while delivering broad economic 

benefits.

modeling difficult. As part of an ongoing research effort, we sought to cut through 
the complexity by examining, analytically, the degree of change that would be 
required in each sector of the global economy to reach a 1.5-degree pathway. What 
technically feasible carbon-mitigation opportunities—in what combinations and to what 
degree—could potentially get us there?

Climate math: What a 1.5-degree pathway 
would take (April 2020) 

A 1.5-degree pathway is technically achievable, 
but the math is daunting. Such a pathway would 
require dramatic emissions reductions over the 
next ten years. We clarify a series of prominent 
shifts that would need to take place for the world 
to move rapidly on to a 1.5-degree pathway. 
The shifts encompass food and forestry, large-scale 
electrification, industrial adaptation, clean-power 
generation, and carbon management and markets.

Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and 
socioeconomic impacts (January 2020)

This report focuses on understanding the nature and 
extent of physical risk from a changing climate over 
the next three decades, exploring physical risk as it 
is the basis of both transition and liability risks. We 
estimate inherent physical risk, absent adaptation 
and mitigation, to assess the magnitude of the 
challenge and highlight the case for action.

Net-Zero Europe: Decarbonization pathways and 
socioeconomic implications (December 2020) 

The decarbonization pathways to a net-zero Europe 
are countless, but not all are cost optimal. We explore 
one pathway that could reduce the EU’s emissions by 
55 percent by 2030 while delivering broad economic 
benefits.

Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a 
time of automation (December 2017)

Research for this report finds that as many as 
375 million workers around the world may need 
to find jobs in new occupations, requiring the 
acquisition of new skills.
