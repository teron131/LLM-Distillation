Around the world, 1.3 billion people, or 16 percent of 
the population, are living with significant disabilities, 
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).1 By 
and large, these individuals experience more barriers 
to accessing healthcare than the general population 

(see sidebar “Defining ‘disability’ and effects on care 
access and outcomes”). As a result, the United Nations’ 
goal of “ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being 
for all at all ages” will be very difficult to achieve.2 

Defining ‘disability’ and effects on care access and outcomes 

There are many types and categorizations of disabilities. According to the World Health Organization, disabilities 
result from the interactions between individuals with an impairment and personal and environmental factors, 
including negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social support.1 
Impairments can be physical, mental or psychosocial, intellectual, and sensory. 

Additionally, people with disabilities often have greater care needs, in part because they develop health 
conditions due to their impairments or underlying health (for example, immobility caused by a stroke could result 
in bedsores). They also are more likely to belong to cohorts with greater healthcare needs. For example, people 
with disabilities are older, on average, than the general population2; therefore, they are more likely to have chronic 
diseases or other conditions that necessitate more care. The prevalence of disabilities is also higher in women, 
who face greater barriers accessing health services in some settings,3 and the poor, who experience overall 
worse health as a result.4 

On average, people with disabilities have substantially worse health outcomes, with a mortality rate twice as high 
as the general population’s and a life expectancy that is ten to 20 years shorter.5 This is due in part to disparities 
across the whole patient journey (for example, the ability to access and pay for services). In a survey conducted 
in five countries (Brazil, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), people with a disability 
also reported greater distrust of the healthcare system than the general population (73 percent compared with 
56 percent). Among ethnic minorities and people of color who are also disabled, the disparity is even higher 
(82 percent compared with 52 percent who are neither).6

THE MISSING BILLION: LACK OF DISABILITY DATA IMPEDES HEALTHCARE EQUITY 

People with disabilities have a right to add years to 
their lives and life to their years through better health.3 
Closing health outcome gaps between populations 
with and without disabilities—in all dimensions of health 
(physical, social, mental, and spiritual)—calls, first and 
foremost, for good data. However, there are sizable and 
persistent gaps in health data with respect to people 
with disabilities.4 In a 2023 review of data sets across 188 
countries, 63 had no data sets with functional-difficulty 
questions5 between 2009 and 2022.6 As described in the 
McKinsey Health Institute’s (MHI) six shifts to reach the 
full potential of human health,7 better data is needed to do 
the following: 

+  raise awareness of the scale and nature of disparities 
in health outcomes; measurement is foundational to 
improvement 

+  determine, and build awareness of, the benefits of 

improving health equity and outcomes for people with 
disabilities8 

+  identify and quantify the healthcare access barriers 

experienced by people with disabilities 

+  determine ways to close the health outcome gap by 

using data to inform and scale “what works” given that 
interventions often do not translate into action9 

+  establish a baseline with standardized 

measurements, set targets, and monitor the progress 
of interventions 

MHI is working with the Missing Billion Initiative to address 
health system challenges and close this gap in health 
data and equity (see sidebar “About the Missing Billion 
Initiative and the McKinsey Health Institute”).10 In this first 
report, we explore how a lack of health data exacerbates 
the challenges of meeting the needs of people with 
disabilities. We also share analysis of the maturity levels 
of different countries with respect to data collection and 
usage, and we outline actions stakeholders could take to 
close the health data equity gap. 

About the Missing Billion Initiative 
and the McKinsey Health Institute 

The Missing Billion is a global initiative committed 
to improving access to health for the 1.3 billion 
people around the world who have disabilities. The 
McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) is a non-profit-
generating entity of McKinsey and includes health 
equity as a focus area. 

The Missing Billion and MHI are working in 
partnership to accelerate the movement on 
inclusive health and develop use cases across 
countries. A foundational part of this effort is jointly 
publishing novel insights to demonstrate the health 
data, access, and outcome gaps for people with 
disabilities globally. 

People with 
disabilities have a 
right to add years to 
their lives and life to 
their years through 
better health.

THE MISSING BILLION: LACK OF DISABILITY DATA IMPEDES HEALTHCARE EQUITY 

Barriers to healthcare access 

People with disabilities often experience more difficulty 
accessing healthcare than the population at large, from 
perceiving a need to receiving treatment and follow-up 
care (Exhibit 1).11 

This health equity gap persists in part because some 
healthcare professionals feel they lack the training and 
confidence to communicate with and serve people with 
disabilities. In a 2019–20 survey of 714 practicing US 
physicians, only about two in five said they were very 
confident in their ability to provide equal-quality care to 
patients with disabilities, and only three in five strongly 
agreed that they welcome disabled patients into their 
practices.12 

Perceived negative attitudes from healthcare workers 
can have tangible adverse effects on the experience of 
patients with disabilities. For example, the care team 
for a visually impaired woman with HIV in South Africa 
assumed she didn’t have sex or need family planning.13 A 
man with a hearing impairment in Kenya sat in the waiting 
room until the office closed because he missed audio 
notifications that it was his turn to see the doctor.14 

As a cohort, people with disabilities are sometimes seen 
as “less deserving” of care during a crisis. For example, 
in some US states, ventilator allocation protocols during 
the pandemic appeared to endorse the removal of these 

life-saving devices from “people using them for a chronic 
condition.”15  In the United Kingdom, some COVID-19 
patients with learning disabilities (equivalent to intellectual 
disabilities in other countries) were automatically given 
“do not resuscitate” notices without consultation or 
consent.16 

Finally, disabilities are more prevalent among certain 
groups that may be marginalized in other ways, further 
exacerbating barriers to accessing healthcare. The 
following are some examples: 

+  Twenty-four percent of people with disabilities live 
below the national poverty line, compared with 
13 percent of those without disabilities.17 This is 
a cyclical relationship. For example, McKinsey 
research shows less than one-fifth of Americans 
with a disability are employed, compared with nearly 
two-thirds of those without a disability. And poverty 
is linked to higher risk of trauma, injury, and disease 
(Exhibit 2).18 

+  Nineteen percent of women globally have a disability, 

compared with 12 percent of men.19 

+  Globally, nearly half of people aged 60 or older have a 

disability.20 

+  Refugees in displacement crises are twice as likely as 

local populations to have a disability.21 

Perceived negative attitudes from healthcare 
workers can have tangible adverse effects on 
the experience of patients with disabilities.

EXHIBIT 1 

People with disabilities experience barriers to healthcare services at 
every stage of the patient journey. 

I perceive a need, but I’m 
uncertain about symptoms and 
whether to seek care 

“I was used to having frequent headaches due 
to having low vision and was so conditioned 
to the pain that I did not realize when to seek 
help. We only got to know about the tumor 
when it was at a later stage.” 

Adolescent with low vision 

I reach the healthcare facility, but I’m unable 
to get accessible or affordable transport 

“I kept checking the vaccination portal for slot 
availability in the nearby hospital, but it constantly 
showed full. There was no provision for people with 
disabilities, and it was too difficult and expensive for 
us to take her far away.” 

Father of a girl with physical impairment 

I decide to seek healthcare, but I’m 
concerned about the quality and 
accessibility of care I will receive 

“When I go to a healthcare service for the 
first time, I worry they won’t understand 
me, think I have a mental disability, and 
put me into a psychiatric hospital.” 

Older person with cerebral palsy and 
speech impairment 

I engage with healthcare staff, but I’m not treated 
comprehensively or with respect by staff, or I have 
communication issues with staff 

“The doctor couldn’t understand that I was 
pregnant. I was given pain medication for 
stomachache and sent home.” 

Woman with hearing impairment 

I access healthcare services, but I’m 
unable to access the health facility 

“I have kidney stones, so I need to keep 
using the washroom. But the toilet in 
the hospital was so inaccessible that I 
couldn’t go there at all.” 

Woman with physical impairment 

I receive treatment and 
follow-up care, but I’m confused 
about what to do after the visit 

“I need assistance with my medication. 
Usually, the healthcare workers write the 
instructions on the package—for example, 
1×3, 2×4, and so on—but I cannot read that.”

Limitations and challenges in 
disability and health data 

Globally, national health systems are awash in data 
from healthcare clinicians, pharmacies, insurers, 
national health questionnaires, and more. This data 
includes personal health data—for example, from 
claims, registries, electronic health records (EHRs), 
and testing. It also includes system-level health data 

(such as prescription volumes and clinical volumes) and 
population-level statistics (for instance, immunization 
coverage, mortality, and burden of disease). Much of this 
data can be disaggregated by age, gender, and ethnicity. 
This data is important because it provides insights on 
subsets of the population but it also gives rise to security 
concerns as data must be prevented from being used for 
discriminatory purposes.

THE MISSING BILLION: LACK OF DISABILITY DATA IMPEDES HEALTHCARE EQUITY 

In addition, our current understanding of the health of 
people with disabilities is inconsistent and limited by huge 
gaps in comparison data.22 Four factors contribute to this 
health data inequity: 

Inconsistent definitions and collection methods 
There are many ways to measure disability—including 
self-reporting, clinical diagnosis, impairment 
assessment, and disability registration—but there is no 
standard, global definition of disability. Moreover, some 
conditions are difficult to measure objectively and may 
fluctuate over time. Making meaningful comparisons 
of disabled populations across countries is difficult 
because thresholds and criteria vary (see sidebar 
“Varying determinations of disability”). Increased use 
of questions from the Washington Group on Disability 
Statistics to measure disability is addressing this issue,23 
but variations in the application of this tool still lead to 
problems with comparability. 

Data sets built using different data definitions, data 
formats, collection tools, and administration methods 
may yield quite different results. For example, the 
Ugandan Bureau of Statistics administered two surveys 
to assess the prevalence of people with disabilities—the 
Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) in 2016 
and the Functional Disability Survey (FDS) in 2017.24 Both 
research groups used the same data collection tool,25 but 
the UDHS identified an overall prevalence of disability of 
8.4 percent of adults,26 compared with 16.5 percent in 
the FDS.27 This variation in results arose from differences 
in survey design, interviewer training processes, and 
targeted respondents (head of household and disabled 
household member), among other factors. 

Lack of consistency in data methods also leads to poor 
data interoperability, which makes it difficult or impossible 
to conduct apples-to-apples comparisons across data 
sets, aggregate data to identify patterns and trends, and 
otherwise glean meaningful insights (for example, at the 
local and national levels). 

Varying determinations of disability 

A look at Vietnam and Germany illustrates the 
differences in how disability is determined. 

Vietnam. Individuals are assessed for disability 
allowance by a physician based on their ability to 
perform eight essential activities of daily living. For 
each activity, they are assigned a score; the sum 
of those scores equates to their “disability degree,” 
which is used to determine eligibility for benefits. 

However, this method has faced criticism for 
its limitations in identifying individuals with 
psychosocial and developmental impairments. 
Additionally, it may underestimate the significant 
impact of certain conditions, such as deafness, on 
the ability to complete functional activities.1 

Germany. Individuals are considered to have a 
disability if physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory 
capacities deviate for more than six months from 
a state that is typical for their age, resulting in 
prevention from equal participation in society. The 
degree of disability is determined by a physician on 
a scale from 20 to 100 in increments of ten. Anyone 
with a score above 50 is considered severely 
disabled.2

THE MISSING BILLION: LACK OF DISABILITY DATA IMPEDES HEALTHCARE EQUITY 

Missing data 
Many countries collect no data on disabilities. For 
example, according to a 2021 report by the Disability 
Data Initiative, one in four countries included no questions 
about disabilities in national censuses and household 
surveys from 2009 through 2018.28 And the initiative’s 
2023 report found that about four in five countries did not 
include questions about functional difficulty in national 
censuses and household surveys from 2009 through 
2022.29 

Additionally, most disability data sets are collected 
on a one-off basis (making it impossible to conduct 
comparisons over time), do not cover many types of 
disability (for example, communication impairments), and 
focus narrowly on disabilities caused by disease. The lack 
of disability data collected within routine EHRs results in 
another major missed opportunity to disaggregate these 
rich data sources by disability. 

In the meantime, governments and other stakeholders 
benefit from nationwide disability data sets, 
disaggregated by impairment type, that determine 
healthcare access and needs and inform national 
healthcare plans. Moreover, healthcare professionals, 
policy makers, and other stakeholders lack access 
to large-scale, comprehensive, consistent, disability-
specific data sets that could present a fuller picture 
(across social, economic, public health, clinical, and 
life-stage lenses) of the lived experiences of those with 
disabilities. 

An additional challenge in collecting and analyzing 
health data is that data collectors must have core 
competencies in data privacy and security.30 A 2019 
study found that consumer trust in privacy and data 
collection was low overall, but consumers expressed 
the most trust in healthcare and financial services.31 
This likely reflects individuals’ high expectations for 
the privacy of their sensitive healthcare information, 

especially in communities where disability is stigmatized. 
It is vital to maintain this trust. Finally, for a population 
that is so often excluded from data collection, it is crucial 
to take additional measures to ensure data collection 
methods are accessible to avoid creating (and drawing 
conclusions from) biased data sets. Taken together, these 
factors mean that a focus on solutions cannot be at the 
expense of privacy or assumed to be without bias. 

Data that cannot be disaggregated 
Disability health data often does not allow disaggregation 
by impairment type, despite the fact that people 
with different impairments may experience different 
challenges when accessing healthcare. Simply asking, 
“Do you have a disability (yes or no)?” does not allow 
disaggregation. Moreover, the data cannot be used in 
international research because different countries have 
varying definitions of disability, and stigma may affect the 
data’s reliability.32 

In addition, impairment-specific studies are not evenly 
distributed. Systematic reviews of studies have shown 
that comparatively more data has been collected and 
analyzed for certain impairment types.33 For example, 30 
percent of studies assessed the relationship between 
COVID-19 mortality and psychosocial impairments 
such as depression and anxiety, while just 12 percent 
examined the relationship between COVID-19 and 
physical impairments such as loss of a limb and spinal 
cord injuries. Globally, no publications have examined 
mortality risk from COVID-19 for people with hearing or 
vision impairments.34 

Likewise, a 2021 systematic review of studies comparing 
the uptake of breast or cervical cancer screenings for 
people with and without disabilities found that 47 percent 
of the studies examined psychiatric or mental health 
impairments, while just 6 percent of studies looked at 
functional hearing loss.35

THE MISSING BILLION: LACK OF DISABILITY DATA IMPEDES HEALTHCARE EQUITY 

Insufficient analytics, sharing, and use 
of data to inform policy actions 
Data collectors and other stakeholders frequently don’t 
analyze all the data available with respect to disability, 
thereby missing opportunities to improve health 
outcomes for people with disabilities. Furthermore, a lack 
of global guidelines and best practices on analyzing and 
sharing disability data leads to substantial variability in 
approaches and results, in contrast to domains of global 
health that have embraced platforms that promote data 
sharing. For example, the Gateway to Global Aging Data 
provides access to population survey data on aging 
around the world, and the Dementias Platform UK acts 
as a comprehensive data repository on individuals with 
dementia in the United Kingdom.36 

In addition, the small amount of existing research 
on the healthcare barriers faced by people with 
disabilities has not translated to effective policy 

design and implementation at a global level. Half 
of EU member states have no legislation requiring 
reasonable accommodation and prohibiting disability 
discrimination in healthcare.37 Country evaluations 
from the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (UNCRPD) make it clear that current efforts 
are inadequate to achieve equity in healthcare access 
for people with disabilities and that countries have not 
fulfilled their obligations.38 

Ultimately, the absence of data to inform policy actions 
can have serious and sometimes fatal implications. 
For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some 
countries failed to review evidence linking certain 
impairments with severe COVID-19 outcomes. As a 
result, some people at elevated risk were not identified as 
such (for example, to be prioritized for vaccines), which 
may have resulted in unnecessary deaths.39

Practices to improve data 
collection and usage 

Countries can adopt good practices in data collection 
and usage to create a more complete picture of the 
health needs and gaps of people with disabilities and use 
the data to conduct analysis to inform policy and program 
decisions. 

Good practices in data collection 
Several practices have proved to bolster the quality of 
data collection and usage40: 

Include a disability marker in EHRs. Ideally, countries 
would collect disability data from EHRs covering a high 
percentage of the population and include identifiers of 
people with disabilities. This would allow policy makers 
and researchers to compare people with disabilities 
with the entire population in terms of healthcare needs, 
access, and outcomes. Among other advantages, 
analyses could be disaggregated to identify intersectional 
factors (such as poverty, age, sex, and impairment type) 
affecting people with disabilities. Although the exact 
determination of disability varies by country, the ability 
to compare detailed health information of people with 
and without various impairments in a given country 
can unlock rich insights. At present, however, most 
EHRs do not include a standardized disability marker, 
and creating one from medical records is challenging 
because diagnoses are recorded inconsistently and it is 
difficult to map an impairment (such as visual impairment) 
to a medical diagnosis (for example, glaucoma). Artificial 
intelligence could offer a solution to this problem by 
standardizing the way impairments are tagged and 
creating cohesive data sets that can be disaggregated by 
impairment type. 

Create disability registries.41 Registries are voluntary 
lists of persons with disabilities that can be connected 
to health data, allowing comparisons with the general 
population. Registries can be difficult to maintain, so 
they work best for this purpose if a high percentage 
of people with disabilities are motivated to register (for 
example, to qualify for benefits), which helps maintain 
the representativeness of the data set. Unfortunately, 
registries are often limited in scope and scale. They may 
not be integrated across all health data, so they may lack 
details and can become out of date. In addition, they 

often reflect inconsistent definitions of disabilities across 
and within countries, and they represent subsets of 
people with disabilities—for example, those with learning 
disabilities or receiving employment benefits (see sidebar 
“The benefits of granular data”). 

The benefits of granular data 

In England, people with learning disabilities 
experience higher levels of unmet needs and have 
a shorter average life expectancy—18 years for 
women and 14 years for men—than the general 
population.1 In 2006–07, general practitioners are 
asked to keep a register of people with learning 
disabilities.2 

As of 2021, the voluntary registry included about 
250,000 patients who had been identified and 
diagnosed with learning disabilities by a general 
practitioner.3 NHS England calculates disability 
indicators at the subregional level and includes 
them in the registry data on key health issues 
such as screening, recorded disease prevalence, 
and prescription rates. As a result of the registry, 
people with learning disabilities may receive wider-
ranging health benefits. For example, the registry 
facilitates the identification of patients who are 
eligible for an annual learning-disability health 
check and seasonal flu vaccination. Moreover, 
analysis of registry data has resulted in changes to 
the health system, including the launch of STOMP, 
a project intended to stop the overprescription of 
psychotropic medicines to people with a learning 
disability, autism, or both.4 The registry in England 
highlights the potential benefits of collecting 
granular data on various impairment types.

sample sizes.

THE MISSING BILLION: LACK OF DISABILITY DATA IMPEDES HEALTHCARE EQUITY 

Data collectors and health systems need to recognize 
and address the risks associated with identifying 
individuals with disabilities in registries and EHRs— 
from both a digital identification and a data security 
perspective. 

Conduct surveys. Nationwide censuses and household 
surveys, which governments often rely on to produce 
large data sets that inform policy decisions, may include 
(at most) a subset of questions on disabilities. In many 
cases, these surveys are not conducted frequently 
enough to provide timely data, a shortcoming that 
became apparent during COVID-19 as governments 
scrambled for data to inform decision making. Surveys 
also commonly exclude people who are institutionalized 
or experiencing homelessness (groups in which disability 
prevalence is likely to be higher). Furthermore, these 
surveys are often (by design) completed by a single 
household representative, who may lack understanding 
of (or fail to acknowledge) the lived experiences of 
household members with disabilities. Survey methods 
often exclude people with disabilities (for example, those 
who have a communication impairment and need an 
interpreter), and may reflect reporting bias due to the 
stigma associated with disabilities. 

Surveys, including routine demographic surveys, can be 
a good starting point. They can capture a representative 
sample of the population and ask detailed questions 
about the particular and additional barriers facing people 
with disabilities, which are not revealed elsewhere. 
However, they require a significant budget, which could 
be a limiting factor, especially in low-income countries. 

Regardless of the data collection method they are using, 
stakeholders can adopt the following criteria for their 
data: 

+  current (less than ten years old) 

+  nationally representative (not just regional or local) 

+  inclusive of the full range of impairments 

+  linked to high-quality health data such as EHRs 

+  gathered using statistically valid methods: 

+  study design and sampling methods that are 

appropriate to the study question 

+  adequate sample sizes and response rates 

+  consistently defined and reliable measures of 

disability and impairment and health outcomes 

+  strong analysis, including presentation of 

confidence intervals 

Good practices in data usage 
Beyond data collection, stakeholders can also adopt 
good practices in data usage, including the following: 

Analyze existing data sets. Unexamined disability data 
sets are readily available to researchers. In May 2023, 
the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) identified 
2,565 data sets with indicators of health and disability, 
many of which have yet to be analyzed by governments, 
nongovernmental organizations, or others to examine the 
health outcomes of people with disabilities.42 

More work could also be done to link existing data sets 
to uncover new insights on the health gap experienced 
by people with disabilities. For example, the UK Office 
of National Statistics created the Public Health Data 
Asset—a data set comprising 2011 census records, 
death registrations, hospital episode statistics, and 
primary-care records43—that allowed researchers to 
examine COVID-19-related deaths by hearing and vision 
impairment status. Finally, national statistics offices could 
expand efforts to build disability data capabilities with 
expertise in good practices for analysis. 

Publish data. Entities that collect and report on data 
can prioritize publishing data sets in a timely manner (for 
example, within three years of collection) to improve the 
relevance of the analysis. 

Use data to direct policies and programs. National 
health agencies and systems can take a targeted 
approach to improving health equity for people with 
disabilities using published data. For example, a review 
of national strategic plans on HIV revealed that only a few 
countries acknowledge the need to include disability, and 
none have included disability comprehensively, despite 
the fact that HIV prevalence is twice as high for people 
with disabilities.44 National disability plans can also be 
used in tandem with national health plans to coordinate 
and guide government action, based on evidence from 
data.

National ministries of health can establish a disability-
focused capability—for example, a department or staff 
member responsible for reviewing disability data and 
policies. According to a study by WHO, 20 percent of 
countries in its Western Pacific region had no disability-
related capacity within their ministries of health.45 This 
capability is key to create a demand for disability health 

data and advance the agenda of inclusive health based 
on evidence. 

Over time, stakeholders can also explore opportunities 
to use artificial intelligence to close the data gap (see 
sidebar “Exploring how AI can help”).

Exploring how AI can help 

National statistics offices and other researchers have many opportunities to use AI to advance their data 
collection and analysis efforts while recognizing the risks and limitations of the technology. 

Data collection. Unstructured data abounds in healthcare. Researchers could collect this data from a variety 
of sources and convert it to structured data that could be used as inputs for traditional analysis using natural 
language processing.1 Alternatively, generative AI could be used to synthesize large volumes of unstructured 
data—for example, from clinical notes, medical literature, treatment details, and patient-reported experiences. 
This type of analysis could be performed on the data directly, where allowed, or on aggregated and anonymized 
data sets only, which would allow researchers to draw conclusions while protecting individuals’ anonymity. 

AI has the potential to affect the standardization of impairment tagging in health data sets. Today, health records 
frequently exhibit inconsistent tags for identical impairments, posing challenges in comprehending health access 
and outcomes for populations with such impairments. AI can help researchers create extensive and cohesive 
health data sets, facilitating more-effective analyses. 

Another valuable opportunity lies in gathering health data from personal and wearable digital devices such as 
high-tech watches and rings to create extensive disability and health data sets. To achieve this, individuals with 
disabilities would voluntarily identify themselves as such on their wearable devices and provide informed consent 
for their anonymized data to be aggregated. This approach could enable the establishment of meaningful 
connections between health symptoms and disabilities. 

Data analysis and use. Researchers could use machine learning to uncover relationships in large health data 
sets (for example, between a medical condition and an impairment type). Using AI data-linking techniques, they 
could integrate disparate data—electronic health records, imaging data, and social determinants of health, 
for example—to form a comprehensive view of disability and health. They could also continually enhance data 
quality using algorithms to identify and address errors, inconsistencies, and missing values, leading to cleaner 
and more-reliable data. Finally, countries could use advanced-analytics AI to assess which national programs 
and policies for populations with disabilities are most effective at improving health equity. 

Risks and limitations. Healthcare leaders must consider not only how to use these techniques but also the risks 
of doing so. For example, while AI can help reduce bias, it can also embed and scale bias.2 If an input data set 
underrepresents an impairment type, the needs of people with this impairment may go undetected because AI 
accuracy is limited by the quality of the inputs. Finally, healthcare data is particularly sensitive. All countries should 
create updated legal and regulatory considerations associated with data ethics to ensure that AI-based systems 
are including informed consent and privacy protection in their use of health data in algorithms.

Assessing maturity in data collection and data usage 
Countries have made varying degrees of progress in 
closing the disability data gap. To explore this variability, 
we developed an approach to assess data collection 
and data usage maturity based on the strength of 
the methods commonly adopted. We analyzed nine 
countries to assess their maturity against these scales 
and placed the countries along two axes: data collection 
and data usage (Exhibit 3) (see sidebar “Research scope 
and methodology”). 

Of the nine countries assessed, only Australia and 
Thailand have high data maturity (an index score of 3) 

across both axes. Australia has adopted all the criteria 
for high-quality data collection noted above. This was 
achieved by including unique identifiers by disability 
type in nationwide health information records through 
integration with national insurance data. As a result, 
the disability data set is automatically and continually 
updated. Australia also has adopted most of the best 
practices for high-quality data usage (current policies, 
transparent and valid analysis, many impairment domains 
included), although it has yet to fully translate insights into 
policy or regulatory actions with funding.

By comparison, health information records in Brazil are 
neither consistent (some are electronic, while others are 
still stored on paper) nor aggregated nationally. Brazil 
conducts a national health survey every five years (most 
recently in 2019), while best practice is every three years 
or less. It also uses household sampling as a proxy 
for national representation. And although it asks 50 
questions about functional difficulties and use of assistive 
devices, its methods are not internationally comparable. 
Brazil has relatively mature data usage practices but has 
not consistently translated analyzed and reported data 
into policy and program changes. 

Canada has low maturity because it relies on survey data 
and has published analysis of disability and health data 
in only a few provinces. Malawi has low maturity because 
it relies on survey data alone. Many countries worldwide, 
regardless of income level, are likely to be in this category. 

This analysis reveals that data scarcity is not limited to 
developing economies but is also prevalent in advanced 
economies. Therefore, the conventional categorization 
of developing versus developed nations provides 
only partial assistance in understanding the data 
landscape.

Research scope and methodology 

In May 2023, we conducted a data maturity index assessment of nine countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
France, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. Research was based on more than 20 
publications and websites from national statistics offices, nongovernmental organizations, ministries of health, 
and academic researchers. The countries were purposely selected to cover six continents, with a range of low- to 
high-income economies. 

The maturity scale was developed based on the strength of the main data collection methods in closing the 
disability health data gap and how well the data is used (Exhibits 1 and 2). Countries that collect disability surveys

A call to action 

Overcoming the disability health data gap will entail 
a coordinated and committed effort by relevant 
stakeholders (Exhibit 4). 

The gap in disability data presents a substantial barrier 
to achieving health equity. Without accurate and 
comprehensive data, all stakeholders are limited in 
their ability to address the needs and challenges faced 

by this large share of the global population. It is crucial 
for healthcare organizations, governments, donors, 
implementers, and other stakeholders to prioritize 
the collection and use of data as a fundamental step 
toward achieving equitable healthcare for all. By doing 
so, we can work toward a future in which individuals 
with disabilities receive the care and support they need, 
enabling them to lead healthier, more fulfilling lives. In 
an upcoming report, we will discuss opportunities for 
the public and private sectors to play a role in improving 
healthcare accessibility.
