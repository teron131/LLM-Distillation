The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Key insights

1.  Generative AI’s impact on 

productivity could add trillions 
of dollars in value to the global 
economy. Our latest research 
estimates that generative AI could 
add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion 
to $4.4 trillion annually across the 
63 use cases we analyzed—by 
comparison, the United Kingdom’s 
entire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion. 
This would increase the impact of 
all artificial intelligence by 15 to 
40 percent. This estimate would 
roughly double if we include the 
impact of embedding generative AI 
into software that is currently used 
for other tasks beyond those use 
cases.

2.  About 75 percent of the value that 
generative AI use cases could 
deliver falls across four areas: 
Customer operations, marketing 
and sales, software engineering, 
and R&D. Across 16 business 
functions, we examined 63 use 
cases in which the technology 
can address specific business 
challenges in ways that produce 
one or more measurable outcomes. 
Examples include generative AI’s 
ability to support interactions 
with customers, generate creative 
content for marketing and sales, 
and draft computer code based on 
natural-language prompts, among 
many other tasks. 

3.  Generative AI will have a significant 
impact across all industry sectors. 
Banking, high tech, and life 
sciences are among the industries 
that could see the biggest impact 
as a percentage of their revenues 
from generative AI. Across the 
banking industry, for example, the 
technology could deliver value 

equal to an additional $200 billion 
to $340 billion annually if the use 
cases were fully implemented. In 
retail and consumer packaged 
goods, the potential impact is also 
significant at $400 billion to $660 
billion a year.

4.  Generative AI has the potential 
to change the anatomy of work, 
augmenting the capabilities of 
individual workers by automating 
some of their individual activities. 
Current generative AI and other 
technologies have the potential to 
automate work activities that absorb 
60 to 70 percent of employees’ time 
today. In contrast, we previously 
estimated that technology has the 
potential to automate half of the 
time employees spend working.1 
The acceleration in the potential for 
technical automation is largely due 
to generative AI’s increased ability 
to understand natural language, 
which is required for work activities 
that account for 25 percent of total 
work time. Thus, generative AI has 
more impact on knowledge work 
associated with occupations that 
have higher wages and educational 
requirements than on other types 
of work.

5.  The pace of workforce 

transformation is likely to 
accelerate, given increases in the 
potential for technical automation. 
Our updated adoption scenarios, 
including technology development, 
economic feasibility, and diffusion 
timelines, lead to estimates that 
half of today’s work activities could 
be automated between 2030 and 
2060, with a midpoint in 2045, or 
roughly a decade earlier than in our 
previous estimates.

6.  Generative AI can substantially 

increase labor productivity across 
the economy, but that will require 
investments to support workers 
as they shift work activities or 
change jobs. Generative AI could 
enable labor productivity growth 
of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually 
through 2040, depending on the 
rate of technology adoption and 
redeployment of worker time 
into other activities. Combining 
generative AI with all other 
technologies, work automation 
could add 0.5 to 3.4 percentage 
points annually to productivity 
growth. However, workers will need 
support in learning new skills, and 
some will change occupations. If 
worker transitions and other risks 
can be managed, generative AI 
could contribute substantively to 
economic growth and support a 
more sustainable, inclusive world. 

7.  The era of generative AI is just 

beginning. Excitement over this 
technology is palpable, and early 
pilots are compelling. But a full 
realization of the technology’s 
benefits will take time, and leaders 
in business and society still 
have considerable challenges to 
address. These include managing 
the risks inherent in generative 
AI, determining what new skills 
and capabilities the workforce will 
need, and rethinking core business 
processes such as retraining and 
developing new skills.

Generative AI as a 
technology catalyst

To grasp what lies ahead requires an understanding of the breakthroughs that have enabled 
the rise of generative AI, which were decades in the making. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Stable 
Diffusion, and other generative AI tools that have captured current public attention are the 
result of significant levels of investment in recent years that have helped advance machine 
learning and deep learning. This investment undergirds the AI applications embedded in many 
of the products and services we use every day. 

But because AI has permeated our lives incrementally—through everything from the tech 
powering our smartphones to autonomous-driving features on cars to the tools retailers use 
to surprise and delight consumers—its progress was almost imperceptible. Clear milestones, 
such as when AlphaGo, an AI-based program developed by DeepMind, defeated a world 
champion Go player in 2016, were celebrated but then quickly faded from the public’s 
consciousness.

ChatGPT and its competitors have captured the imagination of people around the world 
in a way AlphaGo did not, thanks to their broad utility—almost anyone can use them to 
communicate and create—and preternatural ability to have a conversation with a user. 
The latest generative AI applications can perform a range of routine tasks, such as the 
reorganization and classification of data. But it is their ability to write text, compose music, 
and create digital art that has garnered headlines and persuaded consumers and households 
to experiment on their own. As a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with 
generative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make 
sense of it.

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

How did we get here? Gradually, then all of a sudden 

For the purposes of this report, we define generative AI as applications typically built using 
foundation models. These models contain expansive artificial neural networks inspired by the 
billions of neurons connected in the human brain. Foundation models are part of what is called 
deep learning, a term that alludes to the many deep layers within neural networks. Deep 
learning has powered many of the recent advances in AI, but the foundation models powering 
generative AI applications are a step change evolution within deep learning. Unlike previous 
deep learning models, they can process extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data 
and perform more than one task. 

Foundation models have enabled new capabilities and vastly improved existing ones across 
a broad range of modalities, including images, video, audio, and computer code. AI trained 
on these models can perform several functions; it can classify, edit, summarize, answer 
questions, and draft new content, among other tasks. 

Continued innovation will also bring new challenges. For example, the computational power 
required to train generative AI with hundreds of billions of parameters threatens to become a 
bottleneck in development.2 Further, there’s a significant move—spearheaded by the open-
source community and spreading to the leaders of generative AI companies themselves—to 
make AI more responsible, which could increase its costs. 

Nonetheless, funding for generative AI, though still a fraction of total investments in artificial 
intelligence, is significant and growing rapidly—reaching a total of $12 billion in the first five 
months of 2023 alone. Venture capital and other private external investments in generative 
AI increased by an average compound growth rate of 74 percent annually from 2017 to 2022. 
During the same period, investments in artificial intelligence overall rose annually by 29 
percent, albeit from a higher base. 

The rush to throw money at all things generative AI reflects how quickly its capabilities have 
developed. ChatGPT was released in November 2022. Four months later, OpenAI released 
a new large language model, or LLM, called GPT-4 with markedly improved capabilities.3 
Similarly, by May 2023, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, was able to process 100,000 
tokens of text, equal to about 75,000 words in a minute—the length of the average novel—
compared with roughly 9,000 tokens when it was introduced in March 2023.4 And in May 
2023, Google announced several new features powered by generative AI, including Search 
Generative Experience and a new LLM called PaLM 2 that will power its Bard chatbot, among 
other Google products.5

From a geographic perspective, external private investment in generative AI, mostly from 
tech giants and venture capital firms, is largely concentrated in North America, reflecting the 
continent’s current domination of the overall AI investment landscape. Generative AI–related 
companies based in the United States raised about $8 billion from 2020 to 2022, accounting 
for 75 percent of total investments in such companies during that period.6 

Generative AI has stunned and excited the world with its potential for reshaping how 
knowledge work gets done in industries and business functions across the entire economy. 
Across functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software 
development, it is poised to transform roles and boost performance. In the process, it could 
unlock trillions of dollars in value across sectors from banking to life sciences. We have used 
two overlapping lenses in this report to understand the potential for generative AI to create 
value for companies and alter the workforce. The following sections share our initial findings. 

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Glossary

Application programming interface (API) is a way to programmatically access (usually 
external) models, data sets, or other pieces of software.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of software to perform tasks that traditionally require 
human intelligence.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are composed of interconnected layers of software-based 
calculators known as “neurons.” These networks can absorb vast amounts of input data and 
process that data through multiple layers that extract and learn the data’s features.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks, which are 
layers of connected “neurons” whose connections have parameters or weights that can be 
trained. It is especially effective at learning from unstructured data such as images, text, and 
audio.

Early and late scenarios are the extreme scenarios of our work-automation model. The 
“earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in 
faster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters 
in the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.

Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pretrained foundation model to perform better in 
a specific task. This entails a relatively short period of training on a labeled data set, which 
is much smaller than the data set the model was initially trained on. This additional training 
allows the model to learn and adapt to the nuances, terminology, and specific patterns found 
in the smaller data set.

Foundation models (FM) are deep learning models trained on vast quantities of 
unstructured, unlabeled data that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the box or 
adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning. Examples of these models are GPT-4, PaLM, 
DALL·E 2, and Stable Diffusion.

Generative AI is AI that is typically built using foundation models and has capabilities that 
earlier AI did not have, such as the ability to generate content. Foundation models can also 
be used for nongenerative purposes (for example, classifying user sentiment as negative or 
positive based on call transcripts) while offering significant improvement over earlier models. 
For simplicity, when we refer to generative AI in this article, we include all foundation model 
use cases.

Graphics processing units (GPUs) are computer chips that were originally developed for 
producing computer graphics (such as for video games) and are also useful for deep learning 
applications. In contrast, traditional machine learning and other analyses usually run on 
central processing units (CPUs), normally referred to as a computer’s “processor.”

Large language models (LLMs) make up a class of foundation models that can process 
massive amounts of unstructured text and learn the relationships between words or portions 
of words, known as tokens. This enables LLMs to generate natural-language text, performing 
tasks such as summarization or knowledge extraction. GPT-4 (which underlies ChatGPT) and 
LaMDA (the model behind Bard) are examples of LLMs.

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI in which a model gains capabilities after it is trained 
on, or shown, many example data points. Machine learning algorithms detect patterns and 
learn how to make predictions and recommendations by processing data and experiences, 
rather than by receiving explicit programming instruction. The algorithms also adapt and can 
become more effective in response to new data and experiences.

Modality is a high-level data category such as numbers, text, images, video, and audio.

Productivity from labor is the ratio of GDP to total hours worked in the economy. Labor 
productivity growth comes from increases in the amount of capital available to each worker, 
the education and experience of the workforce, and improvements in technology.

Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing, refining, and optimizing input 
prompts to guide a generative AI model toward producing desired (that is, accurate) outputs.

Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention, is a mechanism that aims to mimic cognitive 
attention, relating different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the 
sequence.

Structured data are tabular data (for example, organized in tables, databases, or 
spreadsheets) that can be used to train some machine learning models effectively.

Transformers are a relatively new neural network architecture that relies on self-attention 
mechanisms to transform a sequence of inputs into a sequence of outputs while focusing its 
attention on important parts of the context around the inputs. Transformers do not rely on 
convolutions or recurrent neural networks.

Technical automation potential refers to the share of the worktime that could be automated. 
We assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through 
an analysis of the component activities of each occupation. We used databases published 
by institutions including the World Bank and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to break 
down about 850 occupations into approximately 2,100 activities, and we determined the 
performance capabilities needed for each activity based on how humans currently perform 
them.

Use cases are targeted applications to a specific business challenge that produces one 
or more measurable outcomes. For example, in marketing, generative AI could be used to 
generate creative content such as personalized emails.

Unstructured data lack a consistent format or structure (for example, text, images, and audio 
files) and typically require more advanced techniques to extract insights.

Generative AI use 
cases across functions 
and industries 

Generative AI is a step change in the evolution of artificial intelligence. As companies 
rush to adapt and implement it, understanding the technology’s potential to deliver value 
to the economy and society at large will help shape critical decisions. We have used two 
complementary lenses to determine where generative AI with its current capabilities could 
deliver the biggest value and how big that value could be (Exhibit 1).

impacts and not to assume additional growth in any particular market.

McKinsey & Company

The first lens scans use cases for generative AI that organizations could adopt. We define 
a “use case” as a targeted application of generative AI to a specific business challenge, 
resulting in one or more measurable outcomes. For example, a use case in marketing is the 
application of generative AI to generate creative content such as personalized emails, the 
measurable outcomes of which potentially include reductions in the cost of generating such 
content and increases in revenue from the enhanced effectiveness of higher-quality content 
at scale. We identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could 
deliver total value in the range of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefits annually 
when applied across industries. 

That would add 15 to 40 percent to the $11.0 trillion to $17.7 trillion of economic value that we 
now estimate nongenerative artificial intelligence and analytics could unlock. (Our previous 
estimate from 2017 was that AI could deliver $9.5 trillion to $15.4 trillion in economic value.) 

Our second lens complements the first by analyzing generative AI’s potential impact on 
the work activities required in some 850 occupations. We modeled scenarios to estimate 
when generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 “detailed work activities”—
such as “communicating with others about operational plans or activities”—that make up 
those occupations across the world economy. This enables us to estimate how the current 
capabilities of generative AI could affect labor productivity across all work currently done by 
the global workforce.

Some of this impact will overlap with cost reductions in the use case analysis described 
above, which we assume are the result of improved labor productivity. Netting out this 
overlap, the total economic benefits of generative AI—including the major use cases we 
explored and the myriad increases in productivity that are likely to materialize when the 
technology is applied across knowledge workers’ activities—amounts to $6.1 trillion to 
$7.9 trillion annually (Exhibit 2).

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

While generative AI is an exciting and rapidly advancing technology, the other applications of 
AI discussed in our previous report continue to account for the majority of the overall potential 
value of AI. Traditional advanced-analytics and machine learning algorithms are highly 
effective at performing numerical and optimization tasks such as predictive modeling, and 
they continue to find new applications in a wide range of industries. However, as generative AI 
continues to develop and mature, it has the potential to open wholly new frontiers in creativity 
and innovation. It has already expanded the possibilities of what AI overall can achieve (please 
see Box 1, “How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases”).

Box 1
How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases

To assess the potential value of generative AI, 
we updated a proprietary McKinsey database of 
potential AI use cases and drew on the experience 
of more than 100 experts in industries and their 
business functions.1 Our updates examined 
use cases of generative AI—specifically, how 
generative AI techniques (primarily transformer-
based neural networks) can be used to solve 
problems not well addressed by previous 
technologies.

We analyzed only use cases for which generative 
AI could deliver a significant improvement in the 
outputs that drive key value. In particular, our 
estimates of the primary value the technology 
could unlock do not include use cases for which 
the sole benefit would be its ability to use natural 
language. For example, natural-language 
capabilities would be the key driver of value in 

a customer service use case but not in a use 
case optimizing a logistics network, where value 
primarily arises from quantitative analysis. 

We then estimated the potential annual value 
of these generative AI use cases if they were 
adopted across the entire economy. For use 
cases aimed at increasing revenue, such as some 
of those in sales and marketing, we estimated 
the economy-wide value generative AI could 
deliver by increasing the productivity of sales and 
marketing expenditures. 

Our estimates are based on the structure of the 
global economy in 2022 and do not consider the 
value generative AI could create if it produced 
entirely new product or service categories.

“Notes from the AI frontier: Applications and value of deep learning,” McKinsey Global Institute, April 17, 2018.

In this chapter, we highlight the value potential of generative AI across two dimensions: 
business function and modality.

Value potential by function

While generative AI could have an impact on most business functions, a few stand out when 
measured by the technology’s impact as a share of functional cost (Exhibit 3). Our analysis 
of 16 business functions identified just four—customer operations, marketing and sales, 
software engineering, and research and development—that could account for approximately 
75 percent of the total annual value from generative AI use cases.

Notably, the potential value of using generative AI for several functions that were prominent 
in our previous sizing of AI use cases, including manufacturing and supply chain functions, 
is now much lower.7 This is largely explained by the nature of generative AI use cases, which 
exclude most of the numerical and optimization applications that were the main value drivers 
for previous applications of AI.

12

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Generative AI as a virtual expert
In addition to the potential value generative AI can deliver in function-specific use cases, 
the technology could drive value across an entire organization by revolutionizing internal 
knowledge management systems. Generative AI’s impressive command of natural-language 
processing can help employees retrieve stored internal knowledge by formulating queries 
in the same way they might ask a human a question and engage in continuing dialogue. This 
could empower teams to quickly access relevant information, enabling them to rapidly make 
better-informed decisions and develop effective strategies.

In 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about 
a fifth of their time, or one day each work week, searching for and gathering information. If 
generative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
workers doing them, the benefits would be huge. Such virtual expertise could rapidly “read” 
vast libraries of corporate information stored in natural language and quickly scan source 
material in dialogue with a human who helps fine-tune and tailor its research, a more scalable 
solution than hiring a team of human experts for the task. 

Following are examples of how generative AI could produce operational benefits as a virtual 
expert in a handful of use cases.

In addition to the potential 
value generative AI can 
deliver in specific use 
cases, the technology 
could drive value across 
an entire organization 
by revolutionizing 
internal knowledge 
management systems.

How customer operations 
could be transformed

Customer self-service interactions

Customer interacts with a humanlike chatbot that 
delivers immediate, personalized responses to 
complex inquiries, ensuring a consistent brand 
voice regardless of customer language or location. 

Customer–agent interactions

Human agent uses AI-developed call scripts and 
receives real-time assistance and suggestions for 
responses during phone conversations, instantly 
accessing relevant customer data for tailored and 
real-time information delivery. 

Agent self-improvement

Agent receives a summarization of the conversation in 
a few succinct points to create a record of customer 
complaints and actions taken.

Agent uses automated, personalized insights generated 
by AI, including tailored follow-up messages or 
personalized coaching suggestions. 

14

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Customer operations
Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the entire customer operations function, 
improving the customer experience and agent productivity through digital self-service 
and enhancing and augmenting agent skills. The technology has already gained traction 
in customer service because of its ability to automate interactions with customers using 
natural language. Research found that at one company with 5,000 customer service 
agents, the application of generative AI increased issue resolution by 14 percent an hour and 
reduced the time spent handling an issue by 9 percent.8 It also reduced agent attrition and 
requests to speak to a manager by 25 percent. Crucially, productivity and quality of service 
improved most among less-experienced agents, while the AI assistant did not increase—
and sometimes decreased—the productivity and quality metrics of more highly skilled 
agents. This is because AI assistance helped less-experienced agents communicate using 
techniques similar to those of their higher-skilled counterparts.

The following are examples of the operational improvements generative AI can have for 
specific use cases:

 — Customer self-service. Generative AI–fueled chatbots can give immediate and 

personalized responses to complex customer inquiries regardless of the language or 
location of the customer. By improving the quality and effectiveness of interactions via 
automated channels, generative AI could automate responses to a higher percentage of 
customer inquiries, enabling customer care teams to take on inquiries that can only be 
resolved by a human agent. Our research found that roughly half of customer contacts 
made by banking, telecommunications, and utilities companies in North America are 
already handled by machines, including but not exclusively AI. We estimate that generative 
AI could further reduce the volume of human-serviced contacts by up to 50 percent, 
depending on a company’s existing level of automation. 

 — Resolution during initial contact. Generative AI can instantly retrieve data a company 

has on a specific customer, which can help a human customer service representative more 
successfully answer questions and resolve issues during an initial interaction.

 — Reduced response time. Generative AI can cut the time a human sales representative 

spends responding to a customer by providing assistance in real time and recommending 
next steps. 

 — Increased sales. Because of its ability to rapidly process data on customers and their 
browsing histories, the technology can identify product suggestions and deals tailored 
to customer preferences. Additionally, generative AI can enhance quality assurance and 
coaching by gathering insights from customer conversations, determining what could be 
done better, and coaching agents. 

We estimate that applying generative AI to customer care functions could increase 
productivity at a value ranging from 30 to 45 percent of current function costs.

Our analysis captures only the direct impact generative AI might have on the productivity of 
customer operations. It does not account for potential knock-on effects the technology may 
have on customer satisfaction and retention arising from an improved experience, including 
better understanding of the customer’s context that can assist human agents in providing 
more personalized help and recommendations.

How marketing and sales 
could be transformed

Strategization

Sales and marketing professionals efficiently 
gather market trends and customer information 
from unstructured data sources (for example, 
social media, news, research, product information, 
and customer feedback) and draft effective 
marketing and sales communications. 

Awareness

Customers see campaigns tailored 
to their segment, language, and 
demographic.

Consideration

Customers can access comprehensive information, 
comparisons, and dynamic recommendations, such as 
personal “try ons.” 

16

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Conversion

Virtual sales representatives enabled by generative 
AI emulate humanlike qualities—such as empathy, 
personalized communication, and natural language 
processing—to build trust and rapport with 
customers. 

Retention

Customers are more likely to be retained with 
customized messages and rewards, and they can 
interact with AI-powered customer-support chatbots 
that manage the relationship proactively, with fewer 
escalations to human agents. 

Marketing and sales
Generative AI has taken hold rapidly in marketing and sales functions, in which text-based 
communications and personalization at scale are driving forces. The technology can create 
personalized messages tailored to individual customer interests, preferences, and behaviors, 
as well as do tasks such as producing first drafts of brand advertising, headlines, slogans, 
social media posts, and product descriptions.

However, introducing generative AI to marketing functions requires careful consideration. 
For one thing, mathematical models trained on publicly available data without sufficient 
safeguards against plagiarism, copyright violations, and branding recognition risks 
infringing on intellectual property rights. A virtual try-on application may produce biased 
representations of certain demographics because of limited or biased training data. Thus, 
significant human oversight is required for conceptual and strategic thinking specific to each 
company’s needs.

Potential operational benefits from using generative AI for marketing include the following: 

 — Efficient and effective content creation. Generative AI could significantly reduce the 

time required for ideation and content drafting, saving valuable time and effort. It can also 
facilitate consistency across different pieces of content, ensuring a uniform brand voice, 
writing style, and format. Team members can collaborate via generative AI, which can 
integrate their ideas into a single cohesive piece. This would allow teams to significantly 
enhance personalization of marketing messages aimed at different customer segments, 
geographies, and demographics. Mass email campaigns can be instantly translated into 
as many languages as needed, with different imagery and messaging depending on the 
audience. Generative AI’s ability to produce content with varying specifications could 
increase customer value, attraction, conversion, and retention over a lifetime and at a 
scale beyond what is currently possible through traditional techniques.

 — Enhanced use of data. Generative AI could help marketing functions overcome the 
challenges of unstructured, inconsistent, and disconnected data—for example, from 
different databases—by interpreting abstract data sources such as text, image, and 
varying structures. It can help marketers better use data such as territory performance, 
synthesized customer feedback, and customer behavior to generate data-informed 
marketing strategies such as targeted customer profiles and channel recommendations. 
Such tools could identify and synthesize trends, key drivers, and market and product 
opportunities from unstructured data such as social media, news, academic research, and 
customer feedback.

 — SEO optimization. Generative AI can help marketers achieve higher conversion and 

lower cost through search engine optimization (SEO) for marketing and sales technical 
components such as page titles, image tags, and URLs. It can synthesize key SEO tokens, 
support specialists in SEO digital content creation, and distribute targeted content to 
customers.

 — Product discovery and search personalization. With generative AI, product discovery 

and search can be personalized with multimodal inputs from text, images and speech, and 
deep understanding of customer profiles. For example, technology can leverage individual 
user preferences, behavior, and purchase history to help customers discover the most 
relevant products and generate personalized product descriptions. This would allow CPG, 
travel, and retail companies to improve their ecommerce sales by achieving higher website 
conversion rates. 

We estimate that generative AI could increase the productivity of the marketing function with 
a value between 5 and 15 percent of total marketing spending.

Our analysis of the potential use of generative AI in marketing doesn’t account for knock-on 
effects beyond the direct impacts on productivity. Generative AI–enabled synthesis could 
provide higher-quality data insights, leading to new ideas for marketing campaigns and 
better-targeted customer segments. Marketing functions could shift resources to producing 
higher-quality content for owned channels, potentially reducing spending on external 
channels and agencies.

Generative AI could also change the way both B2B and B2C companies approach sales. The 
following are two use cases for sales:

 — Increase probability of sale. Generative AI could identify and prioritize sales leads 

by creating comprehensive consumer profiles from structured and unstructured data 
and suggesting actions to staff to improve client engagement at every point of contact. 
For example, generative AI could provide better information about client preferences, 
potentially improving close rates. 

 — Improve lead development. Generative AI could help sales representatives nurture leads 
by synthesizing relevant product sales information and customer profiles and creating 
discussion scripts to facilitate customer conversation, including up- and cross-selling 
talking points. It could also automate sales follow-ups and passively nurture leads until 
clients are ready for direct interaction with a human sales agent.

Our analysis suggests that implementing generative AI could increase sales productivity by 
approximately 3 to 5 percent of current global sales expenditures.

This analysis may not fully account for additional revenue that generative AI could bring 
to sales functions. For instance, generative AI’s ability to identify leads and follow-up 
capabilities could uncover new leads and facilitate more effective outreach that would bring 
in additional revenue. Also, the time saved by sales representatives due to generative AI’s 
capabilities could be invested in higher-quality customer interactions, resulting in increased 
sales success.

Generative AI as a virtual collaborator
In other cases, generative AI can drive value by working in partnership with workers, 
augmenting their work in ways that accelerate their productivity. Its ability to rapidly digest 
mountains of data and draw conclusions from it enables the technology to offer insights and 
options that can dramatically enhance knowledge work. This can significantly speed up the 
process of developing a product and allow employees to devote more time to higher-impact 
tasks. 

Generative AI could increase 
sales productivity by 3 to 
5 percent of current global 
sales expenditures.

How software engineering 
could be transformed

Inception and planning

Software engineers and product managers use 
generative AI to assist in analyzing, cleaning, and labeling 
large volumes of data, such as user feedback, market 
trends, and existing system logs.

System design

Engineers use generative AI to create multiple IT 
architecture designs and iterate on the potential 
configurations, accelerating system design, and 
allowing faster time to market.

Coding

Engineers are assisted by AI tools that can code, 
reducing development time by assisting with drafts, 
rapidly finding prompts, and serving as an easily 
navigable knowledge base. 

Testing

Engineers employ algorithms that can enhance 
functional and performance testing to ensure 
quality and can generate test cases and test data 
automatically.

20

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Maintenance

Engineers use AI insights on system logs, user feedback, 
and performance data to help diagnose issues, 
suggest fixes, and predict other high-priority areas of 
improvement. 

Software engineering
Treating computer languages as just another language opens new possibilities for software 
engineering. Software engineers can use generative AI in pair programming and to do 
augmented coding and train LLMs to develop applications that generate code when given a 
natural-language prompt describing what that code should do.

Software engineering is a significant function in most companies, and it continues to grow 
as all large companies, not just tech titans, embed software in a wide array of products and 
services. For example, much of the value of new vehicles comes from digital features such as 
adaptive cruise control, parking assistance, and IoT connectivity.

According to our analysis, the direct impact of AI on the productivity of software engineering 
could range from 20 to 45 percent of current annual spending on the function. This value 
would arise primarily from reducing time spent on certain activities, such as generating initial 
code drafts, code correction and refactoring, root-cause analysis, and generating new system 
designs. By accelerating the coding process, generative AI could push the skill sets and 
capabilities needed in software engineering toward code and architecture design. One study 
found that software developers using Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot completed tasks 56 percent 
faster than those not using the tool.9 An internal McKinsey empirical study of software 
engineering teams found those who were trained to use generative AI tools rapidly reduced 
the time needed to generate and refactor code—and engineers also reported a better work 
experience, citing improvements in happiness, flow, and fulfillment. 

Our analysis did not account for the increase in application quality and the resulting boost in 
productivity that generative AI could bring by improving code or enhancing IT architecture—
which can improve productivity across the IT value chain. However, the quality of IT 
architecture still largely depends on software architects, rather than on initial drafts that 
generative AI’s current capabilities allow it to produce.

Large technology companies are already selling generative AI for software engineering, 
including GitHub Copilot, which is now integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4, and Replit, used by 
more than 20 million coders.10

How product R&D 
could be transformed

Early research analysis

Researchers use generative AI to enhance market reporting, 
ideation, and product or solution drafting. 

Virtual design

Researchers use generative AI to generate 
prompt-based drafts and designs, allowing them 
to iterate quickly with more design options. 

Virtual simulations

Researchers accelerate and optimize the 
virtual simulation phase if combined with new 
deep learning generative design techniques. 

Physical test planning

Researchers optimize test cases for more 
efficient testing, reducing the time required 
for physical build and testing.

Product R&D
Generative AI’s potential in R&D is perhaps less well recognized than its potential in other 
business functions. Still, our research indicates the technology could deliver productivity with 
a value ranging from 10 to 15 percent of overall R&D costs.

For example, the life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI 
foundation models in their R&D for what is known as generative design. Foundation models 
can generate candidate molecules, accelerating the process of developing new drugs and 
materials. Entos, a biotech pharmaceutical company, has paired generative AI with automated 
synthetic development tools to design small-molecule therapeutics. But the same principles 
can be applied to the design of many other products, including larger-scale physical products 
and electrical circuits, among others. 

22

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

While other generative design techniques have already unlocked some of the potential to apply 
AI in R&D, their cost and data requirements, such as the use of “traditional” machine learning, 
can limit their application. Pretrained foundation models that underpin generative AI, or models 
that have been enhanced with fine-tuning, have much broader areas of application than models 
optimized for a single task. They can therefore accelerate time to market and broaden the types 
of products to which generative design can be applied. For now, however, foundation models 
lack the capabilities to help design products across all industries.

In addition to the productivity gains that result from being able to quickly produce candidate 
designs, generative design can also enable improvements in the designs themselves, as in the 
following examples of the operational improvements generative AI could bring: 

 — Enhanced design. Generative AI can help product designers reduce costs by selecting and 
using materials more efficiently. It can also optimize designs for manufacturing, which can 
lead to cost reductions in logistics and production. 

 — Improved product testing and quality. Using generative AI in generative design can 

produce a higher-quality product, resulting in increased attractiveness and market appeal. 
Generative AI can help to reduce testing time of complex systems and accelerate trial 
phases involving customer testing through its ability to draft scenarios and profile testing 
candidates. 

We also identified a new R&D use case for nongenerative AI: deep learning surrogates, the use 
of which has grown since our earlier research, can be paired with generative AI to produce even 
greater benefits (see Box 2, “Deep learning surrogates”). To be sure, integration will require the 
development of specific solutions, but the value could be significant because deep learning 
surrogates have the potential to accelerate the testing of designs proposed by generative AI. 

While we have estimated the potential direct impacts of generative AI on the R&D function, 
we did not attempt to estimate the technology’s potential to create entirely novel product 
categories. These are the types of innovations that can produce step changes not only in the 
performance of individual companies but in economic growth overall.

Box 2
Deep learning surrogates

Product design in industries producing 
physical products often involves physics-
based virtual simulations such as 
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and 
finite element analysis (FEA). Although 
they are faster than actual physical 
testing, these techniques can be time- 
and resource-intensive, especially for 
designing complex parts—running CFD 
simulations on graphics processing units 

can take hours. And these techniques 
are even more complex and compute-
intensive when they involve simulations 
coupled across multiple disciplines (for 
example, physical stress and temperature 
distribution), which is sometimes called 
multiphysics.

Deep learning applications are now 
revolutionizing the virtual testing phase of 

the R&D process by using deep learning 
models to emulate (multi)physics-
based simulations at higher speeds and 
lower costs. Instead of taking hours 
to run physics-based models, these 
deep learning surrogates can produce 
the results of simulations in just a few 
seconds, allowing researchers to test 
many more designs and enabling faster 
decision making on products and designs.

23

Value potential by modality

Technology has revolutionized the way we conduct business, and text-based AI is on the 
frontier of this change. Indeed, text-based data is plentiful, accessible, and easily processed 
and analyzed at large scale by LLMs, which has prompted a strong emphasis on them in the 
initial stages of generative AI development. The current investment landscape in generative 
AI is also heavily focused on text-based applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and 
language translation. However, we estimate that almost one-fifth of the value that generative 
AI can unlock across our use cases would take advantage of multimodal capabilities beyond 
text to text.

While most of generative AI’s initial traction has been in text-based use cases, recent 
advances in generative AI have also led to breakthroughs in image generation, as OpenAI’s 
DALL·E and Stable Diffusion have so amply illustrated, and much progress is being made in 
audio, including voice and music, and video. These capabilities have obvious applications 
in marketing for generating advertising materials and other marketing content, and these 
technologies are already being applied in media industries, including game design. Indeed, 
some of these examples challenge existing business models around talent, monetization, and 
intellectual property.11

The multimodal capabilities of generative AI could also be used effectively in R&D. Generative 
AI systems could create first drafts of circuit designs, architectural drawings, structural 
engineering designs, and thermal designs based on prompts that describe requirements for 
a product. Achieving this will require training foundation models in these domains (think of 
LLMs trained on “design languages”). Once trained, such foundation models could increase 
productivity on a similar magnitude to software development.

Value potential by industry

Across the 63 use cases we analyzed, generative AI has the potential to generate $2.6 trillion 
to $4.4 trillion in value across industries. Its precise impact will depend on a variety of factors, 
such as the mix and importance of different functions, as well as the scale of an industry’s 
revenue (Exhibit 4).

For example, our analysis estimates generative AI could contribute roughly $310 billion in 
additional value for the retail industry (including auto dealerships) by boosting performance in 
functions such as marketing and customer interactions. By comparison, the bulk of potential

McKinsey & Company

In the banking industry, generative AI has the potential to improve on efficiencies already 
delivered by artificial intelligence by taking on lower-value tasks in risk management, such 
as required reporting, monitoring regulatory developments, and collecting data. In the life 
sciences industry, generative AI is poised to make significant contributions to drug discovery 
and development.

We share our detailed analysis of these industries in the following industry spotlights. 

26

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Spotlight: Retail and CPG

Generative AI could change the game for retail 
and consumer packaged goods companies

The technology could generate value for 
the retail and consumer packaged goods 
(CPG) industry by increasing productivity 
by 1.2 to 2.0 percent of annual revenues, 
or an additional $400 billion to $660 bil-
lion.1 To streamline processes, generative 
AI could automate key functions such as 
customer service, marketing and sales, 
and inventory and supply chain manage-
ment. 

Technology has played an essen-
tial role in the retail and CPG indus-
tries for decades. Traditional AI and 
advanced-analytics solutions have 
helped companies manage vast pools 
of data across large numbers of SKUs, 
expansive supply chain and warehousing 
networks, and complex product catego-
ries such as consumables. 

In addition, the industries are heavily 
customer facing, which offers opportu-
nities for generative AI to complement 
previously existing artificial intelli-
gence. For example, generative AI’s 
ability to personalize offerings could 
optimize marketing and sales activities 
already handled by existing AI solutions. 
Similarly, generative AI tools excel at data 
management and could support existing 
AI-driven pricing tools. Applying gener-
ative AI to such activities could be a step 
toward integrating applications across a 
full enterprise.

Generative AI is already at work in some 
retail and CPG companies:

Reinvention of the customer 
interaction pattern
Consumers increasingly seek customiza-
tion in everything from clothing and cos-
metics to curated shopping experiences, 
personalized outreach, and food—and 
generative AI can improve that expe-
rience. Generative AI can aggregate 
market data to test concepts, ideas, and 
models. Stitch Fix, which uses algorithms 
to suggest style choices to its custom-
ers, has experimented with DALL·E to 
visualize products based on customer 
preferences regarding color, fabric, and 

style. Using text-to-image generation, 
the company’s stylists can visualize an 
article of clothing based on a consumer’s 
preferences and then identify a similar 
article among Stitch Fix’s inventory. 

Retailers can create applications that 
give shoppers a next-generation experi-
ence, creating a significant competitive 
advantage in an era when customers 
expect to have a single natural-language 
interface help them select products. For 
example, generative AI can improve the 
process of choosing and ordering ingre-
dients for a meal or preparing food—
imagine a chatbot that could pull up the 
most popular tips from the comments 
attached to a recipe. There is also a big 
opportunity to enhance customer value 
management by delivering personalized 
marketing campaigns through a chatbot. 
Such applications can have human-like 
conversations about products in ways 
that can increase customer satisfaction, 
traffic, and brand loyalty. Generative 
AI offers retailers and CPG companies 
many opportunities to cross-sell and 
upsell, collect insights to improve prod-
uct offerings, and increase their cus-
tomer base, revenue opportunities, and 
overall marketing ROI.

Accelerating the creation 
of value in key areas 
Generative AI tools can facilitate copy 
writing for marketing and sales, help 
brainstorm creative marketing ideas, 
expedite consumer research, and accel-
erate content analysis and creation. The 
potential improvement in writing and 
visuals can increase awareness and 
improve sales conversion rates.

Rapid resolution and enhanced 
insights in customer care
The growth of e-commerce also elevates 
the importance of effective consumer 
interactions. Retailers can combine 
existing AI tools with generative AI to 
enhance the capabilities of chatbots, 
enabling them to better mimic the 
interaction style of human agents—for 

example, by responding directly to a 
customer’s query, tracking or cancel-
ing an order, offering discounts, and 
upselling. Automating repetitive tasks 
allows human agents to devote more 
time to handling complicated customer 
problems and obtaining contextual infor-
mation.

Disruptive and creative innovation
Generative AI tools can enhance the 
process of developing new versions 
of products by digitally creating new 
designs rapidly. A designer can generate 
packaging designs from scratch or gen-
erate variations on an existing design. 
This technology is developing rapidly and 
has the potential to add text-to-video 
generation. 

Additional factors to consider
As retail and CPG executives explore 
how to integrate generative AI in their 
operations, they should keep in mind 
several factors that could affect their 
ability to capture value from the technol-
ogy. 

External inference. Generative AI has 
increased the need to understand 
whether generated content is based on 
fact or inference, requiring a new level of 
quality control.

Adversarial attacks. Foundation models 
are a prime target for attack by hackers 
and other bad actors, increasing the vari-
ety of potential security vulnerabilities 
and privacy risks.

To address these concerns, retail and 
CPG companies will need to strate-
gically keep humans in the loop and 
ensure security and privacy are top 
considerations for any implementation. 
Companies will need to institute new 
quality checks for processes previous-
ly handled by humans, such as emails 
written by customer reps, and per-
form more-detailed quality checks on 
AI-assisted processes such as product 
design.

Spotlight: Banking

Banks could realize substantial 
value from generative AI 

Generative AI could have a significant 
impact on the banking industry,  gener-
ating value from increased productivity 
of 2.8 to 4.7 percent of the industry’s 
annual revenues, or an additional $200 
billion to $340 billion. On top of that 
impact, the use of generative AI tools 
could also enhance customer satis-
faction, improve decision making and 
employee experience, and decrease 
risks through better monitoring of fraud 
and risk. 

Banking, a knowledge and technolo-
gy-enabled industry, has already bene-
fited significantly from previously exist-
ing applications of artificial intelligence 
in areas such as marketing and custom-
er operations.1 Generative AI applica-
tions could deliver additional benefits, 
especially because text modalities are 
prevalent in areas such as regulations 
and programming language, and the 
industry is customer facing, with many 
B2C and small-business customers.2 

Several characteristics position the 
industry for the integration of genera-
tive AI applications:

 — Sustained digitization efforts along 
with legacy IT systems. Banks 
have been investing in technology 
for decades, accumulating a 
significant amount of technical debt 
along with a siloed and complex IT 
architecture.3

 — Large customer-facing workforces. 
Banking relies on a large number 
of service representatives such 
as call-center agents and wealth 
management financial advisers. 

 — A stringent regulatory environment. 
As a heavily regulated industry, 

banking has a substantial number of 
risk, compliance, and legal needs.

 — White-collar industry. Generative 

AI’s impact could span the 
organization, assisting all 
employees in writing emails, 
creating business presentations, 
and other tasks.

On the move

Banks have started to grasp the poten-
tial of generative AI in their front lines 
and in their software activities. Early 
adopters are harnessing solutions such 
as ChatGPT as well as industry-specific 
solutions, primarily for software and 
knowledge applications. Three uses 
demonstrate its value potential to the 
industry:

A virtual expert to augment 
employee performance
A generative AI bot trained on pro-
prietary knowledge such as policies, 
research, and customer interaction 
could provide always-on, deep techni-
cal support. Today, frontline spending 
is dedicated mostly to validating offers 
and interacting with clients, but giv-
ing frontline workers access to data 
as well could improve the customer 
experience. The technology could also 
monitor industries and clients and 
send alerts on semantic queries from 
public sources. For example, Morgan 
Stanley is building an AI assistant using 
GPT-4, with the aim of helping tens of 
thousands of wealth managers quickly 
find and synthesize answers from a 
massive internal knowledge base.4 The 
model combines search and content 
creation so wealth managers can find 
and tailor information for any client at 
any moment.

One European bank has leveraged gen-
erative AI to develop an environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) virtual 
expert by synthesizing and extracting 
from long documents with unstruc-
tured information. The model answers 
complex questions based on a prompt, 
identifying the source of each answer 
and extracting information from pic-
tures and tables.

Generative AI could reduce the signifi-
cant costs associated with back-office 
operations. Such customer-facing 
chatbots could assess user requests 
and select the best service expert to 
address them based on characteristics 
such as topic, level of difficulty, and 
type of customer. Through generative 
AI assistants, service professionals 
could rapidly access all relevant infor-
mation such as product guides and 
policies to instantaneously address 
customer requests. 

Code acceleration to reduce tech 
debt and deliver software faster
Generative AI tools are useful for soft-
ware development in four broad cate-
gories. First, they can draft code based 
on context via input code or natural 
language, helping developers code 
more quickly and with reduced friction 
while enabling automatic translations 
and no- and low-code tools. Second, 
such tools can automatically generate, 
prioritize, run, and review different 
code tests, accelerating testing and 
increasing coverage and effectiveness. 
Third, generative AI’s natural-language 
translation capabilities can optimize 
the integration and migration of legacy

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Production of tailored 
content at scale
Generative AI tools can draw on existing 
documents and data sets to substan-
tially streamline content generation. 
These tools can create personalized 
marketing and sales content tailored 
to specific client profiles and histories 
as well as a multitude of alternatives 
for A/B testing. In addition, generative 
AI could automatically produce model 
documentation, identify missing docu-
mentation, and scan relevant regulatory 
updates to create alerts for relevant 
shifts. 

Factors for banks to consider

When exploring how to integrate gen-
erative AI into operations, banks can be 
mindful of a number of factors: 

 — The level of regulation for different 

processes. These vary from 
unregulated processes such 
as customer service to heavily 
regulated processes such as credit 
risk scoring.

 — Type of end user. End users vary 
widely in their expectations and 
familiarity with generative AI—for 

example, employees compared with 
high-net-worth clients.

 — Intended level of work automation. 
AI agents integrated through APIs 
could act nearly autonomously 
or as copilots, giving real-time 
suggestions to agents during 
customer interactions.

 — Data constraints. While public data 
such as annual reports could be 
made widely available, there would 
need to be limits on identifiable 
details for customers and other 
internal data. 

A generative AI bot trained 
on proprietary knowledge 
such as policies, research, 
and customer interaction 
could provide always-on, 
deep technical support.

Spotlight: Pharmaceuticals and medical products

Generative AI deployment could unlock 
potential value equal to 2.6 to 4.5 percent of 
annual revenues across the pharmaceutical 
and medical-product industries

Our analysis finds that generative AI 
could have a significant impact on the 
pharmaceutical and medical-product 
industries—from $60 billion to $110 bil-
lion annually. This big potential reflects 
the resource-intensive process of dis-
covering new drug compounds. Pharma 
companies typically spend approximate-
ly 20 percent of revenues on R&D,1 and 
the development of a new drug takes an 
average of ten to 15 years. 

With this level of spending and time-
line, improving the speed and quality 
of R&D can generate substantial value. 
For example, lead identification—a 
step in the drug discovery process in 
which researchers identify a molecule 
that would best address the target for 
a potential new drug—can take several 
months even with “traditional” deep 
learning techniques. Foundation models 
and generative AI can enable organiza-
tions to complete this step in a matter of 
weeks. 

Generative AI use cases 
aligned to industry needs
Drug discovery involves narrowing the 
universe of possible compounds to those 
that could effectively treat specific con-
ditions. Generative AI’s ability to process 
massive amounts of data and model 
options can accelerate output across 
several use cases: 

Improve automation of 
preliminary screening
In the lead identification stage of drug 
development, scientists can use founda-
tion models to automate the preliminary 
screening of chemicals in the search for 
those that will produce specific effects 
on drug targets. To start, thousands of 
cell cultures are tested and paired with 
images of the corresponding experi-

ment. Using an off-the-shelf foundation 
model, researchers can cluster similar 
images more precisely than they can 
with traditional models, enabling them to 
select the most promising chemicals for 
further analysis during lead optimization. 

Enhance indication finding
An important phase of drug discovery 
involves the identification and prioriti-
zation of new indications—that is, dis-
eases, symptoms, or circumstances that 
justify the use of a specific medication 
or other treatment, such as a test, pro-
cedure, or surgery. Possible indications 
for a given drug are based on a patient 
group’s clinical history and medical 
records, and they are then prioritized 
based on their similarities to established 
and evidence-backed indications. 

Researchers start by mapping the 
patient cohort’s clinical events and 
medical histories—including potential 
diagnoses, prescribed medications, 
and performed procedures—from real-
world data. Using foundation models, 
researchers can quantify clinical events, 
establish relationships, and measure the 
similarity between the patient cohort 
and evidence-backed indications. The 
result is a short list of indications that 
have a better probability of success in 
clinical trials because they can be more 
accurately matched to appropriate 
patient groups.

Pharma companies that have used this 
approach have reported high success 
rates in clinical trials for the top five indi-
cations recommended by a foundation 
model for a tested drug. This success 
has allowed these drugs to progress 
smoothly into Phase 3 trials, significantly 
accelerating the drug development pro-
cess.

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Additional factors to consider
Before integrating generative AI into 
operations, pharma executives should 
be aware of some factors that could limit 
their ability to capture its benefits:

 — The need for a human in the loop. 

Companies may need to implement 
new quality checks on processes 
that shift from humans to generative 
AI, such as representative-generated 
emails, or more detailed quality 
checks on AI-assisted processes, 
such as drug discovery. The 
increasing need to verify whether 
generated content is based on fact 
or inference elevates the need for a 
new level of quality control.

 — Explainability. A lack of transparency 
into the origins of generated content 
and traceability of root data could 
make it difficult to update models 
and scan them for potential risks; 
for instance, a generative AI solution 
for synthesizing scientific literature 
may not be able to point to the 
specific articles or quotes that led 
it to infer that a new treatment is 
very popular among physicians. The 
technology can also “hallucinate,” 
or generate responses that are 
obviously incorrect or inappropriate 
for the context. Systems need to be 
designed to point to specific articles 
or data sources, and then do human-
in-the-loop checking. 

 — Privacy considerations. Generative 
AI’s use of clinical images and 
medical records could increase the 
risk that protected health information 
will leak, potentially violating 
regulations that require pharma 
companies to protect patient privacy. 

In this chapter, we have estimated the organizational value generative AI could deliver 
through use cases across industries and business functions, but the technology’s potential 
is much greater. As it is embedded into tools used by every knowledge worker, its additional 
impact may be more diffuse but no less valuable than that associated with these use cases. 
Companies need to find ways to maximize the value created by the generative AI they deploy 
while also taking care to monitor and manage its impact on their workforces and society at 
large.

The generative AI future 
of work: Impacts on 
work activities, economic 
growth, and productivity 

Technology has been changing the anatomy of work for decades. Over the years, machines 
have given human workers various “superpowers”; for instance, industrial-age machines 
enabled workers to accomplish physical tasks beyond the capabilities of their own bodies. 
More recently, computers have enabled knowledge workers to perform calculations that 
would have taken years to do manually. 

These examples illustrate how technology can augment work through the automation of 
individual activities that workers would have otherwise had to do themselves. At a conceptual 
level, the application of generative AI may follow the same pattern in the modern workplace, 
although as we show later in this chapter, the types of activities that generative AI could 
affect, and the types of occupations with activities that could change, will likely be different as 
a result of this technology than for older technologies.

The McKinsey Global Institute began analyzing the impact of technological automation 
of work activities and modeling scenarios of adoption in 2017. At that time, we estimated 
that workers spent half of their time on activities that had the potential to be automated by 

32

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

adapting technology that existed at that time, or what we call technical automation potential. 
We also modeled a range of potential scenarios for the pace at which these technologies 
could be adopted and affect work activities throughout the global economy. 

Technology adoption at scale does not occur overnight. The potential of technological 
capabilities in a lab does not necessarily mean they can be immediately integrated into a 
solution that automates a specific work activity—developing such solutions takes time. Even 
when such a solution is developed, it might not be economically feasible to use if its costs 
exceed those of human labor. Additionally, even if economic incentives for deployment exist, it 
takes time for adoption to spread across the global economy. Hence, our adoption scenarios, 
which consider these factors together with the technical automation potential, provide a 
sense of the pace and scale at which workers’ activities could shift over time.

Large-scale shifts in the mix of work activities and occupations are not unprecedented. 
Consider the work of a farmer today compared with what a farmer did just a few short years 
ago. Many farmers now access market information on mobile phones to determine when and 
where to sell their crops or download sophisticated modeling of weather patterns. From a 
more macro perspective, agricultural employment in China went from an 82 percent share of 
all workers in 1962 to 13 percent in 2013. Labor markets are also dynamic: millions of people 
leave their jobs every month in the United States.12 But this does not minimize the challenges 
faced by individual workers whose lives are upended by these shifts, or the organizational or 
societal challenges of ensuring that workers have the skills to take on the work that will be in 
demand and that their incomes are sufficient to grow their standards of living. 

Also, demographics have made such shifts in activities a necessity from a macroeconomic 
perspective. An economic growth gap has opened as a result of the slowing growth of the 
world’s workforce. In some major countries, workforces have shrunk because populations are 
aging. Labor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance 
prosperity.

The analyses in this paper incorporate the potential impact of generative AI on today’s work 
activities. The new capabilities of generative AI, combined with previous technologies and 
integrated into corporate operations around the world, could accelerate the potential for 
technical automation of individual activities and the adoption of technologies that augment 
the capabilities of the workforce. They could also have an impact on knowledge workers 
whose activities were not expected to shift as a result of these technologies until later in the 
future (see Box 3, “About the research”). 

Labor productivity will 
have to accelerate to 
achieve economic growth 
and enhance prosperity.

Box 3
About the research

This analysis builds on the methodology 
we established in 2017. We began by 
examining the US Bureau of Labor 
Statistics O*Net breakdown of about 
850 occupations into roughly 2,100 
detailed work activities. For each of 
these activities, we scored the level of 
capability necessary to successfully 
perform the activity against a set of 18 
capabilities that have the potential for 
automation (exhibit).

We also surveyed experts in the 
automation of each of these capabilities 
to estimate automation technologies’ 
current performance level against each 
of these capabilities, as well as how 
the technology’s performance might 
advance over time. Specifically, this 
year, we updated our assessments of 
technology’s performance in cognitive, 
language, and social and emotional 
capabilities based on a survey of 
generative AI experts. 

Exhibit

Based on these assessments of the 
technical automation potential of each 
detailed work activity at each point in 
time, we modeled potential scenarios for 
the adoption of work automation around 
the world. First, we estimated a range 
of time to implement a solution that 
could automate each specific detailed 
work activity, once all the capability 
requirements were met by the state of 
technology development. Second, we 
estimated a range of potential costs 
for this technology when it is first 
introduced, and then declining over 
time, based on historical precedents. 
We modeled the beginning of adoption 
for a specific detailed work activity in a 
particular occupation in a country (for 47 
countries, accounting for more than 80 
percent of the global workforce) when 
the cost of the automation technology 
reaches parity with the cost of human 
labor in that occupation.

Based on a historical analysis of 
various technologies, we modeled a 
range of adoption timelines from eight 
to 27 years between the beginning 
of adoption and its plateau, using 
sigmoidal curves (S-curves). This range 
implicitly accounts for the many factors 
that could affect the pace at which 
adoption occurs, including regulation, 
levels of investment, and management 
decision making within firms.

The modeled scenarios create a 
time range for the potential pace of 
automating current work activities. 
The “earliest” scenario flexes all 
parameters to the extremes of plausible 
assumptions, resulting in faster 
automation development and adoption, 
and the “latest” scenario flexes all 
parameters in the opposite direction. 
The reality is likely to fall somewhere 
between the two.

Our analysis assesses the potential for technical automation 
across some 2,100 activities and 18 capabilities.

Accelerating the technical potential to transform knowledge work

Based on developments in generative AI, technology performance is now expected to 
match median human performance and reach top quartile human performance earlier 
than previously estimated across a wide range of capabilities (Exhibit 6). For example, MGI 
previously identified 2027 as the earliest year when median human performance for natural-
language understanding might be achieved in technology, but in this new analysis, the 
corresponding point is 2023.

As a result of generative AI, experts assess that technology could achieve human-
level performance in some technical capabilities sooner than previously thought.

As a result of these reassessments of technology capabilities due to generative AI, the total 
percentage of hours that could theoretically be automated by integrating technologies 
that exist today has increased from about 50 percent to 60–70 percent. The technical 
potential curve is quite steep because of the acceleration in generative AI’s natural-language 
capabilities (Exhibit 7).

Interestingly, the range of times between the early and late scenarios has compressed 
compared with the expert assessments in 2017, reflecting a greater confidence that higher 
levels of technological capabilities will arrive by certain time periods.

The advent of generative AI has pulled forward the potential for 
technical automation.

Adoption lags behind technical automation potential
Our analysis of adoption scenarios accounts for the time required to integrate technological 
capabilities into solutions that can automate individual work activities; the cost of these 
technologies compared with that of human labor in different occupations and countries 
around the world; and the time it has taken for technologies to diffuse across the economy. 
With the acceleration in technical automation potential that generative AI enables, our 
scenarios for automation adoption have correspondingly accelerated. These scenarios 
encompass a wide range of outcomes, given that the pace at which solutions will be 
developed and adopted will vary based on decisions that will be made on investments, 

36

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

deployment, and regulation, among other factors. But they give an indication of the degree to 
which the activities that workers do each day may shift. 

As an example of how this might play out in a specific occupation, consider postsecondary 
English language and literature teachers, whose detailed work activities include preparing 
tests and evaluating student work. With generative AI’s enhanced natural-language 
capabilities, more of these activities could be done by machines, perhaps initially to create 
a first draft that is edited by teachers but perhaps eventually with far less human editing 
required. This could free up time for these teachers to spend more time on other work 
activities, such as guiding class discussions or tutoring students who need extra assistance.

Our previously modeled adoption scenarios suggested that 50 percent of time spent on 2016 
work activities would be automated sometime between 2035 and 2070, with a midpoint 
scenario around 2053. Our updated adoption scenarios, which account for developments in 
generative AI, models the time spent on 2023 work activities reaching 50 percent automation 
between 2030 and 2060, with a midpoint of 2045—an acceleration of roughly a decade 
compared with the previous estimate (Exhibit 8).13

Different countries, different pace of adoption
Adoption is also likely to be faster in developed countries, where wages are higher and 
thus the economic feasibility of adopting automation occurs earlier. Even if the potential for 
technology to automate a particular work activity is high, the costs required to do so have to 
be compared with the cost of human wages. In countries such as China, India, and Mexico, 
where wage rates are lower, automation adoption is modeled to arrive more slowly than in 
higher-wage countries (Exhibit 9).

higher wages will make it economically feasible sooner.

Our analyses of generative AI’s impact on work activities and the pace of automation adoption 
rely on several assumptions and sensitivities (see Box 4, “Limitations of our analyses, key 
assumptions, and sensitivities”). 

38

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Box 4
Limitations of our analyses, key assumptions, and sensitivities

This analysis considers the potential for 
automation only of current work activities 
and occupations. It does not account 
for how those work activities may shift 
over time or forecast new activities and 
occupations.1 Also, the analysis accounts 
solely for first-order effects. It does not 
take into account how labor rates could 
change, and it does not model changes 
in labor force participation rates or other 
general equilibrium effects. That said, 
while these models account for the time 
it may take for technology to be adopted 
across an economy, technologies could 
be adopted much more rapidly in an 
individual organization. Other research 
may reach different conclusions.

Our assessments of technology 
capabilities are based on the best 
estimates of experts involved in 

developing automation technologies. 
These assessments could change over 
time, as they have changed since 2017. 

The technology adoption curves 
are based on historical findings that 
technologies take eight to 27 years from 
commercial availability to reach a plateau 
in adoption. Some argue that the adoption 
of generative AI will be faster due to the 
ease of deploying these technologies. 
That said, the case for a minimum of 
eight years in our earliest scenario for 
reaching a global plateau in adoption 
accounts for the pace of adoption of other 
technologies that have arguably had a 
faster adoption potential—for example, 
social networking as a consumer 
technology that faced no barriers in 
enterprise change management. Our 
scenario also accounts for the significant 

role of small and midsize enterprises 
around the world, in addition to the 
challenges of incorporating and managing 
change in larger organizations. 

In addition, this analysis does not assume 
that the scale of work automation 
equates directly to job losses. Like other 
technologies, generative AI typically 
enables individual activities within 
occupations to be automated, not entire 
occupations. Historically, the activities 
in many occupations have shifted over 
time as certain activities are automated. 
However, organizations may decide 
to realize the benefits of increased 
productivity by reducing employment 
in some job categories, a possibility we 
cannot rule out.

activities involving decision 
making and collaboration, 
which previously had the lowest 
potential for automation.

39

Generative AI’s potential impact on knowledge work 

Previous generations of automation technology were particularly effective at automating 
data management tasks related to collecting and processing data. Generative AI’s natural-
language capabilities increase the automation potential of these types of activities somewhat. 
But its impact on more physical work activities shifted much less, which isn’t surprising 
because its capabilities are fundamentally engineered to do cognitive tasks.

As a result, generative AI is likely to have the biggest impact on knowledge work, particularly 
activities involving decision making and collaboration, which previously had the lowest 
potential for automation (Exhibit 10). Our estimate of the technical potential to automate 
the application of expertise jumped 34 percentage points, while the potential to automate 
management  and develop talent increased from 16 percent in 2017 to 49 percent in 2023. 

Generative AI’s ability to understand and use natural language for a variety of activities and 
tasks largely explains why automation potential has risen so steeply. Some 40 percent of 
the activities that workers perform in the economy require at least a median level of human 
understanding of natural language. 

Exhibit 10

Generative AI could have the biggest impact on collaboration and the application 
of expertise, activities that previously had a lower potential for automation.

documentation, and interacting with people in general have the potential to be automated 
by generative AI, accelerating the transformation of work in occupations such as education 
and technology, for which automation potential was previously expected to emerge 
later (Exhibit 11).

Labor economists have often noted that the deployment of automation technologies tends 
to have the most impact on workers with the lowest skill levels, as measured by educational 
attainment, or what is called skill biased. We find that generative AI has the opposite pattern—
it is likely to have the most incremental impact through automating some of the activities of 
more-educated workers (Exhibit 12). 

Exhibit 12

Generative AI increases the potential for technical automation most in 
occupations requiring higher levels of educational attainment.

Another way to interpret this result is that generative AI will challenge the attainment of 
multiyear degree credentials as an indicator of skills, and others have advocated for taking 
a more skills-based approach to workforce development in order to create more equitable, 
efficient workforce training and matching systems.14 Generative AI could still be described as 
skill-biased technological change, but with a different, perhaps more granular, description of 
skills that are more likely to be replaced than complemented by the activities that machines 
can do.

Previous generations of automation technology often had the most impact on occupations 
with wages falling in the middle of the income distribution. For lower-wage occupations, 
making a case for work automation is more difficult because the potential benefits of 
automation compete against a lower cost of human labor. Additionally, some of the tasks 
performed in lower-wage occupations are technically difficult to automate—for example, 
manipulating fabric or picking delicate fruits. Some labor economists have observed a

“hollowing out of the middle,” and our previous models have suggested that work automation 
would likely have the biggest midterm impact on lower-middle-income quintiles. 

However, generative AI’s impact is likely to most transform the work of higher-wage 
knowledge workers because of advances in the technical automation potential of their 
activities, which were previously considered to be relatively immune from automation 
(Exhibit 13).

Generative AI could have the biggest impact on activities in high-wage jobs; 
previously, automation’s impact was highest in lower-middle-income quintiles.

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

Generative AI could propel higher productivity growth

Global economic growth was slower from 2012 to 2022 than in the two preceding decades.15 
Although the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant factor, long-term structural challenges—
including declining birth rates and aging populations—are ongoing obstacles to growth. 

Declining employment is among those obstacles. Compound annual growth in the total 
number of workers worldwide slowed from 2.5 percent in 1972–82 to just 0.8 percent in 
2012–22, largely because of aging. In many large countries, the size of the workforce is 
already declining.16 Productivity, which measures output relative to input, or the value of 
goods and services produced divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources 
required to produce them, was the main engine of economic growth in the three decades from 
1992 to 2022 (Exhibit 14). However, since then, productivity growth has slowed in tandem with 
slowing employment growth, confounding economists and policy makers.17

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

The deployment of generative AI and other technologies could help accelerate productivity 
growth, partially compensating for declining employment growth and enabling overall 
economic growth. Based on our estimates, the automation of individual work activities 
enabled by these technologies could provide the global economy with an annual productivity 
boost of 0.5 to 3.4 percent from 2023 to 2040 depending on the rate of automation 
adoption—with generative AI contributing to 0.1 to 0.6 percentage points of that growth—
but only if individuals affected by the technology were to shift to other work activities that 
at least match their 2022 productivity levels (Exhibit 15). In some cases, workers will stay in 
the same occupations, but their mix of activities will shift; in others, workers will need to shift 
occupations.

Generative AI could contribute to productivity growth if labor hours can 
be redeployed effectively.

technical automation. That in turn has sped up the pace at which automation may be deployed 
and expanded the types of workers who will experience its impact. Like other technologies, 
its ability to take on routine tasks and work can increase human productivity, which has grown 
at a below-average rate for almost 20 years.18 It can also offset the impact of aging, which is 
beginning to put a dent in workforce growth for many of the world’s major economies. But to 
achieve these benefits, a significant number of workers will need to substantially change the 
work they do, either in their existing occupations or in new ones. They will also need support in 
making transitions to new activities.

Considerations for 
businesses and society

History has shown that new technologies have the potential to reshape societies. Artificial 
intelligence has already changed the way we live and work—for example, it can help our 
phones (mostly) understand what we say, or draft emails. Mostly, however, AI has remained 
behind the scenes, optimizing business processes or making recommendations about the 
next product to buy. The rapid development of generative AI is likely to significantly augment 
the impact of AI overall, generating trillions of dollars of additional value each year and 
transforming the nature of work.

But the technology could also deliver new and significant challenges. Stakeholders must 
act—and quickly, given the pace at which generative AI could be adopted—to prepare to 
address both the opportunities and the risks. Risks have already surfaced, including concerns 
about the content that generative AI systems produce: Will they infringe upon intellectual 
property due to “plagiarism” in the training data used to create foundation models? Will the 
answers that LLMs produce when questioned be accurate, and can they be explained? Will 
the content generative AI creates be fair or biased in ways that users do not want by, say, 
producing content that reflects harmful stereotypes?

48

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

There are economic challenges too: the scale and the scope of the workforce transitions 
described in this report are considerable. In the midpoint adoption scenario, about a quarter 
to a third of work activities could change in the coming decade. The task before us is to 
manage the potential positives and negatives of the technology simultaneously (for more 
about the potential risks of generative AI, see Box 5). Here are some of the critical questions 
we will need to address while balancing our enthusiasm for the potential benefits of the 
technology with the new challenges it can introduce. 

Box 5
Using generative AI responsibly

Generative AI poses a variety of risks. 
Stakeholders will want to address these 
risks from the start. 

Fairness: Models may generate 
algorithmic bias due to imperfect training 
data or decisions made by the engineers 
developing the models.

Intellectual property (IP): Training 
data and model outputs can generate 
significant IP risks, including infringing 
on copyrighted, trademarked, patented, 
or otherwise legally protected materials. 
Even when using a provider’s generative 
AI tool, organizations will need to 
understand what data went into training 
and how it’s used in tool outputs.

Privacy: Privacy concerns could arise if 
users input information that later ends 
up in model outputs in a form that makes 

individuals identifiable. Generative 
AI could also be used to create and 
disseminate malicious content such as 
disinformation, deepfakes, and hate 
speech.

Security: Generative AI may be 
used by bad actors to accelerate the 
sophistication and speed of cyberattacks. 
It also can be manipulated to provide 
malicious outputs. For example, through a 
technique called prompt injection, a third 
party gives a model new instructions that 
trick the model into delivering an output 
unintended by the model producer and 
end user.

Explainability: Generative AI relies 
on neural networks with billions of 
parameters, challenging our ability 

to explain how any given answer is 
produced.

Reliability: Models can produce different 
answers to the same prompts, impeding 
the user’s ability to assess the accuracy 
and reliability of outputs.

Organizational impact: Generative AI 
may significantly affect the workforce, 
and the impact on specific groups 
and local communities could be 
disproportionately negative.

Social and environmental impact: The 
development and training of foundation 
models may lead to detrimental social and 
environmental consequences, including 
an increase in carbon emissions (for 
example, training one large language 
model can emit about 315 tons of carbon 
dioxide).1

Association for Computational Linguistics, June 5, 2019.

Companies and business leaders
How can companies move quickly to capture the potential value at stake highlighted in this 
report, while managing the risks that generative AI presents?

How will the mix of occupations and skills needed across a company’s workforce be 
transformed by generative AI and other artificial intelligence over the coming years? How will 
a company enable these transitions in its hiring plans, retraining programs, and other aspects 
of human resources?

Do companies have a role to play in ensuring the technology is not deployed in “negative use 
cases” that could harm society? 

How can businesses transparently share their experiences with scaling the use of generative 
AI within and across industries—and also with governments and society? 

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

49

Policy makers
What will the future of work look like at the level of an economy in terms of occupations and 
skills? What does this mean for workforce planning?

How can workers be supported as their activities shift over time? What retraining programs 
can be put in place? What incentives are needed to support private companies as they invest 
in human capital? Are there earn-while-you-learn programs such as apprenticeships that 
could enable people to retrain while continuing to support themselves and their families?

What steps can policy makers take to prevent generative AI from being used in ways that 
harm society or vulnerable populations? 

Can new policies be developed and existing policies amended to ensure human-centric AI 
development and deployment that includes human oversight and diverse perspectives and 
accounts for societal values? 

Individuals as workers, consumers, and citizens
How concerned should individuals be about the advent of generative AI? While companies 
can assess how the technology will affect their bottom lines, where can citizens turn for 
accurate, unbiased information about how it will affect their lives and livelihoods? 

How can individuals as workers and consumers balance the conveniences generative AI 
delivers with its impact in their workplaces? 

Can citizens have a voice in the decisions that will shape the deployment and integration of 
generative AI into the fabric of their lives? 

Technological innovation can inspire equal parts awe and concern. When that innovation 
seems to materialize fully formed and becomes widespread seemingly overnight, both 
responses can be amplified. The arrival of generative AI in the fall of 2022 was the most 
recent example of this phenomenon, due to its unexpectedly rapid adoption as well as the 
ensuing scramble among companies and consumers to deploy, integrate, and play with it. 

All of us are at the beginning of a journey to understand this technology’s power, reach, 
and capabilities. If the past eight months are any guide, the next several years will take us 
on a roller-coaster ride featuring fast-paced innovation and technological breakthroughs 
that force us to recalibrate our understanding of AI’s impact on our work and our lives. It is 
important to properly understand this phenomenon and anticipate its impact. Given the speed 
of generative AI’s deployment so far, the need to accelerate digital transformation and reskill 
labor forces is great. 

These tools have the potential to create enormous value for the global economy at a time 
when it is pondering the huge costs of adapting and mitigating climate change. At the same 
time, they also have the potential to be more destabilizing than previous generations of 
artificial intelligence. They are capable of that most human of abilities, language, which is a 
fundamental requirement of most work activities linked to expertise and knowledge as well as 
a skill that can be used to hurt feelings, create misunderstandings, obscure truth, and incite 
violence and even wars. 

We hope this research has contributed to a better understanding of generative AI’s capacity 
to add value to company operations and fuel economic growth and prosperity as well as its 
potential to dramatically transform how we work and our purpose in society. Companies, 
policy makers, consumers, and citizens can work together to ensure that generative AI 
delivers on its promise to create significant value while limiting its potential to upset lives and 
livelihoods. The time to act is now.19

I. Scope of the investment landscape

For data on investment flows into generative AI, we relied on Pitchbook. 

For data on investments in artificial intelligence overall, we referred to The AI Index 2023 
annual report by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered AI.1 

II. How we sized the use case value potential 

Overall objective
The objective was to estimate the potential economic impact of generative AI and foundation 
models using a bottom-up assessment of the most relevant use cases across business 
functions and industries. The resulting analysis approximates the potential value of generative 
AI and foundation models in terms of productivity, or the equivalent amount by which the 
technologies could reduce the global functional spending required to maintain current 
revenue levels. 

Summary of our approach
Our micro-to-macro use-case-based approach to estimating the potential impact of 
generative AI included the following:

How we estimated the impact of generative AI across industries. We identified and cataloged 
generative AI and foundation model use cases with input from experts from McKinsey’s 
industry and functional practices. While the resulting generative AI and foundation model 
use case database is not necessarily exhaustive, it was meant to be as comprehensive as 
possible.

Finance and strategy 

Activities related to financial operations, such as general 
accounting, financial planning and analysis, and accounts 
payable and receivable, as well as internal strategy functions 
such as market intelligence and strategic planning  

Estimate generative AI’s impact in individual use cases. We collected expert inputs, the 
results of McKinsey internal experiments, and published research to estimate the potential 
quantitative range of impact (in both cost savings and revenue uplift) and to gain qualitative 
findings from functions within individual use cases.2 Where generative AI and foundation 
models are assumed to increase revenue, we recast the effect as an increase in productivity 
that would be the equivalent of the reduced level of spending required to maintain the same 
level of output (thus enabling comparability with cost reductions).

Our analysis of use cases only examines the direct impact of generative AI on productivity. 
They do not incorporate secondary benefits, such as the economic impact of hiring a more 
capable employee or hiring employees more rapidly.

Estimate the impact across industries 
To estimate the impact of generative AI and foundation models across industries, we scaled 
our analysis from a functional lens to an industry lens for each industry, assessing the weight 
of functional costs. For instance, customer operations costs are higher in the telecom 
industry than in aerospace.

For each use case, the relevant costs were defined to account only for activities for which 
generative AI or foundation models were likely to deliver productivity gains. For example, the 
cost base against which we assessed productivity gains for the marketing function excludes 
ad buying costs because the use cases we assessed for generative AI in that function would 
have no productivity impact on the “ad buying” activity.

A.  Global revenues for each industry in 2022 were sourced from IHS Markit and Oxford 

Economics.

B.  We estimated the functional cost for a function as a percentage of total revenue in an 
industry based on published data, industry experts, and McKinsey benchmarks. 

2  Generative AI at work, April 2023.

54

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

C.  For each function, we estimated the relevant costs (considering only underlying activities 
affected by our use cases) as a portion of overall spending on a function, again informed 
by published data, industry experts, and McKinsey benchmarks.

D.  For each use case, we quantified the potential impact of generative AI and foundation 
models based on the impact (either cost or revenue) as a function of the relevant 
addressable spending. 

E.  We then calculated the impact by industry by aggregating the technology’s impact on use 

cases in an industry across functions. 

Limitations of our impact analysis
For each use case, our analysis of the impact of generative AI and foundation models draws a 
conservative base case and a more accelerated upside potential. The estimates are based on 
existing data and experiences, and these estimates could be updated over time. Additionally, 
the list of use cases is not exhaustive but is as comprehensive as possible, given our methods.

The estimates in this report should be treated as directional rather than precise, given the 
nature of the technology and the wide range of uncertainty involved in the future development 
of generative AI. We welcome challenges to our analysis as well as additional inputs that 
would refine and enhance it. 

Comparison with the 2018 report Notes from the AI frontier: 
Applications and value of deep learning
To estimate the incremental impact that generative AI and foundation models could have 
in comparison to the value of artificial intelligence overall, we updated our 2018 estimates 
of the value that could be created through deployment of advanced analytics and previous 
generations of artificial intelligence.3

This research incorporates 2022 updates to baseline financial variables such as industry 
revenues, enabling updates to the total potential economic impact of advanced analytics and 
AI exclusive of generative AI and foundation models. 

III. How we estimated the impact of generative AI 
on the potential for technical automation

This report continues and adapts the methodology and findings of the January 2017 
McKinsey Global Institute report, A future that works: Automation, employment, and 
productivity.4 We recommend that readers refer to the technical appendix of that report 
for our full methodology. Here, we outline updates we have incorporated in the automation 
adoption estimation process and a brief overview of the steps involved in assessing 
automation adoption, together with methodology to estimate the impact of automation on 
work hours (represented as full-time equivalents, or FTEs, where one FTE equals 2,080 
hours) and GDP impact. (For additional research on the impact of automation on work 
transformation, please see Box A1, “Overview of select recent studies on the impact of

Approach 
summary

• Estimate the share of total work exposed to labor-saving automation by AI by occupation and industry.
• Thirteen work activities are classified as exposed to AI automation based on a review on the probable use 
cases of Generative AI, and a share of each occupation's total workload that AI has the potential to replace 
is estimated by applying the O*Net “level” scale and taking an importance- and complexity-weighted 
average of essential work tasks. 

Data collection

• O*NET and European ESCO databases were used to obtain information about task contents and occupations.

Key relevant 
findings

• In the United States and Europe, two-thirds of jobs are being exposed to some degree of AI automation; 
25 percent of current work tasks could be automated. Extrapolating globally, 18 percent of work could 
be automated by AI, with scenarios ranging from 15 to 35 percent, depending on different levels of AI 
capabilities.

• Seven percent of US employment would be substituted by AI, and 300 million jobs globally would 

be exposed to automation, assuming jobs for which at least 50 percent of importance- and 
complexity-weighted tasks are exposed to automation are likely to be substituted by AI, 10 to 49 percent 
are likely to be complemented, and less than 10 percent are unlikely to be affected.

• Generative AI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a ten-year 
period, assuming that 7 percent of workers are fully displaced but able to find employment at slightly 
less productive positions, that partially exposed workers increase their productivity, and that roughly 
half of firms adopt generative AI during that period. Scenarios of productivity growth range from 0.3 to 
3.0 percentage points depending on the difficulty level of tasks generative AI could perform, how many 
jobs are automated, and the speed of adoption.

• Extrapolating globally, annual productivity growth from generative AI could be 1.4 percentage points over 

ten years.

Approach 
summary

• Investigate implications of large language models (LLMs) on the United States labor market using three 
exposure categories (exposure being a measure of whether access to an LLM would reduce the time 
required to complete a specific detailed work activity or task by at least 50 percent): 1 is no exposure, 2 
is direct exposure, and 3 is LLM+ exposure (that is, additional software could be developed on top of the 
LLM) to reach 50 percent.

• Exposure was assessed by human annotators and GPT-4.

Data collection

• The working paper used the O*NET database (1,016 occupations, 2,087 detailed work activities [DWA], and 

19,265 tasks). DWAs were first aggregated to task level then occupation level.

• Employment and wage data were obtained from the 2020 and 2021 occupational employment series 

provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Key relevant 
findings

• About 80 percent of the US workforce could have at least 10 percent of their work tasks exposed to LLMs 

(the time required to complete these tasks reduced by at least 50 percent).

• Nineteen percent of workers may see at least 50 percent of their tasks exposed to LLMs.
• About 15 percent of all worker tasks in the United States could be performed significantly faster at the 

same level of quality with LLMs, but this share increases to 47 to 56 percent when incorporating software 
and tooling built on top of LLMs.

• Effects of LLMs are relevant to all wage levels, but high-income occupations and occupations requiring at 

least a bachelor’s degree may be more exposed than others.

Approach 

summary

• Estimate the share of total work exposed to labor-saving automation by AI by occupation and industry.

• Thirteen work activities are classified as exposed to AI automation based on a review on the probable use 

cases of Generative AI, and a share of each occupation's total workload that AI has the potential to replace 

is estimated by applying the O*Net “level” scale and taking an importance- and complexity-weighted 

average of essential work tasks. 

Data collection

• O*NET and European ESCO databases were used to obtain information about task contents and occupations.

Key relevant 

findings

• In the United States and Europe, two-thirds of jobs are being exposed to some degree of AI automation; 

25 percent of current work tasks could be automated. Extrapolating globally, 18 percent of work could 

be automated by AI, with scenarios ranging from 15 to 35 percent, depending on different levels of AI 

capabilities.

• Seven percent of US employment would be substituted by AI, and 300 million jobs globally would 

be exposed to automation, assuming jobs for which at least 50 percent of importance- and 

complexity-weighted tasks are exposed to automation are likely to be substituted by AI, 10 to 49 percent 

are likely to be complemented, and less than 10 percent are unlikely to be affected.

• Generative AI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a ten-year 

period, assuming that 7 percent of workers are fully displaced but able to find employment at slightly 

less productive positions, that partially exposed workers increase their productivity, and that roughly 

half of firms adopt generative AI during that period. Scenarios of productivity growth range from 0.3 to 

3.0 percentage points depending on the difficulty level of tasks generative AI could perform, how many 

jobs are automated, and the speed of adoption.

• Extrapolating globally, annual productivity growth from generative AI could be 1.4 percentage points over 

ten years.

Approach 

summary

• Investigate implications of large language models (LLMs) on the United States labor market using three 

exposure categories (exposure being a measure of whether access to an LLM would reduce the time 

required to complete a specific detailed work activity or task by at least 50 percent): 1 is no exposure, 2 

is direct exposure, and 3 is LLM+ exposure (that is, additional software could be developed on top of the 

LLM) to reach 50 percent.

• Exposure was assessed by human annotators and GPT-4.

Data collection

• The working paper used the O*NET database (1,016 occupations, 2,087 detailed work activities [DWA], and 

19,265 tasks). DWAs were first aggregated to task level then occupation level.

• Employment and wage data were obtained from the 2020 and 2021 occupational employment series 

provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Key relevant 
findings

Box A1 (continued)

• About 80 percent of the US workforce could have at least 10 percent of their work tasks exposed to LLMs 

(the time required to complete these tasks reduced by at least 50 percent).

• Nineteen percent of workers may see at least 50 percent of their tasks exposed to LLMs.
• About 15 percent of all worker tasks in the United States could be performed significantly faster at the 

same level of quality with LLMs, but this share increases to 47 to 56 percent when incorporating software 
and tooling built on top of LLMs.

• Effects of LLMs are relevant to all wage levels, but high-income occupations and occupations requiring at 

least a bachelor’s degree may be more exposed than others.

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

We assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through an 
analysis of the component activities of each occupation. Our analysis covers 47 countries 
representing more than 80 percent of the global economy. We used the US Bureau of Labor 
Statistics O*Net data set that maps about 850 occupations to approximately 2,100 detailed 
work activities.

Each detailed work activity was assessed against 18 capabilities that could potentially be 
automated based on the level of performance necessary to successfully perform that activity. 
These assessments were informed by academic research, McKinsey expertise, and industry 
experts. We defined four possible levels of requirement for each capability, ranging from 
not required to top-quartile human performance. Please refer to exhibits A1 to A4 of the 
technical appendix in the January 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report, A future that works: 
Automation, employment, and productivity for more details on the capabilities and the four 
requirement levels.5

Assigning the required level of capabilities to activities
We used a machine learning algorithm to score the approximately 2,100 work activities 
in relation to the 18 performance capabilities. To train the algorithm, we devised a list of 
keywords with input from experts. The algorithm scores each activity by matching keywords 
from the capability to the activity title. These assessments were checked manually, and where 
we found anomalies, special requirements, or a need for nuance, we made adjustments—for 
example, in assessing the level of capabilities needed to navigate in extreme weather or 
on uneven surfaces and other unpredictable settings, or the different physical capabilities 
required by a kindergarten teacher compared with a middle school teacher.

1. Modeling of automation adoption timelines
Our adoption model assesses the automation development and adoption timeline at activity 
level for more than 850 occupations across 19 sectors and 47 countries that represent more 
than 80 percent of the global economy. We divide the adoption process into four phases: 
technical feasibility, solution development, economic feasibility, and end-user adoption.

Technical feasibility
For a detailed work activity to be automated, technology must exist that performs at the 
required level for each of the 18 capabilities. To update the progression scenarios for the 
performance capabilities over time, we surveyed experts in generative AI. We also conducted 
interviews with industry leaders and academic experts. Based on these assessments, we 
updated the expected time frames to reach each level of performance for each capability. In 
our analysis and interaction with experts, we focused on the following capabilities that could 
be affected by generative AI:  

 — Natural-language understanding

 — Natural-language generation

 — Social and emotional reasoning

 — Emotional and social output

 — Social and emotional sensing

 — Coordination with multiple agents

 — Generating novel patterns or categories

 — Creativity

 — Logical reasoning and problem solving

 — Output articulation or display

 — Sensory perception

Solution development
We also updated our estimates for how long it would take to develop a solution that could 
integrate automation technologies once technical feasibility was established, based on 
a series of expert interviews. The original estimates were developed by examining the 
development time and technical capabilities for more than 100 previously developed 
automation solutions, including hardware and software solutions. 

Economic feasibility
Once a solution is developed, we assume activities will start to be automated when the cost 
of the solution falls below the level of wages paid to a human to do that activity. For this 
calculation, we accounted for the evolution of solution costs as well as the evolution of wages.

Solution cost evolution
Based on the capability requirements, solutions are classified into two categories: hardware 
and software. If a solution requires sensory perception, fine motor skills and dexterity, gross 
motor skills, or mobility, it is classified as a hardware solution. Otherwise, it is classified as 
a software solution. For a given solution, the initial cost is estimated as a percentage of the 
highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity across all the countries we modeled. 
We estimated the initial cost by examining several examples of solutions developed using 
different mixes of hardware and software. Based on our research, most software solutions 
have relatively low initial costs as a percentage of the human labor cost. Some solutions that 
require a combination of both software and hardware components have a higher initial cost. 
To be conservative, we excluded certain solutions with advantages that could be derived only 
from very specific scenarios or that include noneconomic benefits such as increased quality 
and efficiency or decreased error rates. The range of initial solution costs we modeled is 20 
to 70 percent of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity for hardware, and 0 to 
20 percent for software.

In our model, solution costs decrease as technology advances. Hardware solution costs 
decline by 16.0 percent per year, and software solution costs decline by 5.3 percent per year. 
We triangulate the consumer price index and supplier surveys to estimate the reduction in 
hardware solution costs. For this, we use computer software and accessories indexes to 
estimate software solution cost reduction. For consumer price inflation, we used consumer 
price index data for personal computers and peripheral equipment. For computer software 
and accessories, we use data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. For software solution 
costs, we use a survey of prices from the International Federation of Robotics. Further work 
could be done to refine the estimation; however, given software’s low starting cost, annual 
reductions have little impact on final automation results.

Wage evolution
We model the wage evolution for each country in two stages. From 2023 to 2030, we apply 
country-level growth estimates for all countries and convert them into 2010 constant US 
dollars by dividing nominal GDP by the corresponding country-level price deflator (2010 
base) and multiply the exchange rate to the dollar (2010 base). We then calculate a CAGR for 
each country from 2022 to 2030. For 2030 onward, we grouped the 47 countries for which 
we have data into two cohorts using a cutoff country-level annual wage, based on the wage 
distribution from 2022 to 2030. Countries within the same cohort grow at the same rate. We 
reclassify countries each year. As a country advances into the next cohort, the appropriate 
growth rate is applied.

Adoption and deployment
Adoption can start once automation solutions are economically feasible, but several factors 
can hinder or enable the timing and the pace of adoption. Solutions requiring different 
technologies have varying levels of ease of integration. It takes time to integrate capabilities 
into current technical platforms and combine them into an organic entity. Barriers also exist 
on the organization side. Human talent and organization structures might act as bottlenecks 
to implementation. Policies and regulations could also slow down or accelerate technology 
innovation and adoption. Finally, depending on their preferences, consumers might have 
varied levels of acceptance for automated solutions that could affect the pace of adoption.

To incorporate all these factors, we used the mathematics of the Bass diffusion model, a well-
known and widely used function in forecasting, especially for new product sales forecasting 
and technology forecasting.

F(t) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of given technology or product) and f(t) is 
the corresponding rate of change.

The function in our case also contains two key parameters: p parameter (the inherent 
tendency of consumers to adopt new technology), and q parameter (the tendency of 
consumers to adopt based on peer adoption). Parameters are estimated through ordinary 
least square regression. In the absence of data, p and q parameter values from meta analyses 
can be used if a saturation value is known or can be guessed.

We then simulated two scenarios for historic technology adoption curves. The technologies 
we used are stents, airbags, laparoscopic surgery, MRI, smartphones, TVs, antilock braking 
systems, online air booking, cellphones, color TVs, SX/EW leaching, personal computers, 
electronic stability control, instrument landing systems, dishwashers, and pacemakers. The 
fitted values of parameters p and q are consistent with other academic research. It takes 
about five years to reach 50 percent adoption in the earliest scenario and approximately 16 
years in the latest scenario. 

2. Work hours that could be automated
The impact of automation on work hours across different capability levels is estimated below 
for the technical automation potential and automation adoption:

Impact by occupation by scenario: Number of FTEs X % automation estimate by scenario

Impact by activity: Number of FTEs X time spent on activity per year6 X percent automation 
estimate by scenario 

Impact by occupation group7 : Σoccupation (Number of FTEs X percent automation estimate by 
scenario)

3. Impact of automation on productivity
We used GDP per FTE as the measure of productivity. We calculated automation output 
under different scenarios by multiplying the projected number of FTEs by the estimated 
automation adoption rate. To maintain consistency with other data sources, we made several 
additional assumptions. We considered only job activities that are available and well defined 
as of the date of this report. Also, to be conservative, we assumed that automation has a labor

substitution effect but no other performance gains. Finally, we assumed that labor replaced 
by automation will rejoin the workforce at the same level of productivity as today. We also 
assumed that additional output from automation will not decrease, even if the total number of 
FTEs declines as a result of demographic changes. 

Under the assumptions outlined above, we calculated the GDP impact of automation adoption 
by country as follows:

Additional GDP impact of automation = FTE impact of automation X productivity  

The additional GDP impact of automation is then added to 2022 GDP to estimate the 
productivity impact of automation.
