Uniquely Austin: 
Stewarding growth in 
America’s boomtown

April 2023

Preface

McKinsey formally opened its Austin office in May 2022. Like many others, McKinsey is 
thrilled by what Austin has achieved in recent decades and even more excited about the city’s 
future. The firm’s ambition—as with everywhere McKinsey operates—is to become a valued 
member of this vibrant community and for the firm’s people and their collective knowledge to 
bring positive, enduring change to the region. This report was crafted with that in mind.

The objective of this report is to provide a fact-based, nonpartisan perspective on Greater 
Austin’s growth and to galvanize the conversation about how the Austin community can 
steward growth that is both sustainable and inclusive. Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth 
in America’s boomtown was not sponsored or commissioned by any institution and is based 
on rigorous analysis, insights from McKinsey experts, and interviews with more than 100 of 
Greater Austin’s senior business and civic leaders, including CEOs, university leaders, policy 
makers, artists, religious leaders, entrepreneurs, educators, and first responders. Their level 
of engagement was inspiring, and their diversity of perspectives and ideas helped shape our 
thinking. We are so grateful for the time they spent with us and thank them and our colleagues 
for their contributions.

Greater Austin is truly one of a kind, and this report celebrates just some of its attributes and 
why we believe it is uniquely positioned for continued growth. However, Uniquely Austin: 
Stewarding growth in America’s boomtown also underscores the real work that must be 
done to responsibly balance that growth while managing through the challenges we see on 
the horizon.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownExecutive summary

By any traditional measure, Austin is thriving. The city is today the 11th largest in the United 
States, fueled by an influx of people and businesses that has made Greater Austin one 
of the fastest-growing regions in the country. Since 2010, the GDP of the Greater Austin 
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) has nearly doubled,1 and its population has grown by 
36 percent, or the highest growth of any major metropolitan area in the country.2

The region is also a hotbed of idea generation. Abundant talent emerges from a higher-
education system of more than 160,000 students in Greater Austin—anchored by 
the University of Texas—and entrepreneurs and venture capitalists welcome both the ease 
of doing business and the area’s collaborative culture.3 The result is a thriving business 
ecosystem: Greater Austin is the headquarters or founding location of more than 20 
unicorns—privately held startup companies with a value of more than $1 billion—and venture 
capital investments in the region have increased fivefold since 2016.4 Many ideas once 
considered outlandish were born in Austin, from selling computers directly to consumers 
(Dell) to starting a grocery store chain devoted to selling organic food (Whole Foods).

But growing pains have accompanied this ascendance. Challenges that previously affected 
Austin alone are now being felt at the regional level. Many residents struggle with Greater 
Austin’s changing identity, and significant challenges persist around everything from 
infrastructure to affordability and inclusivity. We believe these issues, which are common for 
growing metropolises, are surmountable: Greater Austin remains early enough in its evolution 
to change these trajectories and preserve its unique culture while making the region a pioneer 
of sustainable, inclusive growth and a frontier for cutting-edge science and technology.

The speed and scale necessary 
to relieve Austin’s growing 
pains can be achieved only by 
bold leaders, visionaries, and 
policy makers acting together.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownComing together to lead the way

We are not suggesting it will be easy: the speed and scale necessary to relieve Austin’s 
growing pains can be achieved only by bold leaders, visionaries, and policy makers acting 
together to conceive and enact innovative solutions—not just for the city of Austin but also 
for the Greater Austin region. But while it may require previously unrivaled commitment, scale, 
and cooperation, we know regional leaders are up to the challenge. By taking a nonpartisan 
and fact-based approach, this community of leaders can amplify existing effective work while 
galvanizing the broader community to address the region’s tangible problems and set goals 
for overcoming them.

To understand the state of the Greater Austin area, the scope of its challenges, and 
potential interventions, we met separately with 100 community leaders within Central Texas, 
including CEOs, policy makers, heads of not-for-profits, artists, and religious leaders. There 
was remarkable consensus in their responses: more than 90 percent said affordability 
was Greater Austin’s top challenge, followed by infrastructure and inclusivity (Exhibit E1). 
The same percentage of community leaders pointed to the need to act now.

as new residents have flocked to Greater Austin. Housing is in short supply, especially in 
Travis County, and the average home price in the Austin MSA has rocketed 170 percent since 
2010—almost double the national average.5 Other costs, including transportation, healthcare, 
food, and childcare, have risen faster than housing prices in the Greater Austin MSA. One 
result has been a shift in the region’s population center as people move farther from the urban 
core to more-affordable suburbs (Exhibit E2). 

As a result of this expansion and displacement, Austin has the second-highest congestion 
costs per commuter among all midsize US cities, and the situation is getting worse. As more 
people commute longer distances, the region’s infrastructure is proving it is not up to the task 
of continued growth.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownStewarding sustainable, inclusive growth

To counteract these effects and steward Greater Austin’s future, leaders will need to come 
together and focus on three mutually beneficial elements: growth, sustainability, and 
inclusivity. These elements can work in tandem to drive the region’s future, but reaching that 
sweet spot will require action across six strategic pillars: economic development and business 
climate; a talented workforce; affordability; diversity, equity, and inclusion; infrastructure; and 
environmental sustainability. 

We believe stewarding sustainable and inclusive growth is a core responsibility of leaders in 
the community—including McKinsey. We hope this report sparks conversation, collaboration, 
and tangible action benefiting both our community and local businesses. After all, if one thing 
brings Austinites together, it is genuine care for the future of both the city and the region.

Introduction

Uniquely Austin: An 
evolution to celebrate

The region has become well known as one of the country’s most 
dynamic and appealing places to live or visit. Is it possible to 
make great even greater?

The sustained growth streak of the Greater Austin metropolitan statistical area (MSA) has 
combined a flourishing economy (real GDP nearly doubled between 2010 and 20221) with 
a high level of population growth (36 percent between 2010 and 20212) unrivaled among 
the 50 largest MSAs in the United States. Even through the pandemic, Austin remained 
the country’s standard bearer, adding almost 100,000 jobs as its economy grew by 
8.6 percent.3 While the city may not be as “weird” as it once was,4 it is firmly regarded as one of 
the country’s most appealing, dynamic, and desirable places to live and work.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownWhile the region has undoubtedly changed, it retains a certain energy, brimming with opportunity 
and potential. The city sports a renowned music scene, premier higher-education institutions, 
an entrepreneurial yet welcoming and collaborative spirit, and access to captivating outdoor 
spaces; new and longtime residents alike take pride in this unique combination of features. 
There’s just something about Austin. When asked to describe Austin’s allure, one local start-up 
founder said: “Austin is a place of gathering. I think it’s awesome so many people want to come 
here—there are obvious reasons to, after all.” From South by Southwest (SXSW) to Formula One, 
Austin has an undeniable national profile. But at the end of the day, Austinites simply want what’s 
best for their home. Why? One local not-for-profit (NPO) leader echoed the sentiment of many: “[It 
is] absolutely my favorite city in the world. There is truly no place like it.”

A gradual ascendancy, achieved suddenly

Not long ago, it seemed the only jobs to be found in Austin were in government or higher 
education. But the private sector has been the most pronounced driver of recent economic 
growth, and total private employment has grown four times as fast as government employment 
(Exhibit 1).5 Today’s business landscape features a unique mix of unicorns, venture capital and 
private equity, home-grown midcap companies, relocated technology giants, and new satellite 
offices of trillion-dollar companies.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownThis recent boom did not happen overnight. Austin was on the fast track well before 
the headline-grabbing news of Oracle and Tesla relocating their headquarters to the city in 
2020 and 2021, respectively, put its ascendancy on the map. From 2010 to 2020, the GDP 
of the Austin MSA was nearly three times the national average and two times the average 
of comparable “high growth” MSAs.6 One factor behind the MSA’s seemingly sudden rise to 
prominence is its growth since the onset of the pandemic—GDP rocketed 20 percent from 
2020 to 2022. That is not expected to slow: by 2029, Austin’s three largest sectors by GDP 
(real estate, professional services, and information) are each projected to grow by more than 
5.8 percent annually.7

Keys to creating an inclusive, sustainable future

We’ve identified five principal challenges that, if addressed, can provide a path for Greater 
Austin to steward tomorrow’s growth. The balance of this report examines these in turn, from 
growing homelessness to infrastructure issues and the rising cost of doing business or simply 
living here. Assuming current migration rates continue, Greater Austin’s total population will 
nearly double to 4.4 million residents by 2050, and there could be significant consequences 
if this challenge is not managed with dynamic, innovative actions that reflect the best 
of the city.8 Austin cannot let the quest for a “magic bullet” to solve these issues impede 
the incremental progress and mitigation needed to prevent challenges from becoming crises. 

But what does it mean for Greater Austin to grow inclusively and sustainably?9

By growth, we mean increased prosperity and well-being, including profitable growth for 
the region’s private sector and GDP growth across the region. We also mean measures such 
as job opportunity for citizens, derived in part from dignity of work (while recognizing that 
measurable definitions of well-being are still evolving). For inclusion, we consider equality 
of opportunity and broad-based progress of outcomes for all—especially sufficiency of 
living standards—and the narrowing of inequalities among genders, ages, ethnicities, 
family backgrounds, and places of residence. And for sustainability, we aim for sustained 
growth—including infrastructure to support economic growth—and environmental resilience. 
The latter starts with reducing climate risk but also includes emissions goals and broader 
preservation of natural capital as well as intergenerational fairness, all considered in terms of 
economic and societal costs and benefit.

As we wrote in an earlier article, “The three elements of growth, inclusion, and sustainability 
are deeply connected and cannot be viewed as trade-offs.”10 These elements are important 
because overall economic growth strengthens all aspects of the economy,11 encouraging 
capital investment, which in turn spurs productivity, wages, and growth. Greater inclusion 
means that more people—most notably the most vulnerable—share in increased economic 
outcomes and life satisfaction while growth is promoted through new demand and 
investment opportunities. And sustainability enables continued increases in both inclusion 
and growth while lowering the cost of energy, which, in turn, increases both accessibility 
and productivity.12

and religious leaders, first responders, and artists—independently confirm five challenges 
to driving a growing, inclusive, and sustainable future for Austin (Exhibit 2). The region has 
a unique opportunity to act as the standard bearer for managing growth in a sustainable and 
inclusive manner, but addressing each factor will require real action.

521611111037423Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownDefining Greater Austin 

We define Greater Austin as the Austin MSA, which includes, in order of population, Travis, 
Williamson, Hays, Bastrop, and Caldwell Counties. We have benchmarked Greater Austin 
against nine US MSAs—“high growth peers” selected for their similarity in terms of population 
and recent economic growth—as well as against Texas’s five largest MSAs to measure 
Austin’s baseline sustainability, inclusivity, and growth metrics. These peers will be discussed 
at length throughout this report; top-line analyses reinforce that Austin’s recent growth 
presents a unique opportunity (Exhibit 3). 

It is important to consider one final factor related to Greater Austin’s ability to address 
its challenges and forge growth that is both sustainable and inclusive: Austin is a liberal 
stronghold in a conservative state; as former governor Rick Perry put it, “Austin is kind 
of the blueberry in the tomato soup of the state.”13 In our interviews, local business and 
community leaders repeatedly cited political divisiveness as a challenge for the region’s 
future, especially when it comes to cross-jurisdiction, regional collaboration, and talent 
attraction and retention. Friction between political ideologies was not seen as inherently 
bad; the problems leaders cited were the inability to bridge divides across political lines 
and the potential for talent acquisition and retention to be negatively affected by policies 
emanating from both the Austin City Council and the Texas Legislature.

We’ve identified five principal 
challenges that, if addressed, 
can provide a path for 
Greater Austin to steward 
tomorrow’s growth.

Economic development 
and business climate: 
Becoming an economic 
powerhouse

Greater Austin has led peers in nearly every growth metric, but 
there is still room for improvement if it is to cultivate success for 
a diverse mix of industries and companies.

Austin’s economic growth has been a boon to local business. But it is something to celebrate 
for Austinites too: job growth totaled nearly 17 percent from 2016 to 2021, outpacing Austin’s 
population growth by nearly 3 percent and the job growth of all peers (Exhibit 4). This section 
examines what has been driving Austin’s economic growth—and what the community can 
do to ensure it continues—by looking at the city’s strong investment community, educational 
institutions, and talented workforce.

Austin is a place of idea generation. The city’s academic research and development spending 
per capita is the highest in Texas, and Greater Austin generates the most patents per capita 
of all peers (and nearly three times that of Texas cities Houston and Dallas).14 These ideas have 
often been profitable: Austin leads all peers as the headquarters or foundation location for 
more than 20 unicorns (privately financed companies valued at more than $1 billion).15 Many 
ideas once dismissed out of hand were born in Austin and have become household names, from 
selling computers directly to consumers (Dell) to selling organic groceries (Whole Foods). One 
local private-sector leader described Austin’s idea generation scene as one in which “individuals 
are enthusiastic to get together, share notes over a coffee, and help each other where they can.”

This ethos has not been lost on the investment community. Austin’s attractiveness as a venture 
capital (VC) destination has climbed steeply since 2016, with annual VC invested growing 
fivefold (Exhibit 5). In fact, the $11.6 billion in VC invested in Austin-area companies between 
2019 and 2021 topped investment in all other major Texas cities combined. On a national scale, 
Austin ranks seventh among the top ten metropolitan areas for investment dollars per person.16

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownThis is not to suggest Austin is now a VC destination on par with the likes of the Bay Area 
(where $230 billion was invested from 2019 to 2021) or even Boston ($64 billion).17 But 
these investment hubs hold valuable lessons that Greater Austin can learn from to continue 
fostering its recent growth—spanning the cycle from inception to commercialization—and 
build a more robust ecosystem.

Driving VC investment: Lessons from Boston 
The Greater Boston area has emerged as the country’s third-largest hub for VC investment, 
with a total of $33.2 billion invested in 2021 alone. This success is linked to Massachusetts’s 
renowned healthcare innovation ecosystem; as a city, Boston received $2.3 billion in National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) funding—the second highest in the nation.  

 — Fostering talent to build a research and development community. A network of research 
institutions and strong links between universities and business allow effective allocation 
of research spending and a commercialization funnel for fledgling businesses. Coupling 
this network with large anchor companies forms an ecosystem that is conducive for 
both business launches and scale-ups. Boston’s concentration of biotechnology and 
IT companies centered around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been 
described as the “most innovative square mile on the planet.”18 There are already 53 
accelerators and incubators in Austin (compared with 63 in Boston),19 and the city can 
continue to prioritize this effort with a particular focus on underserved sectors and 
minority entrepreneurs. The University of Texas’s technology transfer office has been 
an example of commercializing research. And the rising stature of the Dell Medical 
School—founded only ten years ago—gives the community a chance to expand and spark 
medtech and life sciences innovation. 

 — Scaling up existing sectors with a robust cluster-and-partner strategy. Building two or 

three sectors and technologies—as Boston has with biotechnology—is critical to driving 
strategic prioritization in the region. This approach results in a coordinated regional 
workforce strategy and distinctive branding and messaging to attract businesses, talent, 
and investors. Austin’s VC ecosystem is primarily composed of IT companies (47 percent 
of capital invested) and business-to-business (B2B) companies (27 percent).20 Building 
a “brand” for the Austin VC ecosystem can help scale Austin’s existing VC scene; it is 
easier to go from good to great than to start from scratch.

 — Attracting capital and funding. Effectively deploying both direct and indirect government 
incentives can catalyze, not crowd out, private investment in targeted industry clusters. 
Boston has invested in creating innovation districts that are accessible to entrepreneurs 
and start-ups, with capital available across the full life cycle of businesses from seed to 
exit. One Austin VC leader said the region had “a great and growing pipeline of deal flow, 
but there is still a distinct lack of late-stage capital available to local start-ups.” Prioritizing 
access to funding and development resources for entrepreneurs throughout the business 
life cycle is critical to maximizing the odds of success and fostering even greater start-
up activity.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownMaintaining a business-friendly environment

Austin was named the best place to start a business in 2020 in large part because of 
the environment of both the city and the state of Texas.21 For the region to maintain its 
attractiveness to businesses, the Greater Austin community can prioritize the following: 

 — Retaining a favorable regulatory environment. Austin and Texas have generally created 
a regulatory environment that fosters innovation. Taxes remain low for corporations, 
providing further incentive to locate in Texas. However, many leaders point to ambiguity 
about policy as a potential threat to business and talent acquisition, with one saying 
the business community “really is not sure what [politics] will do next.” Retaining these 
advantages and leading from the front in regulations that support innovation and 
economic growth will be crucial to maintaining the results already seen in the city.

 — Lowering the cost of doing business and developing business infrastructure. Despite 
relatively low taxes, the combination of high labor, office, and energy costs makes 
the overall cost of doing business in Austin the highest among its high-growth peers.22 
One local real estate leader said, “Our high office space costs come down to a supply-
and-demand issue at the end of the day. When businesses move here, they need office 
space, but we just don’t have enough room for them yet. Streamlining the development 
process for additional office space, especially in lower-cost areas, could be a real unlock.” 

 — Offering incentives for increased corporate citizenship. Austin is attracting new 

businesses that were founded somewhere else. If Austin is to remain an attractive place 
to do business—rather than just a place to harvest talent, benefit from the local brand, 
or merely take a step on the corporate ladder before heading back to an out-of-town 
headquarters—it is important that new companies and their employees feel invited and 
are provided the avenues to become active members of the community. Community 
leaders could do more to involve companies and create partnerships that are mutually 
beneficial for civic and corporate interests, particularly with some of the large satellite 
offices of companies headquartered elsewhere. 

There is no shortage of organizations for companies to partner with. Greater Austin has 
the most NPOs per capita in Texas and the second most among its national peer cities—a 
total of more than 13,500 organizations.23 Yet many of our interviewees said there is 
an overabundance of local NPOs, which limits the impact of philanthropic initiatives. 
One prominent local NPO leader summed it up as follows: “We have so many NPOs that 
funds and strategic thinking are being fractured to a point of being ineffective. If we 
could increase coordination across our NPOs, Austin could really unlock its philanthropic 
potential.” Another admitted that while “there is great work already going on,” the work 
is often not achieving the necessary scale to have an impact. “Even just partnerships 
between some of our organizations could have great impact without having to do 
the heavy lifting of a full merger,” she said.

Talented workforce: 
Sharpening a 
competitive edge

Greater Austin today originates, attracts, and retains the top 
talent needed to be a global leader of innovation. But both college 
graduates and tradespeople are critical to continued success.

A talented workforce has long been Austin’s secret weapon, even before the city had jobs to 
match the quality of its residents. “Your bartender would have a PhD, and you wouldn’t think 
twice,” one longtime leader said, and many point to the University of Texas (UT) as the reason 
they originally moved to Austin. Yet while its reputation as a city of the “underemployed” 
added to Austin’s quirky image, the net result of not having jobs to cater to its population 
ultimately was a brain drain.

Austin today has an opportunity to parlay its continued economic growth to foster a local 
workforce equipped to meet the future needs of the region’s economy. One local CEO said 
Greater Austin’s future needs are “more than just UT graduates. We need more tradespeople, 
more first responders, more educators, more service industry professionals … more 
everyone.” More can be done to ensure that the workers emerging from Greater Austin’s 
schools and universities are equipped to excel in local jobs, and it will require action at all 
levels from pre-K to tertiary education to develop a workforce prepared to meet the needs of 
Austin’s future economy.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownBuilding the workforce of Austin’s future

Austin’s economic growth has been fueled by the development of local talent and the influx 
of new residents. Fifty percent of adult residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher; 
the population is young compared with peers (33 percent of residents are aged 25 to 44, 
highest of all peers24); and the overall population grew faster than that of any peer MSA 
between 2016 and 2021 (Exhibit 6).25

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownRecent high levels of population growth in Austin have been driven largely by domestic 
migration. Contrary to popular belief, it is not California that is the primary source of new 
Austinites but other Texas MSAs. Indeed, Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio are the top three 
MSAs of origin, while Los Angeles is a distant fourth.26 Even with an influx of new workers, 
the region has consistently had the lowest unemployment rate and highest labor force 
participation rate among Texas MSAs, indicating new Austinites are finding jobs in the diverse 
economic landscape.27 For employers, however, this signifies there is both more competition 
for Greater Austin’s workers and less untapped capacity. This competition is accentuated for 
small businesses that do not have the capabilities to recruit out-of-town talent as their larger 
counterparts do.28

So, while top local CEOs agree that Greater Austin’s talent is a distinct competitive advantage, 
action is required to ensure that the region’s workforce can sustain and benefit from 
continued economic growth. Three actions may help build Greater Austin’s workforce of 
the future: supporting greater equity in education, leveraging higher-education institutions, 
and reskilling and retaining homegrown talent. 

Supporting greater equity in K–12 education to originate untapped talent pools
There is a divide in Greater Austin’s public-education system. The Austin Independent 
School District (AISD) serves 75,000 students—70 percent of whom are people of color—
and 52 percent of its students are classified as economically disadvantaged.29 AISD 
ranks lowest of Greater Austin’s three largest school districts in terms of average teacher 
experience and test scores; it has seen attendance drop 10 percent in the past six years; and 
it received a “Needs Help” designation despite a “B” rating by the Texas Education Agency. 
Compounding any attempt to boost AISD’s performance through increases in funding is 
the state’s recapture or “Robin Hood” plan: AISD contributed $707 million (around $10,000 
per student) in recapture payments to the State of Texas in the 2020–21 school year—the 
highest in the state and 257 percent more than the second highest contributor, Houston ISD.

By contrast, the neighboring Eanes Independent School District (EISD) is small, wealthy, 
and highly successful, with 67.0 percent White students and only 3.3 percent of students 
classified as disadvantaged.30 Around 93.0 percent of EISD graduates are considered 
college-, career-, or military-ready, compared with 84.7 percent of AISD graduates.

However, while AISD may receive the bluntest criticism of Austin’s school districts, it is 
certainly not alone. For the 2021–22 school year, the Hays Consolidated Independent School 
District (HCISD)—which serves 21,000 students in and around San Marcos, 72 percent of 
whom are people of color—had only 51 percent of its graduates ready for college, a career, or 
the military.31 In other words, Austin missed the opportunity to add 650 career-ready workers 
to its local economy—from just one school district’s graduating class. The opportunity and 
the need to tap previously overlooked and underinvested talent pools within Greater Austin 
are clear: improving talent pools starts with supporting districts like AISD and HCISD (see 
sidebar “The role community can play”).

among all states; this taxpayer-based data set excludes certain groups of people and thus does not represent the entire 
population but rather is a good indicator of migrating workers within the labor force.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownThe role community can play

Austin’s K–12 education could be more effective if the community and its business 
and civic leaders took a more active role in ensuring its success. Business leaders can 
collaborate with local school districts to align curriculum and credentials with the skills 
needed for local jobs. Leaders can help accelerate access to high-quality tutoring, 
provide citywide summer acceleration academies, and support telehealth services for 
students. Additionally, they can provide leadership training for principals and create 
a community of practice for school leaders. And making the region a great place to live 
for teachers by providing affordable housing and loan forgiveness can help attract and 
retain high-quality educators. Business and civic leaders can provide the expertise, 
funding, and cross-district collaboration necessary to make these initiatives a reality.

Leveraging higher-education institutions 
Located in the heart of Central Austin, the University of Texas at Austin is the poster child 
of Greater Austin’s higher-education landscape. It is home to more than 52,000 students; 
its football team is the highest grossing in the country (generating $162 million in revenue in 
the academic year 2021–22)32; and its graduates include celebrated local business icons and 
celebrities alike. UT Austin also boasts an 88 percent six-year graduation rate and spends 
more than $780 million annually on research and development.33

But the university is just one piece of Greater Austin’s rich educational landscape. As of 2019, 
a total of 172,000 students were enrolled in colleges within a 60-mile radius of downtown 
Austin34 at institutions ranging from Austin Community College (40,000 total students), 
Texas State University (38,000) in San Marcos, and Southwestern University (1,500) to 
minority-serving institutions St. Edward’s University (3,500), Concordia University (2,200), 
and Huston-Tillotson University (1,000).35 Collectively, these institutions have nurtured 
an innovation and talent pipeline contributing to the success of Austin’s economy and 
entrepreneurial scene.

More than 50 percent of Greater Austin’s residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 
Greater Austin produces the second-highest share of STEM graduates relative to all fields of 
study compared with its high-growth peers, trailing only Raleigh, North Carolina.36 

Yet many interviewees agreed that more can be done to leverage Greater Austin’s higher-
education landscape as a catalyst of innovation. The ongoing development of Austin’s new 
Innovation District provides an opportunity to create a collaborative vision and brand centered 
around innovation—such as Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, or Raleigh–
Durham’s Research Triangle—that capitalizes on existing momentum and leverages the full 
weight of Austin’s local higher-education institutions in a structured manner.

Such a unified brand could amplify the respective strengths of the individual institutions’ 
missions and promote the success of Austin’s higher-education sector and economy. But 
building a collaborative brand and vision will require leadership from an anchor institution. 
Given that UT Austin’s Dell Medical School is already an anchor of the growing downtown 
Innovation District, this role seems to befit Austin’s largest research university.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownReskilling and retaining homegrown talent
As companies relocate to Austin for its business climate and people move there for its culture, 
there does not appear to be a shortage of sought-after individuals or of-interest jobs. Yet 
the workforce cannot be taken for granted, especially as the skills required by Austin’s 
employers shift. One local manufacturing-sector leader said an acute lack of workers limited 
the economy’s potential, and employment data corroborates this view: demand for workers 
in the manufacturing sector exceeds supply by 1.5 times, and supply-and-demand gaps are 
also being experienced in government (2.1 demand-to-supply gap); educational services (1.6); 
accommodation and food services (1.4); and arts, entertainment, and recreation (1.4).

The same need to retain talent locally applies to transplants to Central Texas, an area that 
should not be seen as a pit stop on a career journey. Greater Austin can promote the retention 
of transplanted employees by supporting community-building efforts, particularly for 
underserved populations, including professional mentorship, networking events, and learning 
and development opportunities. The purpose is to make Austin feel like home and improve 
talent retention in the region.

In addition, many of Austin’s existing workers are at risk of being left behind. Reskilling 
and upskilling these workers is critical to both individual outcomes and the success of 
Austin-based companies. While Austin has strong college attainment rates, the importance 
of traditional noncollege occupations such as mechanics, welders, and carpenters has 
grown with Austin’s population increase. After all, most entry-level positions in the industry 
with one of Austin’s biggest labor shortages—food services—do not require a college 
degree. Upskilling and training local workers to fill the supply gap in critical industries 
and roles is integral to Austin’s ability to sustain economic growth (see sidebar “Rework 
America Alliance”).

Rework America Alliance

The Rework America Alliance is a nationwide collaboration of employers, not-for-profits, educators, government entities, 
and public and private organizations dedicated to opening opportunities for unemployed and low-wage workers to move 
into good-quality jobs that are resilient to automation and accessible based on skills and experience rather than academic 
credentials alone.1 Completed in tandem with the Alliance, McKinsey research predicts that 13,000 jobs in good, viable 
occupations accessible to low-income workers will be created by 2025. Based on projected job growth, the top viable 
occupations include software developers and software quality assurance analysts, registered nurses, and service sales 
representatives.2 On average, these jobs would provide a $21,000 increase in annual salary for the “origin” workers and 
potentially act as a gateway to even higher-wage occupations.3

Yet reskilling Austin’s low-income workers to fill these jobs will require commitment from career seekers and employers 
alike. Significant skills gaps exist for origin workers looking to transition into the top good, viable occupations, and most 
origin workers would need upskilling for skills such as leadership, management, and proficiency with the Microsoft Office 
suite.4 Potential upskilling programs are provided by Austin Community College and other local training providers for 
13 out of the 15 good, viable occupations. Worker-serving organizations also have a role to play and can maximize their 
impact by identifying and supporting local-origin talent pools that can upskill and find job placement in their good, viable 
occupations. Change will take a community, but upskilling local-origin workers to fill good, viable occupations will be 
a boon to both residents and businesses.

2  State-by-state certification requirements are a barrier to entry for the registered nurses occupation. Filling registered nurse positions necessitates that reskilling 

also be met with state certification assistance programs.

Affordability: 
Finding solutions 
to the region’s most 
visible challenge

Greater Austin’s population influx has increased prices for all, 
with a particular impact on the lowest earners. Ensuring all 
Austinites can access housing and essential services is critical.

Austin’s high levels of population growth and rising median incomes have made the city 
increasingly unaffordable. Greater Austin’s cost of living index (117) is highest among peers 
and rose 11 percent from 2008 to 2020, outpacing cost of living growth in the likes of Los 
Angeles and Boston.37 Greater Austin has the highest median family income (MFI) among 
its Texas peers—the MFI in Greater Austin was $110,300 in 2022 (by comparison, McAllen 
is one of the poorest MSAs in the country, and its 2022 MFI was $52,000). But the region’s 
increasing unaffordability directly affects Austin’s workforce (many teachers and first 
responders don’t earn enough to afford housing near downtown jobs), culture (low-income 

37  Cost of living, Metropolitan Statistical Area, Moody’s Analytics, accessed December 14, 2022.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownearners in the arts), and diversity (minority populations). “It’s no secret it’s becoming harder for 
us to recruit talent—even with some higher-paying jobs,” one local business leader said.

While housing is the highest monthly expenditure for Austin families,38 it isn’t the only expense 
that’s putting a burden on Austinites. A range of essentials have become more expensive 
for Austin families at rates beyond the rest of the state, except for transportation (Exhibit 7). 
The net result? The average annual earnings a family of four needs to make in order to be self-
sufficient in Greater Austin has increased from around $50,900 per year in 2018 to $66,700 
in 2021, a period in which the cost of childcare rose 47 percent and healthcare 57 percent.39 
And while the region has slightly lower income inequality compared with the average of its 
high-growth peers, 29 percent of households make less than $50,000, well below the 2021 
self-sufficiency wage.40

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownMaking housing more affordable

About 91 percent of interviewees pointed to affordability, particularly housing affordability, 
as the most pressing issue facing Greater Austin today. The driver is demand: the Austin 
MSA leads all peers in the relative share of new residents to total population, and population 
growth in suburban counties is up to three times higher than in Travis County during the past 
three years.

While housing volume and number of new builds have increased in response to this 
discrepancy (Austin leads all peers in new residential units per capita), it has not been 
enough—median home valuations rose nearly 70 percent in some of the best school districts 
from 2021 to 2022 and 54 percent on average year over year to a median of $632,000.41 
Housing is unaffordable to many Austinites: 48 percent of renters in 2021 were cost-
burdened (spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities).42

While housing affordability has affected all Austinites, it has hit the vulnerable populations of 
Travis County the hardest. For instance, there are only 22 affordable and available housing 
units for every 100 families classified as extremely low income in Greater Austin, and just 
0.9 percent of the new housing units built since 2018 in the City of Austin are affordable to 
extremely low-income families (who represent 17 percent of Austin’s population).43 In 2018, 
the City of Austin set an ambitious goal to produce 20,000 affordable units for extremely 
low-income families within ten years—but in four years, only 295 affordable units have 
been added, or just 4 percent of the prorated target.44 Greater Austin faces the ninth-worst 
housing shortage for extremely low-income households, though many peers such as Las 
Vegas, Orlando, Houston, and Dallas are facing similar issues. Lessons can be learned from 
the experiences of other cities across the country, including Los Angeles (LA).45

Learning from Los Angeles
LA is struggling with housing affordability on a much larger scale than Austin is. In the final 
three months of 2022, the median sale price of a single-family home in the LA MSA was 
$829,000, or the sixth highest in the nation.46 While the City of LA produced 88,000 new 
housing units from 2010 to 2019 (more units relative to its population growth than every city 
in California except Irvine), only 9 percent of new housing units built since 2014 are affordable 
to Angelenos earning less than the area’s median income. In tandem, rent has outpaced 
wage growth to the extent that 70 percent of all households in Los Angeles report having 
to financially stretch themselves to pay for housing.47 A 2019 McKinsey report, Affordable 
housing in Los Angeles: Delivering more—and doing it faster,48 recommended six actions 
Los Angeles could take to accelerate the progress of building affordable housing. A similar 
approach could help Austin get ahead of the curve. 

 — Create a fully integrated and cross-jurisdiction plan. Instead of neighborhoods individually 
seeking to building affordable housing, city planners and local governing bodies could 
create an overarching plan and framework that facilitates an integrated approach. For 
Greater Austin, this means acknowledging that the problem of housing goes beyond

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownthe city of Austin and that new levels of coordination among local governing bodies across 
the Austin MSA may be the only way to enable a cross-cutting plan.

 — Streamline the approval and permitting process. Developers in both Austin and LA cite 
long approval processes for obtaining land and building permits as a major challenge to 
housing development. The 2019 McKinsey report estimated the total development time 
in LA could be reduced by as much as 35 percent by fully digitalizing and integrating 
the approval and permitting processes and making targeted operational changes. 
These could lower the total cost to deliver housing and help developers undertake more 
affordable housing projects by reducing the carrying costs of capital between the time of 
development and when the project first generates occupancy-related income. 

 — Adopt innovative construction approaches to cut costs and accelerate development. 
When standardized construction techniques, such as prefabricated development, are 
adopted at scale, the cost of multifamily housing can be reduced by 5 to 15 percent. 
This approach also facilitates standardized developments that speed the approval and 
construction processes. Greater Austin is home to innovative building companies—such 
as startup ICON Technology, which 3-D prints modular homes—whose techniques can be 
leveraged locally.

 — Raise set-aside requirements to reflect achieved savings. As innovative construction 

techniques lower development costs, multifamily developments will be able to support 
a greater proportion of affordable units while maintaining sufficient returns to secure 
financing. Austin can consider gradually raising set-aside requirements over time as these 
innovative techniques are implemented at scale. Without higher requirements, it is unlikely 
that developers will voluntarily add affordable-housing units to market-driven projects.

 — Stabilize and consolidate public financing for affordable developments. Austin could 
prioritize bringing greater coordination, predictability, and transparency to its current 
slate of affordable-development incentives, such as density bonuses and Affordability 
Unlocked and SMART Housing programs. Doing so while simplifying the approval 
processes could create more consistency in time and funding, allowing faster and more-
reliable development.49 In addition, establishing professional management of city-owned 
land, as New York City and London have done, could maximize the potential of unused or 
underused city-owned land for additional affordable developments. 

 — Support the most vulnerable tenants. It will take time to develop housing for Austin’s 

most vulnerable families, so protections and support for this population may need to be 
expanded. More than 80 percent of Greater Austin’s extremely low-income families face 
severe housing cost burdens. After the end of the COVID-19 eviction moratorium, a social 
safety net may be critical in keeping these families from homelessness.50

Diversity, equity, and 
inclusion: Sharing 
Austin’s prosperity

Much can be done to push Greater Austin toward becoming a 
multicultural epicenter that champions economic success for all, 
regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status.

Greater Austin is, by most metrics, a diverse region: its overall diversity increased from 2010 
to 2020, and Greater Austin is now a majority-minority region (non-Hispanic White residents 
accounted for 49 percent of the total 2021 population).51 Between 2010 and 2021, Greater 
Austin’s White population grew by 23 percent to 1,156,000—the slowest of every major racial 
group. During the same time period, the Hispanic or Latino population grew by 43 percent to 
770,000 people to represent nearly 33 percent of the Austin MSA’s population. Meanwhile, 
the Asian population nearly doubled to 160,000 residents, growing 2.5 times as fast as 
the overall population, and the Black population grew 28 percent, reaching nearly 155,000 
residents in 2021.52

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownHowever, a diverse community is not the lived experience for many, and gentrification has 
led to the displacement of long-standing communities. As a prime example of this dynamic, 
longtime locals point to Central East Austin, a haven for young people moving to Austin from 
coastal cities such as LA. Central East Austin neighborhoods have become increasingly 
homogenous, yet they buzz with hipster coffee shops, chic restaurants, and community 
workspaces. What new residents may not see are the effects of rapid gentrification. Under 
the 1928 Master Plan, Black and Latino Austinites were segregated to present-day East 
Austin, where they formed long-standing minority-majority neighborhoods.53 But these 
neighborhoods have felt the pinch of housing issues, and today their descendants have 
been uprooted from Central East Austin by the hike in housing costs accompanying growth 
(Exhibit 8).

Consider the Martin Luther King neighborhood, which was 52 percent Black in 2010. In 
the following decade, monthly mortgage costs rose at 17 times the national average, and by 
2020, the share of Black residents was just 30 percent.54 Similar trends have left Austin’s 
only historically Black university, Huston-Tillotson University, in a neighborhood where 
only 13 percent of residents are Black, while Austin’s minority communities are pushed to 
the suburbs, especially northward and eastward.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownIn short, while Austin’s economic tide has risen dramatically, not all boats are rising equally. 
Relative to White Austinites, Latino and Black residents are twice as likely to be living in 
poverty and about 50 percent as likely to hold a bachelor’s degree, and they earn about 
50 percent less per capita.55 While minorities make up almost half of the city’s population, they 
own just one-fourth of Austin’s businesses56 (see sidebar “Latino economic mobility”).

There are other challenges to ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth in the workplace 
for residents of all socioeconomic backgrounds. Minority workers are overrepresented in 
occupations vulnerable to replacement by automation, especially in food preparation and 
serving, transportation and material moving, and cleaning and maintenance.57 As the CEO of 
one NPO said: “Our inclusivity issues are economic issues.”

Latino economic mobility

US Latinos are a driving force of the country’s economy and account for the fastest-
growing portion of US GDP.1 Their household spending has, during the past decade, 
increased by 6 percent annually to become a cumulative $1 trillion market in 2021.2 This 
is expected to continue and, if the parity gap between Latinos and non-Latino Whites 
is addressed, the unmet needs of Latino consumers could grow sixfold to $660 billion. 
But several areas require attention, including from improving Latino representation 
and inclusion in decision-making bodies to expanding product portfolios, targeting 
marketing and sales strategies for Latino consumers, increasing access to capital for 
Latino entrepreneurs, and eliminating bias and discrimination.

Confronting increasing homelessness

Although the tents have left Cesar Chavez Street, the facts remain: Austin’s total homeless 
population has risen 8 percent annually since 2015. The city has Texas’s highest per capita 
rate of people experiencing homelessness and the highest proportion of unsheltered 
homeless.58 On a given night in 2022, Travis County alone had approximately the same 
number of people experiencing homelessness (about 3,150) as the entire Houston MSA, 
despite having less than a fifth the population. Homelessness in Austin affects people 
disproportionately, too: 56 percent of the homeless population is male, 36 percent are 
Black, and 22 percent are under the age of 18.59 In addition, 9 percent of people experiencing 
homelessness in Austin are military veterans. While Austin has worked hard to resolve 
homelessness, more needs to be done to prevent it from becoming intractable.

Austin has struggled to deal with homelessness for decades. In 2019, the Austin City Council 
voted to lift a public-camping ban that had been in place for 23 years, only for voters to 
overwhelmingly pass Proposition B in 2021 to reinstate it.60 Almost two years later, the ban 
has decreased the number of visible tents in downtown Austin, but homelessness has 
actually increased. Proponents of the ban argue the city wasn’t doing enough to address

without providing real solutions. 

Allocation of capital resources by city and county leaders is one of the tools for addressing 
the problem, but it should not be the sole focus. Throwing money at the problem will not solve 
it. Local organizations have begun working together more closely over the past couple of 
years to support unsheltered individuals as well as those in danger of becoming homeless, 
but this coordination needs to happen on a larger scale and with a robust, integrated strategic 
plan that recognizes that different organizations address different parts of the problem (see 
sidebar “Lessons from Houston”). 

A diverse community is not 
the lived experience for many, 
and gentrification has led 
to the displacement of long-
standing communities.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownLessons from Houston

In Houston, cross-organization collaboration has been successful in reducing chronic 
homelessness by prioritizing a housing-first strategy. Over the past ten years, the Houston 
MSA’s homeless population has decreased by 56 percent, falling from 7,200 individuals 
in 2012 to 3,150 in 2022.1 The decline continues to be visible: Houston closed its largest 
homeless encampment in February 2023, moving most of its residents into a new housing 
navigation center.2

The Coalition for the Homeless, the lead agency of The Way Home, is a catalyst that unites 
the efforts of local partners, from not-for-profits to corporations and government entities, 
into a cohesive and focused homelessness response.3 Many Houston leaders point to 
the coalition’s cross-organization coordination as the ultimate reason for success. As former 
Houston mayor Annise Parker said, “The bottom line is that nearly everybody in Houston 
involved in homelessness got together around what works. That’s our secret sauce.”4

Coming together to dramatically reduce homelessness in Austin will require integrated 
and coordinated action from a diverse set of stakeholder organizations. Three stages of 
homelessness interventions can be considered5:

 — Preventing entry to homelessness. Homelessness is typically rooted in a complex and 
overlapping web of mental health issues, loss of family, substance use, and systems 
such as criminal justice and foster care. Income insecurity, unstable housing, and failed 
diversion efforts are also prime causes of the initial entry to homelessness. Business 
leaders can play a crucial role in supporting their at-risk employees with in-house 
support services such as flexible work schedules (so employees can attend housing 
appointments), transportation to and from work (such as public-transit credits), and 
personal-finance planning. City and community leaders also have a role to play and can 
provide employment and training programs, when possible; prioritize the affordable-
housing supply; and create diversion and temporary assistance programs that will help 
house at-risk populations. But these efforts are most effective when mutually supportive 
of local healthcare infrastructure.

 — Sheltering and supporting people experiencing homelessness. One local not-for-profit 
leader said, “The shelter infrastructure in Austin just hasn’t kept up with our population 
growth. [Austin’s] homelessness population has grown a lot too, and we just don’t have 
enough beds now.” However, supporting and sheltering Austin’s homeless involves 
more than just building emergency shelters, day services, and transitional housing. It 
will require a cross-organization, coordinated effort to ensure that shelter and support 
infrastructures are mutually supportive and that homeless individuals can access them via 
housing navigation support and employment services. 

 — Improving exits to permanent housing. Expanding the stock of affordable housing can 
help prevent entries to homelessness, but exiting homelessness typically requires 
services such as counseling. Dedicating some public housing to rehoming the homeless 
with support from programs such as housing vouchers is one potential way to help people 
who are experiencing homelessness make the shift to self-sustained housing.

Infrastructure: 
Getting ahead of the 
population boom

Bigger thinking is needed to meet the region’s future economic 
development and mobility needs. But social infrastructure continues 
to contribute to Greater Austin’s strengths as a livable region. 

Gone are the days of the “don’t build it and they won’t come” mantra from Austin, as some 
respondents described it, yet its effects, exacerbated by recent growth trends, continue to be 
felt today. Many people are moving to the suburban areas outside Austin, but the infrastructure 
to support this burgeoning suburban population has not expanded quickly enough, resulting in 
significant road congestion. 

The natural amenities of the region, such as the Barton Creek Greenbelt or the San Marcos River, 
are often cited as what brings people to Austin. But its infrastructure has the potential to restrict 
residents from accessing both these amenities and their jobs. Because the populations of 
Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays, and Williamson Counties are growing faster than that of Travis County, 
the physical infrastructure will need to grow as well to connect those living outside of downtown 
to their jobs. Traffic problems are common in major cities, but Greater Austin has an opportunity 
to dream big and address its future mobility needs today by taking bold steps.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownEasing the congestion crunch

Congestion is nothing new to the average Austinite, but it may only get worse as 
the population center of the Austin MSA shifts further from Central Austin. Austin ranks 
first among all high-growth peers and second among Texas peers (trailing Houston) in 
annual congestion cost per auto commuter. Congestion costs the average Austin commuter 
$1,520 annually, some 14 percent more than Dallas and 80 percent more than peer Raleigh 
(Exhibit 9).61

From 2015 to 2020, Williamson County added more net new commuters than Travis County. 
But because 71 percent of jobs in the region are in Travis County, about 50 percent of workers 
from Williamson County and the other suburban counties are traveling across county lines, 
sometimes driving long distances, to get from home to work.62 Mitigating Greater Austin’s 
congestion is critical, and failing to do so may have broad repercussions for everything from 
affordability to economic growth in Austin and surrounding counties. For example, if Austin’s 
congestion reaches a point of no return, residents who have moved to the suburbs to find 
affordable housing will be cut off from their jobs and historical communities. Furthermore,

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtowncompanies located in downtown Austin will have to pay more to attract talent, and more 
companies may look to locate closer to their workforce. 

Mitigating Austin’s worsening congestion will require coordinated and innovative action on 
multiple fronts—there is no silver bullet. Congestion mitigation efforts can range from small 
efficiency improvements, such as adjusting the timing of traffic signals, to large capital 
projects, such as adding highway lanes. Yet the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, in its 
2021 urban mobility report, recommended a balanced approach to combating congestion—
“one that focuses on more of everything; more policies, programs, projects, flexibility, options, 
and understanding.”63 

In the following sections, we examine two critical mobility solutions for easing Greater Austin’s 
congestion crunch: providing commuters with choices of alternative modes of transportation 
and adding capacity in critical corridors.

Thinking big to increase access to alternative modes of transportation
True to the city’s Texan roots, most Austin residents use a personal vehicle as their primary 
mode of commuting.64 But many residents do not have a viable alternative. CapMetro, Greater 
Austin’s public-transit authority, only services 59 percent of the Austin MSA population as of 
2021, and the majority of residents in Hays, Williamson, Bastrop, and Caldwell Counties do not 
have viable access to public transit.65 As a result, 96 percent of suburban commuters report 
using personal vehicles to commute, compared with 92 percent in Travis County.66 At the same 
time, usage of public transit in Austin remains at only about 50 percent of pre-COVID-19 
ridership levels.67

Project Connect will provide Central Austin residents with additional transit access. Costing 
a now-estimated $10.3 billion, the project’s expanded bus routes and new light-rail and 
passenger rail options will connect existing transit nodes and provide urban commuters with 
safe, reliable, and cheap alternatives to commuting in rush hour traffic.68 To many, public 
light-rail may make Austin feel as though it has “established its place” among the urban 
metropolitan areas of the United States.

Yet statistics published by the City of Austin’s Housing and Planning Department show that 
nearly 39 percent of residential areas within one mile of the project’s proposed rail lines 
classify as active resident displacement risk; 15 percent classify as chronic displacement risk; 
and 67 percent of residents classify as low income.69 The opening of new light-rail lines will 
likely cause adjacent land prices to rise, presenting a real problem: as land prices increase in 
Central Austin, residents most in need of affordable housing and public transit may be forced 
move to the suburbs, where they will not have access to the CapMetro service areas meant to 
serve their needs.

Community leaders need to dream bigger. Even after Project Connect is completed, most 
residents in the suburbs of surrounding counties—including San Marcos, Dripping Springs, 
Round Rock, and Georgetown—will still not have meaningful access to public transit. Even 
residents in Buda will not be serviced by CapMetro, despite living just 15 miles from downtown 
Austin. That is why Austin leaders need to start thinking about the potential for unifying public 
transit and infrastructure to further growth and allow broader access to the opportunities that 
are to come (sidebar “Learning from Seattle’s transit expansion”).

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownLearning from Seattle’s transit expansion

The effort to increase bus ridership in Seattle, Washington, in the context of a national decline 
has been a success story of 21st-century public-transit projects. The growth in public-
transit ridership, notably bus ridership, can largely be attributed to Seattle’s transit demand 
management (TDM) policies, the buy-in of private local employers, and a new fare district to 
subsidize struggling bus routes.1

While the origins of Seattle’s TDM policies date back to the 1990s, the city’s recent success 
is built on employer-mandated commute trip reduction plans that include transit subsidies for 
employees via a new regional transit card. Launched in 2009, the One Regional Card for All 
(ORCA) enables commuters to pay for different transit options (for example, ferries and buses) 
across the region under one account and encourages transit use by setting up employer-
sponsored benefit programs. In fact, employer-related transit benefit programs accounted for 
more than half of ORCA’s initial adoption because the cards offered businesses competitive 
employee perks and pricing and tax benefits.

Since 2015, owners or tenants of large commercial buildings have been required to offer 
transit pass subsidies of at least 50 percent to all building employees.2 And in 2014, 
Seattle voters approved the Seattle Transit Benefit District (STBD) to expand service and 
subsidize struggling bus routes via a 0.1 percent increase in sales tax and a $60 city vehicle 
registration fee.3

Seattle’s transit transformation 
The net result of these changes was a dramatic increase in Seattle’s public-transit ridership 
and a decrease in the proportion of car commuters before the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2019, 
nearly 11 percent of Seattle commuters traveled to work via public transit—an increase of 
15 percent since 2015—which is nearly six times the rate of public-transit use in Austin.4 
Among Austin’s high-growth peers, only Denver experienced an increase in public-transit use 
over the same period (rising 13 percent). Even more impressive was that nearly half of Seattle’s 
downtown workers commuted via transit in 2019, or nearly double the proportion who drove 
alone.5 The Seattle area also experienced a 2.3 percent decrease in the percentage of 
workers commuting via automobiles from 2015 to 2019, and the city saw a decrease in annual 
congestion costs per commuter in 2019, the first decrease since 2008.6

While the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed commuting behavior, this innovative 
and cooperative approach to public-transit solutions could hold lessons for cities like Austin in 
how to improve mobility choices for residents and reduce traffic congestion.

aim to relieve the demand for commute trips through measures such as congestion pricing (for example, tolls), subsidized 
transit passes, incentives for ride-sharing, and improved public-transit offerings and facilities. Coinciding with TDM policy 
changes, Seattle voters also passed a $53.8 billion transportation bill called Sound Transit 3 (ST3) in 2016, a 25-year plan 
to expand the city’s light-rail network by 62 miles to less-accessible neighborhoods and other cities in the region, such 
as Tacoma and Everett. ST3 is the third voter-approved expansion of the Sound Transit authority, which operates across 
three counties in the Greater Seattle metropolitan area. However, the build-out of ST3 has barely begun and cannot be 
considered the source of growth in bus ridership in the 2010s.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownCommitting to adding road and airport capacity
Congestion is unmistakable on Austin’s roads and highways, but it is also occurring in Austin’s 
lone commercial airport, Austin Bergstrom International Airport (AUS). Below, we examine 
the mounting congestion and the marquee mitigation plans for Austin’s road congestion and 
airport overcapacity.

Easing road congestion. COVID-19 offered Austin commuters a temporary reprieve in 2020: 
both traffic and total road usage across the Austin MSA decreased dramatically. Total road 
usage trends, however, suggest congestion has rebounded: 2021 daily vehicle miles traveled 
in the Austin MSA bounced back to 96 percent of its pre-COVID-19 highs.70 Austin’s worst 
congestion is concentrated in the Interstate 35 (I-35) north–south corridor, disproportionately 
affecting commuters coming from Hays and Williamson Counties, who must travel on I-35 
to reach downtown.71 In fact, the eight-mile stretch of I-35 through Central Austin plays 
an outsize role in congesting the region’s roadways: it accounts for 700,000 person-hours in 
annual delays per mile, or about ten times more than the central ten-mile stretch of MoPac.72 

The I-35 Capital Express project features a three-phase expansion of I-35 from State 
Highway 45 North to State Highway 71 designed to alleviate this congestion, with the bulk of 
its $5.6 billion price tag committed to the Central I-35 stretch.73 Induced demand is a well-
known problem of adding capacity to critical roadways, and roadway expansions cannot be 
the only solution to getting workers from suburbs to downtown.

Increasing airport capacity. The city has the second-smallest airport by annual enplaned 
passengers among its high-growth peers but experienced the second-highest growth rate in 
passengers pre-COVID-19 (2016–19).74 In fact, the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport is 
designed to serve 17.1 million total annual passengers following expansions in 2017 but served 
almost 21.1 million total passengers in 2022 alone—an overcapacity of nearly 25 percent.

Austin-Bergstrom International Airport’s AUS 2040 Master Plan includes an expansion to 
serve 31.0 million passengers by 2040 by increasing the total number of gates to 64 from 
36.75 Yet high growth has left the airport already operating above capacity, with a record-
setting 2.02 million total passengers in May 2022 alone compared with a current operational 
capacity of 1.20 million monthly passengers. Should 2017–22 growth rates remain constant, 
Austin-Bergstrom will eclipse 31 million passengers by 2027, ten years ahead of the Master 
Plan’s schedule to meet that mark.76 To serve the continued growth of Greater Austin into 
a major metropolitan area, community leaders need to commit to prioritizing the Master 
Plan for the airport and consider further expansion. Such an airport expansion will benefit 
not only residents and visitors but also the economy and its attractiveness for foreign 
direct investment.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownAmplifying Greater Austin’s strengths as a livable region
Some of the downsides of rapid population and economic growth are easily quantified, such 
as congestion and housing unaffordability. But what about the less tangible costs of growth? 
While Austin ranks middle to high among its peers on metrics such as safety, arguably 
the reason people come to or stay in Austin is because it is Austin—it has an atmosphere that 
cannot be re-created, complemented by social infrastructure including parks, trails, music 
venues, performing arts, dog parks, and access to water, all of which are implicitly part of 
the Austin way of life.77 But the same holds true for surrounding cities such as Georgetown, 
and maintaining a strong cultural proposition in Greater Austin’s growing suburban cities will 
require thoughtful leadership.

The challenge is retaining that X factor that has contributed so much to Austin’s profile and 
recent growth while recent changes threaten to undermine it. A small yet vocal subset of local 
leaders spoke of the need to “double down” on public safety. Only about one in seven leaders 
pointed to public safety as a pressing challenge for Austin, but for those who did, public safety 
was at the top of their lists. One local business leader said, “We have real systemic issues 
with public safety right now. I’m really worried we are trending in the wrong direction.” Others 
pointed to the loss of a strong brand. “I’m very worried about cultural strip-mining,” one NPO 
leader said. “We have lost a lot of our identity with this new growth.” 

If Austin wants to preserve its unique identity and amplify social infrastructure such as its 
renowned music and outdoors scenes, leaders will need to prioritize the city’s brand.

 — Music and arts. Austin’s self-proclaimed title as the “Live Music Capital of the World” is 

both well deserved and misleading. On the surface, Austin leads the country in live-music 
venues per capita, and music lovers have many established venues and events to rely 
upon—SXSW, Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theater, Stubb’s, and Broken Spoke 
are just a few Austin favorites.78 Yet one local music producer described an opportunity to 
bolster support for the backbone of this renowned music scene—the artists. He said that 
Austin’s music scene is best characterized as a “tale of two cities. If you’re a live musician, 
there is always a demand for you. But for recording artists, producers, and technicians, 
Austin is a backhouse music scene. There is such a lack of affordable studio space for 
up-and-coming artists that the only place they seem to find is in backhouses and garage 
apartments.” A prominent local artist had a similar point of view, saying that most peer 
artists and musicians have already left East Austin for San Marcos and Lockhart, Texas. 
The reason? Lack of affordable studio space. Some options for overcoming this hurdle 
include enhancing support grants for music venues and subsidizing creative spaces for 
artists, providing professional development workshops and training (such as business 
planning and budgeting), and supporting public–private partnerships that promote 
“music hubs.”

violent crime rate compared with high-growth peers (below median; out of eight) but the third-highest property crime rate 
(above median).

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtown — Nature. Austinites takes pride in the region’s parks, trails, and water amenities, with 19.1 
acres available per 1,000 people and 26.9 total trail miles per 100,000 people.79 Austin 
has the highest Trust for Public Lands Park score of any major Texas city (39). But one 
local sector leader suggested Austin could be doing more to bolster its reputation as 
a nation-leading outdoors city, and the data agrees: Austin’s ranking in the Trust for Public 
Land Park has slipped from 19 in 2012 and is today far behind peers such as Minneapolis 
(five) and Denver (18).80 Proactively preserving and amplifying park access could allow 
Austin to keep up with its fast-growing population. And with an abundance of beautiful 
scenery, the city has a chance to earn its place as an epicenter for access to the outdoors 
not only in Texas but also in the nation. However, this will take investment and action.

First, Austin could prioritize and develop parks in currently underserved areas while 
ensuring equitable upkeep of parks in West and East Austin. Several community leaders 
pointed to the Waterloo Greenway’s success in attracting corporate partners as a model, 
with corporate sponsors and developers investing in public green space knowing 
the projects will benefit their business, employees, and local residents.81 Although Austin 
is already spending $178 per capita to maintain and expand the city’s park system (more 
than any other major Texas city), it’s well behind peers such as Washington, DC (ranked 
first in ParkScore, spending $284 per capita per year), and Minneapolis ($317).82 

Traffic problems are common 
in major cities, but Greater 
Austin has an opportunity 
to dream big and address 
its future mobility needs 
today by taking bold steps.

Environmental 
sustainability: 
Building climate 
resiliency 

Austin is at the forefront of sustainability, but can it lead the 
region to long-term environmental resilience?

A hotter and drier future looms for Greater Austin. If global warming reaches the 2°C 
threshold, Central Texas will face drastic increases in water and heat stress (see sidebar 
“Warming warning”). This will have downstream effects on businesses and residents, 
including on quality of life, outdoor working hours, and tourism. Preventive actions need to 
be taken to protect the sustainability of Austin’s growth in the face of a changing climate. Yet 
because only one in five respondents said climate resiliency was a top challenge for the future 
of the region, the first step in building climate resiliency is for the community to understand 
what is at stake. 

37

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownWarming warning

As of 2021, the planet had already warmed 1.1°C above preindustrial levels (1850–1900).1 
Under the Paris Agreement, adopted by 196 parties in 2015, global leaders are striving 
to limit the Earth’s warming to below 2.0°C (or about 3.6°F) and to limit the increase to 
1.5°C (or 2.7°F) above preindustrial levels to avoid severe climate disruptions that could 
exacerbate severe weather events, conflict, and hunger worldwide.2

1  Lauren Sommer, “This is what the world looks like if we pass the crucial 1.5-degree climate threshold,” NPR, 

November 8, 2021.

2  The Paris Agreement, adopted by 196 parties in 2015, agrees to “hold the increase in the global average 

temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase 
to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.” For more, see “The Paris Agreement,” UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, accessed February 13, 2023.

To address sustainability for the region, we primarily examine how Austin’s economic 
development and future can be both climate resilient and decarbonized. After all, the City of 
Austin has set lofty sustainability goals under the Climate Equity Plan, and Austin Energy is 
targeting 100 percent carbon-free electric generation by 2035 (see sidebar “Austin’s Climate 
Equity Plan).83 

Austin’s Climate Equity Plan

Austin’s leaders have been vocal about combating climate change, pledging in the city’s 
Climate Equity Plan to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 2040. It’s 
the most ambitious climate pledge among Austin’s peers and is on par with major cities 
such as New York City and Seattle. The Climate Equity Plan focuses on five areas: 
sustainable buildings, transportation and land use, transportation electrification, 
food and product consumption, and natural systems. Immediate efforts are focused 
on buildings, an area in which increased renewable-energy use has helped reduce 
emissions by 20 percent despite 20 percent population growth in the past eight years. 
But the largest contributors to GHG emissions in 2019 were transportation (39 percent), 
electricity (38 percent), and industrials (8 percent).1

total renewables capacity is currently about 2,900 megawatts, or 63 percent of the total 4,600-megawatt generation 
capacity (from wind, solar, and biomass).

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownA region already under climate stress

Climate forecasts suggest an increasingly dry future for Austin, which could be exacerbated 
without proactive management. Most of Greater Austin sources its water from Texas’s 
Colorado River. The Highland Lakes, including Greater Austin’s Lake Travis, Lake Austin, 
and Ladybird Lake, provide both drinking water and recreation for the region.84 In fact, 
many residents point to this water access (which also includes celebrated springs such 
as Barton Springs) as the underpinning of Austin’s lifestyle appeal. But without proactive 
management, Austin could face an increasingly dry future. In the past decade, Central Texas 
experienced one of its worst recorded droughts, fueling the Bastrop County Complex fire 
of 2011 (the most destructive in state history) and creating images of dry lakes, dead rivers, 
shriveled landscape, and absent wildlife that remain fresh in the memory of residents.85 
Given an additional 2°C of global warming, water stress will increase by up to 50 percent in 
parts of Greater Austin. Meanwhile, the region is projected to experience up to seven years 
of hydrological drought—years with two- to four-month-long periods of significantly below 
average precipitation—each decade. 

Such projections suggest the supply of water into these systems may invert the imbalance 
between supply and demand (Exhibit 10). Despite Central Texas’s high levels of population 
growth, the real problem of increased water stress lies upstream of Austin, where water 
stress projections are even more drastic (with some areas projecting to see 150 percent 
increases).86 Higher projected temperatures and lower precipitation totals reduce the inflows 
to the Colorado River’s midbasin, which generates most of the water that downstream 
customers rely on, and increase the evapotranspiration of water stored in the Highland 
Lakes.87 In fact, water curtailments are already a reality for downstream users. In 2021, 
agricultural customers on the Texas coast (primarily rice farmers) used more water than 
the City of Austin and its 960,000 residents.88 Given 2022’s extraordinary drought conditions, 
however, these agricultural customers were cut off from Highland Lakes water for the year 
under the Lower Colorado River Authority’s Water Management Plan.89

Rising water stress may heighten tensions over Colorado River water rights. As one 
manufacturing sector leader noted, “Water is business continuity—simple as that. No water, 
and our growth could stop.” While some respondents hailed the City of Austin’s Water 
Forward plan as a sign that improvement of aquifer management systems is coming, one 
industry professional painted a more dire picture. “It’s time for the region as a whole to really 
commit to water security investments—there will no more unaccounted water in our lakes 
in a decade,” he said. “I understand that making investments for future water security is not 
glamorous, but then again, a lack of water could cause everything to come to a halt.” (See 
sidebar “Water woes out West.”)

40

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownWater woes out West

The Colorado River that runs through Texas has the same name as a larger river 
to the west. From its origins in the Rocky Mountains, the other Colorado River and 
its tributaries wind through seven western US states before crossing the Mexican 
border. It is also the most visible sign of water shortages to come in the nation. Forty 
million US residents in the western United States depend on the Colorado River for 
water (including those in the California cities of Los Angeles and San Diego, which lie 
outside of the basin).1 However, 70 percent of Colorado River water supplies are used 
for agriculture, primarily in Arizona.2 Prolonged record drought has reduced Colorado 
River flow by an average of nearly 20 percent in the 21st century, and continued 
warming temperatures in the upper basin will likely contribute to flow reductions of 
35 percent or more by the end of the century.3 In August 2022, the US Department of 
Interior announced a tier-two water shortage on the Colorado River, calling for a two- to 
four-million-acre-feet curtailment of water from the river in 2023, causing Arizona, for 
example, to face a 21 percent reduction in water use.4 This announcement is just one 
example of a water supply crunch in the region and a ripple effect on water allocation 
to municipal and agricultural sources and cherished ecosystems such as the Grand 
Canyon. While Texas’s Colorado River is not projected to face the same level of water 
shortages, these water woes can provide the Greater Austin community with a valuable 
look ahead into the future of water shortages.

Extreme heat. Outdoor labor is the bedrock of the Austin economy, building the infrastructure 
necessary to support a growing region and providing jobs and financial security to many 
people who call Texas home. The implications of 2°C warming, however, pose a serious threat 
to outdoor work: high temperatures could render five out of seven midsummer workdays 
unworkable, reducing working hours and wages, and low-income populations would be 
the most vulnerable.90 Construction firms may need to adapt their field force operating 
protocols, shifting hours into the early days or nights, providing climate-protective work 
gear, and potentially running businesses on a seasonal basis in cooler months. Heat waves 
are projected to lengthen in duration, with 200 percent increases expected in Greater 
Austin, approaching nearly three months of heat wave conditions annually.91 The effects on 
Austin include an increased strain on the electrical grid, potentially leading to blackouts, and 
an increased risk of air pollution, drought, and wildfire. 

Taking action to decarbonize economic development

For Austin to meet its ambitious sustainability goals, and for the region to become more 
climate resilient, finding a way to grow economically while decarbonizing is key.92 The biggest 
opportunities lie in power generation, transportation, and buildings.

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownPower. Austin Energy electrons are the greenest in the history of the city, with grams of CO2 
per kilowatt-hour declining 37 percent from 2011 to 2019 as the grid shifted from coal to gas 
and renewables.93 More than 70 percent of Austin Energy’s generation is now carbon-free, 
and on a per capita basis, CO2 emissions have decreased by 25 percent annually. Yet Austin 
Energy missed a critical goal of exiting its Fayette Power Plant by 2022.94 The plant alone 
accounts for 80 percent of Austin Energy’s generation-related emissions (and 28 percent 
of all of Austin’s GHG emissions), and its continued operation reduces the feasibility of 
fulfilling the climate pledges of both Austin Energy and the City of Austin.95 Replacing those 
600 megawatts with “always on” renewables enabled by batteries would significantly 
improve the emissions profile, and the batteries could be sited near existing plants to provide 
additional local jobs for construction and upkeep. But green energy will hardly benefit Austin 
residents if it cannot reliably keep the power on during unexpected weather events.96

Transportation. Another 36 percent of emissions comes from transportation.97 Austin is well 
positioned to roll out electric vehicles (EVs); the city’s robust EV infrastructure is second 
highest among its national high-growth peers (trailing only Salt Lake City), which befits 
the home of leading EV manufacturer Tesla.98 With gasoline prices hitting highs in 2022, 
a shift to EVs could save the average commuter money while improving local air quality (Austin 
currently leads Texas peers in good air quality days and is fourth among all high-growth 
and Texas peers).99 Further investment in public transportation, specifically light-rail, can 
lower the cost of transportation and improve the ability of Austin’s low-income population to 
participate in its vibrant central economy. 

Buildings. Even excluding their electricity usage, buildings account for an additional 
12 percent of Austin’s emissions through natural-gas hookups to power heaters, stoves, 
dryers, and generators.100 Although building codes have improved the efficiency of new 
homes, much of the building stock was built prior to 1960. Insulation retrofitting (for example, 
R-30 wall insulation, double-paned windows, weather-sealed thresholds) could further cut 
emissions, energy, and bills, while switching to more-efficient electrical appliances could also 
help households save on energy costs (see sidebar “Decarbonizing Ithaca”). Austin has begun 
building with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications in mind. 
As of January 2021, the city had 36 LEED-certified buildings with 46 more certifications 
under way.101

Uniquely Austin: Stewarding growth in America’s boomtownDecarbonizing Ithaca

Ithaca, New York, made headlines in 2021 as the first city to establish and approve 
a plan to decarbonize and electrify all its buildings by 2030.1 Home to Cornell University, 
Ithaca is a small city of about 32,000 residents that generates about $82 million in total 
revenue annually, so financing its estimated $600 million complete retrofit has required 
the city to get creative.2 Ithaca has partnered with a start-up climate tech company and 
a private equity firm to secure more than $100 million in funding. Using a city-backed 
rebate and loan model allows Ithaca to reduce the cost up front for homeowners who 
otherwise couldn’t afford these changes, allowing equitable access to retrofits that are 
both profitable and carbon-neutral in the long term. This is a new initiative but one to 
keep an eye on as a model to reapply elsewhere.

Conclusion

Forging a united 
path forward

Through a collaborative approach, Greater Austin has the 
potential to set the standard for how a metropolis can steward 
sustainable and inclusive growth.

Greater Austin is at a crossroads. The Greater Austin region has the opportunity to define 
the path forward for other metropolitan areas addressing the inevitable challenges of 
transitioning to a large and thriving metropolis. Capitalizing on momentum is critical to 
unlocking this future, but success demands buy-in from the entire community. All need to 
come together to shepherd Greater Austin toward future growth that is both sustainable 
and inclusive. 

Elsewhere in the United States, employer-led civic alliances have succeeded in driving impact 
around societal challenges through sustained, multilateral engagement. They have been 
particularly successful in offering a targeted, data-driven, and action-oriented approach to 
tackling social challenges. One example of a particularly successful regional civic partnership 
is the Itasca Project in Minnesota.102 Itasca shares four common values with other successful 
civic partnerships:

When business and civic leaders in Minneapolis began to worry in the early 2000s that 
Minneapolis had lost its competitive edge, a small group of business leaders decided that 
something needed to be done. Itasca would later be born from an organic and genuine desire 
to effect positive social change among Minneapolis’s business leaders, and the earliest 
iterations of Itasca meetings were weekly breakfast meetings. At the first official meeting 
in September 2003, the Minnesota governor at the time, Tim Pawlenty, said, “This could be 
the most important meeting in the state, or it could be nothing.” Twenty years later, the former 
holds some truth—the meeting galvanized CEOs and leaders to take aligned action on 
Minneapolis’ pressing issues. Today, Itasca is a trisector partnership that drives impact 
through CEO-led task forces and has tackled local challenges from housing affordability and 
improving higher education to closing socioeconomic employment gaps. 

For all its recent growth, Greater Austin remains early in its evolution. That is why it can 
embrace the unique opportunity to model what it means to be a region that champions 
diversity and multiculturalism, supports open cross-aisle dialogue, and remains a vibrant, 
welcoming community. It is not alone in grappling with changes wrought by being a desirable 
place to live—but Greater Austin does control its destiny when it comes to solutions. In 
that respect, the changes that must be made, the actions that must be prioritized, and 
the coalitions that must be formed are not about making Austin the next Silicon Valley or 
Seattle. They are about making Greater Austin an even better steward of its growth and 
a more sustainable and inclusive version of itself.
