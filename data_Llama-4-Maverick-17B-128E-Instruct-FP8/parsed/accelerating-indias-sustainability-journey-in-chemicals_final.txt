Sustainability is taking centre stage in society and the business world amid shifting demand from 
conscious customers, growing investor awareness and stricter regulations. This is leading to greater 
scrutiny of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations in chemicals, a sector that has 
historically been linked to environmental concerns due to energy-intensive operations, high greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions, and improper waste disposal. 

These concerns also reflect in the ESG scores of chemical companies. For example, in a McKinsey 
analysis of ESG scores across 100 global organizations, few chemical corporations appeared in the top 
quartile (scores over 71) and close to half scored in the bottom two quartiles (below the median of 43). 

Several companies in the industry are already taking significant strides towards improvement by 
employing innovative technologies to cut down emissions, kicking off decarbonization efforts, and 
enabling other sectors to become more sustainable. 

While these are important steps, the stark realities of climate change and environmental consciousness 
require the industry to do more. To begin with, more companies in the sector – big and small – could take 
a holistic approach to ESG and strive to perform better on environmental metrics. It may also be helpful 
to focus on the tangible benefits of ESG and sustainability – which could contribute to improved returns 
for shareholders and higher valuations for chemical companies. 

Industry leaders embarking on their ESG journeys could look at three priorities as a starting point:

1. 

 Formulating an ESG vision and strategy: Companies could review current business practices to 
understand where they stand and what could be changed. They could then prioritize sustainability 
drivers that matter most, use this information to formulate a clear ESG vision and communicate it to 
all stakeholders.

2. 

 Improving decarbonization efforts: Since emissions are a major consideration in the environmental 
impact of the chemical industry, companies could focus on decarbonization efforts across different 
levels of emission.  

3. 

 Exploring green growth opportunities: They could develop products with a focus on sustainability 
to meet the needs of today’s environmentally conscious customers. 

Finally, companies need additional enablers to execute their ESG strategy successfully. They could 
ensure cross-functional alignment on aspirations and priorities, strict adherence to timelines and 
guardrails set by the ESG vision and strengthen teams traditionally leading ESG – Health Safety & 
Environment, Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility. Learning from peers and 
their ESG strategies could prove to be enlightening and serve as a guide for leaders through their 
sustainability journey.

Accelerating India’s sustainability journey in chemicals1.

Sustainability at the heart of 
next-gen chemicals strategy 

The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, held at Glasgow in 2021, differed 
from its 25 predecessors in one critical aspect. Countries and governments not only acknowledged the 
harmful effects of climate change but also vowed to initiate mitigative action. Conversations seemed 
to have finally moved away from ‘Why do we need to act?’ to the more proactive ‘How can we act?’ and 
‘What can we do?’ 

This transition from the why to the how is 
increasingly apparent in business as well. 
Environmentally conscious stakeholders expect 
higher environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) standards from companies, pushing 
organizations in India and abroad to launch 
decarbonization and net-zero efforts.

Inaction is no longer an option for the chemicals 
industry – a top contributor to greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions and heavily reliant on fossil fuels. 

The question of the hour seems to be: what role 
could sustainability play in building resilient 
businesses and unlocking tangible value.

In this report, we take different approaches 
to answer that question. Organizations could 
improve their ESG performance not just to 
embrace sustainability but also to create value 
beyond their top and bottom lines, thus meeting 
the expectations of key stakeholders–customers, 
investors and regulators. 

 — E, environmental criteria include the 

energy a company uses and the waste it 
discharges. Besides electricity, energy used 
may include resources such as water and 
non-renewable feedstock. Greenhouse gas 
emissions comprise the major part of the 
waste in the sector.

 — S, social criteria include a company’s 
contribution towards safeguarding its 
labour, customers, and the communities 
within which it operates. 

 — G, governance is the internal system of 
practices and procedures a company 
adopts to make decisions and manage risks

While companies should approach ESG 
holistically and spread out their strategy across 
all three levers (E,S and G), this report primarily 
focuses on environmental aspects.

Some companies in the industry are already making progress by kicking off clean energy initiatives and 
helping other sectors become more sustainable. They have consistently outperformed peers in terms 
of TRS (total return to shareholders) and the report uses learnings from such examples to introduce 
a framework that could help Indian chemical companies to build and implement a sustainability strategy. 
The first step is recognising the hurdles to sustainability in an energy-intensive industry such as 
chemicals. 

The challenges to sustainability  
McKinsey research shows that the chemicals sector alone contributes to 2 percent of the total global 
emissions and 1 percent of India emissions. Even within the industrials category, chemicals contribute to 
7 percent of total greenhouse gases (GHG) released worldwide (Exhibit 1).1

Complex processes across the chemicals value chain are responsible for these high levels. Companies 
heavily depend on fossil fuels due to the lack of renewable feedstock, depleting precious natural 
resources. Meanwhile, limited sustainable disposal options add to concerns ranging from incineration 
emissions to toxicity from non-biodegradable wastes. 

The industry’s challenges in this area also pull down its ESG performance (Exhibit 2), as measured 
by prominent rating agencies such as S&P ESG, Refinitiv, Sustainalytics, DJSI and MSCI.2 A recent

3  Quartiles were created using all the ESG scores across industries/ companies with median as 43. ESG scores for each company 

segregated as ‘high’ (score >71), ‘medium’ (71>score>43) and ‘low’ (score<43) as per the quartiles. Companies were then aggregated as 
per their respective industry getting a distribution amongst ‘high’, ‘medium’ and ‘low’ ESG scores.

Accelerating India’s sustainability journey in chemicalsWith several forces prompting ESG adoption in the chemicals industry, the low ESG scores could 
gradually improve. Stakeholders are pushing for greener practices in chemicals operations, while a 
more visible link between sustainability and value creation is further encouraging companies to align 
themselves to ESG norms.

Stakeholder preferences
The most prominent push for change comes from conscious customers who prefer eco-friendly 
alternatives. Over 70 percent of customers surveyed on purchases across multiple industries were ready 
to pay an additional 5 percent for a green product if it performed as well as a non-green alternative.4

Investors are not far behind – ESG-linked projects often attract funds more easily. In a McKinsey global 
survey on valuing ESG programs, 83 percent of C-suite leaders and investment professionals indicated 
they were willing to pay close to a 10 percent premium to acquire companies with a positive ESG record 
over those with a negative one. In fact, global sustainable investment stood at about USD 30 trillion in 
2018 — up 68 percent from 2014.5

Meanwhile, stricter regulations in key geographies and markets are ensuring companies comply with 
environment-friendly policies. The European Union, for example, is pushing for stringent regulations on 
cross-border carbon tax, using the proceeds to fund sustainability initiatives.6 A company’s location may 
no longer shield it from environmental legislation, encouraging organizations with global supply chains to 
adhere to ESG and carbon emission norms. 

Finally, end-market alignment with sustainability is also increasing, creating demand for bio-based or 
green products. For example, sales of Unilever’s water-saving dishwasher liquid and other eco-friendly 
brands outpaced category growth by about 20 percent.7 Companies that continue to embrace greener 
processes in the long term may find their growth compounding over the years: Finland’s Neste, founded 
as a traditional petroleum-refining company more than 70 years ago, now generates more than two-
thirds of its profits from renewable fuels and sustainability-related products.

Sustainability as a value creator
A focus on sustainability helps companies create tangible value in the present and future. Reducing 
exposure to carbon, for instance, could allow chemical companies to get a wallet-share of customers 
who have pledged to cut their carbon footprint. This translates into increased market share, improved 
ESG ratings and a potential boost to TRS (Exhibit 3).8

Aligning business to sustainability end-markets such as EVs, Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage 
(CCUS), water and waste management, and bio-based consumer products could be an even more 
robust growth driver.9 For example, China’s plan to combat air pollution is expected to create more than 
USD 3 trillion worth of investment opportunities through 2030, across industries such as air quality 
monitoring, indoor air purification and cement mixing. Companies that align their business to such end 
markets could also gain investor confidence, again leading to a higher TRS.

Chemical companies that embrace sustainable practices could see themselves as investing in a resilient 
future. They ensure long-term business continuity as environmental regulations, such as mandatory 
zero liquid discharge, ‘net-zero’ emissions or carbon neutrality, grow increasingly stringent worldwide. 
But how exactly do industry leaders approach such a transition? The following section proposes three 
themes Indian chemical CXOs could consider to build their sustainability programme.

Accelerating India’s sustainability journey in chemicals2. Three priorities for industry 

CXOs approaching ESG

Uncertain about where to begin their sustainability journey, many Indian chemical companies have 
waited to see what their peers would do, keeping them in a state of inertia. This reflects in their low 
ESG scores, a critical area that needs immediate attention.10 Since different agencies base their ESG 
assessments on a range of factors, companies should aim to perform well across all of them. 

An analysis of ESG scores in the industry shows two big ways in which companies can catch up11:

 — Improving engagement with ESG rating agencies: Rating agencies rely on information from 
companies or public data to complete assessments. The fact that only 10 of the top 50 Indian 
chemical companies have S&P ESG ratings, and just six have Refinitiv scores, could highlight limited 
engagement. Ensuring regular communication with agencies might thus help companies gain 
momentum on their ESG journeys.

 — Doing better on environment-related criteria: There is a large gap between the average ESG 
scores of the top 10 Indian chemical companies (32) and their global counterparts (70). While 
performance on social and governance metrics is comparable between the two groups, global 
companies did better on environment-related criteria (Exhibit 4). Indian chemical companies could 
design better initiatives to battle environmental challenges and climate change to bridge this gap.

On the bright side, the industry does well on some levers. A number of big companies have already 
formulated comprehensive ESG plans. These typically include decarbonization initiatives, increased 
investment in ESG, and meticulously tracking sustainability performance and outcomes.12 In terms of 
ESG scores, Indian chemical companies consistently perform better than their global peers on codes 
of business conduct, operational efficiency, customer relationship management and human capital 
development.13

Learnings from such examples in India and abroad suggest a three-step approach to ESG and adopting 
sustainable practices: 

1. Formulating an ESG vision and strategy
The first step to crafting a clear ESG vision and strategy is running an internal diagnostic that reveals 
what is working well (and what is not) in the company’s current business practices. The following 
approach could shape the diagnostic:  

 — Identify a baseline. Review the organization’s current practices, its evolution, and how it compares 

with relevant peers from similar industries.

 — Assess the industry landscape. Understand what industry peers are doing as part of their ESG 
efforts. Also, what can new technologies accomplish in terms of revamping current operations? 

 —  Ask what economics are at stake in the short, medium and long term. Establish a clear link between 

ESG and value creation to prioritize the sustainability drivers that matter most.

Accelerating India’s sustainability journey in chemicalsWhen asked what could help companies get going on their sustainability goals, the former CEO of Coca-
Cola Enterprises, John Brock, said organizations should decide what is important, communicate it, and 
act on it.14

Executives looking to draw up an effective ESG strategy could adopt a holistic approach by incorporating 
elements across environmental (GHG emissions, resource usage including water, operating efficiency), 
social (occupational health and safety, human rights, community engagement) and governance (business 
ethics, presence of independent directors, diversity) factors.

It is critical to proactively communicate ESG goals, initiatives and progress to all stakeholders, including 
the government, organizations, and financial institutions. Keeping these stakeholders in the loop is 
important as they often influence the business environment and could play an essential role in delivering 
future ESG plans. 

2. Increasing decarbonization efforts
With growing awareness of climate change, it is critical that companies centre their ESG strategy 
on reducing GHG emissions. At the COP26 summit at Glasgow in 2021, more than 130 countries 
representing 70 percent of global emissions set net-zero targets.15

According to GHG protocol, emissions can be classified across three categories:

 — Scope 1 includes direct GHG emissions from sources owned or controlled by the organization. 
This could include, for instance, emissions associated with fuel combustions from boilers and 
furnaces.

 — Scope 2 includes indirect GHG emissions associated with purchasing electricity, steam, heat, or 

cooling. For example, such emissions could occur at facilities generating electricity. 

 — Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that result from a company’s activities but originate at 
sources not owned or controlled by the company. Extracting and producing purchased materials, 
transporting purchased fuels, using and disposing of final products could cause such emissions. 

In a typical chemicals value chain, 15 to 30 percent of the total GHG emissions come from production 
operations and are classified as Scope 1 and 2 emissions.16 Most GHG emissions are Scope 3, which 
is much more challenging to ascertain. The data required to evaluate these emissions is not always 
available from suppliers and customers, forcing companies to rely on models or approximations to 
estimate their carbon footprint. Nevertheless, even a less-than-perfect picture could act as that much-
needed catalyst for improvement. 

Decarbonization targets in the chemical industry 
Several global chemical companies have proactively committed to long-term reductions in GHG 
emissions and eventual net-zero aspirations. Sixteen of the top 20 global chemical companies have 
pledged to cut a percentage of their GHG emissions by 2030, and nine committed to achieve net-zero 
carbon emissions by 2050. BASF has cut its GHG emissions by almost 50 percent over the last three 
decades, despite doubling production volumes. It achieved this using patented catalysts to lower 
carbondioxide emissions and increasing efficiency at its plants.17 

In comparison, Indian chemical companies are lagging. Only five of the top 20 Indian chemical 
companies have set GHG reduction targets until 2030, and none have declared a target year to achieve 
net-zero emissions (Exhibit 5).18

Evaluating options for end-to-end decarbonization 
The chemical industry relies heavily on hydrocarbons as feedstock and energy sources, inviting 
constant regulatory and public scrutiny. However, since most Scope 1 and 2 emissions are controllable, 
kickstarting decarbonization efforts could not only have a positive ecological impact but also facilitate 
cross-sectoral benefits (since chemicals form the base of several industries).

Organizations could consider a variety of approaches to decarbonization: 

1.  Energy efficiency or process set-up changes: These involve process innovations, including 

catalysts, thermal modelling for loss mitigation, or closing material loops through circular economy 
solutions. Although the industry has been good at this traditionally, the advent of predictive analytics 
(e.g., AI-powered energy management) could further improve processes.

2.  Carbon Capture, Utilization & Storage (CCUS) on emissions: These solutions aim to capture 

carbon dioxide and convert it into more valuable products (e.g., biofuel, concrete) while retaining the 
carbon neutrality of the production processes. 

3.  Electrification with carbon-neutral power: Electrification of the transport system and chemical 

processes, substituting fossil-based hydrocarbons with renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, 
bioenergy), is critical to decarbonization efforts.

4.  Hydrogen as fuel: Increased use of decarbonized blue (produced from natural gas with carbon 

capture technology) and green (from electrolysis with renewable energy) hydrogen has immense 
potential to reduce emissions from industrial production processes and electricity generation.

5.  Biobased fuel and feedstock: Sustainable feedstocks like plant or animal fats, starch, or sugar, can 

help produce bio-based chemicals such as alcohols, polyesters, and other products. 

6.  New cracking technologies: Innovative cracking technologies efficiently cut carbon content across 
production processes, e.g., incorporating chemical looping could facilitate highly efficient carbon 
dioxide separation during fuel combustion in cracker operations.

It is also crucial to acknowledge that implementing a 20 to 30 year decarbonization roadmap is a 
complex, organization-wide effort. From developing an effective ESG strategy to involving critical 
functions – either as deployment leads (e.g., manufacturing, supply chain and logistics) or critical 
enablers (e.g., digital and analytics, organization strengthening and governance), the process demands 
meticulous planning and flawless execution. 

13

Accelerating India’s sustainability journey in chemicalsImplications for CXOs as they formulate their decarbonization action plan
After analyzing the ESG journeys of several global chemical players, we collated a list of insights that 
could help Indian chemical CXOs kick off their decarbonization efforts:

 — Craft a detailed roadmap to achieve decarbonization aspirations. This is more logical than moving 
fast. Economic implications and technological breakthroughs are two key factors that could 
drastically alter an organization’s decarbonization strategy in the long run; it is wise to account for the 
possibility of such changes from the get-go.

 — Ensure strict compliance with regulations and reporting standards. Decarbonize own operations and 

assess physical and transition risk.

 — Follow an integrative, collaborative approach across functions, including decarbonizing the supply 
base through sustainable sourcing, low carbon mobility in logistics and renewable energy use in 
manufacturing, green financing, innovative product development solutions, and advanced analytics.

 — Pursue levers that have positive Net Present Values immediately (e.g., loss reduction, energy 

efficiency, use of renewable power in the overall energy mix).

 — Include nascent technologies (e.g., green hydrogen, CCUS) in the roadmap only after their economic 

feasibility is achieved.

Although decarbonization remains a key focus area for Indian chemical companies, it is critical to 
recognize that other sustainability topics (e.g., water conservation and zero liquid discharge, waste 
reduction including end of life management) could be as relevant based on context and the company.

3. Exploring green growth opportunities 

Building green products and businesses is critical to responding to sustainability challenges and 
addressing emerging customer demand and technology shifts. Companies could look at revamping 
existing products with a focus on sustainability (e.g., using bio-based inputs) or aligning with 
environmentally conscious end-markets.

Introducing green products 
Several companies may want to radically reinvent their processes to introduce bio-based or less carbon-
intensive products, thereby balancing their portfolio of products. Many global and Indian companies use 
green feedstock and sustainable processes. 

Solvay owns several brands that offer green alternatives to existing products in the market – e.g., 
Augeo is a cleaning solvent that uses glycerine from soybean instead of traditional petrochemicals.19 
UPL’s green product Zeba is an in-furrow application, derived from corn starch, which improves water 
retention and soil health.20 Jubilant Ingrevia uses ethanol instead of traditional petro-based feedstock 
while manufacturing pyridine.21 Ethanol, derived from sugarcane molasses, is not only a cost-effective 
alternative but also cuts carbon emissions by 34 percent.

Entering greener segments 
Decarbonization-driven megatrends could lead to a USD 4 to 5 trillion addressable global market 
by 2025 across multiple sub-themes (Exhibit 6).22 Indian chemical companies could realign their 
portfolios to tap these trends.

Accelerating India’s sustainability journey in chemicalsBASF’s corporate purpose says, ‘creating chemistry for a sustainable future’.23 Sustainable solutions 
contribute substantially to the company’s overall business, accounting for EUR 16.7 billion in sales 
in 2020. The company plans to boost this number to EUR 22 billion by 2025. 

LG Chemicals, a leading manufacturer of EV battery materials, also produces several other eco-friendly 
materials, e.g., NanoH2O, an RO membrane that treats seawater and is used in several large desalination 
projects.24

Several companies also offer services to treat industrial wastewater and produce coagulants, 
flocculants, heavy metal removers, RO membranes, and micro solutions for secondary treatment. 
These are further examples of how chemical companies can create value while helping other 
organizations become sustainable.

Sustainability is more than a feel-good exercise and an avenue for cost reduction. A tough stance, and a 
significant investment of time, money and resources could be necessary for companies to fulfil their bold 
ESG commitments.

Executing ESG strategy 
at chemical companies

The transition to clean energy could have a profound impact on every aspect of the chemicals business. 
Company leaders must move away from small-scale disjointed efforts to a more holistic, transformational 
approach. They could start by learning from other Indian chemical companies that have made progress in 
executing their ESG plans. Further, they could utilize enablers such as milestone-based tracking systems 
and a supportive organization structure to mobilize execution.

Learning from the success of others
Top Indian chemical companies with high ESG scores follow comprehensive and actionable plans. 
Some learnings from their examples include:

 — CEOs and boards must take an active interest in sustainability performance and frequently 

review progress. For example, a leading chemical company conducts reviews on a half-yearly 
basis, verifying reported data through systematic internal and external audits. It also publishes 
a comprehensive sustainability performance report annually, as per Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
standards. 

 — Holistically approaching environmental criteria, focusing on GHG reduction (Scope 1 and 2), energy 
efficiency, and cutting down water consumption is essential. Currently, several chemical companies 
meticulously monitor and report data on their initiatives, set proactive targets, and improve initiatives 
by modifying processes and adopting new technologies. 

 — Companies monitor global sustainability trends and improve their initiatives as per best practices. 

By doing this, a top agrochemical company has significantly changed its ESG strategy. 

 — Some are also incorporating social and governance policies, e.g., communicating progress on 

UN Sustainable Development Goals, setting up human rights guidelines, encouraging transparency, 
and ensuring safety at manufacturing facilities.

 — Another ESG leader in the industry is focusing on delivering value-based outcomes for all 

stakeholders. The company leverages core capabilities to create sustainable solutions for farmers 
and employs processes that mitigate climate change risks. It also prioritizes enhancing world food 
security, improving yields, sustainable sourcing, and strengthening community well-being through 
education, health, and sanitation.

Tracking milestones along the transformation journey
To create real change, chemical companies could think bigger than one-off, scattered initiatives and 
develop a long pipeline of projects that solve real-world problems and leverage technology. Next, they 
must identify critical changes that could clean their value chains, rank them in ascending order of cost 
per ton of abated carbon and map them to their respective prices.25 To beat the cost curve, companies 
could pick some immediately actionable initiatives and develop a long-term view on sustainability for 
business continuity. 

For the short term, they could look to cut emissions by implementing known technologies and 
approaches in the control room, on the shopfloor and across the organization. Milestone tracking could 
be critical here to keep a sharp eye on progress. ESG initiatives could follow a structured stage-gated 
process to ensure focus on bottom-up planning and successful implementation. Each initiative must go 
through five phases or ‘gates’ to be cleared (Exhibit 7).

A long-term view on business continuity could lead executives to other possibilities that do not currently 
appear on the abatement curve. These could take the form of big bets on new technical, strategic and 
market opportunities that capture value and reduce environmental impact.

Strengthening the ESG organization structure 
A sturdy ESG organization structure allows for combining projects from traditionally non-priority 
functions such as CSR, HR and SHE (Safety, Health and Environment) under a single ESG transformation 
office and empowers them to drive change.

To successfully operationalize efforts, companies could develop new capabilities at a transformational 
scale, including hiring expert talent and upskilling existing staff and acting on sustainability-related 
challenges. Companies could also create a task force of process optimization and sustainability 
specialists to help site teams drive rapid improvement and sustain, expand, and re-strategize efforts as 
a project evolves. Once such a structure is set up, they could adapt targets, performance metrics, and 
decision-making processes across the organization to ensure employees are motivated and supported 
to achieve clean energy goals.

Accelerating India’s sustainability journey in chemicalsIt is also crucial to incorporate an execution focus by setting up a transformation office architecture. 
For example, appointing a chief sustainability officer (CSO), who reports to the CEO, to own and drive the 
transformation journey independently. 

The chemicals industry can improve its ESG performance overall, as several chemical companies have 
shown. Defining an ESG strategy to embrace sustainable practices, implementing necessary changes 
in energy-intensive operations and using enablers to execute said strategies could help transform this 
dynamic industry into a clean energy hub that serves as an example for the rest of the world. Pictured 
below (Exhibit 8) is an overarching framework that CXOs could adopt to design their ESG strategy.

Accelerating India’s sustainability journey in chemicals4. Conclusion

The race to clean energy is underway, influenced heavily by shifting consumer choices and growing 
awareness around sustainability and climate change. Several chemical companies in the country are 
interested in adapting to these changing times, but formidable technical and economic barriers have 
stopped them at the starting line itself.

Achieving such a transition could be complicated, demanding collective action across the industry 
versus individual efforts. Executives could start with adopting a transformation mindset, articulating a 
north star for their future and developing a plan to get there. They should also aim to adopt an execution 
bias and use enablers, whether in the form of innovative technology, or the right talent, to make their 
vision for sustainability a reality.

Courageous leadership will further rethink their long-term strategic positioning, adapt existing 
portfolios, identify growth opportunities emerging from the disruption, and place big bets on long-term 
initiatives that put sustainability at the heart of next-gen strategy.
