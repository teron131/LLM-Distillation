Fintechs: A new paradigm of growthExecutive summary

Over the past decade, technological progress and innovation have catapulted the fintech 
sector from the fringes to the forefront of financial services. And the growth has been fast and 
furious, buoyed by the robust growth of the banking sector, rapid digitization, changing customer 
preferences, and increasing support of investors and regulators. During this decade, fintechs  
have profoundly reshaped certain areas of financial services with their innovative, differentiated,  
and customer-centric value propositions, collaborative business models, and cross-skilled and  
agile teams.

As of July 2023, publicly traded fintechs represented a market capitalization of $550 billion, a two-
times increase versus 2019.1 In addition, as of the same period, there were more than 272 fintech 
unicorns, with a combined valuation of $936 billion, a sevenfold increase from 39 firms valued at 
$1 billion or more five years ago.2  

In 2022, a market correction triggered a slowdown in this explosive growth momentum. The impact 
continues to be felt today. Funding and deal activity have declined across the board, and there 
are fewer IPOs and SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) listings, as well as a decline in 
new unicorn creation. The macro environment also remains challenging and uncertain. In such a 
scenario, fintechs are entering a new era of value creation. The last era was all about firms being 
experimental—taking risks and pursuing growth at all costs. In the new era, a challenged funding 
environment means fintechs can no longer afford to sprint. To remain competitive, they must run at a 
slower and steadier pace.

In this report, we examine how fintechs can continue to grow in strength and relevance for customers, 
the overall financial ecosystem, and the world economy, even in disruptive times. Based on research 
and interviews with more than 100 founders, fintech and banking executives, investors, and senior 
ecosystem stakeholders, we have identified key themes shaping the future of fintechs. To help 
fintechs capitalize on these themes, we also provide a framework for sustainable growth, based on an 
analysis of the strategies used by long-established public companies that have weathered previous 
economic cycles.

Fintechs: A new paradigm of growthChapter 1: Fintech 
growth then and now

The fintech industry raised record capital in the second half of the last decade. Venture capital (VC) 
funding grew from $19.4 billion in 2015 to $33.3 billion in 2020, a 17 percent year-over-year increase 
(see sidebar “What are fintechs?”). Deal activity increased in tandem, with the number of deals 
growing 1.2 times over this period.

The industry fared even better in 2021, thriving on the backs of the pandemic-triggered acceleration 
in digitization and a financial system awash with liquidity. Funding increased by 177 percent year over 
year to $92.3 billion, and the number of deals grew by 19 percent. 

The funding surge proved to be a one-off event. Funding levels in 2022 returned to long-term trend levels 
as inflated growth expectations from the 2021 extraordinary results were reanchored to business-as-
usual levels, and as deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical shocks destabilized the 
business environment. The correction caused fintech valuations to plummet. Many private firms faced 
down rounds, and publicly traded fintechs lost billions of dollars in market capitalization. VC funding was 
hit hard globally and across sectors, dropping to $459.6 billion in 2022 from $683.1 billion in 2021. Fintech 
funding faced a 40 percent year-over-year funding decline, down from $92 billion to $55 billion. Yet, when 
analyzed over a five-year period, fintech funding as a proportion of total VC funding remained fairly stable 
at 12 percent, registering only a 0.5 percentage point decline in 2022. 

Looking ahead, the fintech industry continues to face a challenging future, but there are several 
opportunities yet to be unlocked. Investors are adapting to a new financial paradigm with higher 
interest rates and inflation, which has altered their assessment of risk and reward. At the same 
time, the once-in-a-generation technology revolution under way is generating more value creation 
opportunities. Our research shows that revenues in the fintech industry are expected to grow almost 
three times faster than those in the traditional banking sector between 2022 and 2028. Compared 
with the 6 percent annual revenue growth for traditional banking, fintechs could post annual revenue 
growth of 15 percent over the next five years. 

These trends are also coinciding with—and in many ways catalyzing—the maturation of the fintech 
industry. Based on our research and interviews, three themes will shape the next chapter of fintech 
growth. First, fintechs will continue to benefit from the radical transformation of the banking 
industry, rapid digital adoption, and e-commerce growth around the world, particularly in developing 
economies. Second, despite short-term pressures, fintechs still have room to achieve further growth 
in an expanding financial-services ecosystem. And finally, not all fintechs are being hit equally hard 
during the market correction: fintechs in certain verticals and at particular stages of growth are more 
resilient than their peers. 

What are fintechs?

We define fintech players as start-ups 
and growth companies that rely primarily on 
technology to conduct fundamental functions 
provided by financial services, thereby 
affecting how users store, save, borrow, invest, 

move, pay, and protect money. For the analysis 
of this report, we included the following 
fintech sectors: daily banking; lending; wealth 
management; payments; investment banking 
and capital markets; small and medium-size 

enterprise (SME) and corporate services; 
operations; and infrastructure (including 
embedded finance, and banking as a service). 
The analysis excluded cryptocurrency, 
decentralized finance, and insurtech.

McKinsey’s research shows that 
revenues in the fintech industry are 
expected to grow almost three times 
faster than those in the traditional 
banking sector between 2023 and 2028.

Radical transformation of the banking industry 

Banking is facing a future marked by fundamental restructuring. As our colleagues wrote recently, 
banks and nonbanks are competing to fulfill distinct customer needs in five cross-industry arenas 
in this new era: everyday banking, investment advisory, complex financing, mass wholesale 
intermediation, and banking as a service (BaaS).3  

At the same time, macro tailwinds are powering the growth of fintechs and the broader financial-
services ecosystem. Digital adoption is no longer a question but a reality: around 73 percent of the 
world’s interactions with banks now take place through digital channels. 

Moreover, retail consumers globally now have the same level of satisfaction and trust in fintechs as 
they have with incumbent banks.4 In fact, 41 percent of retail consumers surveyed by McKinsey in 
2021 said they planned to increase their fintech product exposure. The demand—and need—for 
fintech products is higher across developing economies. In 2022, for example, Africa had almost 
800 million mobile accounts, almost half of the whole world’s total.5  

B2B firms’ demand for fintech solutions also is growing. In 2022, 35 percent of the small and 
medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in the United States considered using fintechs for lending, better 
pricing, and integration with their existing platforms. And in Asia, 20 percent of SMEs leveraged 
fintechs for payments and lending.6  

To capitalize on this demand, fintechs will need to keep up with fast-evolving regulations and ensure 
they have adequate resources and capacity to comply. Some European Union member states, 
such as Ireland, are bringing buy-now-pay-later providers under the scope of financial regulation.7 
Meanwhile, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau aims to issue a proposed rule around open 
banking this year that would require financial institutions to share consumer data upon consumers’ 
requests.8 This would make it necessary for fintechs to ensure they have the available resources and 
capacity to respond to these requests. 

A nascent industry in an expanding ecosystem

The banking industry generated more than $6.5 trillion in revenues in 2022, with year-over-year 
growth in volume and revenue margins.9 Given the fintech market dynamics, this suggests there is 
still plenty of room for further growth in both public and private markets.

Fintechs: A new paradigm of growthIn 2022, fintechs accounted for 5 percent (or $150 billion to $205 billion) of the global banking 
sector’s net revenue,10 according to our analysis. We estimate this share could increase to more than 
$400 billion by 2028,11 representing a 15 percent annual growth rate of fintech revenue between 
2022 and 2028, three times the overall banking industry’s growth rate of roughly 6 percent (Exhibit 1).

Emerging markets will fuel much of this revenue growth. Fintech revenues in Africa, Asia–Pacific 
(excluding China), Latin America, and the Middle East represented 15 percent of fintech’s global

other hand, North America, currently accounting for 48 percent of worldwide fintech revenues, is 
expected to decrease its share to 41 percent by 2028.

While fintech penetration in emerging markets is already the highest in the world, its growth potential 
is underscored by a few trends. Many of these economies lack access to traditional banking services 
and have a high share of underbanked population. Fintechs have had some success in addressing 
these unmet needs. In Brazil, for example, 46 percent of the adult population is said to be using 
Nubank, a fintech bank in Latin America—double the share two years ago.12 

Moreover, while the market cap of private fintech companies has increased substantially over the 
past decade, the sector’s penetration of the public market remains small.13 In the eight years leading 
up to October 2022, 44 modern fintechs (those that were founded in 1999 or later and went public 
after 2014) did an IPO, creating a combined market cap of $0.3 trillion. In contrast, during the same 
period, there were more than 2,500 legacy public financial-services companies (whose average year 
of founding was 1926) with a combined market cap of $11.1 trillion.14

Last year was turbulent for fintechs, but there were differences in the fundraising performance of 
firms based on maturity and segments. 

Maturity stage
Companies in the growth stage (series C and beyond) showed the highest sensitivity to last year’s 
funding downturn, with a sharp year-over-year funding decline of 50 percent. Meanwhile, fintechs 
in the early seed and pre-seed stages were more resilient and increased funding by 26 percent year 
over year (Exhibit 2). This funding outperformance of firms in the early and pre-seed stages was a

of economic uncertainty and recover any losses before an eventual sale.

Verticals
Funding for B2B fintech segments last year was more resilient than for those in B2C, with smaller 
funding declines (Exhibit 3). The two B2B verticals that were least affected were (1) BaaS and 
embedded finance and (2) SME and corporate value-added services. These two verticals recorded 
year-over-year funding declines of 24 and 26 percent, respectively. In contrast, funding for 
payments-focused fintechs dropped 50 percent. Even then, payments and lending received the 
largest shares of total fintech funding. 

Funding for B2B segments grew at more than 25 percent annually between 2018 and 2022, driven by 
an increasing number of businesses adopting off-the-shelf solutions provided by digital-native firms 
(including payments, open banking, and core banking technology) to address challenges arising from 
using legacy banking infrastructure—for example, limited flexibility, slower speed, and high costs.

Many businesses continue to rely on legacy banking infrastructure that limits flexibility and speed 
and can often be more costly. To address these challenges, businesses are benefiting from using off-
the-shelf solutions provided by digital natives for services such as payments, open banking, and core 
banking technology. 

For BaaS and embedded finance, demand is led by customer-facing businesses looking to control 
their users’ end-to-end experience. Meanwhile, SMEs have been underserved by traditional 
financial-services providers, despite the fact they represent about 90 percent of businesses and 
more than 50 percent of employment worldwide.15 And in developing countries, the finance gap for 
micro, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSME) is estimated to be approximately $5 trillion, or 1.3 
times the current level of MSME lending.16 Fintech firms have successfully addressed some of SMEs’ 
needs worldwide, especially in developing countries.

Fintechs: A new paradigm of growthChapter 2: The path to 
sustainable growth

The current churn in the markets makes it prudent for fintechs to define their next move carefully. 
After all, they are operating in a much different environment than in years past. In their hypergrowth 
stage, fintechs had access to capital that allowed them to be bold in their business strategy. They 
could make revenue generation their foremost objective; profits were expected to follow. 

The narrative has shifted since last year. The time between funding rounds for fintechs increased 
by more than five months from the first to the fourth quarter of 2022. The average value of funding 
rounds decreased by 50 percent over the same period.17 These changes are forcing fintechs to find 
newer ways to extend runways and adjust their operating models to make decreasing amounts of 
cash last longer.

The days of growth at any cost are behind the industry, for now at least. In a liquidity-constrained 
environment, fintechs and their investors are emphasizing profitability, not just growth in customer 
adoption numbers or total revenues. “In the past, the reward went to fintechs that showed growth at 
all costs, which led to healthy valuations,” said one Africa-based growth equity investor. “Now it is 
about the sustainability of the business, the addressable market, and profitability.”

So how can fintechs get on a path of sustainable, profitable growth? 

In 2019, McKinsey conducted an in-depth study of the growth patterns and performance of the 
world’s 5,000 largest public companies over the preceding 15 years. The researchers’ analysis 
identified ten rules for value-creating growth.18 According to the research, companies that set growth 
strategies addressing all available pathways to growth were 97 percent more likely to achieve above-
peer profitable growth.19 

This set of rules adopted by public companies that have lived through economic cycles and periods of 
uncertainty can also be useful for fintechs as they transition to a sustainable growth model. Based on 
our analysis of these rules and interviews with more than 40 fintech industry leaders, we expect four 
pathways to deliver the most impact for fintechs. 

In a liquidity-constrained environment, 
fintechs and their investors are 
emphasizing profitability, not 
just growth in customer adoption 
numbers or total revenues.

Fintechs: A new paradigm of growth 
Cost discipline 

When fintechs had access to abundant cash and funding was easy, they placed more emphasis 
on growing rapidly than on managing costs. Targeted cost savings have become a bigger priority 
today, as fintechs seek ways to lower expenses and achieve profitability while maintaining customer 
satisfaction and pursuing customer growth and acquisition. Our research has found that 50 percent 
of public fintechs (following their IPO) were profitable in 2022. And the key differentiator between 
profitable and nonprofitable fintechs was cost management, not revenue growth (Exhibit 4). While 
both categories recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 13 percent, profitable fintechs posted a 
median 3 percent decrease in costs. Nonprofitable fintechs, in contrast, saw costs rise by 27 percent, 
which affected their profit margins. 

Successful implementation of cost management efforts is the key for fintechs in their next phase of 
evolution. Several leaders are already making moves: 60 percent of our survey respondents said their 
firms are significantly managing costs. An executive at an African mobile payments firm said they are 
now negotiating every cost and making sure the firm is thinking for the long run.

Consider the example of the Indian fintech company Paytm, which specializes in digital payments and 
financial services. The firm had had a target of achieving breakeven by September 2023 but was able 
to achieve this six months ahead of schedule. It did so through disciplined cost management, revenue 
growth across businesses, and a business model with strong operating leverage.20 

While fintechs establish a clear focus on costs, they should also consider adjusting how they operate, 
thereby creating a more agile and flexible organization that can deal with the current environment. 
Around 80 percent of the interviewed fintechs report that they are currently making changes to 
their operating models. Of these, 66 percent cite a focus on profitability and a sustainable cost 
structure as being among their top three reasons. Such adjustments to the operating model are most 
sustainable when institutions also reinforce the control functions to protect customers and stay on 
top of regulatory changes. 

A shift from hypergrowth to sustainable growth would also result in a greater focus on strong unit 
economics. To do this, fintechs ensure that the profitability view is embedded across the business. 
For example, assessment of the value of adding new customers would evolve from efficiency-only 
metrics such as the customer acquisition cost (CAC) to a more holistic approach. In this example, one

Fintechs: A new paradigm of growthway to embed profitability into acquisition investment and decision making is to compare the CAC 
with the projected lifetime value (LTV) of a customer, using the LTV/CAC ratio to assess the marginal 
return on investment for acquiring every new customer. In Latin America, for example, 68 percent 
of fintechs self-reported an LTV/CAC greater than five, which indicates a potential for fintechs to 
increase spending and further fuel growth without sacrificing profitability.

Measured growth 

As leaders develop growth strategies, an important question is where growth should come from. 
Fintechs can grow sustainably by taking three steps: building a strong core, expanding into adjacent 
industries and geographies, and shrinking to grow. Identifying which steps will be most accretive to 
growth will depend on the unique circumstances of each fintech; some might find value in pursuing 
all three steps, while others could choose to focus on one. Regardless of the circumstances, this 
decision will have greater longer-term consequences in the current environment, compared with the 
earlier high-funding phase. 

Focus on building a strong core as a precursor for expansion
The first step in cracking the growth code involves focusing on the local market and developing a 
healthy core business. According to our research, companies that focus on their core business and 
have a strong home market are 1.6 times more likely to generate peer-beating returns.21 

For fintechs, the key will be to relentlessly focus on growth in their core business. As a North 
American fintech executive told us: “It’s a bit of back to basics. On a core product or offering, 18 to 24 
months ago, you would have built additional pieces on it to upsell and cross-sell. Now, we’re looking to 
double down on the core business and make sure it’s a stable, viable operation.”

To do this, fintechs must tailor their value propositions to their focus markets. Let’s take the 
example of B2C fintechs. Our recent research (McKinsey’s Retail Banking Consumer Survey and 
Global Banking Pools) quantified the potential drivers for growth at B2C fintechs. Cross-selling 
will likely drive growth for fintechs in emerging economies, while those in developed countries will 
likely see greater growth from capturing new customers. Around 72 percent of revenue growth for 
companies in Brazil, for example, is expected to come from cross-selling, in contrast with 25 percent 
and 30 percent for the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively, with the remaining 
growth coming from new customers (Exhibit 5). There is arguably less potential for new-customer 
development in developing economies, given their high fintech penetration.

Across the competitive landscape, as markets are highly heterogenous, a dedicated strategy for each 
region is recommended. For example, our analysis found that in the United Kingdom and the United 
States, fintech revenue share is split almost equally between incumbent digital banks and pure 
fintech players. In contrast, digital incumbents in Germany and pure fintech players in Brazil could 
dominate banking’s revenue share in their respective markets. 

Expand into adjacent segments and geographies
After building a strong core, fintechs can consider expanding into other segments and geographies 
as a second source of growth. According to our previously published research,  companies that do so 
are 1.2 to 1.3 times more likely to generate sizable returns than peers that focus solely on their core.22 

Today, however, expansion is no longer a must-do strategy. It may be most advantageous for 
companies that have strong footholds in their core markets and can use some competitive or 
ownership advantage to expand elsewhere. The key is to pursue measured, value-creating growth. 
A case in point is OPay, which started as a mobile money platform in Nigeria and has since expanded 
across financial-services verticals. OPay now offers peer-to-peer payments and merchant and  
card services.

Shrink to grow
Fintechs are moving from hypergrowth to sustainable growth, but that growth may not necessarily 
be consistent across all parts of the business. If fintechs divest from underperforming parts of their 
portfolios and scale back from regions recording limited growth, they can reinvest that capital into 
high-performing segments—a strategy we call “shrinking to grow.” In our research, companies that 
use this approach are 1.4 times more likely to outperform their peers.

“In the past, many fintechs expanded geographically, even if it didn’t make much sense,” an executive 
at a Latin American fintech told us. “Now they will have to focus on their profitable segment and 
geography and stop expanding where they are not.” 

Some fintechs have been deliberate about using a shrink-to-grow strategy, changing track if an 
expansion strategy did not materialize as expected or the local market had more potential for 
growth. German robo-adviser Scalable Capital, for example, announced plans to discontinue

Financial Services Act in Switzerland would have required the company to manage two regulatory 
frameworks simultaneously. Meanwhile, Wealthsimple, a Canadian online investment platform, 
exited from the United Kingdom and the United States in 2021 to concentrate on its local retail 
market and expand its product portfolio into new financial-services areas. Similarly, in late 2020, 
San Francisco–based fintech LendingClub shut down its retail peer-to-peer platform called Notes 
to focus on other products.

Programmatic M&A 

Many companies will conclude they can achieve the steps outlined in this report—launching new 
features, building new capabilities, and pivoting toward new revenue streams and segments—
more swiftly through thoughtful acquisitions and partnerships than by relying on pure organic 
development. Fintech firm Block, for example, completed its acquisition of the buy-now-pay-later 
platform Afterpay in January 2022 to accelerate its strategic priorities for its seller and cash app 
ecosystems.23 Nearly 60 percent of fintech executives in our survey told us they are considering an 
acquisition in the next 18 months. 

Moreover, with IPO and SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) activity slowing considerably 
since last year, many fintechs that might otherwise go public are turning to private markets for 
funding. Take the example of the British fintech Zopa, which intended to list by 2022 but eventually 
decided to put IPO plans on hold in response to challenging market conditions. In the interim, the firm 
has been raising capital from its shareholders, including $92 million in February.24  

M&A transactions increase significantly during periods of economic uncertainty, when they also 
tend to deliver higher returns. During the global financial crisis, around 45 percent of banking M&A 
deals showed positive excess two-year total shareholder returns (TSR) between 2007 and 2009.25 
In comparison, less than 30 percent of banking deals posted positive excess two-year TSR between 
2010 and 2020.26 Across industries, companies actively making acquisitions worth 10 percent or 
more of their market cap in total had an average TSR of 6.4 percent between January 2007 and 
January 2008, compared with −3.4 percent for the less active companies.27 

However, not all M&As are successful. Many fail to create value due to contrasting values and 
cultures, mismatched product–market fit, and inflated revenue forecasts in the pursuit of customer 
engagement and growth at all costs. 

Keeping the culture alive 

What has made fintechs so disruptive over the years? The answer lies largely in their ability to 
innovate and differentiate. Since fintechs are not as encumbered by legacy systems and processes, 
they can be more agile in using emerging technologies to anticipate and solve customer needs. 
Typically, they also have a customer-centric and collaborative approach to deliver innovation with 
cross-skilled teams. 

Innovations have happened across fintech verticals. Neobanks like Chime and Monzo, designed 
around a simple and intuitive user experience, have changed assumptions about the role of branches 
in traditional retail banking. In the United Kingdom, for example, the total number of bank and building 
society branches fell by 40 percent between 2012 and 2022.28 Robo-advisers such as Wealthfront 
and Nutmeg disrupted the traditional wealth management industry by offering low-cost, accessible 
alternatives to individuals lacking access to personalized financial advice. Funding Circle introduced 
the peer-to-peer lending concept to the financial sector, bypassing traditional banks (which had 
owned this relationship) and enabling direct lending between parties.

Fintechs: A new paradigm of growthIncumbents are fast catching up with these innovations by ramping up investments in new 
technologies. Around 94 percent of banks in a recent survey said they plan to invest more in 
modern payments technology to support end user demand for better payment capabilities over 
the next two to three years. Of these, 65 percent said they intend to make significant or moderate 
levels of investment.29 Many incumbents are also partnering with BaaS platforms to overhaul their 
digital capabilities. Examples include Fifth Third Bank’s acquisition of Rize Money in May 2023  
and NatWest Group’s partnership with Vodeno Group in October 2022 to create a BaaS business 
in the United Kingdom.

To retain their competitive advantage, fintechs must continue to innovate. The next big disruptor 
is always around the corner. Technologies like generative AI are predicted to revolutionize the 
competitive landscape of finance over the next decade (see sidebar “Generative AI and the future 
of banking”). WeBank’s CFO Arthur Wang is one executive who appreciates the urgency. He told 
us, “Even though our bank has been around for almost eight years, we consider ourselves a start-
up. We’re always exploring better fintech technology. WeBank’s strategy is to provide better, more

Generative AI and the future of banking

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are 
increasingly integral to the world we live  
in, and investors are taking notice. 
Generative AI is among the advanced 
technologies for which investments 
are accelerating, thanks to its potential 
to transform business. According to 
McKinsey research published in June 2023, 
generative AI could add the equivalent of 
$2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across 
as many as 63 use cases. 

Generative AI’s impact on the banking 
industry will be significant, delivering 
benefits beyond existing applications of AI in 
areas such as marketing. As our colleagues 
have written, this technology could generate 
an additional $200 billion to $340 billion 
annually in value, arising from around 2.8 to 
4.7 percent increase in the productivity of 
banking’s annual revenues—if the use cases 
are fully implemented.1 For fintech, we expect 
a commensurate impact, if not more, given 
the already high exposure to tech.

Generative AI’s impact—and resulting 
reinvention—will span three broad categories: 

1.  Automation. Half of today’s work 

activities could be automated between 
2030 and 2060, according to McKinsey 
estimates.2 Fintech firm Intuit, for 
example, has introduced a generative 
AI operating system on its platform. 
Its custom-trained  large language 
financial models specialize in solving 
tax, accounting, cash flow, and personal 
finance challenges, among others.3 

2.  Augmenting and enhancing productivity 

to do work more effectively. Generative 
AI could enable labor productivity 
growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually 
through 2040, depending on the rate of 
technology adoption and redeployment 
of workers’ time to other activities. 
Morgan Stanley is building an AI assistant 
using GPT-4 to help the organization’s 
wealth managers quickly find and 
synthesize answers from a massive 
internal knowledge base.4 

3.  Acceleration. Organizations can  
use generative AI to extract and  
index knowledge to shorten  
innovation cycles, thereby enabling 
continuous innovation.

To capture these opportunities, fintechs 
need an ecosystem of capabilities and 
partners that will allow them to move 
fast. First movers will accrue competitive 
advantage as they build their capabilities and 
mobilize with a focus on value, rather than 
rushing to deliver pilots. To do this, fintechs 
should consider investing more in people and 
change management, given generative AI’s 
unique potential to influence the future of 
work. Fintechs could think about developing 
a medium- to longer-term talent strategy and 
find ways to emphasize change management 
and adoption. Fintechs that delay building 
their capabilities risk becoming the disrupted 
instead of the disruptors.

with leading technology. We do business 100 percent online, so we rely on technology.”30 

A tight labor market has also made it more challenging for fintechs to attract and hire tech talent. 
Our survey uncovered a shift in the perception of fintechs as riskier employers. As a Europe-based 
fintech executive told us: “Fintechs are less attractive now because it is clearer that it is a ‘high risk’ 
job compared with established institutions. On the other hand, large fintechs are laying off, which can 
create a new pool of talents to attract.” 

In such an environment, fintechs must work toward strengthening their culture and mission and, 
consequently, their hiring strategy. One European payments fintech, for example, has differentiated 
strategies based on the profile of open roles. An executive at the firm says it has been easier to 
recruit people for junior roles, since these workers are more eager to join a growing organization. “It is 
a different story with experienced profiles—for example, management team or 35-plus years—where 
recruiting is more difficult and retention is crucial,” he said. To attract such people, the firm offers 
stock options and other incentive packages. Meanwhile, an Africa-based payments and remittances 
fintech casts a more global net: “We hire globally, regardless of location, gender, or race,” an 
executive told us. “We have no quotas and try to just find the best person for each role.”

The fintech industry is undergoing a sea change, so players will have to evolve to survive. Approaches 
will vary, depending on each fintech’s maturity level and its vertical and geographic focus. The 
framework for sustainable growth, described in this report, provides a strong foundation:

1.  Measured growth based on a stable core. Ensure there is a strong and stable core business with 
a targeted and proven market fit before expanding, rather than trying to grow while strengthening 
the core.

2.  Programmatic M&A. Pursue M&A strategically and establish mutually beneficial partnerships 

based on a programmatic strategy rooted in value sharing (with incumbents and other fintechs), 
as opposed to pursuing M&A only as a response to a low-valuation environment.

3.  Cost discipline. Control costs to withstand the new funding environment while remaining flexible, 

nimble, and compliant.

4.  Keep the culture alive. Maintain the agility, innovation, and culture that have been the bedrock of 

disruption so far. 

Decisions taken today will likely set the pace for fintechs over the mid to long term. The present 
conditions therefore call for a careful evaluation and focused implementation.
