Foreword

For the European grocery sector, 2023 was all about inflation—again. European food price 
inflation averaged 12.8 percent in 2023, reaching its highest level since the end of the Second 
World War. While unfavorable market conditions put a strain on consumer wallets and margins 
are pressured by rising costs, there are signs of hope: inflation has stabilized, real wages are 
recovering, and fewer consumers indicate an intent to trade down, with some groups even 
inclined to trade up.

This report examines the most prevalent trends that will influence the grocery industry in 2024 
and beyond. How can grocers mitigate further cost increases and improve their margins? Will 
uptrading return and propel grocery sales again? What does the future hold for food to go? 
Will sustainability targets be reached on time? What needs to happen for players to get ahead 
in the online grocery market? How can grocers develop retail media businesses that support 
profitability reliably? Where should grocers invest in AI and advanced analytics to achieve the 
highest impact? Finally, in a world of tight labor markets, how can grocery retailers attract and 
retain the right talent for future growth?

The State of Grocery Europe is an annual publication. This year’s report, Signs of Hope—The 
State of Grocery Retail 2024: Europe, is a continuation of a partnership between McKinsey and 
EuroCommerce, and it is designed to provide executives with a comprehensive view of the 
market and future trends. In preparing the report, we surveyed more than 12,000 consumers 
across 11 European countries and more than 30 grocery executives from more than 15 countries 
across Europe. In addition, we interviewed four grocery CEOs. We combined EuroCommerce’s 
policy and sector knowledge with McKinsey’s global expertise and analytical rigor.

We hope this report will offer new insights and perspectives to help grocers navigate ongoing 
uncertainties and take advantage of future growth opportunities.

Signs of Hope

For the European grocery industry, 2023 was a challenging year. Inflation led consumers to 
tighten their belts, leading to a drop in volume and significant downtrading. As a result, industry 
growth was significantly below food price inflation. Food price inflation in Europe was 12.8 
percent in 2023,1 while grocery sales grew at a rate of only 8.6 percent.2 Discounters and private 
labels benefited from this market environment and were yet again the winners of the year.

In 2024, we expect macroeconomic uncertainty to persist, but at the same time, our research 
indicates the first small signs of recovery. The pressure on margins, costs, and prices remains a 
key concern for grocery retail CEOs, but leaders are less pessimistic than they were in previous 
years. In addition, thanks to initial signs of economic recovery and wage increases in many 
countries, consumer confidence is returning. Still, our consumer research shows that recovery 
of consumer behavior is very polarized for 2024. While most consumer segments are still price 
sensitive and trading down, some segments show an increased appetite for uptrading and 
innovations.

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: Europe2023: Again all about price
Grocery sales in Europe3 grew by 8.6 percent in 2023. 
This growth was a result of 12.8 percent food price 
inflation, a downtrading effect of 1.8 percent, and a 2.0 
percent volume decline. This implies that grocery sales 
in real terms (that is, adjusted for inflation) declined 
again in 2023 and are now 4.5 percent below 2019 lev-
els. This decrease from 2019 is driven by a small volume 
increase of 0.3 percent and a decline of the price per 
item in real terms by 4.8 percent.

While inflation eased significantly over the course of 
2023, it was still the dominant factor affecting the indus-
try. Overall inflation came down from a historic high of 
10 percent in October 2022 to a stable 3 percent at the 
end of 2023. European food price inflation was even 
higher, reaching a 19.0 percent peak in March 2023 
and an average of 12.8 percent for the full year. Pro-
ducer prices in the European Union started to decline 
in early 2023, following agricultural prices with a delay 
of six months. Food prices for consumers saw minimal 
decline at the time, in part because grocery retailers’ 
price contracts with suppliers remain in effect and labor 
costs increased significantly.4

Real wages were compressed during 2022 and most of 
2023. This has put severe pressure on many household 
budgets and curbed consumer purchasing power. 
Wage increases of 6.3 percent in the EU-27 in the 
second half of 2023 brought some relief for consumers, 
but not all countries returned to 2019 wage levels in real 
terms. For instance, real wages are still below 2019 lev-
els in France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. On 
average, real wages in the EU-27 were 1.2 percentage 
points below 2019 levels at the end of 2023.5

As a result, consumers traded down significantly in 
2023, and private labels and discounters benefited. 
The private label share increased substantially by 1.8 
percentage points, to 38.0 percent of sales in 2023 
from 36.2 in 2022 (see “Food and grocery market KPIs 
in 2023,” page 25). Discounters gained another 0.8 
percentage points in market share on average, and at 
least 1.0 percentage point in Belgium, Germany, Poland, 
Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The overall market 
share of supermarkets remained stable at 37.2 percent 
in Europe. Supermarkets in Italy, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, and Spain found strategies to succeed despite 
high price pressure and even achieved market share

remained stable at 6 percent of total grocery sales, with 
significant differences among countries. France had the 
highest online gain with 0.5 percentage points, while 
the online channel lost market share in Sweden (–1.2 
percentage points), the United Kingdom (–0.7), and 
Italy (–0.5), as well as in Belgium, the Netherlands, and

With inflation easing toward the end of the year, the de-
velopment of the grocery market also improved. Down-
trading and declines in volume slowed from quarter to 
quarter and came close to zero in the fourth quarter of 
2023 (Exhibit 1).

Our data shows signs of hope for 2024. While the first 
few months of 2024 may still be challenging as the 
economy contends with the aftereffects of high infla-
tion, the fundamentals are slowly improving. Overall 
inflation is expected to stabilize around 2 percent, with 
food inflation slightly below in the short to medium 
term. Real wages are expected to grow. Grocery volume 
stopped decreasing toward the end of 2023 and even 
started to increase in some markets. In addition, in our 
survey, consumers tell us that they plan to trade down 
less than they did in 2023, and a few consumer groups 
even intend to start trading up again (Exhibit 2). If this 
trend holds, we expect grocery volume in Europe to 
return to growth in the second half of 2024.

Our data also shows large differences among countries 
and consumer segments. In some countries, includ-
ing Germany, consumers report a strong intention 
to reduce downtrading and to start trading up again 
selectively. In other markets, consumers are still less 
optimistic about the future (for example, in Italy and 
Switzerland). We therefore expect market performance 
in Europe in 2024 to be quite heterogenous, with sig-
nificant differences between countries. We expect the 
same to be true for consumer segments. For example, 
low-income households are still trading down, while 
high-income households intend to trade up again on 
specific occasions or in selected categories.

Grocery CEOs remain concerned—although less so than 
last year. Seventy-six percent of European grocery retail 
CEOs in our survey remain concerned about challeng-
ing market conditions (Exhibit 3). Thirty-six percent 
expect market conditions to become worse than in the 
prior year (down from 44 percent in 2023 and 60 per-
cent in 2022), while 40 percent expect them to remain 
the same (up from 33 percent in 2023). CEOs are par-
ticularly concerned about prices and inflation. That said, 
CEOs in Central and Eastern Europe are somewhat less 
pessimistic than their peers in Western Europe. Only 29 
percent of Central and Eastern European CEOs expect 
market conditions to become worse, compared with 50 
percent in Western Europe.

The 2024 grocery CEO agenda remains similar to last 
year’s. Increased margin pressure and downtrading 
take the top two positions again, well ahead of other 
priorities (Exhibit 4). However, four priorities gained 
between seven and 12 ranks compared to last year: 
talent, food to go, government regulations, and loyalty 
programs.

Based on our CEO and consumer surveys and further 
research, we identified eight trends that we believe will 
shape the grocery industry in 2024. Some of the trends 
build on last year’s, while others are new and will shape 
the strategies required to win in the grocery industry in 
the coming years (see “Key trends,” page 13).

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeCost and margin pressure

The profitability of grocers declined 
further in 2023, and the pressure will 
not go away in 2024.
Margins decreased for both grocery retailers and con-
sumer packaged goods (CPG) companies between 2019 
and 2022. While grocery retailers lost 0.4 percentage 
points of EBITDA margin in that period, CPG compa-
nies lost 1.3 points. However, 2023 followed a different 
trajectory. Retailers were losing another 0.3 percentage 
points because of additional cost increases, while CPG 
companies gained back 0.8 percentage points as they 
passed their cost increases on to retailers (Exhibit 5).

In 2024, grocery retailers will continue to feel margin 
pressure. The main driver in 2024 is rising rent and 
labor costs. According to our CEO survey, cost and 

margin pressure is a top three priority for 70 percent of 
CEOs (compared with 67 percent last year).

To improve their margins, retailers are expected to 
intensify supplier negotiations, buying-alliance activity, 
and consolidation efforts in 2024. In 2023, we saw in-
tense supplier negotiations during which some leading 
products were temporarily not available in stores. This 
year we expect to see even more intense negotiations. 
Buying alliances are gaining strength, and selected new 
ones are emerging—such as the recently announced 
partnership between Auchan and Intermarché. “This 
will be a real game changer,” Auchan CEO Yves Claude 
told us during an interview (see page 28). Meanwhile, 
M&A activity is expected to stay high as retailers seek 
economies of scale, building on the 2023 record of 21 
transactions in Europe,7 including Reitan’s acquisition of 
the majority of the ALDI store network in Denmark.

Most consumer groups still intend 
to trade down in 2024, while high-
income households are starting to 
trade back up.
More than 45 percent of respondents to our European 
consumer survey said they are still looking for ways to 
save money when shopping in 2024. Still, this num-
ber is lower than it was last year, while it continues 
to be similar across income groups (Exhibit 6). While 
downtrading is still highly prevalent across low-income 
households, we saw initial signs in 2023 that high-in-
come households are uptrading again. The net intent 
of high-income households to buy more high-quality or 
organic products further increased at the beginning of 
2024 and is now clearly positive. We therefore expect 
to see downtrading and uptrading at the same time, 
depending on the consumer group and the geogra-
phy. The consumer survey results vary greatly across 
countries, leading us to expect significant differences in 
market development across Europe.

Private label growth continues and is expected to per-
sist, even if the economy improves. Both private labels 
and discounters experienced strong growth across Eu-
rope, gaining 1.8 and 2.9 percentage points, respectively 
(see “Food and grocery market KPIs in 2023,” page 25),  
and consumers continue to have positive experiences 
with private label offerings. According to our consumer 
survey, 83 percent of consumers rate private label prod-
ucts of equal or better quality than branded options. 
Therefore, we do not expect shoppers to switch back 
even if the market environment improves.

The quest for health and longevity is the only premium-
ization trend that has not been negatively affected by 
inflation. The intent of shoppers to buy healthier prod-
ucts has remained constantly high for several years. 
According to our consumer survey, consumers also 
prioritize products perceived as “good for myself” over 
those “good for the planet.” Functional food claims such 
as “boosting energy” and “supporting health” continue 
to gain traction.

Consumer intent to save money has declined but stays high, with increased 
interest in quality and stable interest in health.

for share of stomach

As consumers spend more time on 
the move, the food-to-go market is 
surging.
The food-to-go market declined during the COVID-19 
pandemic, but it has recovered and continues to grow. 
Food to go encompasses various channels: prepack-
aged ready-to-eat meals, ready-to-heat convenience 
meals, counters and kiosks, restaurant takeaways, and 
meal delivery. The growth of these channels is driven 
by the return of workers to offices and consumers’ in-
creasingly busy lifestyles. According to our CEO survey, 
food to go is one of the top five trends for 2024; CEOs 
expect food to go to drive traffic, raise margins, and 
generate cross-selling opportunities.

Foodservice providers such as restaurants, takeaway 
players, and meal delivery services are gaining share 
from grocery retailers. Despite the inflationary environ-
ment and consumers trading down, the foodservice 
industry outpaced the grocery retail industry by nearly 
three percentage points. While foodservice grew at 
11.5 percent,8 grocery achieved a growth rate of only 
8.6 percent last year. France and Italy now have higher 
foodservice volume compared with prepandemic 

“In Paris, half the population 
now lives alone, so they prefer 
packaged meals and smaller 
portions. Our new concept 
stores will help us gauge the 
demand for ready meals.’”

levels, while Germany and Spain are still below those 
levels.9 Going forward, food to go is expected to grow 
at roughly 8 percent per year over the next five years in 
Europe,10 while the grocery retail market is expected to 
grow at roughly 3 percent.

Grocery retailers are expanding their food-to-go offer-
ings to capture this growth. Grocers are expanding their 
offerings of traditional ready-to-eat, ready-to-heat, and 
ready-to-cook products. They are also increasingly 
experimenting with foodservice offers such as hot food 
to go, cafeterias, and seated restaurants, either through 
third-party concepts or by offering them directly.

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeSustainability: Progress made, 
still a long way to go

A step change for sustainability 
in grocery requires bold actions 
from retailers; our 2024 consumer 
research does not show increasing 
pull from consumers.
In fact, the share of consumers who want to buy prod-
ucts that are more sustainable in the next 12 months 
decreased by one percentage point from 2023. Also, the 
intent to buy more alternative-protein products remains 
stable at the low levels of 2023. Only members of 
Generation Z and millennials signal a high intent to buy 
more environmentally friendly products in 2024.

The window of opportunity to reach 2025 sustainability 
targets is closing. All of the top ten European grocery 
retailers have set sustainability goals for 2025, covering 
a variety of sustainability dimensions (Exhibit 7).11 Many 
of the dimensions still have sizable gaps to close to 
reach these targets. We therefore expect to see acceler-
ated sustainability efforts across the industry in 2024. 
For targets on Scopes 1–3,12 working toward these pres-
ents a dual opportunity to reduce carbon emissions 
and capture cost savings; we have found that, depend-
ing on the category, up to 40 percent of emissions can 
Web 2024>
<MCK241022 SoG Europe Full Report >
Exhibit 7
Exhibit <8> of <11>

be reduced in a way that also reduces cost.

So far, none of the top ten European grocers are re-
porting any progress on Scope 3 emission reductions.13 
This is mainly because measuring these emissions 
accurately is very difficult. However, pioneering retailers 
have started to build Scope 3 accounting capabilities 
that use actual emissions by product and supplier 
instead of global averages across all suppliers. This 
shift will enable grocers to measure and reduce their 
Scope 3 emissions more effectively. For example, by 
understanding the real emissions associated with each 
supplier, grocery retailers can switch to suppliers with 
lower emissions or agree with suppliers on concrete 
reduction targets.

Regenerative agriculture14 could become the new ‘organ-
ic.’ Most of grocery retailers’ greenhouse gas emissions 
are driven by agriculture. About 50 percent are driven 
by dairy and meat alone. Regenerative agricultural 
practices are therefore the key to meet the net-zero 
ambitions proclaimed by many retailers. Introducing 
regenerative agricultural labels in their assortment as 
an alternative to organic labels can be a big opportunity 
for retailers to differentiate their offerings while working 
toward their sustainability targets.

The top ten European grocers are on a final sprint to meet their 2025 goals.

1003322444020403863294329Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeOnline: Liberation from offline

Online grocery is returning to growth, 
and it is increasingly evolving into 
an independent, profitable format 
with its own differentiated value 
proposition.
Online grocery lost market share in 2023, but consumers 
are starting to return as spending power recovers. The 
net intent of consumers to buy more food online has 
returned to positive, increasing by eight percentage 
points in the first quarter of 2024. We expect e-grocery 
to grow faster than the overall grocery market over the 
next years. Meal delivery from restaurants might grow 
even faster than e-grocery (Exhibit 8). Pure players 
in particular show extraordinary growth rates as they 
expand into new regions. For instance, Picnic grew 
at more than 30 percent per annum over the past five 
years,15 driven by rapid expansion.

Pure players are starting to reach profitability. For 
instance, Rohlik is profitable.16 Picnic claims to be “op-
erationally profitable in mature markets,”17 and Ocado 
returned to profitability in 2023. Moreover, leading meal 
delivery players have also reached breakeven (Door-
Dash and Deliveroo over the course of 2023), thanks to 
a successful shift of priorities from growth to rightsiz-
ing.18

Increasingly, consumers expect different value propo-
sitions from online and offline channels. It is becom-
ing progressively clear that the two channels satisfy 
different shopping needs. For example, 37 percent of 
consumers in our UK survey (two percentage points 
higher than 2023) always shop at a different banner 
online than offline because they exhibit different needs 
by channel. In addition, UK consumers see promotions 
as more important than price for offline store selection, 
while for online, price is more important than promo-
tions.

the bottom line

Retail media (RM) undoubtedly 
remains a substantial profit driver for 
grocery retailers, with 20 of Europe’s 
top 30 grocery retailers now active in 
the market.
Grocers view RM as a fundamental driver of profitability. 
In Europe, the RM market was worth €11 billion in 2023 
and is expected to grow at a rate of 15 percent annually 
in the coming years. With EBIT margins reaching 65 to 
70 percent within three years of launching, RM presents 
an attractive opportunity for grocery retailers.19 In our 
survey, grocery retail CEOs confirmed this opportunity, 
naming RM as one of the top five opportunities for the 
year ahead.

2024 will be marked by a bold expansion of retailers’ RM 
footprint. The name of the game for RM is scale—only 
the largest players are expected to remain relevant for 
CPG advertisers in the long run, especially in light of 
Amazon’s large share in the market (Exhibit 9). This 

will prompt smaller players to consolidate and form 
partnerships to maintain relevance in the RM world. 
Alliances, such as the Unlimitail partnership between 
Carrefour and Publicis, and the growth of ad network 
aggregators such as Amazon Ads are expected to 
shape the market this year.

Standardization, impact measurement, and ad diversi-
fication are critical for engaging CPGs on RM. Regula-
tory changes have increased the difficulty of targeted 
digital marketing, boosting the appeal of RM for CPG 
companies to engage with consumers at the point of 
purchase. Transparency and standardization of impact 
metrics, such as return on ad spending, are essential 
for RM success, and CPG companies rank these as the 
top barrier to further investing in RM.20 To address this, 
Ahold Delhaize, for example, has launched a self-ser-
vice platform for suppliers to manage and track the im-
pact of RM campaigns. Moreover, retailers are expected 
to expand their offerings beyond classic paid search 
and website banners to include video, connected TV, 
shoppable (video) content, and innovative in-store acti-
vations in order to stay relevant to CPG advertisers.

The next wave of analytics

Advanced analytics and traditional AI 
still account for most of the impact, 
but conversational commerce 
enabled by generative AI has the 
potential to reimagine how we shop.
Retailers have started to experiment with generative 
AI but have yet to unlock real value. From the total 
advanced analytics and AI impact pool in grocery retail, 
an estimated 10 to 20 percent of value potential stems 
from generative AI. In grocery, six revenue-enhancing 
and efficiency-driving use cases are expected to drive 
value: hyper-personalized content, smart search, co-
pilots for category management (for example, supplier 
negotiations), copilots for support functions (such as 
software development), content creation, and conver-
sational commerce (Exhibit 10). By engaging shoppers 
with a human-like chatbot as a personal shopping 
assistant, conversational commerce can significantly 
improve the on- and offline shopping experience. For 

instance, US-based Walmart launched its Text to Shop 
proposition last year, allowing consumers to shop for 
groceries by texting. They can also get inspiration for 
recipes, make restocking suggestions, and schedule 
delivery or pickup times.

Advanced analytics and traditional AI are still the largest 
sources of technology-driven value creation in retail. 
Eighty to 90 percent of future value creation for grocers 
is driven by advanced analytics and traditional AI. For 
grocers, assortment, pricing, and promotion optimi-
zation are the largest opportunity areas. Rigorously 
leveraging advanced analytics and traditional AI across 
the organization has the potential to improve EBIT mar-
gins in retail by up to one percentage point. Most large 
retailers in Europe have adopted a range of advanced 
analytics use cases by now and started to capture 
a significant share of that potential. The remaining 
opportunity resides in expanding to further use cases, 
increasing adoption of use cases, and using the new 
capabilities to localize and personalize the offering for 
each store and consumer.

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeTalent: Making retail a 
career again

Grocers across Europe face an 
unprecedented number of job 
vacancies, and the average employee 
tenure is shrinking.
Vacancy and fluctuation rates are high. In the third 
quarter of 2023, 2.2 percent of all retail jobs were 
vacant, a 29.4 percent increase from 1.7 percent prior 
to the pandemic.21 While retailers work hard to fill open 
positions, they are also confronted with high turnover 
rates—especially in frontline positions. In addition, there 
is a shortage of skilled talent, particularly in supply 
chain activities, as well as for jobs that require digital 
and technological know-how. The aging of the popu-
lation further exacerbates the situation. The number of 
citizens of working age in the EU-27 will decline by ap-
proximately one million people per year going forward. 
Hiring and developing talent is one of the top three 
priorities of European grocery retail CEOs, according 
to our survey. Yet only 21 percent of retail employers 
in Germany say they have a professional retention 
program in place, and even fewer—11 percent—say they 
have the tools in place to survey employee satisfaction 
regularly.22

As automation and digitalization progress, the roles and 
job profiles of retail employees will change significantly 
over the next decade. Social, emotional, cognitive, and 

technological skills will become more important as 
the need for physical activity decreases. Our analysis 
shows that by 2030, the time workers spend using 
social or emotional abilities will increase by 32 percent, 
and the time they spend leveraging technical skills will 
increase by 64 percent. Physical and manual activity, 
on the other hand, will decline by 17 percent as a result 
of technological advancements.

Attractive grocery employers offer careers, not just jobs, 
in combination with the right work–life balance. Forty 
percent of retail employees in Germany and 33 percent 
of retail employees in the Netherlands are considering 
changing their jobs.23 Respondents cited unmet needs 
of applicants, compensation, and working times among 
the top five factors in ongoing retail vacancies in 
Germany. Flexible work arrangements and a multitude 
of career paths gain in importance. Yet only 16 percent 
of retail employers in Germany say they offer work–life 
benefits to frontline retail employees, and more than 50 
percent of retail employers in Germany say they do not 
offer individual career opportunities to their employees. 
In the United Kingdom, the retail sector ranks in the 
bottom third in terms of offering career progression 
opportunities compared with other sectors. Meanwhile, 
retailers such as Walmart have started acting on these 
developments by offering different types of career paths 
and trainings depending on employee preferences.

Implications for grocers

The state of grocery continues to 
present challenges, but—supported 
by stronger consumer sentiment—
there are opportunities for executives 
to build new sources of competitive 
advantage. We see three strategic 
priorities for grocery retailers that 
will help them strengthen their 
assortments, increase profitability, 
and leverage the momentum for RM 
networks.

Future-proofing the assortment
Confronted with polarized consumer behavior, grocers 
seek to balance affordability with value-adding products 
while rationalizing the assortment to optimize costs. To 
defend their market share, supermarkets and hypermar-
kets will want to keep strengthening their private label 
offerings. At the same time, growing demand for healthy 
products and for food-to-go, ready-to-eat, and ready-to-
heat options provides further opportunities for uptrading 
consumers. Retailers that can differentiate assortment 
by store depending on local needs will be best posi-

tioned to win in this market environment—especially 
given that different countries, regions, and neighbor-
hoods will show varied recoveries in 2024.

Driving nontrivial efficiency savings
As margin and cost pressure remains high, grocery 
retailers need to take rigorous mitigating actions to 
achieve cost savings. With low-hanging fruit already 
captured, cross-functional and nontrivial cost positions 
need to be addressed in 2024—for example, operat-
ing model redesign, end-to-end supply chain opti-
mization from supplier to store, rent renegotiation, or 
design-to-value for private label assortment.

Monetizing retail media
When it comes to building and scaling a RM busi-
ness that drives profits in 2024 and beyond, grocers 
have no time to lose. To go from good to great in RM, 
players need to think like ad agencies and secure the 
right leadership commitment, business autonomy, and 
resources dedicated to RM business development. 
Grocery retailers enjoy a privileged position in today’s 
media landscape. However, to remain relevant to adver-
tisers over time, RM players should consider improving 
their impact measurements, as well as continuously 
enhancing and renewing their advertising offerings.

“The customer 
experience has to be 
grounded in the warmth 
of human interaction.”

Yves Claude 
CEO, Auchan Retail

Auchan employs more than 150,000 people and operates 
more than 2,300 points of sale under the Auchan banner 
in 11 countries.

Q: From your perspective, how did the market conditions for grocery retail evolve in 
2023? And how was business for Auchan?

A: Last year was a challenging one for the industry in multiple respects. The French economy went 
through some difficult times. Things went reasonably well for Auchan during the first three quar-
ters of 2023, but the fourth quarter was more challenging. In addition, our suppliers increased their 
prices significantly, and with only 8 percent market share in France, we don’t have much bargaining 
power. We had to pass on price increases to our customers, and many of them traded away to other 
players.

Q: Did you experience the same challenges in other countries as well?

A: Not as much. In other countries, such as Portugal and Spain, Auchan offers the best prices 
in the market. This is a real advantage in times of high inflation. Some markets have shown 
more resilience, both in terms of sales and in terms of profitability, because consumers there 
are more willing to spend money on groceries. Households in Spain and Portugal have lower 
average incomes than those in France, but shoppers in those countries will still spend money 
on good food. In Spain, we also successfully integrated the Dia stores we acquired in mid-2023, 
subsequent to the acquisition the previous year. That was a big step for us. And in Portugal, we 
signed the acquisition of Dia stores.

Q: What are your thoughts on inflation?

A: In France, inflation dominated the news in 2023, and it put pressure on our profits. Now, as 
inflation slows, the sector can return to more conservative commercial strategies. We ended 
2023 with an overall price increase of 1 to 2 percent. For some products, we will even lower 
prices. Overall, and as with most of our competitors as well, our customers bought much more 
of our private label this past year.

28

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeQ: How has 2024 been so far?

A: We’re off to a challenging start, with strikes and protests that are affecting our supply chains. 
But we also see signs of hope. Thanks to the acquisition of the Dia stores, we will be able to 
double our market share in Portugal in 2024. Another reason for optimism is our ten-year buy-
ing alliance with Intermarché and Casino. This will be a real game changer. Together, we have 
32 percent market share in France. That makes us a force to be reckoned with.

Q: How are shopping habits changing in the markets in which you operate?

A: In Paris, half the population now lives alone, so they prefer packaged meals and smaller 
portions. Our new concept stores will help us gauge the demand for ready meals. We will even 
offer our customers the option to eat these meals on-site. Hypermarkets are still working for 
families or older customers, but a lot of younger people don’t shop there. They prefer to buy 
their groceries close to their home, in a local store with a human touch. So we must improve the 
experience to keep these customers coming into our stores. The customer experience has to be 
grounded in the warmth of human interaction.

Q: What are you doing to promote sustainability?

A: We’re a family business. We take a long-term view. We want to make sure that we are 
responsible. We can’t aspire to please everyone; we aspire to stand up for our values. For exam-
ple, we try to do as much local purchasing as possible. We also want to be long-term partners 
for our suppliers. We have worked with some of them for over 60 years, and we will stand by 
them in the quest for sustainability.

Q: How are your customers responding to your commitment to sustainability?

A: Consumers want healthy food, ideally from local producers, but they are also price con-
scious. We want to offer consumers with smaller budgets quality products that more affluent 
shoppers buy in small local shops. Our purpose is “#vivre mieux” [“#live better”], and it drives 
all our decisions. We want consumers to have food sovereignty. To make this happen, we need 
to communicate clearly about the quality and the origin of the food we sell so consumers can 
make informed choices. Take chicken. Many grocers import chicken from faraway countries 
to get better prices. At Auchan, we sell only French chicken. We shrink our margin to do it. We 
can’t turn the tide alone. It takes a joint effort, including the government, associations, and farm-
ers.

Q: How far along are you on the e-grocery journey?

A: The average Auchan shopper has 30 products in their cart, including heavy packs of bottled 
water, frozen products, and ready meals. That’s a lot of variety, and it’s hard to handle in terms 
of logistics. To make things even more difficult for us, most of our online customers want home 
delivery.

Q: Is click and collect a viable alternative?

A: It could be, but for it to be fully effective, the pickup locations need to be on a consumer’s 
path from their place of work or study to their home. Our current store locations are not always 
ideal for that type of business. 

Q: What about the online experience itself?

A: Customer expectations are very high. They expect a sleek, highly functional website with 
features such as filtering tools, customer reviews, and videos. We don’t have all of that in place 
at this point. So the online purchasing journey isn’t yet as engaging and as seamless as we 
would like it to be. We’re working on it, but we take it one step at a time to get it right. Some 
parts of our assortment, such as textiles, aren’t even available online yet. We will change that 
soon.

29

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeQ: What are your thoughts on format evolution?

A: I don’t think more hypermarkets will open in the countries in which we do business, or at 
least only very few will. Because of changing shopper needs, we expect to see a lot of stores 
with smaller footprints to open in the future, which will restore balance in the market. To partake 
in this development, we are working on a franchise model to build a network of small, indepen-
dent stores run by local entrepreneurs. When we advertised this opportunity internally, many of 
our employees started selling their Auchan shares to free up capital, start their own store, and 
be their own boss. This project is very close to my heart because it’s about empowerment. It’s 
a way for us to give something back to the people who work for us and expand our network at 
the same time. We are also now reducing the size of our hypermarkets.

Q: Looking ahead beyond 2024, what is your top priority? 

A: We will push for growth in the markets in which we are already present, rather than enter 
new territories. Right now, our market share is relatively low in most markets: 8 percent share in 
France, 6 percent in Spain, 5 percent in Romania, 3 percent in Poland. As a result, our volumes 
are too low to command attention from suppliers. For suppliers, volume is key, and they prefer 
exclusivity. Some suppliers shut us out because of this. So growing market share is a priority for 
us. Our aspiration is to reach a double-digit market share in each market. France, Spain, and 
Portugal are our priorities right now, but we will pursue market share growth in other countries 
as well.

“To solve for net zero, 
I expect brand owners 
to address their Scope 1 
and 2 emissions.”

Ole Robert Reitan 
CEO, Reitan Retail

Reitan Retail employs more than 43,000 people and has 
a network of 3,850 grocery, convenience, and mobility 
stations across seven countries, including Norway, 
Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and the Baltic states.

Q: Can you tell our readers a little about the history of your company?

A: My grandfather started it. He opened the first grocery store in Trondheim in 1948, a tradi-
tional store with him as the shopkeeper behind the counter. As the owners of the grocery store, 
my grandparents were at the center of their local community. They knew everyone, from the 
housewives and the schoolteacher to the priest and the soccer coach. My grandfather worked 
behind the counter all his life, and I grew up in his store.

Q: How did that store evolve into the company you manage today?

A: That’s where my father comes in. In 1972, he opened his own store. At the time, he and my 
grandfather had a very intense argument about whether a chain-operated retail model could 
work. My father envisioned a chain of stores. My grandfather thought that was a terrible idea 
and argued it would never work. He was convinced that the owner had to be on the shop floor 
all the time, watching over the customers, the local market, the inventory, the costs—everything.

Q: How did they resolve their disagreement?

A: The pivotal moment was a trip to the United States my father took in the mid-1970s. In 
America, he discovered the franchise system. McDonald’s and Holiday Inn made a big impres-
sion on him. Here was a system that combined the best of both worlds: the accountability of 
owner–operators and the scale of a chain. 

Q: So that was the magic moment?

A: Exactly. It really is a miracle that these two guys with totally different perspectives on life 
and business found common ground after almost a decade of arguing. The next argument was 
around the actual concept. So my father took another trip: in 1977, he went to Germany and met 
the Albrecht brothers, the founders of ALDI. My father was thrilled, and he came home with 
the plan to create the first Norwegian discount concept. He opened the first outlet in 1979 and 
called it REMA 600, with an assortment of 600 SKUs. In 1980, he expanded the assortment to 
1,000 SKUs, paving the way for the REMA 1000 brand.

Q: And it took off right away?

A: It did, thanks to my father’s focus on low costs, low prices, and high turnover. High turnover 
enabled him to reduce costs even further, and he passed the savings on to customers through 
even lower prices that led to even higher sales. It was a strong flywheel. 

31

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeQ: Let’s fast-forward to the present day: what was 2023 like for the Nordic grocery mar-
ket?

A: Inflation was the main topic. Prices increased by as much as 10 percent. That had a big 
impact on the market. In early 2023, it was a “wild West” situation in terms of pricing. Competi-
tion was fierce, and some prices we saw didn’t make sense to me. I just didn’t see how some of 
our competitors could cover their costs with those prices. Later on, it turned out that I was right, 
and things balanced out toward the end of the year.

Q: How did all this affect REMA 1000?

A: The first half of 2023 was challenging, even for us. But thanks to the price pressure, the mar-
ket share of discounters grew, so that worked in our favor. As a company, we did well in 2023, 
especially in Denmark and Norway. 

Q: What was your biggest achievement in 2023?

A: That’s easy. It was the acquisition of the majority of ALDI’s store network in Denmark. There 
had been similar milestones in the past, such as the takeover of Lidl stores in Norway in 2008, 
but the fact that the Albrecht brothers had been our idols from the start made this deal very 
special. So when I sat down with ALDI to sign the agreement in a hotel in Copenhagen, I had 
to pinch myself to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. I’m probably the only person on the planet who 
has signed such acquisition agreements with both Lidl and ALDI. 

Q: How do you expect the grocery market to evolve in the Nordics over the coming years?

A: Because of the challenging macroeconomic situation, shoppers will keep looking for ways 
to save money. I think there is still room for growth for discounters, especially because they offer 
such high quality in the Nordics. In the big cities, supermarkets will have a hard time competing 
with soft discounters, at least for regular shopping trips for 90 percent of the population.

Q: What is your aspiration for 2024?

A: We want to be the market leader in discount grocery, and we are well positioned because 
we are the most efficient player thanks to simplicity, franchise, and standardization. We have 
only one grocery brand, REMA 1000, with one concept and one assortment. That creates a slim 
and efficient value chain all the way from sourcing to distribution. And thanks to the franchise 
system, we also have a slim administration.

Q: And what is the biggest challenge you are facing in 2024?

A: The biggest challenge is the integration of the stores we have acquired. In a normal year, we 
recruit 15 to 25 new franchisees. Now, we have to onboard 70 franchisees and 2,200 employ-
ees in nine months. With all these new people coming in, it won’t be easy to uphold our strong 
culture. But the ALDI deal has given the entire organization an adrenaline rush, so I’m confident 
we can pull it off.

Q: What is your perspective on sustainability?

A: Our credo is to offer the highest quality at the lowest price, delivered in a responsible way. 
We have a commitment to cut our carbon emissions in half by 2030, and that is a demanding 
task. We work with 10,000 suppliers from 200 countries, so the complexity is considerable. But 
what makes me optimistic is that I expect brand owners to address Scope 1 and 2 emissions. If 
everyone follows the same logic, it’s going to work. 

Q: Do you think retailers will have to change the way they run their business to promote 
sustainability?

A: No doubt. Until now, you had the operations and an ESG [environmental, social, and gov-
ernance] department. In the future, you have to put the ESG department in the heart and the 
mind of every employee. At Reitan, we are glad that we started working on sustainability years 
ago. Thanks to that head start, we have answers to some of the increasingly difficult questions 
consumers are asking today.

32

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeQ: What are your thoughts on meat and dairy?

A: Everyone is talking about reducing red meat and dairy. But you have to replace it with 
something. So you have to get creative with new production methods, new tastes, new rec-
ipes, new category management solutions, and new formats to entice shoppers to try plant-
based alternatives. Food producers and food distributors have to take joint responsibility to 
make change happen. Right now, we are ahead of the policy makers, but if we fail to deliver, 
they might create an environment that’s even stricter than that of today.

“The shift of sales 
to online channels 
is inevitable, so I 
encourage everyone  
to embrace it.”

Niklas Östberg 
CEO, Delivery Hero

Delivery Hero is a food and grocery delivery company 
that is active in more than 70 countries. 

Q: Delivery Hero is a pioneer in the meal delivery space. What factors, capabilities, and 
strategic decisions have contributed to its success? What were the turning points, if any? 

A: One of the key strengths of Delivery Hero was always our willingness to take risks and inno-
vate. Many of our brands were part of the first wave of online marketplaces that digitalized the 
phone-based meal ordering process, enabled by an online menu. The next stage of evolution 
was to take end-to-end ownership of the delivery experience. This was a tough and capital-in-
tensive transition, but it was worth it. Our current model brings a better customer experience 
and stronger long-term economics, in line with our vision: “Always delivering an amazing expe-
rience—fast, easy and to your doorstep.”

We started out with meal delivery and added grocery delivery as a second pillar of our busi-
ness. In the future, we will expand our offering to additional categories, some of which we are 
already testing, such as health and beauty. While we acknowledge that each category has its 
own rules, we are confident we can bring the capabilities that helped us win in meal and gro-
cery delivery to bear in new categories, such as building a large customer base, using data to 
understand customer demands, and establishing efficient logistics networks for delivery.

Q: How important will grocery delivery be for your business in 2024?

A: We believe that the absolute growth in grocery delivery will be slightly higher in 2024 than 
it was in 2023, and it will be a growth engine for us as customer adoption of our service keeps 
growing. Because of this, we focus on improving the customer experience in this area with more 
choice, more affordability, and higher reliability of delivery. 

Q: How do you see the different segments of your market evolving? 

A: There is still substantial room for growth in meal delivery. We know this from comparing 
customer penetration in our most mature markets with penetration in markets we have entered 
only recently. This is why we will keep investing in meal delivery. 

In the grocery space, the future will be omnichannel, where customers shop online—much 
more than today—and visit physical stores for a different experience. We’re betting on quick 
commerce because we believe this will become the largest share of online grocery, and we see 
this in just how fast we’ve grown this business over the past four years and how much our cus-
tomers love it. What matters to them is choice, so our own stores, Dmarts, now have more than 
4,000 items on offer. Many of them are offering more than 6,000. And through our marketplace 

34

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: Europemodel, our traditional grocery-retail partners already provide an assortment on our apps that 
is almost identical to what customers find in stores. 

Q: You said that choice is very important for customers. What about prices?

A: We are acutely aware of the importance of affordability for both meal and grocery deliv-
ery, and I believe our offerings are priced very attractively, given the convenience we provide. 
We already offer subscription programs in which customers can benefit from attractive 
discounts on both items and delivery fees. Also, many restaurants and consumer brands 
are keen to appear on our platform to achieve visibility, and they are prepared to grant very 
attractive conditions that we can pass on to our customers in the form of discounts. 

Q: What will be the biggest challenges for meal delivery companies in the next three to 
five years? How will Delivery Hero prepare to tackle these?

A: In the current environment of economic and political uncertainty with high inflation, high 
interest rates, and geopolitical risks, the key challenge is to find ways to create an affordable 
customer offering. Meal delivery shouldn’t be a luxury. To ensure affordability, we work hard 
to build an efficient ecosystem through data and technology, and we reinvest the savings 
this efficiency generates into our customer offering.

Another challenge is the need to keep innovating. Ours is a young and dynamic industry, and 
we need to make sure we stay at the forefront of how it is changing and adapt our business 
model accordingly. One question we are focusing on is what delivery technologies will look 
like in five years. To prepare for any future changes, we conduct pilot tests and engage in 
partnerships with pioneers. 

Q: Reaching profitability is one of the keys to success in your industry, and many play-
ers struggle with it. In your view, what are the key levers needed to reach profitability in 
the delivery space for 2024 and beyond? 

A: It may sound paradoxical, but the single biggest driver of profitability in our industry is 
still growth. Our fixed costs don’t really increase, so any sales growth improves the bottom 
line. As far as variable costs are concerned, customer acquisition and the actual delivery are 
the biggest line items in the profit and loss statement. We know from the data in our most 
mature markets that there is still a lot of potential to improve efficiency in both areas. As the 
business grows, the share of sales allocated to marketing can be reduced. And as increasing 
volume enables us to weave denser delivery networks, delivery cost goes down. 

Q: What role do partnerships, such as with consumer packaged goods manufacturers 
[CPGs] and retailers, play for Delivery Hero? 

A: These partnerships are essential. For CPGs, we can be 
an important growth channel because of the convenience 
we offer to customers. We are also an attractive advertising 
partner for manufacturers, given the trove of data we have 
on customer interest and demand. And the income we derive 
from retail media advertising helps us improve profitability 
and maintain an affordable customer proposition. 

“Our aspiration is to be 
the driving force behind 
all changes that bring 
better service, even if 
that comes at some 
short-term expense.”

We are also committed to good partnerships with retailers. In 
fact, we already generate more sales through retail partners 
on our platforms than we do through our own stores, and we 
also see more growth there going forward. For these partner-
ships, we focus primarily on using data to help retailers grow and succeed on the platform. In 
addition, we offer technology solutions for seamless order fulfillment. 

Retail partnerships also enhance the offerings in Dmarts—for example, by including the 
private label brands of our retail partners in our assortment. And some stores operate fully 
under a partner’s brand using our fulfillment capabilities. 

35

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeQ: What advice would you give to CEOs in traditional retail? 

A: The shift of sales to online channels is inevitable, so I encourage everyone to embrace it. We 
want to help traditional retailers unlock those online channels with our marketplace model and 
tech capabilities, and I look forward to expanding our relationships with traditional retailers in 
the years to come. 

Q: What is your most important learning from your journey with Delivery Hero?

A: You can never stand still. Delivery Hero is a young company, and we have already shaped 
and mastered several transformations. So the value of keeping an open mind, upholding an 
entrepreneurial spirit, and being able to change course quickly cannot be overstated. Our aspi-
ration is to be the driving force behind all changes that bring better service, even if that comes 
at some short-term expense. 

Q: What legacy do you want to leave behind with Delivery Hero?

A: Two things are very important for me. One, that we build a truly successful business, and 
that can be done only if we attract and retain amazing people. I want to leave behind a compa-
ny that offers an attractive environment for the best people in the world. 

Two, I believe doing business makes sense only if we also look beyond the things that can be 
measured in euros and cents. I want us to be mindful of the environment and the communities 
we operate in, mitigating any potential adverse impacts and making a positive contribution. This 
is why we started investing in sustainability years ago, and I hope that Delivery Hero will be rec-
ognized as a company that truly cares.

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeInterview

“This year will be 
challenging. We expect 
the increase in costs to 
outgrow the increase in 
revenues.”

Lionel Souque 
CEO, Rewe Group

Rewe is a retail group that employs nearly 390,000  
people, with more than 10,000 outlets in 21 countries.

Q: What was 2023 like for Rewe? What are the things that stand out?

A: It was quite a good year, especially from a sales perspective, although that was partly driven 
by inflation, not necessarily by volume growth. Penny, our discount business, did especially well 
in 2023—even better than our supermarkets. This is partly due to the continuing price sensitivi-
ty of consumers.

A major milestone in 2023 was that we put an end to printed leaflets. We were the first food 
retailer in Europe to do that. We used to print more than a billion leaflets every year in Germa-
ny alone, and we stopped doing that as of July 1, 2023. Now all our leaflets are digital, and this 
hasn’t damaged our sales. We’re saving more than 70,000 tons of paper as well as CO2 emis-
sions. Of course, we’re also saving money that we’re reinvesting in other marketing channels, 
such as radio and TV.

Q: Would you encourage other players to do the same?

A: Many found our decision risky. After all, the leaflet has been by far the most important ad-
vertising medium in the retail industry for decades. However, we can only improve in terms of 
sustainability if we rethink, question the old, and show courage. I am proud that we have been a 
first mover in order to improve our ecological footprint. At Rewe, we have a tradition of leading the 
way toward more sustainable practices. In 2016, for example, we were the first major food retailer 
in Germany to abandon plastic bags.

Q: Looking ahead to 2024, how do you think it will be different from 2023?

A: This year will be challenging. We expect that the increase in costs will outgrow the increase 
in revenues in 2024, especially regarding personnel costs and rents, because wage agreements 
and indexed rents reflect inflation with a time delay. At the same time, food inflation is already 
declining throughout Europe, especially in Eastern Europe. In fact, some countries there have 
entered a period of deflation. As a result, prices are going down while some sourcing costs 
remain high. That will be the big challenge for 2024. On the bright side, we expect fewer supply 
chain disruptions than in the past few years, so our shelves should be well stocked.

37

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeQ: What is your expectation for online grocery in 2024 and beyond? Will you keep invest-
ing in e-grocery?

A: I still expect that e-grocery will keep growing—but much slower than a lot of people expect-
ed. In addition, the low average price per item in Germany makes it hard to turn a profit with 
e-grocery. However, we do not only focus on our online delivery. That’s why we also focus part 
of our investments on click and collect. We believe that this might be a very economically viable 
model in the long run. Home delivery is complex and costly; many customers prefer picking up 
their orders in their own time to waiting at home for the delivery to arrive. In France, pickup is 
already the biggest segment of the online grocery market. Additionally, we are selling wine and 
spirits online through two dedicated shops, Weinfreunde and Kölner Weinkeller, because we 
think these categories are particularly well suited for e-commerce.

Q: What other growth opportunities do you pursue beyond your core business?

A: One of our fastest-growing brands is ZooRoyal, a pet product retailer. That’s a booming 
market. Unlike Rewe, ZooRoyal started online, but we are opening brick-and-mortar stores 
as well. We have also replaced private label pet food in Rewe stores with ZooRoyal products. 
Beyond that, we are offering some of our e-commerce, fulfillment, and payment solutions to 
other companies, and we are investing in food tech. But these are small ventures at this point in 
terms of sales and profits.

Q: What about retail media?

A: That’s a massive market. Some experts say it will be worth €25 billion in 2026, twice what it 
was in 2023. Most manufacturers spend the lion’s share of their retail media budget on e-com-
merce platforms, but we have a different proposition, driven by digital technology at the point of 
sale. We already have more than 3,000 screens in our Rewe and Penny stores that can display 
ads. That’s about as close as you can get to the purchase decision, and manufacturers like that. 
We have a dedicated team that has been developing this kind of technology for several years, 
and I am convinced that it will keep growing.

Q: Sustainability is a concern for a growing share of consumers. How does Rewe respond 
to that?

A: It’s not only one of our strategic priorities; it’s also in our DNA. Rewe started as a buying 
cooperative almost 100 years ago, so the social aspect of sustainability was there right from 
the start. More recently, we have added the environmental aspect. In 2008, we switched all our 
stores in Germany to green energy. A few years ago, well before the energy crisis, we invested 
in an offshore wind energy plant that will launch in 2025. The green energy we will receive from 
the wind energy plant reflects nearly 20 percent of Rewe Group’s total energy consumption. 
Last year, our German divisions Rewe and Penny joined the Science Based Targets initiative, 
and the rest of the group will follow in 2024. Our ambitious goal is to achieve net-zero emis-
sions as a group by 2050. The focus here is not only on drastically reducing emissions in our 
own activities but also in our supply chains.

Sustainability matters to our customers, and it matters to current and future employees as 
well. In job interviews, that’s one of the first questions many applicants ask: What are you 
doing for the environment? And investors ask the same question. That’s why we put out a 
sustainability-linked bond last year. In Germany, we work with the Nature and Biodiversity 
Conservation Union, a nongovernmental organization for nature conservancy, to restore moors, 
which can absorb high amounts of CO2. We will have solar panels on up to 1,000 roofs of stores 
and warehouses to generate power on-site, and we have already built hundreds of stores that 
conform to green building standards, with a much lower energy footprint than traditional stores. 
In 2024, we will open the 400th store of this type.

38

Signs of Hope—The State of Grocery Retail 2024: EuropeQ: What about agriculture? How do you think your relations with farmers will evolve in the 
coming years, especially in terms of sustainable practices?

A: We can and want to play an active role in that, which is why we always seek direct dialogue 
and joint solutions when working together. But in most cases, we don’t have direct relations 
with those farmers. We as food retailers are only a small part of the overall system. Manufactur-
ers are much more powerful in that respect because they directly negotiate with the producers 
or farmers.

There are only a few cases where we directly work together with farmers. These are often 
only small-scale arrangements, in which a farm is supplying a handful of nearby stores. These 
arrangements are typically very beneficial for farmers because there’s a specific customer seg-
ment prepared to pay higher prices for local produce, meat, and dairy.

To promote sustainable agriculture at scale and reduce Scope 3 emissions of greenhouse gas-
es, we have established a competence center for agriculture that pools the expertise of farmers, 
scientists, policymakers, and retailers. The ultimate aim is to reduce the climate impact of the 
entire supply chain, from farm to table.

Q: To wrap things up, let’s talk about talent. Are you having trouble filling vacancies?

A: Last year, Rewe Group received more than 700,000 applications for 65,000 jobs in Germany 
alone, including temporary and part-time positions. That’s more than ten applicants per job. 
What comes after that is decisive. Attracting, developing, and retaining great people is there-
fore a strategic priority for us. In retail, great people are crucial. Of course, there are shortages 
in certain areas, such as IT and data analytics, where many employers are competing for the 
same pool of people. The good news is that we have a lot of exciting opportunities for these 
people because of the high potential for automation and data leverage in retail.

Once we hire someone, we do everything we can to retain them. We have very little fluctuation 
in central and managerial functions. In stores, it’s a bit higher. To improve retention, we talk to 
those who leave. We can see that topics such as the relationship to the direct manager play an 
important role when deciding to leave the company. This is something we take very seriously. 
We have set up an awareness program for managers at all levels, with coaching and dedicated 
training modules. Retail can be a very top-down industry, but we want Rewe to be different. We 
want it to be a place of respect, appreciation, and empowerment.
