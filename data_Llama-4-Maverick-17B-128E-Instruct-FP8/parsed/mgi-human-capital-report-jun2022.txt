Preface

Human capital underpins economies and organizations, but it belongs first and foremost to 
the individual. It represents the collective knowledge, attributes, skills, experience, and health 
of the workforce—and also the potential residing within each person. The realization of that 
potential is a complex equation that has engaged economists, social scientists, and other 
academics for decades.

Today, the combination of pandemic-related disruptions, labor shortages, and ongoing 
technological change in the workplace has given this timeless topic new immediacy. Many 
business leaders are refocusing on how to evaluate and attract talent, how to retain valued 
employees, and how to develop the skills that will be needed to compete in the future. These 
questions come at a time when millions of workers are reassessing what they want to get out 
of work every day and whether they are on a fulfilling career path for the long term.

While a great deal of research on human capital focuses on the crucial periods of early 
childhood development and education, we consider what happens after people enter the 
workforce—specifically, how work experience and the acquisition of skills pay off for the 
individual. Our research takes a decidedly micro lens to this issue. We use longitudinal data to 
trace actual career trajectories, looking at the specific bundles of skills required in each role 
someone held over time and how moving into new roles affects their earnings.

Our findings underscore the role of organizations in realizing and augmenting the value of 
human capital—and continuously boosting the pool of skills across entire economies. This 
raises large questions for business leaders. Since work experience builds human capital 
(as measured by lifetime earnings), can organizations develop their employees in a way that 
equips them to outperform the norm? How can they create conditions that widen career 
options and help to make upward mobility a reality for many more people?

In brief

Human capital at work: The value of experience

Human capital—the knowledge, 
attributes, skills, experience, and 
health of the workforce—evolves 
from childhood through education 
and work. By our estimates, its value 
represents roughly two-thirds of an 
individual’s total wealth. Our research 
traces how people accumulate human 
capital throughout their working lives, 
focusing on the role of experience. We 
analyze four million de-identified online 
professional profiles in the United 
States, Germany, the United Kingdom, 
and India, examining career trajectories 
and skill requirements across roles. 
We find that taking on new roles with 
expanded skills is central to upward 
mobility, particularly for those who 
lack formal credentials. Employers are 
critical engines of mobility, creating the 
opportunities for bold moves that can 
lift workers and themselves.

Work experience accounts for 
about half of the average person’s 
accumulated human capital. 
The value of human capital can be 
approximated as lifetime earnings. We 
attribute a proportion of this value to 
experience based on role moves and 
skill distances observed over a person’s 
work history and their expected 
future wage growth. We find that skills 
acquired or demonstrated through 
work experience contribute an average 
of 46 percent of lifetime earnings on 
average. We note, however, that our 
dataset does not capture enablers and 
life experiences prior to and during an 
individual’s career; these factors also 
influence the accumulation of skills in 
important ways.

The “experience effect” generally 
matters more for workers with 
less education. Work experience 
contributes 40 to 43 percent of average 
lifetime earnings in the United States, 
Germany, and the United Kingdom but 
58 percent in India, where fewer people 
have higher education. In general, 

people without college degrees who 
start in low-wage jobs are more reliant 
on work experience. It contributes 
65 to 75 percent of lifetime earnings 
for those who begin as tile setters or 
counter workers in the United States, 
for example, compared with 35 percent 
for physicians or lawyers.

Role moves enable individuals 
to accumulate skills and work 
experience. Workers in our sample 
switched roles every two to four years 
on average, depending on the country. 
With each role change after a first job, 
we isolate the share of distinct skills 
required in the new role to determine 
the “skill distance” of the move. The 
median skill distance per role move is 
25 percent or more. Four out of five 
people started in one occupation and 
ended in another. Significantly, more 
than 80 percent of role moves involved 
joining new organizations.

Role moves can pay off, and bolder 
moves can deliver bigger boosts. 
In our sample, roughly a third of US, 
German, and UK workers, and almost 
a quarter of Indian workers, are on a 
path to move up one or more quintiles 
in estimated lifetime earnings from 
their career starting points. Skills 
derived through experience account for 
60 to 80 percent of lifetime earnings 
for those who move up but only 35 to 
55 percent for those who stay flat 
or drop down. Those who move up 
changed roles more frequently and 
made bolder moves. Upwardly mobile 
cohorts in the United States and 
India made moves with an average 
skill distance of 30 to 40 percent; 
those who stayed flat averaged only 
20 to 30 percent. Bold moves involve 
employers hiring people with less 
proven skills and workers pursuing 
opportunities that represent a stretch.

“Experience seekers” and “early 
movers” successfully harness 
this dynamic. Within our sample, 

individuals follow distinct career 
patterns. Experience seekers start 
with lower-than-average wages but 
make more moves and stretch their 
capabilities substantially each time; 
the cumulative effect gives them 
stronger wage growth than any other 
cohort. Early movers make big moves 
only early in their careers. For both 
groups in the advanced economies we 
studied, experience accounts for 60 to 
70 percent of lifetime earnings. That 
share is only about 30 percent for lock-
ins, who make only incremental moves.

Individuals get a lift from early 
experience in effective organizations. 
Controlling for differences in 
occupation, time spent early in a career 
with an effective organization explains 
half of the variation in experience-
linked earnings. These employers not 
only have better overall organizational 
health, but also devote more time 
to training and offer more internal 
advancement—and their employees are 
more likely to be upwardly mobile.

Employers can attract and retain 
the best talent by focusing on three 
priorities. First, evaluate current 
employees and candidates not only 
for their knowledge and skills but 
also for their potential and capacity 
to learn. Second, embrace mobility by 
considering candidates with different 
backgrounds and histories, and by 
creating both upward and lateral 
career paths within the organization 
so that employees can gain more 
varied experience. When talented 
people leave, celebrate their success 
and stay open to welcoming them 
back. Third, strengthen coaching and 
on-the-job training, particularly early 
in an employee’s tenure and whenever 
someone changes roles. Companies 
that establish themselves as great 
learning organizations are magnets 
for talent.

Executive summary

The most important resource in any economy or organization is its human capital—that is, the 
collective knowledge, attributes, skills, experience, and health of the workforce. While human 
capital development starts in early childhood and continues through formal education, our 
research focuses on the next stage, which spans the full working life.

Human capital is much more than a macroeconomic abstraction. Each person has a unique, 
living, breathing set of capabilities. They belong to the individual, who decides where to put 
them to work. The degree of choice is not limitless, of course. People are the products of 
geography, family, and education; their starting points matter. Having career options also 
depends on an individual’s abilities and attributes, their networks, their family obligations, 
the health of the broader labor market, and societal factors. While we recognize these 
constraints, career moves are nevertheless an important mechanism for expanding skills and 
increasing earnings.

At a moment when many workers are exercising greater self-determination in the job market, 
exploring mobility is particularly timely. To do this, we analyze a data set of de-identified job 
histories for approximately four million workers across the United States, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and India.

The patterns within our data set show that moving into a new role pays off—and even more 
so when someone lands a new position that stretches their capabilities or better utilizes their 
skills. For people who start out in low-paying positions, movement is critical to boosting their 
lifetime earnings. Without extraordinary capabilities and luck, the entry-level retail cashier 
is unlikely to ever catch up to what the entry-level law associate can expect to earn over a 
lifetime. But if she is able to make strategic role moves, it is possible for her to climb into a 
higher earnings bracket than where she started.

In our data sample, roughly a third of US, German, and UK workers, and almost a quarter of 
Indian workers, are on a path to move up one or more quintiles in estimated lifetime earnings 
from their career starting points. This upwardly mobile group stands out for making more 
frequent and bolder role moves.

However, individuals cannot make bold moves unless an employer sees their potential 
and takes a chance on them in hiring. The most effective way for an individual to maximize 
the “experience effect” is to join an organization that prioritizes and strengthens 
their development.

Work experience adds to the value of human capital

Formal education is an important driver of an individual’s lifetime earnings, which can be 
used as a proxy to measure the value of human capital.1 Yet learning continues throughout 
a working life. Organizations set up their working environments with systems and practices 
that help employees become more productive. When people enter these settings, value is 
created. In addition to earning wages, workers gain knowledge and new capabilities that they 
carry with them for the remainder of their careers. Many roles require employees to become 

1  Jacob Mincer found that an additional year of education adds more to an individual’s lifetime earnings than experience. 

Returns to schooling follow a linear curve, showing a consistent increase in earnings with each year of additional 
education, while returns to experience follow a quadratic curve. See “Investment in human capital and personal income 
distribution,” Journal of Political Economy, volume 66, number 4, 1958. The changing wealth of nations 2018: Building a 
sustainable future, World Bank, 2018, similarly uses lifetime earnings to measure human capital.

Human capital at work: The value of experienceproficient with new types of software or equipment. Employees benefit from structured 
learning programs and daily coaching on the job. There are insights to be gained from 
watching colleagues handle tricky situations gracefully (or not) and seeing how managers 
motivate their teams (or do not).

Someone who starts out taking orders in a fast-food restaurant learns the art of handling 
difficult customers and staying cool under pressure. Someone who starts in IT by answering 
questions on a help desk absorbs technical knowledge that they continue to use when 
they become a network administrator. An inventory clerk who watches his manager solve 
logistical logjams can apply those approaches in a future role as a warehouse manager or 
procurement agent.

Our research focuses on how work experience builds on the foundation of formal education 
and adds to the value of human capital, expressed as lifetime earnings (see Box E1, “Modeling 
the link between role moves and the addition of skills to lifetime earnings”). We define work 
experience holistically as the accumulated knowledge that individuals gain by being in the 
labor market. This can occur through doing the work itself, formal employer-provided learning 
and development programs, and job changes that better match someone’s existing skills or 
enable them to add new skills.

Box E1
Modeling the link between role moves and the addition of skills to lifetime earnings

We track the new skills associated with 
role changes and make assumptions 
about how the salaries for each role 
link to new versus entry-level skills. 
We do this over the course of each 
individual’s work history to estimate the 
share of their lifetime earnings that can 
be attributed to skills gained through 
work experience.1

We use a detailed data set covering 
all of the job moves made by about a 
million workers in each of four focus 
countries: the United States, Germany, 
the United Kingdom, and India. We look 
at each individual’s career trajectory, 
starting with the first job listed after 
the latest educational degree obtained 
and including all role moves made 
over the observed work history. For 
each role change, we quantify the 
“skill distance,” or the share of new or 
nonoverlapping skills associated with 
the new job. This reflects someone’s 
opportunity to acquire or deploy 
additional skills in the new role.2 The 
illustrative example in Exhibit E1 shows 
a German worker who started as a 
welder. He changed jobs twice, moving 

a skill distance of 33 percent when 
becoming a maintenance supervisor 
and then 47 percent when becoming 
a production manager. His average 
skill distance is therefore 40 percent, 
which is representative of the typical 
German worker.

We measure outcomes by looking at 
lifetime earnings, estimated as the sum 
total of nominal salaries received over 
a 30-year working life. This combines 
salaries associated with roles during an 
individual’s observed work history plus 
projections for the remaining years of 
that person’s working life.

We attribute the entirety of the 
entry-level salary to entry-level skills. 
Then, throughout the observed work 
history, we attribute a share of each 
new role’s salary to work experience 
in proportion to the share of new 
or nonoverlapping skills that role 
introduces, relative to entry-level skills. 
We make this assumption because 
work experience is one of the main 
mechanisms through which individuals 
are able to acquire and deploy new 

skills after formal education. Although 
we acknowledge that education and 
personal attributes have an enduring 
impact, including teaching someone 
how to learn, we make a simplifying 
assumption in the attribution of salary 
to capture the scope and direction of 
the experience effect. For the length 
of time someone stays in a given role, 
we attribute standard yearly salary 
increases to work experience. We 
make this assumption to capture the 
effect of deepening existing skills. 
Similarly, to calculate projected 
earnings beyond the work history, we 
apply historical rates of wage growth 
to the final observed role, attributing all 
future projected wage growth to work 
experience. We assume no additional 
role moves.

Finally, we pool results for all workers 
in each of our four focus countries, 
reweighting the sample to reflect 
workforce composition, and consider 
the implications for the average 
lifetime earnings of a typical worker in 
the workforce.3

1  Salaries are defined as the average yearly compensation provided for physical and knowledge work, not including benefits such as health insurance, subsidies, and 

tax transfers.

2  We identify skills for each role from job postings, weighted by skill frequency, which gives more weight to skills that are specialized to a particular role rather than 

common across roles. When someone makes a role move, we measure skill distance as the share of nonoverlapping skills between the two roles.

McKinsey Global Institute~2/3

of the total wealth 
of individuals is their 
human capital

Work experience contributes 40 to 60 percent of a worker’s 
human capital

By our estimates, the value of human capital represents roughly two-thirds of an 
individual’s total wealth.2 Our results show that skills acquired or deployed through 
work experience contribute an average of 46 percent of the value of human capital 
over a typical working life. However, this is an average for the four focus countries, 
and it contains a wide range of variations (Exhibit E2).

The experience effect looks strikingly similar across the advanced economies we 
studied. Our analysis finds that work experience contributes 40 percent of the 
average individual’s lifetime earnings in the United States, and 43 percent in both 
Germany and the United Kingdom.

2  The value of human capital is measured as the present value of all future earnings for the average individual 
in our sample. To measure its contribution to total wealth, we draw on MGI’s 2021 report The rise and rise of 
the global balance sheet, which estimates average net worth per capita. Other estimates by the World Bank 
conclude that human capital wealth accounts for roughly two-thirds of global wealth (as much as 70 percent 
in high-income OECD countries). See The changing wealth of nations 2018: Building a sustainable future, 
World Bank, 2018.

1We attribute the ability to acquire the first job, and therefore the first job’s salary, entirely to entry-level skills. Wage increases while in the same job are attribut-
ed to work experience, as is a proportion of new salary after a role move, based on the share of new skills required in the new role. Lifetime proportions calcu-
lated are based on the area under the curve. ²Lifetime earnings are the sum of nominal salaries over an individual’s 30-year working life. Combines estimates 
based on salaries of roles held during the observed work history plus projections for the remaining years of a working life, applying historical rates of wage 
growth to the final observed role and assuming no further role moves.

Wage increases while in the same job are attributed to work experience, as is a proportion of new salary after a role move, based on the share of new skills required in the new role.

Access to education remains a key challenge in India—and with only 12 percent of the 
population having tertiary education as of 2020, work experience will be a more important 
driver of income for the workforce as a whole by default.4 In other emerging economies that 
have similarly low levels of educational attainment plus high productivity and wage growth 
from a low baseline, lifetime earnings are likely to exhibit similar patterns.

Work experience is a bigger determinant for people who start in 
occupations without significant credentialing barriers

People who start out in occupations with higher educational and credentialing barriers (such 
as lawyers and dentists) earn more than other workers over their lifetimes. For most of them, 
entry-level skills contribute a larger share of those earnings (Exhibit E3).

The reverse is generally true for people who start out in occupations with lower educational 
requirements. They typically earn less over a lifetime, with the greater share driven by work 
experience. The income growth of a dishwasher who becomes a food prep cook, then a line 
cook, and eventually a sous chef is almost entirely fueled by techniques and tricks of the trade 
learned on the job. In addition to enabling someone to acquire skills, work experience gives 
that person a track record, which is valuable in and of itself for the signal it sends to potential 
future employers.

In the United States, for example, the size of the experience effect varies substantially 
across starting occupations. At the low end are chiropractors. Before treating patients, they 
must complete a doctor of chiropractic degree program that can take three to five years, 
then pass a series of licensing exams. Their entry-level skills account for 85 percent of their 
lifetime earnings. At the other end of the spectrum are food batchmakers, who operate 
equipment that blends ingredients for manufacture. People who start in this type of factory 
job are less likely to have higher education; the experience they amass over time determines 
90 percent of their lifetime earnings. Exhibit E4 shows how this pattern plays out in a number 
of other occupations.

While greater educational attainment generally correlates to higher 
lifetime earnings, some people defy the odds

Someone who attended poor-quality schools and lacks any postsecondary education or 
training is starting from behind in the labor market. Many employers rely on college degrees 
as a well-established signal of a candidate’s employability.5

Yet educational disadvantage does not have to lock in destiny—at least not for everyone. In 
the United States, for example, our lifetime earnings projections show a subset of people 
who overcome the odds. Of particular note, 28 percent of high school graduates have higher 
earnings potential than the median holders of associate degrees, and 37 percent of associate 
degree holders could earn more than median bachelor’s degree holders over their lifetimes.

In all the countries we studied, a sizable cohort is on a path to move up one or more earning 
quintiles from their career starting point. As Exhibit E5 (found later in the Executive Summary) 
illustrates, this applies to 30 percent of workers in the United States.6 In fact, 6.1 percent of US 
workers are on track to move from the bottom lifetime earnings quintile all the way to the top. 
Similar shares are upwardly mobile in the other advanced economies we studied (32 percent 
in Germany and 34 percent in the United Kingdom). In India, 23 percent of workers are on a 
path to move into higher earnings brackets.

3 

In India, faster nominal wage growth results in a greater lift to lifetime earnings than in the advanced economies we 
studied. Our analysis focuses on the proportion of lifetime earnings attributable to entry-level skills versus experience, 
rather than the absolute growth in wages, making the estimates comparable across countries.

Human capital at work: The value of experienceThe upwardly mobile group appears to be amassing work experience in an effective way 
that yields real benefits. In our worker sample, experience accounts for 60 to 80 percent of 
lifetime earnings for the cohort that moved up but only 35 to 55 percent for those who stayed 
flat or dropped down. However, many people are unable to make these leaps because of 
structural and social barriers, such as biases, the lasting effects of unequal education, and 
the lack of professional networks.

most cases, people are moving to new organizations

Movement is an inherent feature of labor markets. Across the entire data set, the average 
person switched roles every two to four years, with a median skill distance of 25 to 45 percent, 
depending on the country.7 This matters because role moves enable individuals to build or 
demonstrate their skills.

Moves can involve workers assuming new roles within their current company, moving to a 
different employer, changing specialties or occupations, or pursuing a combination of these 
strategies. At any given time, a significant proportion of role moves are triggered by firings 
and layoffs in addition to voluntary job changes.

In our data set, each move increased wages by 6 to 10 percent on average. However, this 
includes people who moved into lower-paying roles, whether by choice or out of necessity.

Forty to 50 percent of the role moves over the decade we observed involved pay increases. 
The workers who made these moves managed to boost their earnings by 30 to 45 percent on 
average each time.

More than 80 percent of the role moves observed in our data set involved someone leaving 
one employer for another. Far fewer moves involved people being promoted into more senior 
roles or branching into different specializations within their existing organizations.8 This 
high level of external movement holds true across all cohorts. This seems to indicate that 
many employers do not have internal advancement tracks that are wide enough to keep 
most people growing and working toward higher rewards over time. Individuals who want to 
reinvent themselves and take on more senior roles often have to go to a new environment to 
do so.

The bolder the move, the bigger the boost

Those who take new roles involving bigger changes or challenges receive bigger rewards. 
We look at both wages and skill requirements associated with consecutive roles held by 
each individual. Salary-increasing moves involved a median skill distance of 35 to 50 percent 
across countries, higher than the range of 25 to 45 percent for all moves across countries.

In other words, when someone made a move for higher pay, their new job typically involved 
significant skills and responsibilities that were not part of their previous job. This kind of 
movement is enabled when an employer is willing to take a chance on someone’s potential, 
even if they have not been performing exactly the same tasks in their previous role. The new 
role may be a major learning opportunity, or it may be a better match that enables someone 
to deploy existing skills that they have not been utilizing.9 Incremental moves with largely 
overlapping requirements do not pack the same punch.

The most upwardly mobile cohorts in the sample make both frequent moves and bold moves 
(Exhibit E5).10 In the United States, for example, people who moved into higher earning 
quintiles averaged 4.6 moves during the observed period, while those who stayed flat 
averaged 3.7 moves. The upwardly mobile in the United States and India made moves with 
an average skill distance of 30 to 40 percent; those who stayed flat averaged only 20 to 
30 percent. This growth in skills compounds with each move, resulting in a far bigger shift in 
capabilities and responsibilities over the entirety of a working life.

7  This is in line with the most recent (prepandemic) US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, which show that US wage and 
salary workers had a median tenure with their current employer of 4.1 years in January 2020. See www.bls.gov/opub/
ted/2020/median-tenure-with-current-employer-was-4-point-1-years-in-january-2020.htm.
It is possible that self-reported data may not reflect the full number of internal moves. For example, an individual who 
receives their fifth promotion at a longtime employer may not bother to update their online professional profile but will do 
so when moving to a new employer.

Review of Economic Studies, volume 61, number 3, 1994.

10  We describe moves involving high skill distances as “bold.” This term describes only the distinctiveness of the skill 

requirements in the new role; it is not a comment on the nature of the role itself or of the risk-taking involved in making the 
move. An incremental move is one in which skill distance is in the bottom quartile of the sample; a bolder move is one in the 
top quartile.

McKinsey Global Institute‘Experience seekers’ and ‘early movers’ boost their earnings through 
effective career moves

From our data set, we looked at a smaller universe of people with more than ten years of work 
history. Within it, four distinct archetypes emerge. They are not meant to convey individuals’ 
circumstances or motivation; they describe movement patterns and outcomes, with 
illustrative examples.

 — Experience seekers start with lower-than-average wages but propel themselves 

upward by moving roles more frequently than their peers and stretching their capabilities 
substantially each time. The cumulative effect gives them stronger wage growth than 
any other archetype. Consider someone who starts as an administrative assistant at 
one nonprofit before landing a job cultivating donors in the development department of 
another. From there, she joins a research hospital as a grant writer before stepping into 
a broader communications role. Eventually she becomes head of media relations for a 
major university. Our experience seeker has managed to cross over into new industries 
and functions.

 — Early movers make bigger leaps in the first part of their career. Someone may start in one 
field, quickly realize that their passion lies elsewhere, and then get a break that enables 

In each country we studied, experience and role moves enable a significant share of workers to 
move into higher earning quintiles.

A graphic designer who makes print ads, for example, might become a 
user-experience designer early in her career.

 — Late movers stay put or make more incremental moves in the early stage of their career 
but eventually take a bolder step. Think of a seasoned journalist who goes into corporate 
communications, or a real estate agent who becomes a mortgage loan officer in a bank. 
This is by far the largest group in the sample.

 — Lock-ins change jobs less frequently, and when they do move, they do not make dramatic 

changes. This is not necessarily because someone is timid or stuck; they could also 
follow this strategy because they pursued what suited them from the start. Teachers, 
for example, have invested in specialized education and may have found their calling. 
However, lock-ins have the slowest wage growth, whether they start near the bottom or 
near the top. Doctors start at a very high salary but do not tend to make many role moves. 
While work experience accounts for 60 to 70 percent of lifetime earnings for experience 
seekers and early movers, that share is only about 30 percent for lock-ins.

Employers can attract and retain talent by recognizing potential, 
embracing mobility, and strengthening learning

Not all companies are equally good at developing people. Size is not the differentiator, as we 
find that small companies can be just as adept as their larger counterparts in this area. But 
companies with the strongest organizational health, those that offer more structured training 
for their employees, and those that provide more opportunities for internal advancement 
seem to stand out. People join these companies to build knowledge and networks, 
understanding that their experience will provide a valuable signal to other employers for the 
remainder of their careers. Early career experience at these companies helps employees go 
on to become more upwardly mobile (Exhibit E6).

Companies can help individuals build their experience capital and establish themselves 
as great learning organizations and magnets for talent in the process by focusing on 
three priorities:

 — Understand the potential in people as well as their current knowledge and skills. 

Most employers can benefit from challenging the status quo of how they select people 
for open roles. Instead of searching for “holy grail” external candidates whose prior 
experience precisely matches the responsibilities in an open role, leading organizations 
create systems for evaluating candidates based on their capacity to learn, their intrinsic 
capabilities, and their transferable skills. This requires designing assessments that 
are fit for purpose, focusing on the few core skills that matter for success in the role. 
It also involves removing biases that pigeonhole people into the roles they are already 
performing; this point is particularly important when it comes to existing employees. In our 
sample, more than half of all role moves undertaken by individuals involved a skill distance 
of more than 25 percent—and this implies that people often have latent capabilities 
that are not recognized by their current employers. If someone’s track record shows the 
acquisition of new skills over time, it probably means that person is capable of learning 
more. Employers should be less constrained about recruiting candidates from traditional 
sources and backgrounds, and more open to people who have taken unconventional 
career paths.

 — Embrace mobility. Within our data set, more than 80 percent of all the role moves 

individuals made involved changing employers. Since there is no fighting the fact that 
talented people will move, the key for employers is becoming part of this flow. Employers 
can aim to beat the odds on both sides of this 80-20 dynamic. On one end, they can 
attract the best candidates among the big talent pool that is always searching. On the 
other, they can boost the productivity and engagement of valued employees who stay. 
To ensure that proven employees don’t have to go elsewhere to advance, organizations 
should set the expectation that part of a manager’s job is developing people who will 
go on to other things. Each role should have clear paths toward future roles, with skill 

10

McKinsey Global Instituterequirements delineated at each stage. One way to do this in a large organization is to 
create an internal digital platform where employees can access learning modules and find 
their next opportunity. Mobility is experience, not just upward progression—and lateral 
movement is a neglected opportunity for many organizations. Designing rotational and 
transfer options for a broader pool of employees can keep proven midcareer workers 
learning and feeling energized. When talented employees do move on, celebrate them as 
success stories—and don’t close the door on welcoming them back in a different capacity 
in the future.

 — Strengthen coaching, and emphasize the new or first manager’s role. A great deal 

of skills development happens day to day on the job, in a process that accumulates over 
time and eventually accounts for almost half of all human capital over a working life, as our 
research suggests. Coaching and apprenticeship can maximize this effect. Our research

Exhibit E6Most of the differences in individuals’ experience capital are associated with early exposure to an effective organization, followed by bold role moves.United States, Germany, United Kingdom, and India1Measured by regressing experience capital for an individual on metrics measuring organizational practices of the firm where the individual starts his career, boldness of role moves, and frequency of role moves. Controlled for starting wage, latest wage in work history, years of post-education observed work experience, average experience capital for a given sector, occupation, and organization. N = 65,554 individuals and R-squared = 0.54.2Based on average training hours per full-time employee, internal moves as a share of all moves, and the overall score from McKinsey’s Organizational Health Index. Firms with the highest OHI scores may attract intrinsically motivated individuals, who may be disproportionately likely to seek out new skills through workexperience, amplifying this metric. Metrics matched to the organization where an individual worked during the start of their career. N = 362 firms.3Role moves are changes in an individual’s job, occupation, occupation category, or organization. They include promotions or lateral moves within the same organization as well as moves from one employer to another.4We describe moves involving high skill distances as "bold." Skill distance is the share of nonoverlapping skill requirements between two roles, which shows the proportion of new skills required when someone moves into a new role. We identify skill requirements for each role from job posting data, weighted by skill frequency, which gives more weight to skills that are specialized to a particular role rather than common across roles. 5Role moves made within the company as a share of internal moves + separations; US data only.6Based on McKinsey’s proprietary Organizational Health Index (overall score).7Movement into higher earning quintiles is based on estimated lifetime earnings of the individual (compared to quintiles of starting wages), which is calculated as the sum total of the nominal salaries an individual receives over a 30-year working life.

year in any new job. Formal onboarding is not just an orientation session but a six-month 
to one-year period that should involve a thoughtfully created journey. Organizations 
can provide the tools for a running start, including a manager committed to delivering 
coaching and facilitating connections. Even after hitting their stride, employees need 
ongoing opportunities to learn; this can pay off in the form of higher morale and reduced 
attrition.11 In a June 2021 Gallup survey, 65 percent of US workers said that learning new 
skills is an extremely or very important factor in deciding whether to take a new job, and 
61 percent said it was extremely or very important in deciding whether to stay at their 
current job.12 Formal learning and development programs that prepare employees for 
future roles are part of this, but it is difficult to make them effective. Companies that are 
true learning organizations build their own formulas, customized to their needs.

Workers should choose their moves (and their employers) carefully

Since work experience creates value for the individual, how can someone maximize that 
effect? Controlling for differences in occupation, time spent early in a career with an effective 
organization (as defined by overall organizational health and greater emphasis on training 
and internal mobility) is associated with 50 percent of the variation in how experience adds to 
earnings. The remainder of the difference is associated with the boldness and frequency of 
moves that a person makes.

The pandemic appears to have prompted many workers to reevaluate their jobs, and many 
have been voting with their feet. According to US Bureau of Labor Statistics data, some 
47 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021. Millions have landed better jobs, and some 
became entrepreneurs.13 An increase in job switching has spread to other countries as well. 
Employers from Europe to China report labor shortages and hiring difficulties.14 Workers are in 
demand and taking advantage of new dynamism in the labor market.

While higher pay is obviously a motivation, particularly for people who have been struggling to 
make ends meet, many people are also looking for better working environments and flexibility. 
However, broader considerations determine whether a move will pay off in the longer term. 
Our research shows that bold role moves have the potential to propel workers forward.

There are often constraints on the ability to make moves, of course. Not everyone has access 
to an effective organization. People may hit the limits of their capabilities or health, while 
others need to prioritize family responsibilities. During periods of high unemployment, the 
options are fewer and farther between. Yet individuals who have the luxury of choosing each 
job move strategically can benefit in a lasting way by looking for learning opportunities and 
growth potential. As playwright Tom Stoppard put it: “Look on every exit as being an entrance 
somewhere else.”

A tale of two architects

Equally talented architects Jeanne and Jane earned degrees from the same 
prestigious university and passed the same professional certification exams. After 
that point, their paths diverged, largely because of the quality of their respective 
workplace experiences. 

Jeanne took a job with a boutique firm run by a renowned architect. However, its IT 
systems were outdated, and the founder delegated only low-value tasks and rarely 
took the time to offer feedback. 

Jane took a junior role at a commercial firm where a principal became her mentor. 
She learned how to use cutting-edge BIM modeling tools and how to develop 
project proposals. 

When both were ready to 
make career moves five years 
later, Jane had more options 
and secured a position 
with a substantially higher

1. Human capital 
development 
in context

This chapter lays out a framework for thinking about how human capital develops in various 
stages of life—and, importantly, how context influences each person’s journey. It reviews 
some of the seminal research that has defined the field and notes the difficulty of measuring 
something as endlessly varied and complex as human potential.

Our empirical findings can be found in chapters 2 and 3. While much of the existing literature 
has examined returns to education, this report focuses on the individual and what comes 
after formal education. Specifically, it looks at how work experience enhances the value 
of human capital, taking a micro lens to the topic by drawing on millions of individual work 
histories. Chapter 4 delves into the implications of our findings for employers, workers, and 
policy makers.

What is human capital, and why is it called ‘capital’ in the first place?

The word capital has long been used to refer to finance or to physical assets such as factories, 
machinery, and real estate. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, economists began expanding 
its usage to people, focusing on the skills, experience, and talents of individuals as a source 
of economic value. Around this time, Jacob Mincer, Theodore Schultz, and Gary Becker 
published seminal works framing education and training as investments in “human capital.”15

From the beginning, some critics objected to the phrase, arguing that it reduces the many 
complex dimensions of a person to an input of production that a company can “acquire.”16 
Becker acknowledged this point of view in his 1992 Nobel Prize lecture:

The very concept of human capital was alleged to be demeaning because it treated people 
as machines. To approach schooling as an investment rather than a cultural experience 
was considered unfeeling and extremely narrow. As a result, I hesitated a long time before 
deciding to call my book Human Capital, and hedged the risk by using a long subtitle. Only 
gradually did economists, let alone others, accept the concept of human capital as a valuable 
tool in the analysis of various economic and social issues.

Human capital is simply the qualities and abilities that make people productive. In formal 
terms, it is defined as the knowledge, skills, competencies, and attributes individuals 
accumulate throughout their lives.17 It also reflects their health, which determines their ability 
to work and the length of time over which they are able to do so.

Human capital resides within each individual, but the term also has meaning at a company 
or economy-wide level. Economists and social scientists often look at the educational 

15  See Jacob Mincer, “Investment in human capital and personal income distribution,” Journal of Political Economy, 
volume LXVI, number 4, August 1958; and Gary Becker, Human capital: A theoretical and empirical analysis, with 
special reference to education, Harvard University Press, 1964. For useful overviews of human capital theory including 
comprehensive literature reviews, see Claudia Goldin, “Human capital,” in The Handbook of Cliometrics, Claude Diebolt 
and Michael Haupert, eds., Springer Verlag, 2016; or Luca Flabbi and Roberta Gatti, A primer on human capital, World 
Bank Group, January 2018.

16  Theodore Schultz noted this objection in his seminal article “Investment in human capital,” American Economic Review, 
1961. For more recent criticisms, see, for example, Jeff Spross, “Why Big Business needs to stop calling people ‘human 
capital,’” The Week, May 15, 2015; and Jordan Weissmann, “The actual problem with saying ‘human capital stock,’” Slate,

Human capital at work: The value of experienceattainment of the population as a proxy for the sum total of skills in a given economy, while 
companies may consider the talent pool they employ as making up their human capital. Yet 
even when employed by a company, individuals can choose to do something different. Human 
capital is therefore unlike other forms of capital that a company owns and deploys at its 
own discretion.

Human capital develops over much of an individual’s lifetime and is 
heavily influenced by contextual settings

Human capital develops in a dynamic process that begins in childhood and continues 
throughout education and an individual’s working life (Exhibit 1). Individuals start off with 
a set of personal characteristics, some of which are innate and some of which are instilled. 
Natural abilities may emerge early in life—perhaps an instinctive grasp of math, verbal acuity, 
persuasiveness, or artistic flair.

Youth is a significant period for the development of human capital, and formal education is a 
major determinant of where people start in the labor market. Education is about much more 
than preparing people to become workers, of course. It enables students to expand their 
intellectual horizons, appreciate literature and the arts, become better citizens, and evaluate 
information more critically. At the same time, formal education does help students develop 
competencies that will enable them to make a living and contribute to society.18

Early influences have lifelong effects on human capital. Childhood advantages and 
disadvantages influence the later stages of human capital development, affecting the choices 
people make in their education and careers. For example, access to adequate nutrition during 
childhood can improve academic performance, with positive knock-on effects on earnings, 
while access to extracurricular activities during adolescence can open doors later.19 Moving 
children from disadvantaged to advantaged neighborhoods has been shown to improve their 
future earnings.20 Children born into marginalized groups have more systemic barriers to 
overcome throughout life.

Context can either cultivate or hold back human potential. Families and communities may 
nurture or neglect a child’s development. An individual’s family upbringing and community 
context may foster positive traits (such as work ethic, honesty, punctuality, leadership, 
resilience, and empathy) or negative traits (such as a lack of self-confidence or a sense of 
entitlement). Parents who read to their children and insist that chores must be done are often 
planting the seeds of lifelong habits, as are those who set low expectations or fail to nurture 
children in their formative years. The family and social contexts also matter when it comes 
to the educational opportunities available to an individual as well as how that person will 
approach their studies. Some families and broader communities put enormous emphasis on 
academic achievement; others do not. In societies where gender equity lags, for example, girls 
may be brought up with lower expectations about what they can hope to achieve and may find 
more limited opportunities.

Similarly, the context provided by institutions matters. Schools and institutions of higher 
learning may expand or fail to ignite someone’s potential. Early childhood education programs 
that establish a strong foundation for cognitive, linguistic, social, and emotional skills can 
yield tremendous returns over a lifetime.21 Public investments in health and education are also 
highly influential. Throughout a lifetime, health and well-being are necessary preconditions 
for people to thrive. In adulthood, people need energy and resilience to work productively; ill 
health and early mortality cause not only personal suffering but also loss of income. At the

and countries that are poor. Health and income tend to improve in tandem.22 The likelihood 
of being able to enjoy a longer and more fruitful working life creates a greater incentive for 
individuals to invest in developing their skills.23

At every stage, life experiences and individual decisions can alter human capital development. 
Studies have found that events such as teenage pregnancy and losing parents before 
adulthood can adversely affect educational attainment and economic outcomes.24 At any time 
of life, someone may become ill or injured. Some life events and decisions can have cascading 
effects that influence the opportunities someone can pursue.

Experience gained in the work environment activates and augments 
human capital

While early childhood development and formal education set the foundation, people do 
not emerge from their teens or early 20s as fully formed beings who will remain static for 
the remainder of their lives. Human capital continues to evolve. Picking up the baton from 
educational institutions, employers become the major incubators of skills development 
for adults.

People accumulate experience and skills with each role they perform throughout a working 
life. Kenneth Arrow propounds that learning is the product of experience; individuals learn 
by doing.25 In our research, we define experience holistically as the accumulated knowledge 
workers gain by being in the labor market, whether through doing the work itself, formal 
employer-provided learning and development programs, and job changes that better match 
existing skills or offer opportunities to learn entirely new skills. In addition to acquiring new 
skills over time, individuals also build work histories that can signal capabilities and value to 
potential future employers.

Someone who starts out taking orders in a fast-food restaurant learns the art of handling 
difficult customers and staying cool under pressure; these abilities can serve them well 
in many other roles in the future. People who start in IT answering questions on a help 
desk absorb technical knowledge that they continue to use when they become network 
administrators. An inventory clerk who watches his manager solve logistical logjams can apply 
those approaches in a future role as a warehouse manager or procurement agent. Even a stint 
in a dysfunctional workplace can impart lessons about how things should not be done.

Employers set up their working environments with practices and systems that are meant to 
help employees become more productive. The practices that define “the way an organization 
works” are known as organizational capital.26 While these practices belong to the company 
and stay with it, workers gain valuable knowledge and experience from interacting with 
them—and they carry these new capabilities wherever they go for the remainder of their 
career. The value of their human capital increases, and they are frequently able to command 
higher wages in the next role.

The combination of human capital with physical, organizational, and other intangible capital 
pays off immediately for companies (in the form of growth, profits, and innovation) and 
for workers (in the form of wages and life satisfaction linked to work). The way that these 
economic rewards are shared among workers, employers, and shareholders varies from 
company to company and from labor market to labor market.

determine the ease with which someone can find rewarding work. In addition, the parameters 
of a given labor market—including competition policy, labor regulations, the effectiveness 
of labor market matching, and investments in training—determine the ease of moving 
between jobs.27

Work experience is an important signal of human capital’s value

Human capital realizes its value through the dynamic process of hiring people to fill jobs. 
But hiring is a notoriously imprecise exercise in which employers and candidates alike are 
operating with limited information about what the other party has to offer. Individuals may not 
know if they will be the right fit for a job or whether they will enjoy it. For their part, prospective 
employers cannot easily ascertain a candidate’s level of skill and productivity and frequently 
rely on signals like educational qualifications.

Economist Michael Spence documented how prospective employers view a college degree 
as a signal of a job seeker’s intelligence and potential. This mental shortcut generally leads 
them to assume that more highly educated individuals will be more productive employees.28

administrative data, OECD, 2020; Daron Acemoglu, Francisco A. Gallego, and James A. Robinson, “Institutions, human

How a reporter built a reputation 
and made it to the majors

The career arc of a US sports reporter shows how the 
“experience effect” grows over time. After graduating from 
college, he lands a job at a small-town newspaper covering 
minor league and high school baseball. He gets that first 
break solely on the strength of writing skills developed in 
school, both in formal English and journalism classes and at his 
college newspaper. 

In the years that follow, the reporter moves on to publications 
in successively bigger cities, covering major league teams. The 
editors who hire him at these papers glance at his resume to 
see where he went to school but ultimately bring him on board 
because his recent stories have been so good. A lot of this is 
thanks to newsroom mentors who helped him become a better 
interviewer and storyteller. 

Much later in life, having seen the business and drama of sports 
up close, he writes a well-received book, becomes a columnist 
for a national magazine, and starts doing TV commentary. 
While he continues to rely on the fundamental writing skills he 
developed in school, the experiences he sought out become an 
increasingly important driver of his lifetime income, particularly 
in the culminating years of his career.

19

Human capital at work: The value of experienceWork experience can serve a similar signaling purpose as people seek out new roles over the 
course of their careers.29

A young person who recently graduated from Cambridge might have excellent prospects for 
landing a high-paying entry-level job. But if, 25 years later, that same person has a spotty 
work history that does not show evidence of keeping his skills current, that Cambridge degree 
would be much less likely to sway a prospective employer. By the same token, someone 
without a college degree may have a hard time landing a good first job. But if, 25 years later, 
her work history shows a steady progression of jobs with new skills, the experience effect can 
provide a signal of her capabilities. Although there is an information gap, hiring managers can 
now see the skills she has acquired—and that fact signals that she is likely capable of adding 
even more.

In offering an alternative signal to education, work experience can enable better matches 
between job seekers and job vacancies (see Box 1, “The role of job matching in discovering 
human capital’s value”).

However, some unknowns remain until someone is performing in a new role. Because of this 
information gap in hiring, a process of “signaling discovery” unfolds as the employer and 
employee observe each other in the workplace. The employee adds new skills, and, at the 
same time, the information gaps about that person’s capabilities and characteristics are filled 
in. Signaling discovery picks up both of these effects, and it is difficult to separate their value 
in enhancing human capital.

Measuring human capital remains a challenge

Human capital reflects the human experience in all its glorious messiness—and by its nature, 
it is hard to measure. Further complicating the challenge is the fact that human capital 
investment typically pays off over the very long term. The accumulation of knowledge, 
experience, and skills is a dynamic process that is perpetually able to increase.

Attempts to measure human capital have followed two main approaches. The first focuses on 
indicators. Some studies have focused on single indicators (such as educational attainment, 
educational quality, or health status), while others involve indexes that combine multiple 
indicators, such as the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development 
Index, the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, and the World Economic Forum’s Global 
Human Capital Index.

The second measurement approach attempts to measure the value of human capital in 
monetary terms, whether in the cost of investment or in the outcomes and returns attributed 
to it.30

One way to measure the value of human capital at the macro level is through the “residual.” 
Robert Solow constructed a model to illustrate how various inputs affect economic growth 
and account for cross-country differences.31 Yet a residual portion could not be attributed to 
easily quantifiable factors such as the savings rate or population growth. Other economists 
subsequently added human capital to Solow’s growth model, positing that it is a critical driving 
force that augments physical capital.32

Another way to estimate the monetary returns to human capital is by measuring the present 
value of the labor force’s future earnings. This was done for the first time using household

The role of job matching in discovering human capital’s value

Workers make role moves that require new skills in order to learn, advance, and build 
their experience capital (the share of lifetime earnings associated with skills learned 
through experience). Or perhaps they are searching for roles that better match their work 
preferences, or they want an opportunity to use latent capabilities that are not being 
recognized by their current employer.

Job matching theory captures how outcomes in the labor market are the result of a two-
sided dynamic of employers looking for workers and job seekers looking for work; it 
considers how well vacancies are matched to the labor force.1 The job-worker match is 
conditional upon both parties agreeing that the capabilities of the worker are a good fit for 
the organization and that the features of the job, including the wage offer, are a good match 
to the worker’s expectations and preferences. Consider a customer service representative 
at a real estate company who gradually picks up skills and industry-specific knowledge. 
When she subsequently searches for and is hired into a real estate broker role, the move 
improves the match between her existing abilities and the skills required by the position.

A worker who is poorly matched desires a new role but does not have information about 
alternative roles. Turnover occurs either when new information is acquired about the 
individual’s current job (the imperfection of the match becomes clear, and moving on 
becomes the best course of action) or about a possible alternative job.2 In other words, 
turnover is the product of push or pull factors.

This matching process takes time. The search process itself is costly and time-consuming. 
Both sides have incomplete information, and no two job seekers and jobs are exactly alike. 
This information gap and other labor market frictions often lead to imperfect matches.3 The 
possibility of better matching motivates both the employee and the employer to search 
for alternatives.

Economists refer to jobs as “experience goods” to convey that the only means of 
determining the quality of a given match is by making it and living it out.4 For example, a 
pharmaceutical chemist may want to try her hand as a university research scientist, but 
after spending a year in the role, she might conclude that she prefers the faster pace of 
corporate life after all. In this view, turnover declines with job tenure because the new 
information that would result in someone quitting or being fired is introduced early on. 
Similarly, turnover probability could be highest at the beginning of a career, when the 
likelihood of new information shocks may be highest. Turnover as a result of the arrival 
of new information about alternative job matches is captured by “pure search goods” or 
“inspection goods.”5 For example, an individual early in their career may be uncertain about 
what job they will really enjoy and engage in “job shopping” to figure it out.

In both instances, it becomes clear that employers and job seekers alike could benefit from 
better ways of evaluating matches.

Human capital at work: The value of experiencesurveys to estimate lifetime earnings by the World Bank. Another study has estimated human 
capital per capita using data on average education levels for countries as a whole.33

A common thread in the study of human capital is its association with education. Multiple 
studies have concluded that additional years of schooling and formal skills training are 
associated with increased income.34 Robert Barro, for example, examined 98 countries 
over a quarter century and found a strong positive correlation between their initial levels of 
human capital (taking school enrollment rates as a proxy) and their subsequent growth in per 
capita GDP.35

Although it is often omitted from discussions of how to spur economic growth, health is 
another important aspect of human capital.36 The field of health economics has developed 
alongside the study of human capital, and the two often intersect. Health economist Michael 
Grossman, a student of Becker and Mincer, proposed a view of health as a “durable capital 
stock that produces an output of healthy time.”37 Health metrics are highly correlated with per 
capita income levels across countries—although good health and higher national incomes 
tend to create a virtuous cycle, making the effect difficult to isolate with precision. Studies 
have estimated that health improvements increased the pace of economic growth by about 
one-third in industrialized countries over the past century.38 Improvements in life expectancy 
increase the size of the labor force, while better nutrition and healthcare have given more 
people the ability to be productive.

While human capital may be measured and understood through education, health, and the 
associated investment and returns in these areas, a holistic view also needs to incorporate 
skill formation and the associated returns for individuals over their working lives. Much of this 
process occurs within the firm, where workers interact with physical and intangible assets and 
are exposed to systems, processes, and learning and development opportunities.

While acknowledging the influences of organizational, economic, and societal contexts, 
this research focuses on observed individual behavior. We trace the journeys of millions of 
workers to understand how work experience adds to their human capital over time.

2. How the ‘experience 

effect’ builds 
human capital

Formal education is an important driver of lifetime earnings.39 But learning continues 
throughout a working life. Every job someone holds adds a layer of experience and, possibly, 
new skills. Most involve day-to-day coaching and performance feedback; some may offer 
formal learning and development programs. Many roles require employees to become 
proficient with new types of software or equipment, which expands their technical skills. 
There are insights to be gained from watching colleagues handle tricky situations gracefully 
(or not) and seeing how managers motivate their teams (or do not).

This chapter considers what happens after an individual leaves education to enter the 
workforce and how skills gained through work experience augment the value of human 
capital. We estimate the share of lifetime earnings that can be attributed to work experience 
by tracking the new skills associated with role changes and making assumptions about how 
the salaries for each role link to new versus entry-level skills.

We find that accumulated work experience accounts for roughly half of the average person’s 
lifetime earnings. The remainder is associated with the skills that the person took into their 
entry-level position.40 However, the size of the “experience effect” varies substantially across 
geographies, occupations, and sectors.

We also find that people with lower educational attainment are more reliant on work 
experience to grow their earnings over time. This is consistent with Becker’s seminal research, 
which suggests that for more educated workers, a greater proportion of their lifetime earnings 
can be attributed to education.41

For those who start without the advantage of credentials that signal value to potential 
employers, adding learning and skills through work experience is the primary strategy 
for getting ahead in the labor market. This is not always easy. Factors ranging from family 
caregiving obligations to biases in hiring can constrain someone’s options. In a rapidly 
growing economy, individuals have a multitude of opportunities; in a low-growth environment, 
there is fierce competition for open positions. But while people do not have control over 
factors such as where they were born, their family upbringing, or their health, they do exercise 
some degree of choice in the occupations they pursue and the organizations they join—and 
those choices are especially important for people who start in low-wage jobs.

39  Jacob Mincer found that an additional year of education adds more to an individual’s lifetime earnings than experience. 

Returns to schooling follow a linear curve, showing a consistent increase in earnings with each year of additional 
education, while returns to experience follow a quadratic curve. See “Investment in human capital and personal income 
distribution,” Journal of Political Economy, volume 66, number 4, 1958. See also Jacob Mincer, Schooling, experience, 
and earnings, NBER, 1974. Other studies corroborate this view in advanced economies such as the United States and 
in developing countries such as Colombia. See Rakesh Mohan, “The determinants of labour earnings in developing 
metropolis: Estimates from Bogotá and Cali, Colombia,” World Bank staff working paper number 498, October 1981. The 
changing wealth of nations 2018: Building a sustainable future, World Bank, 2018, similarly uses lifetime earnings to 
measure human capital.

40  Our findings align with research from Becker suggesting that post-education workforce experience has the same kind of 
effects on observed earnings as formal education and similar human capital investments, and from Schultz suggesting 
that only 36 to 70 percent of the previously unexplained increase in earnings for US workers in recent decades is 
explained by returns to the education of workers. Gary Becker, Human capital: A theoretical and empirical analysis, with 
special reference to education, second edition, Harvard University Press, 1971; and Theodore Schultz, “Investment in 
human capital,” American Economic Review, volume 51, number 1, 1961.

Human capital at work: The value of experience~2/3

of the total wealth 
of individuals is their 
human capital

The value of human capital can be approximated by lifetime earnings

Human capital is potential. It exists whether or not it is utilized. Yet labor markets set a price 
for human capital through compensation. When individuals earn wages, their human capital 
goes from being latent potential to realized economic value. That value is sizable: by our 
estimates, human capital makes up roughly two-thirds of total wealth per capita in the 
countries we studied (see Box 2, “Capitalizing the value of human capital”).

The value of each individual’s human capital can be expressed by looking at lifetime 
earnings.42 These vary widely for people who start in different roles, even within the same 
occupational category (Exhibit 2).

Box 2
Capitalizing the value of human capital

Human capital is an important component of wealth for nations and individuals. Yet 
it is not generally recognized as capital on the balance sheets of nations. Earlier MGI 
research on the global balance sheet noted that current accounting standards define 
an asset on a balance sheet as an item that stores value, is owned by an institution, 
generates economic benefits for the owner, and can carry value from one accounting 
period into another.1 Human capital certainly represents a potential stream of 
economic benefits for the individual who utilizes their knowledge, skills, attributes, 
work experience, and health over time. But it cannot be owned and traded by an 
institution and is not normally accounted for as a capital asset. Another key difference 
is that human capital generates income streams only if applied via work; building and 
possessing it alone do not activate its economic value.

In this research, we create a rough approximation of the capitalized value of human 
capital by discounting the stream of nominal salaries a worker can be expected to 
receive over a 30-year working life. We find that in the United States, the value of an 
average worker’s human capital—that is, the present value of their lifetime earnings—
would be in the range of $890,000 to $1,060,000, assuming the worker’s salary in their 
final observed role continues to increase at its historical growth rate over the residual 
portion of their career. Scaling this per worker estimate across the whole population, 
the value of human capital would be in the range of $450,000 to $540,000 on a per 
capita basis (since a large share of the population does not work). This is almost twice 
the average per capita net worth in the United States, which our research on the global 
balance sheet estimates at about $272,000. Similar estimates for Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and India also suggest that human capital accounts for 60 to 70 percent of 
per capita wealth in those countries. An earlier study by the World Bank that estimates 
the value of human capital based on the present value of future earnings for the labor 
force also concludes that it is the largest asset across all income groups, constituting 
64 percent of total wealth in 2014.2

Non-marketized services such as childcare and food preparation are not assigned a 
value in measurement frameworks that rely on national accounts. Properly accounting 
for such household services would increase the value of human capital even more, 
particularly for women. Furthermore, human capital represents value whether or 
not it is deployed in the labor market. A sound education, good health, and positive 
personal attributes are critical aspects of life, and their value goes far beyond 
economic measures.

individual receives over a 30-year working life.43 This is a combination of salaries associated 
with roles held by a person during the observed work history covered in our data set plus 
estimates for the remaining years of that person’s working life (for more detail, see Box 3, 
“Our data sample: Scope and limitations,” and the technical appendix). We arrive at those 
future estimates by applying national average salary growth to the wages associated with 
the individual’s final observed occupation, and we assume the person makes no additional 
role moves.

While wages are a simple way to express the realized economic value of human capital, we 
acknowledge that this is a narrow measurement that does not capture all of the benefits 
of education and all of the ways in which individuals contribute to others and to society. In 
addition, maximizing income is not everyone’s primary goal. Some people who have the 
potential to land better-paying jobs choose not to for a variety of reasons. A creative person 
may work in community theater rather than at an ad agency because of a passion for the 
arts, while someone who is a caregiver at home may not want to put the bulk of their energy 
into a demanding role. Many freelancers and entrepreneurs pursue their ventures because 
they value the autonomy and flexibility they would not have in a corporate role.44 Despite 
these nuances, we make a simplifying assumption for the purposes of understanding labor 
market dynamics.

We trace role moves and the addition of skills, modeling their link to 
lifetime earnings

Two major sets of factors make someone employable: first, the attributes and capabilities they 
bring to their first job; and second, skills added or deployed through work experience.

Our approach focuses on how work experience builds on the foundation of formal education 
and adds to lifetime earnings. We track the new skills associated with role changes and make 
assumptions about how the salaries for each role link to new versus entry-level skills in order 
to estimate the share of lifetime earnings that can be attributed to work experience.

We draw on a detailed data set covering the work histories of more than a million workers 
each in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and India (see Box 3, later in this 
chapter, for details). We look at each individual’s career trajectory, starting with the first job 
listed after the latest educational degree obtained and including all role moves made over the 
observed work history. When someone makes a move, their new position typically has some 
skill requirements that do not overlap with their previous position; the nonoverlapping share is 
the “skill distance” between the two roles.45

The examples in Exhibit 3 illustrate this process. In the first, a German worker who started as 
a welder changed jobs twice, moving a skill distance of 33 percent to become a maintenance 
supervisor and then 47 percent to become a production manager. His average skill distance 
is therefore 40 percent, which is representative of the typical German worker. In the second 
example, a US worker who starts as an office clerk also changes roles twice, moving a skill 
distance of 42 percent when becoming a shift manager and then 54 percent in becoming 
a store manager. Viewing individual career journeys in the context of the skills deployed 
over time, and how they change, allows us to understand the dynamic of human capital 
accumulation and discovery in a detailed and real-world way.

43  Salaries are defined as the average yearly compensation provided for physical and knowledge work, not including benefits 

like health insurance, subsidies, and tax transfers.

44  Independent work: Choice, necessity, and the gig economy, McKinsey Global Institute, October 2016.
45  We identify skills for each role from job postings, weighted by skill frequency, which gives more weight to skills that are 
specialized to a particular role rather than common across roles. When someone makes a role move, we measure skill 
distance as the number of nonoverlapping skills between the two roles.

Our data sample: Scope and limitations

Our research uses proprietary information from McKinsey’s Organizational Data Platform, 
which draws on licensed, de-identified data from millions of online public professional 
profiles. We also use data from 350 million job posting records over 2018 and 2019 from more 
than 50,000 job boards to estimate a typical starting salary for each role. Postings from job 
boards are also used to determine the skills associated with each role, which comes into play 
in our analysis of the skill distance involved in each individual move (discussed in chapter 3). 
To estimate salary change over time for each role, we use data at the standard occupation 
category level from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics; Germany’s Federal Employment 
Agency, BA; the UK Office for National Statistics; and India’s National Sample Survey 
Office and Periodic Labour Force Survey. All data have been de-duplicated, cleaned, and 
harmonized (into 4,000 roles and 220 skills) using a proprietary algorithm to ensure accurate 
comparisons of roles, salaries, and skills.

For our analyses, we created a “worker data set” of roles, role moves, salaries, and skill 
distances between moves for a randomized subset of work histories through 2019 for 
approximately a million workers each in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and 
India (Exhibit 4). The focus countries were chosen to represent advanced economies with a 
variety of different labor markets plus a large and diverse developing economy. We further 
narrowed the data set to a subset of profiles containing information on an educational starting 
point for entry-level jobs (ranging from 230,000 to 410,000 individual profiles per country). 
This enabled us to look at the contribution of entry-level skills associated with educational 
attainment vis-à-vis skills gained through work experience to lifetime earnings.

The sample was reweighted to reflect each country’s occupational mix, drawing on data from 
national labor agencies.

Self-reporting. Since the online professional profiles are self-reported, they could reflect 
biases due to selective reporting of work and education histories. For example, an individual 
who receives their fifth promotion at their longtime employer may not bother to update their 
online professional profile but will be sure to do so when moving to a new employer. This could 
cause an under-representation of internal role moves.

Imperfect representation within the sample. Because the lowest-paid workers are unlikely 
to have online professional profiles, some occupations are not represented in the sample. 
While we estimate that only 1 percent of workers in the United Kingdom and 8 percent of 
workers in Germany are missing (in roles such as street cleaners, for example), 20 percent 
of workers are not represented in the United States (people in roles such as house cleaners 
and home health aides). In India, up to 45 percent of workers are missing (many of them farm 
laborers); this type of data issue would occur in most developing countries with large informal 
economies or lower use of online platforms. Because workers missing from the sample are 
predominantly in low-paid and highly experience-reliant occupations, we may underestimate 
the experience effect in India, as these workers are seeing the highest wage growth, most of 
which can be attributed to work experience. In addition to missing occupations, there could be 
a bias in the outcomes due to reweighting some of the underweighted low-paid occupations 
like taxi drivers or cement masons, in which only a small, digitally savvy subset of workers 
show up in the profile database. These individuals may make more role moves thanks to their 
familiarity with online professional networking platforms, online job boards, or email alerts for 
vacancies, and may accumulate skills via online courses. Reweighting based on the behavior 
of this subset may lead us to overestimate the experience effect. Finally, because the average 
in our sample is six to ten years of observed work experience, and individuals tend to move 
more frequently in the early stages of their careers, the number of role moves we observe may 
be higher than the workforce average.

Generalized salary assumptions. Our data set does not capture all of the variations in pay 
offered by different employers and how this might vary for employees with different levels 
of seniority and performance. Individual online profiles do not contain information on the 
actual salary someone earned for a given job. We therefore apply average salary information 
gleaned from online job postings and national statistics. While these average numbers are 
correct, they do not capture the full range of pay.

Inability to fully separate the experience effect when there is no role change. People 
attain deeper mastery of their core skills over time. A surgeon may become more proficient 
and expert after performing thousands of similar procedures, or a carpenter’s workmanship 
may become finer with experience. In our approach, we capture this to some extent by 
attributing average yearly raises for the occupation (based on historical rates of wage growth) 
to work experience for the period of time someone stays in a given role. However, the data set 
does not capture the extent to which someone’s role might change over time even without a 
move, and in taking the average, we do not capture whether they receive unusually high raises 
for outstanding performance.

Limited information on personal and demographic characteristics. Our data set is drawn 
from de-identified online professional profiles. At this stage, we have been unable to study 
patterns associated with gender, race, age, place, health, family and economic circumstances, 
social networks, personal traits and motivations, and the like. We capture data on country, 
occupation, sector, and organizational affiliations of workers as key contextual elements.

31

Human capital at work: The value of experienceWe use our observations about skills acquisition to estimate the share of lifetime earnings that 
can be attributed to work experience. We estimate lifetime earnings as described earlier in 
this chapter, combining salaries associated with each role during the observed work history 
with future projections to span a 30-year working life.

We attribute the entirety of the entry-level salary to entry-level skills. Then, throughout the 
observed work history, we attribute a share of each new role’s salary to work experience 
in proportion to the share of new or nonoverlapping skills that the role introduces, relative 
to entry-level skills. We make this assumption because work experience is the arena in 
which individuals are able to acquire and deploy new skills after they finish their education. 
While education and personal attributes have an enduring impact, we make a simplifying 
assumption to attribute this portion of salary to skills acquired through experience.46

For the length of time someone stays in a given role, we assume standard yearly salary 
increases based on historical rates of wage growth for the occupation in their country. This 
means that even a person who never makes a job move would have some experience effect 
on earnings over time. Similarly, to calculate projected earnings beyond the work history, we 
apply historical rates of wage growth to the final observed role, attributing all future projected 
wage growth to work experience. We do not try to project additional role moves beyond the 
observed period. We attribute salary increases within the same role to work experience based 
on the assumption that this reflects the deepening of existing skills.

Finally, we pool results for all workers in each of our four focus countries, reweighting the 
sample to reflect workforce composition, and consider the implications for the average 
lifetime earnings of a typical worker.

Skills gained through work experience contribute about half of 
lifetime earnings, varying by country

Our results show that work experience contributes an average of 46 percent of the value of 
human capital over a typical working life in the four focus countries. Variations are discussed 
in the following sections. The curves in Exhibit 5, below, show that the contribution of work 
experience starts at zero and continues to rise upward over the entire working life.

Separating out the value of experience is not meant to diminish the ways in which education 
enhances work abilities. Although a degree is not a guarantee of success, there is a strong 
and well-established correlation between higher education and higher earnings.47 Education 
is a major determinant of a worker’s starting point, and the starting point does matter. It 
should also be noted that education and innate abilities are foundational and can prime 
someone to absorb insights and skills from work experience; they can also put people onto 
initial pathways that set up their later career moves. While nuances and interdependencies 
make it difficult to tease out each driver’s effect with precision, our analysis aims to show the 
scope and direction of the experience effect.

The contribution of work experience to lifetime earnings looks strikingly similar across the 
United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. However, the effect is far higher in India.

Our analysis finds that work experience contributes 40 percent of the average individual’s 
lifetime earnings in the United States. The comparable share is 43 percent in Germany 
and the United Kingdom. Germany does have a notably lower share of the population with 
tertiary education than the United States or the United Kingdom (around 30 percent of all 
working-age adults, versus around 50 percent in both of the latter countries in 2020).48 But

that gap.49

By contrast, work experience contributes almost 60 percent of lifetime earnings on average 
in India. The higher reliance on experience reflects the fact that access to education remains 
a key challenge. Most workers in India start their careers in blue-collar jobs—and given that 
only 12 percent of working-age adults had tertiary education in 2020, work experience is a 
more important driver of income by default.50 Faster nominal wage growth in India (albeit from 
a lower base) results in a greater lift to lifetime earnings than in the advanced economies we 
studied. Yet our analysis focuses on the proportion of lifetime earnings attributable to entry-
level skills versus experience, rather than the absolute growth in wages, making the estimates 
comparable across countries. 51

In other emerging economies that also have high wage growth from a low baseline and low 
levels of educational attainment, individual earnings profiles are likely to exhibit similar 
patterns. Learning and training on the job are especially critical enablers of income growth 
and opportunity for places where education systems are still being strengthened and 
built out.

Work experience is a bigger determinant for people who start in 
occupations without significant credentialing barriers

Wages, and therefore lifetime earnings, vary enormously across occupations—and so does 
the relative importance of entry-level skills and work experience in those earnings.

People who start out in occupations with higher educational and credentialing barriers (such 
as lawyers and dentists) earn more over their lifetimes; in most cases, the entry-level skills 
they acquired through education contribute a larger share of those earnings (Exhibit 6). 
The reverse is generally true for people who start out in occupations with lower educational 
requirements. They typically earn less over a lifetime, but a greater share is associated with 
work experience. The journey of a dishwasher who becomes a food prep cook, then moves up 
to become a line cook and eventually a sous chef is almost entirely fueled by the techniques 
and tricks of the trade he learns on the job.

In the United States, for example, the size of the experience effect varies enormously across 
starting occupations (Exhibit 7). At the low end are chiropractors. Before treating patients, 
they must complete a doctor of chiropractic degree program that can take three to five years; 
then they must pass a series of exams to become licensed to practice locally. Their initial 
education is by far the biggest factor in their lifetime earnings; work experience accounts 
for only 15 percent of the total. They have high lifetime earnings and are likely to begin and 
end their careers as chiropractors. At the other end of the spectrum are food batchmakers, 
who operate equipment that blends ingredients in the food manufacturing process. People 
who start off in this type of factory job are less likely to have higher education. They have low 
lifetime earnings, 87 percent of which is associated with work experience. Their ability to 
operate and inspect equipment could enable them to move into a role manufacturing other 
types of consumer goods, where they may again pick up new technical skills. This could in turn 
facilitate moves into more specialized or supervisory roles.

51  We are conservative in assuming only an average increase in salary based on the terminal occupation, with no additional 

role move premium over the remainder of an individual’s working life. But if we were to assume that the individual 
continues to make role moves during the projected period with the same frequency and skill distance as in the observed 
period, the experience share of lifetime earnings would increase. It would become 44 percent instead of 40 percent in the 
United States. For further detail, see the technical appendix.

in lifetime earnings and reliance on work experience. In the United States, for example, 
physicians earn significantly more than waiters over their lifetimes and are less reliant on work 
experience; they move comparatively fewer times, and their average skill distance per move is 
only 25 percent (compared to 60 percent for the average waiter). Commercial pilots earn more 
over their lifetimes and also derive a significant share of their earnings from skills learned 
through work experience. They move 3.1 times on average, with an average skill distance of 
65 percent per move. By contrast, maintenance and repair workers earn less-than-average 
wages over their lifetimes. The value they add through work experience does not compensate 
for the low contribution from entry-level skills (Exhibit 8).

In general, across our sample set in the United States, we observe that starting occupations 
with higher lifetime earnings have a smaller share attributable to work experience.52 Similar 
patterns hold in the other countries we studied. In the United Kingdom, the experience effect 
is lowest for psychiatric technicians (21 percent) and highest for tool grinders and sharpeners 
(91 percent). In Germany, it is lowest for ship engineers (26 percent) and highest for grounds 
maintenance workers (95 percent). In India, the experience effect is lowest for nursing 
assistants (28 percent) and highest for construction equipment operators (97 percent).

52  These results are statistically significant in all three advanced economies we studied (sample R-squared of 0.48 in the 

United States, 0.33 in the United Kingdom, and 0.27 in Germany). However, the results are notably weaker in India (sample 
R-squared of 0.12).

experience in building human capital

The share of lifetime earnings associated with work experience also varies across sectors. 
However, the differences at the sector level are much smaller than those across occupations 
since sectors aggregate many occupations. Each sector employs people in a wide range 
of occupations with varying education requirements. Healthcare, for example, includes 
home healthcare aides, nursing assistants, and custodians who maintain the cleanliness of 
hospitals and clinics; it also includes neurosurgeons, oncologists, and cardiologists. A sector’s 
exact occupational mix determines the size of the experience effect within it.

In the United States, workers in internet and software services derive 27 percent of their 
lifetime income from work experience. The comparable share in hospitality is 46 percent. In 
the latter sector, the occupations that drive the higher reliance on work experience include 
billing and posting clerks, entertainment attendants, and food batchmakers, among others.

In the United Kingdom, the experience effect is lowest in the diversified financials (investment 
trusts) sector, at 24 percent. It is highest in the consumer durables and apparel (leisure 
products) sector, at 52 percent, with occupations like retail salesperson and operations 
managers driving the higher share. In Germany, workers in wireless telecommunication 
services derive 31 percent of their lifetime income from work experience. The comparable 
share in the airline sector is 54 percent, with occupations like computer network architects 
and moving supervisors driving the higher share.

In India, the multi-utilities sector has the smallest experience effect, at 41 percent—a share 
that matches the sector average in the advanced economies we studied. The effect is highest 
within India’s consumer durables and apparel (leisure products) sector, at 75 percent. The 
occupations that drive the higher reliance on work experience include sales representatives 
and new accounts clerks, among others.

3. Movement  

matters

Individuals can make choices that maximize the experience effect. Someone who stays in 
the same administrative or production job for years on end is likely to get only modest annual 
salary increases. But if that same person changes roles, she is likely to secure a larger bump 
in pay, particularly if her new position offers the chance to learn and take on new types of 
responsibilities. The nature of movement matters.

The patterns within our data set show that changing roles pays off—and even more so when 
people move into new roles that stretch their skills more substantially. For people who start 
out in low-paying positions, movement is critical to boosting their lifetime earnings. The 
fact remains that without extraordinary capabilities and luck, the entry-level retail cashier 
is unlikely to ever catch up to what the entry-level law associate can expect to earn over a 
lifetime. But if she makes strategic role moves, she does have a chance to exit the lowest-
earning quintile where she started and move into a higher earning bracket.

Individuals who manage to land opportunities involving distinctly different skills and 
responsibilities gain greater rewards over time. The groups within our data set that we call 
“experience seekers” and “early movers” follow this playbook; they get the biggest earnings 
benefit from the experience effect as a result. But, as we discuss in chapter 4, bold moves also 
require employers to take a more expansive view of the potential within people.

While greater educational attainment generally produces higher 
lifetime earnings, some people defy the odds

In a world of growing inequality, education is often viewed as a make-or-break factor 
determining an individual’s lifetime prospects. Indeed, multiple studies have found a strong 
correlation between additional years of schooling and increased income.53 Excellent primary 
and secondary instruction can instill many of the foundational skills people need to be 
productive workers. By pursuing postsecondary degrees or vocational training, people can 
cultivate more sophisticated or specialized knowledge and capabilities that will command a 
significant lifetime premium. From 1979 to 2012, the gap in earnings between US high school 
graduates and college graduates doubled in size.54

Someone who could not attend good-quality schools or who lacks any postsecondary 
education or training is starting from behind in the labor market. Many employers rely on 
college degrees as a well-established signal of a candidate’s employability.55 Our data show 
that, on average, less educated workers see roughly the same rate of wage growth as more 
educated workers. But since the more educated workers typically start their careers with 
higher salaries, they tend to earn more over their lifetime.

53  See, for example, Robert J. Barro, “Economic growth in a cross section of countries,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, 

volume 106, number 2, May 1991; Jacob Mincer, “Investment in human capital and personal income distribution,” Journal 
of Political Economy, volume LXVI, number 4, August 1958; Orley Ashenfelter and Alan B. Krueger, “Estimates of the 
economic return to schooling from a new sample of twins,” American Economic Review, volume 84, number 5, December 
1994; and Richard Blundell et al., “The returns to higher education in Britain: Evidence from a British cohort,” Economic 
Journal, volume 110, number 461, February 2000.

Human capital at work: The value of experienceYet educational disadvantage does not have to lock in lifetime earnings—at least not for 
everyone. In the United States, for example, our lifetime earnings projections show a subset 
of people at each level of educational attainment eventually earning more than the median of 
those with the next-highest degree (Exhibit 9). Of particular note, 28 percent of high school 
graduates have higher earning potential than the median holders of associate degrees, 
and 37 percent of associate degree holders could earn more than the median holders of 
bachelor’s degrees over their lifetimes. The ability of this group to overcome the odds is 
particularly striking at a time of increasing inequality, a decoupling of wages and productivity 
growth, and a fall in absolute mobility in the United States.56

In all of the countries we studied, a significant cohort has the potential to move up one or more 
earning quintiles from their career starting point. As Exhibit 11, later in this chapter, illustrates, 
this applies to roughly one-third of workers in advanced economies (30 percent in the United 
States, 32 percent in Germany, and 34 percent in the United Kingdom) and to 23 percent of

workers in India.57 In the United States, some 6.1 percent are on track to move from the bottom 
to the top quintile in earnings. Other research on generational mobility looked at almost 
ten million US children and found that 36.7 percent were able to move into a higher income 
quintile than their parents. It also found that 7.5 percent moved from the bottom to the top 
quintile of earnings (compared to our findings of 6.1 percent).58

This upwardly mobile group of workers appears to be amassing experience in an effective way 
that yields real benefits. Work experience accounts for 60 to 80 percent of lifetime earnings 
for the cohort that moves up but only 35 to 55 percent for those who stay flat or drop down. 
Although not everyone has the opportunity to make these leaps, some people do manage to 
raise their trajectory well above their starting point, as the rest of this chapter will explore.

Role moves can unlock higher earnings—and most job changes 
involve people moving to new organizations

Job switching, once viewed by employers as a red flag, has become an accepted norm. The 
average person in our data set changed roles every two to four years.59

Moves can involve workers assuming new roles within their current company, taking a position 
with a different employer, changing specialties or occupations, or pursuing a combination of 
these strategies. In addition, a large share of moves occur when people are forced to find new 
positions after firings or layoffs. Involuntary separations have historically outpaced voluntary 
quits during downturns, while the reverse is true during periods of growth. Today, in the 
United States, voluntary quits are far more numerous than layoffs and firings, reflecting tight 
labor markets.60

Our research focuses on the opportunities associated with movement. While it takes 
additional education, training, or licensing to enter some professions and skilled trades, many 
moves can be made on the strength of skills learned through work experience alone. Our 
analysis focuses only on moves made after the last level of education listed in the professional 
profiles in our sample.

In our data set, each role move increased the worker’s salary by 6 to 10 percent on average.61 
However, this average is lowered by a number of people who moved into lower-paying roles. 
People accept steps down in pay for a variety of reasons. Many may have been laid off or fired. 
Others may need to leave a bad job quickly but keep paying the bills. Some may move for a 
partner’s opportunity, wish to downshift, or want to start over in an entirely new occupation.

The potential benefits of movement come into clearer focus when we set aside people who 
moved for lower pay. Forty to 50 percent of the role moves made in the decade we observed 
involved wage increases. The group who made salary-increasing moves managed to boost 
their earnings by 30 to 45 percent on average with each job change (Exhibit 10).

Everyone has heard about those rare individuals who start in a company’s mailroom and 
become its CEO years later. Yet more than 80 percent of the role moves observed in our data 
set involved someone moving from one organization to another.62 Far fewer people were 

57  These findings rely on salaries associated with observed work history for the period covered in our data set and on 

projections for the remaining years of a 30-year working life, applying historical rates of wage growth to the final observed 
role and assuming no more moves after that point. Jäntti et al. confirm a higher level of mobility in the United Kingdom than 
in the United States. See Markus Jäntti et al., American exceptionalism in a new light: A comparison of intergenerational 
earnings mobility in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom and the United States, Institute for the Study of Labor 
(IZA), discussion paper number 1938, 2006. See also Sandra E. Black and Paul J. Devereux, “Recent developments in 
intergenerational mobility,” in Orley Ashenfelter and David Card, eds., Handbook of labor economics, Elsevier, 2010.

58  See Raj Chetty et al., “Where is the land of opportunity? The geography of intergenerational mobility in the United States,” 

The Quarterly Journal of Economics, volume 129, number 4, 2014.

59  This is line with data from the most recent (prepandemic) US BLS data on employee tenure, which shows that the median 

number of years a US wage and salary worker had been with their current employer was 4.1 in January 2020.

of voluntary versus involuntary separations in the United States.

61  As noted in chapter 2, our analysis is based on generalized average salary assumptions by role and country; it does not 
capture all of the variations in pay offered by different employers and for employees with different levels of seniority or 
performance. The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker similarly shows that job switchers have faster wage growth than 
people who stay in their jobs. See atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.aspx.

Human capital at work: The value of experiencepromoted into more senior roles or branched into different specializations within their existing 
organizations. This 80-20 dynamic holds true for individuals across levels of earning potential.

This seems to indicate that many employers do not have internal advancement tracks that 
are wide enough to keep most people growing and working toward higher rewards over time. 
A manager who sees someone capably performing administrative or frontline tasks may 
pigeonhole that person. Individuals who want to reinvent themselves and take on more senior 
roles often have to go to a new environment to do so. (For more discussion on the implications 
of movement for both workers and companies, see chapter 4.)

The bolder the move, the bigger the boost

Our data suggest that the role movers in our sample who were able to make bigger changes 
received bigger rewards.63

We describe moves involving high skill distances as “bold.”64 This refers only to the 
distinctiveness of the skill requirements in the new role; it is not a comment on the nature of 
the occupation or the risk-taking involved in making the move.

More than half of all role moves in our sample involved a skill distance greater than 25 percent 
(Exhibit 11). In the United States, about 10 percent of role moves involved leaps in skill 
distances of more than 80 percent. Twenty percent of moves involved skill distances of more 
than 50 percent, while another 20 percent involved skill distances of more than 30 percent. 
Additionally, about 30 percent of moves were more incremental, with skill distances less than 
10 percent.

Wage-enhancing moves involved a higher skill distance than the average for all job moves 
(35 to 50 percent median across countries versus 25 to 45 percent). In other words, when 
someone made a move for higher pay, their new job typically involved significant skills and 
responsibilities that were not part of their previous job. Incremental moves, with largely 

63  This finding is consistent with research from the OECD showing that bolder (across industry and across geography) moves 
are associated with higher earnings gains. See Damien Azzopardi et al., The decline in labour mobility in the United States: 
Insights from new administrative data, OECD, 2020.

64  The skill distance between two roles refers to the nonoverlapping portion of their respective skill requirements. We 

identify skills for each role from job posting data, weighted by skill frequency, which gives more weight to skills that are 
specialized to a particular role rather than common across roles to exemplify the real distance. When someone makes a 
role move, we measure skill distance as the number of skills that are not retained from the preceding role as a proportion 
of the number of skills required in the current role. The larger the number, the “bolder” the move. An incremental move is 
one in which skill distance is in the bottom quartile of the sample; a bolder move is one in the top quartile.

Exhibit 10Moves made by workers in our sample boosted earnings by up to 30 to 45 percent while adding significant new skills.1Role moves are changes in an individual’s job, occupation, occupation category, or organization. They include promotions or lateral moves within the same organization as well as moves from one employer to another. Role moves undertaken over 2010–19 considered for analysis.2Measured as share of nonoverlapping skill requirements between two roles, which shows the proportion of new skills required when someone moves into a new role. We identify skill requirements for each role from job posting data, weighted by skill frequency, which gives more weight to skills that are specialized to a particular role rather than common across roles. Note: Based on 3.7 million role moves by 920,000 individuals in the United States, 4.1 million role moves by 930,000 individuals in the United Kingdom, 3 million role moves by 790,000 individuals in Germany, and 1.4 million role moves by 650,000 individuals in India.Source: McKinsey’s proprietary Organizational Data Platform, which draws on licensed, de-identified public professional profiledata, as well as 2018–19 job posting records; UK Office for National Statistics; US Bureau of Labor Statistics; Germany’s Federal Employment Agency, BA; India’s National Sample Survey Organisationand Periodic LabourForce Survey; McKinsey Global Institute analysis73663083210463150404944502636United StatesGermanyUnited KingdomIndiaAverage increase in salary per role move,1%All movesOnly income-increasing job movesMedian skill distance between consecutive roles,2%All movesOnly income-increasing job moves10McKinsey Global Instituteoverlapping requirements, do not pack the same punch. On the other hand, wage-reducing 
role moves involved a median skill distance of only 20 to 40 percent across countries.

An upward career move involves more than “cashing in” on the value of knowledge and skills 
already acquired. It also involves gaining the opportunity to take on new challenges and 
maintain upward momentum in the future. The new role may be a major learning opportunity, 
or it may simply be a better match that enables someone to deploy existing skills that have yet 
to be fully utilized.65 This kind of movement is enabled when an employer is willing to take a 
chance on someone’s potential, even if they have not been performing exactly the same tasks 
in their previous role.

Not everyone has the ability to land a role that represents a bigger change, however. Some 
may lack the innate abilities and educational qualifications. Others may have what it takes 
but find that employers are not willing to hire someone who doesn’t precisely fit their 
job description. Women in particular are less likely to apply for roles unless they are fully 
qualified.66 Someone who is more financially secure may be willing to take a risk because the 
consequences of failure are not as dire, but others cannot afford to take a chance—or even 
to take time off from providing for their families to look for a better opportunity. Personal 
circumstances such as caregiving responsibilities may mean that the right choice is staying 
in a position that is familiar. In a bad economy, openings may be scarce. In short, many people 
are constrained from making bold moves, but this strategy does work for those who are able 
to take advantage of such opportunities.

The most upwardly mobile cohorts in the sample make more frequent and bolder moves 
(Exhibit 11). In the United States, for example, people who moved into higher earning quintiles 
averaged 4.6 moves during the observed period, while those who stayed flat averaged 3.7 
moves. The upwardly mobile made moves with an average skill distance of 40 percent; 
those who stayed flat averaged only 30 percent. This growth in skills compounds with each 
move, resulting in a far bigger shift in capabilities and responsibilities over the entirety of 
a working life. In Germany and the United Kingdom, the workers who moved into higher 
earning quintiles averaged 5.2 and 5.3 moves, respectively, with an average skill distance of 
45 percent. Those who stayed flat averaged 4.6 to 4.7 moves, with a skill distance of 35 to 
40 percent, respectively.

How a billing clerk made moves to move up

The path of a hypothetical billing clerk illustrates how an individual can make bold 
moves. In his first role, he processes bills and payments for a small manufacturing 
company, working diligently for two years until he is promoted to become 
an accountant. 

Once he grows comfortable with that job, he begins thinking about buying a home 
and starts looking elsewhere for a job with a bigger paycheck and more growth 
potential. He finds that opportunity with a regional bank that hires and trains him to 
become a credit analyst. A few years later, the itch to reach higher returns. 

His mathematical acumen and his newfound ability to evaluate risk quantitatively 
help him land a role as an insurance underwriter. In the course of this job, he learns 
the ins and outs of the insurance industry. This readies him to eventually become 
vice president of new product development with a competing insurer. His moves 
have raised his lifetime earnings far above what he could have expected if he had 
stayed put over the years.

Indian workers tended to change roles every 4.2 years over their careers; by comparison, 
workers moved every 2.5 to 3.4 years in the advanced economies we studied. But the 
upwardly mobile workers in India did make moves with an average skill distance of 30 percent, 
vis-à-vis 20 percent for those who stayed flat.

To illustrate how movement plays out in practice, we look at individuals in our sample who 
started in specific occupations and where they would end up, given our projected lifetime 
earnings from their final observed role. Three-quarters of customer service representatives 
in the United Kingdom, for example, start in the bottom quintile of earnings (Exhibit 12). Forty-
two percent of the group would remain in the bottom quintile of lifetime earnings; half of this 
group continued as customer service representatives, while 17 percent transitioned into 
relatively similar and low-paying clerk and assistant roles. But 58 percent moved roles more 
often, and each of these moves required a bigger leap in skills, with the effects compounding 
over time. These workers added new skills like digital design engineering, solution 
architecture, and operating systems and visualization, while de-emphasizing skills like CRM 
systems and data storage. As a result, they moved into distinct new areas such as computer

A quarter of those once low-
paid customer service representatives would vault into the top two earnings quintiles.

In India, we looked at service sales representatives who started in the bottom quintile of 
earnings (Exhibit 13). Half of this group would remain at the bottom in projected lifetime 
earnings. Although there is not a great divergence in the frequency of moves made, the group 
that made moves involving sharply higher skill distances would advance into higher lifetime 
earnings brackets. These individuals built new skills like general operational capabilities, 
process management, and leadership, becoming sales managers and moving into marketing 
roles, positions with a more strategic and big-picture orientation.

in a variety of computer occupations, such as web and systems administrators, document 
management specialists, and the like (Exhibit 14). The 11 percent who moved into higher 
quintiles of earnings made more frequent moves with higher average skill distances than 
those who stayed flat, with the majority deploying higher-level technical skills such as solution 
architecture and use of development tools as computer programmers. Interestingly, almost 
a quarter of the original cohort dropped to the lowest earning quintile—and they, too, made 
moves that stretched their capabilities more than those who stayed flat. Skill distance applies 
to both upward and downward moves, since it measures simple differences rather than 
upward mobility. Some of the people who dropped down stopped specializing in computers 
altogether and took on administrative office work, which does not pay as much but still 
involves differential skills.

effective career moves

From our data set, we looked at a smaller universe of 20,000 to 60,000 people with more 
than ten years of work history. Within it, four distinct archetypes emerge. They are not meant 
to convey individuals’ circumstances or motivation; they simply describe movement patterns 
and outcomes, with illustrative examples.

Exhibit 15 shows these groupings in Germany. The patterns over the period we observed are 
remarkably consistent with those in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. The 
four archetypes are as follows:

 — Experience seekers are the smallest but most dynamic group. They start with lower-

than-average wages but propel themselves upward by switching jobs more frequently 
and stretching their capabilities substantially each time. The cumulative effect gives 
them stronger wage growth than any other archetype. Work experience accounts for 
60 to 80 percent of their lifetime earnings in the four countries we studied. A classic 
experience seeker might start as an administrative assistant at a nonprofit. As she works 
behind the scenes on the group’s big fundraising events, she learns enough to land a

Note: We describe moves involving high skill distances as “bold.” This term describes only the distinctiveness of the skill requirements in the new role; it is not a comment on the nature of the role itself or of the risk-taking involved in making the move.

We also do not know if some of the moves made by experience seekers 
led to poor fits that they addressed with additional moves.

 — Early movers make bold, decisive moves in the first part of their career. Someone may 

start in one field, quickly realize that their passion lies elsewhere, and then get a big break 
that enables them to follow it. A graphic designer who makes print ads, for example, 
might become a user-experience designer early in her career. For this group as well, work 
experience accounts for 60 to 80 percent of lifetime earnings.

 — Late movers stay put or make more incremental moves in the early stages of their 

career but eventually take a bolder step. Think of a seasoned journalist who leaves the 
newsroom and goes into corporate communications, a mechanical engineer who leaves 
the automotive industry and goes into aerospace, or a real estate agent who becomes a 
mortgage loan officer at a bank. This is by far the largest group in the sample. However, we 
do not know if they tried but did not succeed in making earlier bold moves, or if they made 
early missteps.

 — Lock-ins change jobs less frequently, and when they do move, they don’t make dramatic 
changes. This is not necessarily because someone is timid or stuck; they could also 
follow this strategy because they pursued what suited them from the start. Teachers, for 
example, may continue in the occupation because they have found their calling. Doctors 
have high sunk costs in specialized education and training, have very high starting 
salaries, and do not tend to make many moves. Other workers in this group may have 
tried to make bold moves but did not succeed in landing the opportunities. While work 
experience accounts for 60 to 70 percent of lifetime earnings for experience seekers and 
early movers in the advanced economies we studied, that share is only about 30 percent 
for lock-ins.

Experience seekers and early movers have the strongest experience effect and are able to 
translate it into higher earnings. Early, bold, and frequent movement is what propels them.67 
But they are a minority of workers. Addressing the constraints that prevent more people from 
changing roles fluidly could help to unlock more upward mobility.

The future of work creates new urgency for facilitating learning and 
role moves

David Autor, among others, has shown how automation has already disrupted career 
trajectories and lowered earnings for less educated workers.68 As the adoption of automation 
technologies accelerates, the need to enable greater movement and occupational transitions 
is gaining urgency. MGI’s previous research on automation in the workplace projects that 
significant shares of the workforce in countries around the world will need to adapt to 
changing job requirements or change roles altogether due to technological shifts.

Our analysis finds that individuals starting their careers in lower-pay, experience-reliant 
occupations are more susceptible to automation (Exhibit 16). For example, construction 
laborers, food servers, and pharmacy technicians may find themselves forced to transition to 
new occupations in order to stay employed by 2030. These transitions will determine whether 
they grow their human capital (or not). Employers, and societies more broadly, will need to 
make occupational transitions easier as more people have to undertake them, often needing 
new skills.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated another technological shift toward remote and hybrid 
work. Previous MGI research quantified the potential for remote work by occupation based on 
the average time spent performing specific tasks without loss of productivity. Applying these 
findings, we find that remote and hybrid work will intensify both opportunities and challenges 
for learning through experience.

67  Our findings align with research by Schultz, who argues that those who move early see a greater return on their investment 
in migration in search of changing job opportunities. See Theodore Schultz, “Investment in human capital,” American 
Economic Review, volume 51, number 1, 1961.

McKinsey Global InstituteOf nearly 700 occupations in our data set, 134 occupations contributing to 15 percent of the 
labor force have both high remote work potential (meaning that 21 percent or more of time can 
be spent remotely) and high reliance on experience (meaning that more than 40 percent of 
lifetime earnings are associated with work experience). These occupations include roles such 
as credit analysts, data entry keyers, and editors. Some workers may gain new opportunities 
to change into these roles and make bold moves as companies expand their hiring beyond 
traditional geographic boundaries.69

and virtual world of work. While some activities can be performed remotely without loss of 
productivity, it may become harder to deliver adequate apprenticeship and onboarding with 
reduced face-to-face interaction and fewer unplanned coaching “moments.” Sponsorship 
may be weaker for remote workers relative to those who work on-site.70

However, our analysis finds that individuals starting their careers in lower-pay, highly 
experience-reliant occupations have the lowest remote working potential (Exhibit 17). In 
166 occupations contributing to 17 percent of the labor force, potential for remote work is 
low (2 percent or less time at work can be spent remotely, without loss of productivity) but 
reliance on work experience to boost lifetime earnings is high. This group includes agricultural 
equipment workers, mechanics, and cashiers, for example. Such workers may face limited role 
mobility opportunities because they do not benefit from hybrid work, and their experience 
effect may be constrained by local economic growth and labor market dynamics.

Technological change is ongoing, and it has always restructured work activities. David Autor 
has found that the majority of jobs performed in 2018 did not exist in 1940.71 New tasks arise 
even as others are rendered obsolete. Some of the new roles that emerge may be novel 
and better compensated. What does not change, however, is the need to make it feasible 
for workers to acquire new skills and make more seamless transitions. In the chapter that 
follows, we discuss how individuals, companies, and policy makers can play a role in making 
movement and job transitions more fluid.

Composite sketches of workers in each pattern of experience building

Alice: The early mover

Alice is a young urban worker in the United Kingdom. After finishing high school, 
she spent her 20s doing a series of odd jobs, eventually becoming a service sales 
representative for a midsize regional sales company in Manchester.

After two years there, she feels uninspired by call scripts and customer prospecting, 
and there’s not much left in her paycheck after covering rent and basic expenses. 
She begins browsing job boards for other options. She sees that her prospects will 
be better if she expands her digital skills and takes four short online courses. Months 
later, feeling more prepared to branch out with her newfound basic computer skills 
and knowledge, she applies for a computer support specialist role and lands the job.

Twelve months down the line, Alice’s enthusiasm about her new job has dimmed. The 
work is well defined and simple—and no longer new. She asks her manager if the 
company has any training programs but gets a disappointing response: a push for 
cost savings has eliminated all internal talent development initiatives. Frustrated, Alice 
signs up to receive email alerts on local job vacancies. When a marketing associate 
role lands in her in-box, Alice decides to take the leap. Excited by the prospective 
career move, she spends the evening crafting a cover letter to describe how the 
computer skills and sales acumen she developed in her current and previous jobs have 
readied her for a career in digital marketing. She applies for the role and gets it.

Several years after her big break into marketing, Alice’s partner is offered a rotation at 
his company’s London office, and the couple decide to move. Seeing that her current 
employer has a long and complex process to apply for relocation to other regional 
offices, she hands in her notice and starts a search in London. She applies to be a 
performance marketing manager at a large agency. The new role is a stretch, but the 
company sees Alice’s experience and determination and decides to take a chance on 
her. After a cultural fit interview and a skills-based assessment, she is offered the job.

Now in her mid-40s, Alice is still with that agency and has been promoted to senior 
marketing manager. Her accumulated marketing experience makes her a sought-after 
expert in her firm—and she brings home an ample paycheck at the end of each month.

McKinsey Global InstituteKarla: The late mover

Karla is a high school graduate in Bonn, 
Germany, who takes an administrative job at 
a friend’s local real estate business. After 
three years, she begins to tire of her friend’s 
unstructured management. She interviews 
for a similar position at a larger regional 
brokerage. She passes the next five 
years there providing support services 
in the background. As time passes, she 
becomes interested in handling deals 
more directly and asks her manager about 
becoming one of the company’s brokers. But her manager 
passes her off to the human resources department, which never 
follows up because Karla’s background and skills appear to be a good fit for her 
current role.

Discouraged, Karla starts looking elsewhere and eventually lands a similar position with a 
competitor that emphasizes employee growth. Six months into her new role, a broker position 
opens up. Karla carefully rehearses her pitch on her motivation, transferable skills, and goals 
for the position. Her new employer recognizes her drive and potential—and is only too happy 
to go with someone who already knows how the company works. The firm not only offers her 
the job but also sends her to a series of training seminars to sharpen her sales skills, and pairs 
her up with a more senior broker who can teach her the ins and outs of the closing process.

The company’s investment in Karla pays off. Six years down the line, she has been promoted 
twice and is now regional sales manager. She is becoming known in the Bonn real estate 
market, actively mentors new hires coming from outside the industry, and is spearheading the 
company’s regional expansion plans.

Dhruv: The lock-in

Dhruv is a taxi driver who lives on the outskirts of Kolkata, India. He begins his day at 5am, 
picking up commuters who want to beat rush hour and make their way into the city center for 
work. He toggles between two ride-hailing apps to optimize incoming requests, activating one 
as he drops off a passenger from a booking via the other. To support his family, Dhruv puts in 
long hours and is often trapped in traffic jams. It is uncomfortable work that exposes Dhruv to 
the noise, heat, and pollution of Kolkata’s streets.

Dhruv works on his own terms and frequently enjoys chatting with his passengers. Not only 
has he become a capable driver and navigator; he has also developed good customer service 
skills in the course of dealing with thousands of locals and tourists over two decades. He 
dreams of a job in sales where he could put these talents to work, earning a higher and more 

stable salary to support his family and keep his two children in school.

Making a role move would require time for scouring job boards for 
suitable positions, filling out applications, and interviewing until 

he finds an employer who recognizes his talents. 

Dhruv’s busy driving schedule does not allow this 
kind of time. He wants to find a way to signal his 
potential and discover a position where he can 
thrive. He considers listing his profile on an online 
job board in the hope that it opens up a new 

career path for him.

Human capital at work: The value of experienceBill: The experience seeker

Indiana-born and -raised, Bill is a warehouse worker who lives in a small town outside 
Indianapolis. He spends 40 hours a week preparing orders and unloading merchandise. The 
work is simple, and he likes his colleagues, but the pay leaves him scrambling at the end of 
every month. Lately Bill has been on the lookout for a more challenging role with higher pay.

When he spies an opening for a quality controller position with a nearby manufacturing 
company, he applies. The hiring manager sees that the organizational skills and awareness of 
safety and process he learned in the warehouse would serve him well in the company’s plant. 
Bill lands the job.

Bill quickly settles into quality control. He monitors operations and reviews specifications 
with a keen eye; he is praised for his attention to detail and efficiency. After two years, he is 
promoted to a quality control specialist position. Yet he finds himself dissatisfied: the pay is 
slightly higher and the title slightly more impressive, but the work is largely the same.

Beginning to feel hungry for something more, Bill decides that he needs to take up a 
higher-skilled specialized trade. He spends evenings and weekends taking a course in 
electrical installation at the local community college. He quits his factory job to take on a 
paid apprenticeship and is soon launched into a new career as an electrician, working for a 
general contractor.

Eventually, he moves to Indianapolis and branches out on his own. Over time, his client base 
grows beyond residential work as he lands larger commercial projects. Through his work, 
Bill develops a keen understanding of building codes and a deeper expertise in energy 
consumption, and he builds a strong network of local colleagues and clients.

A client makes a chance remark about how the inefficiency of legacy electrical power and 
control systems is unlikely to put him out of a job anytime soon, and Bill is struck with an idea. 
Founding his own energy-efficiency consultancy could fuel the growth and excitement he has 
been seeking. He pulls together a business plan and makes his pitches. Fast-forward a year, 
and Bill is now the founder and CEO of a business specializing in smart building installations 
and operations. When the company goes public, Bill takes home a hefty payout, which he 
plans to use to fund his next venture, this time in wind energy.

4. Shaping experience: 

Opportunities 
for employers 
and workers

Since work experience creates value for the individual, how can someone maximize that 
effect? Our analysis indicates that the most influential factor for individuals is spending time in 
an effective organization early in a career. Not everyone can manage to land with an employer 
that prioritizes learning and development. But for those who can seize these opportunities, 
exercising care and self-determination in career choices can unlock higher earnings 
over time.

This chapter considers not only how individuals can think about curating a career, but also 
what it means for an employer to be an effective organization that propels people upward.

Individuals cannot make bold career moves unless an employer sees their potential and takes 
a chance on them in hiring. An untraditional candidate may seem to be a risky option with 
unproven value.72 The match is less obvious, and it requires both candidate and employer to 
agree that the candidate has the intrinsic ability to do the job. Growth and advancement occur 
when employers create opportunities for people to learn new skills or apply existing skills that 
are not being fully utilized.

If employees want and need development opportunities, companies need to consider how to 
respond, particularly in newly tight labor markets. Although warnings about an imminent “war 
for talent” have been circulating for years, many employers were taken aback by recent hiring 
difficulties and workers’ newfound leverage. At a time when automation and digitization are 
rapidly changing the skills companies need, leaders will need to adapt to a labor market that 
moves faster and rewards effective people development.

Worker mobility is like a circulatory system within the economy. When that system is healthy, it 
provides benefits to workers and companies alike. Recent OECD research finds that mobility 
is the main mechanism for workers to increase their earnings and advance their careers; it 
also ensures that businesses can quickly find the new employees they need to respond to 
growth opportunities.73 The broader economy also benefits as movement strengthens the 
overall pool of workforce skills.

Within our data set, more than 80 percent of all the role moves individuals made involved 
changing employers. Movement across companies is a reality—but not a reason to avoid 
investing in people.

Human capital at work: The value of experienceHealthy organizations that emphasize employee development are 
engines of upward mobility

The primary way for an individual to maximize the experience effect is to join an organization 
that strengthens their development. Controlling for differences in occupation, we find that 
spending time early in a career with an effective organization explains 50 percent of the 
variation in how experience adds to individuals’ earnings. The remainder of the difference is 
associated with the boldness and frequency of moves that a person makes (as discussed in 
chapter 3).

Not all companies are equally good at developing people. What sets those effective 
organizations apart? We find that smaller companies, despite not having the advantages 
of scale, are as adept in this area as larger companies. In Germany, for example, small and 
medium-size enterprises (SMEs) provide an estimated 90 percent of all vocational training.74

While size does not seem to matter, organizational health does. The top quintile of companies 
in McKinsey’s Organizational Health Index seem to propel people upward. Thirty-seven 
percent of employees with early career experience in these companies would see upward 
mobility in earnings.75  This compares with 25 percent for a company in the bottom quintile of 
organizational health (Exhibit 18). In short, organizational health is about more than company 
financial performance. It also has an impact on individual employees and their futures.

In addition, effective companies offer more structured learning and development programs 
and opportunities for internal advancement. These metrics, too, are linked to upward mobility 
for workers.

>60 hours

of training annually per  
full-time employee in 
top-quintile companies vs

Companies in the top quintile for training offer more than 60 hours of training per full-time 
employee every year; those in the bottom quintile offer only five.76 This has far-ranging ripple 
effects for workers: 37 percent of employees with early career experience in companies that 
devote more time to training are on the path to move into higher earning brackets, compared 
to only 23 percent who worked for companies in the bottom quintile.

companies

Similarly, internal moves make up 47 percent of all moves (that is, internal moves plus 
separations) at companies in the top quintile for career advancement but represent only 
18 percent of the total moves at bottom-quintile companies. We find that 34 percent of 
employees who worked for companies offering more internal career growth are on an 
upwardly mobile path, compared to 27 percent of those who worked for a company in the 
bottom quintile.

In the section that follows, we highlight some select talent programs and practices from 
individual companies. But one or two initiatives in isolation are insufficient; companies need 
to focus simultaneously on multiple fronts in order to maximize the value of human capital for 
themselves and their workers. Offering fair terms to employees is only a starting point toward 
becoming an employer of choice. It is equally important to support well-being and deliver a 
high-quality employee experience (see Box 4, “A new spotlight on employees’ happiness, 
health, and welfare”).

They include promotions or lateral moves within the same organization as well as moves from one employer to another.4We describe moves involving high skill distances as "bold." Skill distance is the share of nonoverlapping skill requirements between two roles, which shows the proportion of new skills required when someone moves into a new role. We identify skill requirements for each role from job posting data, weighted by skill frequency, which gives more weight to skills that are specialized to a particular role rather than common across roles. 5Role moves made within the company as a share of internal moves + separations; US data only.6Based on McKinsey’s proprietary Organizational Health Index (overall score).7Movement into higher earning quintiles is based on estimated lifetime earnings of the individual (compared to quintiles of starting wages), which is calculated as the sum total of the nominal salaries an individual receives over a 30-year working life.

A new spotlight on employees’ happiness, health, and welfare

Work is a large part of what goes into making a life. It dominates our waking hours, 
and for some people, it even provides a sense of identity and self-worth.1 A large body 
of literature has found a fundamental link between work and both happiness and life 
satisfaction, as work creates spillover effects in areas such as family relationships 
and physical and mental health.2 The degree to which work meets basic human needs 
for autonomy, a sense of competence, and connected relationships influences a 
person’s level of satisfaction.3 Happiness and satisfaction at work enhance employee 
engagement, learning, and, in turn, productivity.4

With workers becoming more selective and more mobile, organizations need to assess 
the totality of what they offer employees, including the quality of their experience. 
Competitive compensation is a must, particularly now that there is more pay 
transparency than ever before. But this is only the baseline.

The work environment itself needs to be a healthy setting where people can thrive, 
grow, and feel a sense of purpose. Companies need to make thoughtful choices about 
building their culture and offering a unique value proposition; those choices should be 
aligned with the type of employer the organization wants to be.

Benefit packages are one way to recognize and align with employee priorities. McKinsey 
conducted a major survey of workers in five advanced economies in 2021. Among 
respondents who had left their jobs, 45 percent cited the need to take care of family as 
an influential factor in their decision. A similar proportion of people who were thinking of 
quitting cited the demands of family care. In response, companies can consider 
expanding childcare, nursing services, or other family-focused programs. Other types 
of workplace policies, such as flexible scheduling, remote work, extended time off, and 
employee well-being programs can similarly make the employer-employee relationship 
less transactional.5

Good bosses bring about good performance. Conversely, poor management practices 
can drive attrition, erode morale, and hinder productivity. An organization’s top 
leadership needs to understand how middle managers and frontline supervisors affect 
the employee experience—and consider whether the people who make up the most 
direct layers of management need coaching in how to coach.6

McKinsey Global InstituteEmployers can attract and retain talent by recognizing potential, 
embracing mobility, and strengthening learning

Great learning organizations position themselves as “skills academies”—and they are 
magnets for talent. People join them to build knowledge and networks, understanding 
that their experience will provide a valuable signal to other employers for the remainder of 
their careers.

Within our data set, more than 80 percent of all the role moves individuals made involved 
changing employers. Employers can aim to beat the odds on both sides of this 80-20 
dynamic. On one end, they want to attract the best candidates among the big talent pool that 
is always searching. On the other, they can boost the productivity and engagement of the best 
employees who stay, hopefully retaining them for longer. We see three major priorities for 
achieving this:

Understand the potential in people as well as their current knowledge and skills
Talent matching has always been a priority for companies—and especially for large, complex 
organizations. The ability to evaluate someone’s skills, spot talent, and match people to the 
right tasks and teams is at the core of both hiring and deploying the workforce internally.

Yet the hiring process often gets bogged down when organizations try to hedge the inherent 
risks of recruitment by looking for a “unicorn” candidate whose prior experience precisely 
matches the requirements of an open role. In a world of constantly evolving technologies and 
greater mobility, excessive caution can be self-defeating. Even internally, companies tend to 
hedge risks by having people stick with the same things they already know they can do rather 
than letting them branch out.

In our sample, more than half of all role moves undertaken by individuals involved a skill 
distance of more than 25 percent. Many people have latent capabilities that are not being 
recognized by their current employer, and many have the potential to learn additional skills. 
Employers may need a new lens that is better able to see the ability of workers to evolve. 
Olympic bobsled teams, for instance, have added new dimensions of strength and speed by 
recruiting former track stars.77

Select people based on their potential as well as their past. Most employers can benefit from 
challenging the status quo of how they fill open roles. Companies need to evaluate candidates 
not only on their current responsibilities but also on their transferable skills, their intrinsic 
capabilities, and their potential to succeed in new roles. Someone who has been a waiter may 
have the people skills needed for customer service and sales, for example, while someone 
who has been a construction supervisor may be a natural in logistics. An accomplished video 
gamer might be great at directing food delivery robots.78

Part of seeing potential involves removing biases that pigeonhole people in their current roles. 
This point is particularly important when it comes to current employees. Since organizations 
typically pay a premium for external talent and cannot always know if a candidate will be a 
cultural fit, it makes sense to understand the capabilities that are already available internally, 
in proven employees, before looking for external candidates.79

Making bolder hiring decisions can involve some risk of failure, but the most effective learning 
happens when people step out of their comfort zones.80 If candidates have a track record of 
acquiring new skills over time, it probably means they are capable of adding more. The entirety 
of their journey is signaling what they can do, if potential employers pick up on those signals.

developing talent,” Harvard Business Review, June 2021.

Human capital at work: The value of experienceMake skills assessment fit for purpose. One study by the Harvard Business School and 
Emsi Burning Glass that analyzed more than 50 million job postings between 2017 and 2020 
showed that some employers are moving toward a model of hiring that is based on skills 
rather than educational credentials. Only 29 percent of IBM’s job postings contained a degree 
requirement, for example.81 Google, Hilton Hotels, and Ernst & Young are also among the 
companies that have increased their hiring of candidates without college degrees.82

Shifting to more skills-based hiring requires new techniques for assessing applicants. 
Companies now have many more digital tools at their disposal for achieving this, including 
“gamified” options for pre-employment testing. They also have much more data on the 
predictors of success, including factors beyond the candidate’s current day job. Analyzing 
the profiles and career outcomes of candidates hired versus those not hired can help an 
organization refine criteria and better predict performance outcomes. The key is for more 
companies to use such tools and to keep experimenting until they arrive at a model of skills 
assessment that is nimble, reliable, and well-tailored to current and future needs. The process 
should emphasize the core, must-have skills for a given role rather than nice-to-have or more 
generalized skills.

Be open to hiring unconventional candidates. A straight line is not the only viable path. 
Companies can tap into broader talent pools by offering roles for people who want to 
change their career trajectory. The BBC’s Apprentice Hub, for example, offers programs 
combining formal off-the-job training and work-based placements in design and technology, 
business, and production. It is available not only to recent graduates but also to those looking 
for a career change, enabling participants to earn while learning and gain a recognized 
qualification.83 Companies including Bosch and Barclays have started retraining programs to 
recruit and train workers from nontraditional backgrounds into tech roles.84 People with little 
related work experience who can demonstrate relevant skills from nonwork activities could 
be viable candidates. An Uber driver who flies drones as a hobby might have the potential to 
thrive doing aerial videography. In addition, companies need to see the potential in people 
who may have stepped off the career track for caregiving responsibilities, early retirement, 
or sabbaticals but now want to return to work. Employers could be less constrained about 
recruiting candidates from traditional sources and conventional educational backgrounds.

Embrace mobility
Employees are looking for jobs with opportunities for career progression. Establishing 
internal career tracks can reduce the likelihood that good employees have to go elsewhere to 
move up.

Set expectations that managers will develop people to go on to other things. LinkedIn’s 
Global Talent Trends 2020 research found that the chief obstacle to internal mobility is that 
managers don’t want to let go of their top team members. But 81 percent of surveyed talent 
acquisition professionals agreed that internal recruiting improves retention, and employees 
stay 41 percent longer at companies that regularly promote from within.85 In our own sample, 
we find that employers offering more internal opportunities were better enablers of future 
upward mobility. Companies can streamline any bureaucracy standing in the way of internal 
mobility and measure managers on whether their team members advance rather than solely 
on what they achieve by staying in place.

Accept that people will come and go—and celebrate talented workers who leave. Movement 
is an inherent part of the labor market—and since there is no fighting the fact that talented 
people will move, the key for employers is becoming part of this flow. Companies need to be 
recognized as employers of choice and destinations for learning to attract the best external 
talent. When good employees do move on, it’s best to celebrate them as success stories.

McKinsey Global InstituteAlumni may become valued business partners in the future. It may also be advantageous to 
welcome these “boomerang” employees back if they ever want to return in a different role, 
enriched with different experience gained elsewhere.

Emphasize lateral opportunities as much as linear progression. Mobility is about gaining 
more varied experience, not only promotions. Lateral moves can also enable people to 
recharge, expand their skills, or find a position that is a better fit. Yet most organizations 
undervalue lateral movement or make it difficult. Several large multinationals including 
Abbott, Mastercard, Honeywell, BMW, and AstraZeneca have addressed this opportunity 
by creating rotational programs that offer recent graduates exposure to multiple functions 
for one to two years.86 While these types of programs are typically geared to new hires who 
are management trainees, companies can design internal mobility options for a broader pool 
of employees. Stints in different departments or geographies can keep midcareer workers 
learning and feeling energized.

Define future career pathways. Each role within the organization should have clear—and 
clearly communicated—paths toward future roles, defined by the skills required to be 
qualified. Employees should be able to identify their next opportunities early in their tenure 
and co-create development plans with their leaders.87

One way to do this in a large organization is to create an internal digital platform where 
employees can access learning modules and find their next role. Infosys has enhanced 
its platform with a Learning and Career app and an advisory bot to give each employee 
personalized suggestions on learning, opportunities, and networking. Digital tools enable 
manageable mobile learning and gauge skill proficiency to improve these internal matches.88 
Schneider Electric has used artificial intelligence to create an internal Open Talent Market. By 
uploading their profiles to the platform, employees can get AI-suggested development and 
career opportunities based on their skills, competencies, and ambition. Schneider introduced 
this platform after learning that 47 percent of people who were leaving the company said they 
couldn’t find their next career opportunity there.89

Prioritize coaching and apprenticeship along with more effective structured learning
Companies have long grappled with the fact that developing employees may make them more 
attractive to other employers. It may seem counterintuitive to double down on learning and 
development at a time when workers are growing more mobile. In fact, it is more important 
than ever.

In a 2020 McKinsey survey of US workers who left the workforce without a job in hand, some 
one-third of respondents cited lack of career development and advancement potential as one 
of their top three reasons for quitting.90 In a June 2021 Gallup survey of 15,000 US workers, 
65 percent said that the opportunity to learn new skills is an extremely or very important 
factor in deciding whether to take a new job, and 61 percent said it was extremely or very 
important in deciding whether to stay at their current job.

Strengthen coaching. Employees need day-to-day training to improve existing skills and 
develop new skills to perform well in their current role. A great deal of this happens simply 
by doing the work, particularly if assignments and roles are designed thoughtfully, with 
development in mind. Employees benefit from getting feedback delivered in the moment by 
a manager or more senior colleague, or from applying institutional knowledge that is codified 
and referred to regularly.

Human capital at work: The value of experienceLearning could also take the form of a more structured apprenticeship program. Like many 
German companies, Siemens offers a robust apprenticeship and dual study program to help 
people who are starting their careers develop technical skills. The company also emphasizes 
lifelong learning for all of its employees, with an internal training platform that contains 
thousands of content modules.91

Emphasize structured onboarding and the new or first manager. Too many organizations 
leave new employees to sink or swim. The opportunity cost of leaving new hires to find 
their way on their own can be immense. In fact, the company is on probation during those 
first months just as much as the employee; there is greater willingness to leave in the 
initial period.92

Our research suggests that the first few years of a career are foundational. The same is true 
for the initial phase of any new job. Onboarding is much more than an orientation session. 
Thinking of it as a six-month to one-year process, with a thoughtfully created journey, is much 
more effective. Organizations can provide the tools for a running start, including mentorship 
and a manager who is committed to providing active coaching and facilitating connections. 
Healthcare company Roivant Sciences, for example, has an analyst program that pairs new 
employees with executives and experienced professionals to learn their processes for big-
picture decision-making and solving complex tasks.93

Provide in-person and personalized development. Active coaching is essential for on-the-job 
training. But in a world of virtual, remote, and hybrid working models, the ability to do casual 
check-ins or drop by someone’s office with a quick question has weakened. Many companies 
are struggling to develop new cultural norms to replicate the kind of training, learning, 
knowledge sharing, and community building that happens organically in the workplace.94 
Providing some face-to-face interaction is still important.

Improve the way formal learning programs are delivered—and measure results. In addition 
to training employees to succeed in their current roles, companies invest in their future by 
offering structured learning and development programs. Some large companies that stand 
out as skills academies have established corporate “universities” focused on learning and 
leadership development.

But creating and executing successful learning programs is no mean feat. According 
to one meta-analysis, only 10 percent of corporate learning is effective, a phenomenon 
Harvard Business School professor Michael Beer and colleagues have called the “great 
training robbery.”95

By looking at the skills needed to achieve strategic goals in the intermediate term, companies 
can determine what kind of learning content to invest in creating. McKinsey research has 
found that a varied and multichannel approach to delivering structured learning works best.96 
A mix of different types of learning modules can be employed. Forums (delivering content 
in classrooms and workshops) alone are not effective. They are better when combined with 
hands-on fieldwork to apply the new skills, plus feedback through assessments.97 In-person 
training for specific cohorts, steeped in a company’s culture, is most effective. But virtual 
workshops and self-paced digital modules can also work, and people have grown more 
comfortable with these types of teaching mediums since the pandemic. Whatever mix is 
chosen, companies need to track and measure the outcomes.

McKinsey Global InstituteConsider offering employees external learning opportunities. External experiences add 
tremendous value to people’s career trajectories. Organizations can consider offering 
externships and secondments (temporary roles in separate organizations, such as vendors, 
subsidiaries, or nonprofits) in a systematic way as part of their strategy to attract the 
best talent.

A number of large employers have partnered with universities and community colleges to 
develop vocational curricula. Intel, for example, recently partnered with Arizona’s Maricopa 
County Community College District to offer an accelerated course in semiconductor 
manufacturing to develop a skilled workforce for its local chip factories.98

Many large corporations have begun offering tuition reimbursement to help their employees 
further their education and prepare for better-paying opportunities, whether internal or 
external. Walmart, for example, fully covers tuition for employees to obtain an array of 
associate or bachelor’s degrees. Frontline associates pursuing their degrees are also eligible 
for the company’s new Home Office Pathway Experience, an eight-week training program 
that prepares them for full-time corporate roles within Walmart.99

When job switching becomes churn

Our research finds that role moves are associated with higher experience capital. They 
can boost income and advance careers. But at a certain point, role moves indicate 
dysfunction rather than healthy development and dynamism.

Moving between jobs more frequently has become more culturally acceptable. It is no 
longer an automatic red flag on a resume—until it becomes excessive. Someone who 
bounces from job to job without ever gaining traction for longer than a year eventually 
begins to send a negative signal to potential employers that they are difficult to work 
with or lack focus.

In some cases, job switching can be a symptom of economic insecurity. A significant 
share of all role moves involve layoffs, terminations, or people walking away from 
poor working conditions. Many people who work a succession of low-wage service or 
production jobs may not be gaining exposure to positive organizational practices as they 
change positions. In distressed local economies, the only options may be precarious 
jobs with no benefits. In these cases, movement speaks to a lack of opportunity—
and even in wealthy countries, entire segments of the labor market may consist of 
precarious jobs.

Organizations have to adapt to natural levels of attrition. People will always retire, 
move, or seek greener pastures. Job churn, however, is a different animal, and it can be 
damaging. Turnover is costly and time-consuming. Losing high-performing employees 
can harm productivity, morale, and institutional memory. The employees who remain 
may be left with a higher burden, which can increase their stress and raise the likelihood 
that they may be next out the door. When turnover becomes churn, employers must 
question what has gone wrong—and frequently the answer involves not offering training 
or prospects for advancement. Addressing the issue before it becomes a vicious cycle 
is critical.

69

Human capital at work: The value of experienceWorkers should navigate their careers with intention—and choose 
their employers carefully

It’s easy to feel trapped in a bad job. But for many, this could be an illusion. The pandemic 
appears to have awakened workers to that fact, and many have been voting with their feet. 
Some 47 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021.100 While this wave has been popularly 
dubbed the Great Resignation, most of the people who quit have not left the workforce. 
Instead, millions have traded in bad positions—particularly low-wage service jobs—and 
landed better jobs or become entrepreneurs. 101 Newly normalized remote and hybrid working 
models opened doors to roles and occupations that were previously geographically out 
of reach.

The wave has spread to other countries as well. Employers across Europe have reported labor 
shortages and hiring difficulties.102 China, too, is struggling to address a chronic shortage 
of labor caused by both demographic and structural factors.103 Workers are in demand and 
taking advantage of new dynamism in the labor market.

However, making role moves that result in higher pay, new skills, better matches, and an 
upward trajectory is not in the cards for everyone. Precarious finances, unaffordable housing, 
lack of digital infrastructure, caregiving responsibilities, and a lack of strong social and 
professional networks could all affect someone’s ability to make moves. In economies with a 
high proportion of low-wage service and production jobs, it is not always easy for workers to 
trade up into better opportunities.104 These limitations are particularly pronounced for women 
and minorities in low-earning, experience-reliant occupations, who may face biases and 
structural barriers in the labor market.105 In addition, in countries with high unemployment, 
workers find their options much more constrained.

The Great Resignation is nevertheless sending a clear signal. Many people have reassessed 
their lives during the pandemic. The real economic and personal costs of remaining in a job 
that leaves one stagnant have become clear to many more workers.

While higher pay often motivates people to make a move, particularly if they have been 
struggling to make ends meet, broader considerations are also in play. Many involve work-life 
balance and working conditions. Individuals who have the luxury of choosing each job move 
strategically can benefit in a more lasting way if they also focus on the learning opportunities, 
growth potential, and track record they can gain from each move.

Although the internet has given individuals more information about employers and 
opportunities, workers could make better and more informed decisions if they had even more 
transparency about which employers offer effective training, growth opportunities, and good 
management. More people would have the ability to make bolder moves if employers adopted 
the more flexible and skills-based hiring approaches discussed above. In the meantime, if 
workers lack learning opportunities with their current employers, they can tap into a growing 
array of free and low-cost online courses to seek out new skills on their own. A skills passport,

McKinsey Global Instituteespecially one focused on digital skills, can offer a sort of do-it-yourself credential to boost 
both employability and technical proficiency.106

Policy makers should recognize and encourage the role of companies 
in cultivating workforce skills

MGI’s body of research on automation and the future of work has highlighted accelerating 
shifts in the demand for skills.107 Our analysis shows that low-earning, more experience-reliant 
occupations are more susceptible to automation. Millions of midcareer workers may need to 
shift into new roles, and their prospects will often hinge on acquiring more socio-emotional 
and technological skills. Making effective vocational skills training widely available will be a 
priority, and employers will be the natural providers for a substantial portion of the workforce.

Consider ways to support workforce training. Governments can provide incentives to 
encourage corporate investment in human capital, in line with incentives provided for R&D 
and physical capital investment. A Brookings Institution study of California’s Employment 
Training Panel, an initiative that reimburses employers for investing in approved training, 
found that the program had positive and significant effects on the sales and growth of 
participating companies.108 Germany, too, has recently increased incentives for companies to 
offer vocational training.109

In addition, governments can play an important convening role for coalitions including 
employers, industry groups, educational institutions, unions, and the social sector. For 
example, the European Commission launched the Pact for Skills in 2020, working with 
European auto companies on a strategy to train 700,000 workers each year. The pact 
envisions €7 billion in annual private and public investment.110 In India, the National Skill 
Development Corporation and the Generation India Foundation launched a project to enable 
young workers to gain relevant skills.111 In the United States, the Markle Foundation’s Rework 
America Alliance is a partnership of civil rights organizations, nonprofits, employers, labor 
unions, educators, and state governments. It was created to enable individuals who do not 
have formal higher education move into higher-paying jobs.

Encourage nationally recognized credentials that verify workforce skills. Individuals 
could continually earn new, verifiable skill credentials throughout their career, through job 
experience and training programs. Governments can play a role in documenting and verifying 
them. The Europass Digital Credentials system enables students and workers from across 
the European Union to establish a file that employers across countries can understand.112 
The US Chamber of Commerce Foundation and the Lumina Foundation have launched the 
T3 Innovation Network to create an open data ecosystem to centralize information on skills, 
credentialing, and the needs of the economy; one of its goals is to standardize how skills are 
defined across industries and employers. The US nonprofit Credential Engine is creating an 
online registry to make information about the thousands of varying credentials across the 
country more transparent and searchable.113

Human capital at work: The value of experienceReassess whether labor markets enable healthy worker mobility. Fluid labor markets 
minimize constraints on job switching, while rigid ones make seamless transitions to new 
opportunities more difficult. Regulation should be periodically reassessed to ensure that 
it supports a healthy dynamic and reflects current realities. When many vocations have 
licensing requirements or industries impose noncompete contracts, this raises barriers to 
entry and hinders the matching process between job seekers and vacancies. High housing 
costs, too, can make it difficult for job seekers in distressed regions to move to cities with 
better opportunities.114 Policy interventions may be needed on all of these fronts.

Invest in the foundational elements of health and education. While the Great Resignation 
unfolds in more prosperous parts of the world, workers are facing an entirely different set 
of challenges in developing economies. In poorer countries where vaccine rollouts have 
lagged and pandemic-related disruptions have persisted, employment has yet to bounce 
back. The International Labour Organization notes, for example, that the recovery from the 
pandemic-related downturn in Latin America and the Caribbean has been led by growth in 
low-wage informal jobs.115 It is more difficult to deliver and coordinate skills development in 
countries with large informal sectors. But informal employment declines with higher levels of 
educational attainment.116 The priority for the poorest countries remains investing in childhood 
health and improving education systems. Focusing on the earlier stages of human capital 
development is foundational to creating opportunities for rewarding work and upward mobility 
in the later stages.

States 2020; and David Schleicher, Stuck! The law and economics of residential stability, Yale Law & Economics research

A. Glossary

Role is defined as a combination of an individual’s job (e.g., manager versus senior manager), 
occupation (e.g., general and operations manager versus training and development 
manager), occupation category (managers versus business and legal professionals), and the 
organization in which they work.

Role move is a change in an individual’s job, occupation, or organization. It includes 
promotions or lateral moves within an organization as well as moves from one employer to 
another. Role moves could be driven by quits as well as firings and layoffs.

Entry-level skills are the skills that an individual possesses when they begin working in their 
first role. These are measured as the skills required for the starting role, not an individual’s 
educational qualification or specialization. However, many of these skills may have been 
acquired through education.

Work experience encompasses the accumulated knowledge that workers gain by being in 
the labor market. This can occur through doing the work itself, formal employee-provided 
learning and development programs, job changes that better match existing skills, and 
acquiring new skills through role changes.

Work experience–driven skills are the additional skills gained or demonstrated at all 
subsequent roles after the starting role, as well as the deepening of existing skills.

Skill distance is the nonoverlapping portion of skills required between sequential role moves. 
It is measured as the weighted measure of skills that are newly acquired or deployed in the 
current role with respect to the preceding role as a proportion of the weighted measure of 
skills required in the current role. It is, therefore, an indicator of the boldness of a move. An 
incremental move is one where skill distance is in the bottom quartile of the sample, whereas 
a bolder move is one in the top quartile. The skills are weighted by skill frequency, which gives 
more weight to skills that are unique to a particular role rather than common across roles.

Lifetime earnings is a summation of an individual’s salaries over a 30-year working life. 
Salaries are defined as the average yearly compensation provided for physical and knowledge 
work, not including benefits such as health insurance, subsidies, and tax transfers.

Experience capital is the share of lifetime earnings associated with skills learned through 
experience. We attribute the entire entry-level salary to the entry-level skills associated with 
the first job; some of these skills were acquired through education. Then we look at each 
role change and note the share of new or nonoverlapping skills associated with the new role, 
compared to entry-level skills, and then attribute an equivalent proportion of the newer job’s 
salary to work experience. We assume standard yearly salary raises for the occupation for the 
length of time an individual holds a given job, based on historical rates of wage growth for the 
occupation in their country, and attribute these increases in earnings to work experience. We 
also refer to this as “share of lifetime earnings associated with work experience,” “experience-
reliant lifetime earnings,” “experience-driven lifetime earnings,” or the “experience effect.”

Human capital at work: The value of experienceOccupational categories are groupings of occupations requiring a similar set of knowledge, 
skills, and abilities. For example, general and operational managers, construction managers, 
and industrial production managers all fall within the occupation category of “managers.”

Occupations are based on data from job postings and the Occupational Information Network, 
O*NET. Each occupation requires a different mix of knowledge, skills, and abilities, and is 
performed through a variety of activities and tasks.

Role trajectory is the path that an individual follows. It is determined by the type of role moves 
someone makes (incremental versus bolder) and the timing of those moves (throughout 
their working life versus early versus late versus seldom). Based on these trajectories, we 
characterize individuals as experience seekers, early movers, late movers, or lock-ins.

McKinsey Global InstituteB. Methodology

This appendix provides methodological details on the following analyses:

1. Lifetime earnings

2. Skill distance per role move

3. Salary change per role move

4. Experience share of lifetime earnings

5. Drivers associated with experience capital

Our analysis uses proprietary information from McKinsey’s Organizational Data Platform, 
which draws on licensed, de-identified data from millions of online public professional profiles. 
We also use data from 350 million job posting records over 2018 and 2019 from more than 
50,000 job boards to estimate the typical starting salary and skill requirements of each role. 
All data have been de-duplicated, cleaned, and harmonized into 4,000 roles and 220 skills 
using a proprietary algorithm to ensure accurate comparisons of roles, salaries, and skills.

For our analyses, we created a “worker data set” of roles, role moves, salaries, and skill 
distances between moves for a randomized subset of work histories through 2019 for 
approximately a million workers each in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, 
and India (Exhibit A1). The focus countries were chosen to represent advanced economies 
with varying labor markets plus a large and diverse developing economy. The sample was 
reweighted to reflect each country’s occupational mix, drawing on data from national 
labor agencies.

Lifetime earnings

We estimate lifetime earnings for a subset of 1.15 million workers (~410,000 individuals in 
the United States, ~230,000 in the United Kingdom, ~280,000 in Germany, and ~230,000 
in India) who list some education as part of their online professional profiles. We restrict 
our observations to only those roles held after an individual obtains his or her latest 
educational degree.

The sample is randomized and de-identified. We examined work histories only for occupations 
that had at least a 1 percent ratio of share in sample to share in population. We acknowledge 
that data on work histories will likely overrepresent certain occupations over others. For 
example, occupations such as managers are overrepresented, while others such as cement 
masons or taxi drivers are underrepresented in our sample. Consequently, the sample 
is reweighted to reflect each country’s 2019 occupational mix (based on data from the 
US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the UK Office for National Statistics, the German Federal 
Employment Agency, BA, and India’s National Sample Survey Organisation and Periodic 
Labour Force Survey). This makes it possible to draw conclusions about all workers, not only 
high-skill workers with online profiles. Using reported counts per occupation in each country, 
we are able to give more weight to individuals in underrepresented occupations and less 
weight to individuals in overrepresented occupations.

The exact weight given to an individual of current occupation is given as

Earnings to date. We use job postings (rather than government statistics) as the base 
source for salaries to give our estimates more granularity (for example, incorporating not 
only job category but also industry and job title keywords like “senior,” “junior,” and others). 
We supplement salary estimates from job postings with reported statistics from government 
agencies. The government statistics enable us to estimate changes in salaries over time, 
as job posting data do not cover a large time period in a given country. In India, where job 
posting data are not available, our salary estimates are based on government-reported 
statistics alone.

we take the simple average of the minimum and maximum salaries reported.118 In this model, 
occupations are defined as a seven-digit O*NET code for all countries. For countries whose 
reported primary occupation code is not O*NET (for example, ISCO, UK SOC), we first map the 
local occupation code to O*NET.

117  In every country, a number of O*NET codes are present in the work histories from McKinsey’s Organizational Data 

Platform that cannot be matched to a code in the government-reported statistics. For the United States and the United 
Kingdom, these unresolved codes are given their own category and are weighted up to the proportion that is not covered 
by the observed sample. For India and Germany, these unresolved codes are dropped from the analysis.

118  Some job postings report hourly wages or other non-salary numbers that are mistaken as salaries. We impose a filter that 
drops any job posting whose listed salary figure is below an expected minimum earning in the given country (e.g., $15,000 
for the United States, £8,000 for the United Kingdom).

Using the coefficients from the log-linear model, we are then able to estimate the salary for 
every job role at every point in time. In addition, we assume standard yearly salary increases 
for the occupation for the length of time an individual holds a given job (including the first 
job), based on historical rates of wage growth for the occupation in their country.119 We 
then map the work histories of individuals (that is, their job role at every point in time) to the 
corresponding salaries.

Projected future earnings. Outside each individual’s observed work history, we estimate 
earnings over the remaining years of a 30-year working life. We apply an average salary 
growth at an occupation level in the corresponding countries to the final observed role, 
assuming no further role moves. For example, we would project 25 years for an individual 
whose observed job history is five years; likewise, we would project only five years for an 
individual whose observed job history is 25 years. We do not assume any further role moves 
during the projected future earnings period.

In exhibits, lifetime earnings are indexed to 100 (with average across sample = 100) for ease 
of analysis.

2. Skill distance per role move

We estimate skill distance by looking at the skill requirements associated with jobs that an 
individual holds. We restrict our observations to only those role moves that occurred after an 
individual obtained his or her latest educational degree.

We use job posting data to estimate required skills for each role, using a data set of 
20.9 million aggregated job postings from more than 50,000 job boards. This includes 
12.6 million job postings for 705 O*NET categories in the United States in 2019, 1.7 million job 
postings for 686 O*NET categories in Germany in 2018–19, and 6.6 million job postings for 111 
O*NET categories in the United Kingdom in 2019. For India, skills are estimated using US and 
UK job postings. To identify the skills required for a given role, we consider only the skills that 
appear in at least 60 percent of the job listings for the role.

We calculate skill distance per role move for a subset of 3.3 million workers (~920,000 
individuals in the United States, ~790,000 in Germany, ~930,000 in the United Kingdom, 
and ~650,000 in India) with some education listed on their online professional profiles. These 
profiles are from McKinsey’s proprietary Organizational Data Platform, described above. We 
restrict the sample to only those individuals who made a change in job roles after 2010 in 
order to manage sample size and ensure recency in the data analyzed.

119  To estimate salary change over time for each role, we use data at the standard occupation category level from the US 

Bureau of Labor Statistics, the UK Office for National Statistics, Germany’s Federal Employment Agency, BA, and India’s 
National Sample Survey Office and Periodic Labour Force Survey.

We calculate salary change per role move for the same subset of individuals for whom we 
calculate skill distance per role move. We do this to draw insights on upward mobility for 
workers in the four countries of interest and to understand the financial incentives (or lack 
thereof) for moving roles. We restrict our observations to only those role moves occurring 
after an individual obtains his or her latest educational degree. We calculate the percent 
change in salaries between the source and destination jobs, as follows:

As discussed in Box 3 (found in Chapter 2), our data set does not capture all of the variations in 
pay offered by different employers and how this might vary for employees with different levels 
of seniority and performance. Individual online profiles do not contain information on the

4. Experience share of lifetime earnings

We estimate the share of lifetime earnings that can be attributed to work experience for 
a subset of 1.15 million workers (~410,000 individuals in the United States, ~280,000 in 
Germany, ~230,000 in the United Kingdom, and ~230,000 in India) containing information 
on education. This enabled us to look at the contribution of entry-level skills vis-à-vis skills 
gained or deployed through work experience to lifetime earnings.

McKinsey & Company

We restrict our observations to only those roles held after an individual obtains his or her 
latest educational degree. The starting salary for an individual’s first job is fully attributed to 
entry-level skills that person brought into the labor force.

After an individual’s first job, the earnings attributed to entry-level skills are calculated as 
the starting salary at the current job times one minus the skill distance between the current 
job and the first job. Any remaining salary is attributed to work experience. We make this 

80

McKinsey Global Institute 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assumption because work experience is the arena in which an individual is able to acquire and 
deploy new skills after formal education. While education and personal attributes have an 
enduring impact on earnings, our approach makes a simplifying assumption on the attribution 
of salary to skills to capture the scope and direction of the experience effect.

In addition, we assume standard yearly salary raises for the occupation for the length of time 
an individual holds a given job (including the first), based on historical rates of wage growth for 
the occupation in their country. We attribute these increases in earnings to work experience. 
This means that even a person who never makes a job move would have some experience 
effect on earnings over time. At the end of an individual’s observed work history, but before 
30 years of earnings have been recorded for the individual, we apply standard yearly salary 
increases based on the average national wage growth for the individual’s final observed 
occupation until 30 years of earnings are recorded. We attribute all future projected wage 
growth to work experience. The rationale for making this assumption is that any increase in 
salary in a given role is considered to represent the individual becoming better at deploying 
the skills needed for the job.

We measure the experience share of lifetime earnings in absolute terms; it is the sum of 
the product of skill distance per role move (compared to entry-level skills) and earnings 
in the newer role (see section 3, above, for more detail on the definition and calculation of 
skill distance).

We are conservative in assuming only an average increase in salary based on the terminal 
occupation, with no additional role move premium over the remainder of an individual’s 
working life. But if we were to assume that the individual continues to make role moves during 
the projected period with the same frequency and skill distance as in the observed period, 
the experience share of lifetime earnings would increase. The average share would become

In Exhibit 5 (Chapter 2), we observe that the share of earnings from entry-level skills dips 
around the third year of work history and then stabilizes. This is due to the following factors:

1.  The full amount of the salary an individual earns in the first job after education is linked to 

entry-level skills.

McKinsey & Company

2. 

In our sample, an average individual makes a role move about every three years, usually 
involving a skill distance of about 30 percent.

3.  Consequently, in the new role, about 30 percent of the new salary is attributed to 

experience and 70 percent to entry-level skills. Therefore, there is a dip in the share of 
entry-level skills roughly three years into the work history. However, the absolute value of 
entry-level skills can increase or decrease based on the total salary increase.

4. 

In addition, we assume standard yearly salary raises for the occupation, for the length 
of time an individual holds a given job, based on historical rates of wage growth for the 
occupation in their country. We attribute these increases in earnings to work experience, 

81

Human capital at work: The value of experience 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as any increase in salary in a given role is considered to be representative of the individual 
becoming better at deploying the skills needed for the job through on-the-job learning.

5.  After the first role move, every role move is on average slightly more distant from the 

entry-level skills, and therefore the proportion of entry-level skills continues to decrease.

Take for example, someone who starts as a marketing assistant with an observed work history 
of 10 years.

Observed work history
Y1: Marketing assistant | Salary = 100 | Entry-level skills = 100 (100%) | Experience = 0 (0%)

Y2: Marketing analyst | Salary = 115 | Skill change versus entry-level role = 35% | Entry-level 
skills = 75 (65%) | Experience = 40 (35%)

Y3: Marketing analyst | Standard yearly growth = 2.4% | Salary = 118 | Entry-level skills = 75 
(63%) | Experience = 43 (37%)

Y4: Accounts coordinator | Salary = 128 | Skill change versus entry-level role = 40% | Entry-
level skills = 77 (60%) | Experience = 51 (40%)

Y5: Data analyst | Salary = 134 | Skill distance versus entry-level role = 45% | Entry-level skills 
= 74 (55%) | Experience = 60 (45%)

Y6: Data analyst | Standard yearly growth = 2.2% | Salary = 137 | Entry-level skills = 74 (54%) | 
Experience = 63 (46%)

Y7: Sales analyst | Salary = 137 | Skill change versus entry-level role = 45% | Entry-level skills 
= 74 (55%) | Experience = 63 (45%)

Y8: Senior sales analyst | Salary = 162 | Skill change versus entry-level role = 50% | Entry-
level skills = 81 (50%) | Experience = 81 (50%)

Y9: Project manager | Salary = 200 | Skill change versus entry-level role = 60% | Entry-level 
skills = 80 (40%) | Experience = 120 (60%)

Y10: Senior analytics manager | Salary = 225 | Skill change versus entry-level role = 65% | 
Entry-level skills = 79 (35%) | Experience = 146 (65%)

Projections of earnings
Y30: Standard yearly growth = 2.3% | Salary = 355 | Share of entry-level skills = 79 (22%) | 
Share of experience = 276 (78%)

The value of entry-level skills remains constant over the projected period as we assume 
standard yearly raises for the projected period, based on historical rates of wage growth for 
the occupation, and attribute these increases in earnings to work experience.

Share of experience and entry-level skills
Summing up year-on-year for the entire period of 30 years, the share of total lifetime 
earnings attributed to experience is 67 percent and the share attributed to entry-level skills is 
33 percent.

McKinsey Global Institute5. Drivers associated with experience capital

We ran a regression to explain the metrics associated with experience capital for a subset 
of individuals whose reported work experience began with employment in companies for 
which financial, proprietary Organizational Health Index by McKinsey, and training data are 
available.120 This subset consisted of ~48,000 individuals in the United States (who worked for 
299 companies), ~11,000 individuals in the United Kingdom (who worked for 40 companies), 
~1,000 individuals in Germany (who worked for five companies), and ~5,000 individuals in 
India (who worked for 18 companies).

The drivers associated with experience capital variation (controlling for starting occupation 
and sector) were measured through regressing experience capital for an individual on metrics 
measuring organizational practices of starting firm, boldness of role moves, and frequency of 
role moves made by workers.

We considered the following control variables: first wage, latest wage, years of post-
education observed experience, average experience capital for a given occupation, sector, 
and organization. The number of observations (individuals) was 65,554 in 362 companies.

We first regress the dependent variable of experience capital with the independent variables 
of metrics associated with early-career exposure to effective organizational practices: overall 
organizational health (as measured with the proprietary Organizational Health Index by 
McKinsey diagnostic), financial performance, average training hours per full-time employee, 
and share of internal migrations (that is, internal role moves as a share of internal role moves 
plus separations). We find an R-squared of 27 percent.121

We next regress the dependent variable of experience capital with the independent variables 
of metrics associated with early exposure to effective organizational practices as well as 
those associated with role mobility and bolder role moves (the number of role moves and the 
average skill distance between moves). We find an R-squared of 54 percent. The difference 
between the first and second model R-squared values, 27 percent, is associated with role 
mobility and bolder role moves. All metrics are found to be statistically significant.

120 Company financial data from McKinsey Corporate Performance Analytics Tool, S&P Global, Organizational Health Index 
data from proprietary McKinsey sources, and training data from Refinitiv. N = 65,554 individuals from 362 companies.
121  Based on metrics from the Organizational Health Index by McKinsey that focus on creating career opportunities and firm 
financial performance. The highest-performing firms in the OHI may attract a greater proportion of intrinsically motivated 
talent. These individuals may be disproportionately likely to seek opportunities for developing new skills through 
experience, amplifying this metric. Scores matched to the organization where an individual worked during the observed 
period; n = 362 firms.
