Net-zero steel in  
construction: The way 
forward

Rising demand for greener approaches creates an imperative for the 
industry to seize the moment, adopt new mindsets, and set standards 
for the transition to a greener future.

From houses to bridges, hospitals, and 
skyscrapers, the construction industry is 
responsible for approximately 25 percent of global 
emissions,1 about a third of which are associated 
with the construction process.2 One reason for 
that heavyweight impact is that the industry is a 
voracious consumer of steel, accounting for more 
than 50 percent of global demand.3 Steel is a 
carbon megaproducer due to the energy used in its 
production4 and is responsible for about a quarter 
of emissions in the building construction process. 
Given these powerful impacts, there is an urgent 
need for decision makers in steel and construction 
to take stock, consider options for decarbonization, 
and plot a realistic path forward.

Under the Paris Agreement on climate change, 
governments pledged to keep global warming 
below 2°C above preindustrial levels, ideally below 
1.5°C. To achieve that goal, net human emissions 
of greenhouse gas (GHG) must fall to zero by 2050. 
In the construction sector, massive changes are 
required to align with that pathway. However, a 
significant step forward would be to shift from high-
CO2 steel to near-zero-emissions steel.

Partial steel decarbonization is possible with 
modern furnace technologies—the most efficient 
of which are powered by natural gas and use 
comparably energy-efficient direct reduced iron 
or hot briquetted iron (NG DRI/HBI+EAF) to make 
steel. These emit much less GHG than coke-fueled 
blast furnaces or basic oxygen furnaces (BF/
BOFs), which account for 73 percent of global 
production and are still dominant in Europe, China, 
and elsewhere. 

Another route to lower-CO2 steel would be to 
retrofit BF/BOFs for carbon capture and storage 
(CCS) or carbon capture and utilization (CCU). This 
technology can be a near-zero-emissions steel 
technology, contingent on a CO2 capture rate of 
90 percent, but the approach is not yet proven at 
scale and is significantly costly.

The “North Star” for decarbonization would be to 
scale hydrogen-reduced DRI/HBI EAF furnaces 
powered with renewable energy. With this 
combination, producers could make steel with a 
carbon intensity of less than 0.2 metric tons of 
CO2 (tCO2) per metric ton of steel. Still, the cost 
would be high. The steel produced in an EAF using 
hydrogen-reduced DRI would need to command a 
“green premium” of about 20 percent over 20 years 
to fund construction of the DRI plant and EAF (not 
including the capital expenditure for hydrogen 
production, transport, and storage).

To demonstrate the potential for construction 
to adopt greener steel, this paper presents an 
illustrative marginal-abatement cost curve for 
the materials and construction of an eight-story 
commercial office building.5 In a business-as-
usual scenario, total embodied carbon in the 
construction phase would be about 1,900 tCO2, of 
which approximately 85 percent would be from 
materials.6 Of that, some 25 percentage points 
would be associated with steel (and 37 percentage 
points with concrete).7 The analysis shows it would 
be possible to reduce embodied carbon in the 
building by about 1,250 metric tons (or 70 percent), 
using alternative technologies, materials, and 
steel-production methods that will be widely 
commercially available by 2030. This would

4 A significant portion of steel consumption in building and construction is from “long” products, which—in the United States—are most 
commonly produced through electric-arc furnaces (EAF) that have a lower CO2 emissions intensity per metric ton of steel.
5 For illustrative purposes only. Regional differences and differences in the construction type of the building (for example, cast-in-place versus 
hybrid versus structural steel) have a significant impact on both overall emissions and on abatement potential of different levers.

in the cost of building materials. A reduction of 
approximately 25 percent would be achievable with 
current technologies.

Still, technical and economic feasibility is only 
half the battle. The other half is implementation, 
adoption, and scaling. Here we set out five actions 
the public and private sector must take to drive the 
green-steel agenda: agree to common standards 
and promote transparency; encourage participation 
by fostering visibility; unlock end-user demand 
(for example, through a buyers’ club for near-zero-
emissions steel); tilt capital formation toward near-
zero-emissions steel; and promote learning and 
disseminate knowledge. In a fast-changing demand 
landscape, these actions would accelerate the 
decarbonization of the construction sector, with 
greener steel playing a leading role.

Steel, construction, and carbon:  
The state of play 
Globally, there are two dominant modes of 
steel production. The first is based on BF/BOF 
technology, which blows currents of air to turn 
iron ore, mixed with coal and smelting agents 
such as limestone, into molten metal. The second 
dominant mode is electric-arc furnace (EAF) 
technology. EAFs use electricity passed through 
giant electrodes to create a fiery arc in which 
the temperature reaches 3,000°C. The furnaces 
often process recycled scrap metal and scrap 
substitutes including pig iron and DRI, which is 
made using natural gas, to produce steel. Today, 
BF/BOFs emit around 2.5 tCO2 per metric ton of 
steel, while NG DRI/HBI+EAFs emit 0.5 tCO2 per 
metric ton or less, depending on the share of scrap 
and energy source.8

Steel CO2 emissions intensity is due to three 
process steps: raw-material preparation, 

ironmaking, and steelmaking. Raw-material 
preparation requires heating metallurgical or 
coking coal to 1,100°C to create coke and an 
agglomeration of iron fines, either producing sinter 
or pellets. Ironmaking can be in either BF or DRI 
furnaces. In BF, coke and iron ore sinter or pellets 
are combined, whereas in DRI, iron ore pellets are 
directly reduced to purer iron using natural gas. 
Subsequent steelmaking from iron can be through 
either combining the iron ore with a small amount of 
carbon in a basic oxygen furnace or combining DRI-
based iron, pig iron, or both with scrap in a cleaner 
electric-arc furnace. Modern versions of BF/BOF 
technology account for about 73 percent of global 
steel production, with significant variations by 
geography. More energy-efficient EAFs account for 
about 27 percent of production.

Construction companies are not operating in 
a vacuum. Indeed, they face rising pressure to 
decarbonize from end buyers, investors, and 
regulators. In addition, some governments have 
passed legislation to drive the change agenda. 
Measures include Denmark’s limit of 12 kilograms of 
carbon-dioxide equivalent emitted per square meter 
(CO2e/m2) per year for new buildings larger than 
1,000 square meters9 and California’s Buy Clean 
California Act (BCCA), which sets limits on global-
warming potential for structural steel, concrete-
reinforcing steel, flat glass, and mineral wool board 
insulation.10 Amid increased focus on Scope 3 
emissions, institutional investors are also engaged 
as they seek to cut emissions from their portfolios. 

Against this background, what is preventing the 
construction sector from moving to green—or 
greener—steel? The reality is that, despite tailwinds, 
companies face significant commercial, structural, 
and regulatory barriers. The sector’s generally 
low margins are a limiting factor, dampening 
steel producers’ appetites for investing in green 
technologies.11 Established approaches produce

to measure embodied carbon (contained in 
construction materials from extraction to use).12 
Indeed, no certification or grading system has been 
widely adopted to date.13

Another barrier to adoption is that individual 
developers do not routinely count emissions from 
the steel they consume because of a combination 
of factors, including a lack of industry standards, 
patchy regulation, and the absence of tools 

The third significant barrier to adoption 
is that the steel industry services a highly 
fragmented construction landscape (Exhibit 1). 
In North America and Europe, the value chain 
is characterized by multiple intermediaries—

produce hydrogen and CO2 and then storing the 
CO2 underground. A still cleaner approach is to 
use electrolysis to separate hydrogen from water, 
producing “green hydrogen.”

One approach to reducing the CO2 intensity of 
steel is to retrofit existing facilities, using maturing 
technologies to develop cleaner processes. An 
example is CCS and CCU. We estimate that 
1.9 tCO2 per metric ton of steel could be reduced in 
BF/BOF with CCS and CCU retrofit, if 90 percent 
CO2 capture rate is achieved. CCS and CCU are 
maturing technologies and the precise balance 
of CO2 management and CO2 direct avoidance 
will depend on location-specific circumstances. 
However, there are significant limitations to this 
approach, including public and political skepticism 
(for example, historical opposition in Germany, a 
major steelmaking country), potential concerns 
relating to leakage from long-term geological 
storage,14 and high capital costs (more than 
$250 per metric ton of steel).15 Furthermore,  
while technologies such as CCS will go some 
way toward greening the steel industry, they are 
unlikely by themselves to be sufficient to get to 
net zero. One reason is that they leave residual 
emissions, due to partial capture rates that can 
only be abated at a cost. Steel producers need to 
weigh the costs of achieving higher capture rates 
and managing residual emissions early in the 
decision-making process.

Fully decarbonizing steel production requires 
a more fundamental switch. Among current 
technologies, the most promising are based on 
hydrogen. Most hydrogen production consists of 
“gray hydrogen,” made through a process called 
steam methane reforming (SMR). This creates a gas 
composed of about one-tenth hydrogen and nine-
tenths CO2. By contrast, cleaner “blue hydrogen” 
involves combining fossil fuels with steam to 

Hydrogen is already used in ironmaking as a 
reduction agent, but has not yet been deployed 
at scale in steel production. One use case is as an 
alternative injection material to PCI (pulverized 
coal injection, a modern replacement for coke) in 
BF/BOF environments. This use can cut emissions 
by up to 30 percent but does not offer carbon-
neutral potential, because significant coking coal 
is still required. Conversely, hydrogen-reduced 
DRI/HBI+EAF and renewable power would have 
a potential carbon intensity of less than 0.2 tCO2 
per metric ton of steel, compared with a current NG 
DRI+EAF (100 percent scrap EAF has limitations in 
sheet production). 

Offsetting hydrogen’s benefits is its high cost. 
Despite being one of the most abundant elements 
on Earth, the gas barely exists in its pure form and 
must be extracted from compounds in an energy-
intensive process. No steel producer has found an 
economically viable way to operate green hydrogen-
reduced DRI/HBI+EAF (which currently costs 
approximately $5 per kilogram)16 at scale. However, 
more than 25 projects are under development.17 
Other limitations include the availability and quality 
of scrap, especially outside the United States, 
and access to renewable power.18 Still, as green-
hydrogen technologies mature over the coming 
years, costs are expected to fall.

Apart from green-hydrogen development, several 
alternative technologies are starting to make 
a mark. These include ore electrolysis, which 
separates metallic iron from the oxygen to which 
it is bonded in iron ore, and ore smelting reduction 
(to produce pig iron at a lower energy intensity

Decarbonization levers in B&C 
projects: An illustrative case study
In the normal course of business, construction 
projects are broadly categorized as residential, 
infrastructure, or commercial. In the residential 
space, demand is mainly driven by factors such as 
price and location. Infrastructure projects such as 
bridges, highways, and railways are mostly publicly 
led investments, so they are subject to the vagaries 
of policy and funding. A first step toward wider use 
of greener steel in that space would be a change 
in procurement terms—requiring a marked shift 
away from the dominance of least-cost tendering.19 
Of the three categories, commercial projects offer 
the most immediate potential for deployment of 
decarbonized steel at scale. 

an increasingly important differentiator.20 LEED-
certified21 office buildings in US Class A urban 
markets have achieved a 21.4 percent higher 
average market sales price per square foot over the 
past three years.22 Though embodied carbon is not a 
mandatory requirement for LEED certification, most 
LEED-certified office buildings are managed with 
low-carbon strategies.

To gauge the potential cost of abatement 
in a commercial setting, we measured the 
decarbonization potential of an illustrative eight-
story commercial office building with a footprint 
of approximately 10,000 square feet (Exhibit 3).23 
In a business-as-usual scenario, total embodied 
carbon for the building would be about 1,900 metric 
tons, of which approximately 85 percent would 
be from building materials.24 Of that total, some 
37 percentage points would come from concrete 
and 25 percentage points from steel.25

A supportive factor for greening of the commercial 
development sector is that the sector is 
characterized by a relatively low price elasticity of 
demand. In addition, environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) considerations are becoming 

The analysis shows that alternative technologies, 
materials, and steel production processes could 
reduce the embodied carbon in the same building to 
around 600 metric tons (approximately 70 percent 
reduction in emissions) by 2030. Given a 10 percent

premium on steel (assuming green-hydrogen based 
DRI EAF represents 40 percent of steel in building 
and construction), the overall increase in building 
costs would be 1 percent (Exhibit 4).

In modeling the decarbonization pathway for 
the office building, we assessed more than 25 
individual levers.26 These can be grouped under five 
decarbonization categories (Exhibit 5): 

1.  Seek out efficiency in construction materials 
and design. These are no-regret priorities 
that, by definition, will lower material and 
construction costs. Examples include hollow-
core buildings, thinner load-bearing walls, 
and modern insulation. A change in materials 
mix could also contribute. Moving from 
“cast in place” buildings to hybrid buildings 
with concrete core and steel frames could 
significantly lower embodied CO2 emissions by 
reducing concrete usage.27

26 The CO2 abatement curve is an illustrative example. Regional differences (for instance, in steel production, technology, or materials availability) 

can significantly change the levers. The mentioned costs are aggregated for the eventual lever. 

27 Seeking out efficiency in construction materials and design, assumes no incremental cost to reduce waste, and only cost saving from 

higher efficiency, including hollow-core design and reduction of bearing-walls. For concrete, typical waste of 4.0 percent can be reduced to 
2.0 percent with best practices; for steel, typical waste of 10.0 percent can be reduced to 5.0 percent with best practices; for gypsum, typical 
waste of 22.5 percent can be reduced to 15.0 percent.

Note: Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rrounding. Results assume a 40 percent share of green hydrogen-based DRI EAF steel and a 60 percent 
share of EAF-based secondary steel. In Europe and the United States, many construction applications, such as rebar, are made entirely from secondary steel. 
However, there are limits to using secondary steel in construction due to supply constraints and metallurgical requirements of certain applications, such as 
steel sheets in composite slabs, roof purlins, and plate structures. A 20 to 25 percent premium on H2-DRI EAF steel would imply an overall increase in steel 
premium of 10 percent.

4Mechanical, electrical, fire protection, and plumbing works. 5Includes external development, car stackers, and furniture.

2.  Migrate to lower-CO2 steel. Moving from BF/
BOF to EAF steel would have an immediate 
impact on embodied carbon (more than 
100 metric tons of embodied CO2 in our 
example, or more than 8 percent of total 
abatement potential). However, this measure 
would not change steel emissions on a 
macro level, due to leakage of demand to 
high-CO2 production routes. Breakthrough 
steelmaking technologies include hydrogen-
reduced DRI/HBI+EAF and are a potentially 

powerful decarbonization lever. However, 
this solution carries a larger premium due to 
lower technology readiness. The green-steel

emissions: 1,880 tCO2

Abatement potential in 2030, tCO2 

Compared with “cast-in-place” buildings, hybrid buildings with a concrete core and steel frame can significantly lower 
embodied CO2 emissions by reducing concrete usage. Using structural steel instead of reinforced concrete can significantly 
reduce emissions.

Note: The horizontal axis shows the abatement potential of the technology switches. The vertical axis displays the average abatement cost as $ per metric ton 
of CO2 (tCO2) for each switch. “Concrete” includes concrete foundations, basement walls, basement slabs, ground-floor slabs, typical floor slabs, columns, 
load-bearing walls, and concrete blocks for the facade, stairs, and roof screed. This assumes no interactions in emissions abatement among different levers 
for the same material. This assumes 25% of concrete emissions and 15% of steel emissions are not abatable—eg, due to residual positive emissions from 
“green-steel” technologies—eg, electric-arc furnaces (EAF), blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces with carbon capture and storage (BF/BOF+CCS), 
etc—and a potential lack of green-steel supply. $10 is a tentative value for the BF to 100% scrap EAF + renewable-power lever.

Net-zero steel in construction: The way forwardbuilding. While the decarbonization opportunity 
is large, the cost would be relatively high 
(between approximately $50 and $100 per 
tCO2 abated).

electrify small generators is slightly lower than 
that of heavy equipment or transportation, 
both are approximately $150 to $200 per tCO2, 
representing a substantial cost.

4.  Substitute steel, concrete, and other materials. 
Replacing structural steel with glulam beams 
and cross-laminated timber (CLT)—as well as 
replacing in-situ concrete slabs with CLT or using 
timber instead of concrete for load-bearing walls—
could further reduce building embodied carbon 
emissions.28 The levers in this methodology could 
theoretically abate more than 20 percent of 
embodied carbon emissions, but the cost would 
be relatively high (often around $50 to $100 per 
tCO2—but sometimes significantly more).29 This 
implies a need for market incentives to support 
uptake beyond lighthouse projects.

5.  Promote electrification of on-site equipment. 
On-site emissions from small generators, 
transportation, and heavy equipment could 
be abated through electrification. The 
electrification of small generators seems likely 
in the short term, while the electrification of 
heavy equipment and transportation poses 
challenges associated with battery and 
charging infrastructure. While the cost to 

To put the construction sector on a path to net zero, all 
of the identified levers need to play a role. However, 
given the price sensitivity of the construction industry, 
the cost of several new technologies must be reduced 
to make the proposed changes feasible at scale. 

Next steps: Five key strategies for 
greener steel
To get to net-zero steel and decarbonize the 
construction sector, both public and private actors 
need to support the transition. Here, we gather  
five indispensable strategies that can move the 
agenda forward:

1. Create common definitions for near-zero-
emissions steel and promote transparency
There is no industry alignment on the definition of 
“green steel,” with industry bodies, steel producers, 
and consumers often applying their own definitions 
(see sidebar “Definitions of ‘green steel’ vary”). 
Priorities should include the following:

28 This assumes no regulatory constraints on the use of cross-laminated timber (CLT) or timber (for example, limited to five-story buildings) and 

no recent price increase—for example, CLT or timber could be applied in in-situ concrete slabs, load bearing walls, or facades.

29 For more, see “Call for action,” July 14, 2021.

Definitions of ‘green steel’ vary

Companies have taken varying approach-
es to defining the terms of their transitions. 
Volvo Group announced in 2021 that it 
had signed an agreement to develop the 
world’s first vehicles made of “fossil-free” 
steel, made using fossil-free electricity and 

hydrogen.1 BMW Group said in 2021 that 
it plans to source steel produced with up 
to 95 percent less CO2 emissions without 
requiring fossil resources.2 Steel produc-
er ArcelorMittal said that “recycled and 
renewably produced” means that physical 

steel is made with recycled material (scrap) 
using renewable electricity, leading to a 
CO2 footprint of as low as approximately 
300 kilograms of CO2 per metric ton of  
finished steel when the metallics are 
100 percent scrap.3

Net-zero steel in construction: The way forwardThere is limited visibility into Scope 3 
emissions in the construction value 
chain, which can reduce the appetite for 
investment in near-zero-emissions steel.

 — Seek industry alignment on a common 

 — Develop a uniform methodology to track 

definition along the spectrum of greenness. 
“Green steel” could be defined as having a Scope 
1, 2, and 3 intensity of less than 0.2 tCO2 per 
metric ton of steel. Near-zero-emissions steel 
could be defined as having a Scope 1, 2, and 3 
intensity of less than 0.5 tCO2 per metric ton 
of steel. High-CO2 steel could be defined as 
having a Scope 1, 2, and 3 intensity of more than 
0.5 tCO2 per metric ton of steel. 

emissions of embodied carbon. This would 
require increased traceability of material GHG 
emissions through life cycle assessments 
(LCAs) and environmental product declarations 
(EPDs), and standardized reporting of 
embodied emissions. In effect, this would 
mean expanding and standardizing embodied 
calculators, such as EC3.30

 — Define a measurement system. Develop a 
common CO2 intensity methodology along 
the lines of European standard EN 19694-2, 
specifying how industry participants should 
estimate GHG emissions.

 — Incorporate embodied carbon into standards 
and certifications. Industry entities could 
create requirements for low thresholds of 
embodied carbon emissions in green-building 
rating systems, such as LEED and BREEAM,31 
leveraging EPDs and LCAs.

 — Label near-zero-emissions steel. Create 

common labeling or grading of CO2 intensity 
to support decision making—for example, the 
ResponsibleSteel label.

2. Foster public- and private-sector demand by 
creating visibility into embodied carbon 
There is limited visibility into Scope 3 emissions 
in the construction value chain, which can reduce 
the appetite for investment in near-zero-emissions 
steel. To create visibility, stakeholders should 
consider the following actions:

 — Set embodied-carbon targets. Actors across 
the construction value chain could create 
Scope 3 carbon targets at the portfolio, project, 
and materials levels. They could prioritize 
absolute reductions over intensity reductions 
and align with goals based on Paris Agreement 
1.5° pathways. They could adopt established 
calculation methods—for example, from the 
Science Based Targets initiative.32

 — Translate targets into decision-making 

processes. Owners, financiers, developers,

Net-zero steel in construction: The way forwardMoving the dial on demand

Executives across the construction in-
dustry offer a range of perspectives on the 
challenges ahead:

“If a developer is keen to reduce CO2, they 
will put on pressure and set requirements. 
However, developers have only been 
focused on price.”  
—VP general contractor

“Currently, within the construction industry, 
there has been dialogue about low-CO2 
steel, but there has not been any formal 
request for low-CO2 steel.” 
—Director of commercial, distributor

“Construction will be the second mover. 
When the construction industry starts  
asking the steel industry for low-CO2

products, the steel industry will have  
already reacted to the automotive industry.” 
—VP general contractor

or operators could create templates for 
procurement and reporting in both the 
public and private sectors. In particular, they 
could incorporate internal carbon-pricing 
mechanisms into decision-making processes 
or significant green-steel quotas into 
procurement targets. 

3. Unlock demand for near-zero-emissions steel
Near-zero-emissions steel cannot compete with 
established technologies on the basis of price 
alone (see sidebar “Moving the dial on demand”). To 
unlock demand, developers, operators, owners, and 
large occupiers could prioritize the following:

 — Develop a buyers’ club for near-zero-emissions 

steel. Bring together developers, owners, 
operators, occupiers, and other construction 
value-chain actors willing to buy net-zero (or 
near-net-zero) steel at a premium. These could 
signal demand by aggregating future purchase 
commitments for net-zero steel.

 — Commit to offtake agreements for select 

breakthrough near-zero-emissions steel mills. 
Construction companies or developers that 
procure directly from steel producers could 

guarantee a proportion of the output  
of a “lighthouse” net-zero (or near-net-zero) 
steel mill project for a predetermined period  
of time.

 — Unlock funding for steel mill projects. Large 
developers and owners that buy steel could 
further derisk net-zero (or near-net-zero) steel mill 
projects by assembling willing capital providers or 
becoming equity investors themselves. 

 — Scale and replicate. Scale pilots to potential 
near-zero-emissions buyers, steel producers 
focused on breakthrough technology mills, and 
capital providers willing to invest to reduce the 
green premium (see sidebar “Demand for near-
zero-emissions steel: A hydrogen-reduced DRI/
HBI+EAF mill”).

4. Tilt capital formation toward near-zero-
emissions steel
Most capital providers, including banks, 
infrastructure funds, and pension funds, still do not 
consider embodied carbon in their investment and 
underwriting decisions. To marshal capital toward 
low-emissions steel, they should undertake the 
following actions:

13

Net-zero steel in construction: The way forwardDemand for near-zero-emissions steel: A hydrogen-reduced DRI/HBI+EAF mill

We estimate the capital expenditure 
for a greenfield hydrogen-reduced DRI/
HBI electric-arc furnace (DRI/HBI+EAF) 
mill to be approximately $1.2 billion. The 
illustrative mill would have a 1.2 million 
metric ton capacity, an 85 percent 

utilization rate, and input of 40 percent 
DRI and 60 percent scrap. The example 
assumes that North American prices for 
green hydrogen, including electrolysis, 
drop from $4.89 per kilogram to $1.62 per 
kilogram over 20 years.

For the investment to be as economical 
as BF/BOF production, the steel would 
require a green premium of 20 to 
25 percent over a 20-year period (exhibit).

 — Track and report financed embodied carbon 
emissions. Estimate and publish investment 
and underwriting activities associated with 
emissions, including embodied carbon, while 
using LCAs and EPDs to track embodied 
carbon footprints.

 — Track and report the transition risks associated 
with embodied carbon. Assess exposure to 
embodied carbon emissions from investing or 
underwriting activities—for example, in relation 
to embodied-carbon taxes.

in underwriting and financing activities, using 
references such as an internal carbon price or

 — Tilt funding to near-zero-emissions steel. Create

on near-zero-emissions steel. These might 
include green bonds, transition or emission 
bonds, green loans, or green revolving-credit 
facilities, with interest rates linked to output 
intensity and interest payments pegged to 
green-steel prices.

versus other abatement options?

3.  When and how can I secure a supply of near-zero-
emissions steel? Where do competitors stand?

4.  Which engineering processes and systems need 

to be modified, if any?

5.  How can information about the embodied 

emissions of steel products be best shared 
across the supply chain?

6.  What are the implications for procurement and 

contracting practices?  

5. Disseminate knowledge and awareness
Not all actors in the construction value chain are 
aware of construction embodied carbon footprints, 
the GHG emissions associated with specific 
materials, or the near-term options for addressing 
embodied carbon. Market participants should 
spread the word about carbon footprints, steel 
carbon footprints, and potential decarbonization 
solutions. Platforms such as conferences, training 
sessions, and roundtables would all serve the 
purpose. Discussions should be backed by science-
based assessments of quality and performance, 
case studies, and technical data.

Assuming progress on the five strategies, decision 
makers considering capturing the decarbonization 
opportunity should ask themselves six key questions:

1.  How can I capture the true economic cost 
and value of near-zero-emissions steel in 
construction projects?

The construction industry is at a crossroads. Rising 
demand for new approaches and the emergence 
of viable solutions (albeit at a cost) put the onus 
on companies and stakeholders to accelerate 
the process of greening the industry. Green 
technologies could enable significant reductions 
by 2030 and almost complete abatement by 2050. 
However, progress is contingent on collaboration 
through the value chain, from steel production to 
choices regarding building design, architecture, 
and construction. In our example, a concerted 
effort across a range of levers could reduce 
embodied carbon in a commercial office building 
by more than two-thirds. The imperative, therefore, 
is for the industry to seize the moment, adopt a 
radical mindset, and prepare for the transition to a 
greener future.
