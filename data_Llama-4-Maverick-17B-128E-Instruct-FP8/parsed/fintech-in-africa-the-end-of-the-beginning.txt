Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningExecutive 
summary

Africa’s financial technology (fintech) industry is coming of age. In the face of political and 
economic challenges and a global pandemic, fintech on the continent is booming. Between 2020 
and 2021, the number of tech startups in Africa tripled to around 5,200 companies. Just under 
half of these are fintechs, which are making it their business to disrupt and augment traditional 
financial services.1 McKinsey analysis shows that African fintechs have already made significant 
inroads into the market, with estimated revenues of around $4 billion to 6 billion in 2020 and 
average penetration levels of between 3 and 5 percent (excluding South Africa).2 These figures 
are in line with global market leaders.3

One industry leader we spoke with commented that rather than a “fintech disruption”, the 
continent is experiencing a “fintech eruption”, and local and international investors are taking 
notice. African fintech is emerging as a hotbed for investment, with average deal sizes growing 
and the proportion of fintech funding in Africa increasing over the past year, bringing jobs 
and growth to African economies. And the story is only just beginning. As fintech matures, 
financial services on the continent are at an inflection point, and several African countries 
have a significant opportunity to capitalize on the momentum of recent years to unlock further 
potential in the sector. 

Despite a slow down in funding in line with global trends, we expect significant growth and value 
creation to lie ahead for the fintech industry on the continent. Cash is still used in around  
90 percent of transactions in Africa, which means that fintech revenues have huge potential to 
grow. If the sector overall can reach similar levels of penetration to those seen in Kenya, a country 
with one of the highest levels of fintech penetration in the world, we estimate that African fintech 
revenues could reach eight times their current value by 2025. 

African financial services are undergoing a structural shift 

McKinsey analysis estimates that Africa’s financial services market could grow at about  
10 percent per annum, reaching about $230 billion in revenues by 2025 ($150 billion excluding 
South Africa, which is the largest and most mature market on the continent). Nimble fintech 
players have wasted no time in carving out a share of this expanding market. As the fastest 
growing startup industry in Africa, the success of fintech companies is being fueled by several 
trends, including increasing smartphone ownership, declining internet costs, and expanded 
network coverage, as well as a young, fast-growing, and rapidly urbanizing population.4 The 
COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated existing trends toward digitalization and created a fertile 
environment for new technology players, even as it caused significant hardship and disrupted 
lives and livelihoods across the continent. 

Our analysis shows that fintech players are delivering significant value to their customers. 
Their transactional solutions can be up to 80 percent cheaper and interest on savings up to 
three times higher than those provided by traditional players, while the cost of remittances 
may be up to six times cheaper.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningTaken together with an influx of funding and increasingly supportive regulatory frameworks, 
these factors could signify that African fintech markets are at the beginning of a period of 
exponential growth if, as expected, they follow the trajectory of more mature markets such as 
Vietnam, Indonesia, and India.

However, growth in financial services across Africa’s 54 countries will not be uniform. While 
the lion’s share of value in the market (approximately 40 percent of revenues) is currently 
concentrated in South Africa, which has the most mature banking system on the continent, 
Ghana and francophone West Africa are expected to show the fastest growth, at 15 percent and 
13 percent per annum respectively, until 2025. Nigeria and Egypt follow, each with an expected 
growth rate of 12 percent per annum over the same period. Overall, we anticipate that the growth 
opportunity in fintech is likely to be concentrated in 11 key markets: Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, 
Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda, which 
together account for 70 percent of Africa’s GDP and half of its population.

Given the varying levels of digital maturity across these countries, the opportunities in 
each market will be different. Economies with more mature financial systems and digital 
infrastructure, such as South Africa and Nigeria, are likely to see more innovation in advanced 
financial services, including B2B liquidity and regulatory technology such as anti-money-
laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance. Markets where financial systems 
and infrastructure are still growing, such as Egypt, are likely to see advances in financial services 
such as underwriting, servicing, claims, and assessments in insurance; banking-as-service 
(BaaS) and embedded finance in operations and infrastructure; and buy-now-pay-later services 
in retail and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending. 

With digital becoming a way of life in Africa, the stage is set for the next phase of fintech 
growth. African fintechs and other stakeholders, including governments and investors, have an 
opportunity to consider how the sector can achieve sustainability in the long term. Despite all the 
activity seen on the continent, Africa has only produced a handful of unicorns—startups with a  
$1 billion valuation—and the profitability of many ventures is precarious. This suggests that much 
work remains to create the necessary conditions to unlock the sector’s potential.

Four challenges African fintechs may face in their next stage of growth

The African fintech space is growing exponentially, but the development of the fintech 
ecosystem is still in its early stages. While fintechs have made significant inroads in Africa—
notably in wallets, payments, and distribution—there is still plenty of room for expansion. As the 
market matures, unique white spaces are identifiable in almost all areas of financial services. But 
fintech startups in Africa are facing four key challenges on the road to sustainability: reaching 
scale and profitability, navigating an uncertain regulatory environment, managing scarcity, and 
building robust corporate governance foundations. 

1. Reaching scale and profitability
While the opportunity across the African continent for fintech growth is significant, in certain 
regions the total addressable market (the relevant category of viable customers) is limited by 
infrastructure constraints. These typically include weak mobile and internet penetration in 
some markets, lack of identification coverage, and limited payment rails—the backbone of all 
digital transfers of money. Across Africa, just three countries have real-time payments and the 
necessary payment rail infrastructure in place. 

Fintechs aiming to scale across the continent may need to take this geographic variability 
into account and tailor their approach to each country based on its inherent characteristics, 
infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and varying customer needs and habits. 

Achieving scale is also just one part of a successful growth journey. Lower disposable income 
and lower customer loyalty in Africa make it harder for fintechs to build viable and profitable 
business models through customer monetization, even with a large customer base, and thus 
finding ways to lower customer acquisition cost is vital. Assuming similar investment levels per 
customer, it is almost four times harder to achieve profitability in Africa than it is in Latin America, 
and 13 times harder than it is in the European Union.5

2. Navigating an uncertain regulatory environment
In addition to uneven infrastructure across markets, fintechs in Africa also have to contend 
with a fragmented financial regulatory framework. Different countries are evolving at 
different paces. While regulatory bodies in some countries are starting to support the 
development of an enabling environment—for example, by creating fintech sandboxes, 
updating licensing requirements, and implementing digital KYC regulations—in general, 
complex and variable regulations, including license approval processes, can make it difficult 
for fintechs to ensure business continuity and compliance across markets. 

Fintechs may find that they can’t adapt fast enough in some markets to keep up with 
regulation, which, along with the degree of enforcement, can sometimes change quickly. In 
other markets, fintechs may find they are moving faster than the regulators, which creates a 
whole new set of challenges. Furthermore, entrepreneurs and investors can be exposed to 
fluctuating exchange rates and strict foreign-exchange control in some countries, which make 
it harder to maintain consistency.

3. Managing scarcity
Businesses don’t run on infinite resources. Time, money, and people need to be managed 
effectively to launch and sustain growth. After record-breaking fintech investment in 2021, 
funding is slowing down, especially for later-stage startups, but with incumbents starting to 
catch up with disruptors, fintechs can’t afford to slow down their progress. This suggests that 
African fintechs will likely have to tighten their belts to adjust to a new venture funding reality.6  
Y Combinator (YC), a US-based technology startup accelerator, has advised its community 
of over 7,000 founders to expect and plan for the worst, cut costs, and extend their runway

6  Kevin Kelleher, “Unicorns are finding it harder to run with the pack as valuations tumble,” Fortune, May 9 2022.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningbecause “during economic downturns even top-tier VC funds slow down their deployment of 
capital. This causes less competition between funds for deals which results in lower valuations, 
lower round sizes, and many fewer deals completed”.7 As a result, it may be necessary to find 
ways to boost local participation in venture financing. Currently, about 70 percent of fintech 
start-up deals are financed by investors headquartered outside of Africa, most of them in North 
America. Additionally, most locally financed deals are for early-stage startups.

Successful fintechs will likely need an ambitious strategy to attract, develop, and retain 
the very best talent. According to some estimates, about 50 percent of Africa’s software 
developers are based in just five countries (South Africa, Nigeria, Morocco, Kenya, and Egypt).8 
What’s more, this concentrated pool of talent is in demand not just in Africa, but globally. The 
World Bank estimates that there is a significant brain drain of ICT professionals from low- and 
middle-income countries every year as they seek better employment opportunities and higher 
wages in countries where the digital sector is more developed.9 Successful fintechs will need 
to navigate these twin challenges of scarcer capital and increasing competition for talent to 
thrive going forward.

4. Building robust corporate governance foundations
Ensuring world-class corporate governance is likely to be a critical factor in enabling fintechs 
to navigate this uncertain and fragmented terrain, manage scarcity, and successfully reach 
scale and profitability. An effective governance structure can help to build a strong, positive 
organizational culture that provides stability, clarity, and direction—even in difficult times.

There are three broad characteristics of a healthy corporate governance model: strong 
culture building, productive stakeholder engagement, and a clear talent strategy to build the 
organization’s capabilities. While matching a fintech’s value proposition to the right market may 
be a critical first step in building a successful startup, to maintain momentum it is necessary  
to define routines, norms, and processes that are shared and understood by everyone in the 
organization. In today’s world of hybrid working, this is even more critical than before. And 
because fintechs can evolve rapidly, it is vital that they have a well-developed compliance 
foundation to actively manage regulatory change and avoid falling foul of regulators—a challenge 
many are starting to face. 

While matching a fintech’s value proposition 
to the right market may be a critical first step 
in building a successful startup, to maintain 
momentum it is necessary to define routines, 
norms, and processes that are shared and 
understood by everyone in the organization.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningAfrica’s leading fintechs share a set of winning characteristics

Fintechs operating in Africa will know that there are no quick wins on the continent. In 
overcoming the common obstacles in their path, our analysis shows that the most successful 
African tech startups share six characteristics with features that mirror those of successful 
global companies, and have also adapted their business models to the unique economic realities 
and customer needs of Africa.

First, given the variability between African markets, it is important that fintechs match their 
value proposition to the market they are entering. Globally, we have seen fintechs evolving to 
achieve scale through three major routes. Some start out as a distributor of unique non-financial 
consumer products and evolve into a fintech, while others start with a specific financial B2C or 
B2B product and evolve into a digital bank. A third option is to start with a payment infrastructure 
solution and evolve into a national digital platform. In Africa, infrastructure constraints have 
meant that the continent’s oldest fintechs—for example, Fawry in Egypt, M-Pesa in Kenya, and 
Interswitch in Nigeria—entered markets by building infrastructure specific to a single country 
and are now the market leaders as a result.  

Second, to achieve sustainable growth, companies that have a long history of operating on 
the continent have built their success on rapid customer acquisition. Africa’s fast-growing 
population of more than 1.3 billion people offers a large potential market for fintechs, but actually 
acquiring customers can be challenging because of factors such as infrastructure constraints 
and low customer purchasing power. Leading players have had to take steps to overcome 
such constraints by, for example, leveraging pre-existing physical networks or by employing 
aggressive pricing strategies to offer cheaper fees and charges than competitors.  

8

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningThird, once having acquired customers, leading fintechs have found a sustainable way to translate 
this into clear monetization strategies. Such strategies have one of two things in common: they 
either have a repeatable and healthy revenue source coming from core activities, such as card 
switching for Interswitch or serving merchants with point-of-sale (POS) for Yoco, or they have 
multiple monetization strategies, such as having a B2C arm for a B2B company or vice versa. For 
example, M-Pesa and MTN both have a strong lending component in addition to their wallets 
while Paga has leveraged its strong position in wallets to expand into merchant acquiring.  

Fourth, a key marker of success in Africa has been the ability to adapt to the reality of low average 
revenue per user (ARPU), both in the consumer and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises 
sectors. GDP per capita in Africa is the lowest of any continent and fintechs have adjusted to this 
by, for example, using scale to reduce the cost of serving customers, as M-Pesa has done, or 
changing the business model to pay-as-you-go to service businesses that can’t afford advance 
payments, as Yoco has done. 

Fifth, another African reality is that, with 90 percent of all transactions on the continent still cash 
based, successful fintechs have had to find ways to reach clients offline. Key strategies here have 
included building agent networks or using pre-existing infrastructure such as physical shops for 
delivery of financial services. For example, South Africa’s first digital bank, TymeBank, overcame 
infrastructure challenges through a strategic alliance with major retailers. This has enabled the 
bank to place account-opening kiosks in retail stores across the country, bypassing the need for 
a physical branch network.10

Finally, with regulators increasingly active in Africa, fintechs are required to pay attention to and 
comply with regulation. Many successful fintechs including OPay, M-Pesa, and Fawry have, after 
reaching significant scale, chosen to proactively engage with regulatory stakeholders so that 
they are able to move forward together. 

The most successful African tech startups 
share six characteristics with features that 
mirror those of successful global companies, 
and have also adapted their business models 
to the unique economic realities and customer 
needs of Africa.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningUnlocking the potential of fintech in Africa

All the signs point to the culmination of African fintech’s first phase of development. Fintechs 
have become major players in the African financial services sector (in some instances rivaling 
traditional banks in terms of size and value), funding has increased, and value is being generated. 
In fact, the number of high-valued fintechs is increasing exponentially. Additionally, consumer 
access is at an all-time high. 

A growing fintech industry has the potential to create jobs, skills, opportunities, and wealth 
across the continent. An IFC study estimates that over 230 million jobs in sub-Saharan Africa will 
require digital skills by 2030, creating opportunities in adjacent industries too, notably training.11 
The fintech eruption in Africa is seeding an ecosystem that could bring a number of social 
benefits as well by, for example, improving access to healthcare and insurance at scale and 
increasing access to lending in key sectors such as agriculture. The newcomers are also proving 
instrumental in driving financial inclusion, particularly among women. 

To scale up these benefits, stakeholders, including governments, investors, the traditional 
financial services sector, and fintechs, have a critical role to play in creating the conditions for 
sustainable growth and in supporting innovation.

Regulators, for instance, could consider taking steps to formalize data systems, promote 
predictable regulation, and keep pace with changes in the fintech landscape, while investors 
could look to expand local opportunities, educate African investors on potential opportunities 
on the continent, and focus on the tangible value added by startups rather than just on their 
sale valuation. As Jumanne Mtambalike, CEO of investment firm Sahara Ventures commented: 
“Whether we call them ‘Zebracons’ or ‘Camels’ we need to find a way to make African startups 
look more like African businesses and not vehicles created to be sold to the highest bidders in 
the private investor and stock markets.” 12 

Fintechs and incumbents could focus on building talent and training for the future as well as 
looking to build partnerships—with each other and with regulators—to build out the ecosystems 
necessary to support fintech growth alongside national development priorities.

Today’s leaders have built the payment rails, effectively laying the foundations upon which 
the industry can grow, but tightening market conditions suggest that in their next phase of 
development, fintechs may need to adapt their focus as they look to consolidate and formalize 
to achieve enduring success. But if stakeholders can work together to build on the momentum 
gained in recent years, the prospects for African fintech are strong; and the next marvel of 
African unicorns is ready to emerge.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginning1. Laying down 
the path

All signs are pointing to the maturation of Africa’s fintech sector. For decades, Africa’s 
inclusion in the world of traditional finance has been limited, with many countries suffering 
from a lack of access to banking, insurance, and credit services. As a result, cash is still king 
on the continent, with only about 10 percent of transactions made digitally.13 

However, a clear structural shift is now underway. Unprecedented growth in the fintech 
sector—boosted by technology advances, lower data costs, and improved regulatory 
frameworks—is changing the way people bank, shop, do business, and live on the continent. 

These shifts have the potential to drive both social and economic gains. Our analysis points to 
the likelihood that if the sector overall can reach similar levels of penetration as seen in Kenya, 
a country with one of the highest levels of fintech penetration in the world, fintech revenues 
could reach eight times their current value by 2025 (Exhibit 1).

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningFintech innovation is delivering an all-access pass to financial services  

Fintech is the fastest growing startup industry in Africa, garnering 54 percent of known 
startup funding in 2021, according to Africa: The Big Deal—a database listing all funding 
deals of $100,000 and more secured by startups in Africa. Agile technology startups are 
innovating to meet the needs of large and diverse markets. Africa’s total GDP is approximately 
$2.4 trillion, and its population around 1.3 billion, yet around 65 percent of Africans remain 
unbanked or underbanked. 14  

As a result, the adoption of payment solutions, notably digital wallets, has been growing 
steadily across various African markets for several years. This trend appears to have 
accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic as physical distancing measures encouraged 
consumers to move away from cash and led merchants to prioritize acceptance of new 
payment tools.15 Across the continent, platforms like Piggyvest and Cowrywise are giving 
millions of customers—up to 70 percent of whom are first-time savers—access to savings 
vehicles, often with cheaper fees and charges than traditional banks are able to offer, while 
innovative lending products like Fuliza, a digital mobile overdraft facility, enable access 
to credit relief for those left out of the formal banking sector. These new platforms have 
addressed a finance gap of more than $400 million to date.16

McKinsey analysis reveals that new technology-based solutions for everyday requirements 
such as buying airtime, transferring funds, and paying bills are now available to lower-income 
households for up to 80 percent less than these services would cost with traditional banking 
players. Fintechs also offer customers greater convenience and value; for example, interest rates 
on savings could be up to three times higher than those provided by traditional banks in some 
markets, while the cost of remittances may be up to six times cheaper.

Our analysis shows that fintech disruptors are actively developing innovative financial products 
in eight out of nine product areas.17 Novel solutions in wallets, accounts, payments, remittances, 
wealth management, insurance, and lending that are tailored to meet the unique needs of 
customers on the African continent are rapidly gaining ground and challenging incumbents. 

For instance, digital wallets that combine a no-frills bank account with a payment gateway 
preclude the need for a traditional transactional account, allowing customers to load virtual 
money they can use to make payments. Businesses like EcoCash and Mukuru not only provide 
their customers with remittances at reduced rates, but also facilitate near-instant transactions, 
overcoming customers’ dependency on informal remittance systems that may lack security, 
require physical agents, and can take up to several weeks to fulfil.  

Along with the convenience they offer, fintechs also create jobs, develop talent in 
specialized areas such as software development, increase access to lending in key 
economic sectors such as agriculture, and provide access to healthcare and health services 
through micro-insurance (Exhibit 2).

Additionally, the fintech industry is playing a vital role in enabling financial inclusion across 
gender lines. Research has shown that in Niger, women who received government subsidies 
through mobile money instead of cash have greater power in household decision-making, while 
in Kenya, women-led households that adopted mobile money saw an increase in household 
savings.18 Direct cash transfer programs have also proven a valuable way to reach vulnerable 
households during times of crisis. For example, in Togo, the government’s Novissi platform 
delivered contactless emergency support to households in the greater Lomé area during a 
COVID-19 lockdown, and registered more than 300,000 beneficiaries in just one week.19 

By innovating with products that meet the needs of people across cultures, genders, technology, 
and geography, fintech is helping to reframe African financial services, creating new opportunities 
for populations as well as for investors. This could be a game changer for the continent. 

Eleven countries are currently at the heart of the fintech opportunity 
in Africa

McKinsey analysis of multiple data sources shows that, as of 2020, the financial services market 
in Africa that is addressable by fintech companies—including both fintech and formal banking—
was worth $150 billion. These revenues were primarily driven by insurance and retail and SME 
lending, which made up about 60 percent of total revenues. This market is likely to grow by 10 
percent per year to reach approximately $230 billion by 2025. Within this, excluding blockchain 
and crypto, payments and wallets are likely to grow fastest, both at around 20 percent CAGR 
from 2020-2025 (Exhibit 3).

Overall, we anticipate that, as fintech accelerates on the African continent, 11 key countries are 
likely to be at the center of the market’s evolution. These countries, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, 
Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda, together 
account for 70 percent of Africa’s GDP and half of the population of the continent. 21 They also 
offer fintechs and investors a favorable environment, including increased digital readiness and 
higher mobile and internet penetration. Mobile penetration is more than 100 percent in most of 
these opportunity markets, with Nigeria and Ghana seeing the highest growth in smartphone 
usage in the world, but internet penetration lags behind, at below 50 percent in most markets.22 

Digital penetration is likely to increase steadily as historical barriers to mobile and internet on the 
continent continue to be dismantled. Data costs fell by around 15 percent per annum between 
2015 and 2019, while fixed broadband subscribers per 100 people grew by around 11 percent in the 
same time period.23 Between 2010 and 2019, over 300 million people in Africa came online for the 
first time, with the continent showing the highest growth in internet use, mobile-cellular telephone 
subscriptions, international bandwidth, and 3G (or better) mobile coverage globally.24 The COVID-19 
pandemic has accelerated these shifts, and by 2025, the International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU) anticipates that the number of smartphone connections in the region will more than double.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningKey trends driving digital expansion in Africa

Globally, increased availability of data and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been 
among the major factors that have driven structural change in the financial services market, 
alongside technological advancements, the globalization of consumer demands, favorable 
regulation, and infrastructure voids stimulating innovation. In Africa, a similar pattern is unfolding, 
although the shift is also being driven by uniquely African trends (Exhibit 4). For example, 
African governments and financial institutions are taking action through policies and product 
development to broaden financial inclusion for populations still largely reliant on cash. This 
presents fintechs with a significant opportunity to migrate Africa’s sizeable population of cash-
based customers to new solutions. 

Exhibit 4

Seven trends are helping accelerate the growth of fintech in Africa.

Key characteristics and descriptions

1. Push for financial inclusion

Governments and financial institutions are taking action to cater to the financially excluded through policies and the development of 
innovative products and solutions. 

Regulators are taking steps to level the playing fields for fintech innovation and build an enabling fintech ecosystem.

2. Dethroning cash

With less than 10% of transactions made via electronic payment, Africa has the largest opportunity globally to migrate from cash.

3. Increased availability of funding for innovation

Capital is becoming more readily available as investors take notice of and support rapid innovation of African fintech companies. 
Despite a drop off in global funding in 2022, African fintechs raised the same amount of funding in the first 5 months of 2022 as they did 
during the whole of 2021.

4. Fast growth in spending

African private consumption expenditure (PCE) was growing at 4.8% before the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is expected to continue 
growing at 4.8% CAGR to 2025. 

5. Young, fast-growing, and urbanizing population

Africa has the world’s highest population growth rate at 2.7% as well as the youngest median age (20), and more than 1bn people are 
expected to live in urbanized areas by 2045.

6. Increasing digital penetration

Digital penetration in Africa has accelerated faster than other regions. Over 300 million people in Africa gained access to the internet 
between 2010 and 2019 and the barriers to connectivity are constantly shrinking (eg high data prices, high device prices, low fixed 
broadband penetration, slow internet speeds).

7. COVID-19 acceleration

COVID-19 has positively accelerated digitalization trends.

fintech a big winner", CIO, February 6, 2022; Joanna Glasner, "Here’s What’s Driving Latin America’s Rank As The World’s Fastest-Growing Region 
For Venture Funding", Crunchbase News, January 21, 2022

Other unique features driving Africa’s structural shift include rapid population growth and 
urbanization. Africa’s population is growing faster than any other region in the world, at a rate 
of 2.7 percent, more than double that of both India (1 percent) and China (0.4 percent), and the 
median age on the continent is just 20 years old. 25 To put this in context, India’s median age is 28, 
and that of China and Europe is 37. Our World in Data reports that, based on the UN’s medium 
growth scenario, Africa’s share of world population will rise from 17 percent (1.3 billion) today to 
40 percent (4.3 billion) by 2100.26

As the continent’s population grows, so too does urbanization, and by 2045 it is estimated that 
more than 1 billion people in Africa will live in urbanized areas.27 At the same time, the amount 
of money individuals spend on goods and services will also increase. And while personal 
consumption expenditure (PCE) in Africa is currently low, at $1,505 per capita harmonized 
(compared to $5,433 in Latin America and $49,423 in North America), it is forecast to grow 
steadily at 4.8 percent CAGR between 2020–2025.28

This new generation of young, urbanized African consumers represents a large market of 
digitally-savvy individuals who have grown up in a time when digital technologies are flourishing. 
They provide a fast-growing customer base that is primed to adopt digital solutions to meet their 
financial needs. 

Given these favorable tailwinds, the continent has become an attractive opportunity for 
foreign investors, and this is adding further fuel to the industry. Startup funding in Africa is 
growing faster than any other market, increasing by over 200 percent between 2020 and 2021 
(compared to 90 percent globally) (Exhibit 5). Notwithstanding a drop in venture capital funding 
in 2020 due to COVID-19, African technology startup funding grew by more than 18 times over 
the last six years—twice the speed at which total start-up funding globally grew in the last year.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningMore than 45 percent of this is attributed to fintechs, which have enjoyed exponential growth  
in funding for three years in a row. Funding of African-based startups also grew across all  
levels of funding type. While Series A–D funding made up the majority, at around $2.2 billion 
between 2019 and 2021, venture and seed funding also rose, making up almost 25 percent of 
total funding.29  

In 2021, ten companies, most of them located in South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, and Kenya, raised 
more than $1.6 billion from investors. Of these, four have achieved ‘unicorn’ status, the term 
given to startups valued at $1 billion or more: OPay, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and Wave.30 And 
despite a sharp drop off in global funding in recent months, African fintechs have raised the same 
amount during the first five months of 2022 as they did during the whole of 2021.31

Shifting regulation is also playing its part in supporting and sustaining fintech growth on the 
continent, with many African regulators taking steps to level the playing fields for fintech 
innovation and build an enabling fintech ecosystem to facilitate innovation. Several countries 
have introduced detailed data protection guidelines in the last three years to create clarity for 
new entrants, offset future regulatory risk, and set up regulatory sandboxes as a way to stimulate 
risk-free innovation in the fintech space. For instance, Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda have set 
up programs to stimulate financial inclusion and reduce physical cash transactions, and others 
are taking steps to drive digital adoption with innovations. The JSE in South Africa is issuing 
debentures—a medium- to long-term debt instrument used by large companies to borrow money 
at a fixed rate of interest—under a digital ledger, while Ghana and Nigeria are implementing 
proposed central bank digital currencies (the e-Cedi and e-Naira).

In addition, positive regulatory policy agreements, notably the African Continental Free Trade 
Area (AfCFTA), which will create the largest free trade area in the world, and the planned roll out 
of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) may open new avenues of growth 
for fintechs by increasing cross-border payments and trade. Fintechs are well-positioned to 
provide digital solutions that solve cross-border payment challenges and lay the groundwork for 
migrating the continent away from cash to digital transaction platforms.

Taken together, these trends in digital transformation have placed African markets at the 
beginning of an exponential growth trajectory if, as expected, they follow the path of mature 
markets like Vietnam, Indonesia, and India, who are ahead of them on the curve. 

African fintech is primed to expand into more advanced financial services

Although fintechs have made significant inroads in Africa—notably in wallets, payments, and 
distribution—there is plenty of room for expansion. As the market matures, unique white spaces 
are identifiable in almost all areas of financial services (Exhibit 6). Given the inherent variability in 
markets across the continent, opportunities will differ across each, with advanced economies such 
as South Africa and Nigeria seeing more white space in advanced financial such as B2B liquidity 
and regulatory technology such as anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) 
compliance. Burgeoning fintech markets such as Egypt are likely to see more innovation in financial 
services such as underwriting and servicing claims and assessments in the insurance vertical; 
banking-as-a-service (BaaS) and embedded finance in operations and infrastructure; and buy-
now-pay-later services in retail and SME lending.

Globally, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are still in the early stages of adoption, 
but they are also growing fast. In fact, Africa was the fastest growing cryptocurrency market 
in the world, with an increase of 1,200 percent between July 2020 and June 2021, with Kenya, 
Nigeria, and South Africa among the top ten countries in the world in terms of cryptocurrency 
adoption.32 Yet, when looked at in terms of the overall value of trades in the same period, 
the continent lags significantly behind the rest of the world.33 Given the apparent interest 
in this area, combined with the preponderance of mobile devices and an underdeveloped 
financial infrastructure, the opportunity for using blockchain to enable foreign exchange and 
remittance payments could be strong.

The stage is set for growth, but questions remain

The opportunity for fintech growth in Africa is there, with pockets of excellence cropping up 
across multiple regions. However, questions around profitability and sustainable value are 
not yet fully resolved. Despite the funding boom for fintechs in Africa, the continent is trailing 
other regions in terms of the number of unicorns it is producing relative to funding received. 
Our analysis indicates that Asia (excluding China) has produced 138 unicorns, while Africa 
has produced just ten (including embedded telco fintechs).34 When measuring the number of 
unicorns against population, Brazil leads with 84 per billion people. Latin America, excluding 
Brazil, produced 54 unicorns per billion people and South-East Asia 49 unicorns per billion 
people. In contrast, Africa has produced only eight defined unicorns for every billion people on 
the continent.   

However, Africa is gaining ground on Latin America and South-East Asia, both of which are a 
couple of years ahead of Africa in terms of fintech evolution. In 2021, our analysis found that 
African fintech startups were able to raise funding equal to that raised by both regions between 
2019 and 2021, with the number of deals in Africa growing at a more rapid rate than that seen in 
the other two regions.35 

African fintech revenues are between $4.5 billion and $6 billion, compared to financial services 
market revenues of $150 billion, with penetration below that of developed countries (2 to 
3 percent compared to 3 to 5 percent globally). However, as fintech disruption is primarily

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningconcentrated outside of South Africa, when excluding this country from the mix, fintech 
penetration in Africa is in line with global markets. And in leading markets like Kenya and Ghana it 
is up to double that of global benchmarks (Exhibit 7). 

These signs point to the culmination of African fintech’s first phase of development (Exhibit 8). 
Fintechs have become major players in the African financial services sector (in some instances 
rivaling traditional banks in terms of size and value), funding has increased, and value is being 
generated. In fact, the number of high-valued fintechs is increasing exponentially. Additionally, 
consumer access is at an all-time high. Today’s leaders have built the payment rails, effectively 
laying the foundations upon which the industry can grow, but tightening market conditions 
suggest that in their next phase of development, fintechs may need to adapt their focus as they 
look to consolidate and formalize to achieve enduring success.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginning2. All things 
excellent are 
as difficult as 
they are rare

It is already evident that African fintechs are facing some challenges in their ability to scale and 
grow, with some having to re-imagine their target audiences or adapt and change to alternative 
revenue streams as their new primary source of income. Many fintechs are also struggling to 
monetize their customer base as, having used low pricing or free services to attract customers, 
they are discovering that their revenue repeatability is limited. 

At a corporate governance level, ongoing investigations around fintechs’ working cultures 
are clouding the horizon, and it is becoming a concern that fintechs appear to have limited 
capabilities to manage risk frameworks around multiple regions.

Our analysis of the African landscape highlights four hurdles that fintechs are likely to face in the 
next phase of their development:

1.  Reaching scale and profitability, locally and further afield, with current infrastructure and 

market constraints.

2.  Navigating an uncertain and complex regulatory environment and currency controls across 

different markets.

3.  Building robust corporate governance foundations to ensure sustainable growth as each 

business matures.

4.  Managing scarcity through securing and retaining the right talent and funding through the 

development cycle.

How businesses, policymakers, and investors navigate these four areas will determine the extent 
to which the potential in the fintech space is realized.

Reaching scale and profitability

Success in any given environment largely depends on how an entity adapts to its unique 
characteristics, and in Africa, which consists of multiple playing fields, this is by no means 
straightforward. While there may appear to be significant opportunities for fintechs across 
the African continent, in certain regions the total addressable market (the relevant category 
of viable customers) is limited by infrastructure and market constraints. For example, in Côte 
d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Tanzania, Uganda, and Nigeria, more than 40 percent of the population 
are technically unregistered, without formal identification.36 

36   Vyjayanti Desai, Anna Diofasi, Jing Lu, “The global identification challenge: Who are the 1 billion people without proof of 

identity?”, World Bank Blogs, April 25, 2018.

23

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningOn top of this, internet penetration in these countries was below 50 percent in 2020 and 
payment rails are limited; across the 11 priority markets we’ve identified in Africa, just three 
(Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria) have a real-time payments system and the payment infrastructure 
necessary to enable rapid scale-up of fintech services. Aminata Kane, OMEA executive and 
board member and former CEO of Orange Sierra Leone, comments: “Despite recent growth in 
internet connectivity in Africa, data penetration is still low, around 50 percent on average; only 
half of the population can download an application. If you don’t think of USSD (Unstructured 
Supplementary Service Data) as a channel, you might be cutting off half of the cake.” 37 

A further challenge confronting fintech startups is that, in certain markets, incumbents 
and telcos generate the majority of fintech revenues. In Kenya, Safaricom alone generates 
almost 100 percent of mobile money consumer revenues.38 Telcos are already generating 
significant revenues from their fintech operations in Africa thanks to the fact that mobile 
phone penetration far exceeds access to banks. Telcos also benefit from having both low-
cost operating models and a wealth of customer data, which they can use to assess risk when 
approving loans or offering other services—a decided advantage on a continent where most 
markets lack credit bureaus.39

39   Nqobile Dudla et al. “Pandemic spurs Africa’s mobile telcos to ramp up banking bid,” Reuters, September 29, 2020.

24

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningThis gives fintechs limited bargaining power. The situation has led one fintech entrepreneur in 
Morocco to comment: “In bank-led countries, building partnerships with incumbents is critical for 
success. Go-to-market is faster than if you had to build your own systems. You can benefit from 
their tech infrastructure, and it reassures the regulator.”

This discrepancy between regions in Africa highlights the importance of tailoring different 
approaches to different regions depending on their inherent characteristics. We have 
identified four broad market clusters across the 11 key markets identified, each with a discrete 
pathway and requiring a bespoke approach (Exhibit 9). Fintechs in South Africa and Morocco, 
which have relatively mature traditional banking systems but relatively low mobile payment 
penetration, can look for opportunities in specific areas, notably B2B. Fintechs in mobile-
money specialist markets like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Ghana, that are characterized by 
high penetration of mobile money services and an enthusiastic adoption of products such as 
payments and digital wallets, are likely to prosper by offering innovative solutions rather than 
formal financial services. 40  

Nigeria and Egypt, meanwhile, are disruption-ready markets. In Egypt, for example, a sizeable 
chunk of the population remains unbanked, and existing banking processes tend to be slow, 
with loan approvals often requiring days and multiple face-to-face engagements.41 In such 
markets, fintechs that offer streamlined onboarding and digital processes are well placed to take 
advantage and disrupt the financial services status quo, increasing penetration and services. 

Côte d’Ivoire, Cameroon, and Senegal, where mobile money is still in the early stages of 
development and usage, are characterized by a high proportion of cash transactions, usually 
involving an agent. As such, they represent an opportunity for fintechs with cheaper, faster, and 
more convenient financial service options. However, investors that move into these markets will 
need deep local knowledge to understand how to drive customer adoption. 

In Côte d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Tanzania, Uganda, 
and Nigeria, more than 40 percent of the 
population are technically unregistered, without 
formal identification. On top of this, internet 
penetration in these countries was below 50 
percent in 2020 and payment rails are limited.

4. Banking penetration, 2020 %; 5. Banking concentration, 2020 % assets; 6. Mobile money transactions as a % of GDP, 2020; 7. Ease of doing 
business, 2019; 8. Instant payment banking system.

Achieving scale is also just one part of a successful growth journey. A large customer base 
provides potential, but unless those numbers translate into meaningful monetization, this 
potential will remain untapped. Lower disposable income and lower customer loyalty in 
Africa—given that fintechs typically use a “freemium” model to attract customers—makes it 
harder for fintechs to build viable business models through customer monetization. 

In this environment, finding ways to reduce customer acquisition costs is vital. Assuming 
similar investment levels per customer, it is almost four times harder to achieve customer 
monetization in Africa than it is in Latin America, and 13 times harder than it is in the 
European Union.42 Yemi Lalude, Partner and Head of Africa TPG Growth Investment, sums 
up these challenges: “Spending a ton of money to acquire customers is a fool’s errand—there 
is virtually no customer loyalty. Most people in Africa have more time than money—there is no 
inertia that will stop people from changing to a cheaper product.”43

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningNavigating a complex regulatory environment

While some African countries are taking steps to create more enabling environments for the 
development of fintechs, an unharmonized regulatory framework—meaning that legislative 
rules and guidelines are fragmented across different regions, increasing the risk of exposure to 
exchange rate fluctuation and strict foreign exchange controls—could impact the speed with 
which individual companies can grow across geographies. 

Regulatory bodies have a complex role to play in protecting the rights of consumers and creating 
a supportive environment in which business can thrive and grow. As things stand, the 11 key 
countries identified in this report are at different stages in their journey towards strengthening 
the environment to help ensure that fintechs can provide their services to customers and 
businesses (Exhibit 10). For example, in Egypt and Tanzania, the operations and infrastructure for 
open banking to enable secure interoperability in the banking industry are still being defined, but 
for other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco, Nigeria, and Ghana, this space is either not 
regulated or restricted. Cryptocurrency wealth management is only defined and allowed in South 
Africa and Uganda, while Morocco, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania do not allow cryptocurrency 
wealth management. In Ghana cryptocurrency is unregulated and in Egypt it is restricted. And 
while most countries allow digital authentication regulations, in Egypt and Morocco these are still 
being developed.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningWith such variability in regulatory progress and differences in approach, running a fintech 
company across diverse geographical areas can be difficult. As Dare Okoudjou, founder and 
CEO at MSF Africa told us, “in scaling across markets, the difficulty compounds.” 44

Ultimately, the uncertain regulatory framework suggests an imbalance between how a business 
needs to operate and the most efficient means by which it can operate and creates a number of 
compliance challenges for fintechs across Africa. 

This imbalance may be caused by the fast pace of digital innovation led by fintechs outpacing any 
reasonable timeframe for regulatory evolution. In some cases, however, regulators may act with 
speed, changing legislation that impacts a business’s operating environment, leaving little time 
for fintechs to adapt. Fintechs may have to pivot depending on the evolution of the regulatory 
framework, and may potentially have to dedicate entire teams to engaging with regulators to 
ensure compliance. 

Perhaps the most pointed regulatory challenge facing fintechs is the issue of licensing, which 
determines whether a business can operate within a given jurisdiction. The harmonization and 
streamlining of licensing requirements, potentially across borders, could go a long way toward 
enhancing the speed and scale of fintech growth. 

Fintechs wanting to expand regionally also risk exposure to volatile exchange rates and 
restrictive exchange controls. From a startup perspective, currency volatility exposes African 
entrepreneurs to the exchange rate risks of converting sales in other countries to local 
currencies and delivering on debt obligations denominated by US dollars, making it more 
expensive to operate using local currencies. Additionally, strict foreign exchange controls 
enforced by many African central banks to restrict the transfer of cash out of a country, can mean 
that hedging strategies—that balance these risks through cash management—are limited. 

While currency stability is not exclusively an African problem, these risks disproportionately 
impact entrepreneurs and businesses on the continent from an operational perspective and 
affect their ability to attract investment. Private equity and venture capital investors often 
carry significant currency risks. Balancing multi-year investment horizons and illiquid assets 
makes managing risk exposure a delicate process. 

The harmonization and streamlining of 
licensing requirements, potentially across 
borders, could go a long way toward enhancing 
the speed and scale of fintech growth.

Managing scarcity

Businesses don’t run on infinite resources. Time, money, and people need to be managed 
effectively to launch and sustain growth. Finding the right talent and securing enough funding 
for ongoing development in the face of intense competition, including from incumbents, is a 
challenging path to have to walk.

Despite recent gains, Africa still lags behind the rest of the world when it comes to attracting 
sufficient investment to finance scale-up growth. And despite recent successful exit stories, 
African startups are still perceived as illiquid assets compared to other markets due to limited 
exit opportunities. While there were more than 126 initial public offerings (IPOs) on the London 
Stock Exchange in 2021 and more than 55 in Latin America, there were only eight in the whole of 
Africa in the same period.45

At the same time, there is evidence that the funding boom of the past year is drying up, putting 
further pressure on fintechs to do more with less. Y Combinator (YC), a US-based technology 
startup accelerator, has advised its community of over 7,000 founders to expect and plan for the 
worst, cut costs, and extend their runway because “during economic downturns, even top tier 
VC funds slow down their deployment of capital. This causes less competition between funds for 
deals which results in lower valuations, lower round sizes, and many fewer deals completed”.46 
African fintech companies are more vulnerable to global funding fluctuations largely because the 
local investor market is comparatively weak. Approximately 70 percent of fintech startup deals 
are financed by investors headquartered outside of Africa, most of them originating from North 
America (39 percent).47 This means fintech founders not only need to know their businesses 
inside out, but also need to understand the venture capital ecosystem abroad, and know which 
investors are focused on Africa and have a special interest in financial technology companies. 

Fintech companies could position themselves optimally to attract funding throughout the 
funding cycle by targeting specific investors depending on the relevant investment stage. Seed 
funding rounds—usually smaller, riskier investments—can be raised locally, as African investors 
represent more than 36 percent of seed investment rounds. Later-stage funding to scale up 
effectively after demonstrating proven growth will likely be more easily raised internationally. 
Only 10 percent of series C and D rounds between 2019 and 2022 were raised with Africa-based 
investors (Exhibit 11). 

The promising news is that Africa proportionately receives more funding for female-led 
businesses than the United States and Europe combined. Despite this, however, and although 
the trend is improving—the proportion of total funding raised by female CEOs in Africa climbed 
from 2.4 percent in 2020 to 6.5 percent in 2021—there remains a major capital allocation gap 
between men and women.48

As African fintechs work to tighten their belts in the face of a slower funding environment, 
making sure they are able to attract and retain the best talent will add additional cost pressures, 
but could become a key differentiator. The Allianz Risk Barometer 2022 ranks a shortage of 
skilled talent as one of the top ten risks facing business around the world. And in Africa, this 
challenge is exacerbated because 50 percent of Africa’s software developers are based in just 
five countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Morocco, Kenya, and Egypt.49 This concentration of talent 
could translate into significant potential for emerging fintech players in those countries. But it is 
also a risk. In a global world, each of these countries is not just competing with its neighbors for 
talent, but is competing with the rest of the world. 

Additionally, although Africa holds nearly 17 percent of the global population, the continent’s 
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) capabilities lag behind the rest of 
the world.50 Of those who do graduate with STEM capabilities, many are seeking opportunities 
abroad. The World Bank reports that a mismatch between supply and demand for ICT 
professionals in low- and middle-income economies prompts outward migration toward better 
employment opportunities in countries where the digital sector is more developed. Even where 
skilled data workers have opportunities in low- and middle-income countries, wage differentials 
could be a driver of migration.51 Data from the International Labour Organization ILOSTAT 
Database show that low- and middle-income countries experienced a net outflow of talent 
of around 70,000 workers every year from 2015 to 2019. This has prompted Junaid Dadan, 
Co-founder and CPO at Stitch—an African API infrastructure company—to comment, “Africa has 
lots of talent, but they are very underpaid. You need to be willing to pay your talent properly.” 52

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningBuilding robust corporate governance foundations

As a fintech business matures, a critical contributor to ongoing success and sustainability is 
to have a world-class corporate governance structure in place to help build a strong, positive 
organizational culture that provides stability, clarity, and direction even in difficult times.

There are three broad constitutive parts to a healthy corporate governance model: strong culture 
and capability building, productive stakeholder engagement, and a clear human resources and 
talent strategy (Exhibit 12).

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningWhile product-market fit is important to establish and grounds a successful start-up, a business 
culture that builds organizational capability is what keeps the fire burning. A strong, positive 
culture can help enable rapid growth in line with a manageable and sustainable scale-up. 
Management may want to act as a role model for the entrepreneurial attitude it expects from 
talent, and to ensure that everyone is committed to the company’s clearly defined culture. 
This may be especially important within the modern context of hybrid working, where defined 
routines and norms are important to provide ethical and operational guidelines. A robust talent 
strategy and clear HR processes are a critical part of world-class capability building and would 
enable fintechs to build resilient automated organizations that foster personal growth and 
performance and attract and retain top talent.  

Looking beyond the organization, it is vital that fintechs have robust stakeholder engagement 
processes in place, including systems to report regularly to shareholders and actively manage 
regulatory change to ensure the company is compliant, especially while expanding its offering 
and entering new countries. In short, the pace of innovation needs to be balanced with 
regulatory compliance. 

There are several factors driving an increasing need for tech firms that are scaling up to manage 
risk and compliance effectively, and three stand out as particularly important. First, rising 
interest rates and potentially volatile geopolitical and macro-economic environments may lead 
to unstable market conditions and risk valuations. Second, there are intensified expectations 
from regulators and customers, resulting in increasing requirements for due diligence before 
customers can buy products and services. And third, as firms evolve to larger corporations, 
risk management becomes a greater statutory responsibility, which means that fintechs can no 
longer rely solely on their experienced management teams to avoid risk.

For fintechs walking the line between managing scarcity and navigating uncertain 
environments, scaling and reaching profitability are likely to require a degree of dexterity and 
good planning. In moving forward, African fintechs may need to explore new ways to create 
value and secure the necessary funding and resources to forge a sustainable growth path. For 
this, they can look to today’s market leaders for inspiration.

A robust talent strategy and clear HR processes 
are a critical part of world-class capability 
building and would enable fintechs to build 
resilient automated organizations that foster 
personal growth and performance and attract 
and retain top talent.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginning3. African fintech’s 
winning formula for 
long-term success

As digital transformation accelerates across the continent, Africa’s population has shown itself 
eager and ready to adopt emerging financial technologies. However, for fintechs entering 
the market, there are no quick wins on the continent. When it comes to building a sustainable 
business and creating long-term success, African fintechs may need to be prepared to play a 
long game. Not only is the African market highly fragmented—consisting of 54 countries with 
varying levels of financial literacy and internet penetration—but variable digital infrastructure, 
low consumer purchasing power, complex and inconsistent regulations, and a competitive 
playing field can all hinder sustainable growth for fintechs. Succeeding in Africa takes a 
special blend of talent, perseverance, and strategic ability. 

While it is still early days and, as Idris Bello of LoftyInc Capital Management points out, “hard 
to call anyone a winner because the race has just begun,” we think that there are some clear 
signs of what’s driving success in African markets. Our analysis shows that the most successful 
African fintechs tend to share a common set of characteristics, with features that mirror those of 
successful global companies, but also with adaptations to their business models that recognize 
the unique economic realities and customer needs of Africa (Exhibit 13).

1. Match value proposition to the market 

Successful fintechs seek first to understand the market, including customer needs and where 
the specific market stands on its infrastructure development journey. Once established in the 
market, they expand their offering with a raft of tech-based B2B and B2C products and solutions 
that address specific financial needs and plug gaps in the local financial services industries. 

Globally, the market evolution for fintech companies has typically proceeded according to one of 
three scenarios (Exhibit 14). The first route to scale echoes the strategies of companies such as 
the Alibaba Group, a multinational technology company based in China, which amassed  
150 million users before launching Alipay, a payment super app and digital wallet. This strategy 
sees companies set out as unique distributors of non-financial products, with the intention of 
growing their customer base. Having established themselves, they expand their offering to 
include basic financial products such as digital wallets and payment technology, before adding 
more complex financial services such as lending or savings, and ultimately evolving their own 
digital financial ecosystem or super app.

needs for merchants) that would help 
to deliver cash and engage  
on transactions

Take regulation seriously and 
constantly align with regulatory 
policies. Act as a partner with 
regulators and help them achieve 
their vision for the country

Like Alipay, in Africa, Safaricom and Vodafone established large and successful businesses 
with thriving customer bases before collaboratively launching M-Pesa as a mobile-based digital 
wallet targeting unbanked pre-paid mobile subscribers in Kenya. M-Pesa’s services have since 
expanded to include payments, lending, and savings, enabled through the M-Pesa network. 
Today, M-Pesa customers can also access a wide array of financial and lifestyle services, such as 
airtime, transport, health, and money-management tools. 

A second strategy sees fintechs choosing to launch directly into the financial services market 
with a specific B2B or B2C financial product that bridges an infrastructure gap or meets an 
urgent merchant or customer need before expanding into other services and regions, and 
ultimately transforming into a licensed digital bank. While wallets and super apps are typical 
entry products, fintechs have also found success launching lending products as a market-entry 
strategy. In Kenya, Tala first launched its mobile application to offer credit and collateral-free 
loans to consumers, and to date has disbursed loans of more than $2.7 billion.53 Although 
credit remains its flagship offering, Tala continues to gain traction, and has evolved to provide 
savings and money management tools, and has even expanded to other regions, including the 
Philippines, Mexico, and India. FairMoney, launched in Nigeria in 2017, followed a similar pathway. 
Starting out as an online lender offering instant loans and bill payments, it now also provides a 
bank account with free transfers and a debit card and holds a microfinance bank license from the 
Central Bank of Nigeria. In 2020, FairMoney disbursed loans worth $93 million to over 1.3 million 
users through more than 6.5 million loan applications.54

Expand

A third strategy sees fintechs focusing on the development of infrastructure that considers 
the unique circumstances and needs of the country in which they operate (Exhibit 15). For 
example, Interswitch established Nigeria’s first transaction and switching infrastructure in the 
country between 2002 and 2007, paving the way for payment acceptance across the country 
and enabling it to pioneer Africa’s largest card scheme—Verve—with payment acceptance in 
Nigeria and over 185 countries globally. Interswitch has since expanded its capabilities and 
geographic footprint.

Because African countries are still developing economies with considerable gaps in financial 
infrastructure, the continent’s oldest fintech companies—including Interswitch and Flutterwave 
in Nigeria and Fawry in Egypt—all started out by building financial infrastructure to serve the 
market, and are now the industry leaders. Followers started to build more complex B2B and B2C 
products that address specific financial needs, starting with mobile money.

There are currently more than 250 million registered mobile money accounts across Africa.55 
Historically under-banked African countries have seen mobile money become a fiercely 
contested space, with the digital wallet space growing increasingly crowded as technology 
innovation looks to shake cash from its position as the most common mode of transaction.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginning 
Although fintechs have a significant market share of mobile money, telcos still lead this space, 
and newcomers face pressure when attempting to establish themselves. In Cameroon, for 
example, the mobile money service YUP recently announced it would be shutting down 
operations just five years after launching. This can be attributed in part to the existence of the 
country’s two main mobile operators (MTN and Orange) that entered the local market almost 
ten years before YUP and have had the opportunity to establish networks that make it more 
challenging for new ventures to enter.   

While competition for wallets and mobile money customers is intense, lending and saving 
services, together with digital banks, remain a key growth opportunity in markets where payment 
infrastructure is already established such as Kenya and South Africa, but few players have 
reached significant scale.

Credit penetration on the continent remains low compared to global indicators and lending in 
Africa focuses on relatively low-risk customers, B2B lending, infrastructure tasks, on-demand 
access to wages, and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) credit in partnership with online and offline 
retail stores. The global average credit card penetration is 19 percent, eclipsing African countries 
like Kenya (6 percent), Egypt (3 percent), and even South Africa (9 percent).56

As of 2018, only 11 percent of Africa’s population had their credit information recorded by private 
credit bureaus, compared to 17 percent in emerging Asia and 79 percent in Latin America.57 Since 
traditional banks rely on consumer credit models to evaluate risk and credit bureau coverage 
remains low, large swathes of the population are excluded from the world of credit. By contrast, 
fintechs have been able to onboard customers rapidly, offering sleek customer experiences and 
unsecured loans that do not require collateral or face-to-face conversations, with credit scoring 
backed by data derived from payment and other transactions. In Kenya, the fintech Tala’s credit-
led approach to digital banking is enabled through leveraging users’ phone data and activities 
(for instance, the frequency and timeliness of paying phone bills) to generate credit scores. 
Similarly, in South Africa, Jumo facilitates digital financial services such as credit and savings, 
leveraging an unconventional digital credit model that does not require customers to have prior 
financial account ownership or a credit history. Loan decisions are automated and the digital 
credit application process happens over a mobile device with no need for in-person interactions. 

As of 2018, only 11 percent of Africa’s 
population had their credit information 
recorded by private credit bureaus, compared 
to 17 percent in emerging Asia and 79 percent 
in Latin America.

2. Acquire a large base of active users quickly

Africa’s fast-growing population of more than 1.3 billion people offers a large potential market 
for fintechs to connect with. However, customer acquisition and sustainable growth may be 
hampered by infrastructure constraints and low customer purchasing power. Fintech leaders 
in Africa have typically adopted one of two client acquisition strategies—pricing or physical 
network distribution—to enable them to scale their number of customers and grow more quickly 
than incumbents.

For instance, some of the biggest players across the continent have overcome infrastructure 
challenges by leveraging pre-existing physical networks to reach their customers and build 
their base. OPay in Nigeria has grown its business by building a vast agency network of more 
than 300,000 agents to counteract the lack of infrastructure in that country.58 PalmPay has 
taken a different rout, pre-installing their application on selected smartphone devices to 
encourage usage.59

$20 

Average customer 
acquisition cost 
vs $7 revenue

Digitally enabled fintechs have also frequently chosen to employ aggressive pricing strategies to 
drive rapid customer acquisition and market-share growth, offering cheaper fees and charges 
than traditional banking systems. Zero-cost bank accounts and reduced or free transfer costs 
have led to a shake-up in the mobile money industry. In Senegal, Wave’s aggressive pricing 
strategies, which apply a fixed transaction fee of 1 percent, influenced Orange, the largest telco 
in the country, to lower its prices to remain competitive. According to Aminata Kane, this trend 
is likely to continue: “The landscape is driving local transfer transaction prices towards almost 
zero—it’s a matter of time until what happened to Senegal … will happen across Africa.” 60 Indeed, 
other experts we have spoken to agree that aggressive pricing strategies have helped at least 
four digital players on the continent (OPay, Wave, Palmpay, and Chipper) to gain customer share 
rapidly over the past three years. 

However, strategies such as these may come at a cost, as customer loyalty is not guaranteed. 
Fintechs that wish to build long-term sustainability may also need to focus on customer retention 
and supporting healthy revenues by diversifying their offering to offset the risk of customers 
leaving for businesses that offer similar services at even lower prices. 

3. Have clear monetization strategies that are rolled out effectively

Globally, B2C fintech companies tend to invest heavily in customer acquisition, putting growth-
at-scale ahead of profits. But to convert a large customer base into reliable revenues, fintechs 
need to develop strong and effective monetization strategies. 

Companies that have a long history of operations in Africa have either had a repeatable 
and healthy revenue source that comes from a core activity, for example card switching for 
Interswitch or serving merchants with point-of-sale (POS) for Yoco, or they have developed 
multiple monetization strategies, such as adding a B2C arm to a B2B company or vice versa. For 
example, OPay has now diversified its services to include airtime, bill payments, remittances, 
and lifestyle services, as well as merchant services like payment gateways, merchant POS, 
and lending, in order to retain its customers and support healthy revenues going forward.61 
McKinsey estimates that in Africa, customer acquisition costs for fintechs are significantly higher 
than revenue earned per customer, with some companies spending as much as $20 for every 
customer acquired while generating just $7 revenue.

To cover costs, African B2C fintechs tend to focus on doing business at scale, a strategy that 
will ultimately reduce their per-customer acquisition costs and enable them to reap the rewards. 
Second, a key source of revenue for B2C players comes from the fees charged to merchants 
when they accept payments from users’ digital wallets or cards. Merchants’ acceptance of a 
fintech company’s wallet or card is usually decided by the size of its customer base and how 
widespread its usage is. To secure additional revenue sources, most fintechs that started out 
as consumer-facing businesses are now also expanding to serve merchants by, for example, 
introducing multi-purpose payment gateways for merchants, engaging merchants to accept 
payments from their wallets, or offering offline payment services through POS and mobile 
POS. For example, Paga has launched a business platform, Doroki, to target small-to-medium 
businesses that enables merchants to collect and reconcile payments seamlessly.  

B2B players, by contrast, tend to have significantly better unit economics, monetizing their 
merchant customer base and generating revenues early without sacrificing profits. In fact, 
McKinsey analysis finds that revenues generated by African B2B businesses are almost 
comparable to global fintechs, both in terms of absolute revenue and in terms of revenue per 
customer, with some companies seeing a return on investment nearly double their average 
investment per customer.

61   Company website.

39

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningTo generate new revenues, leading B2B players are now looking at ways to add B2C services 
to their portfolio by, for example, increasing revenue from consumers directly, as Interswitch 
is doing with its B2C wallet, or by increasing fees from merchants that accept payments from 
customers using wallets and cards they have introduced. 

4. Manage lower expected revenue per customer 

Africa has the lowest-income population on the planet, with personal consumption expenditure 
(PCE) that may be up to ten times lower than that of North America and five times lower than 
in Europe. Since low PCE levels can limit the potential revenues per customer for African B2C 
fintechs, products, services, and operating models are being adjusted to take this into account. 
The African micro, small, and medium-enterprise sector also creates much less value compared 
to North America and Europe, which similarly limits B2B service revenues.62 

Leading fintech players are employing a variety of strategies to adjust to this environment, 
including using scale to reduce costs of serving customers, reducing operating costs by offering 
low-priced products to customers through the use of cloud-based technologies, adjusting 
business models, and developing alternative data sources and scoring to enable customers to 
access lending services. For instance, TymeBank is using innovative technologies and cloud 
platforms to reduce operating costs, while FairMoney and Tala are using non-traditional data 
sources to assess credit risk, enabling them to offer instant loans in countries where credit 
bureau data is scarce. Meanwhile, Yoco has adapted to a ‘pay-as-you-go’ business model, only 
charging fees for actual transactions, which allows them to serve businesses that can’t afford 
advance payments for pricey POS devices.63

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginning5. Understand and address Africa’s offline market 

Most African countries are far behind developed countries when it comes to penetration of 
bank branches and formal ATMs. In Nigeria, for example, there are only four bank branches,  
17 ATMs, and 147 POS devices for every 100,000 people compared to North America, which 
has 25 branches, 210 ATMs, and a vast network of nearly 3,000 POS systems for every 
100,000 people.64 Since reaching clients offline is a key ingredient for success in Africa, 
fintechs are overcoming this challenge in a variety of ways. 

One strategy is to utilize pre-existing infrastructure to increase penetration into the market. 
TymeBank, in South Africa, has taken advantage of an existing retail store infrastructure by 
partnering with two major retail chains that enjoy a wide footprint in the country at over 700 
stores.65 Not only has TymeBank been able to eliminate the need for physical branches while 
maintaining a national physical presence, it has also been able to reduce its operating costs.  
This saving is passed on to their customers, providing millions of unbanked South Africans with 
low-cost financial access. 

Using pre-existing networks such as a mobile network, as M-Pesa did, or pre-installation of apps 
on smartphones, as PalmPay did, could be another way to sidestep the infrastructure challenge.

The development of agent networks as a substitute for brick-and-mortar environments has 
become a key growth strategy for fintechs on the continent. Nigeria, for instance, has a network 
of over 700 mobile money and banking agents for every 100,000 adults, with 43 agents for each 
ATM in the country. In Kenya the numbers are even higher, with 1,322 agents for every 100,000 
adults and 189 agents per ATM. Agent networks enable fintech players to grow their customer 
base, facilitate transactions, onboard merchants, and build trust in the brand. They also represent 
a prime job-creation opportunity, especially for young people. GSMA estimates that the mobile 
industry in sub-Saharan Africa directly employed 1.2 million youth in 2018, and this number is 
expected to grow to 1.5 million by 2025.66

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginningTelcos, fintechs, and banks are all significant players in the agency banking landscape, each 
with their own strengths and weaknesses. Telcos like M-Pesa and MTN have the advantage 
of a large pre-existing network of agents (600,000 agents and 800,000 agents countrywide 
respectively).67 Banks’ agent networks are smaller, ranging from 15,000 to 100,000; however, 
they benefit from being able to leverage their physical branches to facilitate training and 
management.68 Of the three players, fintechs have the largest pool of financially trained agents. 
OPay has approximately 300,000 agents, while in Egypt, Fawry had 166,500 active agents.69 

6. Actively engage, align with, and work with regulators

Fintechs building sustainable businesses are constantly aligning with regulatory policies, and 
having reached significant scale, they work with governments to move in a unified direction 
and gather support on a national level. Due to underdeveloped financial infrastructure, fintech 
startups may often play a critical role in enabling the economic development of African countries, 
helping to drive financial inclusion, fight poverty, and increase financial literacy. 

Leading fintechs throughout the continent engage with governments around regulation to gain 
sustainable growth potential with the support of the government. This partnering comes in many 
forms, from associating with government programs, as Fawry has done in Egypt, to providing 
solutions to state governments that enable the collection of internally generated revenues and 
taxes, as is the case with Interswitch. In Kenya, Safaricom—the owner of M-Pesa—is  
35 percent owned by the Kenyan government. The Kenyan Government, Central Bank of Kenya, 
and Safaricom have effectively worked together to build public trust through well-aligned 
initiatives that benefit Kenya’s citizens.

Companies that neglect to work with regulators and the government could be negatively 
impacted by changing regulations. For example, in March 2022, the Ghanaian government 
ordered the payment firm Dash to cease operations after the regulator noted that the Dash 
app was offering services, including cross-border payments, wallet creation, and bill payment 
services, without approval from the Central Bank.70 Board Member at the Africa Fintech Network 
and investor, Ali Hussein Kassim, believes it is therefore critical for fintechs with serious long-
term ambitions for scale to partner with regulators and help them to achieve their vision for a 
particular country or region.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginning4. Let there  
be digital: 
Building Africa’s 
fintech future

Successful African fintechs are laying down the path for others to follow. And as digital adoption 
accelerates in Africa, the fintech sector is poised for further growth. To capitalize on the 
momentum of the past few years, all stakeholders have a critical part to play. We believe a set of 
tangible, pragmatic steps could help unlock the next wave of growth. 

Regulators: A focus on predictability, flexibility, and scalability

Given the impact of the regulatory environment on both fintech growth and financial inclusion, 
it is likely to be in the interest of all—consumers, policymakers, and the industry—to work with 
fintechs and financial service incumbents to promote predictability and keep pace with the fast-
changing flow of information on emerging technologies, while also building uniform regulatory 
policies across regions and the whole continent to enable smooth cross-border transactions and 
stimulate economic growth. 

Regulators may also help to increase the flexibility and scalability of fintech services and 
infrastructure by encouraging digital reporting and data mastery and developing formal data 
systems that are centralized and protected. 

Fintechs and incumbents: A focus on partnerships and talent

Fintechs and incumbents both play a pivotal role when it comes to the long-term growth of the 
sector, particularly with regard to driving engagement with regulators to help create alignment 
and mitigate operational risks. Partnerships could be critical for long-term success, not just with 
regulators, but also with each other to enable a shared economy. Fintechs’ ability to respond 
quickly to market needs and their strength in product development and rapid innovation could 
be complemented by incumbents’ experience in navigating regulatory environments, their wide 
range of products and capabilities, and better brand awareness and trust with consumers.

Fintechs and incumbents could also both take an active role in supporting the development of 
a skilled pool of talent necessary for growth and innovation at scale. While there is currently 
a shortage of sufficient experienced local talent in Africa to grow the market, a large, young, 
digitally-native African population offers significant potential. By supporting the growth 
of training and skills development through informal technological education programs and 
training opportunities and focusing on recruiting and rewarding talent with strong IT and data 
capabilities, fintechs and incumbents could develop the skills and expertise they need from local 
populations to help drive growth.

Fintech in Africa: The end of the beginning 
A focus on reducing cost and increasing access is also likely to be critical. In this, incumbents 
can leverage their existing infrastructure and networks, including branches, ATMs, and agents, 
to expand their service offering to reach underserved populations while fintechs, with their 
tech-led models and lower operating costs, are well positioned to reach SMEs in particular, 
but they may have to consider venturing offline to acquire them. Underserved SMEs remain an 
open opportunity for financial services. In South Africa, more than 95 percent of SMEs are micro 
enterprises with less than ten employees, and more than 80 percent of these are informal or 
unregistered businesses.71

Investors: A focus on value over valuation

The role of investors is equally vital, particularly when it comes to identifying opportunities for 
further growth and expansion. Investors could contribute by focusing locally for the next set 
of opportunities and educating African investors about opportunities they identify. Second, 
investors could focus on the actual value added by startups rather than just their market 
valuation by identifying sustainable investments, assisting in developing positive unit economics, 
and investing in portfolio ecosystems instead of large one-off bets. 

Fintechs that achieve sustainability in the next phase are likely to have a clear value 
proposition and be disciplined and well run. As Jumanne Mtambalike, CEO of investment firm 
Sahara Ventures, writes: “Whether we call them ‘Zebracons’ or ‘Camels’ we need to find a way 
to make African startups look more like African businesses and not vehicles created to be sold 
to the highest bidders in the PE and stock markets.” 72

***

Fintech players in Africa have much to be bullish about. The industry has reached the end of 
its beginning. Strong foundations have been laid; infrastructure is in place, funding has been 
growing, value is being generated, and people are coming online at a faster pace than ever 
before. Now is the time to consolidate and push further. There are still many white spaces and 
underserved opportunities in all 11 opportunity markets identified in this report. However, 
the path ahead will not be without its challenges; a tightening funding environment, ongoing 
challenges with fragmentation, and a scarcity of talent are just some of the factors that will likely 
put pressure on Africa’s nascent fintech sector in the months ahead. Nevertheless, thanks to the 
momentum that has been built over the past several years, the prospects for African fintech have 
never been better. With the right incentives and support, the next marvel of African unicorns is 
just waiting to be released.
