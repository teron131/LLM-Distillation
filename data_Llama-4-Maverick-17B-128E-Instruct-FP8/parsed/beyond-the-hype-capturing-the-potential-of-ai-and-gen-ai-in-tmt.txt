Introduction: The promise and 
the challenge of generative AI

The emergence of generative AI (gen AI) presents both a challenge and a significant opportunity for leaders looking 
to steer their organizations into the future. How big is the opportunity? McKinsey research estimates that gen AI 
could add to the economy between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually while increasing the impact of all artificial 
intelligence by 15 to 40 percent. In the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) space, new gen AI use 
cases are expected to unleash between $380 billion and $690 billion in impact—$60 billion to $100 billion in 
telecommunications, $80 billion to $130 billion in media, and about $240 billion to $460 billion in high tech. In 
fact, it seems possible that within the next three years, anything not connected to AI will be considered obsolete or 
ineffective. 

Some leaders are moving to seize the moment and implement gen AI in their organizations at scale, but others remain 
in the pilot stage, and some have yet to decide what to do. If companies are to remain competitive and relevant in the 
coming years, it is essential that executives understand the potential impact of gen AI and develop the strategies 
necessary to incorporate it into their operations. Such strategies would involve an AI-native transformation, focused 
on building and managing the adoption of gen AI. McKinsey has conducted extensive research into how to embed 
gen AI to ensure that the technology delivers meaningful value. We’ve also spent much of the past year working with 
clients to create and then implement gen AI road maps. That combination of research and hands-on experience has 
allowed us to identify more than 100 gen AI use cases in TMT across seven business domains.1  

Our experience working with clients already indicates the potential for telcos to achieve significant impact with 
gen AI across all key functions. The largest share of total impact will likely be in customer care and sales, which 
together would account for approximately 70 percent of total impact; network operations, IT, and support functions 
would round out the rest. The technology already is showing meaningful impact in enhancing interactions between 
employees and customers: the personalization of products and campaigns, improvements in sales effectiveness, and 
a reduction in time to market can spark a potential revenue increase of 3 to 5 percent. Customer care interactions—
where as much as 50 percent of activity could be automated—have potential for a 30 to 45 percent increase in 
productivity while improving the customer experience and customer satisfaction scores. On the labor side, up to 70 
percent of repetitive work activities could be automated via gen AI to improve productivity. There is also potential for 
new efficiencies in knowledge search, validation, and synthesis, where some 60 percent of activity has the potential 
for automation. And gen AI tools could boost developer productivity by 20 to 45 percent.

These areas provide rich soil for use cases. More challenging will be to go from sketching a road map to building 
proofs of concept to scaling successfully and capturing impact. Years of experience in designing and implementing 
digital transformations have taught us a lot, but gen AI’s nature and speed of disruption are creating a new layer of 
uncertainty. 

Becoming an AI-native organization at scale involves making the most of technology, data, and governance. Success 
follows when leaders embrace an operating model that leverages the strengths of both humans and machines; is 
rooted in agility, flexibility, and continuous learning; and is supported by strong data and analytics talent. Another 
condition of success is to invest in data quality and quantity, focusing on the data life cycle to ensure high-quality 
information for training the gen AI model. Building capabilities into the data architecture, such as vector databases 
and data pre- and post-processing pipelines, will enable the development of use cases. Talent, data, technology, 
governance—none of these can be an afterthought.

Successful implementations share a clear vision and decisive approach. We advise that financial plans maintain or 
increase gen AI budgets over the next year. These budgets should include resources dedicated to gen AI for the shaping 
and crafting of bespoke solutions (for example, training large language models with telco-specific data, rather than 
implementing off-the-shelf ones) or partnerships with IT vendors to accelerate the timeline for implementation.

The AI journey has been shown to contain many challenges and learning opportunities, such as preparing and shifting 
an organization’s culture, finding data sets of significant size, and addressing the interpretability of the outputs provided 
by models. Leaders should expect such daunting challenges as a shortage of talent, lack of organizational commitment 
and prioritization (including among C-level executives), and difficulties in justifying ROI for certain business cases, all 
amid a changing regulatory and ethics landscape that creates further uncertainty. But daunting does not have to mean 
impossible. Developing a system of protocols and guardrails (such as building “moderation” models to check outputs 
for different risks and ensure users receive consistent responses) will be a crucial step toward mitigating the new risks 
introduced by gen AI. Another key will be change management—involving end users in the model development process 
and deeply embedding technology into their operations.

This collection presents McKinsey’s top insights on gen AI, providing a detailed examination of this technology’s 
transformative potential for organizations. It offers top management guidance on how to prepare for the implementation 
of gen AI and explores the implications of gen AI’s use by the TMT industries, especially telecommunications. The 
collection covers the essential requirements for deploying gen AI, including organizational readiness, data management, 
and technological considerations. It also emphasizes the importance of effectively managing risks associated with gen 
AI implementation. Furthermore, this compilation offers an overview of the future developments and advancements 
expected in the field of generative AI.

Gen AI will continue to evolve. New capabilities, such as the ability to analyze and comprehend images or audio, and an 
expanding ecosystem with marketplaces for GPT (generative pretrained transformers), are constantly emerging. For 
leaders, the stakes are high. But so are the opportunities. The next move from TMT players will define how they move 
from isolated cases to implementations at scale, from hype to impact.

Generative AI as a 
technology catalyst

To grasp what lies ahead requires an understanding of the breakthroughs that have enabled the rise 
of generative AI, which were decades in the making. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Stable Diff usion, and 
other generative AI tools that have captured current public attention are the result of signifi cant levels 
of investment in recent years that have helped advance machine learning and deep learning. This 
investment undergirds the AI applications embedded in many of the products and services we use 
every day. 

But because AI has permeated our lives incrementally—through everything from the tech powering 
our smartphones to autonomous-driving features on cars to the tools retailers use to surprise and 
delight consumers—its progress was almost imperceptible. Clear milestones, such as when AlphaGo, 
an AI-based program developed by DeepMind, defeated a world champion Go player in 2016, were 
celebrated but then quickly faded from the public’s consciousness.

ChatGPT and its competitors have captured the imagination of people around the world in a way 
AlphaGo did not, thanks to their broad utility—almost anyone can use them to communicate and 
create—and preternatural ability to have a conversation with a user. The latest generative AI 
applications can perform a range of routine tasks, such as the reorganization and classifi cation

of data. But it is their ability to write text, compose music, and create digital art that has garnered 
headlines and persuaded consumers and households to experiment on their own. As a result, a 
broader set of stakeholders are grappling with generative AI’s impact on business and society but 
without much context to help them make sense of it.

How did we get here? Gradually, then all of a sudden 

For the purposes of this report, we define generative AI as applications typically built using foundation 
models. These models contain expansive artificial neural networks inspired by the billions of neurons 
connected in the human brain. Foundation models are part of what is called deep learning, a term 
that alludes to the many deep layers within neural networks. Deep learning has powered many of 
the recent advances in AI, but the foundation models powering generative AI applications are a step 
change evolution within deep learning. Unlike previous deep learning models, they can process 
extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data and perform more than one task. 

Foundation models have enabled new capabilities and vastly improved existing ones across a broad 
range of modalities, including images, video, audio, and computer code. AI trained on these models 
can perform several functions; it can classify, edit, summarize, answer questions, and draft new 
content, among other tasks. 

Continued innovation will also bring new challenges. For example, the computational power required 
to train generative AI with hundreds of billions of parameters threatens to become a bottleneck in 
development.¹ Further, there’s a significant move—spearheaded by the open-source community and 
spreading to the leaders of generative AI companies themselves—to make AI more responsible, which 
could increase its costs. 

Nonetheless, funding for generative AI, though still a fraction of total investments in artificial 
intelligence, is significant and growing rapidly—reaching a total of $12 billion in the first five months 
of 2023 alone. Venture capital and other private external investments in generative AI increased by 
an average compound growth rate of 74 percent annually from 2017 to 2022. During the same period, 
investments in artificial intelligence overall rose annually by 29 percent, albeit from a higher base. 

The rush to throw money at all things generative AI reflects how quickly its capabilities have 
developed. ChatGPT was released in November 2022. Four months later, OpenAI released a new 
large language model, or LLM, called GPT-4 with markedly improved capabilities.² Similarly, by May 
2023, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, was able to process 100,000 tokens of text, equal to about 
75,000 words in a minute—the length of the average novel—compared with roughly 9,000 tokens 
when it was introduced in March 2023.³ And in May 2023, Google announced several new features 
powered by generative AI, including Search Generative Experience and a new LLM called PaLM 2 that 
will power its Bard chatbot, among other Google products.⁴

From a geographic perspective, external private investment in generative AI, mostly from tech 
giants and venture capital firms, is largely concentrated in North America, reflecting the continent’s 
current domination of the overall AI investment landscape. Generative AI–related companies based 
in the United States raised about $8 billion from 2020 to 2022, accounting for 75 percent of total 
investments in such companies during that period.⁵ 

Generative AI has stunned and excited the world with its potential for reshaping how knowledge work 
gets done in industries and business functions across the entire economy. Across functions such 
as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development, it is poised to transform 
roles and boost performance. In the process, it could unlock trillions of dollars in value across sectors 
from banking to life sciences. We have used two overlapping lenses in this report to understand

McKinsey & Company

Generative AI is a step change in the evolution of artifi cial intelligence. As companies 
rush to adapt and implement it, understanding the technology’s potential to deliver value 
to the economy and society at large will help shape critical decisions. We have used two 
complementary lenses to determine where generative AI with its current capabilities could 
deliver the biggest value and how big that value could be (Exhibit 1).

The fi rst lens scans use cases for generative AI that organizations could adopt. We defi ne 
a “use case” as a targeted application of generative AI to a specifi c business challenge, 
resulting in one or more measurable outcomes. For example, a use case in marketing is the 
application of generative AI to generate creative content such as personalized emails, the 
measurable outcomes of which potentially include reductions in the cost of generating such 
content and increases in revenue from the enhanced eff ectiveness of higher-quality content 
at scale. We identifi ed 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could 
deliver total value in the range of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefi ts annually 
when applied across industries. 

That would add 15 to 40 percent to the $11.0 trillion to $17.7 trillion of economic value that we 
now estimate nongenerative artifi cial intelligence and analytics could unlock. (Our previous 
estimate from 2017 was that AI could deliver $9.5 trillion to $15.4 trillion in economic value.) 

Our second lens complements the fi rst by analyzing generative AI’s potential impact on 
the work activities required in some 850 occupations. We modeled scenarios to estimate 
when generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 “detailed work activities”—

such as “communicating with others about operational plans or activities”—that make up 
those occupations across the world economy. This enables us to estimate how the current 
capabilities of generative AI could aff ect labor productivity across all work currently done by 
the global workforce.

Some of this impact will overlap with cost reductions in the use case analysis described 
above, which we assume are the result of improved labor productivity. Netting out this

overlap, the total economic benefits of generative AI—including the major use cases we 
explored and the myriad increases in productivity that are likely to materialize when the 
technology is applied across knowledge workers’ activities—amounts to $6.1 trillion to 
$7.9 trillion annually (Exhibit 2).

While generative AI is an exciting and rapidly advancing technology, the other applications of 
AI discussed in our previous report continue to account for the majority of the overall potential 
value of AI. Traditional advanced-analytics and machine learning algorithms are highly 

Box 1
How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases

To assess the potential value of generative AI, 
we updated a proprietary McKinsey database of 
potential AI use cases and drew on the experience 
of more than 100 experts in industries and their 
business functions.1 Our updates examined 
use cases of generative AI—specifically, how 
generative AI techniques (primarily transformer-
based neural networks) can be used to solve 
problems not well addressed by previous 
technologies.

We analyzed only use cases for which generative 
AI could deliver a significant improvement in the 
outputs that drive key value. In particular, our 
estimates of the primary value the technology 
could unlock do not include use cases for which 
the sole benefit would be its ability to use natural 
language. For example, natural-language 
capabilities would be the key driver of value in 

a customer service use case but not in a use 
case optimizing a logistics network, where value 
primarily arises from quantitative analysis. 

We then estimated the potential annual value 
of these generative AI use cases if they were 
adopted across the entire economy. For use 
cases aimed at increasing revenue, such as some 
of those in sales and marketing, we estimated 
the economy-wide value generative AI could 
deliver by increasing the productivity of sales and 
marketing expenditures. 

Our estimates are based on the structure of the 
global economy in 2022 and do not consider the 
value generative AI could create if it produced 
entirely new product or service categories.

effective at performing numerical and optimization tasks such as predictive modeling, and 
they continue to find new applications in a wide range of industries. However, as generative AI 
continues to develop and mature, it has the potential to open wholly new frontiers in creativity 
and innovation. It has already expanded the possibilities of what AI overall can achieve (see 
Box 1, “How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases”).

In this chapter, we highlight the value potential of generative AI across two dimensions: 
business function and modality.

Value potential by function

While generative AI could have an impact on most business functions, a few stand out when 
measured by the technology’s impact as a share of functional cost (Exhibit 3). Our analysis 
of 16 business functions identifi ed just four—customer operations, marketing and sales, 
software engineering, and research and development—that could account for approximately 
75 percent of the total annual value from generative AI use cases.

Notably, the potential value of using generative AI for several functions that were prominent 
in our previous sizing of AI use cases, including manufacturing and supply chain functions, 
is now much lower.⁶ This is largely explained by the nature of generative AI use cases, which 
exclude most of the numerical and optimization applications that were the main value drivers 
for previous applications of AI.

Generative AI as a virtual expert
In addition to the potential value generative AI can deliver in function-specific use cases, 
the technology could drive value across an entire organization by revolutionizing internal 
knowledge management systems. Generative AI’s impressive command of natural-language 
processing can help employees retrieve stored internal knowledge by formulating queries 
in the same way they might ask a human a question and engage in continuing dialogue. This 
could empower teams to quickly access relevant information, enabling them to rapidly make 
better-informed decisions and develop effective strategies.

In 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about 
a fifth of their time, or one day each workweek, searching for and gathering information. If 
generative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
workers doing them, the benefits would be huge. Such virtual expertise could rapidly “read” 
vast libraries of corporate information stored in natural language and quickly scan source 
material in dialogue with a human who helps fine-tune and tailor its research, a more scalable 
solution than hiring a team of human experts for the task. 

Following are examples of how generative AI could produce operational benefits as a virtual 
expert in a handful of use cases.

Customer operations
Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the entire customer operations function, 
improving the customer experience and agent productivity through digital self-service 
and enhancing and augmenting agent skills. The technology has already gained traction 
in customer service because of its ability to automate interactions with customers using 
natural language. Research found that at one company with 5,000 customer service 
agents, the application of generative AI increased issue resolution by 14 percent an hour and 
reduced the time spent handling an issue by 9 percent.⁷ It also reduced agent attrition and 
requests to speak to a manager by 25 percent. Crucially, productivity and quality of service 
improved most among less-experienced agents, while the AI assistant did not increase—
and sometimes decreased—the productivity and quality metrics of more highly skilled 
agents. This is because AI assistance helped less-experienced agents communicate using 
techniques similar to those of their higher-skilled counterparts.

The following are examples of the operational improvements generative AI can have for 
specific use cases:

 — Customer self-service. Generative AI–fueled chatbots can give immediate and 

personalized responses to complex customer inquiries regardless of the language or 
location of the customer. By improving the quality and effectiveness of interactions via 
automated channels, generative AI could automate responses to a higher percentage of 
customer inquiries, enabling customer care teams to take on inquiries that can only be 
resolved by a human agent. Our research found that roughly half of customer contacts 
made by banking, telecommunications, and utilities companies in North America are 
already handled by machines, including but not exclusively AI. We estimate that generative 
AI could further reduce the volume of human-serviced contacts by up to 50 percent, 
depending on a company’s existing level of automation. 

 — Resolution during initial contact. Generative AI can instantly retrieve data a company 

has on a specific customer, which can help a human customer service representative more 
successfully answer questions and resolve issues during an initial interaction.

 — Reduced response time. Generative AI can cut the time a human sales representative 

spends responding to a customer by providing assistance in real time and recommending 
next steps. 

 — Increased sales. Because of its ability to rapidly process data on customers and their 
browsing histories, the technology can identify product suggestions and deals tailored 
to customer preferences. Additionally, generative AI can enhance quality assurance and 
coaching by gathering insights from customer conversations, determining what could be 
done better, and coaching agents. 

We estimate that applying generative AI to customer care functions could increase 
productivity at a value ranging from 30 to 45 percent of current function costs.

Our analysis captures only the direct impact generative AI might have on the productivity of 
customer operations. It does not account for potential knock-on effects the technology may 
have on customer satisfaction and retention arising from an improved experience, including 
better understanding of the customer’s context that can assist human agents in providing 
more personalized help and recommendations.

Marketing and sales
Generative AI has taken hold rapidly in marketing and sales functions, in which text-based 
communications and personalization at scale are driving forces. The technology can create 
personalized messages tailored to individual customer interests, preferences, and behaviors, 
as well as do tasks such as producing first drafts of brand advertising, headlines, slogans, 
social media posts, and product descriptions.

However, introducing generative AI to marketing functions requires careful consideration. 
For one thing, using mathematical models trained on publicly available data without 
sufficient safeguards against plagiarism, copyright violations, and branding recognition risks 
infringing on intellectual property rights. A virtual try-on application may produce biased 
representations of certain demographics because of limited or biased training data. Thus, 
significant human oversight is required for conceptual and strategic thinking specific to each 
company’s needs. 

Potential operational benefits from using generative AI for marketing include the following: 

 — Efficient and effective content creation. Generative AI could significantly reduce the 

time required for ideation and content drafting, saving valuable time and effort. It can also 
facilitate consistency across different pieces of content, ensuring a uniform brand voice, 
writing style, and format. Team members can collaborate via generative AI, which can 
integrate their ideas into a single cohesive piece. This would allow teams to significantly 
enhance personalization of marketing messages aimed at different customer segments, 
geographies, and demographics. Mass email campaigns can be instantly translated into 
as many languages as needed, with different imagery and messaging depending on the 
audience. Generative AI’s ability to produce content with varying specifications could 
increase customer value, attraction, conversion, and retention over a lifetime and at a 
scale beyond what is currently possible through traditional techniques.

 — Enhanced use of data. Generative AI could help marketing functions overcome the 
challenges of unstructured, inconsistent, and disconnected data—for example, from 
different databases—by interpreting abstract data sources such as text, image, and 
varying structures. It can help marketers better use data such as territory performance, 
synthesized customer feedback, and customer behavior to generate data-informed 
marketing strategies such as targeted customer profiles and channel recommendations. 
Such tools could identify and synthesize trends, key drivers, and market and product 
opportunities from unstructured data such as social media, news, academic research, and 
customer feedback.

 — SEO optimization. Generative AI can help marketers achieve higher conversion and 

lower cost through search engine optimization (SEO) for marketing and sales technical 
components such as page titles, image tags, and URLs. It can synthesize key SEO tokens, 
support specialists in SEO digital content creation, and distribute targeted content to 
customers.

 — Product discovery and search personalization. With generative AI, product discovery 

and search can be personalized with multimodal inputs from text, images and speech, and 
deep understanding of customer profiles. For example, technology can leverage individual 
user preferences, behavior, and purchase history to help customers discover the most

relevant products and generate personalized product descriptions. This would allow 
CPG, travel, and retail companies to improve their e-commerce sales by achieving higher 
website conversion rates. 

We estimate that generative AI could increase the productivity of the marketing function with 
a value between 5 and 15 percent of total marketing spending.

Our analysis of the potential use of generative AI in marketing doesn’t account for knock-on 
effects beyond the direct impacts on productivity. Generative AI–enabled synthesis could 
provide higher-quality data insights, leading to new ideas for marketing campaigns and 
better-targeted customer segments. Marketing functions could shift resources to producing 
higher-quality content for owned channels, potentially reducing spending on external 
channels and agencies.

Generative AI could also change the way both B2B and B2C companies approach sales. The 
following are two use cases for sales:

 — Increase probability of sale. Generative AI could identify and prioritize sales leads 

by creating comprehensive consumer profiles from structured and unstructured data 
and suggesting actions to staff to improve client engagement at every point of contact. 
For example, generative AI could provide better information about client preferences, 
potentially improving close rates. 

 — Improve lead development. Generative AI could help sales representatives nurture leads 
by synthesizing relevant product sales information and customer profiles and creating 
discussion scripts to facilitate customer conversation, including up- and cross-selling 
talking points. It could also automate sales follow-ups and passively nurture leads until 
clients are ready for direct interaction with a human sales agent.

Our analysis suggests that implementing generative AI could increase sales productivity by 
approximately 3 to 5 percent of current global sales expenditures.

This analysis may not fully account for additional revenue that generative AI could bring 
to sales functions. For instance, generative AI’s ability to identify leads and follow-up 
capabilities could uncover new leads and facilitate more effective outreach that would bring 
in additional revenue. Also, the time saved by sales representatives due to generative AI’s 
capabilities could be invested in higher-quality customer interactions, resulting in increased 
sales success.

Generative AI as a virtual collaborator
In other cases, generative AI can drive value by working in partnership with workers, 
augmenting their work in ways that accelerate their productivity. Its ability to rapidly digest 
mountains of data and draw conclusions from it enables the technology to offer insights and 
options that can dramatically enhance knowledge work. This can significantly speed up the 
process of developing a product and allow employees to devote more time to higher-impact 
tasks.

Generative AI could increase 
sales productivity by 3 to 
5 percent of current global 
sales expenditures.

Software engineering
Treating computer languages as just another language opens new possibilities for software 
engineering. Software engineers can use generative AI in pair programming and to do 
augmented coding and train LLMs to develop applications that generate code when given a 
natural-language prompt describing what that code should do.

Software engineering is a significant function in most companies, and it continues to grow 
as all large companies, not just tech titans, embed software in a wide array of products and 
services. For example, much of the value of new vehicles comes from digital features such as 
adaptive cruise control, parking assistance, and IoT connectivity.

According to our analysis, the direct impact of AI on the productivity of software engineering 
could range from 20 to 45 percent of current annual spending on the function. This value 
would arise primarily from reducing time spent on certain activities, such as generating initial 
code drafts, code correction and refactoring, root-cause analysis, and generating new system 
designs. By accelerating the coding process, generative AI could push the skill sets and 
capabilities needed in software engineering toward code and architecture design. One study 
found that software developers using Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot completed tasks 56 percent 
faster than those not using the tool.⁸ An internal McKinsey empirical study of software 
engineering teams found those who were trained to use generative AI tools rapidly reduced 
the time needed to generate and refactor code—and engineers also reported a better work 
experience, citing improvements in happiness, flow, and fulfillment. 

Our analysis did not account for the increase in application quality and the resulting boost in 
productivity that generative AI could bring by improving code or enhancing IT architecture—
which can improve productivity across the IT value chain. However, the quality of IT 
architecture still largely depends on software architects, rather than on initial drafts that 
generative AI’s current capabilities allow it to produce.

Large technology companies are already selling generative AI for software engineering, 
including GitHub Copilot, which is now integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4, and Replit, used by 
more than 20 million coders.⁹

Product R&D
Generative AI’s potential in R&D is perhaps less well recognized than its potential in other business 
functions. Still, our research indicates the technology could deliver productivity with a value ranging 
from 10 to 15 percent of overall R&D costs.

For example, the life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI foundation 
models in their R&D for what is known as generative design. Foundation models can generate 
candidate molecules, accelerating the process of developing new drugs and materials. Entos, a 
biotech pharmaceutical company, has paired generative AI with automated synthetic development 
tools to design small-molecule therapeutics. But the same principles can be applied to the design of 
many other products, including larger-scale physical products and electrical circuits, among others. 

While other generative design techniques have already unlocked some of the potential to apply AI 
in R&D, their cost and data requirements, such as the use of “traditional” machine learning, can limit 
their application. Pretrained foundation models that underpin generative AI, or models that have 
been enhanced with fine-tuning, have much broader areas of application than models optimized for 
a single task. They can therefore accelerate time to market and broaden the types of products to 
which generative design can be applied. For now, however, foundation models lack the capabilities 
to help design products across all industries.

In addition to the productivity gains that result from being able to quickly produce candidate 
designs, generative design can also enable improvements in the designs themselves, as in the 
following examples of the operational improvements generative AI could bring: 

 — Enhanced design. Generative AI can help product designers reduce costs by selecting and 

using materials more efficiently. It can also optimize designs for manufacturing, which can lead to 
cost reductions in logistics and production. 

 — Improved product testing and quality. Using generative AI in generative design can produce 
a higher-quality product, resulting in increased attractiveness and market appeal. Generative 
AI can help to reduce testing time of complex systems and accelerate trial phases involving 
customer testing through its ability to draft scenarios and profile testing candidates. 

We also identified a new R&D use case for nongenerative AI: deep learning surrogates, the use 
of which has grown since our earlier research, can be paired with generative AI to produce even 
greater benefits (see Box 2, “Deep learning surrogates”). To be sure, integration will require the 
development of specific solutions, but the value could be significant because deep learning 
surrogates have the potential to accelerate the testing of designs proposed by generative AI. 

While we have estimated the potential direct impacts of generative AI on the R&D function, we 
did not attempt to estimate the technology’s potential to create entirely novel product categories. 
These are the types of innovations that can produce step changes not only in the performance of 
individual companies but in economic growth overall.

Value potential by modality

Technology has revolutionized the way we conduct business, and text-based AI is on the frontier 
of this change. Indeed, text-based data is plentiful, accessible, and easily processed and analyzed 
at large scale by LLMs, which has prompted a strong emphasis on them in the initial stages of 
generative AI development. The current investment landscape in generative AI is also heavily 
focused on text-based applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation. 
However, we estimate that almost one-fifth of the value that generative AI can unlock across our use 
cases would take advantage of multimodal capabilities beyond text to text.

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

18

Box 2
Deep learning surrogates

Product design in industries producing 
physical products often involves physics-
based virtual simulations such as 
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and 
finite element analysis (FEA). Although 
they are faster than actual physical 
testing, these techniques can be time- 
and resource-intensive, especially for 
designing complex parts—running CFD 
simulations on graphics processing units 

can take hours. And these techniques 
are even more complex and compute-
intensive when they involve simulations 
coupled across multiple disciplines (for 
example, physical stress and temperature 
distribution), which is sometimes called 
multiphysics.

Deep learning applications are now 
revolutionizing the virtual testing phase of 

the R&D process by using deep learning 
models to emulate (multi)physics-
based simulations at higher speeds and 
lower costs. Instead of taking hours 
to run physics-based models, these 
deep learning surrogates can produce 
the results of simulations in just a few 
seconds, allowing researchers to test 
many more designs and enabling faster 
decision making on products and designs.

While most of generative AI’s initial traction has been in text-based use cases, recent advances in 
generative AI have also led to breakthroughs in image generation, as OpenAI’s DALL·E and Stable 
Diffusion have so amply illustrated, and much progress is being made in audio, including voice 
and music, and video. These capabilities have obvious applications in marketing for generating 
advertising materials and other marketing content, and these technologies are already being applied 
in media industries, including game design. Indeed, some of these examples challenge existing 
business models around talent, monetization, and intellectual property.10

The multimodal capabilities of generative AI could also be used effectively in R&D. Generative AI 
systems could create first drafts of circuit designs, architectural drawings, structural engineering 
designs, and thermal designs based on prompts that describe requirements for a product. 
Achieving this will require training foundation models in these domains (think of LLMs trained on 
“design languages”). Once trained, such foundation models could increase productivity on a similar 
magnitude to software development.

Value potential by industry

Across the 63 use cases we analyzed, generative AI has the potential to generate $2.6 trillion to $4.4 
trillion in value across industries. Its precise impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as the 
mix and importance of different functions, as well as the scale of an industry’s revenue (Exhibit 4).

For example, our analysis estimates generative AI could contribute roughly $310 billion in 
additional value for the retail industry (including auto dealerships) by boosting performance in 
functions such as marketing and customer interactions. By comparison, the bulk of potential 
value in high tech comes from generative AI’s ability to increase the speed and efficiency of 
software development.

The generative AI future 
of work: Impacts on 
work activities, economic 
growth, and productivity 

Technology has been changing the anatomy of work for decades. Over the years, machines 
have given human workers various “superpowers”; for instance, industrial-age machines 
enabled workers to accomplish physical tasks beyond the capabilities of their own bodies. 
More recently, computers have enabled knowledge workers to perform calculations that 
would have taken years to do manually. 

These examples illustrate how technology can augment work through the automation of 
individual activities that workers would have otherwise had to do themselves. At a conceptual 
level, the application of generative AI may follow the same pattern in the modern workplace, 
although as we show later in this chapter, the types of activities that generative AI could 
affect, and the types of occupations with activities that could change, will likely be different as 
a result of this technology than for older technologies.

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

22

The McKinsey Global Institute began analyzing the impact of technological automation of 
work activities and modeling scenarios of adoption in 2017. At that time, we estimated that 
workers spent half of their time on activities that had the potential to be automated by adapting 
technology that existed at that time, or what we call technical automation potential. We also 
modeled a range of potential scenarios for the pace at which these technologies could be 
adopted and affect work activities throughout the global economy. 

Technology adoption at scale does not occur overnight. The potential of technological 
capabilities in a lab does not necessarily mean they can be immediately integrated into a 
solution that automates a specific work activity—developing such solutions takes time. Even 
when such a solution is developed, it might not be economically feasible to use if its costs 
exceed those of human labor. Additionally, even if economic incentives for deployment exist, it 
takes time for adoption to spread across the global economy. Hence, our adoption scenarios, 
which consider these factors together with the technical automation potential, provide a sense 
of the pace and scale at which workers’ activities could shift over time.

Large-scale shifts in the mix of work activities and occupations are not unprecedented. 
Consider the work of a farmer today compared with what a farmer did just a few short years 
ago. Many farmers now access market information on mobile phones to determine when and 
where to sell their crops or download sophisticated modeling of weather patterns. From a more 
macro perspective, agricultural employment in China went from an 82 percent share of all 
workers in 1962 to 13 percent in 2013. Labor markets are also dynamic: millions of people leave 
their jobs every month in the United States.11 But this does not minimize the challenges faced 
by individual workers whose lives are upended by these shifts, or the organizational or societal 
challenges of ensuring that workers have the skills to take on the work that will be in demand 
and that their incomes are sufficient to grow their standards of living. 

Also, demographics have made such shifts in activities a necessity from a macroeconomic 
perspective. An economic growth gap has opened as a result of the slowing growth of the 
world’s workforce. In some major countries, workforces have shrunk because populations are 
aging. Labor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance 
prosperity.

The analyses in this paper incorporate the potential impact of generative AI on today’s work 
activities. The new capabilities of generative AI, combined with previous technologies and 
integrated into corporate operations around the world, could accelerate the potential for 
technical automation of individual activities and the adoption of technologies that augment the 
capabilities of the workforce. They could also have an impact on knowledge workers whose 
activities were not expected to shift as a result of these technologies until later in the future.

Accelerating the technical potential to transform knowledge work

Based on developments in generative AI, technology performance is now expected to 
match median human performance and reach top-quartile human performance earlier 
than previously estimated across a wide range of capabilities (Exhibit 5). For example, MGI 
previously identifi ed 2027 as the earliest year when median human performance for natural-
language understanding might be achieved in technology, but in this new analysis, the 
corresponding point is 2023.

As a result of generative AI, experts assess that technology could achieve human-
level performance in some technical capabilities sooner than previously thought.

As a result of these reassessments of technology capabilities due to generative AI, the total 
percentage of hours that could theoretically be automated by integrating technologies that exist 
today has increased from about 50 percent to 60 to 70 percent. The technical potential curve is 
quite steep because of the acceleration in generative AI’s natural-language capabilities (Exhibit 6).

Interestingly, the range of times between the early and late scenarios has compressed compared 
with the expert assessments in 2017, refl ecting a greater confi dence that higher levels of 
technological capabilities will arrive by certain time periods.

Generative AI could propel higher productivity growth

Global economic growth was slower from 2012 to 2022 than in the two preceding decades.12
Although the COVID-19 pandemic was a signifi cant factor, long-term structural challenges—
including declining birth rates and aging populations—are ongoing obstacles to growth. 

Declining employment is among those obstacles. Compound annual growth in the total number 
of workers worldwide slowed from 2.5 percent in 1972–82 to just 0.8 percent in 2012–22, 
largely because of aging. In many large countries, the size of the workforce is already declining.13

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

25

Productivity, which measures output relative to input, or the value of goods and services 
produced divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required to produce 
them, was the main engine of economic growth in the three decades from 1992 to 2022 
(Exhibit 7). However, since then, productivity growth has slowed in tandem with slowing 
employment growth, confounding economists and policy makers.14

The deployment of generative AI and other technologies could help accelerate productivity 
growth, partially compensating for declining employment growth and enabling overall 
economic growth. Based on our estimates, the automation of individual work activities 
enabled by these technologies could provide the global economy with an annual productivity 
boost of 0.5 to 3.4 percent from 2023 to 2040 depending on the rate of automation 
adoption—with generative AI contributing to 0.1 to 0.6 percentage points of that growth—but 
only if individuals aff ected by the technology were to shift to other work activities that at 
least match their 2022 productivity levels (Exhibit 8). In some cases, workers will stay in the 
same occupations, but their mix of activities will shift; in others, workers will need to shift 
occupations.

The capabilities of generative AI vastly expand the pool of work activities with the potential for 
technical automation. That in turn has sped up the pace at which automation may be deployed and 
expanded the types of workers who will experience its impact. Like other technologies, its ability 
to take on routine tasks and work can increase human productivity, which has grown at a below-
average rate for almost 20 years.15 It can also off set the impact of aging, which is beginning to put a 
dent in workforce growth for many of the world’s major economies. But to achieve these benefi ts, 
a signifi cant number of workers will need to substantially change the work they do, either in their 
existing occupations or in new ones. They will also need support in making transitions to new 
activities.

Considerations for 
businesses and society

History has shown that new technologies have the potential to reshape societies. Artificial 
intelligence has already changed the way we live and work—for example, it can help our phones 
(mostly) understand what we say, or draft emails. Mostly, however, AI has remained behind the 
scenes, optimizing business processes or making recommendations about the next product to buy. 
The rapid development of generative AI is likely to significantly augment the impact of AI overall, 
generating trillions of dollars of additional value each year and transforming the nature of work.

But the technology could also deliver new and significant challenges. Stakeholders must act—and 
quickly, given the pace at which generative AI could be adopted—to prepare to address both the 
opportunities and the risks. Risks have already surfaced, including concerns about the content that 
generative AI systems produce: Will they infringe upon intellectual property due to “plagiarism” 
in the training data used to create foundation models? Will the answers that LLMs produce when 
questioned be accurate, and can they be explained? Will the content that generative AI creates 
be fair or biased in ways that users do not want by, say, producing content that reflects harmful 
stereotypes?

There are economic challenges too: the scale and the scope of the workforce transitions described 
in this report are considerable. In the midpoint adoption scenario, about a quarter to a third of 
work activities could change in the coming decade. The task before us is to manage the potential 

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

28

positives and negatives of the technology simultaneously (for more about the potential risks of 
generative AI, see Box 3, “Using generative AI responsibly”). Here are some of the critical questions 
we will need to address while balancing our enthusiasm for the potential benefits of the technology 
with the new challenges it can introduce. 

Companies and business leaders
How can companies move quickly to capture the potential value at stake highlighted in this report, 
while managing the risks that generative AI presents?

Box 3
Using generative AI responsibly

Generative AI poses a variety of risks. 
Stakeholders will want to address these 
risks from the start. 

Fairness: Models may generate 
algorithmic bias due to imperfect training 
data or decisions made by the engineers 
developing the models.

Intellectual property (IP): Training 
data and model outputs can generate 
significant IP risks, including infringing 
on copyrighted, trademarked, patented, 
or otherwise legally protected materials. 
Even when using a provider’s generative 
AI tool, organizations will need to 
understand what data went into training 
and how it’s used in tool outputs.

Privacy: Privacy concerns could arise if 
users input information that later ends 
up in model outputs in a form that makes 

individuals identifiable. Generative 
AI could also be used to create and 
disseminate malicious content such as 
disinformation, deepfakes, and hate 
speech.

Security: Generative AI may be 
used by bad actors to accelerate the 
sophistication and speed of cyberattacks. 
It also can be manipulated to provide 
malicious outputs. For example, through a 
technique called prompt injection, a third 
party gives a model new instructions that 
trick the model into delivering an output 
unintended by the model producer and 
end user.

Explainability: Generative AI relies 
on neural networks with billions of 
parameters, challenging our ability 

to explain how any given answer is 
produced.

Reliability: Models can produce different 
answers to the same prompts, impeding 
the user’s ability to assess the accuracy 
and reliability of outputs.

Organizational impact: Generative AI 
may significantly affect the workforce, 
and the impact on specific groups 
and local communities could be 
disproportionately negative.

Social and environmental impact: The 
development and training of foundation 
models may lead to detrimental social and 
environmental consequences, including 
an increase in carbon emissions (for 
example, training one large language 
model can emit about 315 tons of carbon 
dioxide).1

Association for Computational Linguistics, June 5, 2019.

How will the mix of occupations and skills needed across a company’s workforce be transformed 
by generative AI and other artificial intelligence over the coming years? How will a company enable 
these transitions in its hiring plans, retraining programs, and other aspects of human resources?

Do companies have a role to play in ensuring the technology is not deployed in “negative use cases” 
that could harm society? 

How can businesses transparently share their experiences with scaling the use of generative AI 
within and across industries—and also with governments and society? 

The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

29

Policy makers
What will the future of work look like at the level of an economy in terms of occupations and skills? 
What does this mean for workforce planning?

How can workers be supported as their activities shift over time? What retraining programs can be put 
in place? What incentives are needed to support private companies as they invest in human capital? 
Are there earn-while-you-learn programs such as apprenticeships that could enable people to retrain 
while continuing to support themselves and their families?

What steps can policy makers take to prevent generative AI from being used in ways that harm society 
or vulnerable populations? 

Can new policies be developed and existing policies amended to ensure human-centric AI 
development and deployment that includes human oversight and diverse perspectives and accounts 
for societal values? 

Individuals as workers, consumers, and citizens
How concerned should individuals be about the advent of generative AI? While companies can assess 
how the technology will affect their bottom lines, where can citizens turn for accurate, unbiased 
information about how it will affect their lives and livelihoods? 

How can individuals as workers and consumers balance the conveniences generative AI delivers with 
its impact in their workplaces? 

Can citizens have a voice in the decisions that will shape the deployment and integration of generative 
AI into the fabric of their lives? 

Technological innovation can inspire equal parts awe and concern. When that innovation seems 
to materialize fully formed and becomes widespread seemingly overnight, both responses can 
be amplified. The arrival of generative AI in the fall of 2022 was the most recent example of this 
phenomenon, due to its unexpectedly rapid adoption as well as the ensuing scramble among 
companies and consumers to deploy, integrate, and play with it. 

All of us are at the beginning of a journey to understand this technology’s power, reach, and 
capabilities. If the past eight months are any guide, the next several years will take us on a roller-
coaster ride featuring fast-paced innovation and technological breakthroughs that force us to 
recalibrate our understanding of AI’s impact on our work and our lives. It is important to properly 
understand this phenomenon and anticipate its impact. Given the speed of generative AI’s deployment 
so far, the need to accelerate digital transformation and reskill labor forces is great. 

These tools have the potential to create enormous value for the global economy at a time when it is 
pondering the huge costs of adapting to and mitigating climate change. At the same time, they also 
have the potential to be more destabilizing than previous generations of artificial intelligence. They are 
capable of that most human of abilities, language, which is a fundamental requirement of most work 
activities linked to expertise and knowledge as well as a skill that can be used to hurt feelings, create 
misunderstandings, obscure truth, and incite violence and even wars. 

We hope this research has contributed to a better understanding of generative AI’s capacity to 
add value to company operations and fuel economic growth and prosperity as well as its potential 
to dramatically transform how we work and our purpose in society. Companies, policy makers, 
consumers, and citizens can work together to ensure that generative AI delivers on its promise to 
create significant value while limiting its potential to upset lives and livelihoods. The time to act is now.16

Generative AI (gen AI) has taken the world 
by storm, altering our understanding of the 
possible. Creating next-era fashion collections 
in a few clicks, engaging customers with hyper-
personalized offerings, and collapsing years of 
tedious drug discovery work into a few months—
suddenly, all that and more seems within reach. 
As in the early days of breakthroughs like 
blockchain and the Internet itself, gen AI has 
sparked a debate between those who believe 
the technology will reshape the way we work and 
live and those who see gen AI as the next NFT 
moment, soaring briefly and failing to deliver on 
its promise, as nonfungible tokens did earlier in 
this decade. 

So how much of today’s excitement about gen AI 
reflects reality, and how much is myth? McKinsey 
estimates that the technology will open a new era 
of productivity and growth that could create $2.6 
billion to $4.4 trillion of additional value.¹ In the 
telecom space alone, the impact of new gen AI 
use cases is expected to be in the range of $60 
billion to $100 billion. 

For CEOs seeking to unlock this upside, the key 
is to understand how this value will materialize 
and over what period, as well as where to invest 
their resources. There are no right answers, at 
least not yet. We are still in the technology’s 
post-awareness, pre-deployment phase, with 
most software engineers having only recently 
gained access to gen AI tools. But based on our 
experience working with clients over the past 15 
months, we find that CEOs can better formulate 
a strategy if they consider six essential questions 
about gen AI:

1. 

Is the opportunity significantly larger than AI?

2.  Are we ambitious enough with gen AI?

3.  Where is the money in the value chain?

4.  Do we have the right talent in place?

5.  What does it take to cross the “Death Valley” 

of scaling AI?

6.  Are we thinking about risk in the right way?

Is the opportunity significantly 
larger than AI?
Over the past year, many of our client 
conversations and technology deployments have 
focused on gen AI. Despite its novelty, however, 
gen AI does not exist in a silo. Instead, it is simply 
the newest, if most powerful, iteration in the 
unfolding story of how artificial intelligence can 
boost productivity and innovation. We estimate 
that gen AI accounts for only 20 to 40 percent 
of AI’s total value creation potential, with the 
remainder coming from traditional, or “analytical,” 
AI applications, which have heretofore been less 
than fully deployed.

What’s more, other important technology trends, 
such as Web 3.0 and augmented reality and 
virtual reality (AR/VR), are continuing to make 
progress in the shadow of gen AI. They will 
eventually get a strong footing over the next 
decade, with clear value creation potential for 
organizations. Hence, executives rethinking 
industries and business models should view the 
opportunity more broadly than gen AI or even 
all AI. A more effective approach is to consider 
how their organizations can capitalize on the 
confluence of emerging technology trends—a 
truly watershed moment akin to the simultaneous 
emergence of the first cloud, social network, and 
smartphone applications in 2017.

Are we ambitious enough with  
gen AI?
Gen AI has fascinated the world with jaw-
dropping applications like ChatGPT and Pi, 
highlighting AI’s transformative potential. 
Never before has technology pushed the art

of the possible so far ahead and so fast for non-
technologists. As companies rush toward this 
technology, they are likelier to succeed if they solve 
for value creation versus simply checking the box. 
This is particularly concerning in the telco space, 
where players have often expressed interest in 
exploring incremental productivity applications and 
less frequently turn their attention to reimagining 
their businesses through the lens of AI. 

Beyond simply avoiding a rehashed discussion 
of tech versus telco and scaling use cases, senior 
executives can benefit from asking a weightier 
question: How do we reinvent our industry and 
business model by leveraging the disintermediation, 
radical cost curve shifts, and organic consumer 
acquisition opportunities that gen AI can provide? 
Moreover, the age of new platforms opens new 
opportunities, including the creation from scratch of 
hyperscalers or unicorn super apps. One only needs 
to consider the opportunity associated with natural-
language virtual assistants and the disruption this 
could have on the current business context, from 
consumption to business model. Gen AI will reward 
the bold. Already, some 80 percent of today’s 
most popular gen AI products come from new 
entrants,² with incumbents forced to play catch-up 
or otherwise find their edge to lead. 

Where is the money in the value chain?
Gen AI is creating a frenzy among founders and 
investors, with a seemingly endless number of 
players entering the field. A closer look at leading 
gen AI players reveals a couple of winning plays that 
CEOs might use to separate their organization from 
the pack³ :

 — Differentiate à la the fine-dining chef. The 
ingredients of gen AI applications are not in 
and of themselves a source of competitive 
differentiation. Anyone can license the most 
powerful closed-source models, which 
contribute only about 15 percent of the value of 

gen AI applications. This suggests that the real 
value will be realized by those able to combine 
the best available technology with proprietary 
data. Telco leaders should reexamine their data 
asset portfolios with an eye toward designing 
features like unique consumer and distribution 
journeys, such as an always-on customer care 
assistant fine-tuned to each user profile and 
embedded across user channels. Indeed, this 
is exactly what people seem to be asking 
for: among the top 50 gen AI applications, 
consumers are paying for 90 percent of them, 
revenue per user is three times higher than that 
of other apps, and customer acquisition is mostly 
organic. 

 — Find underserved segments of the value 

chain. Gen AI models and applications get most 
of the attention from investors and organizations, 
but other critical segments of the gen AI value 
chain remain surprisingly underrated. From 
commercializing access to graphical processing 
units (GPUs) to providing data cleaning, 
augmentation, or risk management solutions, 
the opportunities are plentiful. We see this play 
already taking place in the data center space, 
with investors exploring acquisitions to supply an 
accelerating demand for workloads. Fortunately, 
many opportunities still exist for organizations to 
gain first-mover advantages in the gen AI market. 
In fact, in most product categories, the gap 
between the top two players is only two times, 
making it easier for new entrants to establish 
themselves as leaders in the field.

Do we have the right talent in place?
Our research shows that gen AI is expected to 
supercharge automation, affecting up to 60 percent 
of work activities over the next 20 years. This 
impact should not be surprising; a gen AI model can 
analyze in an hour more data than a human can in 
ten lifetimes. But will AI replace us all or turn us into 
automatons? 

2 Olivia Moore, “How are consumers using generative AI?” Andreessen Horowitz, Sept. 13, 2023; By some estimates, gen AI start-ups alone have 
already generated more than $1 billion of software-as-a-service revenue.
3 Ninety percent of these companies are already monetizing their offerings with more than three times the average revenue per user than 
incumbents.

Making the most of the generative AI opportunity: Six questions for CEOs 35

Those concerns seem overwrought, at least for 
now. The fact is, gen AI can deliver only if it is 
combined with exceptional human capital. Despite 
the power of gen AI, middling employees will 
produce middling results. Organizations must 
recruit, retain, and develop truly outstanding talent 
in both the technical and nontechnical spheres. 
With the right people in place, organizations truly 
could be on the verge of a new age of innovation.

What does it take to cross the ‘Death 
Valley’ of scaling AI?
Only one in ten AI use cases have been deployed 
in production,⁴ so gen AI has arrived at a time 
when many leaders are disillusioned with the 
yet-unfulfilled promises of artificial intelligence. 
But AI does not have a technology problem; it 
has a design problem. To be effective, AI models 
require top-down focus, the right tech and 
people capabilities, proper data access, modular 
architecture, and effective change management. 
Only then can disparate AI-driven solutions work 
together continuously to create great customer 
and employee experiences, lower unit costs, 
and allow the organization to move faster than 
ever. Without external intervention or guidance, 
only about 3 percent of gen AI proofs of concept 
eventually scale.

Creating a digitally capable organization involves 
rewiring the way companies operate. This effort 
should be broad, covering six dimensions:

1.  business-led digital road map that aligns the 
senior leadership team on the transformation 
vision, value, and strategy, which is focused on 
business reinvention

2.  talent with the right skills and capabilities to 

execute and innovate in both the technical and 
business sides of the organization, including 
upskilling

3.  operating model that increases the 

organization’s metabolic rate by bringing 
together business and technology 

4.  technology that allows the organization to 

innovate faster and more easily—in particular, 
an IT architecture with a flexible orchestration 
layer

5.  data that is continuously enriched and easy 
to consume across the organization to 
improve customer experiences and business 
performance

6.  adoption and scaling of digital and AI solutions 
to optimize value capture by building new skills 
and leadership characteristics and by tightly 
managing the transformation progress and 
risks 

Are we thinking about risk in the 
right way?
Discussions of gen AI risks are plentiful, but 
experience shows that most of these conversations 
need calibrating to ensure that organizations 
approach risk holistically and pragmatically. 
Current conversations about risk tend to focus 
on either short-term considerations (for example, 
customer experience and protection of intellectual 
property) or long-term, existential ones (whether 
artificial general intelligence will rule the world). 
Not enough focus is placed on intermediate risk, 
such as how companies can maintain the trust 
of their stakeholders in an AI-generated reality 
where seeing is no longer believing. Also, other 
categories of risks are simply not getting the 
attention they deserve. Little is said, for example, 
about organizations’ environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) risk, even though training a gen 
AI model consumes about a million liters of water 
for cooling.

4 “The state of AI in 2022—and a half decade in review,” McKinsey, December 6, 2022.

Making the most of the generative AI opportunity: Six questions for CEOs

36

A more pragmatic perspective would be for CEOs 
to steer their organizations toward accepting risk 
as the reality of doing business with AI (for example, 
hallucination is just a feature of gen AI). Fortunately, 
risks can be managed. Plenty of banks, after all, 
deal with customer credit and other difficult types 
of risk daily and still manage to thrive. To navigate 
these uncharted waters, organizations should set up 
cross-functional teams to cover their specific risk 
concerns (for example, regulatory, ethical, cyber, IP, 
and societal risks), establish ethical principles and 
guidelines for gen AI use, and establish continuous 
monitoring for gen AI systems to address risk 
dynamically.

An honest and thorough examination of these six 
questions can lay the foundation of a comprehensive 
gen AI strategy—one that truly focuses on how 
the technology can transform an organization or 
an entire industry. These conversations will not 
necessarily be easy, which makes it essential 
that they be led by CEOs. Perhaps most of all, it is 
advantageous to think big. A road map, after all, can 
lead to different destinations. Where do you want 
your company to land?

The AI-native telco: Radical 
transformation to thrive in 
turbulent times

Artificial intelligence, when deployed at scale, can help telcos protect 
core revenues and drive margin growth. But capturing this opportunity 
will require a wholly different approach.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is unlocking use cases 
that are transforming industries across a wide 
swath of the world’s economy. From infrastructure 
that “self-heals” to radically reimagined (and 
touchless) customer service and experience; from 
large scale hyperpersonalization to automatically 
created marketing messages and images leveraging 
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT—it is all a reality 
today. These AI solutions can powerfully augment 
and sometimes radically outperform most traditional 
business roles.

The impact from these solutions is becoming 
evident. AI leaders—the top quintile of companies 
that have taken the McKinsey Analytics Quotient 
assessment—have experienced a five-year revenue 
CAGR that is 2.1 times higher than that of peers and 
a total return to shareholders that is 2.5 times larger. 

Given the numerous challenges the telecom industry 
has faced in recent years, such as flagging revenues 
and ROIC, one might expect the industry would have 
already adopted a full transition to this technology. 
Yet, based on our experience with operators 
across the world, telcos have yet to fully embrace 
AI and an AI-focused mindset. Instead, models are 
developed once and not enhanced as the business 
context evolves. Machine learning (ML) is in name 
only, limiting the ability of the system to improve 
from experience. Most regrettably, AI investments 
are often not aligned with top-level management 
priorities; lacking that sponsorship, AI deployments 
stall, investment in technical talent withers, and the 
technology remains immature.

even those working on foundational products, are 
celebrated for the benefits they generate for the 
organization. 

Reaching this state of AI maturity is no easy task, 
but it is certainly within the reach of telcos. Indeed, 
with all the pressures they face, embracing large-
scale deployment of AI and transitioning to being 
AI-native organizations could be key to driving 
growth and renewal. Telcos that are starting to 
recognize this is nonnegotiable are scaling AI 
investments as the business impact generated by 
the technology materializes.

While isolated applications of the technology 
can help individual departments improve, it’s AI 
connected holistically at all levels and departments 
that will be key to protecting core revenue and 
driving margin growth in even the most difficult 
of environments. Imagine the following not-so-
distant scenarios:

 — Customer focused: Sarah, a New Yorker, is 
a high average revenue per user (ARPU) 
customer. Aware that Sarah spends half of 
her phone usage time on fitness apps, the AI 
creates an enticing customized upgrade offer 
that includes a six-month credit applicable 
to her favorite fitness subscription and NYC-
specific perks, such as a ticket to an upcoming 
concert sponsored by the operator. Knowing 
Sarah’s high digital propensity¹, the AI makes 
the offer available to her as a digital-only 
promotion. 

Contrast this disjointed state of affairs with an 
AI-native organization. Here, AI is viewed as a 
core competency that powers decision making 
across all departments and organization layers. 
AI investments are required to enable most 
C-level priorities such as more personalized 
recommendations for customers and faster speed 
of answer in call centers. Top executives serve 
as champions of critical AI initiatives. Data and AI 
capabilities are managed as products, built for 
scalability and reusability. AI product managers, 

 — Employee focused: When Trevor, an associate 
in a telco mall store, logs in at the start of his 
shift, he receives a celebratory notification 
congratulating him on his high-quality 
interactions with customers the previous 
day. And because the AI detected that Trevor 
is underperforming peers in accessory and 
device protection attach rates, he receives a 
notification pointing him to coaching resources 
specifically created to enhance performance in 
those metrics.

The AI-native telco: Radical transformation to thrive in turbulent times

40

 — Infrastructure focused: Lucile, director of a 

capital planning team, uses AI to inform highly 
targeted network investment decisions based 
on a granular understanding of customer-level 
network experience scores strongly correlated to 
commercial outcomes (for example, churn). The 
AI provides tactical recommendations of what 
and where to build based on where customers 
use the network and on automatically computed 
thresholds after which new investments have 
marginal impact on experience and commercial 
outcomes for the operator.

How these possibilities could become reality is critical 
to consider, especially given that most telcos currently 
deploy AI in limited ways that will not drive sustainable, 
at-scale success. 

Why now? The case for becoming  
AI native 
Factors supporting this move for telcos include the 
following: 

 — Increasing accessibility of leading AI technology: 
AI-native organizations like Meta continue to 
grow the open-source ecosystem by making new 
programming languages, datasets, and algorithms 
widely available. In parallel, cloud providers have 
developed multiple quick-to-deploy machine-
learning APIs like Google Cloud’s Natural 
Language API. Generative AI solutions, such as 
ChatGPT, that are capable of creating engaging 
responses to human queries are also accessible 
through API. These two factors, coupled with 
dropping costs of data processing and storage, 
make AI increasingly easier for organizations to 
leverage. 

 — Rapid explosion of usable data: Operators can 
collect, structure, and use significantly more 
data directly than ever before. This information 
includes data flows from individualized app usage 
patterns, site-specific customer experience 
scores, and what can be purchased or shared 
from partners or third parties. To answer privacy 
fears raised by consumers and regulators, telcos 
must also invest in building digital trust, including 
actively managing data privacy and having a 

robust cybersecurity strategy and a framework 
to guide ethical deployment of AI.

 — Proven use cases and outcomes: AI-native 

organizations across industries have deployed AI 
to achieve four critical outcomes highly relevant 
to operators across the world: 1) drive revenue 
protection and growth through personalization, 
2) transform the cost structure, 3) enable a 
frictionless customer experience, and 4) meet 
new workplace demands. Operators can learn 
from all of them. Streaming players, for example, 
have long been known for providing highly 
curated personalized content recommendations 
based on past user behavior. To optimize cost 
and deliver a seamless customer experience, 
one of the leading US insurance companies 
leverages AI assistants to reduce and even 
eliminate human interactions for users to obtain 
coverage or cancel policies with other carriers. 
In turn, some of the leading tech companies in 
the world are known for using AI to highlight the 
traits of great managers and high-performing 
teams and use those insights to train company 
leaders.

 — Technology investments recognized as a 
business driver: In a postpandemic world, 
there is broad consensus among investors and 
executives that technology investments are not 
a mere cost center but a fundamental business 
driver with profound impacts on the bottom 
line. Despite prospects of economic turmoil and 
recessionary fears, IT spending is expected to 
increase by more than 5 percent in 2023, with 
technology leaders under growing pressure to 
demonstrate impact on company financials.² 

 — Operator bets need hypercharging: As networks 
and products converge, operators are making 
bets on becoming cost and efficiency focused, 
experience-centric, or ecosystem players. AI use 
cases that are more relevant for each bet can 
give them a better chance to hypercharge and 
leapfrog competition. 

For the greatest payoff, this shift requires 
telcos to embrace the concept of the AI-native 
organization—a structure where the technology

41

 
is deeply embedded across the fabric of the 
entire enterprise.  

Using AI to reimagine the core business
Telcos have been under relentless pressure 
over the past decade as traditional growth 
drivers eroded and economic value increasingly 
shifted to tech companies. By using AI to its 
fullest extent, operators can protect their core 
business from further erosion while improving 
margins. 

As the industry looks to leverage the power 
of AI, we see six themes gaining prevalence in 
strategic agendas based on our experience 
working with telcos across the world.

Hyperpersonalize and architect sales and 
engagement
Leveraging the breadth and depth of user-
level data at their disposal, operators have 
been increasingly investing in AI-enabled 
personalization and channel steering.

For example, a hyperpersonalized plan and 
device recommendation for each line holder 
could leverage granular behavioral data—such 
as number of and engagement with apps 
installed and device feature usage—to create 
individualized plan recommendations (superior 
network speed or streaming service add-ons), 
promos (“Receive unlimited prepaid data to 
be used for a music streaming service for only 
$5 per month”), and messaging for specific 
devices, locations, and events (“Upgrade 
to the latest device featuring built-in VR”). 
Subsequently, using audience segmentation 
tools, customers can be guided to channels 
that offer an engaging experience while driving 
the most profitable sales outcome for the telco. 
A subscriber, for example, with low-digital 
propensity³, high ARPU, and high churn risk who 
is living within a few miles of a store, might be a 
good candidate to nudge to a device upgrade 
in-store, leading to better customer experience 
and potentially stronger loyalty for the operator. 
Or consider a different scenario: this subscriber 
uses an advanced 5G network in New York 

City and is a regular user of fitness apps who 
travels frequently outside the country. As a 
result, her telco offers a personalized plan 
recommendation with superior network access, 
top fitness app subscription perks, and an 
attractive international data plan. 

Case study: An Asia–Pacific operator that 
launched a comprehensive customer value 
management transformation powered by AI 
(with personalization at the core) achieved a 
more than 10 percent reduction in customer 
churn and a 20 percent uptake in cross-sell.

Reimagine proactive service
Earlier investments in digital infrastructure 
combined with predictive and prescriptive 
AI capabilities enable operators to develop 
a personalized service experience based on 
autonomous resolution and proactive outreach. 

With fully autonomous resolution, for example, 
the system can predict and resolve potential 
sources of customer dissatisfaction before 
they are even encountered. After noticing a 
customer is accruing roaming charges while 
traveling abroad, the AI system automatically 
applies the optimal roaming package to her 
monthly bill to minimize charges. It then follows 
up with a personalized bill explanation detailing 
the package optimization and resulting savings 
for the customer, leading to a surprising and 
positive CX moment.

Operators are also exploring the redesign 
of digital service journeys with the help of 
AI assistants serving as digital concierges. 
Generative AI technologies, including 
tools such as ChatGPT, have the potential 
to enhance existing bots through better 
understanding of more complex customer 
intents, more empathetic conversations, and 
better summarization capabilities (for example, 
when a bot needs to handover a customer 
interaction to a human rep). A single unified 
AI assistant will likely also represent a step 
change in speed, accuracy, and engagement 
compared to the interactive voice response 
systems of today.

An AI-powered service organization is a key 
ingredient to releasing the full capacity of 
specialized reps for high-value interactions while 
improving overall customer experience—one of the 
key battlegrounds for telcos around the world. 

Case study: A leading telco is expected to achieve 
an approximately 10 percent decrease in device 
troubleshooting calls, powered by a proactive AI 
engine that considers the customer’s likelihood 
of calling and issue severity to decide whether to 
push the most effective resolution via SMS. This 
proactive engine is also a key element of the 
operator’s ambition to have the highest customer 
satisfaction scores among competitors.

Build the store of the future
In retail, AI is leading a revolution in the design and 
running of stores by streamlining operations and 
elevating the consumer experience. 

Some telcos already use virtual retail assistants 
displayed on floor screens to conduct multiple 
transactions with customers, including adding 
balance to a prepaid account and selling prepaid 
cards and TV subscriptions. A leading European 
telco leverages AI tools for delivering more-
accurate device grading and trade-ins in the store.

The store of the near future includes the following 
components:

 — Front of house: Aisle layout and product 

placement are optimized based on browsing 
patterns analyzed by machine vision. Digital 
signage is made relevant to individual customers 
who are in-store and identified through 
biometric or geofencing technology. Interactive 
kiosks serve up personalized promos, service 
assistance, and wait-time forecasts. Customers 
are matched with reps who are given nudges 
with personalized info likely to spark the 
best interaction and lead to a truly seamless 
customer experience.

 — Back of house: Device SKUs are automatically 

managed to optimize inventory and sales. Stores 
stock curated assortments based on local 
preferences surfaced in sales analytics. AI tools 
such as computer-vision-based grading allows 

for immediate price guarantees on devices that 
are traded in.

 — Outside: Consumers walking near the store 
receive text or push notifications with a 
personalized promotion and an invitation to 
check the product in-store.

Case study: An Asian telco launched a 5G virtual 
retail assistant in unmanned pop-up stores. The 
digital human communicates with customers 
in a personal and friendly way with engaging 
facial expressions and body language. She 
supports customers across multiple transactions, 
from buying prepaid cards to getting SIM card 
replacements.

Deploy a self-healing, self-optimizing network
The AI-native telco will leverage technology to 
optimize decision making across the network 
life cycle stages, from planning and building 
to running and operating. In the planning and 
building stages, for example, AI can be used to 
prioritize site-level capacity investments based 
on granular data, such as customer-level network 
experience scores.

In the running and operating phases, AI can 
prioritize the dispatching of emergency crews 
based on potential revenue loss or impact on 
customer experience. AI can also enable a self-
healing network, which automatically fixes faults—
for example, auto-switching customers from one 
carrier frequency to another because the former 
was expected to become clogged. This frees up 
engineering resources for higher-value-added 
activities. 

Case study: A telecom operator developed an 
AI-based customer network experience “score” 
to improve its understanding of how customers 
perceive their network and to inform network 
deployment decisions. The AI engine leveraged 
granular network-level information for every 
line (e.g., signal strength, throughput) with an 
ML model to create the score tailored to each 
customer’s individual network experience and 
expectations. The operator used the score, which 
directly correlated with impact metrics such 
as customer churn or network care tickets, to

monitor network performance trending (how the 
score fluctuated in different regions), to identify 
opportunities to refine its buildout plan, and to 
improve how it managed its customer base.

Improve frontline productivity
The AI-native telco also uses AI-enabled tools 
to optimize workforce planning and coaching 
of frontline employees across multiple teams, 
including field force, customer service, and retail 
associates.

For workforce planning, AI tools enhance 
traditional applications by forecasting across 
supply-and-demand metrics for monthly, daily, and 
intraday time horizons with higher accuracy, more 
granularity, and full automation. Smart scheduling 
matches supply with demand, such as reps needed 
in a call center during particularly busy periods, to 
meet service-level targets as well as customers’ 
expectations.

Acting as an intelligent coaching manager, an 
AI-enabled nudge engine provides personalized 
celebratory and improvement opportunity nudges 
to employees and their supervisors (Exhibit 1). 
Coupled with advancements in generative AI, the 
impact of the AI nudge engine might go even 

further by, for example, simulating customer 
responses under different scenarios to train reps.

Case study: A telco operator deployed an 
AI-enabled scheduling and coaching solution for 
technicians servicing copper and fiber customers. 
Resulting efficiency gains included 10 to 20 
percent capacity generation and improved 
customer satisfaction scores.

Power intelligent internal operations
AI-powered insights will enhance decision 
making across business functions, beyond the 
automation of standardized or low-complexity 
tasks. In finance, for example, AI can flag outlier 
invoices for further inspection, while on the 
accounts receivable side it can predict customers 
likely to default, triggering mitigating actions. 
In HR, AI can help flag employees with high 
attrition or absenteeism risk and the respective 
drivers while also helping identify informal 
influencers who can lead change management 
efforts. Generative AI solutions can help with 
the development of product marketing copy, the 
synthesis of customer feedback for research 
purposes or even enable business users to write 
simple code to quickly adjust IT applications.

Overall, involving AI in decision making 
and execution results in higher speed and 
consistency. Its benefits can be felt everywhere, 
from contract management and supplier search 
to onboarding and IT maintenance.

Case study: A UK-based transportation company 
deployed AI to identify the main drivers of 
employee attrition and absenteeism. The 
company then developed targeted interventions 
for each of the drivers with an estimated 20 to 25 
percent reduction in sick pay and attrition costs.

Success factors of AI-native 
transformation
The what of envisioning being AI native is the 
relatively easier part of this journey; the how of 
making the possibilities reality is the tougher 
challenge. Working on multiyear projects with 
operators across the world, we’ve identified 
critical best practices in three areas that 
are the hallmarks of a successful AI-native 

transformation: building AI, managing it, and 
driving its adoption. 

Building AI best practices
Developing transformative AI requires a  
carefully calibrated approach that follows 
these core guidelines:

 — Build core AI capabilities in a modular 

fashion and with reusability in mind, with 
the potential to be deployed across 
multiple contexts in the operator. A core 
forecasting engine, for instance, can be 
deployed both in a call center and in a retail 
setting. This will drive higher ROI for AI 
investments by decreasing time to deploy 
and preventing duplication of work. 

 — Tightly integrate AI capabilities with one 
another based on a model architecture 
approach that interconnects different AI 
models to maximize value generation and 
promote reusability. For example, a digital

speeds up time to market of AI use cases.

How do digital twins affect the deployment of AI?

From:
every use case curating data for its own needs

To:
one-time curating effort that is leveraged by all use cases

Traditional analytics and AI
Use cases that translate data into insights

Next-generation AI use cases
Applied models that drive actionable

Simulation and core models
Behavioral analytics and ‘what-if’

Data consumers tap directly into the data platform,
creating use-case-specific data assets.
This is reactive and inefficient.

Digital twins meet multiple use cases’ needs
and are constantly evolved. This drives reuse 
and ensures alignment to value creation.

propensity model will be built as a core model 
that becomes an input into multiple customer-
facing models.

 — Use digital twins as the foundation for all AI. 
Digital twins—virtual representations of a 
physical asset, person, or process with a data 
product at its core—are the key to unlocking 
reusable AI. The data in a digital twin is 
intentionally structured and modeled to enable 
easy, reusable consumption and governance 
across needs, and to serve as the single source 
of truth for all models (Exhibit 2). 

 — Treat AI capabilities as true products by 
assigning dedicated product managers 
to oversee them. PMs act as translators 
between the technical and business teams 
and are mandated to own the product 
continuously and develop opportunities to 
improve it. They ensure that it’s never built as 
a onetime solution.

 — Set up AI labs for fast experimentation. 

Dedicated teams of PMs and data scientists 
or engineers are granted expedited approval 
to experiment with new models, test for 
feasibility, and validate business value before 
scaling.

 — Implement machine learning operations 

(MLOps) best practices to shorten the analytics 
development life cycle and increase model 
stability. MLOps typically involve automating 
the integration and deployment of code 
underlying AI capabilities.

 — Refresh the AI tech stack at least annually 
to take advantage of new developments. In 
recent years, there have been significant 
enhancements in tooling that drastically 
transformed AI workflows.

 — Rethink the tech talent strategy holistically. 
Without a deep bench of engineering talent, 
an AI-native ambition will remain a mirage. 
Employers should consider expanding their 
sourcing net to a wider range of universities 
and learning environments. It’s also critical to 
improve conditions that developers work under, 
because developer experience is a top factor 
in determining an employer’s attractiveness.⁴  
Constraints on which programming languages 
and cloud providers’ tools can be used, for 
example, can have meaningful impact on a 
developer’s decision to recruit for and stay with 
an organization, as well as on the developer’s 
productivity. Because tech talent needs 
are multifaceted, operators should launch a 
comprehensive list of initiatives across the 
employee life cycle.

Managing AI best practices
Maintaining and improving AI capabilities depends 
on an experimental, iterative mindset focused 
squarely on product and tech innovation. 

 — Speed up IT and data modernization efforts 

(the complexity of which often slows down 
AI transformations) by leveraging reference 
architectures that have been road-tested in 
multiple transformations across industries. 
Moreover, build the target cloud-native data 
architecture following an iterative approach, 
focused on enhancing the components 
required for the priority AI use cases first 
(for example, data streaming might be key to 
unlock fraud detection use cases). 

Driving AI adoption best practices
Taking a comprehensive approach focused on 
both what goes into and comes out of models is 
critical for fostering growing usage of AI: 

 — Ensure AI solutions are considered 

trustworthy AI, including dimensions such 
as model explainability, accountability for 
the outcomes of AI models, and technical 
robustness.

 — Make change management a day one focus. 
Operators need to involve end users of 
AI-enabled insights through all the stages of 
the model development life cycle and invest 
in formal and informal capability building. 
Operators will also need to take a hard look at 
replacing and revamping existing processes 
as well as management practices and roles to 
be centered around AI.

Next steps toward building the 
AI-native telco
In many industries, companies have used AI 
to make their operations more efficient, drive 
material enhancements in customer experience, 
and ultimately used it to bring innovative 
products and services to market more quickly. 
Operators can learn from these industries and 
invest in AI to improve their competitiveness in 
the coming years of economic uncertainty and 
competitive turmoil. Many operators have already 
started to do so.

Organizations that talk about adopting AI but 
move at a slow pace, hoping that a few innovation 
projects developed at the fringes of the 
organization and in silos that will come together 
to create a snowball effect to holistically change 
how technology informs business decision 
making, are likely to fail. 

Ultimately, the biggest drivers of AI adoption 
will be CEO-level sponsorship and full 
executive alignment throughout the AI-native 
transformation. The art of the possible with 
the technology has long surpassed what 
companies have been able to absorb. Without 
active support from the top level to proactively 
address organizational inertia, communicate 
an engaging change story, model new 
behavior, promote capability building, and 
make commitments on the required long-
term technological investments, AI-native 
transformation efforts will not succeed. 

The journey to becoming AI native will require 
operators to create a strategic vision and road 
map that excites and mobilizes the organization, 
build priority AI capabilities to gain momentum, 
and bring everyone together to ensure 
operating model and change management are 
set up to drive adoption. Embracing large-scale 
AI deployment across the organization will 
follow.

The journey is long and requires commitment, 
but operators that embrace the path to 
becoming AI native are more likely to emerge as 
leaders in the next horizon of transformation.

How generative AI could 
revitalize profitability for telcos 

The new technology offers the sector a real opportunity to reverse its stagnant  
fortunes. But seizing it will require embracing innovation and agility to an  
unprecedented degree.

Vieira, representing views from McKinsey’s Technology, Media & Telecommunications Practice.

Amid the intense competition and cost-cutting 
confronting telcos, early evidence suggests that 
generative AI (gen AI) could be the catalyst to 
reignite growth after a decade of stagnation. But 
will it be a groundbreaking differentiator or simply 
table stakes? 

Already the technology is on track to become 
a new norm in the industry. Most telco leaders 
we surveyed1 say they are developing gen AI 
solutions that range from pilots to full-scale 
deployments, and leading telcos such as AT&T, 
SK Telecom, and Vodafone have made much-
publicized early gen AI commitments and 
launched trials. Some telcos around the world 
have started to experience significant double-
digit percentage impact from this technology. 
One European telco recently increased 
conversion rates for marketing campaigns by 
40 percent while reducing costs by using gen AI 
to personalize content. A Latin American telco 
increased call center agent productivity by 25 
percent and improved the quality of its customer 
experience by enhancing agent skills and 
knowledge with gen-AI-driven recommendations. 

Most impressive is that these telcos deployed the 
models in just weeks—the first went live in two 
weeks, and the second in five. For an industry 
with a mixed track record for capitalizing on 
new technologies and legacy systems that slow 
innovation, these early results and deployment 
times illustrate the potentially transformative 
power of gen AI. 

These aren’t one-offs. Pretrained models that 
can be fine-tuned in days for use cases are 
readily available, enabling organizations to 
bring proofs-of-concept to life with minimal 
up-front investment, achieve impact out of the 
gate, and scale their efforts. Our experience 
working with clients indicates the potential for 
telcos to achieve significant EBITDA impact 
with gen AI. In some cases, estimates indicate 
returns on incremental margins increasing 3 to 
4 percentage points in two years, and as much 
as 8 to 10 percentage points in five years, by 

enhancing customer revenue through improved 
customer life cycle management and decisively 
reducing costs across all domains.

However, while nearly all of the 130 telcos we 
surveyed are doing something with gen AI, our 
survey findings suggest a palpable sense of 
caution and skepticism in the industry. More 
than 85 percent of the executives surveyed 
are cautious to attribute more than 20 percent 
revenue or cost savings impact by domain, 
with the greatest enthusiasm for a radical 
transformation in customer service (Exhibit 1). 

This blend of optimism and restraint highlights 
the critical juncture the industry faces. Seizing 
the gen AI opportunity to differentiate services 
and achieve sustainable growth will require 
the hidebound industry to embrace innovation, 
exploration, and agility at an unprecedented level 
and move from decoupled AI efforts to a holistic, 
AI-native telco.2  

The chance for telcos to make this change has 
never been more accessible. The industry has 
struggled these last ten-plus years to achieve the 
potential of “traditional” AI, given the complexity 
and legacy processes involved. In addition to 
the significant impact gen AI can bring to bear 
with entirely new use cases and applications, 
its ability to learn from vast amounts of diverse 
data and interact in near-human-like ways may 
be the tipping point for accelerating broader AI 
programs and the building blocks that enable 
them, fueling company-wide transformations. 

Furthermore, the imperative for such change has 
never been greater. Because gen AI democratizes 
access to powerful capabilities, any telco—a 
small operator or large incumbent—can reshape 
customer expectations and its organizational 
efficiency. In doing so, they can potentially narrow 
previously unassailable competitive advantages 
and overturn long-standing barriers to growth. 
Those at the forefront of this movement stand to 
position themselves to regain growth faster and 
capture a more significant share of the nearly

That is in addition to the $140 billion to $180 
billion in productivity gains that gen AI will 
create in the industry above what could be

How can telco leaders use the technology 
to drive AI transformations and unlock new 
value? What challenges do they face? And 
what will it take to succeed? This article offers 
insights into these critical questions, drawing 
extensively from our research, industry survey, 
and firsthand experience implementing these 
technologies.

Gen AI today in the telco industry
Gen AI represents the latest advance in AI, and 
it may arguably be one of the most important. 
The technology’s ability to analyze more and 
different types of data such as code, images, 
and text, and to create new content, enables 
new levels of personalization, performance, 
and customer engagement. With today’s 
capabilities, many use cases are already 
possible across network operations, customer 
service, marketing and sales, IT, and support 
functions.

These use cases can both enhance existing AI  
capabilities (through the inclusion of new 
unstructured data sources) and provide new sources 
of value (through gen AI and in combination with 
traditional AI solutions) to deliver significant impact 
across all key domains. Customer service and 
marketing and sales currently make up the largest 
share of total impact (Exhibit 3).  

Examples of such use cases based on early pilots 
include the following:  

 — In customer service, where the technology can 
vastly improve customer experience, increase 
agent productivity, and enable fully digital 
interactions. A Latin American telco is enhancing 
its customer service AI chatbots to improve agent 
support, a move it anticipates will reduce costs by 
15 to 20 percent. The telco also is using gen AI to 
summarize voice and written client interactions 
in nearly a dozen use cases, with the expectation 
that it can reduce associated costs by up to 80 
percent.

 — In marketing and sales, where gen AI enables 

hyperpersonalization, deeper customer insights, 
and faster content generation. A European telco 
is using the technology to identify new sales 
leads from customer calls, with its pilot project 
achieving a more than 10 percent conversion rate. 
The company can now also create personalized 
messages and visual media to target individual 
customer microsegments. To do this, the telco 
feeds a gen AI model standard marketing 
messages, customer data (including household 
details, type of phone they use, and where they 
live), and cognitive biases (for example, whether 
the customer would be more receptive to 
messaging that evokes scarcity, such as a limited-
time offer, or emphasizes authority, such as 
endorsements, awards, and industry experience). 

 — In network operations, where gen AI can optimize 

technology configurations, enhance labor 
productivity, extract customer insights from 
social media, and improve inventory and network 
planning and management through the ability to

mine unstructured data. One large telco is 
using the technology to accelerate network 
mapping by analyzing and structuring data 
about network components, including 
specifications and maintenance information, 
from supplier contracts. This will enable the 
telco to more accurately assess component 
compatibility, maintenance requirements, 
and more—an effort anticipated to improve 
operational planning and optimize capital 
productivity. 

 — In IT, where the technology can accelerate 

software migrations and development. Gen AI 
offers telcos a path to reduce their mounting 
technical debt and enable capabilities 
previously deferred because of time and 

resource constraints.  Organizations are 
applying gen AI to streamline the entire 
software life cycle, from documenting how 
a new product, feature, or service will be 
perceived by end users to generating and 
scanning code for vulnerabilities before 
launch. One McKinsey study found that 
software developers can complete coding 
tasks up to twice as fast with gen AI.3

 — In support functions, where gen AI will 
reduce the costs associated with back-
office operations and improve employee 
productivity. A European telco uses the 
technology in a number of ways, including: 
shortening procurement analysis and 
negotiation strategy insights from weeks

encounter difficulties in justifying use cases—a 
clear signal that much of the push has come from 
the bottom, not the top, and that more work is 
needed to elevate gen AI to a CEO-led priority. 
Moreover, finding appropriate talent and obtaining 
quality data remain significant challenges for telcos, 
although confidence about solving these rose 
among surveyed leaders this year as compared  
to last.

New sources of value may also emerge from turning 
internal uses cases into new products for their 
customers. For example, a customer care solution 
may be offered on demand to small business 
customers seeking ways to improve their own call 
center’s productivity and service.

Telco leaders’ view ahead: Real change 
and real challenges  
In the wake of their initial successes, business 
leaders we surveyed say they plan to maintain 
or double their budgets for gen AI in the next 
year and invest in more than 50 dedicated full-
time employees to pursue their gen AI ambitions 
effectively. More than half are already scaling up 
use cases.

Moreover, survey findings indicate that the 
technology also had a knock-on effect across all AI 
initiatives. Compared to responses from McKinsey’s 
2022 digital twin survey, we see a 30-percentage-
point increase in business leaders who want to 
invest in and focus more on data and analytics. 

However, despite the magnitude of the opportunity 
and the level of interest (and need), our survey 
found few who follow the kind of holistic approach 
required to succeed at scale. Only about one-third 
of telco leaders said they have a capability-building 
plan for employees on gen AI or are investing in 
change management efforts—two core building 
blocks for building a culture of innovation and the 
test-and-learn mindset. A similar share said gen AI 
has yet to be treated as an organizational priority, 
and that proponents of the technology often 

 Finally, the survey findings suggest that gen AI has 
already begun to influence long-standing market 
dynamics. While European telecom operators 
have traditionally lagged in AI and technology 
transformations, survey findings indicate that 
they are pulling ahead of those in North America 
in their adoption of gen AI, especially in areas 
such as network operations (71 percent compared 
to 58 percent) and IT (67 percent compared to 
55 percent). This shift may be a result of greater 
maturity in managing data privacy. Small and 
large operators report similar views on where to 
prioritize, focusing on customer service and IT in 
similar measure, suggesting the possibility of new 
competitive pressures emerging for incumbents 
(Exhibit 4).

The building blocks for a successful 
gen AI journey 
In order to achieve the above-mentioned impact, 
organizations will need to move away from the 
labyrinth of proofs-of-concept and scale the 
technology. As with any digital or AI initiative, we 
find there are no shortcuts in doing this. The same 
core building blocks are necessary, namely (1) a 
business-led roadmap, (2) the right talent, (3) an 
operating model for scale, (4) technology built 
for speed and innovation, (5) quality data that is 
easily accessible and managed in a responsible 
and accountable way, and (6) change management 
to ensure adoption and scaling.4 These are 
fundamental pillars in effectively scaling use cases 
and capturing sustainable impact from gen AI in the 
journey toward an AI-native telco.

However, while the same holistic approach is 
required, gen AI’s unique capabilities—its ability 
to surface new insights from seemingly unrelated 
data, its reliance on large language models from 
third-party vendors, and its transformative impact 
on roles and work—present new challenges that 
will require greater agility and additional oversight. 
Next, we outline key differences and provide 
recommendations on how telcos can best  
tackle them.

Strategy: Determine when to build, buy, or fine-
tune solutions
As with any AI initiative, leaders will need to align 
on vision, value, and road map, assessing both 
risks and opportunities, and communicating 
guidelines for use across the organization. In 
building a road map, telco leaders will face a 
choice: use a commercial, off-the-shelf solution 
if one exists, fine-tune existing large language 
models with internal data, or build and train a new 

foundation model from scratch (what we refer to 
as the “taker,” “shaper,” and “maker” approach, 
respectively). 

Each is suitable for different use cases and has 
its own costs, requiring leaders to develop not 
only a clear vision and strategy for which use 
cases to pursue, but also how. One mistake we 
see some telcos making is building common gen 
AI solutions from scratch—a content generator or 
call summarization solution for example—when 
there are nearly a dozen out-of-the-box options 
on the market today from gen AI start-ups or 
SaaS vendors injecting gen AI capabilities into 
existing solutions. Only one-third of surveyed 
telco leaders say they buy products off the shelf, 
suggesting that many telcos continue to embrace 
a do-it-yourself model. This move is likely to 
slow innovation and distract talent from more 
differentiating use cases, as it has in the past with 
other technologies.

54

Instead, leaders should strongly consider 
partnering with gen AI solution providers and 
enterprise software vendors for solutions that 
aren’t very complex or telco specific. This is 
particularly critical in instances where any delays 
in implementation will put them at a disadvantage 
against competitors already leveraging these 
services. The handful of solutions leaders can 
concentrate on shaping or making themselves 
should enable them to differentiate their offerings 
or address a strategic business priority, such as 
delivering the best service or network coverage, 
and drive sustained economic impact. To do 
this, one CIO at a large telco is bringing together 
business leaders across all key domains to assess 
hundreds of potential use cases and build a road 
map for determining when to build, buy, or fine-
tune models, and for prioritizing resources and 
building momentum with early successes.

Capturing the full potential will also require 
significant upskilling of existing staff—everyone 
from data scientists to business leaders—on gen 
AI, including the risks of uploading proprietary 
data into third-party language models. Some 
telcos are setting up internal certification and 
university-led training programs to ensure their 
teams have the right skills and capabilities to 
innovate and execute with the technology. For 
instance, a large telco created a badging system 
to identify gen-AI-ready employees who have 
completed the company’s sessions on use, risk, 
and effective prompting techniques given by its 
AI, legal, and risk experts. Following certification, 
users participate in weekly discussion groups 
to stay abreast of changes and discuss their 
successes and challenges. McKinsey research 
has found that such efforts improve the quality of 
prompts.  

Talent: Upskill and expand internal expertise to 
innovate with gen AI
The speed of innovation that is now possible with 
gen AI puts new pressure on telcos accustomed 
to outsourcing tech talent to build in-house 
AI expertise. Consider the experiences of two 
telcos—one that continued offshoring and 
outsourcing tech talent and one that created 
a dedicated AI team of ten data scientists and 
engineers. In the time the first telco took to draft 
requirements for outsourcing gen AI use-case 
development, the second built and deployed four 
gen AI solutions.  

While this new technology democratizes AI by 
requiring fewer highly specialized data scientists 
to build the models, it requires new skills, such as 
gen AI prompt engineering, which may sometimes 
be a separate skill embedded within traditional 
roles. It also requires significantly more data 
engineers and subject matter experts who 
understand what data to collect and how, and 
who can oversee daily quality reviews as new 
forms of data are generated and consumed by 
these systems, including user queries, responses, 
and feedback.

Operating model: Orchestrate efforts 
enterprise-wide
A significant portion of implemented gen AI 
solutions can be adapted and reused in multiple 
use cases. A gen AI chatbot developed to 
improve agent productivity, for example, can be 
repurposed with additional fine-tuning or data 
to answer frequently asked questions by new 
employees or provide IT support. An off-the-shelf 
content generation system for drafting sales 
proposals may also streamline the development 
of marketing and business plans. 

As a result, we’re beginning to see telcos adopt 
more centralized decision making around gen 
AI development. This shift includes a greater 
emphasis on adopting reusable services and self-
service components, an evolution of key functions, 
such as risk, FinOps, and transformation offices, 
to be more focused on gen AI, and the creation 
of “control towers” that can oversee all gen AI 
investments and development efforts. In practice, 
that can mean, for example, prioritizing the 
use-case pipeline, identifying opportunities for 
reusability, setting key performance indicators to 
measure and track impact at the level of both use

case and enterprise, and managing suppliers and 
risk. A European telco’s control tower evaluates 
the effects of its gen AI transformation based on 
three dimensions—financial impact, user adoption, 
and model performance—and aggregates the 
data in dashboards that enable the company’s 
top executives to keep tabs on the organization’s 
progress. Similarly, a Latin American telco uses 
a control tower to consolidate and standardize 
supplier contracts, tracking key metrics such as 
scope, duration, and renewal to compare providers 
more easily, identify potential redundancies, and 
reduce the manual work of digitizing content. 

Technology: Create a blueprint for reusability, 
innovation, and excellence 
Organizations will also need a technology blueprint 
that enables reusability. For instance, the blueprint 
should include a framework for determining 
which large language models to use and when 
(commercial or open-source models, for example, 
or those that support hybrid workloads). And it 
should lay out how to scale a pilot—for example, 
to extend a pilot that serves 100 call agents to 
serve more than 10,000 agents with the same 
latency and cost profile. The blueprint should 
also have a framework for determining which 
gen AI capabilities can be turned into ready-to-
use modules to be plugged into different use 
cases. One large telco, for example, has begun 
to identify and develop components designed 
to fetch product data from a large dataset and 
generate content from it that could be reused 
by data science teams across domains such as 
customer service, network operations, and sales 
and marketing.

With new gen AI research and capabilities 
being announced weekly and sometimes daily, 
technology teams will also need a dedicated 
gen AI innovation lab to keep abreast of industry 
changes and test emerging solutions. For example, 
one large telco’s chief data and analytics officer 
recruited PhD graduates from universities to staff 
a gen AI innovation lab and build bespoke solutions 
ahead of the market to gain a competitive edge.

Once new models are deployed, telcos will need 
to monitor model outputs daily to ensure quality 
and accuracy do not waver as models learn and 
adapt their responses based on user queries 
and feedback. Large language model operations 
(LLMOps) is an emerging practice that aims to 
streamline the daily management and monitoring 
of gen AI models. A key component of LLMOps is a 
dedicated operations team to oversee all deployed 
gen AI models, continuously monitoring for issues 
and rapidly adapting solutions when needed, just 
as a network operations team might do for network 
performance. Organizations can start small 
now and build capability in this area as the field 
of LLMOps develops. For example, a European 
telco started by assigning three data scientists to 
monitor its handful of deployed models and plans 
to expand the team as more models are deployed.

Data: Capture everything, especially 
unstructured data, and ensure responsible use
One of gen AI’s superpowers is its ability to 
uncover connections in seemingly unrelated 
datasets, which has implications for how 
organizations choose to collect and measure data, 
and how they manage it to ensure responsible use.

Data collection: Telcos will need to think more 
broadly about data collection, mapping more 
data, setting up pipelines for unstructured data, 
and creating synthetic data to evaluate outputs. 
A US telco, for instance, has reached beyond 
its traditional datasets in its work to develop a 
customer service agent copilot that will reduce 
average resolution times by 40 percent across 
more than one million annual chats. As part of 
their work, the company’s data scientists gather 
institutional knowledge from agent emails and 
interactions to enable the chatbot to learn from 
real situations and challenges, and offer detailed 
descriptions of how to resolve specific issues. 
The team also creates synthetic data using a 
large language model to create sample customer 
questions and answers, with agents reviewing the 
outputs for accuracy.

56

Responsible use: These types of more 
sophisticated data strategies and tactics come 
with new regulatory, intellectual property, and 
data privacy concerns. Risks abound in this 
new era, particularly with customer insights, 
recommendations, and network optimizations 
being analyzed and generated by third-party 
large language models and open-source 
environments. To address the novel risks, telcos 
need to expand their data governance programs 
to address unstructured data. For example, one 
multinational telco hardware provider created 
a robust data access process to validate what 
data can be used in gen AI use cases. Data 
owners along with legal and security experts 
work together to validate each use case based 
on several criteria including the criticality of the 
data to the business (data that is deemed of high 
importance cannot be input into commercial large 
language models); the end users (some users 
cannot access certain data assets); and the risks 
if the gen AI solution gives an incorrect answer. 
The team manages the process in an agile manner 
using a simple Microsoft Power App to manage 
and automate the workflow across teams, and 
conducts monthly forums to review the process 
and develop improvements. The organization has 
reviewed more than 200 use cases, rejecting a 
number due to intellectual property and other 
risks, to ensure responsible use for the company.

Change management: Ensure adoption and 
scaling are CEO-led 
Every role, including everyone from network 
technicians to HR professionals, will be impacted 
by gen AI, making vital the need for leaders to 
begin preparing their employees now to capture 
the full value of this transformative technology. 
With many employees already using the 
technology in their personal lives, organizations 
will need to consider how to help them learn to 
apply the technology in a professional context, 
upskilling and reskilling staff at scale. Such 
work can be made easier using gen AI, for 
example to develop and deliver customized and 
adaptive training programs, and even to onboard 
employees. 

For example, another European telco saw 
firsthand the importance of change management 
and upskilling when it created a gen-AI-driven 
knowledge “expert” that helped agents get 
answers to customer questions more quickly. 
The initial pilot, which didn’t include any process 
changes or employee education, realized just 
a 5 percent improvement in productivity. As 
the organization prepared to scale the solution, 
leaders dedicated 90 percent of the budget 
to agent training and change management 
processes, which facilitated the adoption of the 
solution and resulted in more than 30 percent 
productivity improvement. The telco also used 
gen AI to create upskilling programs and provide 
agents with personalized recommendations for 
improvement once the solution was rolled out.

Even though so many companies have already 
achieved real cost savings and revenue 
improvements with gen AI, these are still the early 
days of the technology. In the next five years, 
emerging capabilities—including significant 
improvements in natural language understanding, 
advances in human-like reasoning across 
multiple topics, and availability of real-time 
solutions with increased accuracy and fewer 
hallucinations—should unlock even more exciting 
opportunities beyond the basic improvements 
seen today.

Combined, these gen AI capabilities will enable 
telcos to redefine industry standards and set 
themselves apart in the market. For example, 
network operations could be enhanced and 
quality standards radically recast with AI copilots 
that evaluate images from technicians, provide 
accurate recommendations for remedies, and 
automatically initiate interventions or work 
orders. In sales, cognitive copilots could conduct 
sentiment analysis on customer calls in real 
time and guide sales representatives on how 
best to respond, profoundly altering sales 
strategies, customer engagement, and overall 
sales outcomes. Customer service channels

using cognitive chatbots could seamlessly 
answer complex queries in real time while taking 
into account privacy and fairness concerns, 
thereby revolutionizing efficiency while offering 
customers a human-like experience. Across the 
enterprise, greater efficiency and productivity 
could emerge, as domain-specific solutions 
endowed with an organization’s institutional 
knowledge power an unprecedented wave of 
automation and AI-driven decision making.

The sudden rise of gen AI has brought the 
dream of the AI-native telco significantly 

closer to becoming a reality. With it comes the 
opportunity for telcos to reverse their recent 
stagnant fortunes and usher in a new era of 
growth and innovation. The journey will not be 
easy, however. To answer the call of gen AI, telcos 
will need to quickly adopt a culture of innovation 
and experimentation enabled by the core 
building blocks shared in this article, one they 
have previously struggled to build and maintain. 
With the technology moving so rapidly, those 
operators that embrace it now are likeliest to 
create a significant lead that will be difficult for 
others to follow.

Generative AI’s impact on telecom operators is likely to be between $60 billion and $100 billion, 
according to McKinsey estimates. To capture this new value, organizations will benefit from 
developing a strategy and implementation road map of use cases across the entire organization. 
This road map should encompass key areas such as marketing and sales, customer experience (CX), 
customer service, IT, networks, and support functions. At successful companies, implementation 
involves a careful choice of priorities and critical decisions based on expected impact and feasibility. 
Successful companies also tend to favor quick wins to start building capabilities, including the main 
building blocks: governance, data, talent, and technologies. Strengthening this core enables the 
move from proofs of concept to use cases at scale.

In the following exhibits, we examine the use cases that hold the most promise for telcos and apply 
to the broader technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector. Individually, these use 
cases deliver incremental improvements on existing processes. Taken together, they add up to a 
radical reimagination of the telco of the future. 

This is only the beginning. As gen AI continues to develop and mature, it will unleash even more 
exciting approaches to fostering creativity, innovation, and growth.

Telco vision: Gen AI will drive the next wave of productivity and 
innovation
The technology is poised to unlock an array of new efficiencies, improving the way telecom 
operators attract customers, provide service, maintain networks, and develop software and 
systems—potentially reigniting growth after a long period of stagnation (Exhibit 1).

Tech talent in transition: 
Seven technology trends 
reshaping telcos

With technologies like edge computing, AI, and xRAN transforming telecom, 
leaders are reassessing how to capture value. Rethinking talent is a key piece 
of the puzzle.

by Tomás Lajous, Stephanie Madner, Carlo Palermo, and Rens van den Broek

October 2023

The telecom industry is evolving quickly, as 
businesses and consumers seek out game-
changing use cases—from autonomous vehicles 
to robotic surgery to an unfathomable range 
of seamless digital interactions—that operate 
on the back of telcos’ substantial 5G 
infrastructure investments.

We then offer an approach to guide telcos through 
the complex process of fulfilling their immediate 
and long-term talent needs. While this approach is 
rooted in the present trend landscape, it is 
designed with adaptability in mind and as such will 
be relevant and applicable to future tech trends 
that may rise in prominence.

Telco leaders are broadly aware of the magnitude 
of transformation that the moment demands, and 
many are creating elaborate plans to overhaul 
everything from business models to operations to 
customer experience. Ongoing excitement about 
the potential of AI, driven by advances in generative 
AI, is pushing the industry to rethink the scope of its 
transformation plans. However, many telco leaders 
are struggling to manage the talent implications of 
these shifts, including determining what talent they 
need and how to beat out the competition to get it.

The industry has certainly not lacked for 
engineering PhDs or other markers of technical 
acumen over the years. But the tech talent market 
and telcos’ position within it have changed 
dramatically since the generation that is now on the 
brink of retirement embarked on their careers.

Moreover, not all tech talent is created equal. As 
telcos evolve to deliver on the opportunities that 
AI, augmented and virtual reality, and other 
emerging technologies unlock, they will need to be 
highly strategic about identifying and attracting 
talent with the expertise and abilities that each 
technology demands.

To frame the path ahead, we outline seven broad 
tech trends that are reshaping the telco industry, 
along with the talent implications of these trends—
including the specific skill sets and capabilities 
required, as well as those that will likely be 
phased out. These current tech trends create an 
urgency for telcos to act now and identify critical 
talent pools to develop.

The terrain here is not friendly. Long gone are the 
days when telcos were the employer of choice for 
technical talent. Over the next decade, demand for 
certain tech roles is expected to further increase 20 
to 30 percent across US industries—potentially 
outpacing the supply of recent STEM graduates, 
which grew just 5 to 10 percent annually from 2015 
to 2019. For some roles, telcos’ demand is expected 
to outstrip that of other industries: by 2031, for 
example, telcos’ demand for electrical engineers is 
expected to grow 24.4 percent, compared with 
5.9 percent in other sectors (Exhibit 1).

Telco operators with ambitious goals regarding 
diversity, equity, and inclusion should be particularly 
intentional about developing sustainable, long-term 
talent pipelines. McKinsey research shows that 
diverse organizations increasingly outperform their 
nondiverse peers. Telcos’ current tech talent pools 
tend to be less diverse than their overall talent 
pools; if operators’ current talent acquisition and 
development patterns continue, they stand to 
become even less diverse overall as their tech 
talent pipeline grows.

Seven tech trends shaping telcos

As  digital  transformation  continues  to  accelerate, 
we  are  on  the  cusp  of  further  seismic  changes  to 
how  we  work,  live,  travel,  and  interact.  The  seven 
trends described below are poised to redefine 

Tech talent in transition: Seven technology trends reshaping telcos

customers’ expectations of telcos—and the role 
that telcos can play in individuals’ lives and the 
success of organizations.

Each technology will require telcos to grow and 
stretch in new ways, compelling telco leaders to 
determine early on where to place bets and to 
continually refine their priorities as the landscape 
shifts and technology evolves further. As telcos hire 
the talent needed to embrace the seven tech 
trends, they will have less need for skills that can 
now be automated or are specific to outmoded 
legacy infrastructure.

At every stage, having the right talent in place 
will distinguish the leaders from their less 
successful peers.

1. Ever-expanding connectivity
Fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications
infrastructure is dramatically expanding and
improving connectivity, and sixth-generation (6G)
infrastructure is poised to amplify this trend.

Near-limitless connectivity will pave the way for 
new services like remote patient monitoring and 
next-generation customer experiences like virtual 
dressing rooms and conferences that take place 
entirely in the metaverse.

Demand for connectivity is expected to increase 
further as customers seek out these innovative 
solutions and as the number of connected devices 
grows to a projected 51.9 billion by 2025,1 up from 
43 billion in 2020. Remote work is also fueling 

Exhibit 1

demand, with 51 percent of Americans working from 
home at least one day a week.2 Moreover, 5G and 
6G are estimated to expand connectivity to up to 
80 percent of the global population by 2030.3

To meet this demand, telcos will need to 
exponentially increase network capacity, improve 
data throughput and spectrum, and reduce latency 
and energy consumption. In addition to extending 
coverage to individuals, telcos may have an 
opportunity to raise B2B revenues by developing 
premium connectivity solutions for specific 
use cases.

This will require talent with skills in network and 
spectrum design to work on strategy and 
architecture; network engineering, to design 
architecture and develop applications; network 
innovation, to develop emerging RAN (radio access 
network), network functions virtualization, 
Kubernetes, etcetera; network maintenance 
monitoring, to handle emergencies and to fix 
breaks; and IoT, to develop applications, platforms, 
and APIs.

Engineering and operational capabilities specific 
to legacy technologies, such as digital subscriber 
line (DSL), 2G and 3G cellular networks, and 
traditional cable TV infrastructure, will likely no 
longer be needed. The talent base, therefore, will 
need to adapt.

2. Edge computing
As computing workloads are distributed across
remote data centers located closer to end users,
latency will drop, bandwidth will increase, and
organizations will gain more sovereignty over their
data. Edge computing allows for real-time data
processing, which will unlock use cases across
industries—from remote healthcare treatment to
remote management of mining operations to
sustainability solutions like smart grids that
optimize energy consumption.

A recent McKinsey survey of 75 telco executives 
across North America and Western Europe 
detected a great deal of interest in a variety of edge 
computing use cases (Exhibit 2). The survey results 
showed that a majority of telcos are engaging with 
edge computing on some level, with a quarter 
already deploying it or actively planning to scale it. 
More than half of the executives (55 percent) 
surveyed said their primary goal is improving 
network efficiency and performance, while others 
cited enabling new use cases for businesses 
(21 percent) or for consumers (18 percent).

As telcos embrace edge computing, they will face 
rising costs from energy consumption, network 
maintenance, and investments associated with 
reconfiguring network backhaul and backbone.

The move toward edge computing requires telco 
talent with skills in network and system design to 
work on data strategy and architecture; network 
engineering, to enable the installation and 
integration of devices, software, and systems; 
network innovation, to improve the performance of 
systems; network maintenance, to fix breaks and 
handle emergencies; database management, to 
manage data storage, distribution, and analysis; 
and security, to minimize fraud, monitor risk, and 
handle compliance.

The rise of cloud-based solutions, automation, and 
managed services will reduce demand for on-site IT 
setup and maintenance roles.

3. Next-generation transportation
The first two tech trends, expanded connectivity
and edge computing, lay the groundwork for a third:
next-generation transportation. The shift toward
autonomous, connected, electric, and smart
technologies has vast implications for air and land

transportation, with the potential to make human 
travel and the transport of goods far more efficient 
and environmentally sustainable.

The transportation industry will increasingly 
prioritize electric, hydrogen-based, and hybrid 
propulsion as new modes for ground and air 
mobility. An expected rise in data traffic and 

autonomous-landing applications may allow 
businesses to expand their markets, reaching 
new customer segments in previously 
unserviceable locations.

As transportation evolves, telcos will need to 
increase bandwidth for mobility, particularly in 
remote areas, and provide flawless emergency

backup coverage. They will also have an 
opportunity to combine core connectivity with 
vehicular technologies and real-time mobility data 
to offer solutions like hands-free driving, 
infotainment, networks of smart electric vehicle 
chargers, and “vehicle to everything” (V2X) 
technology—which allows vehicles to connect with 
their surroundings, including other vehicles and 
human drivers.

Telcos will need talent with skills in network design 
to develop algorithms for vehicle connectivity; 
network engineering, innovation, and maintenance, 
to enable vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity; 
automation, to leverage machine learning and AI for 
infotainment; IoT architecture, to enable voice 
recognition and gesture control; UX design, to 
enhance the user experience; and data science, for 
collecting and processing data.

4. xRAN
New approaches to RAN can bring flexibility to 
telcos’ relationship with OEMs and even reduce 
physical-asset requirements like towers, antennas, 
and cabling, thereby cutting capital and operational 
spending, accelerating the deployment of new 
network services, and spurring competition 
among vendors.

Falling under the umbrella of “xRAN,” these new 
approaches include open RAN (ORAN), which will 
allow for seamless interoperability among hardware 
and software from disparate vendors when it 
reaches maturity; centralized RAN (CRAN), which 
allows multiple mobile sites to share equipment; 
and virtualized RAN (VRAN), which supports 
scalability and network agility by decoupling 
network hardware from software.

encourage new vendors to enter the market and 
lead to more competitive pricing. This flexibility may 
lower the risk telcos face when they adopt new 
hardware or software solutions. And the availability 
of intelligent, virtualized, and interoperable 
functions will allow organizations to assemble 
tailored solutions that increase their capacity.

Our survey of telco executives indicates a strong 
interest in ORAN in particular, with 76 percent of 
executives at incumbent telcos and 88 percent of 
executives at new entrants planning to invest in the 
new approach. Overall, 60 percent of executives 
indicated that they plan to use ORAN for at least 
20 to 30 percent of new network build-outs.

To accomplish this, telcos will need talent skilled 
in agile working to enhance engineering practices 
and innovation deployment; data engineering, 
to develop architecture; cloud, to develop and 
test solutions that xRAN enables; product 
management, to enable the evolution of xRAN; 
and DevOps, to build solutions and accelerate the 
transition to xRAN.

There will be less need for proprietary hardware 
knowledge, closed system integration skills, and 
manual operational capabilities specific to legacy 
RAN systems.

5. Trust architecture and digital identity
As organizations build and scale digitally enabled
products and services that hinge on collecting vast
troves of customer data, trust and privacy will
become even more essential. Zero trust
architecture, digital identity, and privacy
engineering will become more prevalent as
companies seek to gain a competitive edge by
establishing stakeholders’ trust.

xRAN has the potential to improve telcos’ total cost 
of ownership by allowing them to choose different 
suppliers for different needs—a dynamic that may

digital trust, IT security, and data visibility, telcos

should consider investing in cybersecurity 
solutions. Those that do so will position themselves 
to introduce new offerings by building digital 
identity services on next-generation networks 
and technologies.

To realize this potential, telcos will need talent with 
skills in digital identity development to provide 
solutions and trusted technologies; cybersecurity 
solution architecture and engineering, to ensure 
assessment and secure access to networks and 
applications; automation, to create digital identity 
solutions and tools; privacy engineering, to handle 
risk and compliance; network engineering, to 
develop apps and architecture; network 
maintenance, to monitor and manage emergencies; 
and DevOps, to automate configuration, continuous 
delivery, and infrastructure.

Manual production and review of compliance 
documentation will be phased out.

6. Artificial intelligence
Advances in AI—and in generative AI, in
particular—are unlocking opportunities for
organizations at every point along the value chain.
Telcos can use AI to optimize networks (by
managing resources based on real-time traffic and
data analysis); proactively address maintenance
issues (by analyzing patterns and anomalies to
identify problems before they occur); and minimize
churn (by analyzing customers’ behavior to identify
those most likely to leave). By coupling AI-powered
cameras and sensors with AI-enabled network
maintenance automation, telcos can substantially
reduce the costs associated with network
infrastructure management.

Generative AI can transform customer experience 
by supplying customers with highly personalized 
content, offers, and proactive service-related 
outreach based on usage patterns, purchase 

history, and other considerations. By analyzing 
customer behavior trends, generative AI can 
enhance product development and accelerate 
innovation; it might suggest new features for a 
mobile app or new plans targeting specific 
customer segments. By using generative AI to 
simulate sophisticated cyberattacks, operators 
can identify vulnerabilities and enhance 
network resilience.

To maximize the AI opportunity, telcos will need 
talent with skills in interface design to create 
excellent user experiences; natural language 
processing engineering, for AI speech recognition; 
data engineering, to work on data architecture, 
software, and big data; data science, to create 
mathematical machine learning models; and 
security, to prevent and manage cyberattacks.

As infrastructure is increasingly managed through 
software, AI will supplant the need for routine 
manual troubleshooting.

7. Quantum technology
Our survey reflects broad consensus among telco
executives regarding the impact of quantum
technology, with 52 percent saying they believe
that quantum will be a differentiating advantage
for telcos in the next five years (and an additional
32 percent saying they somewhat agree with
this assessment).

Executives see the highest strategic value in 
developing quantum key distribution (QKD) 
networks, which allow for the secure exchange of 
cryptographic keys. Roughly half of executives are 
already engaging with quantum technology to 
protect customer data or improve procedures for 
authenticating users’ IoT devices (55 percent), 
protect telco infrastructure through encryption 
(53 percent), or encrypt traffic within the network 
(48 percent).

Tech talent in transition: Seven technology trends reshaping telcos

776

At the same time, quantum computing will put 
conventional encryption methods at risk by opening 
new attack vectors. Organizations are already 
growing concerned about “harvest now, decrypt 
later” attacks, in which bad actors steal encrypted 
data in hopes of using quantum computers to 
decrypt it in the future. By harnessing quantum 
technology, telcos can equip themselves with tools 
to combat these sophisticated threats; QKD, for 
example, allows communicating parties to be 
alerted any time an intruder attempts to eavesdrop 
on an encrypted exchange.

Advances in quantum technology also have the 
potential to exponentially increase computational 
performance and the speed of communication. 
But despite telco leaders’ enthusiasm, very 
few organizations are actively deploying quantum 
at scale.

To move beyond internal discussions and test-and-
learn pilots, telcos will need talent with expertise in 
quantum technology (such as quantum algorithms, 
computer architectures, superconducting circuits, 
and machine learning); high-performance 
computing, to engage with the ecosystem on pilots 
in areas like QKD; software and hardware security 
and crypto-agility, to prevent cyberattacks and 
manage cryptography transformations as threat 
levels and standards evolve; network engineering, 
to design hybrid classical/quantum networks, 
codevelop and pilot critical equipment for optical 
communications, and explore the potential of 
satellite and fiber for quantum communications; and 
product management, to monetize quantum 
networks and security.

Designing a telco talent road map

To get ahead of these seven tech trends, telcos will 
need to develop long-term strategies for 
cultivating, attracting, and retaining the right talent, 
with the right skills. Leading organizations will 
prioritize diversity at every stage, from strategy 
design through implementation. They will also 
engage business leaders from the outset, ensuring 
that they help shape the tech talent strategy—and 
that they own it.

Phase one: Identify the talent implications of 
business strategy
When it comes to incorporating new technologies, 
one of the most common challenges telcos face is 
targeting investments directly to those capabilities 
that fully align with their broader business goals. In 
the context of a telco’s business strategy and 
competitive landscape, some of the seven tech 
trends outlined above may be more beneficial or 
immediately relevant than others.

Telcos can start the process of getting the right 
tech talent in place by defining their vision for 
business success over the next three to five years. 
They can then conduct thorough business impact 
assessments of the seven tech trends to evaluate 
how each trend might fuel ambitions like expanding 
market share, enhancing customer experience, or 
increasing operational efficiency. Telcos can then 
work backward to pinpoint the skills and 
capabilities required to lean into the technologies 
most pivotal to meeting business objectives. Some 
examples of the different approaches a telco might 
take depending on its primary goal include:

Engineering and operational capabilities specific to 
traditional network optimization methods, using 
classical computation, will become less relevant.

— A telco aiming to boost its B2B leadership 

might opt to invest heavily in edge computing 
and quantum technology. These tech trends

enable faster data processing and secure 
communications, which are particularly 
attractive to business clients.

— A telco aiming to distinguish itself through 

superior customer experience might prioritize 
AI, which can enhance customer engagement 
and customer service through personalized 
offerings, automated responses, and 
proactive outreach.

— A telco focusing on global reach and seamless 
connectivity might prioritize ever-expanding 
connectivity by investing heavily in 6G. It may 
deprioritize trends like quantum technology, 
which may not immediately contribute to 
expanded network coverage.

— A telco seeking to increase network flexibility 
while reducing costs might prioritize xRAN. 
Such a telco may place less emphasis on ever-
expanding connectivity, as its main goal would 
be improving the existing network architecture 
rather than expanding reach.

assessments of how demand for each role will 
change. For operators that are serious about 
diversifying the workforce, it will be important to 
understand how demographic variations play out 
across the talent pool.

At this stage, telcos can also look at broader shifts 
in supply and demand for different types of roles 
across the economy. In addition to examining how 
their hiring rates must evolve, it will be important to 
consider the sheer numbers involved.

Here are some questions telcos might consider 
when determining which talent pools to prioritize:

— What is the business value at risk if we don’t 

secure this talent pool?

— How scarce is the market for this type of talent?

— How difficult is it to upskill existing or readily 

available talent to fill this gap?

—  How demographically diverse are the traditional 

sources for this talent pool?

— A telco looking to position itself as a technology 

pioneer might prioritize quantum technology. It 
may place less importance on trends like xRAN, 
as its primary focus would be on pushing the 
boundaries of technology rather than 
restructuring the existing network.

By clarifying which skills are most critical and which 
are most easily attainable, operators can focus 
investments in the areas that matter most. Over 
time, they can adjust and expand into other 
talent pools.

Phase two: Assess talent gaps and define 
talent priorities
Once operators are clear on the work that needs to 
be done and the skills and capabilities required to 
do it, they can gauge the size of the talent gaps that 
will need filling and determine which types of talent 
to prioritize.

They can start by mapping out current hiring and 
attrition patterns against forward-looking 

Phase three: Design tech talent strategy and 
operating model
After clarifying their talent needs, telcos can begin 
formulating a comprehensive talent strategy. This 
should include a portfolio of innovative initiatives to 
hire, train, and retain tech talent, as well as outline 
the necessary infrastructure and other enablers. 
Key enablers include flexible work arrangements, 
learning and development platforms that function 
as hubs for training resources and online courses,

and talent management solutions that span the 
employee life cycle, from recruitment through 
succession planning.

When it comes to tech talent, it is difficult to 
overstate the importance of long-term thinking. 
Despite recent layoffs at high-profile tech 
companies, the tech talent shortage persists across 
industries and could last longer than expected. 
Tech unemployment in the United States is 
2.1 percent—just over half the overall 
unemployment rate of 3.8 percent.4 Close to three-
quarters of US tech sector workers who were laid 
off in 2022 found a job within three months, 
according to data from Revelio Labs.5 And the 
demand for tech talent will continue to soar.

Because tech talent pipelines tend to be 
particularly homogenous, telcos risk regressing on 
their overall diversity goals if they fail to identify 
new talent sources. In the United States, just 
21 percent of those graduating with a bachelor’s 
degree in computer science are women, 9 percent 
are Black, and 11 percent are Latino.6

By thinking ahead, operators can open up the 
available solution space and creatively expand their 
talent pipelines into nontraditional pools and 
geographical areas. Solutions like these take time 
but can turn the tide—helping the sector shed its 
reputation as hierarchical and stodgy, and 
reposition itself as an agile, nimble, tech-forward 
employer of choice.

Reimagine career development and the 
employee value proposition. 
As enablers of the most exciting technologies on 
the horizon, operators have a powerful opportunity 
to reshape how they are perceived in the talent 
market. Telcos that pay close attention to tech 
talent’s unique needs, desires, and priorities can 
reposition themselves to attract the caliber of 
talent that has seemed hopelessly out of reach 
for many.

Recent McKinsey research shows that digital talent 
places a premium on career development and 
advancement potential—prioritizing these on par 
with compensation. With new technologies 
emerging at a dizzying pace, tech workers crave 
opportunities to learn from experts and peers and 
to build skills by rotating among different projects 
and teams.

Our research also found that tech talent values 
purpose and meaningful work. They want to 
understand how the tasks that fill their own days 
support the mission of the broader organization. 
By creating innovative career development 
opportunities and a clear sense of purpose, 
telcos signal that they’re attuned to what tech 
talent wants.

Build holistic university partnerships. 
Across industries, leading organizations are 
reimagining how they work with universities. They 
are moving beyond discrete internship programs 
and transactional recruiting efforts that target 
graduating seniors—instead, they are establishing 
durable pipelines designed with their specific talent 
and diversity needs in mind. Done well, these 
partnerships also provide students with highly 
sought-after skills and enhance the communities in 
which telcos operate.

Leading operators are building detailed models to 
identify the best target universities for such 
partnerships. These models assess universities’ 
ability to deliver large volumes of high-quality, 
diverse talent. They also assess the operator’s 
ability to compete with other companies and 
sectors for talent at each university, based on 
factors including geographical proximity, alumni 
presence at the telco, network presence and 
performance on campus, and ability to meet 
graduates’ salary expectations.

Holistic university partnerships can take different 
forms. Qualcomm and several of its top executives 
or directors have invested heavily over the years in 
a single university, University of California San 
Diego; since the late 1990s, company cofounder 
Irwin Jacobs has invested more than $300 million 
in the university’s engineering programs, healthcare 
system, and School of Global Policy and Strategy 
through scholarships and other support for 
students, faculty, and research.

In another approach, Apple’s HBCU C2 initiative, 
launched in partnership with Tennessee State 
University, creates coding centers for learners of all 
ages at historically Black colleges and universities 
nationwide; it has already expanded into 45 
educational institutions. And Lockheed Martin has 
partnered with the University of Colorado Boulder 
to fund a research center focused on radio 
frequency and space systems as well as an 
engineering management certificate program.

Launch or join tech talent consortiums. 
Organizations are increasingly seeing the value of 
partnering with businesses, government agencies, 
and other players to solve collective talent 
challenges. Tech talent consortiums, which provide 
learners of all ages and backgrounds with skill-
building opportunities, are promising models for 
such collaboration. They may be regional or global 
in nature, and while some focus on specific 

industries, others take a broader lens to developing 
cross-industry tech talent.

Telcos may choose to start their own consortium or 
join one that already exists—like the National GEM 
Consortium (GEM), which recruits demographically 
diverse students interested in pursuing graduate-
level degrees in applied science and engineering

As technology continues to evolve, so should telcos’ 
strategies for capturing tech talent. Early movers 
give themselves the runway to experiment with 
creative strategies that may pay dividends in the 
long run—and to adapt and hone these strategies 
based on rigorous evaluations.

Telcos’ future success rests on their ability to make 
the most of the opportunities that emerging 
technologies present. Multiple elements will need to 
fall into place, and telco leaders are developing 
ambitious transformation plans. But talent strategy 
is also a critical part of the equation, and it’s often 
not getting the attention it deserves. Business 
leaders would be well-advised to take the reins in 
shaping and steering tech talent strategy to ensure 
they have the people to get the job done.

Generative AI can empower people—but only if leaders take a broad view of its 
capabilities and deeply consider its implications for the organization.

“We were behind on automation and digitization, 
and we finally closed the gap. We don’t want to be 
left behind again, but we aren’t sure how to think 
about generative AI.”

That’s the sentiment shared by many global 
executives, given the speed with which generative 
artificial intelligence (gen AI)1 is advancing in the 
business world. The technology is accessible, 
ubiquitous, and promises to have a significant 
impact on organizations and the economy over the 
next decade.

Anyone can use gen AI, with little or no formal 
training or technical know-how. It is being 
embedded in everyday tools, like email, word 
processing applications, and meeting software, 
which means the technology is already positioned 
to radically transform how people work. And 
McKinsey research shows that gen AI could enable 
automation of up to 70 percent of business 
activities, across almost all occupations, between 
now and 2030, adding trillions of dollars in value to 
the global economy.2

Meanwhile, technologists keep reminding us that 
gen AI is only in its nascent stages of development 
and usage. This smart technology is only going to 
get more intelligent—and those who don’t learn to 
work with it, starting now, will be left behind.3

In this supercharged environment, how can 
organizations do more than just “keep up”? What 
strategies, structures, and talent management 
approaches will business leaders need to adopt to 
prepare their organizations for a gen-AI-driven 
future? We examine these and other critical 
questions in this article.

The situation is evolving rapidly, and there is, 
frankly, no one right answer to the question of how 
to successfully roll out gen AI in the organization—
business context matters.

But to start, business leaders will need to think 
broadly about how the rollout of Gen AI could affect 
their organizations day to day—especially their 
people. Employees and managers should have a 
clear understanding of gen AI’s strengths and 
weaknesses and how use of the technology is 
linked to the organization’s strategic objectives. 
Given the technology’s potential to accelerate 
automation, senior leaders could counter 
employees’ prevailing fears of “replacement and 
loss” with messaging about gen AI’s potential for 
“augmentation and improvement”—and its ability to 
significantly enhance the employee experience. 
Imagine, for example, a world with fewer meetings 
and more time to think.

The central task for senior leaders, then, is to 
demystify the technology for others; that will mean 
taking a step back to assess the strategic 
implications of gen AI, or the risks and opportunities 
for industries and business models. As leaders build 
a compelling narrative for the use of gen AI, they 
will also need to identify two or three high-impact 
applications to explore and bring employees along 
on a value-creating journey—taking gen AI 
initiatives from pilot test to rapid scaling to “business 
as usual” status. Senior leaders will also need to 
commit to building the required roles, skills, and 
capabilities (now and for the future), so they can 
continually test and learn with gen AI and stay 
ahead of competitors.

Are you thinking broadly enough 
about gen AI’s potential impact?

McKinsey research suggests that, because of the 
emergence of gen AI, about half of today’s business 
activities could be automated a decade earlier than 
previous estimates had projected.4 Gen-AI-enabled 
automation has already begun—and, as the 
research shows, is likely to affect hours, tasks, and 
responsibilities for workers across wage rates and

AI, in part, because of the scope of outputs it can create.

educational backgrounds. In fact, the research 
shows that gen AI will have an especially profound 
effect on professions traditionally requiring higher 
levels of education, such as educators and lawyers.5

Gen AI is also likely to inform discussions in the 
C-suite about how the company creates value and
whether the addition of gen AI capabilities allows
for industry or business model reinvention. As a
result, leaders should ask themselves a range of
critical questions relating to the “new” nature of
work in gen-AI-enabled organizations, including
the following:

What are the organization-wide implications of 
gen AI? Rather than taking a passive approach to 
identifying potential use cases and investments 
associated with gen AI, leaders should view the 
situation through an “attacker’s lens.” They should 
consider all the primary, secondary, and even 
tertiary effects of gen AI: Which business use cases 
are highest priority now—and which might be 
candidates for gen AI enablement in six months, 12 
months, and so on? What changes will be required 
at a functional level to make gen AI enablement 
possible—for instance, how many more software 
engineers will the company need? And as gen AI 
functionality continues to be embedded in common 
word processing, email, and communications tools 
(Microsoft’s 365 Copilot, for instance), what effect 
will that have on ways of working across the entire 
organization? Could gen AI accelerate the shift to a 
four-day work week? And even more broadly, how 
might entire industries or business models be 
fundamentally disrupted?

continued evolution of gen AI applications in the 
organization (see sidebar “Speeding up the search 
for tech talent”). They should also consider whether 
that same structure can satisfy the need for gen AI 
oversight (see sidebar “A powerful resource with 
potential risks”).

How can corporate culture enable or inhibit the 
adoption and usage of gen AI? Gen AI applications 
can be the catalyst for culture change—in more 
ways than one. The applications themselves can 
create more organizational transparency and 
connectivity. One company, for instance, is piloting 
a gen AI application that allows users to ask 
questions about operations, sales, and other topics, 
and the tool draws from the company’s entire 
collection of intellectual property to come up with 
answers that can guide users to the most relevant 
experts and data. Employees report feeling better 
informed and more connected. Additionally, the 
same cultural traits that have been crucial for 
organizational success during recent economic and 
business upheavals—such as adaptability, speed, 
agility, trust, integrity, learning and experimentation, 
innovation, and a willingness to change—will be 
even more important if organizations want to 
become truly enabled by gen AI. To understand 
why, consider the findings from the 2023 McKinsey 
Digital survey of 1,000 organizations, which found a 
significant synergy between organizations with 
strong, innovative cultures and their ability to 
increase value through new digital technologies, 
including gen AI.6 In previous iterations of that 
survey, respondents said the biggest obstacle to 
their digital success was a culture that was averse 
to risk and experimentation.7

Does the organization have the right technical 
talent and risk infrastructure in place? Leaders 
should consider which operating-model designs will 
be most effective for ensuring the long-term 
development of technology talent and the

How should organizations change their talent 
management approaches? Gen AI applications will 
have unprecedented effects on organizations’ 
approaches to talent management. Consider the

Speeding up the search for tech talent

In the coming months and years, 
demand for those who have mastered 
working with and alongside gen AI will 
skyrocket—especially for those who build 
and engineer gen AI tools and those who 
are in the business of generating content 
via gen AI. (We call the latter “creators,” 
and they can include product managers, 
marketing managers, and so on.)

To speed up and simplify the search for 
this critical tech talent amid heavy 
competition, business leaders should first 
identify the types of gen AI applications 
they need to build. They can then use 
those insights to identify the type and 
amount of tech talent they will need in the 
short term—and how to retain that talent 
for the longer term.

What gen AI applications are we building 
ourselves? The first decision involves 
deciding—in collaboration with IT, R&D, 
and business unit leaders—what 

applications to build and what applications 
to adapt from off-the-shelf products.1 Gen 
AI applications can be expensive and 
complicated to build, requiring significant 
technical know-how. Once built, the 
applications must be continuously updated 
or risk losing utility. What’s more, training 
new gen AI applications takes significantly 
more energy than using or refining 
existing ones.

Who do we need to build these gen AI 
applications? Once they know what 
applications they need to build and buy, 
senior leaders can examine the technology 
roles and responsibilities they will need to 
create value from gen AI. Organizations will 
need engineering and software 
development talent, but they will also need 
translator roles—including implementation 
coaches, educators, and trainers—to 
facilitate the understanding and adoption 
of gen AI across the organization.

How do we develop and retain this tech 
talent? According to McKinsey research, 
opportunities for career development, the 
potential for advancement, and 
compensation are the top factors 
technology professionals consider. The 
chance to learn is another key draw, with 
professionals reporting a desire to work in 
an organization that provides employees 
with opportunities to practice new skills.2 
To meet these requirements and increase 
the likelihood of retaining top tech talent, 
senior leaders could explore the use of 
programs such as peer-to-peer learning, 
functional rotations that expose 
technologists to other parts of the 
organization, and upskilling.3

It can augment the employee experience. Gen AI 
applications can assist employees in ways that 
many workers may not even expect. For instance, 
gen AI can suggest the new lines of code required 
to update a financial-reporting system or outline 
the A and B versions of a marketing campaign or 
otherwise create first drafts that human employees 
can take and implement in live production 
environments. And by facilitating the training and 
upskilling process, gen AI applications can help 
employees pick up new skills more quickly. A recent 
study, for instance, found that software engineers 
completed their coding tasks up to twice as fast 
when using gen AI and reported more satisfaction 
with the process.10

It can empower middle managers. The benefits of 
gen AI can accrue not just to frontline workers but 
also to middle managers. In fact, as the people 
closest to employees, middle managers have a 
critical role to play in increasing employees’ comfort 
with both short-term gen-AI-enabled work and 
long-term collaborations with the technology.11 And 
as their own direct reports learn to work with gen 
AI, middle managers may find themselves 
overseeing more and different kinds of work 
streams, moving at a pace never seen before. At 
the same time, the use of gen AI can free up 
more capacity for middle managers, so they can 
shift their attention to higher-value leadership 
tasks, such as strategy-focused work and 
people management.

It can help organizations reinvent their talent 
management practices. The emergence of gen AI 
presents an opportunity for organizations to hone 
their approaches to attracting, retaining, and 
developing talent—particularly when it comes to 
creators and tech professionals. HR professionals 
could use gen AI to send personalized outreach 
emails to candidates and to design job search 
experiences for candidates in underrepresented

groups; research suggests this work could 
dramatically increase the number and diversity of 
applications for various roles.12 Gen AI applications 
could also help companies match new hires with 
mentors and coaches to improve the onboarding 
experience, upskill talent, and streamline 
administrative tasks.

It can prompt senior leaders to lead differently.  
Senior leaders face the dual responsibility of quickly 
implementing gen AI today and anticipating future 
versions of gen AI technologies and their 
implications. More than anyone else in the 
organization, they will need to be evangelists for gen 
AI, encouraging the development and adoption of 
the technology organization wide. That will mean 
working with other business unit and technology 
leaders to allocate resources to update technology 
infrastructure and take any interim process steps 
required to facilitate the gen AI rollout—for instance, 
moving applications to private cloud-hosted 
environments. In fact, a central task for senior 
leaders will be to find ways to forge stronger 
connections between technology leaders and the 
business units. One company, for example, launched 
a Slack channel devoted to ongoing discussion of 
gen AI pilots. Through such forums, employees, 
product developers, and other business and 
technology leaders can share stories about their 
experiences with gen AI, whether and how their 
daily tasks have changed, and their thoughts on the 
gen AI journey so far.

As they would when introducing any new 
technology, senior leaders should speak clearly 
about the business objectives of gen AI, 
communicating early and often about gen AI’s role 
in “augmenting versus replacing” jobs. They should 
paint a compelling picture of how various aspects of 
the organization will be rewired through gen AI—
technically, financially, culturally, and so on.

Of course, if senior leaders don’t understand the 
technology themselves, it will be more difficult to 
make this case for, and lead their teams into, a gen-
AI-enabled future. One way for leaders to stay 
plugged in is to establish forums that provide 
ongoing professional education on advances in AI 
technology and applications. Another approach is to 
carve out time during planning meetings to 
consider forward-looking questions such as, “Is our 
approach to gen AI today flexible enough to 
accommodate the next iteration, and the one after 
that?” and “Which process steps or roles will we be 
able to reinvent with the next iteration of gen AI?”

Time to flex your gen AI muscle

Although generative AI burst onto the scene 
seemingly overnight, CEOs and other business 
leaders can ill afford to take an overly cautious 
approach to introducing it in their organizations. If 
ever a business opportunity demanded a bias for 
action, this is it. By taking the following three steps 
simultaneously, and with a sense of urgency, 
leaders can do more than just “keep up”—they can 
capture early gains and stay ahead of competitors.

Demystify gen AI for everyone. Senior leaders 
themselves should develop a deep understanding 
of gen AI and associated capabilities themselves so 
they can help to demystify the technology for the 
rest of the organization. They can then help to 
introduce mechanisms for managing uncertainties 
about gen AI where they exist—for instance, 
establishing clear guidance regarding the use of 
gen AI tools in hiring and recruiting where AI model 
biases could emerge.

Identify two or three high-impact use cases—and 
just get started. Senior leaders should carefully 
consider their investments in gen AI pilots, and “go

big” on those that show the greatest promise of 
scalability and long-term value—whether it’s an 
application that simplifies financial reporting or one 
that enhances onboarding for new hires. As part of 
this vetting process, senior leaders should consider 
the business or industry risks or opportunities 
associated with implementing the gen AI pilot, as 
well as how hard or easy it will be to move the pilot 
into production and make it a part of employees’ 
day-to-day experiences. Once that vetting has 
happened, senior leaders should steer resources 
accordingly and take care to monitor and measure 
the outputs from gen AI initiatives and pilots. 
Remember, some gen AI initiatives may show 
impact in the next 12 months, while others may 
require investment now to yield results in two to 
five years. The longer-term goal, then, should be to 
set up a sustainable engine for the rapid upskilling 
of employees and scaling of gen AI and other 
digital capabilities.

Commit to building the necessary roles, skills, 
and capabilities—now and in the future. Senior 
leaders should commit to building employees’ gen 
AI skills so they can use the technology judiciously 
and successfully in their day-to-day work. It’s not a 
one-and-done process; leaders will need to 
continually assess how and when tasks are 
performed, who is performing them, how long tasks 
typically take, and how critical different tasks are. 
Through this process, leaders can better 
understand current and future talent needs and 
determine how best to redeploy and upskill talent. 
Indeed, upskilling programs will take on greater 
importance than ever, as employees will need to 
learn to manage and work with gen AI tools that are 
themselves ever evolving. Leaders should also keep 
in mind that gen AI itself may facilitate the creation 
of content for, and automated or personalized 
delivery of, such upskilling programs.

business isn’t ready for generative AI. 

consumption to ensure the quality of all material 
data, including unstructured data.

Our latest research estimates that generative 
AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to 
$4.4 trillion in annual economic benefits across 
63 use cases.¹ Pull the thread on each of these 
cases, and it will lead back to data. Your data and 
its underlying foundations are the determining 
factors to what’s possible with generative AI. 

That’s a sobering proposition for most chief data 
officers (CDOs), especially when 72 percent of 
leading organizations note that managing data 
is already one of the top challenges preventing 
them from scaling AI use cases.² The challenge 
for today’s CDOs and data leaders is to focus 
on the changes that can enable generative AI to 
generate the greatest value for the business.

The landscape is still rapidly shifting, and there 
are few certain answers. But in our work with 
more than a dozen clients on large generative 
AI data programs, discussions with about 25 
data leaders at major companies, and our own 
experiments in reconfiguring data to power 
generative AI solutions, we have identified seven 
actions that data leaders should consider as they 
move from experimentation to scale: 

1.  Let value be your guide. CDOs need to be 

clear about where the value is and what data 
is needed to deliver it.

2.  Build specific capabilities into the data 

architecture to support the broadest set 
of use cases. Build relevant capabilities 
(such as vector databases and data pre- and 
post-processing pipelines) into the existing 
data architecture, particularly in support of 
unstructured data.

3.  Focus on key points of the data life cycle 
to ensure high quality. Develop multiple 
interventions—both human and automated—
into the data life cycle from source to 

4.  Protect your sensitive data, and be ready to 

move quickly as regulations emerge. Focus on 
securing the enterprise’s proprietary data and 
protecting personal information while actively 
monitoring a fluid regulatory environment. 

5.  Build up data engineering talent. Focus on 

finding the handful of people who are critical to 
implementing your data program, with a shift 
toward more data engineers and fewer data 
scientists.

6.  Use generative AI to help you manage your 

own data. Generative AI can accelerate existing 
tasks and improve how they’re done along the 
entire data value chain, from data engineering to 
data governance and data analysis.

7.  Track rigorously and intervene quickly. Invest 
in performance and financial measurement, and 
closely monitor implementations to continuously 
improve data performance.

1. Let value be your guide
In determining a data strategy for generative 
AI, CDOs might consider adapting a quote from 
President John F. Kennedy: “Ask not what your 
business can do for generative AI; ask what 
generative AI can do for your business.” Focus on 
value is a long-standing principle, but CDOs must 
particularly rely on it to counterbalance the pressure 
to “do something” with generative AI. To provide 
this focus on value, CDOs will need to develop a 
clear view of the data implications of the business’s 
overall approach to generative AI, which will play out 
across three archetypes: 

 — Taker: a business that consumes preexisting 

services through basic interfaces such as APIs. 
In this case, the CDO will need to focus on 
making quality data available for generative AI 
models and subsequently validating the outputs.

1 “The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” McKinsey, June 14, 2023.

 — Shaper: a business that accesses models and 
fine-tunes them on its own data. The CDO 
will need to assess how the business’s data 
management needs to evolve and what changes 
to the data architecture are needed to enable 
the desired outputs. 

 — Maker: a business that builds its own 

foundational models. The CDO will need 
to develop a sophisticated data labeling 
and tagging strategy, as well as make more 
significant investments.

The CDO has the biggest role to play in supporting 
the Shaper approach, since the Maker approach 
is currently limited to only those large companies 
willing to make major investments and the Taker 
approach essentially accesses commoditized 

capabilities. One key function in driving the Shaper 
approach is communicating the trade-offs needed to 
deliver on specific use cases and highlighting those 
that are most feasible. While hyperpersonalization, 
for example, is a promising generative AI use case, it 
requires clean customer data, strong guardrails for 
data protection, and pipelines to access multiple data 
sources. The CDO should also prioritize initiatives that 
can provide the broadest benefits to the business, 
rather than simply support individual use cases.

As CDOs help shape the business’s approach to 
generative AI, it will be important to take a broad 
view on value. As promising as generative AI is, it’s 
just one part of the broader data portfolio (Exhibit 1). 
Much of the potential value to a business comes from 
traditional AI, business intelligence, and machine 
learning (ML). If CDOs find themselves spending

generative AI, that’s a red flag. 

2. Build specific capabilities into 
the data architecture to support the 
broadest set of use cases
The big change when it comes to data is that the 
scope of value has gotten much bigger because 
of generative AI’s ability to work with unstructured 
data, such as chats, videos, and code. This 
represents a significant shift because data 
organizations have traditionally had capabilities 
to work with only structured data, such as data 
in tables. Capturing this value doesn’t require a 
rebuild of the data architecture, but the CDO who 
wants to move beyond the basic Taker archetype 
will need to focus on two clear priorities. 

The first is to fix the data architecture’s 
foundations. While this might sound like old 
news, the cracks in the system a business could 
get away with before will become big problems 
with generative AI. Many of the advantages of 
generative AI will simply not be possible without a 
strong data foundation. To determine the elements 
of the data architecture on which to focus, the 
CDO is best served by identifying the fixes that 
provide the greatest benefit to the widest range 
of use cases, such as data-handling protocols for 
personally identifiable information (PII), since any 
customer-specific generative AI use case will need 
that capability. 

The second priority is to determine which upgrades 
to the data architecture are needed to fulfill the 
requirements of high-value use cases. The key 
issue here is how to cost-effectively manage 
and scale the data and information integrations 
that power generative AI use cases. If they are 
not properly managed, there is a significant 
risk of overstressing the system with massive 
data compute activities, or of teams doing one-
off integrations, which increase complexity 
and technical debt. These issues are further 
complicated by the business’s cloud profile, which 
means CDOs must work closely with IT leadership 
to determine compute, networking, and service 
use costs.

In general, the CDO will need to prioritize the 
implementation of five key components of the 
data architecture as part of the enterprise tech 
stack (Exhibit 2):

 — Unstructured data stores: Large language 

models (LLMs) primarily work with 
unstructured data for most use cases. Data 
leaders will need to map out all unstructured 
data sources and establish metadata tagging 
standards so models can process the data 
and teams can find the data they need. CDOs 
will need to further upgrade the quality of 
data pipelines and establish standards for 
transparency so that it’s easy to track the 
source of an issue to the right data source.

 — Data preprocessing: Most data will 
need to be prepped—for example, by 
converting file formats and cleansing for 
data quality and the handling of sensitive 
data—so that generative AI can use the 
data. Preprocessed data is most often used 
to build prompts for generative AI models. 
To speed up performance, CDOs need to 
standardize the handling of structured and 
unstructured data at scale, such as ways to 
access underlying systems, and prioritize (or 
“preaggregate”) the data that supports the 
most frequent questions and answers.

 — Vector databases: Vectorization is a way to 
prioritize content and create “embeddings” 
(numerical representations of text meanings) 
in order to streamline access to context, the 
complementary information generative AI 
needs to provide accurate answers. Vector 
databases allow generative AI models to 
access just the most relevant information. 
Instead of providing a thousand-page PDF, 
for example, a vector database provides 
only the most relevant pages. In many 
cases, companies don’t need to build vector 
databases to begin working with generative 
AI. They can often use existing NoSQL 
databases to start. 

 — LLM integrations: More-sophisticated 

generative AI uses require interactions with

multiple systems, which creates significant 
challenges in connecting LLMs. Several 
frameworks, many of which are open source, 
can help facilitate these integrations (for 
example, LangChain or various hyperscaler 
offerings, such as Semantic Kernel for Azure, 
Bedrock for AWS, or Vertex AI for Google 
Cloud). CDOs will need to set guidelines 
for choosing which frameworks to use, 
define prompt templates that can be readily 
customized for specific purposes, and establish 
standardized integration patterns for how 
LLMs interface with source data systems.

 — Prompt engineering: Effective prompt 
engineering (the process of structuring 
questions in a way that elicits the best response 
from generative AI models) relies on context. 
Context can be determined only from existing 
data and information across structured and 
unstructured sources. To improve output, CDOs 
will need to manage integration of knowledge 
graphs or data models and ontologies (a set of 
concepts in a domain that shows their properties 
and the relations between them) into the prompt. 
Since CDOs will not have ownership of many 
data repositories across the business, they 

The data dividend: Fueling generative AI

96

need to set standards and prequalify sources 
to ensure the data that is fed into the models 
follows specific protocols (for example, exposing 
a knowledge graph API to easily provide entities 
and relationships).

 — Prompt: Evaluate, measure, and track the 
quality of the prompt. Include high-quality 
metadata and lineage transparency for 
structured and unstructured data in the prompt. 

3. Focus on key points of the data life 
cycle to ensure high quality
Data quality has always been an important issue 
for CDOs. But the scale and scope of data that 
generative AI models rely on has made the “garbage 
in/garbage out” truism much more consequential 
and expensive, as training a single LLM can cost 
millions of dollars.³ One reason pinpointing data 
quality issues is much more difficult in generative 
AI models than in classical ML models is because 
there’s so much more data and much of it is 
unstructured, making it difficult to use existing 
tracking tools.

CDOs need to do two things to ensure data quality: 
extend their data observability programs⁴ for 
generative AI applications to better spot quality 
issues, such as by setting minimum thresholds for 
unstructured content to be included in generative AI 
applications; and develop interventions across the 
data life cycle to fix the issues teams find, mainly in 
four areas:

 — Source data: Expand the data quality 

framework to include measures relevant for 
generative AI purposes (such as bias). Ensure 
high-quality metadata and labels for structured 
and unstructured data, and regulate access 
to sensitive data (for example, base access on 
roles).

 — Preprocessing: Ensure data is consistent 

and standardized and adheres to ontologies 
and established data models. Detect outliers 
and apply normalizations. Automate PII data 
management, and put in place guidelines for 
whether data should be ignored, held, redacted, 
quarantined, removed, masked, or synthesized.

 — Output from LLM: Establish the necessary 

governance procedures to identify and resolve 
incorrect outputs, and use “human in the loop” 
to review and triage output issues. Ultimately, 
elevate the role of individual employees by 
training them to critically evaluate model 
outputs and be aware of the quality of 
input data. Supplement with an automated 
monitoring-and-alert capability to identify 
rogue behaviors.

4. Protect your sensitive data, and be 
ready to move quickly as regulations 
emerge
Some 71 percent of senior IT leaders believe 
generative AI technology is introducing new 
security risk to their data.⁵ Much has been 
written about security and risk when it comes to 
generative AI, but CDOs needs to consider the 
data implications in three specific areas: 

 — Identify and prioritize security risks to the 
enterprise‘s proprietary data. CDOs need 
to assess the broad risks associated with 
exposing the business’s data, such as the 
potential exposure of trade secrets when 
confidential and proprietary code is shared 
with generative AI models, and prioritize 
the greatest threats. Much existing data 
protection and cybersecurity governance can 
be extended to address specific generative 
AI risks—for example, by adding pop-up 
reminders whenever an engineer wants 
to share data with a model or by running 
automated scripts to ensure compliance. 

 — Manage access to PII data. CDOs need to 
regulate how data is detected and treated 
in the context of generative AI. They need to

5 “Top generative AI statistics for 2023,” Salesforce, September 2023.

The data dividend: Fueling generative AI

97

set up systems that incorporate protection 
tools and human interventions to ensure PII 
data is removed during data preprocessing 
and before it’s used on an LLM. Using 
synthetic data (through data fabricators) and 
nonsensitive identifiers can help. 

 — Track the expected surge of regulations 

closely. Generative AI has acted as a catalyst 
to rapid movement among governments to 
enact new regulations, such as the European 
Union’s AI Act, which is setting a wide array 
of new standards, such as having companies 
publish summaries of copyrighted data 
used for training an LLM. Data leaders must 
stay close to the business’s risk leaders 
to understand new regulations and their 
implications for data strategy, such as the 
need to “untrain” models that use regulated 
data. 

5. Build up data engineering talent
As enterprises increasingly adopt generative 
AI, CDOs will have to focus on the implications 
for talent. Some coding tasks will be done by 
generative AI tools—41 percent of code published 
on GitHub is written by AI.⁶ This requires 
specific training on working with a generative AI 
“copilot”—a recent McKinsey study showed that 
senior engineers work more productively with a 
generative AI copilot than do junior engineers.⁷ 
Data and AI academies need to incorporate 
generative AI training tailored to specific 
expertise levels.

CDOs will also need to be clear about what skills 
best enable generative AI. Companies need 
people who can integrate data sets (such as 
writing APIs connecting models to data sources), 
sequence and chain prompts, wrangle large 
quantities of data, apply LLMs, and work with 
model parameters. This means that CDOs should 
focus more on finding data engineers, architects, 
and back-end engineers, and less on hiring 

data scientists, whose skills will be increasingly 
less critical as generative AI allows people with 
less advanced technical capabilities to use natural 
language in doing basic analysis. 

In the near term, talent will remain in shorter supply, 
and we project that the talent gap will increase 
further in the near future,⁸ creating more incentives 
for CDOs to build up their training programs.

6. Use generative AI to help you 
manage your own data
Data leaders have a huge opportunity to harness 
generative AI to improve their own function. In our 
analysis, eight primary use cases have emerged 
along the entire data value chain where generative 
AI can both accelerate existing tasks and improve 
how tasks are performed (Exhibit 3).

Many vendors are already rolling out products, 
requiring CDOs to identify the capabilities for which 
they can rely on vendors and which they should 
build themselves. One rule of thumb is that for 
data governance processes that are unique to the 
business, it’s better to build your own tool. Note that 
many tools and capabilities are new and may work 
well in experimental environments but not at scale.

7. Track rigorously and intervene 
quickly
There are more unknowns than knowns in the 
generative AI world today, and companies are still 
learning their way forward. It is therefore crucial 
for CDOs to set up systems to actively track and 
manage progress on their generative AI initiatives 
and to understand how well data is performing in 
supporting the business’s goals. 

In practice, effective metrics are made up of a set 
of core KPIs and operational KPIs (the underlying 
activities that drive KPIs), which help leaders track 
progress and identify root causes of issues.

A core set of KPIs should include the following:

— cost of additional components, such as vector 
databases and consumption of LLMs as a 
service 

Operational KPIs should include tracking which data 
is being used most, how models are performing, 
where data quality is poor, how many requests are 
being made against a given dataset, and which use 
cases are generating the most activity and value.

— additional revenue that is enabled by the 
integration of specific data sources with 
generative AI application workflows

— time-to-market to develop a generative AI–
powered application that requires access to 
internal data

— end-user satisfaction with how the data has 
improved the performance and quality of the 
application

This information is critical in providing a fact base for 
leadership to not just track progress but also make 
rapid adjustments and trade-off decisions against 
other initiatives in the CDO’s broader portfolio. By 
knowing which data sources are most used for high-
value models, for example, the CDO can prioritize 
investments to improve data quality at those 
sources.

The data dividend: Fueling generative AI

99

Effective investment, budgeting, and reallocation 
will depend on CDOs developing a FinOps-
like capability to manage the entire new cost 
structure growing around generative AI. CDOs 
will need to track a new range of costs, including 
the number of generative AI model requests, 
API consumption charges from vendors (both 
quantity and size of calls), and compute and 
storage charges from cloud providers. With this 
information, the CDO can determine how best 
to optimize costs, such as routing requests by 
priority level or moving certain data to the cloud 
to cut down on networking costs.

The value of these metrics is only as great as the 
degree to which CDOs act on them. CDOs will 

need to establish data-performance metrics that 
can be reviewed in near real time and protocols to 
make rapid decisions. Effective data governance 
programs should remain in place but be extended 
to incorporate generative AI–related decisions. 

Data cannot be an afterthought in generative AI. 
Rather, it is the core fuel that powers the ability 
of a business to capture value from generative 
AI. But businesses that want that value cannot 
afford CDOs who merely manage data; they need 
CDOs who understand how to use data to lead 
the business.

Hardly a day goes by without some new 
business-busting development related to 
generative AI surfacing in the media. The 
excitement is well deserved—McKinsey research 
estimates that generative AI could add the 
equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion of value 
annually.¹ 

CIOs and chief technology officers (CTOs) have a 
critical role in capturing that value, but it’s worth 
remembering we’ve seen this movie before. New 
technologies emerged—the internet, mobile, 
social media—that set off a melee of experiments 
and pilots, though significant business value 
often proved harder to come by. Many of the 
lessons learned from those developments still 
apply, especially when it comes to getting past 
the pilot stage to reach scale. For the CIO and 
CTO, the generative AI boom presents a unique 
opportunity to apply those lessons to guide the 
C-suite in turning the promise of generative AI 
into sustainable value for the business.

Through conversations with dozens of tech 
leaders and an analysis of generative AI initiatives 
at more than 50 companies (including our own), 
we have identified nine actions all technology 
leaders can take to create value, orchestrate 
technology and data, scale solutions, and 
manage risk for generative AI: 

1.  Move quickly to determine the company’s 
posture for the adoption of generative AI, 
and develop practical communications to, and 
appropriate access for, employees. 

2.  Reimagine the business and identify use 

cases that build value through improved 
productivity, growth, and new business 
models. Develop a “financial AI” (FinAI) 
capability that can estimate the true costs 
and returns of generative AI.

3.  Reimagine the technology function, 

and focus on quickly building generative 
AI capabilities in software development, 
accelerating technical debt reduction, and 
dramatically reducing manual effort in IT 
operations.

4.  Take advantage of existing services or 

adapt open-source generative AI models to 
develop proprietary capabilities (building and 
operating your own generative AI models can 
cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, at 
least in the near term).

5.  Upgrade your enterprise technology 

architecture to integrate and manage 
generative AI models and orchestrate how 
they operate with each other and existing 
AI and machine learning (ML) models, 
applications, and data sources.

6.  Develop a data architecture to enable 

access   to quality data by processing both 
structured and unstructured data sources.

7.  Create a centralized, cross-functional    
generative AI platform team to provide 
approved models to product and application 
teams on demand.

8.  Invest in upskilling key roles—software 
developers, data engineers, MLOps 
engineers, and security experts—as well as 
the broader nontech workforce. But you need 
to tailor the training programs by roles and 
proficiency levels due to the varying impact 
of generative AI.

9.  Evaluate the new risk landscape  and 

establish ongoing mitigation practices to 
address models, data, and policies.

1  “The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” McKinsey, June 14, 2023.

Technology’s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide

102102

1. Determine the company’s posture for 
the adoption of generative AI
As use of generative AI becomes increasingly 
widespread, we have seen CIOs and CTOs respond 
by blocking employee access to publicly available 
applications to limit risk. In doing so, these 
companies risk missing out on opportunities for 
innovation, with some employees even perceiving 
these moves as limiting their ability to build 
important new skills. 

Instead, CIOs and CTOs should work with risk 
leaders to balance the real need for risk mitigation 
with the importance of building generative AI 
skills in the business. This requires establishing 
the company’s posture regarding generative AI 
by building consensus around the levels of risk 
with which the business is comfortable and how 
generative AI fits into the business’s overall strategy. 
This step allows the business to quickly determine 
company-wide policies and guidelines. 

Once policies are clearly defined, leaders should 
communicate them to the business, with the CIO 
and CTO providing the organization with appropriate 
access and user-friendly guidelines. Some 
companies have rolled out firmwide communications 
about generative AI, provided broad access to 
generative AI for specific user groups, created pop-
ups that warn users any time they input internal 
data into a model, and built a guidelines page that 
appears each time users access a publicly available 
generative AI service. 

2. Identify use cases that build value 
through improved productivity, 
growth, and new business models
CIOs and CTOs should be the antidote to the “death 
by use case” frenzy that we already see in many 
companies. They can be most helpful by working 
with the CEO, CFO, and other business leaders 
to think through how generative AI challenges 

existing business models, opens doors to new 
ones, and creates new sources of value. With a 
deep understanding of the technical possibilities, 
the CIO and CTO should identify the most valuable 
opportunities and issues across the company that 
can benefit from generative AI—and those that can’t. 
In some cases, generative AI is not the best option. 

McKinsey research, for example, shows generative 
AI can lift productivity for certain marketing use 
cases (for example, by analyzing unstructured and 
abstract data for customer preference) by roughly 
10 percent and customer support (for example, 
through intelligent bots) by up to 40 percent.²  
The CIO and CTO can be particularly helpful in 
developing a perspective on how best to cluster use 
cases either by domain (such as customer journey or 
business process) or use case type (such as creative 
content creation or virtual agents) so that generative 
AI will have the most value. Identifying opportunities 
won’t be the most strategic task—there are many 
generative AI use cases out there—but, given initial 
limitations of talent and capabilities, the CIO and 
CTO will need to provide feasibility and resource 
estimates to help the business sequence generative 
AI priorities.

Providing this level of counsel requires tech leaders 
to work with the business to develop a FinAI 
capability to estimate the true costs and returns on 
generative AI initiatives. Cost calculations can be 
particularly complex because the unit economics 
must account for multiple model and vendor costs, 
model interactions (where a query might require 
input from multiple models, each with its own fee), 
ongoing usage fees, and human oversight costs. 

3. Reimagine the technology function 
Generative AI has the potential to completely 
remake how the tech function works. CIOs and 
CTOs need to make a comprehensive review of the 
potential impact of generative AI on all areas of tech,

but it’s important to take action quickly to build 
experience and expertise. There are three areas 
where they can focus their initial energies: 

developing documentation, such as standard 
operating procedures, incident postmortems, 
or performance reports.

 — Software development: McKinsey research 
shows generative AI coding support can help 
software engineers develop code 35 to 45 
percent faster, refactor code 20 to 30 percent 
faster, and perform code documentation 45 
to 50 percent faster.³ Generative AI can also 
automate the testing process and simulate 
edge cases, allowing teams to develop 
more-resilient software prior to release, and 
accelerate the onboarding of new developers 
(for example, by asking generative AI questions 
about a code base). Capturing these benefits 
will require extensive training (see more in 
action 8) and automation of integration and 
deployment pipelines through DevSecOps 
practices to manage the surge in code volume.

 — Technical debt: Technical debt can account for 
20 to 40 percent of technology budgets and 
significantly slow the pace of development.⁴ 
CIOs and CTOs should review their tech-debt 
balance sheets to determine how generative 
AI capabilities such as code refactoring, 
code translation, and automated test-case 
generation can accelerate the reduction of 
technical debt. 

 — IT operations (ITOps): CIOs and CTOs will 

need to review their ITOps productivity efforts 
to determine how generative AI can accelerate 
processes. Generative AI’s capabilities are 
particularly helpful in automating such tasks 
as password resets, status requests, or 
basic diagnostics through self-serve agents; 
accelerating triage and resolution through 
improved routing; surfacing useful context, 
such as topic or priority, and generating 
suggested responses; improving observability 
through analysis of vast streams of logs to 
identify events that truly require attention; and 

4. Take advantage of existing services 
or adapt open-source generative AI 
models 
A variation of the classic “rent, buy, or build” 
decision exists when it comes to strategies for 
developing generative AI capabilities. The basic 
rule holds true: a company should invest in a 
generative AI capability where it can create a 
proprietary advantage for the business and access 
existing services for those that are more like 
commodities.

The CIO and CTO can think through the implications 
of these options as three archetypes:

 — Taker—uses publicly available models through 
a chat interface or an API, with little or no 
customization. Good examples include off-
the-shelf solutions to generate code (such 
as GitHub Copilot) or to assist designers with 
image generation and editing (such as Adobe 
Firefly). This is the simplest archetype in 
terms of both engineering and infrastructure 
needs and is generally the fastest to get up 
and running. These models are essentially 
commodities that rely on feeding data in the 
form of prompts to the public model.

 — Shaper—integrates models with internal data 
and systems to generate more customized 
results. One example is a model that supports 
sales deals by connecting generative AI 
tools to customer relationship management 
(CRM) and financial systems to incorporate 
customers’ prior sales and engagement 
history. Another is fine-tuning the model with 
internal company documents and chat history 
to act as an assistant to a customer support 
agent. For companies that are looking to

scale generative AI capabilities, develop more 
proprietary capabilities, or meet higher security 
or compliance needs, the Shaper archetype is 
appropriate.  

There are two common approaches for 
integrating data with generative AI models in 
this archetype. One is to “bring the model to 
the data,” where the model is hosted on the 
organization’s infrastructure, either on-premises 
or in the cloud environment. Cohere, for example, 
deploys foundation models on clients’ cloud 
infrastructure, reducing the need for data 
transfers. The other approach is to “bring 
data to the model,” where an organization can 
aggregate its data and deploy a copy of the large 
model on cloud infrastructure. Both approaches 
achieve the goal of providing access to the 
foundation models, and choosing between them 
will come down to the organization’s workload 
footprint.

 — Maker—builds a foundation model to address 

a discrete business case. Building a foundation 
model is expensive and complex, requiring 
huge volumes of data, deep expertise, and 
massive compute power. This option requires 
a substantial one-off investment—tens or 
even hundreds of millions of dollars—to build 
the model and train it. The cost depends on 
various factors, such as training infrastructure, 
model architecture choice, number of model 
parameters, data size, and expert resources.

Each archetype has its own costs that tech 
leaders will need to consider (Exhibit 1). While new 
developments, such as efficient model training 
approaches and lower graphics processing unit 
(GPU) compute costs over time, are driving costs 
down, the inherent complexity of the Maker 
archetype means that few organizations will adopt 
it in the short term. Instead, most will turn to some 
combination of Taker, to quickly access a commodity 
service, and Shaper, to build a proprietary capability 
on top of foundation models.

5. Upgrade your enterprise technology 
architecture to integrate and manage 
generative AI models
Organizations will use many generative AI models 
of varying size, complexity, and capability. To 
generate value, these models need to be able to 
work both together and with the business’s existing 
systems or applications. For this reason, building a 
separate tech stack for generative AI creates more 
complexities than it solves. As an example, we can 
look at a consumer querying customer service at a 
travel company to resolve a booking issue (Exhibit 
2). In interacting with the customer, the generative 
AI model needs to access multiple applications and 
data sources.

For the Taker archetype, this level of coordination 
isn’t necessary. But for companies looking to 
scale the advantages of generative AI as Shapers 
or Makers, CIOs and CTOs need to upgrade their 
technology architecture. The prime goal is to 
integrate generative AI models into internal systems 
and enterprise applications and to build pipelines to 
various data sources. Ultimately, it’s the maturity of 
the business’s enterprise technology architecture 
that allows it to integrate and scale its generative AI 
capabilities. 

Recent advances in integration and orchestration 
frameworks, such as LangChain and LlamaIndex, 
have significantly reduced the effort required to 
connect different generative AI models with other 
applications and data sources. Several integration 
patterns are also emerging, including those that 
enable models to call APIs when responding to 
a user query—GPT-4, for example, can invoke 
functions—and provide contextual data from an 
external dataset as part of a user query, a technique 
known as retrieval augmented generation. Tech 
leaders will need to define reference architectures 
and standard integration patterns for their 
organization (such as standard API formats and 
parameters that identify the user and the model 
invoking the API).

There are five key elements that need to be 
incorporated into the technology architecture to 
integrate generative AI effectively (Exhibit 3): 

 — Context management and caching to 

provide models with relevant information from 
enterprise data sources. Access to relevant 
data at the right time is what allows the model to 
understand the context and produce compelling 
outputs. Caching stores results to frequently 
asked questions to enable faster and cheaper 
responses. 

 — Policy management to ensure appropriate 

access to enterprise data assets. This control 
ensures that HR’s generative AI models that 
include employee compensation details, for 
example, cannot be accessed by the rest of the 
organization.

 — Model hub, which contains trained and 

approved models that can be provisioned on 
demand and acts as a repository for model 
checkpoints, weights, and parameters.

 — Prompt library, which contains optimized 
instructions for the generative AI models, 
including prompt versioning as models are 
updated. 

 — MLOps platform, including upgraded MLOps 
capabilities, to account for the complexity of 
generative AI models. MLOps pipelines, for 
example, will need to include instrumentation 
to measure task-specific performance, such as 
measuring a model’s ability to retrieve the right 
knowledge.

In evolving the architecture, CIOs and CTOs will 
need to navigate a rapidly growing ecosystem of 
generative AI providers and tooling. Cloud providers 
provide extensive access to at-scale hardware 
and foundation models, as well as a proliferating 
set of services. MLOps and model hub providers, 
meanwhile, offer the tools, technologies, and 
practices to adapt a foundation model and deploy 
it into production, while other companies provide 
applications directly accessed by users built on 

top of foundation models to perform specific 
tasks. CIOs and CTOs will need to assess how 
these various capabilities are assembled and 
integrated to deploy and operate generative AI 
models. 

6. Develop a data architecture to 
enable access to quality data
The ability of a business to generate and 
scale value, including cost reductions and 
improved data and knowledge protections, from 
generative AI models will depend on how well it 
takes advantage of its own data. Creating that 
advantage relies on a data architecture that 
connects generative AI models to internal data 
sources, which provide context or help fine-tune 
the models to create more relevant outputs.

In this context, CIOs, CTOs, and chief data 
officers need to work closely together to do the 
following: 

 — Categorize and organize data so it can be 

used by generative AI models. Tech leaders 
will need to develop a comprehensive 
data architecture that encompasses both 
structured and unstructured data sources. 
This requires putting in place standards and 
guidelines to optimize data for generative AI 
use—for example, by augmenting training 
data with synthetic samples to improve 
diversity and size; converting media types 
into standardized data formats; adding 
metadata to improve traceability and data 
quality; and updating data.

 — Ensure existing infrastructure or cloud 
services can support the storage and 
handling of the vast volumes of data needed 
for generative AI applications. 

 — Prioritize the development of data pipelines 
to connect generative AI models to relevant 
data sources that provide “contextual 
understanding.” Emerging approaches 
include the use of vector databases to store 
and retrieve embeddings (specially formatted

knowledge) as input for generative AI models as 
well as in-context learning approaches, such as 
“few shot prompting,” where models are provided 
with examples of good answers.

7. Create a centralized, cross-functional 
generative AI platform team
Most tech organizations are on a journey to a 
product and platform operating model. CIOs and 
CTOs need to integrate generative AI capabilities 
into this operating model to build on the existing 
infrastructure and help to rapidly scale adoption 
of generative AI. The first step is setting up a 
generative AI platform team whose core focus is 
developing and maintaining a platform service 
where approved generative AI models can be 
provisioned on demand for use by product and 
application teams. The platform team also defines 
protocols for how generative AI models integrate 
with internal systems, enterprise applications, 
and tools, and also develops and implements 
standardized approaches to manage risk, such as 
responsible AI frameworks.

CIOs and CTOs need to ensure that the platform 
team is staffed with people who have the right 
skills. This team requires a senior technical leader 
who acts as the general manager. Key roles include 
software engineers to integrate generative AI 
models into existing systems, applications, and 
tools; data engineers to build pipelines that 
connect models to various systems of record and 
data sources; data scientists to select models and 
engineer prompts; MLOps engineers to manage 
deployment and monitoring of multiple models and 
model versions; ML engineers to fine-tune models 
with new data sources; and risk experts to manage 
security issues such as data leakage, access 
controls, output accuracy, and bias. The exact 
composition of the platform team will depend on 
the use cases being served across the enterprise. In 
some instances, such as creating a customer-facing 
chatbot, strong product management and user 
experience (UX) resources will be required. 

Realistically, the platform team will need to work 
initially on a narrow set of priority use cases, 
gradually expanding the scope of their work as they 
build reusable capabilities and learn what works 
best. Technology leaders should work closely with 
business leads to evaluate which business cases to 
fund and support. 

8. Tailor upskilling programs by roles 
and proficiency levels
Generative AI has the potential to massively 
lift employees’ productivity and augment their 
capabilities. But the benefits are unevenly 
distributed depending on roles and skill levels, 
requiring leaders to rethink how to build the actual 
skills people need. 

Our latest empirical research using the generative 
AI tool GitHub Copilot, for example, helped software 
engineers write code 35 to 45 percent faster.⁵ The 
benefits, however, varied. Highly skilled developers 
saw gains of up to 50 to 80 percent, while junior 
developers experienced a 7 to 10 percent decline in 
speed. That’s because the output of the generative 
AI tools requires engineers to critique, validate, 
and improve the code, which inexperienced 
software engineers struggle to do. Conversely, in 
less technical roles, such as customer service, 
generative AI helps low-skill workers significantly, 
with productivity increasing by 14 percent and staff 
turnover dropping as well, according to one study.⁶  

These disparities underscore the need for 
technology leaders, working with the chief human 
resources officer (CHRO), to rethink their talent 
management strategy to build the workforce of the 
future. Hiring a core set of top generative AI talent 
will be important, and, given the increasing scarcity 
and strategic importance of that talent, tech leaders 
should put in place retention mechanisms, such 
as competitive salaries and opportunities to be 
involved in important strategic work for the business.

Tech leaders, however, cannot stop at hiring. 
Because nearly every existing role will be affected 

5  “Unleashing developer productivity with generative AI,” McKinsey, June 27, 2023.

Technology’s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide

110110

by generative AI, a crucial focus should be on 
upskilling people based on a clear view of what 
skills are needed by role, proficiency level, and 
business goals. Let’s look at software developers 
as an example. Training for novices needs to 
emphasize accelerating their path to become top 
code reviewers in addition to code generators. 
Similar to the difference between writing and 
editing, code review requires a different skill set. 
Software engineers will need to understand what 
good code looks like; review the code created 
by generative AI for functionality, complexity, 
quality, and readability; and scan for vulnerabilities 
while ensuring they do not themselves introduce 
quality or security issues in the code. Furthermore, 
software developers will need to learn to think 
differently when it comes to coding, by better 
understanding user intent so they can create 
prompts and define contextual data that help 
generative AI tools provide better answers.

Beyond training up tech talent, the CIO and CTO 
can play an important role in building generative 
AI skills among nontech talent as well. Besides 
understanding how to use generative AI tools for 
such basic tasks as email generation and task 
management, people across the business will 
need to become comfortable using an array of 
capabilities to improve performance and outputs. 
The CIO and CTO can help adapt academy models 
to provide this training and corresponding 
certifications. 

The decreasing value of inexperienced engineers 
should accelerate the move away from a classic 
talent pyramid, where the greatest number of 
people are at a junior level, to a structure more 
like a diamond, where the bulk of the technical 
workforce is made up of experienced people. 
Practically speaking, that will mean building the 
skills of junior employees as quickly as possible 
while reducing roles dedicated to low-complexity 
manual tasks (such as writing unit tests).

9. Evaluate the new risk landscape 
and establish ongoing mitigation 
practices 
Generative AI presents a fresh set of ethical 
questions and risks, including “hallucinations,” 
whereby the generative AI model presents 
an incorrect response based on the highest-
probability response; the accidental release of 
confidential personally identifiable information; 
inherent bias in the large datasets the models 
use; and high degrees of uncertainty related to 
intellectual property (IP). CIOs and CTOs will need 
to become fluent in ethics, humanitarian, and 
compliance issues to adhere not just to the letter 
of the law (which will vary by country) but also to 
the spirit of responsibly managing their business’s 
reputation.

Addressing this new landscape requires a 
significant review of cyber practices and updating 
the software development process to evaluate 
risk and identify mitigation actions before model 
development begins, which will both reduce 
issues and ensure the process doesn’t slow down. 
Proven risk-mitigation actions for hallucinations 
can include adjusting the level of creativity 
(known as the “temperature”) of a model when it 
generates responses; augmenting the model with 
relevant internal data to provide more context; 
using libraries that impose guardrails on what 
can be generated; using “moderation” models 
to check outputs; and adding clear disclaimers. 
Early generative AI use cases should focus on 
areas where the cost of error is low, to allow the 
organization to work through inevitable setbacks 
and incorporate learnings.

To protect data privacy, it will be critical to 
establish and enforce sensitive data tagging 
protocols, set up data access controls in different 
domains (such as HR compensation data), add 
extra protection when data is used externally,

and include privacy safeguards. For example, to 
mitigate access control risk, some organizations 
have set up a policy-management layer that 
restricts access by role once a prompt is given to 
the model. To mitigate risk to intellectual property, 
CIOs and CTOs should insist that providers 
of foundation models maintain transparency 
regarding the IP (data sources, licensing, and 
ownership rights) of the datasets used.  

Generative AI is poised to be one of the fastest-
growing technology categories we’ve ever seen. 
Tech leaders cannot afford unnecessary delays 
in defining and shaping a generative AI strategy. 
While the space will continue to evolve rapidly, 
these nine actions can help CIOs and CTOs 
responsibly and effectively harness the power of 
generative AI at scale.

Risk & Resilience Practice

As gen AI advances, 
regulators—and risk 
functions—rush to keep pace 

AI and its supercharged breakthrough, generative AI, are all about rapid 
advancements, and rule makers are under pressure to keep up.

The rapid advancement of generative AI (gen 
AI) has regulators around the world racing to 
understand, control, and guarantee the safety of 
the technology—all while preserving its potential 
benefits. Across industries, gen AI adoption 
has presented a new challenge for risk and 
compliance functions: how to balance use of this 
new technology amid an evolving—and uneven—
regulatory framework.

how the technology’s models and systems are 
developed and how the technology is used.

Generally, there are concerns about a potential 
lack of transparency in the functioning of gen AI 
systems, the data used to train them, issues of 
bias and fairness, potential intellectual property 
infringements, possible privacy violations, third-
party risk, as well as security concerns.

As governments and regulators try to define what 
such a control environment should look like, the 
developing approaches are fragmented and often 
misaligned, making it difficult for organizations to 
navigate and causing substantial uncertainty.

In this article, we explain the risks of AI and gen 
AI and why the technology has drawn regulatory 
scrutiny. We also offer a strategic road map to help 
risk functions navigate the uneven and changing 
rule-making landscape—which is focused not only 
on gen AI but all artificial intelligence.

Why does gen AI need regulation?
AI’s breakthrough advancement, gen AI, has 
quickly captured the interest of the public, with 
ChatGPT becoming one of the fastest-growing 
platforms ever, reaching one million users in just 
five days. The acceleration comes as no surprise 
given the wide range of gen AI use cases, which 
promise increased productivity, expedited access 
to knowledge, and an expected total economic 
impact of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually.¹

There is, however, an economic incentive to 
getting AI and gen AI adoption right. Companies 
developing these systems may face consequences 
if the platforms they develop are not sufficiently 
polished. And a misstep can be costly. Major gen 
AI companies, for example, have lost significant 
market value when their platforms were found 
hallucinating (when AI generates false or illogical 
information).

The proliferation of gen AI has increased the 
visibility of risks. Key gen AI concerns include 

Add disinformation to these concerns, such as 
erroneous or manipulated output and harmful or 
malicious content, and it is no wonder regulators 
are seeking to mitigate potential harms. Regulators 
seek to establish legal certainty for companies 
engaged in the development or use of gen AI. 
Meanwhile, rule makers want to encourage 
innovation without fear of unknown repercussions.

The goal is to establish harmonized international 
regulatory standards that would stimulate 
international trade and data transfers. In pursuit 
of this goal, a consensus has been reached: the 
gen AI development community has been at the 
forefront of advocating for some regulatory control 
over the technology’s development as soon as 
possible. The question at hand is not whether to 
proceed with regulations, but rather how.

The current international regulatory 
landscape for AI
While no country has passed comprehensive AI 
or gen AI regulation to date, leading legislative 
efforts include those in Brazil, China, the European 
Union, Singapore, South Korea, and the United 
States. The approaches taken by the different 
countries vary from broad AI regulation supported 
by existing data protection and cybersecurity 
regulations (the European Union and South Korea) 
to sector-specific laws (the United States) and 
more general principles or guidelines-based 
approaches (Brazil, Singapore, and the United 
States). Each approach has its own benefits and 
drawbacks, and some markets will move from 
principles-based guidelines to strict legislation 
over time (Exhibit 1).

While the approaches vary, common themes in the 
regulatory landscape have emerged globally:

failures to meet these criteria, and they should 
be resilient against attempts to manipulate the 
system by malicious third parties.

 — Transparency. Regulators are seeking traceability 
and clarity of AI output. Their goal is to ensure 
that users are informed when they engage 
with any AI system and to provide them with 
information about their rights and about the 
capabilities and limitations of the system.

 — Diversity, nondiscrimination, and fairness. 

Another goal for regulators is to ensure that AI 
systems are free of bias and that the output 
does not result in discrimination or unfair 
treatment of people.

 — Human agency and oversight. Ideally, AI 

systems should be developed and used as tools 
that serve people, uphold human dignity and 
personal autonomy, and function in a way that 
can be appropriately controlled and overseen by 
humans.

 — Privacy and data governance. Regulators want 
to see development and usage of AI systems 
that follow existing privacy and data protection 
rules while processing data that meets high 
standards in quality and integrity.

 — Accountability. Regulators want to see 
mechanisms that ensure awareness of 
responsibilities, accountability, and potential 
redress regarding AI systems. In practice, 
they are seeking top management buy-in, 
organization-wide education, and awareness of 
individual responsibility.

 — Technical robustness and safety. Rule makers are 
seeking to minimize unintended and unexpected 
harm by ensuring that AI systems are robust, 
meaning they operate as expected, remain stable, 
and can rectify user errors. They should have 
fallback solutions and remediation to address any 

 — Social and environmental well-being. There is a 
strong desire to ensure that all AI is sustainable, 
environmentally friendly (for instance, in its 
energy use), and beneficial to all people, with 
ongoing monitoring and assessing of the 
long-term effects on individuals, society, and 

democracy.

Despite some commonality in the guiding principles 
of AI, the implementation and exact wording vary by 
regulator and region. Many rules are still new and, 
thus, prone to frequent updates (Exhibit 2). This 
makes it challenging for organizations to navigate 
regulations while planning long-term AI strategies.

What does this mean for organizations?
Organizations may be tempted to wait to see what 
AI regulations emerge. But the time to act is now. 
Organizations may face large legal, reputational, 
organizational, and financial risks if they do not act 
swiftly. Several markets, including Italy, have already 
banned ChatGPT because of privacy concerns, 
copyright infringement lawsuits brought by multiple 
organizations and individuals, and defamation 
lawsuits.

More speed bumps are likely. As the negative 
effects of AI become more widely known and 
publicized, public concerns increase. This, in turn, 
has led to public distrust of the companies creating 
or using AI.

A misstep at this stage could also be costly. 
Organizations could face fines from legal 
enforcement—of up to 7 percent of annual global 
revenues, according to the AI regulation proposed 
by the European Union, for example. Another threat 
is financial loss from falloff in customer or investor 
trust that could translate into a lower stock price, 
loss of customers, or slower customer acquisition. 
The incentive to move fast is heightened by the 
fact that if the right governance and organizational 
models for AI are not built early, remediation may 
become necessary later due to regulatory changes, 
data breaches, or cybersecurity incidents. Fixing 
a system after the fact can be both expensive 
and difficult to implement consistently across the 
organization.

The exact future of legal obligations is still unclear 
and may differ across geographies and depend 

on the specific role AI will play within the value 
chain. Still, there are some no-regret moves for 
organizations, which can be implemented today 
to get ahead of looming legal changes.

These preemptive actions can be grouped into 
four key areas that stem from existing data 
protection or privacy and cyber efforts, as they 
share a great deal of common ground:

Transparency. Create a taxonomy and inventory 
of models, classifying them in accordance with 
regulation, and record all usage across the 
organization in a central repository that is clear 
to those inside and outside the organization. 
Create detailed documentation of AI and gen 
AI usage, both internally and externally, its 
functioning, risks, and controls, and create clear 
documentation on how a model was developed, 
what risks it may have, and how it is intended to 
be used.

Governance. Implement a governance structure 
for AI and gen AI that ensures sufficient oversight, 
authority, and accountability both within the 
organization and with third parties and regulators. 
This approach should include a definition of 
all roles and responsibilities in AI and gen AI 
management and the development of an incident 
management plan to address any issues that may 
arise from AI and gen AI use. The governance 
structure should be robust enough to withstand 
changes in personnel and time but also agile 
enough to adapt to evolving technology, business 
priorities, and regulatory requirements.

Organizations are challenged with 
navigating varied regulations while 
planning their long-term AI strategies. 

As gen AI advances, regulators—and risk functions—rush to keep pace

117

Data, model, and technology management. AI 
and gen AI both require robust data, model, and 
technology management:

 — Data management. Data is the foundation of 
all AI and gen AI models. The quality of the 
data input also mirrors the final output of the 
model. Proper and reliable data management 
includes awareness of data sources, data 
classification, data quality and lineage, 
intellectual property, and privacy management.

 — Model management. Organizations can 

establish robust principles and guardrails 
for AI and gen AI development and use them 
to minimize the organization’s risks and 
ensure that all AI and gen AI models uphold 
fairness and bias controls, proper functioning, 
transparency, clarity, and enablement of 
human oversight. Train the entire organization 
on the proper use and development of AI and 
gen AI to ensure risks are minimized. Develop 
the organization’s risk taxonomy and risk 
framework to include the risks associated with 
gen AI. Establish roles and responsibilities 
in risk management and establish risk 
assessments and controls, with proper testing 
and monitoring mechanisms to monitor and 
resolve AI and gen AI risks. Both data and 
model management require agile and iterative 
processes and should not be treated as simple 
tick-the-box exercises at the beginning of 
development projects.

 — Cybersecurity and technology management. 

Establish strong cybersecurity and technology, 
including access control, firewalls, logs, 
monitoring, et cetera, to ensure a secure 
technology environment, where unauthorized 
access or misuse is prevented and potential 
incidents are identified early.

Individual rights. Educate users: make them aware 
that they are interacting with an AI system, and 
provide clear instructions for use. This should 
include establishing a point of contact that 
provides transparency and enables users to 
exercise their rights, such as how to access data, 
how models work, and how to opt out. Finally, 
take a customer-centric approach to designing 
and using AI, one that considers the ethical 
implications of the data used and its potential 
impact on customers. Since not everything legal is 
necessarily ethical, it is important to prioritize the 
ethical considerations of AI usage.

AI and gen AI will continue to have a significant 
impact on many organizations, whether 
they are providers of AI models or users of 
AI systems. Despite the rapidly changing 
regulatory landscape, which is not yet aligned 
across geographies and sectors and may feel 
unpredictable, there are tangible benefits for 
organizations that improve how they provide and 
use AI now.

Six major gen AI trends that 
will shape 2024’s agenda

What every CEO needs to know and what it means for their gen AI agendas.

It’s hard to believe that ChatGPT is only a year 
old. The number of exciting new product launches 
over the past 12 months has been astonishing—
and there’s no sign that things will slow down 
anytime soon. In fact, quite the opposite. Earlier 
in November, OpenAI hosted DevDay, where the 
company announced extensive offerings across 
B2C and B2B markets. Cohere has doubled 
down on its knowledge search capabilities and 
private deployments. And Amazon Web Services 
launched PartyRock, its no-code gen AI app-
building playground.

We believe that this past month’s activity is 
setting the stage for what to expect in 2024 
in the gen AI space. Here are six major trends 
happening across the space.

1.  Gen AI can see, hear, and talk. Multimodal 

models spanning text, code, image, and audio 
unlock new capabilities across both content 
generation and comprehension.

2.  Gen AI can interact with the world. Gen AI 
models connect to data and IT systems to 
read and write data.

3.  Gen AI models are easier to control. End 
users get more consistent outputs from 
probabilistic models via new features (for 
example, setting the seed).

4.  Gen AI development is being democratized. 
OpenAI announced a new product called 
“GPTs,” which allow nearly anyone to build a 
gen-AI-powered chatbot using low code/no 
code interfaces.

5.  Gen AI is a platform play. Entire 

While the technology’s possibilities continue to 
grow, we believe there are four principles for CEOs 
to consider as they drive their gen AI agendas. The 
principles draw from our experiences building gen 
AI applications with our clients throughout 2023, 
as well as decades delivering digital and analytics 
transformations (covered thoroughly in our book, 
Rewired).

Be intentional. Set gen AI strategy top-down.
Gen AI is a gold rush. Everyone from shareholders to 
employees to boards are scrambling to deploy the 
latest and most powerful gen AI tooling, and many 
large organizations have 150-plus gen AI use cases 
on backlog. While we share their excitement (and 
admire their ambition!), we have found that allowing 
dozens of gen AI projects to spawn across an 
organization puts at-scale value creation at risk.

With the recent developments in the gen AI 
space, the Cambrian explosion of the use cases 
and opportunities will only continue to split the 
already divided attention of leadership teams. 
C-suites must bring focus with a top-down gen AI 
strategy, while constantly returning to the question 
of how the technology can help create enduring 
strategic distance between the organization and 
its competitors. Here are some examples from first 
movers:

 —  Retail banks are increasing customer retention 
and offering conversion by deploying customer-
facing chatbots and hyperpersonalization.

 — Service operations are tackling ongoing labor 
shortages by building workflow copilots to 
improve productivity of existing labor forces to 
resolve customer requests on time.

marketplaces of GPTs will be created. There, 
users will be able to discover new applications 
and publish their own.

 — IT services players are growing market share by 
investing in software engineering productivity 
tools and pricing contracts more competitively.

6.  Gen AI costs continue to decline. For one, 
GPT-4 API costs declined two to three times 
for the average enterprise customer.

Smart organizations are taking a 2x2 approach: 
identify two fast use cases to register quick wins on 
the scoreboard and excite the organization, while

working on two slower, more transformational 
use cases that will change day-to-day business 
operations.

Reimagine entire domains rather than isolated 
use cases.
During 2023, most organizations began 
experimenting with gen AI, building one-off 
prototypes and buying off-the-shelf solutions. 
Yet as these solutions are rolled out to end users, 
organizations are struggling to capture value. For 
example, some organizations that have invested 
in Github Copilot have yet to figure out how the 
value capture is passed back to the business. 
Organizations need to reframe from one isolated use 
case to the full software delivery life cycle. Scrum 
teams need to commit to shipping more product 
features. Or sales needs to offer more competitive 
pricing to their customers and win more business. If 
companies stop at just buying a new shiny tool, the 
productivity gains will not translate to bottom-line 
gains.

That often means reimagining entire workflows and 
domains. This serves two purposes: 1) it creates a 
more seamless end-user experience by avoiding 
point solutions; and 2) organizations can more 
easily track value against clear business outcomes. 
For example, an insurer we have worked with is 
reimagining its end-to-end claims process—from 
first notice of loss to payment. For each step along 
the way, the insurer has identified gen AI, digital, and 
analytics opportunities, while never losing sight of 
the claims adjustor’s experience. Ultimately, this full 
sizing across the value chain made a step-change 
impact on end-to-end handling time.

Buy selectively. Build strategically.
Matching the pace of innovation, many new start-
ups and software offerings are entering the market, 
leaving enterprises with a familiar question: “Buy 
or build?” On the “buy” side, we see organizations 
that are wary about investing in capabilities that 
likely will eventually be available for a fraction of the 
cost. These same organizations are also skeptical 
of off-the-shelf solutions, unsure if the software will 
perform at scale without significant customization. 
As these solutions mature and prove their value, buy 

strategies will continue to play a central role in any 
gen AI strategy.

Meanwhile, some organizations are finding 
compelling business cases to “build,” as well. These 
players start by identifying use cases that create 
strategic competitive advantages against their peers, 
by compounding existing strengths in their domain 
expertise, workflow integration, or regulatory know-
how. For example, deploying gen AI to accelerate 
drug discovery has become standard in the 
pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, organizations 
are making investments in data and IT infrastructure 
to enable their portfolio of gen AI use cases. For many 
organizations, there has been little to no investment 
in unstructured data governance. Now is the time.

Build products, not POCs.
With the new tooling available, a talented engineer 
can build a proof of concept over a weekend. In some 
cases, this might be sufficient to serve an enterprise 
need (for example, a summarization chatbot). 
However, for most use cases in a large enterprise 
context, proofs of concepts are not sufficient. They do 
not scale well into production and their performance 
rapidly degrades without the appropriate engineering 
and experimentation. At OpenAI’s Dev Day, engineers 
showed how hard it is to turn a POC into a production-
grade product. At the start, a demo POC only 
achieved 45 percent accuracy for a retrieval task. 
After a few months and a dozen or so experiments (for 
example, fine-tuning, reranking, metadata tagging, 
data labeling, model self-assessment, risk guardrails), 
the engineers achieved 98 percent accuracy.

This leads to two implications. First, organizations 
cannot seek near-perfection on every use case. They 
need to be selective about when it is worthwhile to 
invest scarce engineering talent to develop high-
performance gen AI applications. For some situations, 
45 percent accuracy may be sufficient to deliver 
business benefit. Second, organizations need to scale 
their gen AI capabilities to meet their ambitions. Most 
organizations have identified hundreds of gen AI use 
cases. And so, organizations are turning to reusable 
code components to accelerate development. 
Dedicated engineers, often sitting in a center of 
excellence (COE), codify best practices into these 

Six major gen AI trends that will shape 2024’s agenda

122

code components, which allows subsequent gen 
AI efforts to build off the lessons learned from the 
trailblazing ones. We have seen these components 
accelerate delivery by 25 to 50 percent.

Throughout the past year, there has been an 
endless stream of gen AI news and hype. The 
coming year will likely be similar—but with a 
growing focus on delivering real business value 
to justify the billions in investment. From large 
enterprises to pioneering start-ups, organizations 

need to form their strategies around the 
decades-old principles from digital and analytics 
transformations. Organizations that get these 
tried-and-tested learnings right will form lasting 
strategic advantages against their competitors, 
creating sticky customer experiences 
and gaining market share in a challenging 
macroeconomic environment.

If 2023 was a year of hype, then 2024 will be the 
year of lasting impact at scale.

Glossary

Application programming interface (API) is a way to programmatically access (usually 
external) models, datasets, or other pieces of software.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of software to perform tasks that traditionally require 
human intelligence.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are composed of interconnected layers of software-based 
calculators known as “neurons.” These networks can absorb vast amounts of input data and 
process that data through multiple layers that extract and learn the data’s features.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks, which are 
layers of connected “neurons” whose connections have parameters or weights that can be 
trained. It is especially effective at learning from unstructured data such as images, text, and 
audio.

Early and late scenarios are the extreme scenarios of our work-automation model. The 
“earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting 
in faster automation development and adoption; the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters in 
the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.

Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pretrained foundation model to perform better in 
a specific task. This entails a relatively short period of training on a labeled dataset, which 
is much smaller than the dataset the model was initially trained on. This additional training 
allows the model to learn and adapt to the nuances, terminology, and specific patterns found 
in the smaller dataset.

Foundation models (FMs) are deep learning models trained on vast quantities of 
unstructured, unlabeled data that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the box or 
adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning. Examples of these models are GPT-4, PaLM, 
DALL·E 2, and Stable Diffusion.

Generative AI is AI that is typically built using foundation models and has capabilities that 
earlier AI did not have, such as the ability to generate content. Foundation models can also 
be used for nongenerative purposes (for example, classifying user sentiment as negative or 
positive based on call transcripts) while offering significant improvement over earlier models. 
For simplicity, when we refer to generative AI, we include all foundation model use cases.

Graphics processing units (GPUs) are computer chips that were originally developed for 
producing computer graphics (such as for video games) and are also useful for deep learning 
applications. In contrast, traditional machine learning and other analyses usually run on 
central processing units (CPUs), normally referred to as a computer’s “processor.”

Large language models (LLMs) make up a class of foundation models that can process 
massive amounts of unstructured text and learn the relationships between words or portions 
of words, known as tokens. This enables LLMs to generate natural-language text, performing 

127

Glossary

127

tasks such as summarization or knowledge extraction. GPT-4 (which underlies ChatGPT) and 
LaMDA (the model behind Bard) are examples of LLMs.

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI in which a model gains capabilities after it is trained 
on, or shown, many example data points. Machine learning algorithms detect patterns and 
learn how to make predictions and recommendations by processing data and experiences, 
rather than by receiving explicit programming instruction. The algorithms also adapt and can 
become more effective in response to new data and experiences.

Modality is a high-level data category such as numbers, text, images, video, and audio.

Productivity from labor is the ratio of GDP to total hours worked in the economy. Labor 
productivity growth comes from increases in the amount of capital available to each worker, 
the education and experience of the workforce, and improvements in technology.

Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing, refining, and optimizing input 
prompts to guide a generative AI model toward producing desired (that is, accurate) outputs.

Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention, is a mechanism that aims to mimic cognitive 
attention, relating different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the 
sequence.

Structured data is tabular data (for example, organized in tables, databases, or 
spreadsheets) that can be used to train some machine learning models effectively.

Transformers are a relatively new neural network architecture that relies on self-attention 
mechanisms to transform a sequence of inputs into a sequence of outputs while focusing its 
attention on important parts of the context around the inputs. Transformers do not rely on 
convolutions or recurrent neural networks.

Technical automation potential refers to the share of the work time that could be 
automated. We assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy 
through an analysis of the component activities of each occupation. We used databases 
published by institutions including the World Bank and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to 
break down about 850 occupations into approximately 2,100 activities, and we determined 
the performance capabilities needed for each activity based on how humans currently 
perform them.

Use cases are applications targeted to a specific business challenge that produce one or 
more measurable outcomes. For example, in marketing, generative AI could be used to 
generate creative content such as personalized emails.

Unstructured data lacks a consistent format or structure (for example, text, images, and 
audio files) and typically requires more advanced techniques to extract insights.
