McKinsey Global Institute

The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact base to 
aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s companies 
and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, and functional 
knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are solely the responsibility 
of MGI directors and partners.

Our research is currently grouped into five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity: Creating and harnessing the world’s assets most productively

 — Resources of the world: Building, powering, and feeding the world sustainably

 — Human potential: Maximizing and achieving the potential of human talent

 — Global connections: Exploring how flows of goods, services, people, capital, and ideas  

shape economies

 — Technologies and markets of the future: Discussing the next big arenas of value  

and competition

We aim for independent and fact-based research. None of our work is commissioned or funded 
by any business, government, or other institution; we share our results publicly free of charge; 
and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While we engage multiple distinguished 
external advisers to contribute to our work, the analyses presented in our publications are MGI’s 
alone, and any errors are our own.

At a glance

 — The past quarter century has been a success story for global productivity. Median 

economy productivity has jumped sixfold. Thirty emerging economies, with 3.6 billion people, 
are in the “fast lane” of improvement; if they maintained this pace, they would converge to 
advanced-economy productivity levels within roughly the next quarter century.

 — Yet amid this global revolution, many economies have experienced productivity 

stagnation. Advanced-economy productivity growth has slowed by about one percentage 
point since the global financial crisis (GFC). At their current pace of improvement, “slow-
lane” emerging economies, home to 1.4 billion people, would never catch up to advanced-
economy levels. 

 — Today the world needs productivity growth more than ever. It is the only way to raise 
living standards amid aging, the energy transition, supply chain reconfiguration, and 
inflated global balance sheets.

 — By investing to regain pre-GFC productivity growth, advanced economies stand 
to gain between $1,500 and $8,000 in incremental GDP per capita by 2030. 
These economies experienced their slowdowns as two waves of productivity growth 
in manufacturing (powered by Moore’s law and offshoring) came to an end. Post-GFC 
investment declined sharply and persistently, failing to generate anything to take their 
place. But today, directed investment in areas such as digitization, automation, and artificial 
intelligence could fuel new waves of productivity growth. 

 — Investment is also the primary driver for emerging economies to reach or remain in 
the “fast lane.” Current fast-lane economies (China, India, parts of Central and Eastern 
Europe, and Emerging Asia) have sustained high investment, at 20 to 40 percent of GDP. 
They have channeled it into building the cities and infrastructure that underpin successful 
urbanization, higher productivity in service sectors, and globally connected manufacturing. 
Economies in the middle and slow lanes might follow suit.

 — There is reason for hope and motivation for action. Higher inflation and interest rates may 
signal stronger demand and encourage productive capital allocation—while discouraging the 
increasing debt and inflating asset prices of the past two decades. AI has potential to change 
work rapidly and broadly, creating fertile conditions for such investment.

Investing in productivity growthThe world needs to—and can—
accelerate productivity growth

The world’s living standards have climbed sharply over the past 25 years, driven by strong 
productivity growth.1 Median economy productivity surged sixfold over this period.2

Yet productivity growth is fading, and in many parts of the world, it has failed to start at all.  
Since the global financial crisis (GFC) around 2008, there has been a near-universal slowdown. 
In advanced economies, productivity growth had already decelerated before the GFC—from an 
average of 2.2 percent per year in the five years to 2002 to 1.6 percent through 2007—and then 
fell further, to less than 1 percent, in the 2012–22 decade.3 In emerging economies, productivity 
growth accelerated before the GFC, from 2.0 percent in the five years to 2002 to 5.9 percent 
through 2007, and then fell to 3.4 percent in the decade to 2022.4

Productivity growth means getting more from our work and from our investments (see sidebar 
“Measuring productivity”). It is especially needed now as the world faces the many challenges 
of a new geo-economic era. Productivity growth is the best antidote to the asset price inflation 
of the past two decades, which has created about $160 trillion in “paper wealth” and even larger 
amounts of new debt. Absent a surge in productivity, we could be headed for a Japan-style 
wealth reset or a period of sustained inflation.5 Second, we need to fund the net-zero transition 
and keep improving living standards if we are to achieve sustainable inclusive growth. Closing 
the empowerment gap and the net-zero investment gap requires the equivalent of 8 percent 
of global GDP annually, which will be very hard to achieve without rapid productivity growth.6 
Other looming challenges include aging populations in most advanced economies, China, and 
elsewhere, along with global trade tensions and supply chain disruptions. 

This report provides an overview for private and public decision makers on the most important 
features of productivity growth, why it slowed, and what reaccelerating it would take.7 It offers 
a fresh look at the slowdown in advanced economies and quantifies the few drivers that matter 
most. It analyzes emerging economies that are traveling in different “lanes” at varying speeds  
and distills what lagging economies would need to do to shift into the fast lane of growth. 

It argues for one common imperative across all economies: investment in tangible and 
intangible capital.

2  Based on Conference Board data (from the Total Economy Database) for 125 emerging and advanced economies. The sixfold 
increase is the jump in the weighted median productivity level of these economies between 1997 and 2022. Note that several 
numbers in this report may not perfectly match similar numbers from other MGI reports. The differences normally come from 
different definitions or methodologies, depending on the data source. For example, in the February 2023 MGI report Rekindling 
US productivity for a new era, the most common measure is nonfarm, private business labor productivity, while in this report we 
use total economy productivity. Additionally, that report uses data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, while here we use 
The Conference Board and other sources that allow us to make comparisons across economies. Like the United States, other 
economies have local sources whose statistics may differ slightly from the numbers we present.

3  We split the quarter century into five-year periods: 1997–2002, 2002–07, 2012–16, and 2016–22. We skip the volatile five 
years of the GFC (2007–12) because they are highly distortive. For instance, in the United States, growth in capital per hour 
jumped significantly during the crisis simply because hours worked tanked.

4  China and India are among the economies whose productivity growth slowed, but their increasing importance masks a starker 

decline. Excluding them, productivity growth in emerging economies fell from 3.5 percent in 2002–07 to 1.3 percent in 2012–22.

Investing in productivity growthMeasuring productivity

Productivity is a measure of output 
relative to input. For this report, we focus 
on labor productivity, which is defined 
as economic output (gross domestic 
product, or GDP) per hour worked.1 This 
is a commonly used productivity measure 
and the most consequential determinant of 
long-run economic and real wage growth. 
Rising prosperity—a higher standard of 
living—can come only from productivity 
growth in the long run. And over time, labor 

productivity and real wages are closely, 
though not perfectly, linked.2

Two input factors drive labor productivity. 
The first is the amount of capital per worker, 
the increase of which is also called capital 
deepening. Capital can be tangible, like 
machines or infrastructure, or intangible, 
like software or R&D investment. Office 
workers are more productive with a 
laptop than without one, construction 
workers more productive with a crane, 
and transportation service workers more 

productive with good infrastructure in 
place, all else being equal. The second 
factor is human capital: the education, 
abilities, and accumulated experience of 
working people. 

Finally, productivity can rise from using 
physical and human capital more efficiently. 
This total factor productivity (TFP) is 
commonly measured as a residual after 
accounting for capital deepening and 
human capital growth. 

1  We focus on national- or sector-level productivity from a growth economics perspective. Organizational or individual worker-level productivity research often studies  

other issues related to attrition, disengagement, skills mismatch, or time inefficiency. See, for example, Aaron De Smet, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, Angelika Reich, and  
Bill Schaninger, “Some employees are destroying value. Others are building it. Do you know the difference?,” McKinsey Quarterly, September 2023. We take GDP as 
reported by internationally recognized institutions and research organizations. We are aware that GDP is an imperfect metric; see, for example, “A study of lights at night 
suggests dictators lie about economic growth,” Economist, September 29, 2022. But using official statistics is the most reliable and consistent way, at least for now, to 
establish economy comparisons. We divide GDP by hours worked whenever possible, and by number of employees when hours worked data is not available. GDP per hour 
worked is more precise. Variation in hours per employee by economy stems from labor market regulation differences, differences in preference for part-time employment, 
and other factors.

2017; and Grant E. Hayes et al., Productivity and wages: What was the productivity-wage link in the digital revolution of the past, and what might occur in the AI revolution of 
the future?, National Bureau of Economic Research, working paper number 30734, December 2022.

This report consists of four sections. Section 1 reviews worldwide productivity performance over 
the past 25 years and identifies which emerging economies are in the fast, middle, and slow 
lanes on the highway of convergence with advanced-economy standards of living.8 Section 2 
offers in-depth analysis of the recent productivity growth slowdown in advanced economies. 
Section 3 delves into emerging economies and what it takes to be in the fast lane. Finally, section 
4 discusses productivity growth in this new geo-economic era, laying out the main challenges 
and opportunities for businesses and policy makers.

8  Throughout this report, we use the word “convergence.” We define it as the process of emerging economies catching up with 

advanced economies by growing their productivity at a faster speed. An emerging economy that has higher productivity growth 
than advanced economies is converging, while one that has equal or lower productivity growth is not converging or is diverging.

1. The rise and fall of 
global productivity growth 
in the 21st century

Over the past 25 years, the world experienced strong productivity growth, driven in large part 
by China and India. This trend enabled many emerging regions and economies to narrow the 
gap—or “converge”—with the living standards of more advanced economies. However, the 
global financial crisis (GFC) worsened an existing slowdown in productivity growth in advanced 
economies and applied the brakes to a pre-crisis surge in emerging economies. 

The world has had strong productivity growth over 
the past 25 years, driven by standout regions

From 1997 to 2022, median economy productivity jumped roughly sixfold, going from 
approximately $7,000 to $41,000 per employee, which is equivalent to an annual growth rate 
of 7.3 percent.9 The average global productivity growth rate was 2.3 percent annually during 
this period. (For an even longer-term perspective, see sidebar “The very long run: 100 years of 
convergence and divergence.”) 

Gains were most prominent in the middle and at the bottom of the global productivity distribution, 
as several major population centers experienced a surge of catch-up growth (Exhibit 1). The 
bottom 10 percent of economies made large gains, quadrupling their productivity, while progress 
was slower for the top 10 percent, which edged forward by 20 percent over this period.10

The average global productivity 
growth rate was 2.3 percent 
annually from 1997 to 2022.

9  Calculated as the median of the productivity level of all economies in each respective year. A sixfold increase is equivalent to 

an annual growth rate greater than 7 percent. Note the difference from the average, which grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent 
per hour (or 2.1 percent per employee). These are all population-weighted figures, so China and India have a significant weight, 
particularly on the median.

10 Our findings are in line with those of Patel, Sandefur, and Subramanian, who find global unconditional convergence of GDP 

per capita starting in the mid-1990s. See Dev Patel, Arvind Subramanian, and Justin Sandefur, “The new era of unconditional 
convergence,” Journal of Development Economics, Volume 152, September 2021.

China and India accounted for nearly half of aggregate global productivity growth (Exhibit 2). 
Other regions—Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Emerging Asia—also made rapid 
progress, narrowing their gap with advanced economies. Yet growth rates in the Middle East 
and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean were similar to or 
lower than those in advanced economies, which means that they did not converge at all or even 
fell behind.

Emerging economies are on a three-lane highway to catch up with  
advanced economies

Ideally, all economies would have high productivity growth and raise their living standards. 
Additionally, economies with lower productivity levels would catch up—that is, converge—with 
higher-productivity economies as they replicate the best ideas in humanity and generate higher 
initial returns on fresh capital. 

Yet the pace at which emerging economies have been raising productivity varies widely 
(Exhibit 3). If they kept the average pace of productivity growth of the past quarter century, 
Poland would fully close the gap with the average advanced economy in 11 years and China would 
get there in 16 years. But Indonesia would take 135 years, and Argentina would never get there.11

We classify economies into the fast, middle, and slow lanes of convergence. These lanes are 
defined by both the economies’ starting points (their productivity level in 1997 on the x-axis), and 

11  This calculation assumes that every economy keeps growing at past rates permanently. This is an illustrative exercise; naturally, 
we expect economies to slow down as they get richer. For a discussion of China’s catch-up trajectory with the United States 
that models falling growth rates over time, see Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Lee E. Ohanian, and Wen Yao, The neoclassical 
growth of China, National Bureau of Economic Research, working paper number 31351, June 2023.

their speed (their rate of productivity growth on the y-axis).12 In short, an economy in the fast lane 
has experienced high productivity growth relative to its starting productivity level. Our data set 
includes 27 advanced economies and 91 emerging economies.

 — Advanced economies are at the forefront. These 27 economies in Western Europe, North 
America, and Advanced Asia represent about one billion people. As a group, they have 
averaged 1.0 percent productivity growth over the past 25 years. This is a relatively slow-
moving target for economies striving to catch up, but advanced economies are still moving 
forward and capturing the power of compounding improvements.

 — China, India, most of Central and Eastern Europe, and some other individual economies are 
in the fast lane. Thirty emerging economies, representing 3.6 billion people, are in the top 
third of performance. On average, their productivity growth was about 6 percent per year. 
This enabled more than one billion people to escape poverty over the past 25 years in China 
and India alone.13 At their 6 percent rate, an average fast-lane economy with a productivity 
level of $34,000 would take 28 years to match the advanced-economy average.14 In Europe, 
fast-lane economies include Romania, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. Beyond China 

12 We run a linear regression where starting productivity level is the independent variable and productivity growth the dependent 

variable. Outperformers are above the line, underperformers below it. Crossing this regression line with the advanced 
economies’ growth rate, we set a focal point and shift the slope of the regression line to divide emerging economies into equal 
thirds: top third (fast lane), middle third (middle lane), and bottom third (slow lane).

13 Defined as poverty head-count ratio at $3.65 a day (2017, purchasing-power parity). Poverty and inequality platform, World Bank.
14 We take the 2022 productivity level of any emerging economy or group of emerging economies and the advanced-economy 
average, and apply forward their respective annual productivity growth rates between 1997 and 2022. The time to converge 
represents how long it would take for these two productivity levels to coincide at these growth rates.

The very long run: 100 years of convergence and divergence

For as long as they have been measured, 
waves of productivity growth have flowed 
across regions, industries, and eras, 
generated by new technologies and by 
the ways cities and infrastructure were 
adapted to them (Exhibit). 

Those technologies may be wholly 
new to the world, driving growth in the 
living standards of frontier or advanced 
economies. Or they may be newly adopted 
by emerging economies, delivering what 
is often termed “catch-up” growth, which 
allows their living standards to converge 
with those of more advanced economies.

At the beginning of the 20th century, in 
the lead-up to and through World War I, 
innovations made the United States the 
frontier economy, taking the mantle of 
innovation and productivity leadership 

from Europe (and the United Kingdom in 
particular). Driven by the Second Industrial 
Revolution, which brought electrification, 
mass production, and automation, US 
productivity growth averaged almost 
3 percent from 1910 through the 1970s, 
despite the Great Depression and slumps at 
the end of each world war. This performance 
was driven by increased productivity in 
manufacturing and the mechanization of 
agriculture, as well as deep changes in 
sector composition as agriculture fell from 
41 percent of the total US workforce in 1900 
to just 4 percent in 1970.1

After World War II, Europe and Japan enjoyed 
strong productivity booms. Populations 
moved to urban centers as investment rebuilt 
the cities to accommodate the new residents. 
Investment in technology supported catch-
up with the United States. Only the 1970s 

energy crises and stagflation brought the 
boom to an end.

China then accelerated its productivity 
growth after opening its economy in 1978. 
Its convergence with advanced economies 
started thanks to pro-market reforms and 
sustained high investment. China joined 
the World Trade Organization in 2001 and 
became deeply integrated into global 
supply chains before its productivity growth 
peaked in the late 2000s. Other major 
Asian economies, such as India, also made 
progress as they integrated into global value 
chains over the past quarter century. The 
remaining emerging economies, on average, 
also had a boost in productivity growth in 
the early 2000s, but overall, their growth 
was weak (along the lines of advanced 
economies’ growth).

and India, Asian fast-lane economies include Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Cambodia.15 The fast 
lane also includes a few top performers from Sub-Saharan Africa, like Ethiopia and Rwanda.

 — The middle lane has economies from every region, slowly converging with advanced 

economies. In 30 economies, with 1.3 billion people, productivity growth has been broadly 
in line with expectations given their starting points. Between 1997 and 2022, they averaged 
2.1 percent productivity growth—twice the rate of advanced economies. At this rate, an 
economy with an average middle-lane productivity of $36,000 per worker in 2022 would

 — Economies in the slow lane, largely from Latin America and the Caribbean, Sub-

Saharan Africa, and the Middle East and North Africa, have not converged at all. These 
31 economies have 1.4 billion people, almost one-third of whom live in poverty.16 Their 
productivity has grown at an average rate of 0.3 percent. Several of them not only failed to 
narrow the gap with advanced economies over the past 25 years but actually fell further 
behind. At this pace, they would never converge with advanced economies.

particularly during the integration period with Western Europe. Central Europe doubled output 
per worker to more than $80,000. Meanwhile, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa stayed 
well below the productivity frontier throughout the period.

Across all regions, the standout driver has been increasing capital per hour; in most places, 
it accounted for 70 to 80 percent of overall productivity growth.18 China and India led the 
way, with growth in capital per hour contributing 6.5 and 3.9 percent to productivity growth, 
respectively (Exhibit 5). They started in 1997 with capital stock of just $10,000 to $11,000 per

18 We use a Solow decomposition, breaking productivity growth down into capital per worker, labor quality, and total factor 
productivity (TFP) (see sidebar “Measuring productivity”). This classic decomposition has some shortcomings. Notably, 
measuring the contribution from capital via the factor share in output assumes constant returns to scale and substitutability 
of labor and capital—two assumptions that are increasingly questionable in an intangible world. There are also significant 
measurement differences in capital services depending on whether and how to include quality improvements in capital, for 
instance, from better and cheaper machines and electronics. In this decomposition, we use The Conference Board’s data set, 
which strongly weights these improvements via so-called hedonic deflators. As a result, a large portion of capital-embodied 
technical change will be shown as capital per worker instead of TFP, in line with the notion that all sectors and economies that 
are not producing these technologies can simply buy them as capital. Other data sets use smaller deflators of capital, so quality 
improvements show up as TFP growth instead of growth in capital per worker, resulting a larger relative contribution of TFP. 
Generally, capital still dominates in these cases, just less overwhelmingly.

heavily in urbanization, infrastructure, businesses, and manufacturing facilities. They multiplied 
their capital stock per worker by factors of eight and four, respectively, and contributed about 
45 percent of global capital formation. Central Europe and Emerging Asia were the closest 
followers, roughly doubling their capital stocks.

Switching lanes is possible
Although the successes of China and India over the past quarter century may seem miraculous, 
they are not unique. China and India were once slow growers, and they have recently been 
following the paths previously taken by economies such as Japan and South Korea (Exhibit 6).

Similarly, an economy in the middle or slow lane can take steps to enter the slipstreams of faster 
productivity growth, lifting standards of living in the process. From 2014 to 2019, for example, 
the Philippines grew its productivity at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, Thailand at 3.7 percent, 
and Malaysia at 3.0 percent. In Africa, Tanzania (4.7 percent), Cameroon (4.2 percent), and Kenya 
(4.0 percent) each achieved fast-lane rates over the same period.

Investing in productivity growthProductivity growth and the pace of convergence 
have slowed since the GFC

In recent years, progress in emerging economies has slowed across all three lanes (Exhibit 7). 
This means the pace of convergence with advanced economies has been decelerating, as shown 
in Exhibit 4 by the almost universal inverted U-shape in each region’s trajectory. The growth rates 
of emerging economies have been falling toward those of advanced economies, despite their 
significantly lower productivity levels. The pandemic accelerated this negative trend from 2020 
to 2022, though productivity numbers during crises should be interpreted with care.20

Productivity growth in advanced economies had already slowed before the GFC, falling from an 
average of 2.2 percent per year between 1997 and 2002 to 1.6 percent between 2002 and 2007. 
Since then, it has declined to less than 1 percent. Across North America, Western Europe, and 
Advanced Asia, the persistence of the slowdown, more than a decade after the GFC, is striking. 
The United States was one of the few advanced economies that managed to rebound slightly in 
the final years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet even there, productivity growth rates for 
2018 and 2019 (0.9 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively) would not be enough to conclude that 
the economy was on a new acceleration path.

For emerging economies, all three lanes experienced an acceleration in the run-up to the GFC, but 
the surge did not last. Almost all fast-lane economies suffered sharp declines after the GFC, though 
the lane as a whole stayed above its 1997–2002 pace thanks to China and India’s large and growing 
weight.21 The slow lane (largely populated by economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and 
the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa, with some notable exceptions) experienced 
sluggish growth of 2.1 percent before the GFC, then turned negative for the entire 2012–22 period.

If capital per worker explained most of high productivity growth for 25 years, did it also drive the 
slowdown? In advanced and fast-lane economies, slower growth in capital per worker after the 
GFC does indeed explain a lot. By contrast, middle-lane economies had higher capital deepening 
after the GFC than they did before it (in part because the Asian financial crisis of 1997 choked 
off investment). In the slow lane, growth in capital per worker was low all along, explaining 
persistently slow productivity growth. Beyond capital, other factors that had accelerated before 
the GFC weakened after it. These include slower growth in international trade and the integration 
of global supply chains, which hindered advances in the economic complexity of exports, slower 
progress of institutional reforms, and less favorable demographic trends.22

In recent years, the growth 
rates of emerging economies 
have been falling toward those 
of advanced economies.

20 Productivity behavior during economic crises is often volatile and not necessarily reflective of longer-term trends, and 

measurement issues can arise during turbulent times. We remain vigilant, because the pandemic could indeed leave scars on 
long-term productivity growth, but for now we put less weight on the past four years.

21 One way to eliminate the effect of China’s and India’s size is to take simple instead of weighted averages, so that each 

economy’s weight is the same. If we do that, fast-lane productivity growth in the four periods was 4.4, 6.1, 1.9, and 2.2 percent, 
respectively, indicating a much sharper slowdown.

2. Advanced economies: The 
breaking waves of productivity

In this section, we unpack the causes of declining productivity growth in advanced economies. 
We look in particular at various factors and sectors for the United States, Japan, and the five 
largest economies of Western Europe, which together represent 78 percent of GDP in all 
advanced economies.23

While many drivers affect productivity growth, two stand out for explaining the performance of 
advanced economies in recent years. First, manufacturing experienced waves of productivity 
advances fueled by the effects of Moore’s law and a burst of offshoring and restructuring. 
(Moore’s law, which holds that the number of transistors in a microchip doubles every two years, 
signals more broadly that computers become more powerful and efficient while coming down 
in cost.) These waves yielded productivity gains before the GFC but petered out over time. The 
second major factor is a secular decline in investment across multiple sectors (Exhibit 8). These 
two trends explain the slump in advanced economies almost entirely.24 Digitization was much 
discussed as the main candidate to rev up productivity again, but its impact failed to spread 
beyond the information and communications technology (ICT) sector.

The implications of the slowdown are significant. If the United States had not had a 
manufacturing slowdown, its GDP per capita in 2022 would have been around $5,000 higher. 
If growth in capital per worker had not declined, it would have been around $4,500 higher.25 
Overall, if the United States had continued growing its productivity at pre-GFC rates, its GDP per 
capita would have been $8,900 higher in 2022. In Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, 
per capita income could have been $3,500 to $5,900 higher; in Japan, it could have been about 
$1,700 higher. Yet economies could reverse these trends in the years ahead. If they invest to 
regain pre-GFC productivity growth, advanced economies stand to gain between $1,500 (Japan) 
and $8,000 (United States) in incremental GDP per capita by 2030.

23 The European economies are France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, which together represent 74 percent of 
continental GDP. Our data set for this analysis is EU KLEMS, which allows us to go deeper into specific sectors but covers only 
some advanced economies. We also end the post-GFC period in 2019 because the data stops in 2020, but figures for 2020 are 
highly distorted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A minor discrepancy is that capital per worker tends to appear larger in data from 
The Conference Board than in EU KLEMS, which uses hedonic deflators for ICT capital stocks.

24 Beyond manufacturing and investment, across economies, other, smaller factors either helped or hindered, but these two 

were dominant. Together, they account for about 90 percent of the slowdown in the United States, 100 percent in Germany, 
110 percent in the United Kingdom, and 140 percent in Japan. A number larger than 100, as in Japan and the United Kingdom, 
means that other drivers boosted productivity growth and partially made up for the manufacturing and investment effects. The 
trajectories in Spain and Italy were different than in the other advanced economies because they did not have an aggregate 
productivity growth slowdown—their growth was sluggish all along. And yet manufacturing and investment slowed productivity 
growth substantially, too. The reason aggregate productivity growth remained stable in these two economies is that other 
drivers compensated for the negative contribution of manufacturing and investment. France was the only economy where the 
combination of manufacturing and investment, while still relevant, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the slowdown, did not 
explain it entirely.

25 Note that these two figures cannot be simply added together. There is some overlap between them, owing to capital per worker 

in manufacturing, as well as a small drag not accounted for by either of these two drivers.

Investing in productivity growth 
Two waves of productivity growth in manufacturing have ended

Two cresting waves explain much of the rapid productivity growth in manufacturing until 
the mid-2000s as well as the subsequent slowdown. First, Moore’s law (the doubling of the 
number of transistors in a microchip every two years) translated into price declines and rapid 
consumer gains. But this effect waned over time, slowing total factor productivity (TFP) 
growth in electronics manufacturing (Exhibit 8, 1A).26 Second, before the GFC, the automation, 
restructuring, and offshoring of labor-intensive production boosted capital per worker in 
manufacturing, while advanced economies retained primarily capital-intensive (and knowledge-
intensive) activities. But that effect petered out, too (Exhibit 8, 1C). There was also a slowdown in 
TFP growth in manufacturing subsectors other than electronics, with multiple causes depending 
on the subsector, though none standing out (Exhibit 8, 1B).27

These waves caused strong pre-GFC growth in both electronics and other manufacturing, which 
significantly contributed to aggregate productivity growth (Exhibit 9, US example).28 As their 
contribution waned after the GFC, so too did productivity growth in the overall economy (see 
sidebar “A detailed economy-sector view of the productivity slowdown and the mix effect” for a 
comprehensive economy-by-economy and sector-by-sector analysis).

Moore’s law translated into price 
declines and rapid consumer gains, 
but the effect waned over time.

26 See sidebar “Measuring productivity” for an explanation of the decomposition of productivity growth into input factors: capital 

per worker or per hour, labor quality, and TFP.

27 Only the coke and refined petroleum products subsector was consistently positive across economies; the rest were 

overwhelmingly negative. Sector contributions to the slowdown were generally very small and spread out, with no sector 
beyond electronics dominating. The next major contributors across economies beyond electronics, even if not dominant, were 
machinery and equipment, automotive, and pharmaceutical products.

28 In the exhibit, the big spike of 2019 is caused by the fact that these are three-year rolling averages. The figure for 2019 is an 
average of 2018, 2019, and 2020, and 2020 had unusually high productivity growth (5.9 percent) because of the COVID-19 
pandemic. In 2019 alone, productivity growth in the United States was 1.6 percent.

The declining value of Moore’s law
While most manufacturing subsectors suffered a productivity slowdown, electronics was the 
main culprit. The main reason was slowing growth in consumer value derived from the effects 
of Moore’s law (Exhibit 8, 1A). While nominal value added growth was relatively stable, product 
performance per unit of price surged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and subsequently 
fell. Hence, despite the ongoing progress of Moore’s law, the translation into real value added

in real value added, which gets adjusted for changes in prices and improvements in quality. The value-added deflator is an index that captures these changes 
and is applied to nominal value added to transform it into real value added.

slowed.29 Technically, this shows up as lower growth in the value-added deflator (Exhibit 10, US 
example).30 This was true in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France 
(but particularly stark in the United States and Japan because they benefited from a larger 
positive pre-GFC wave).

In the United States, productivity growth in electronics manufacturing fell from 24.0 to 5.4 percent, 
explaining about 40 percent of the slowdown in all of manufacturing and 20 percent of the 
economy-wide decline. This was despite the fact that this sector represents about 1 to 2 percent 
of employment and value added; this small part of the economy had an outsize effect. The other 

29 Productivity is defined as real value added divided by hours worked. Real value added, in turn, is calculated as nominal value 

added, or total output, adjusted with a deflator. This deflator takes into account not only price inflation but also product quality. 
For example, even if a 2020 model small car has the same price as its 1997 equivalent, it has many more quality features, so 
its real value added will be much larger. For electronics manufacturing, we observe that nominal value added growth is stable, 
while real value added growth declines sharply. In other words, most of the decline in electronics manufacturing productivity 
growth is explained by the deflator, which accounts for price changes and product quality improvements.

30 There is debate on whether the effects of Moore’s law actually slowed or not in recent years, while it took increasing amounts 
of investment to honor it. For discussion, see Kenneth Flamm, “Measuring Moore’s Law: Evidence from price, cost, and quality 
indexes,” in Measuring and accounting for innovation in the twenty-first century, National Bureau of Economic Research, 
University of Chicago Press, 2021; Nicholas Bloom et al., “Are ideas getting harder to find?,” American Economic Review, 
volume 110, number 4, April 2020; and “Jensen Huang says Moore’s law is dead. Not quite yet,” Economist, December 13, 
2023. Price declines stemming from Moore’s law are not the only reason productivity growth in electronics accelerated in the 
late 1990s and early 2000s then decelerated. Feenstra et al., for example, argue that terms-of-trade gains and tariff changes 
affected the measurement of IT prices, overstating US productivity gains before the GFC. Robert C. Feenstra et al., “Effects 
of terms of trade gains and tariff changes on the measurement of US productivity growth,” American Economic Journal: 
Economic Policy, volume 5, number 1, February 2013.

Investing in productivity growthmanufacturing subsectors dropped from 3.7 to 0.6 percent. In our Western European sample, on 
average, growth in electronics productivity declined from 8.9 to 2.4 percent, explaining a fifth of the 
manufacturing slowdown (with the United Kingdom and Germany experiencing larger declines off a 
higher base); other subsectors declined from 3.0 to 1.3 percent. In Japan, electronics declined from 
12.6 to 3.7 percent; the other subsectors went from 1.8 to 1.4 percent.

The end of an offshoring and restructuring wave
Productivity growth in manufacturing also slowed after the GFC with the breaking of the 
offshoring and restructuring wave (Exhibit 8, 1C).31 In the late 1990s and early 2000s, labor-
intensive manufacturing jobs in many advanced economies were either moved to places where 
labor was cheaper (often to China but also to Mexico, Central Europe, or Eastern Europe) or 
automated.32

In the United States, these choices led to a decline in manufacturing hours worked of 
2.4 percent per year between 1997 and 2007 (Exhibit 11). Capital investment did not suffer an

31 As the exhibit shows, this affects both the manufacturing and investment slumps.
32 One of the commonly discussed drivers of the shrinking of manufacturing is “exporting productivity to China.” In most advanced 
economies, the value added of net exports to China has decreased markedly since the mid-1990s but remains below 1 percent 
of GDP. The sharpest decrease in net exports to China occurred from 1997 to 2007, driven mostly by manufacturing subsectors 
such as electronics and textiles, and remained relatively stable from 2012 to 2018. This drove an acceleration in manufacturing 
productivity growth from a wave of rationalization and offshoring, which ebbed in the late 2000s when global supply chains 
matured. (Based on analysis of the OECD’s TiVA data set.)

22

Investing in productivity growthequivalent decline, resulting in a boost in capital per worker and hence productivity growth, 
presumably because the parts of manufacturing that remained required ongoing investment 
to stay on the frontier. Once the offshoring and restructuring wave ended, the hours worked 
in manufacturing resumed growth, and growth in productivity and capital per worker slowed 
to more moderate levels. A similar pattern emerged in Europe and Japan. In Germany, a 
0.6 percent decline in hours worked reversed to 0.5 percent growth, and in the United 
Kingdom, a 3.7 percent decline became 0.3 percent growth. In France the decline continued 
but slowed, going from a 1.5 percent reduction to 0.4 percent, and in Japan from 2.0 percent to 
0.6 percent. Of these economies, only Germany saw equivalent growth in capital services.

A secular investment decline also weakened productivity growth

A marked and persistent decline in the growth of capital per worker explains the other half  
of the post-GFC productivity slowdown in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom,  
and Japan.33

The slump in capital investment slowed productivity growth beyond manufacturing by 
0.5 percentage point in the United States, 0.3 point in our Western European sample economies, 
and 0.2 point in Japan, accounting for about 30 to 50 percent of their overall slowdown 
(Exhibit 8, 2). This decline spanned almost all sectors: in the United States, the only exceptions 
were mining and agriculture; in Europe, only mining, construction, and finance and insurance 
generally remained stable, while real estate accelerated. 

More specifically, slowing growth in tangible capital (for example, machines, equipment, and 
buildings) explains almost 90 percent of the drop in the United States and 100 percent in Europe. 
From 1997 to 2019, gross fixed capital formation in tangibles fell from 22 to 14 percent of gross 
value added in the United States and from 25 to 17 percent in Europe. Intangible capital growth 
(for example, R&D and software) was more resilient but could not make up for falling investment 
in the material world. Gross fixed capital formation in intangibles increased from 12 to 16 percent 
in the United States and from 10 to 12 percent in Europe.34 Investment in intangibles is needed 
to boost corporate performance and labor productivity, but it may face barriers (skills needed 
to scale up, limited collateralization and recovery value), and the productivity benefits can take 
longer to materialize.35

To complete the investment picture, we looked beyond the growth of capital per worker to net 
fixed investment as a percentage of GDP (Exhibit 12). Two dips occurred in most economies. The 
first and smaller one coincided with the end of the dot-com boom: as the bubble burst in the 
early 2000s, investment slowed, particularly in the United States and Europe. The larger slump 
occurred when the GFC hit; to date, none of the advanced economies we analyzed has seen its 
investment rate recover to pre-crisis levels.

33 In Spain and Italy, capital per worker played a very similar role: it slowed productivity growth by 0.4 percentage point and 

0.5 percentage point, respectively. However, in these economies, total factor productivity moved in the opposite direction, 
causing the aggregate economy to remain stable. France was the only economy in our advanced economies sample where 
capital per worker did not play a relevant role; TFP explained its entire slowdown.

Sluggish demand and macroeconomic uncertainty are likely the main culprits behind  
the decline in investment 
Given the timing of the slumps, investment most likely fell as a result of each crisis. In their wake, 
the macroeconomic outlook was uncertain and demand was weak, resulting in lower productivity 
growth. Then, even when economic activity resumed and conditions improved, the temporary 
shock appeared to cause longer-term scars (or so-called hysteresis effects).36

Over the longer term, other macro trends such as a structural savings glut from aging, inequality, 
and capital inflows from emerging economies may have added to the problem, driving advanced 
economies into “secular stagnation” (a phenomenon marked by sluggish demand, persistent 
output gaps, low interest rates, and low investment).37

These longer-term effects and the timing of the slowdown suggest that sluggish demand played a 
strong role in slowing productivity growth, which contrasts with the typical supply-side-centered 
explanation. The virtuous cycle of growth can begin with (or be constrained by) any of its parts, 
including the demand side. Labor productivity growth drives higher incomes, which increase 
demand for products and services, which in turn encourages business investment and innovation, 
driving productivity growth and restarting the cycle. 

On the plus side, US shale oil and gas attracted a major investment boom, with yearly capital 
expenditure increasing by a factor of seven between 2007 and 2014. Investment into the sector 
later fluctuated, but in 2023 it was still about five times higher than in 2007. Consequently, the 

36 Hysteresis is an effect whereby an economic state persists even when the factors that led to it have changed. See, for example, 
Olivier J. Blanchard and Lawrence H. Summers, Hysteresis and the European unemployment problem, National Bureau of 
Economic Research, working paper number 1950, June 1986.

37  Lawrence H. Summers, “Demand side secular stagnation,” American Economic Review, volume 105, number 5, May 2015.

24

Investing in productivity growth 
United States added more output to oil and gas than any other economy in the world. However, 
this was not enough to offset the overall investment decline. 

Regulation may have contributed to lower investment
Changing dynamics in regulation and competition policy may also play a role in holding back 
investment. A surge of reform swept advanced economies from the early 1980s to about the 
time of the GFC, with nothing comparable in the past decade.38 Business surveys have singled 
out regulation as one of the central impediments to investment.39 Other regulatory aspects, 
such as credit tightening in the post-crisis years (at least partially due to more stringent banking 
regulation), may also have contributed to lower investment and productivity growth.40

However, regulation is a complex topic encompassing many aspects that can enhance or 
hinder investment. Even the issues cited above have had mixed or unclear effects. Some 
evidence suggests that the relationship between credit access and productivity growth may be 
U-shaped—that is, productivity growth is lower with both high and low levels of credit access, and 
higher at a sweet spot in the middle.41 And some studies find no relationship between increasing 
regulatory stringency and the lower business dynamism observed in the United States.42

The decline in investment was steep and sudden, occurred in both the early 2000s and 2008 
(coinciding with recessions), and affected most sectors—all of which suggests that regulatory 
changes were probably not the main reason behind it. But some regulatory choices, including 
the absence of a strong new surge of pro-competition reform in the past decade, may have 
contributed to the investment slowdown, or at least limited its recovery in some economies.

Digitization didn’t make a broad splash beyond the ICT sector

The periodic introduction of new technologies has fueled productivity growth over the past 
century. If Moore’s law effects and offshoring added momentum at the turn of the century, it may 
have been unrealistic to expect their energies to continue. A burst of digital innovation might 
have compensated, but so far it has had a muted impact on productivity beyond the ICT sector.

The tech sector at the heart of the digital transition has indeed delivered productivity growth—in 
fact, the fastest growth among all sectors in the United States both before and after the GFC 
(6.7 percent per year before the crisis and 5.0 percent afterward; see Exhibit 9). ICT similarly had 
the fastest productivity growth in Western Europe. Although it slowed from 5.1 percent in 1997–
2007 to 2.7 percent afterward, this was still about four times higher than overall productivity 
growth. In Japan, ICT productivity growth went from 1.9 to 0.5 percent. (See sidebar “A detailed 
economy-sector view of the productivity slowdown and the mix effect.”)

38 Robert Anderton et al. provide an illustrative example. In advanced OECD economies, the average “restrictiveness index” of 

regulation in network sectors (energy, transport, and communications) dropped from 5.2 out of 6.0 in 1980 to 1.8 in 2008, then 
flatlined. The OECD Product Market Regulation in energy, transport, communication and regulation (PMR ETCR) indicator 
is an index scaled from 0 to 6 (a low value corresponds to light regulation). It covers seven nonmanufacturing subsectors 
(telecommunications, electricity, gas, post, rail, air passenger transport, and road freight) in which anticompetitive regulation 
tends to be concentrated. See also Robert Anderton, Benedetta Di Lupidio, and Barbara Jarmulska, Product market

Investing in productivity growthA detailed economy-sector view of the productivity slowdown and the mix effect

One way to decompose productivity 
growth, from the sector perspective, is into 
“within” and “mix” effects.1 The within effect 
captures the impact of labor productivity 
growth in each sector, while the mix effect 
captures the impact of reallocation of labor 
across sectors. A shift of economic activity 
to low-productivity sectors (for example, 
from manufacturing to food services) can 
cause a drag on productivity and is often 
blamed for the slowdown. 

As discussed earlier, the within effect in 
manufacturing contributed more than 
50 percent of the productivity growth 
slowdown in advanced economies. 
Electronics manufacturing was the largest 
contributor within the sector, despite 
representing no more than 2 percent of 

employment across economies (Exhibit A). 
Other sectors had more heterogeneous, 
lower-magnitude impacts. For example, 
mining, construction, and professional 
and administrative services generally had 
a small positive effect, while agriculture, 
transportation, and financial services had a 
small negative impact. 

The mix effect was small across economies. 
Taking an aggregate view, had the United 
States kept its 1997 sector mix constant, its 
annual productivity growth between 1997 
and 2019 would have been 0.1 percentage 
point higher.2 Negative trends (the shrinking 
of sectors with above-average productivity, 
like manufacturing, and the growth of 
lower-productivity sectors, like healthcare) 
were largely offset by workers shifting to 

high-productivity services such as ICT 
and professional, scientific, and technical 
activities. In our Western European sample 
economies, the mix drag was nonexistent 
over this period.3

In the United States, for example, the 
largest change in sectoral share from 
1997 to 2019 was a 5.5-percentage-point 
decline in employment in manufacturing, 
a sector that had about 20 to 30 percent 
higher productivity than the economy’s 
average in that period (Exhibit B). This shift 
reduced overall productivity by 1 percent, 
but over a 22-year period, that translates 
to just a 0.06-percentage-point lower 
annual growth rate. The bottom line is that 
while the mix effect is worth watching, its 
aggregate impact has so far been small.

1  Our analysis first decomposes aggregate total economy labor productivity growth into a “within” and a “mix” effect using a Marshall–Edgeworth decomposition.  

A key characteristic of this decomposition is that it does not contain a composite (or error) component. In this formulation, labor productivity growth between time  
periods t–1 and t, LPt, is given by

       where i refers to sector, LP is productivity growth, and L is employment.

  The first term in the equation refers to the within effect (composed of sector productivity change and average employment weight), while the second and third terms refer 

to the mix effect (composed of employment weight change and sector productivity relative to total economy average productivity). For further discussion of decomposition 
methodology, refer to Javier Huerga and Lucia Stklacova, An application of index numbers theory to interest rates, European Central Bank working paper number 929, 
September 2008; and Thomas von Brasch et al., An exact additive decomposition of the weighted arithmetic mean, Statistics Norway, discussion paper number 944, 
September 2021. 

2  Estimates for total economy, excluding real estate sector. 
3  Our findings on the mix effect are consistent with a large body of literature, including Solving the productivity puzzle: The role of demand and the promise of digitization,

Investing in productivity growthHowever, digitization has not made the same impact on productivity in other sectors—at least not 
yet. Three reasons might account for this: the time required for technology adoption and creative 
destruction, the less transformational nature of current innovation, and mismeasurement. 

The first and most convincing argument is that digital and technological adoption is a long-run 
phenomenon. There are multiple historical precedents for a lag between the invention of a 
technology and its impact on productivity, from electricity in the early 20th century to computers 
and IT systems toward the end of it.43 In fact, the early years of a new technology may generate 
a drag on productivity growth before it can be usefully adapted, with productivity following a 
J-shaped trajectory.44 Digitization has also led to duplication of online and offline channels, giving 
customers more choice but delivering productivity benefits only when the offline channels are 
rationalized or discontinued. Finally, diffusing digital technologies across small businesses can 
be slow and difficult.45

A second proposed reason is that digital and other innovations of the past decade may be simply 
less transformational than past innovations.46 But looking ahead, there is reason for optimism 
about the effects manifesting. Previous MGI research has estimated that digitization and other 
technological advances could add 0.5 to 1.0 percent to annual productivity growth, which is 
substantial.47 In healthcare, for example, telemedicine could account for up to 1.5 percentage 
points per year through better care quality, less time lost in waiting rooms, and better back-end 
processes. Other research, including from MGI, has argued that more recent advances such as AI 
could have an even larger impact on productivity growth.48

Last, it may be that current measures of productivity do not capture the increases in value added 
that these technologies promote. Many new benefits are incorporated into products or services 
free of charge, for example, which means productivity statistics do not capture them. The best 
available evidence suggests that mismeasurement might explain up to 10 percent of the overall 
slowdown in productivity growth, a relevant but comparatively small effect.49

43 See, for example, Paul A. David, “The dynamo and the computer: An historical perspective on the modern productivity paradox,” 
American Economic Review, volume 80, number 2, May 1991. In 1987, Robert Solow famously said, “You can see the computer 
age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”

3. Emerging economies: 
The fast lane to prosperity

Over the past 25 years, emerging economies in the fast lane of productivity growth have caught 
up with advanced economies, with China and India at the forefront. 

In this section, we map our three lanes against five factors commonly called out in development 
economics literature and find a strong match—as well as interesting nuance:

1.  Radically high capital investment, at 20 to 40 percent of GDP, is the standout driver of  
rapid productivity growth, in most cases underpinning at least 70 to 80 percent of it. 

This investment is deployed into:

2.  Building cities in the right way and mechanizing agriculture, moving workers off the farm  

and into urban construction and service sectors;

3.  Achieving distinctive productivity growth within these expanding service sectors, where 

capital deepening is instrumental to creating formal productive jobs; and

4.  Making manufacturing more sophisticated and global, driving its output and value added 

beyond commodities (although often not adding employment). 

All of this is enabled by:

5.  Solid institutions, innovation, and education, all of which support investment but also  

require it.

Fast-lane economies are generally high performers across these five factors (Exhibit 13). 
Middle-lane economies have either not put some of the building blocks in place or have done 
so less successfully, while slow-lane economies have faced structural challenges such as weak 
institutions and high commodity dependence. Interestingly, workforce shifts from agriculture 
into services turn out to be of lesser importance in distinguishing the lanes. What matters is 
building cities and their service sectors in the right way, with significant capital investment and 
formal jobs.

To understand how fast-lane economies have outpaced other emerging economies, we have 
used sector data for 54 economies that represent 87 percent of emerging economies’ GDP.50 To 
illustrate our findings, we have selected 18 example economies (six each from the fast, middle, 
and slow lanes); they represent all regions and 72 percent of emerging economies’ GDP.51 For 

50 Out of the sample of 91 emerging economies from The Conference Board data set used in previous chapters, the analyses 
on sector mix and productivity are based on a sample of 54 economies: 43 economies from the Groningen Growth and 
Development Centre (GGDC) plus 11 Central European and Eastern European EU-member economies from EU KLEMS, 
because GGDC does not include economies from Central and Eastern Europe. The 43 emerging economies from GGDC 
represent 82 percent of the GDP of our Conference Board sample of emerging economies (91 economies), while the 11 
Central European and Eastern European economies represent about 40 percent of GDP of the Central European and Eastern 
European regions in the Conference Board sample. The 11 economies analyzed with EU KLEMS data are Bulgaria, Croatia, 
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The Russian Federation 
accounts for roughly three-quarters of the GDP of Central European and Eastern European economies in the Conference 
Board sample, but the EU KLEMS sample does not include it. Many analyses in this section stop in 2018 because that is the last 
year for which GGDC data is available.

51 The 18 sample economies we present for the sector analysis are large, representative economies from all regions. They 

represent more than 85 percent of GDP and population in the fast lane, more than 30 percent in the middle lane, and more  
than 50 percent in the slow lane.

Investing in productivity growthanalyses of additional factors such as urbanization, commodity dependence, and education, we 
cover all the economies represented in previous chapters.52

Fast-lane economies invest more than the rest 

Growth in capital per worker accounted for about four-fifths of productivity growth in most 
emerging regions over the past 25 years and for much of the difference in productivity growth 
between lanes, as seen in section 1. Most fast-lane economies managed to sustain investment at 
20 to 40 percent of their GDP over the whole period.

Residential and commercial property are essential for the urbanization that raises growth and 
productivity in a modern economy. Infrastructure investments make transportation and utilities 
more productive and produce spillovers across the economy. Machinery and equipment, 
from traditional types to new sophisticated robots, complement all sorts of workers’ tasks. 
Investment in R&D and other intangibles enables manufacturing to diversify and become more 
complex and productive, and it raises productivity in all types of services, from hospitals to 
digital and IT systems. 

This is not to say that higher investment is always good, or that what economies invest in does 
not matter. As economies develop and returns on investment decline, rebalancing to lower 
investment and higher consumption is natural. Investment can stay too high for too long, ignoring 
low returns, which can be particularly destabilizing if it is funded by debt instead of savings. 
But on the whole, higher investment has been associated empirically with higher output and 
productivity growth, lower inflation, better fiscal and external balances, and lower poverty rates 
and inequality.53

China, Ethiopia, India, Poland, Türkiye, and Vietnam make up our sample set of fast-lane 
economies, and their high rates of investment multiplied their ratio of capital stock per worker 
(Exhibit 14).

Higher investment is associated 
with higher output and productivity 
growth, lower inflation, better fiscal 
and external balances, and lower 
poverty rates and inequality.

52 Of the 91 emerging economies from the Conference Board data set (fast, middle, and slow lanes), the data sets for commodity 
dependence from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and for urbanization, institutions, 
education, and R&D data from the World Bank’s world development indicators cover most of them, about 85 economies each, 
with some differences. Commodities and development report 2023, UNCTAD, October 2023.

In these fast-lane economies, policies set strong and stable incentives for private investment. 
They included opening markets to some level of competition and foreign investment, setting up 
efficient financial sectors, and establishing legal systems to protect ownership rights. Central 
and Eastern European economies that were integrated into the EU drew in foreign investment 
and consolidated their financial sectors. From 2004 to 2008, one-fifth of the $220 billion 
(€168 billion) of net foreign direct investment inflows to Central and Eastern Europe went into 
the financial sector.54 Much of the rest went to modernize outdated factories and production 
methods. For example, vehicle production more than doubled between 2000 and 2011, while 
employment in the sector rose only 60 percent, resulting in a significant productivity increase.

54 A new dawn: Reigniting growth in Central and Eastern Europe, McKinsey Global Institute, December 2013.

34

Investing in productivity growth

Large companies drive investment and growth, making it important to help firms scale up.55 
Larger entities have more capacity to invest and export, to adopt technology, to develop talent, 
to pay their workers better wages, and to adapt to shocks. Many emerging economies have 
large shares of small, informal businesses that find it hard to boost productivity, affecting 
development.56

Fast-lane economies also had the willingness and capacity to plow public money into critical 
infrastructure such as road and railway networks, power and telecommunication systems, 
health and education facilities, and other urban infrastructure. Ethiopia’s impressive pace relied 
in large part on public investment, while China’s capital stocks were 86 percent public by 1997 
after nearly two decades of high state investment.57 When this type of investment is very high, 
however, it eventually starts yielding lower returns. In China, for instance, public capital stock 
is already at OECD levels, but private capital per worker is still well below that point, despite 
remarkable increases.58 This suggests there is scope for faster growth of private capital.

Slow- and middle-lane economies did not enjoy this pace of public or private investment growth. 
Even lower-income economies such as Cameroon and Pakistan that had very low capital 
stock per worker in 1997, comparable to China and India, achieved very little growth. Without 
enough savings and the policy settings to attract private and foreign investment, and without 
the capacity for public investment, they did not build the infrastructure, plant, machinery, and 
human capital needed to improve productivity growth. For example, 18 percent of Africa’s urban 
population still lacks access to electricity, and 66 percent has no access to piped water and 
sewerage systems.59

Urbanization shifts workers away from farms 
and into services and construction

Enabled by investment in infrastructure, urbanization has meant a major shift in the composition 
of economies, away from agriculture and into the construction and service-sector jobs that 
concentrate in cities (Exhibit 15). The urban share of the population in emerging economies 
has increased on average by nearly ten percentage points over the past quarter century, with 
remarkable cases across regions (China’s share grew by 31 percentage points, Costa Rica’s 
by 26 points, Albania’s by 24 points, and Botswana’s by 22 points). Urbanization itself is a 
weaker differentiator of fast-lane economies than the other factors discussed in this section; 
many middle- and slow-lane economies also urbanized rapidly. How urbanization is harnessed 
is what makes the difference.60 Fast-lane economies were better able to develop their cities’ 
infrastructure and buildings as their workforce was moving there, creating an environment more 
conducive to investment, growth, and prosperity. Growth in construction jobs was generally 
higher in fast-lane economies. In China, India, and Vietnam, the share of workers in construction 
increased by five to 12 percentage points.

GDP, was about 80 percent higher in 2021 relative to GDP than the average for the United States and Europe, justifiable only in 
support of very rapid growth expectations.

60 See, for example, Somik Lall et al., Pancakes to pyramids: City form to promote sustainable growth, World Bank, June 2021. 
The authors argue that some cities grow as “pyramids” (tall and agglomerated) and others as “pancakes” (flat and sprawling). 
Pyramids are generally better at growing productivity and driving prosperity while ensuring livability and respecting planetary 
boundaries. Pancakes are less efficient at achieving those goals and, for example, more prone to the emergence of slums. 
According to the latest UN data, the proportion of urban populations living in slums in Sub-Saharan Africa has been falling in 
the past two decades but in 2020 still stood at 50 percent.

Well-managed cities have all the ingredients to activate the virtuous cycle of rising productivity, 
income, and demand. As workers move to cities and secure better, more productive jobs, they 
earn the higher wages that boost both savings and consumption. Higher consumption gives 
business the incentive to invest, and savings fund the investment—which, in turn, makes workers 
more productive, restarting the cycle. 

Across our sample of 54 economies, an average of roughly one-sixth of the workforce left 
agriculture from 1997 to 2018. In China, agriculture fell from 50 to 27 percent of the workforce, 
with 150 million people leaving the sector.61 Vietnam’s share dropped from 70 to 38 percent, and 
Romania halved its share, from 40 to 19 percent. 

61 In some economies, the absolute value of workers in agriculture grew, but at a slower pace than in other sectors, resulting in a 
significant decrease in agriculture employment share across all sample economies. That was accompanied by growing total 
real value added in agriculture in all our sample economies, except for Poland, where it slightly decreased.

36

Investing in productivity growth

Urbanization’s productivity boost in emerging economies is due both to workers leaving the 
low-productivity agriculture sector (the mix effect) and to better performance in the agriculture 
sector itself (the within effect) as it mechanized or lost redundant labor (Exhibit 16). In fast-
lane economies, agriculture contributed to roughly one-third of all productivity growth from 
1997 to 2018. In these economies, across regions, the employment share and often even total 
employment in agriculture decreased, yet total output nearly doubled. 

In emerging economies where urbanization started earlier, the productivity impact of agriculture 
was understandably lower. In 1997, Central and Eastern European economies had a relatively small

Growing service-sector jobs have distinctively high 
productivity growth in fast-lane economies

Across lanes, most of the workers leaving agriculture entered services. But fast-lane economies 
invested to enhance the productivity of these service sectors even as they industrialized.

One central tenet of development economics is that industrialization is the main way to boost 
productivity growth; by contrast, increasing service-sector productivity is hard.62 While 
manufacturing is still extremely relevant, we find that many fast-lane economies achieved 
notably high productivity growth in services, too.

Reallocating workers toward services in itself does not always translate into a large productivity 
boost. In fact, in most cases, more than 60 percent of the workers who entered services went 
into relatively low-productivity subsectors such as wholesale and retail trade or transportation.63 
For example, while 15 percent of China’s workforce entered services between 1997 and 2018, 
that added only 0.2 percentage point to productivity growth, as about 80 percent of the workers 
joined low-productivity services.

What matters to the success of fast-lane economies is the push to raise productivity within 
services (Exhibit 17). This includes gains in the lower-productivity service sectors mentioned 
above (such as the spread of modern-format stores in retail) as well as in higher-productivity 
sectors such as business and financial services. 

A substantial share of fast-lane productivity gains was likely due to investment in physical 
and human capital. India’s early upgrading of digital infrastructure and workforce skills in the 
1990s enabled it to become a global IT leader, especially in software, for example.64 Other types 
of infrastructure, such as transport services, matter as well. Central and Eastern European 
economies raised productivity in services markedly due in no small part to their ability to attract 
significant foreign direct investment.65

What matters to the success 
of fast-lane economies is the 
push to raise productivity 
within services.

62 Joe Studwell, How Asia works: Success and failure in the world’s most dynamic region, Grove Press, 2014.
63 Since these services generally had productivity levels similar to average economy productivity, this shift alone did not result in 

high productivity growth at first.

In fast-lane economies, manufacturing sectors have become more  
sophisticated and global

Fast-lane economies of different income levels were able to outpace other emerging economies 
in the race to industrialize. They raised growth in manufacturing productivity—and output—
largely through building more complex supply chains, producing more sophisticated products, 
and plugging into global value chains. 

Whether economies can still industrialize their way to prosperity, as some East Asian economies 
did in the past, is an ongoing and lively debate in development economics.66 Our findings suggest 

66 See, for example, Dani Rodrik and Joseph E. Stiglitz, A new growth strategy for developing nations, Harvard University, January 2024.

39

Investing in productivity growth  
that manufacturing, including via exports, has continued to be a common way for emerging 
economies to raise productivity, despite only rare instances in the past quarter century in 
which the sector significantly expanded employment. In contrast to services, the share of 
manufacturing jobs in fast-lane economies, except for a few that started from a very low base, 
either stayed flat or fell (Exhibit 18).67

67 A common error is to conflate manufacturing with industry. The share of industrial employment did indeed grow in China in 
the past 25 years, which some may interpret as manufacturing growth. The reality is that the growth of Chinese industrial 
employment was almost entirely driven by the construction sector, not by manufacturing.

40

Investing in productivity growth  
In China, manufacturing was the single most important driver of productivity, adding 2.6 
percentage points in annual growth. Manufacturing also contributed strongly to productivity 
growth in fast-lane Central and Eastern European economies such as Romania (1.4 percentage 
points), Slovakia (1.4 points), and Poland (1.0 point). 

These gains were achieved, in many cases, once economies already had a relatively large 
manufacturing sector (about 20 percent of total employment), without increasing the sector’s 
share of employment. In fact, in three of the six fast-lane economies in our sample, the sector’s 
share of workers actually fell or held steady: China went from 22 to 20 percent, Türkiye dropped 
from 20 to 18 percent, and Poland stayed at 22 percent.68 India experienced very limited growth 
in manufacturing’s share of employment, starting from a low base. Only Ethiopia and Vietnam, 
starting even lower, managed to grow their manufacturing employment substantially. 

Manufacturing provides a channel for the kind of investment in R&D and innovation that helps 
drive overall productivity growth; trade in manufactured goods within a global value chain 
accelerates that growth. A strong manufacturing sector also enables economies to produce the 
basic materials and capital goods they need for urbanization, infrastructure, and mechanization 
in other sectors. Fast-lane economies pursued each of these factors more than those in the 
slower lanes; many of the latter relied more on commodity exports.

R&D-rich, globally integrated manufacturing supports the evolution to a more diversified and 
sophisticated economic fabric. Indeed, fast-lane countries have above-average economic 
complexity, a measure of the diversity and sophistication of the products that an economy is 
capable of producing. This capability is an indication of a country’s economic development and 
competitiveness.69 China has increased its economic complexity toward advanced-economy 
levels (Exhibit 19).

Trade in manufactured goods amplifies the productivity dividend, especially when it is part of 
a global value chain. Trading firms learn faster and are more competitive at home and abroad.70 
When they are part of a global value chain, companies are also able to specialize in core tasks 
and access inputs and knowledge from their foreign partners. Greater exports are also an 
important source of demand, providing economies with the incentives and revenues to invest in 
capital goods and technology. 

Where fast-lane economies benefit from economic complexity and trade, slow-lane 
economies may suffer from excessive reliance on resources. On average, 78 percent of the 
goods exported by slow-lane economies are commodities, about double the share in fast-lane 
economies and advanced economies.71 This dependence makes economies more vulnerable  
to global shocks and impedes their industry-driven productivity growth.72 High-value 
commodity exports also put upward pressure on the exchange rate, making exports less 
competitive. This, in turn, discourages investment in tradable sectors and accelerates the 
growth of nontradable services.73

68 These peak values are consistent with the premature deindustrialization theory, which holds that manufacturing employment 

starts to peak earlier after the 1990s, and with a maximum close to 20 percent. See Dani Rodrik, Premature deindustrialization, 
November 2015.

Solid and improving enablers pave the way to the fast lane

Strong investment and productivity growth can only be built on a firm foundation. Knowing the 
necessary conditions for economic development and growth is the holy grail of economics. The 
drivers are many, and the circumstances and extent to which they drive productivity growth are 
hotly debated. Some research institutions have built lists of productivity drivers, including the 
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index of 12 drivers and the World Bank’s 2019 
Global Productivity framework of ten.74 There is also a question about whether it takes a certain 
level of each enabler to achieve a large acceleration in productivity or whether improvements in 
each driver are enough. The answer is probably a combination. In this section, we focus on three 
enablers: institutions, innovation (through R&D), and human capital. 

Effective institutions are fundamental to long-run growth, through both effective public 
intervention and creating the rules of the game in which businesses invest and thrive. From the 

74 The World Economic Forum’s index consists of 12 pillars, including institutions, human capital (skills), and innovation, among 
others. The World Bank’s drivers are demography, investment, geography, gender equality, trade, education, urbanization, 
economic complexity, institutions, and innovations. The global competitiveness report 2019, World Economic Forum, 2019; and 
Alistair Dieppe, ed., Global productivity: Trends, drivers, and policies, World Bank, 2019.

Investing in productivity growth 
vast literature on institutions and productivity growth,75 we have selected pillar 1 from the World 
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index to analyze our lanes. This pillar, measuring the 
relative strength of institutions, includes metrics for government performance, property rights, 
transparency, security, and a lack of corruption, among other things.76 On a scale from 0 (worst) to 
100 (best), the average score of advanced economies is 71. Fast-lane economies have an average 
of 56, middle-lane economies 52, and slow-lane economies 48. 

Investment in R&D is a simple proxy for an economy’s capacity to innovate. Fast-lane economies 
invest on average nearly 1 percent of their GDP in R&D, compared with 0.6 percent and 
0.4 percent by middle- and slow-lane economies.77 China has dramatically increased investment 
in R&D, from 0.6 percent of GDP in 1997 to 2.2 percent in 2019, matching the advanced-economy 
average for that year. Economies in Central Europe lifted their R&D investment from 0.6 percent 
to 1.0 percent over that quarter century. Economies in Latin America, many of which are in the 
slow lane, invest only 0.2 percent of GDP in R&D. The region accounts for less than 2 percent of 
the world’s patent applications, and of these, less than one-fifth are filed by Latin Americans.78

The third enabler we examined is education, or productive investment in human capital.79 Ample 
literature supports the relevance of human capital as a driver of economic development.80 A 
simple measure of education is learning-adjusted years of schooling in the working population. 
Advanced economies average about 11.0 years, fast-lane economies 9.0 years, middle-lane 
economies 7.5 years, and slow-lane economies 6.0 years. 

Regions with an overrepresentation of slow-lane economies are significantly weaker when 
it comes to these enablers. For example, Latin America’s growth has long been held back by 
underdeveloped financial sectors and certain regulations that block investment. Weak public 
institutions and governance also limit government capacity to reduce the region’s considerable 
gaps in human capital, technology, and infrastructure.81

Similar factors affect economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite significant differences in income 
levels. Political instability can add to this story. Previous MGI work found that coups and other political 
events affected 30 percent of Africa’s population in the 2010s, compared with 4 percent in the 
2000s.82 After peaking in 2008, foreign direct investment flows into Africa declined in 31 of Africa’s 54 
economies, falling fastest in the continent’s two largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa.

Strong and improving foundations in institutions, education, and innovation are three of the 
most relevant enablers of productivity growth. They require—and also unleash—the necessary 
investments that are critical to moving economies into the fast lane.

approximate the age-specific enrollment rates for four- and five-year-olds; the primary rate approximates for six- to 11-year-

4. An agenda for productivity 
growth in a changing  
geo-economic era

Our diagnosis suggests priorities for advanced economies: a focus on revamping investment and 
harvesting the productivity dividend from digital and other technologies such as AI. Conversely, 
commonly raised solutions such as reshoring manufacturing and trying to influence the sector 
mix are less likely to reaccelerate productivity growth. Improving how we measure GDP and 
productivity is a worthwhile pursuit, but the drivers of the slowdown outlined in this research have 
been real and keenly felt regardless of measurement.

We also outline the priorities for emerging economies to get to the fast lane: boost capital 
investment, build on that investment to urbanize effectively, grow the productivity and size of the 
service and construction sectors, and increase the sophistication and global interconnectedness 
of manufacturing.

In this last section, we explore the future of productivity growth by posing seven questions. 
Because we cover the full range of global economies with different characteristics, we 
necessarily focus on general points. The first two questions—linked to investment and 
technology—focus on what is needed to reverse the slowdown and position economies for high 
productivity growth in a changing era. The final five explore how future productivity growth will 
be shaped by the big puzzles on the horizon: shrinking and aging populations in many economies, 
including most advanced economies and China; new ways of working; the growing importance of 
services; trade tensions and supply-chain disruptions; and energy costs. 

1. Can we revamp investment and demand in a changing  
macro environment? 

If there is a common thread in this report, it is the importance of investment. Fully half of the 
drop-off in productivity growth in advanced economies is a slowdown in capital deepening (that 
is, the growth of capital per worker). High capital deepening is also the key characteristic of 
emerging economies in the fast lane. 

Investment flows best in “high-pressure” economies that enjoy strong demand, strong growth, 
and low unemployment. Inflationary pressure and rising interest rates could be signs that we are 
leaving behind secular stagnation and entering an era of higher demand and investment. Higher 
real wages may motivate more capital investment, too.83 Although it is too soon to tell, some signs 
appear positive, particularly in the United States. Real GDP beat expectations by growing at 
annualized rates of 4.9 and 3.3 percent in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, respectively; this 
was largely driven by equally high productivity growth.84 Aggregate metrics show that investment 

83 The future of wealth and growth hangs in the balance, McKinsey Global Institute, May 2023.
84 See “Gross domestic product, fourth quarter and year 2023 (advance estimate),” US Bureau of Economic Analysis, January 
2024; and “Major sector productivity and costs: Nonfarm business, labor productivity (output per hour),” US Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, February 2024.

45

Investing in productivity growthis up from pandemic lows, though it still has a long way to go. Anecdotally, the big five US tech 
firms spent $350 billion among them on R&D and capital expenditures in 2022, as part of a race 
for supremacy in AI and the cloud.85 Construction activity in the US manufacturing sector is two 
to three times its normal level, driven in part by a rush to build battery supply chains.86

Advanced economies might also tilt regulatory conditions in favor of investment and innovation. 
Priorities would include reducing unwarranted burden and complexity (for example, for permits 
to build renewable power), more effective market regulation, fixing land markets to facilitate 
building, and better intellectual property and competition policies. Creating the right balance of 
competition and entrepreneurship would motivate new waves of investment. In the United States, 
business dynamism shot up in 2020 and kept pace through 2023.87

Emerging economies would benefit from public and private investment in urban infrastructure 
and in the public services and worker skills that make cities function. While people moving from 
farms to cities is a major lever for productivity growth, it can result in “sterile agglomeration” 
without the right hard and soft investments.88 The focus can also extend to secondary cities  
with large potential.89 This requires creating savings or borrowing power to unleash that 
investment. However, emerging economies may find funding hard to come by. In the aftermath 
of the COVID-19 crisis, growing debt distress could be a limitation, and investors may be more 
attracted to the higher interest rates available again in advanced economies.90

An attractive business environment therefore becomes even more important. This includes 
low corruption, nimble regulation, high-quality financial markets, and macroeconomic stability, 
all of which have proved to be persistent challenges in many parts of the world. Solving these 
issues would not only help attract foreign capital but also activate the virtuous cycle of rising 
productivity, incomes, demand, and domestic savings. Greater investment in a more favorable 
business environment would help businesses grow, allowing them in turn to invest in productive 
capital, hire and develop talent, pay higher wages, and compete in international markets. 
Developing large leading firms while keeping up competitive pressure would be a major spur  
of productivity growth in emerging economies.

2. Can we harness the promise of technology for a more  
productive future? 

Productivity tends to accelerate in waves. As mentioned, digitization and other technological 
advances could add 0.5 to 1.0 percentage point to annual productivity growth in advanced 
economies.91 Early adoption of recent advances such as generative AI could add an extra boost 
of more than 0.5 percentage point across advanced (and several emerging) economies by 
transforming how jobs are done.92

Investing in productivity growth

Digitization has been the main promise for a productivity boost over the past decade, but its 
benefits will materialize beyond the ICT sector only with faster creative destruction, market share 
shifts, and the adoption of technologies, ideas, and best practices. Several AI applications hold 
significant productivity potential, and there are signs that they could expand faster than previous 
technologies.93 While the direction and impact of AI are uncertain (and big claims about any new 
technological solution are often overblown), several proven productivity-enhancing use cases 
have already emerged.94

In emerging economies, wider adoption of existing technologies—for example, smartphones—
rather than frontier innovation can go even further in boosting productivity, but sometimes this 
process takes time and must overcome barriers. For instance, Latin America has generally 
been a latecomer to technologies. But the pandemic boosted the adoption of technology such 
as digital payments and e-commerce, which could trigger catch-up growth. Yet as frontier 
technologies such as AI take off, the region risks lagging once again: estimates suggest that AI’s 
impact on Latin America’s economy will be three to five times lower than in North America and 
China.95 Opportunities in digital technology adoption abound in Africa, too. Simpler, nondigital 
technologies can also significantly boost productivity. Further irrigation and fertilizer investment, 
for example, promise much for Africa’s agricultural sectors.96

3. Can we reshape the effects of aging on productivity? 

Demographics will continue to affect both the supply side (worker availability and individual 
productivity) and demand side (consumer spend) of the economy, and hence aggregate 
productivity. While there is no consensus in the literature, studies suggest that young workers 
get more productive as they grow older and then decline in productivity as they near retirement, 
with the turning point varying between sectors. Simply, it is not good to be too young, because 
workers lack the learning effects that come with experience, but it is also not good to be too 
old, because many occupations show productivity peaking at midlife. Estimates based on 
econometric studies are associated with some difficulties, and the ranges found are large (from  
a positive impact of aging on productivity growth to a 0.5-percentage-point productivity drag 
per year, depending on the economy and the time period).97

Globally, the number of working-age people per person over 65 will shrink from 6.6 in 2022 to 
3.8 in 2050.98 Advanced economies and China, in particular, are now in a synchronized march into

mitigating or turning around the effects of aging through reskilling, rethinking retirement policies, 
and other means. They might also target the growing “silver economy” of older consumers, 
creating new markets with more and better products and services. 

Emerging economies with young and fast-growing workforces hold a great asset. Their talent 
has the potential not only to increase domestic productivity but also to support aging populations 
elsewhere. Africa, home of the world’s youngest and fastest-growing population, will add almost 
800 million people to its working population by 2050, overtaking China and India.100

4. Can we make hybrid work work?

During the pandemic, people worked from home in significant numbers perhaps for the first time, 
and part of this shift has stuck. The long-run productivity impact of hybrid work is yet to be seen, 
although it could be positive if properly structured and managed. 

Research shows that the effects of remote work are very sensitive to industry, role, and activity. 
For fully remote work, most studies show a loss in productivity per hour, which can be offset 
by more hours worked as commuting time is saved. Hybrid arrangements do tend to increase 
productivity if staged and managed properly, most studies show. On the one hand, early-stage 
innovation and brainstorming benefit from on-site exchange, as do training and mentoring, 
particularly for new employees. On the other hand, working remotely some days has a number 
of advantages: it promotes cross-office and cross-country connectivity; it can make happier 
workers put in greater effort; it allows for a quieter home environment for certain tasks; and it 
saves time through less commuting, shorter breaks, and less sick leave.101

In addition, remote work opens the option of completely outsourcing jobs to emerging 
economies, especially in services, which may drive a new wave of offshoring for economies  
with the right talent and infrastructure in place.

5. Can we drive productivity in services? 

For someone who has time traveled from the 1960s, our phone calls and computers, and how we 
build them, have changed beyond recognition. Yet a haircut or going to a hotel or a restaurant 
would be very familiar. While some specific service subsectors (financial services, professional 
services, and ICT) have shown higher productivity and productivity growth than manufacturing, 
services tend to be harder to transform and can be a drag on an economy’s productivity growth.

Increasing productivity in services is a major puzzle. Economies are becoming more and more 
service intensive, not least because manufacturing involves fewer jobs as it becomes more 
productive. As we have established, the mix effect in some advanced economies has exerted a 
constant small drag on productivity growth. (See sidebar “A detailed economy-sector view of 
the productivity slowdown and the mix effect” in section 2.) Advanced economies have been 

99  In Japan and the United States, for example, the number of retirees will keep growing over the next few decades, even though 
growth in the share of the total population aged over 60 has already peaked. China is heading in the direction of South Korea, 
and its trajectory is steeper than that of Japan in the past. Hannah Ritchie et al., “Population growth,” Our World in Data,

Investing in productivity growth

reweighting toward services for decades, and this trend is now apparent in most emerging 
economies, too. 

In any case, it is challenging for economies to influence their sector mix. Sector specialization 
depends on deep economic forces that are not simple to modify, and, more important, sector 
growth rates reflect changes in consumption patterns. This is why making services more 
productive is a more reliable and sustainable way to raise the aggregate productivity of the 
economy than other approaches.

For slow-growing emerging economies, solving this puzzle may be even more crucial. Even if 
opportunities exist, not every economy will be able to secure a manufacturing role in global 
supply chains to employ 15 or 20 percent of the population, especially as manufacturing 
becomes more automated. While manufacturing will remain an important source of productivity 
growth, services (both domestic and for export) will be crucial—probably increasingly so. 
Following the model of India, the mass export of digital and other services may be an option  
for several economies, both to increase overall productivity and to reduce dependence on 
volatile commodity exports.

6. Can we maintain high global cooperation?

The integration of global value chains unlocked huge productivity gains, both in the OECD and 
where new manufacturing capabilities were built. And while markers of global integration for 
physical goods plateaued in the years following the GFC, flows of services, data, and people 
have been steadily increasing. However, the pandemic interrupted global cooperation, which 
continues to be shaken by trade tensions, protectionist policies, wars, and other geopolitical 
events.102 If globalization recedes, it could hamper productivity growth in both advanced and 
emerging economies.

How global supply chains will reconfigure in the future is uncertain, and the shape of this 
reconfiguration will matter for productivity growth. If trade fragments along geopolitical lines, 
the impact on global growth may be substantial; some economies could lose up to 6 percent of 
GDP due to trade effects alone.103 The long-term impact on productivity growth could be more 
substantial if we also consider barriers to cross-border investment and reduced diffusion of 
ideas and technology across the globe.104 Meanwhile, there are indications that some emerging 
economies are beginning to assume larger roles in global trade networks. Annual greenfield 
investment in Africa (mainly North Africa) and India has surged by 109 percent and 54 percent, 
respectively, relative to prepandemic averages. Future reconfiguration may enable a new wave 
of economies to move into the fast lane, shifting them from commodity dependence to more 
complex exports. 

Finally, industrial policies that promote the reshoring of manufacturing in some advanced 
economies are on the rise but may not cause higher productivity growth.105 It was an offshoring

Investing in productivity growthwave—with employment growth falling while output kept growing—that led to fast productivity 
growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Trying to recover manufacturing jobs is unlikely to help 
productivity, since it is precisely the less productive tasks (and hence jobs) within global value 
chains that are generally offshored.

7. Can we reenergize productively? 

Global economies have embarked on one of the largest energy transitions in history, and it is 
uncertain if this will be a tailwind or a headwind for productivity. High energy intensity is key as 
economies industrialize. However, most advanced and several emerging economies have now 
decoupled their economic growth from greater energy usage.106 Energy costs account for only 
about 6 percent of GDP, meaning even large swings in energy costs may have a muted impact on 
productivity growth.107

In any case, in the short run, the increasing cost of energy, materials, and other resources weighs 
negatively on productivity. Managing the intermittency of some renewable sources can be costly, 
too. Investments to speed up the transition that are not yet “in the money”—and may take years 
or decades to yield positive returns—do not help productivity, either.

However, investment in clean energy and innovation can spur significant productivity and 
efficiency increases, particularly in the longer run.108 Productivity-enhancing benefits from 
energy-efficiency investments include increased output yields, shorter process cycle times, 
improved product quality, and improved machinery performance.109 While intermittence 
is a current limitation of many clean energy sources, generation costs have already fallen 
substantially, and the electrification of transportation, industry, and heating could lead to higher 
conversion efficiency. Additional productivity spillovers may emerge. For example, building 
electric vehicles requires less labor than building internal-combustion-engine vehicles.110

The need for critical new resources can also produce regional shifts and benefit some emerging 
economies, if well managed. Latin America, for instance, has a unique opportunity to support 
global decarbonization since it holds about half of the world’s lithium, 36 percent of its copper, 
and 16 percent of its nickel, all of which are critical for the net-zero transition.111

production into account,” Our World in Data, November 2021.

107 For example, see “Inflation-adjusted US energy spending increased by 25% in 2021,” US Energy Information Administration, 

August 3, 2023.

108 André et al. estimate that a 5 percent increase in energy prices reduces firm productivity by approximately 0.4 percent 

one year later. However, a shock corresponding to a 10 percent increase in energy prices is associated with an increase in 
productivity growth of about 0.9 percentage point four years after the shock. Christophe André et al., Rising energy prices

Investing in productivity growthProductivity growth is much more than an economic concept: it is at the core of shared 
prosperity. Businesses and policy makers in advanced and emerging economies alike need to 
take action and create the conditions to boost investment, which underlies the technological, 
economic, and social transformations that drive productivity. This will be critical as the world 
wrestles with the challenges and opportunities brought by the next era.
