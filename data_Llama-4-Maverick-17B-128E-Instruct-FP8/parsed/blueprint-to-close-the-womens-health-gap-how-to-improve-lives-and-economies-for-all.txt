Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: 
How to Improve Lives and Economies for All

Foreword

Company, Equity & Health 
Leader, McKinsey Health 
Institute, USA

Over the past year, we have been humbled and 
honoured to receive an outpouring of support and 
enthusiasm for our report, Closing the Women’s 
Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve 
Lives and Economies. While the numbers behind 
it may have come as a shock – that women spend 
25% more of their lives in poor health compared 
to men, or that the women’s health gap equates 
to 75 million years of life lost to poor health or 
early death per year – the report, the result of 
a collaboration by the World Economic Forum, 
the Global Alliance for Women’s Health and the 
McKinsey Health Institute, tapped into what many 
readers instinctively felt: when it comes to health, 
women are second-class citizens.

This year, we offer a deeper framework to help 
close the women’s health gap: count women, study 
women, include all women in research and efforts 
to improve care and invest in women and girls 
throughout their lifespan. We also highlight how nine 
conditions are driving a third of the women’s health 
gap: the lifespan conditions of ischaemic heart 
disease, breast cancer, post-partum haemorrhage, 
cervical cancer and maternal hypertensive disorder; 
and the health-span conditions of premenstrual 
syndrome, menopause, endometriosis and 
migraines. Boosting data availability, care delivery, 
investment and treatment for the selected 
conditions could create nearly $400 billion in annual 
economic improvement by 2040. 

But today, all of us also live in an era of longer 
lifespans, technological innovation, rapid scientific 
breakthroughs, economic acumen and the ability to 
advocate for public policy. Global life expectancy 
has more than doubled over the past 200+ years, 
with economists estimating that about a third of 
economic growth in advanced economies in the 
past century has been tied to improvements in 
the health of global populations.1,2 Healthcare 
investments improve the quality of life and gross 
domestic product growth up to three times the 
investment in high-income countries.3 These 
returns on investment boost the business case 
for improving women’s health and speaking up for 
those who are struggling the most. 

Focusing on these selected conditions allows us to 
build a blueprint that, in the future, will be expanded 
to provide a comprehensive view of women’s 
health and accelerate progress towards closing the 
women’s health gap.

Progress happens only when we work towards 
it together and measure improvement. We invite 
you to join us on the next step of this journey, 
to improve and save the lives of women and 
strengthen economies and continue to demonstrate 
the business case for investing in women’s health.

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllExecutive summary
Nine selected conditions drive a third 
of the women’s health gap – reducing 
their effects could create around $400 
billion in annual global GDP by 2040.

Women live 25% more of their lives in poor health 
when compared to men. Closing the Women’s 
Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve 
Lives and Economies, published by the World 
Economic Forum in collaboration with the McKinsey 
Health Institute (MHI) in 2024, found that closing the 
health gap between men and women could unlock 
75 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
annually and $1 trillion in annual global GDP.4 
Closing the women’s health gap would be the 
equivalent of adding seven healthy days per year for 
each woman.5 Addressing the drivers of the gap – 
treatment efficacy, care delivery, data and funding 
– could help to extend women’s healthy lives and 
capture the aligned and substantial economic 
benefits. This report takes the next step: a blueprint 
for closing the women’s health gap and improving 
lives and economies around the world. (For more 
on how this report defines women’s health, see 
“Terminology”.)

Urgent actions needed to close the women’s 
health gap are illuminated when examining in 
detail nine selected conditions that collectively 
account for a third of the women’s health gap. 
The selected conditions are women-specific, 
affect women differently or affect women 
disproportionately than men. This approach, which 
includes analysis of 15 countries across income 
archetypes, creates a blueprint that could readily 
scale to other countries and additional conditions 
affecting women and their health, with the goal 
of providing a comprehensive view of women’s 
health worldwide and inspiring stakeholders to act. 
Closing the women’s health gap for these selected 
conditions alone could add almost 27 million 
disability-adjusted life years annually, equating to 
2.5 additional healthy days per woman, per year, 
around the globe, and yield around $400 billion in 
annual GDP to the global economy. 

Selected conditions, in order of potential 
estimated annual gains in DALYs and GDP if the 
women’s health gap is closed by 2040:

Conditions that affect lifespan

 –

Ischaemic heart disease is the leading cause 
of death for women worldwide. Ischaemic heart 
disease represents potential estimated gains 
of 9.1 million annual DALYs and $43 billion in 
annual GDP in the women’s health gap.6 

 – Cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable 
with vaccination yet contributes to hundreds of 
thousands of deaths each year, mostly in LICs 
and LMICs. Cervical cancer represents potential 
estimated gains of 2.4 million annual DALYs 
and $10 billion in annual GDP in the women’s 
health gap.

 – Breast cancer is the most common cancer 
diagnosed in women globally. Breast cancer 
represents potential estimated gains of 1.2 
million annual DALYs and $8.7 billion in annual 
GDP in the women’s health gap.

 – Maternal hypertensive disorders are a leading 
cause of pregnancy complications for mothers 
and infants.7 Maternal hypertensive disorders 
represent potential estimated gains of 0.85 million 
annual DALYs and $1.4 billion in annual GDP in 
the women’s health gap.

 – Post-partum haemorrhage is the leading 
cause of maternal mortality worldwide and 
affects more than 14 million women each year. 
Post-partum haemorrhage represents potential 
estimated gains of 0.25 million annual DALYs 
and nearly $200 million in annual GDP in the 
women’s health gap.

Conditions that affect health span

 – Menopause and perimenopause, which can 
last for more than a decade, are estimated to 
affect more than 450 million women worldwide 
at any given time.8 Menopause represents 
potential estimated gains of 2.4 million annual 
DALYs and $120 billion in annual GDP in the 
women’s health gap.

4

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All – Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects 20–40% 
of women of reproductive age.9 PMS represents 
potential estimated gains of 2.1 million annual 
DALYs and $115 billion in annual GDP in the 
women’s health gap. 

 – Migraine affects approximately 21% of 

women globally (0.8 billion women).10 Migraine 
represents potential estimated gains of 2.7 
million annual DALYs and $80 billion in annual 
GDP in the women’s health gap.

 – Endometriosis is an oestrogen-related 

condition affecting one in 10 women between 
the ages of 15 and 45 – at least 190 million 
women globally.11 Endometriosis represents 
potential estimated gains of 0.25 million annual 
DALYs and $12 billion in annual GDP in the 
women’s health gap.

Measuring and tracking progress is an important 
and meaningful first step in the journey to equitable 
health and healthcare for women and girls. The 
Women’s Health Impact Tracking (WHIT) 
platform was created by the Global Alliance for 
Women’s Health to address this need. WHIT 
is designed to measure the impact of health 
conditions that contribute to the women’s health 
gap (in terms of disability, mortality and consequent 
economic effect). It also provides country-
level indicators of data availability, treatment 
effectiveness and quality and appropriateness of 
care delivery. WHIT was designed by stakeholders, 
for stakeholders, as a practical and tactical tool 
to track progress over time and shine a light on 
opportunities to accelerate the deployment of 
proven solutions to close the women’s health gap.

The imperative and actions stakeholders can take 
to close the women’s health gap can be explored 
with the following framework: 

Count women

Women’s health data is often 
not collected, not published in 

the public domain, or incomplete. Improving the 
accuracy of data collection and setting standards 
for sex- and gender-based data collection could 
help to clarify the true burden of disease, particularly 
for women-specific conditions. 

Study women

Research funding for women’s 
health and the drivers of sex-
based differences, particularly for conditions that 
affect the health span, is not proportional to the 
burden of disability attributed to these conditions. 
Sex-disaggregated analysis and basic science 
research into hormone health and female biology 
could help reveal how women are affected 
disproportionately or differently from men by many 
conditions. Additional research could help the 
understanding of conditions specific to women and 
illuminate disparities.

Care for women

Clinical practice guidelines 
(CPGs) often do not reflect 

best-practice clinical care for women, including 
the understanding of sex-based differences in the 
presentation and treatment of conditions. Delivering 
sex- and gender-appropriate and evidence-based 
healthcare, through healthcare delivery systems 
designed for women and equipped to address 
health-related social needs (HRSN), could improve 
health outcomes for women.

Include all women

Mitigating health disparities 
could have a greater 

impact on mortality for the selected conditions 
than any single treatment recently studied in later-
stage clinical trials. Health and social systems can 
consider how to better acknowledge and address 
differences in health outcomes and promote global 
health equity.

Invest in women

Additional funding in 
research, clinical education 

and training, care delivery and the development 
of innovative interventions is needed to accelerate 
progress. Each and every stakeholder has a role in 
advancing the health of women.

The impact of these actions can, and will, 
reach far beyond the lives of individual women. 
Healthier women are cornerstones of prosperous 
communities, vibrant workplaces and resilient 
economies. Better health for women throughout 
their lives could create at least $1 trillion in annual 
incremental economic growth by 2040.12 This is 
distinct from the market for new products and 
services that can be developed to address the 
many unmet needs of women today, the size 
of which may be more than $500 billion for the 
selected conditions. Investors, researchers, 
governments, non-profits, providers, life sciences 
companies and communities may want to 
reinvigorate their consideration and commitments  
to women’s health.

Empowering every woman and girl around the world 
with awareness and the information needed to take 
charge of her health is critical. Misinformation and 
decreasing awareness of women’s health stalls 
advancement and can impair women from living 
healthier and more productive lives.

Progress is possible, and closing the women’s 
health gap is achievable. Now is the time for 
action that will improve the lives of women and 
girls around the world and strengthen the  
global economy.

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllIntroduction
Women experience massive health 
inequities and poor health outcomes 
worldwide – and the global economy 
suffers as a result.

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion 
Opportunity to Improve Lives and Economies, 
published in 2024 by the World Economic Forum 
in collaboration with the McKinsey Health Institute, 
reported that the women’s health gap correlates with 
women living in poor health for 25% more of their lives 
when compared to men. Closing the women’s health 
gap could yield 75 million disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) annually – the equivalent of adding seven 
healthy days per year, per woman – and unlock $1 
trillion in annual global GDP by 2040. Now is the 
time for stakeholders to address drivers of the gap 
and improve the lives of women, communities and 
economies around the world. (For more on how this 
report defines women’s health, see “Terminology”.)

This year’s report provides a blueprint for developing 
a comprehensive, global view of women’s health 
and illuminates opportunities to help close the gap. 
The report examines nine selected conditions that 
account for a third of the women’s health gap, 
with analyses spanning 15 countries representing 
all income levels. The selected conditions depict 
a mix of conditions that are specific to women, 
affect women disproportionately or affect women 
differently from men. Five of the conditions limit 
women’s lifespan, leading to early death, and 
four impair women’s health span, often causing 
significant distress and resulting in women living 
extended years in disability. 

Selected conditions, in order of annual potential 
estimated gains in DALYs and GDP if the women’s 
health gap is closed by 2040, prevalence rate, 
incidence rate and Global Alliance for Women’s 
Health members’ expert recommendations are 
below. For further details on this selection process, 
please refer to the technical appendix.

Conditions that affect lifespan

 – Maternal hypertensive disorder 

 – Post-partum haemorrhage

Conditions that affect health span

 – Menopause

 – Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)

 – Migraine

 – Endometriosis

Examining these conditions highlights potential 
opportunities for immediate progress and actions 
needed to close the women’s health gap over 
time. These actions can be explored with the 
following framework:

1.  Count women, by improving data collection 
methodologies and setting standards for sex- 
and gender-based data collection to increase 
understanding of women’s health. 

2.  Study women, by conducting research into 
women’s health and the drivers of sex-based 
differences, sex-disaggregating analyses and 
supporting basic science and clinical research 
that focuses on conditions specific to women 
across their lifespan. 

3.  Care for women, by adopting clinical practice 

guidelines that align with the accepted evidence 
for sex- and gender-based care and by 
enhancing clinical education and care delivery 
systems needed to effectively implement them. 

4.  Include all women in initiatives and progress, 
with a lens on heath equity and inclusion. 

 –

Ischaemic heart disease

5.  Invest in women, by funnelling resources 

 – Cervical cancer

 – Breast cancer

towards women’s health, from the bench to the 
bedside and beyond, to accelerate progress; 
and by supporting women in leadership 
positions across health and social systems.

Progress and actions needed to close the women’s health gap

Count women

Study women

Care for women

Include all women

Invest in women

Improve data collection 
methodologies and set 
standards for sex- and 
gender-based data 
collection to increase the 
understanding of 
women’s health

Conduct research into 
women’s health and the 
drivers of sex-based 
diﬀerences, undertake
sex-disaggregated analyses 
and support basic 
science and research that 
focuses on conditions 
speciﬁc to women across 
their lifespans

Adopt clinical practice 
guidelines that align with 
the accepted evidence for 
sex- and gender-based 
care, and enhance clinical 
education and the care 
delivery systems needed 
to eﬀectively implement 
them

Invest in research, clinical 
education, training and 
care delivery, with a lens 
on heath equity and 
inclusion

Funnel resources towards 
women’s health, from the 
bench to the bedside and 
beyond, to accelerate 
progress and support 
women in leadership 
positions

Together, these actions could initiate a global shift 
to close the women’s health gap. Based on recent 
Forum and MHI analyses and expertise from the 
Global Alliance for Women’s Health working groups, 
addressing health disparities could create greater 
impact on mortality for conditions affecting lifespan 
than any single treatment studied in recent clinical 
trials.13 Other actions, such as improving clinical 
practice guidelines and incorporating sex- and 
gender-based differences into clinical education and 
training, could help to overhaul a healthcare delivery 
system that was not designed for women and is 
underserving them. 

Addressing these areas could help to extend the 
health of women and capture the aligned and 
substantial economic benefits that come with a 
thriving population. Closing the women’s health gap 
for the selected conditions could contribute nearly 
$400 billion in annual GDP to the global economy 
and close the burden gap by almost 27 million 
DALYs each year, translating to 2.5 additional 
healthy days per year for each woman in the world.

These efforts can, and will, reach far beyond the 
lives of individual women. Investors, researchers, 
academics, non-profits, providers, life sciences 
companies and governments have reasons to 
improve the health of women. Healthier women 
are cornerstones of strong families, prosperous 
communities, vibrant workplaces and resilient 
economies. Better health for women throughout 
their lives could create at least $1 trillion in annual 
incremental economic growth by 2040.This is 
separate from the commercial market for new 
products and services that can be developed, 
which the Forum and MHI analysis shows could 
add more than $500 billion to the global economy 
by addressing the selected conditions alone. A 
substantial and strategic allocation of resources 

through cross-stakeholder commitments and 
collaboration could improve health outcomes for 
women globally, as would redesigning the health 
system to deliver equitable, high-value care. 
Stakeholder action throughout the women’s health 
ecosystem could accelerate progress, reduce health 
disparities and close the women’s health gap. 

In the past year, hearing from individuals and 
stakeholders who have shared their path to 
advancing the health of women has been inspiring. 
For many, their personal journeys drove them 
to become investors, advocates, educators or 
business leaders pushing to better understand 
women’s health at a global scale. For others, efforts 
are inspired by wanting to change outcomes for 
women, given that women’s health affects each  
and every person around the world. 

Initiatives that have launched in the past year 
include redesigning components of clinical 
education, investing in women-focused health 
start-ups, advancing biomedical research on 
sex-specific differences and hormone health and 
advocating for policy changes at local, national and 
international levels. 

This momentum should not be halted, as the need 
to highlight women’s health comes in an era in 
which competition for attention and awareness 
of any health topic – whether it is pushing for 
investment in women’s health-span conditions or 
reiterating care standards – may be increasingly 
challenging. The past year has, however, 
demonstrated that progress is possible on a short 
timeline, and that champions around the world 
are motivated to act. Now is the time to make a 
difference and expand the number of champions 
driving the agenda across the public, private and 
social sectors to close the women’s health gap.

Terminology

This report approaches women’s health as a 
market segment to facilitate focused analysis 
and navigate the complexities of studying such 
a multifaceted issue. The authors acknowledge 
the importance of healthcare to the transgender, 
non-binary and gender-fluid communities and 
that not all people who identify as women are 
born biologically female. The authors have 
often used the term “sex and gender” to reflect 
inclusive language and recognize the need for 

future research into health issues that is inclusive 
of the transgender, non-binary and gender-
fluid communities. They also acknowledge the 
profound differences for women based on factors 
such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, 
disability, age and sexual orientation. Additional 
work and research should reflect on how to tackle 
these barriers alongside the broader women’s 
health gap. In this report, the term “woman” may 
include those younger than age 18.

More than a third of 
the women’s health 
gap stems from 
nine conditions
Conditions affecting women impinge either 
on lifespan or day-to-day health over time, 
with nine selected conditions driving more 
than a third of the women’s health gap.

Analysis from the World Economic Forum (the 
Forum) and the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) has 
found that more than a third of the women’s health 
gap is created by the following nine conditions.

Selected conditions, in order of potential 
estimated gains in annual DALYs and GDP if the 
women’s health gap is closed by 2040:

Conditions that affect lifespan

Ischaemic heart disease

 – Cervical cancer

 – Breast cancer

 – Maternal hypertensive disorder

 – Post-partum haemorrhage

Conditions that affect health span

and LMIC burden (DALYs, GDP) and expert recommendations from Alliance members

Source: IHME, Global Burden of Disease (2019); DALYs (disability adjusted life years)

Six of the selected conditions are specific 
to women. Women are differently or 
disproportionately affected by the remaining 
three – ischaemic heart disease, migraine and 
breast cancer. Notably, how much any condition 
takes away from a woman’s quality of life – or 
contributes to the end of her life – can vary widely, 

particularly when considering factors such as 
race, ethnicity, income level or where she lives. 
Stakeholders may consider a condition’s impact 
on lifespan and health span when evaluating and 
prioritizing how to improve data on health burden, 
increase availability of effective treatments and 
reduce healthcare disparities.

10

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All1.1   Five conditions affect women’s lifespan

Five of the selected conditions contribute to 
mortality for women in all regions of the world: 
ischaemic heart disease, cervical cancer, breast 
cancer, maternal hypertensive disorders and post-
partum haemorrhage. 

Ischaemic heart disease is the leading cause of 
mortality for all women, crossing all geographies 
and ethnicities and resulting in the deaths of more 
than 4 million women per year.14 Despite a decline in 
overall deaths from ischaemic heart disease, women 
are more likely than men to die from an acute 
cardiovascular event.15 In the United States alone, 
closing the cardiovascular disease gap between 
men and women could let women regain at least 1.6 
million years of higher-quality life and add $28 billion 
to the country’s economy by 2040.16 Ischaemic 
heart disease represents potential estimated gains 
of 9.1 million annual DALYs and $43 billion in annual 
GDP in the women’s health gap.17 

Cervical cancer, while less common than breast 
cancer, leads to more than 350,000 deaths each 
year.18 The prevalence and deaths from cervical 
cancer are disproportionately high in lower-income 
countries: around 85% of cervical cancer deaths 
occur in low- and low-middle-income countries 
(LICs and LMICs).19 The highest rates of incidence 
and mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa, Central 
America and South-East Asia.20 In the US, cervical 
cancer causes two deaths per 100,000 women;21 
in Tanzania, cervical cancer causes 42 deaths per 
100,000 women.22 Globally, a 2022 analysis found 
that two in three women aged between 30 and 49 
had never been screened for cervical cancer; rates 
of cervical cancer screening ranged from 1% in 
Bangladesh to 73% in Brazil.23 Despite the existence 
of a vaccine that can prevent almost all types of 
cervical cancer, some estimates predict that cervical 
cancer could rise by almost 78% between 2018 and 
2030 (130,000 additional cases annually).24 Cervical 
cancer represents potential estimated gains of 2.4 
million annual DALYs and $10 billion in annual GDP 
in the women’s health gap.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer 
diagnosed in women, leading to the deaths of 
670,000 women globally every year.25 The number 
of newly diagnosed breast cancers is projected 
to grow by over 40%, leading to around 3 million 
annual new diagnoses by 2040.26 Education, early 
diagnosis and advanced treatments have reduced 
breast cancer mortality, alongside the availability 
of generic treatment options. A variety of efforts 
outside of care delivery – including grassroots 
advocacy – have led to monumental changes in 
funding and policy.27,28 Yet major disparities remain 

within and between countries: five-year breast 
cancer survival is more than 90% for women in 
high-income countries (HICs); in India, five-year 
survival is 66%; in South Africa it is 40%.29 In 
underserved populations within HICs, the five-
year survival for metastatic breast cancer is 30%, 
highlighting a need for better differentiation of the 
types of breast cancer, earlier access to stage-
appropriate treatment and health and social 
systems that enable treatment adherence.30,31 
Breast cancer represents potential estimated gains 
of 1.2 million annual DALYs and $8.7 billion in 
annual GDP in the women’s health gap.

Maternal hypertensive disorders, which are 
variations on high blood pressure, are leading 
causes of pregnancy-related complications 
and fatalities for mothers and infants.32 For 
example, pre-eclampsia – one type of maternal 
hypertensive disorder – accounts for 70,000 
maternal deaths worldwide each year.33 These 
“silent killers” may have few early symptoms and 
often go undiagnosed, particularly in women 
who lack access to adequate prenatal care.34 
In addition to putting a woman at greater risk of 
post-partum haemorrhage after birth, maternal 
hypertensive disorders are considered a risk factor 
for many conditions later in life such as chronic 
cardiovascular disease, stroke, atherosclerosis and 
chronic hypertension.35,36,37,38 Maternal hypertensive 
disorders represent potential estimated gains of 
0.85 million annual DALYs and $1.4 billion in annual 
GDP in the women’s health gap.

Post-partum haemorrhage is the leading cause 
of maternal mortality globally, accounting for 
around 20% of all maternal deaths:39 Annually, 
14 million women worldwide have a post-partum 
haemorrhage, leading to around 70,000 maternal 
deaths each year.40 A majority of women with 
post-partum haemorrhage are estimated to suffer 
from “near-miss” maternal mortality, leading to 
long-term complications,41 including brain disorders, 
chronic cardiovascular disease and other disabilities 
such as severe anaemia. Almost all post-partum 
haemorrhage deaths occur in LICs and lower-
middle-income countries (LMICs) and are largely 
preventable.42 Experts have cited barriers in LICs 
and LMICs that include poverty, a lack of transport/
poor road conditions, inadequate communication 
networks and a dearth of qualified health 
professionals.43 In HICs, post-partum haemorrhage 
is still among the leading causes of complications in 
pregnancy. Post-partum haemorrhage represents 
potential estimated gains of 0.25 million annual 
DALYs and approximately $200 million in annual 
GDP in the women’s health gap.

11

Migraine affects around 21% of women – 
approximately 0.8 billion women globally.52 While 
migraines affect both men and women, they are 
often reported to have a hormonal component, and 
women report longer attack duration, increased 
risk of headache recurrence, greater disability and 
longer time to recovery.53,54 Menstrual migraine, a 
type of migraine occurring within two days prior 
to and three days post onset of menstruation, 
is strongly linked to PMS, causing frequent and 
debilitating symptoms for many women.55 Women 
are 3.25 times more likely than men to experience 
migraines, but lack of research into understanding 
sex-specific differences and their clinical 
implications persists.56 Migraine represents potential 
estimated gains of 2.7 million annual DALYs and 
$80 billion in GDP in the women’s health gap. 

Endometriosis is an oestrogen-related condition 
affecting one in 10 women between the ages 
of 15 and 45 – more than 190 million women 
globally, though data gaps suggest this is a 
gross underestimate.57 Although textbooks 
have described endometriosis as a “disease 
of nulliparous women in their late twenties or 
thirties”,58 endometriosis is likely an adolescent-
onset disease. While the disease generally begins 
when a girl starts her period, it can take decades 
between onset and diagnosis.59,60 Endometriosis 
substantially affects all aspects of a woman’s quality 
of life. It can cause chronic pain and infertility and 
is associated with higher rates of depression.61 
As a result of its wide-ranging and debilitating 
symptoms, many women may miss work or reduce 
their working hours.62 Due to the prevalence, lack 
of treatments and unmet need, the Forum and MHI 
have estimated that the commercial market for 
potential endometriosis treatments ranges between 
$180 and $250 billion globally.63 Endometriosis 
represents potential estimated gains of 0.25 million 
annual DALYs and $12 billion in annual GDP in the 
women’s health gap.

Closing the women’s health gap – avoiding nearly 
27 million DALYs each year caused by these 
selected conditions and boosting the global 
economy – requires the drivers behind them to be 
understood, quantified and addressed as well as a 
transformation of health and social systems.

Menopause, PMS, migraine and endometriosis 
affect women’s day-to-day health over time, 
and are under-recognized, under-researched or 
misunderstood relative to the disability and difficulty 
they can cause. 

Menopause, an expected and normal transition 
for women in mid-life, is among the top conditions 
leading to profound impacts on health and quality 
of life for women. Perimenopause and menopause, 
which can last for more than a decade, are 
estimated to affect more than 450 million women 
worldwide at any one time.44 Long-term effects 
of menopause and untreated symptoms lead 
to increased risk of chronic conditions, such as 
cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases 
(e.g. depression, dementia), osteoporosis, type 
2 diabetes mellitus and other gynaecological 
conditions. Menopause represents potential 
estimated gains of 2.4 million annual DALYs 
and $120 billion in annual GDP in the women’s 
health gap. Based on high unmet need for proper 
diagnosis and treatment, the estimated global 
market potential for interventions that address 
menopause symptoms ranges from $120 billion to 
$350 billion globally.

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has the most 
wide-reaching effect on women’s health when 
considering the number of women it affects, the 
number of years a woman can have symptoms, 
how the symptoms can range in severity and 
how little is known or treated comparatively. 
Approximately 1.8 billion women menstruate each 
month,45 and 20–40% of women of reproductive 
age experience PMS.46 Caution is taken to not 
pathologize reproductive health, particularly for girls; 
and yet, given that societies and social systems 
were not designed to optimize the health of women 
and girls and schools and workplaces often do not 
adapt to the effects of menstrual cycles, the impact 
of PMS on education, employment and enjoyment 
of life can be significant. PMS symptoms are far-
reaching, ranging from weight gain, abdominal 
pain and back pain to anxiety and mood changes, 
with many of these being debilitating for women.47 
This can amount to an average of 23 days of lower 
productivity per year.48 Another recent analysis 
found that up to 31 million women and girls may 
have premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a more 
severe form of PMS.49 For school-aged girls, 
PMS and menstruation can lead to lower school 
attendance and lower educational attainment.50,51 
PMS represents potential estimated gains of 2.1 
million annual DALYs and $115 billion in annual 
GDP in the women’s health gap.

Quantifying the 
drivers: How to 
close the gap
The core elements of the women’s health 
gap indicate a need for better data, more 
effective interventions, improved care 
delivery, the inclusion of all women, and 
increased investment.

Taking the following steps in 2025 and beyond may 
help to close the women’s health gap:

Care for women

Count women

Improving the accuracy of data collection and 
standards could help clarify the true burden of 
disease, particularly for women-specific conditions 
and those that affect women differently or 
disproportionately. Further, accurately counting 
maternal health conditions is essential for 
understanding the implications for the long-term 
health of all women and children.

Study women

Research that includes and emphasizes women 
and their unique needs could help to dispel 
misperceptions and unknowns about conditions 
that affect women specifically, differently or 
disproportionately. Research could help to 
create a better understanding of conditions 
specific to women and illuminate disparities. 
Sex-disaggregated analysis of existing and future 
research could help reveal how women are 
affected by many conditions disproportionately or 
differently from men. Sex-disaggregated results 
enable an understanding of treatment efficacy and 
effectiveness. Additionally, studying the second 
X chromosome,64 hormonal health and hormonal 
cycles and the role they play in women’s health 
outcomes is needed. Research funding and a 
focus on women-specific conditions that affect 
adolescent girls is a large gap and opportunity. 

Delivering gender-appropriate and evidence- 
based healthcare, through healthcare delivery 
systems designed for women and equipped to 
address health-related social needs – including 
resources such as food, safe housing, childcare 
or transport – could improve health outcomes for 
women. The current healthcare delivery system 
often perpetuates preventable disability and 
mortality for women worldwide. There is a need 
for rapid translation of known evidence-based 
medicine into clinical education and CPGs that 
reflect sex-based differences. 

Include all women

No number of attempts to count, study, analyse 
or deliver better care to women will work without 
concentrated efforts to address racial, ethnic, 
geographical, socioeconomic and other disparities 
within countries and on a global scale. Stakeholders 
can consider how to acknowledge and address 
these differences and promote solutions that 
achieve health equity.

Invest in women

Additional funding – whether for clinical and 
translational research, public health education 
led by women in their communities or the 
development of innovative interventions – is 
needed to accelerate progress. Public and private 
investments in care delivery, education and social 
support services can prevent and treat disease and 
improve healthy longevity.

2.1   Count women

Improving data collection and standards could increase 
the understanding of women-specific needs.

Women’s health data is often not collected, not 
published in the public domain or incomplete, as 
highlighted in a Forum and MHI analysis of clinical 
trial results, CPGs and global datasets. When 
data does exist, such as data intended to track 
condition prevalence, reporting across different 
datasets is variable. For example, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 
10% of women of reproductive age are living with 
endometriosis, while the Global Burden of Disease 
estimates this figure to be 1–2%.65,66 That variation 
means between 24 million and 190 million women 
could have endometriosis, or even more when 
accounting for underdiagnosis.67 Data discrepancies 
lead to difficulty with estimating and describing the 
health of women across the selected conditions. 
These discrepancies are particularly evident in 
LICs and LMICs, where a lack of modern data 
infrastructures can lead to missed opportunities  
for data capture.68

Patient registries are critical elements of data 
collection, resource allocation and service planning. 
They collect data on symptoms, medication use, 
service usage, procedures and patient-reported 
outcomes. Health researchers and policy-makers 
can use this information to observe the course of 
the condition, understand variations in treatment 
outcomes and assess effectiveness across and 
within populations. The Forum and MHI analysis 
found that many countries lack condition-specific 
patient registries for the selected conditions.69 
Even when widely used and accepted registries 
exist, gaps persist: for example, international 
data collection standards are absent for many 
conditions.70 Population-level tracking of breast 

cancer stage and breast cancer recurrence is 
particularly poorly and inconsistently documented 
within the registries.71 

The ultimate outcome measure – death – is 
neither consistently nor accurately counted. 
No comprehensive source to track global 
mortality rates exists.72 Countries often self-
report into mortality databases, and data is often 
missing, particularly data from LICs and LMICs. 
Stakeholders could explore how to standardize, 
collect, report and update mortality data between 
and within countries to develop a comprehensive 
picture of disease burden, aid the allocation of 
resources and support healthcare systems to 
improve health outcomes. 

2.1.1 Lifespan data is poor; 
health span data availability  
and quality are worse

The Forum and MHI, in collaboration with the 
Global Alliance for Women’s Health working groups, 
developed proxy measures to uncover the scale 
of the data gap. These measures assessed global 
medication tracking of evidence-based treatments 
for the selected conditions. Inaccuracies – 
specifically, not knowing how, why or when women 
are either taking medications or missing opportunities 
to take medications – undermine a chance to inform 
investment in interventions or to improve care 
delivery. Lack of data can often impede monitoring 
and surveillance of medications and the effects   
on women.73 

14

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllNotably, no single database comprehensively 
tracks how medications are used and distributed 
or medication quality. This has implications for 
the supply chain and patient access. And while 
knowing if recommended medications are tracked 
in global pharmaceutical data is important, the 
sparsity of relevant and accurate data needed for 
the analysis is reflective of broader challenges with 
data collection, standardization and collaboration 
between stakeholders for conditions that contribute 
to the women’s health gap. 

2.1.2 Even if therapeutic 
products exist, knowing if 
they are accessible or used is 
impossible today

The Forum and MHI developed metrics to reveal 
whether medications for the selected conditions 
are tracked globally. Analyses were conducted 
to understand if and how comprehensively the 
medicines for the selected conditions are tracked in 
global pharmaceutical data.74

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllThe WHO publishes a Model List of Essential 
Medicines; if a medicine is on this list, the WHO 
considers treating the condition and accessing 
the associated therapeutics as essential for a 
country’s health system. CPGs are standardized 
recommendations that clinicians follow to diagnose 
and treat conditions. This analysis demonstrated 
the presence – and absence – of global 
pharmaceutical data across CPGs and essential 
medicines lists (EMLs) for the selected conditions 
and, subsequently, the lack of prioritization of 
treatments for women’s health conditions.

In carrying out this analysis, the Forum and MHI used 
comprehensive sources of global pharmaceutical 
volume data, knowing that no single-source 
database exists to provide details for all generic 
medicines, over-the-counter medicines and branded 
therapeutics. After consulting with experts in working 
groups, the IQVIA database was used for this analysis 
to provide the most complete picture. While this 
database is one of the most comprehensive sources 
of global pharmaceutical data, quality of medications, 
limited coverage of generics and lack of tracking of 
non-pharmaceutical interventions are caveats:

1.  Medication volume data is not indicative of the 

quality of medications, availability of medications 
or whether patients are able to access 
medications across countries.

2.  Limited data coverage for generic medications 
likely compounds the data gap from regions 
in which most medications used are generic, 
particularly for LICs and LMICs.

3.  Non-pharmaceutical interventions indicated 
in treatment guidelines are not tracked. Non-
pharmaceutical interventions include surgical 
procedures, which are particularly important 
to note for conditions such as endometriosis 
(for which laparoscopy is used for diagnosis 
and treatment) or breast cancer (for which 
mastectomies may be performed) or cervical 
cancer (for which loop electrosurgical  
excision procedure [LEEP]) therapy is a common 
treatment. Diagnostic tools are also not covered.

Overall, the Forum and MHI analysis found that 
medications recommended in CPGs are not 
comprehensively tracked in global pharmaceutical 
databases for 33% of the selected conditions – 
migraine, PMS and ischaemic heart disease.

The Model List of Essential Medicines includes 
medications for only six of the selected conditions 
(ischaemic heart disease, breast cancer, cervical 
cancer, migraine, maternal hypertensive disorders 
and post-partum haemorrhage). This implies that 
only 67% of the selected conditions are determined 
to have medicines that offer the greatest benefits to 
a population and should be available and affordable. 
Even for the selected conditions present in the Model 
List of Essential Medicines, the Forum and MHI 
analysis found that only one-third of the medicines 
included in the Model List are comprehensively 
tracked in global pharmaceutical data. 

Women-specific conditions that affect the health 
span – PMS, menopause and endometriosis – lack 
EMLs.75 This may reflect the lack of understanding 
of the burden of these conditions on women, 
families, communities and economies. As a result, 
the sense of how (and how well) women are 
managing pain is limited. In other words, for some 
of the most prevalent conditions in the world, the 
WHO does not recommend that countries include 
the treatments for these conditions as essential 
medicines, and tracking for the treatments that  
are being used (e.g. over-the-counter pain relievers) 
is limited. 

The Forum and MHI analysis found that 83% of 
medications referenced in menopause CPGs are 
tracked in the global pharmaceutical data, including 
oestrogen, progesterone and other hormonal 
treatments.76 While specific medications are tracked 
in global pharmaceutical data, limited data on 
compounded hormone therapies and tailored dosing 
of hormone therapies is collected. This potentially 
underestimates the treatments used and limits the 
understanding of the effectiveness and side effects 
for women using compounded and tailored therapies.

Additionally, the quality or availability of medications 
for women is not reflected in this analysis. 
Understanding whether providers and patients 
can obtain recommended medicines in different 
geographical areas – even for medications deemed 
“essential” – is challenging. Furthermore, the 
data does not reflect whether therapeutics are 
reimbursed by payers, either through national 
mandates or through individual payer formularies 
and coverage guidelines, highlighting additional 
questions regarding access.

16

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllIn contrast, on the upside, the Forum and MHI 
analysis found that all breast cancer pharmaceutical 
therapeutics recommended in global CPGs and 
the WHO’s Model List of Essential Medicines are 
tracked in global pharmaceutical data. Notably, 
the comprehensive set of interventions for breast 
cancer (e.g. radiotherapy, chemotherapy and 
surgical interventions) are not comprehensively 
measured across datasets. The breast cancer 
analysis demonstrates that collecting this type of 
data is possible and a potentially achievable goal for 
other conditions.

2.1.3 Publishing sex-disaggregated 
data could help the understanding 
of sex-related differences for 
conditions and their treatments

Women are not small men: sex-disaggregated 
data and analyses allow a better understanding 
of why and how interventions work differently in 

men and women, as well as the different effects 
of interventions attributed to sex and sex-specific 
physiology. The Forum and MHI analysis found that 
only around 10% of clinical trials for ischaemic heart 
disease and migraine published sex-disaggregated 
data.77 Limited understanding of how women 
and men may respond differently exacerbates the 
efficacy gap observed in most health interventions. 

Proportionate participation by women in clinical 
trials – relative to their share of the burden – and 
transparent sharing of sex-disaggregated trial 
outcomes, side effects and therapeutic dosage 
could allow scientists to evaluate the efficacy of a 
treatment.78,79,80 Additionally, none of the clinical trials 
for ischaemic heart disease and migraine accounted 
for hormonal fluctuations or menopause in women 
participants, which impedes the understanding of 
treatment effectiveness and how therapeutics differ 
throughout a woman’s life and hormonal stages.

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All2.1.4 A deeper look into heart 
disease and migraines

Ischaemic heart disease is the world’s number 
one cause of death for both men and women, 
responsible for the deaths of 9 million people 
annually (in 2019, roughly 4.97 million men and  
4.17 million women).81,82 

Analysing the results of clinical trials by sex could 
illuminate sex-specific differences, including different 
responses to treatment, different side effects 
and potentially different cardiovascular biological 
factors. However, Forum and MHI analysis showed 
only 17% of ischaemic heart disease clinical 
trials completed in 2022 and open to both sexes 
published sex-disaggregated results. 

Funding is needed, alongside regulatory reporting 
shifts, to publish sex-disaggregated data and 
analysis and encourage sex-specific research. 
The Forum and MHI analysis found that in the 
US, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for 
ischaemic heart disease increased overall between 
2020 and 2022, though the share of NIH research 
funding for women-specific ischaemic heart disease 
research decreased from 26% to 21%.83 

in 2022 published sex-disaggregated data.85 The 
Women’s Health Innovation Opportunity Map,86 
among others, has highlighted a need to research 
sex-related differences in the presentation and 
evolution of migraine given the sparsity of sex-
disaggregated research published.

Women who are pregnant and lactating are often 
excluded from clinical trials for migraine and other 
conditions. While testing new medications on 
pregnant women may not be advisable in many 
circumstances, a consequence of such research 
safety measures87 is a lack of understanding of 
how pregnant women may respond to migraine 
treatments. For example, a knowledge gap exists 
on how to manage migraines that get worse with 
pregnancy. Additionally, those with migraine in 
pregnancy have a higher risk of pre-eclampsia 
and maternal stroke.88 When pregnant women 
with migraine who developed pre-eclampsia in 
pregnancy were followed over time, they were 
discovered to have a higher risk of stroke later in 
life as well.89 The lack of knowledge and limited 
clinical trials around sex-specific research drives 
the treatment efficacy gap in migraines, particularly 
for women, throughout their entire lifetimes, and 
especially during stages of hormonal fluctuations, 
lactation and pregnancy. 

Migraine, which affects almost 21% of 
reproductive-age women, impedes productivity 
and quality of life for women around the world and 
accounts for a large portion of the women’s health 
gap.84 However, the Forum and MHI analysis found 
that only two trials out of the 52 (4%) completed 

Additionally, given the low participation of men in 
migraine clinical trials and limited sex-disaggregated 
results, both men and women suffering from 
migraines could benefit from sex-disaggregated 
data that can reflect treatment efficacy, 
effectiveness and side effects.

2.2   Study women

Conditions affecting women could benefit from 
more research funding and focus.

Research on the sex-distinctive elements of the 
selected conditions is needed.90 Lack of research 
limits knowledge about differences in outcome in 
diverse groups (critically, in women and girls) and 
impairs understanding of the selected conditions 
and their pathophysiology. 

Analysis of research funding can be used as a 
proxy for understanding the research topics being 
funded and the research priorities of funders. 
Global research funding is tracked in the NIH’s 
World RePORT database. This database covers 
both governmental and non-governmental funding 
bodies and may not include all funding from life 
sciences companies, private investors and local 
funders. Other analyses may be considered for 
tracking research attention and support, such 
as cumulative peer-reviewed publications about 
conditions; within this scope, global research 
funding was prioritized.

The Forum and MHI compared the value of global 
investment in research to the size of the global 
disease burden (measured in DALYs) for each 
of the selected conditions. The result is a metric 
that estimates the “dollars per DALY” of research 
funding allocated to the selected conditions. This 
metric reveals the extent to which research funding 
reflects the fair allocation of research resources 
– whether all DALYs were considered equally 
important. Additionally, disaggregating funding 
by type – such as basic science research, clinical 
trials, translational research and implementation 
science – helps to identify areas of greater 
investment need. For example, research on how 
treatment effectiveness changes within the context 
of a country or community, particularly in LICs and 
LMICs, is relatively underfunded.

18

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All2.2.1 Among the selected 
conditions, funding does not 
match disease burden 

What – and who – is studied and how investments 
are made illuminates research priorities and health 
equity concerns.

Women-specific conditions are relatively 
underfunded. PMS, menopause, maternal 
haemorrhage, maternal hypertensive disorders, 
cervical cancer and endometriosis comprise 14% 
of the total women’s health gap, as measured in 
DALYs. Collectively, the Forum and MHI analysis 

found that these conditions received less than 
1% of cumulative research funding in 2019–2023 
granted to all 64 conditions that drive most of the 
women’s health gap.91 Comparatively, diabetes 
makes up 2% of the women’s health gap, and 
received 12.5% of the research funding granted 
to all 64 conditions.92 The funding per DALY for 
diabetes is nearly double the funding per DALY 
of PMS, menopause, maternal haemorrhage, 
maternal hypertensive disorders, cervical cancer 
and endometriosis combined. While investments in 
diseases and conditions may not always mirror the 
pain and suffering those diseases and conditions 
cause, questioning the large gaps between funding 
and health burden is worthwhile.

Data retrieved June 2024 from World RePORT database

PMS is particularly underfunded. It accounts for 
4% of the women’s health gap, equating to 2.1 
million DALYs, yet research funding does not match 
the burden caused by PMS: almost zero dollars of 
research funding per DALY was allocated to PMS 
between 2019 and 202393 and only 16 clinical 
trials for PMS were registered between June 2023 
and June 2024. No funding or initiatives related 
to PMS were reported from 2019 to 2023 in the 
World RePORT database, and only a handful were 
related to premenstrual dysphoric disorder from 
2019 to 2023.94 Lack of research funding likely 
correlates with not having a clear understanding of 
what a “normal” period is, or how common irregular 

periods are for adolescents. One study measured 
the hormone levels of a large cohort of women 
throughout their menstrual cycles and found that 
not a single participant’s hormone levels matched 
“textbook” 28-day cycles.95 Another recent study 
examined variabilities in the menstrual cycle in 
demographic groups, age cohorts and based 
on BMI, with those who were Asian or Hispanic, 
older or having obesity experiencing more cycle 
variability.96,97 

Breast cancer receives the most funding of the 
selected conditions: cumulative global research 
funding for breast cancer is $393 per DALY. 

19

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllThe impact of that funding on improvements in 
breast cancer mortality over the past 30 years 
reflects the power of focus and investment. 
Research, education, activism and investment have 
led to huge gains overall – breast cancer mortality 
rates in the US, for example, decreased by 42% 
from 1989 to 2021.98 

Even for breast cancer, the need for research 
funding persists. The increasing breast cancer 
burden in LMICS and LICs requires a fresh look at 
where research is conducted, whether the research 
in different geographical areas is completely 
transferrable and the areas of research that 
receive funding.99 Disaggregated data by funding 
type – such as research funding for basic science 
versus implementation science – are not available 
in the database and not covered in this analysis. 
This data is important given that substantial work 
remains to understand effective ways to address 
socioeconomic and racial disparities, including in 
HICs: for example, Black women in the US are 40% 
more likely to die from breast cancer than white 
women, despite the presence of life-saving and life-
prolonging treatments in the country.100 

Across countries of all income levels, research 
is needed that provides greater insights into the 
genetic, biological, social and environmental 
factors of the selected conditions and helps 
with understanding different clinical outcomes. 
Enhanced research may translate into novel 
therapies, reduced disease burden and greater 
economic benefit for families, communities and 
countries.101,102 

2.2.2 More than three-quarters 
of clinical trials for the selected 
conditions are conducted in 
high-income countries

Clinical trials can assess the effectiveness of 
new interventions, different ways to use existing 
interventions or other variables that could affect 
health. Reviewing what, how and where trials are 
conducted illustrates one measure of industry and 
academic priorities. The analysis carried out by the 
Forum and MHI looks at active clinical trials with 
women enrollees registered with clinicaltrials.gov 
between 1 June 2023 and 31 May 2024.

Clinical trials for the selected conditions are not 
conducted in LICs and LMICs relative to the burden 
of those conditions in lower-income countries. The 
Forum and MHI analysis found that women and 
girls in LICs and LMICs experience 54% of the 
women’s health gap, yet 23% of clinical trials for 
the selected conditions focus on these regions. 
Upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) and 
HICs have 77% of clinical trials and only half of 
the global burden. While the evidence suggests 
that menopause symptoms may start earlier in 
women who live in LMICs,103 only 8% of the clinical 
trials identified for menopause are concentrated in 
LMICs. Similarly, 85% of cervical cancer cases arise 
in LICs or LMICs,104 yet only 9% of clinical trials for 
cervical cancer were conducted in these countries.

LICs and LMICs

UMICs and HICs

Treatment effectiveness in LICs and LMICs is 
difficult to understand when clinical trials are not 
conducted in those countries or communities. The 
Forum and MHI analysis did not identify any clinical 
trials in LICs for 67% of the selected conditions: 
migraine, menopause, PMS, endometriosis, 
breast cancer and ischaemic heart disease. The 
answer is not “more trials for trials’ sake”, but to 
evaluate whether clinical trials consider globally 
representative samples of the disease burden and 
whether or not their results can be extrapolated 
across populations and geographies.

Additionally, research and funding for a selected 
condition do not imply that unmet need no longer 
exists. Post-partum haemorrhage and maternal 
hypertensive disorders have the greatest proportion 
of trials in LMICs and LICs out of the selected 
conditions, yet significant morbidity and mortality 
from these conditions persist across these countries.

The first step in LMICs and LICs is more funding 
for wide-scale infrastructure, training, quality 
improvements and implementation that can enable 
successful clinical trials to take place. Investment in 
local primary investigator-led trials can improve local 
participation and ensure that the research questions 
and end points are aligned with local relevance and 
community needs.105

In HICs, the outsized proportion of funding and 
clinical trials may mask disparities and inequities 
within those countries. Publication and funding 
bias may affect the rate of trials completed in LICs 
and LMICs,106 but even when clinical trials are 
conducted in HICs, patient access to these trials 
and representation across minority racial and ethnic 
groups remains imbalanced107,108

21

Breast cancer has more registered clinical trials 
than all other female-specific selected conditions 
combined – 1,697 in total. In comparison, 44 trials 
for post-partum haemorrhage were registered. 
The prevalence of breast cancer is close to 500 
per 100,000 population, and the prevalence of 
post-partum haemorrhage is 320 per 100,000 
population.109 This highlights a one-third higher 
prevalence of breast cancer compared to post-
partum haemorrhage, and a near 40-fold difference 
in the number of trials for breast cancer compared 
to post-partum haemorrhage. 

In UMICs and HICs, ensuring diverse access 
to clinical trials – across race, ethnicities and 
geography – and decentralizing clinical trial 
enrolment may provide equitable access to 
innovative research while helping to make sure the 
results of clinical trials are more broadly applicable. 

Ensuring that innovative research and clinical trial 
enrolment reaches all women in all countries is 
dependent upon access to appropriate, high-quality 
care and care delivery systems. 

2.3   Care for women

More than a third of the women’s health gap 
stems from disparities in care delivery.

Even when evidence to support best practices 
exists, translating the findings from evidence-based 
research into clinical guidelines and subsequently 
adopting them into clinical practice is challenging.110 

CPGs are evidence-based, nationally recognized 
and standardized recommendations for healthcare 
professionals – doctors, nurses or other healthcare 
practitioners – on how to diagnose and treat 
specific medical conditions. Evaluation of CPGs 
can illuminate the clinical standard set by a country 
and reveal whether that standard is reflective of 
evidence-based practice. Examining CPGs for 
the selected conditions in 15 countries across all 
income levels helps to create a scalable blueprint 
for all countries and all conditions that drive the 
women’s health gap.

Evaluating a country’s CPGs for the selected 
conditions helps clarify whether evidence-
based, high-quality clinical guidelines are being 
recommended. Outdated, incomplete or missing 
guidelines can act as proxies to assess whether 
a country’s care delivery system is prioritizing the 
condition and spectrum of care associated with 
it. Yet this metric is only the first step: while CPGs 
are meant to reduce variability in care delivery, 
the implementation of guidelines may differ due 
to lack of resources or insufficient or different care 
delivery environments. In well-resourced countries, 
CPGs may not encourage the best interventions 
available, and instead aim for universally 
applicable recommendations (the lowest common 
denominator). When better technology and 
interventions are available (e.g. imaging technology), 
CPGs could encourage them and women could 
benefit from them.

2.3.1 Among selected conditions, 
less than 9% of CPGs in 
the studied countries met 
recommended global standards 

The Forum and MHI analysis found that none of the 
selected conditions had comprehensive or complete 
CPGs in all studied countries – and none of the 
studied countries had comprehensive or complete 
CPGs for all conditions. Practice-standard CPGs 
for women-specific conditions that affect health 
span were particularly sparse: in 25% of cases, 
there is either no CPG identified or no mention 
of any female-specific criteria across risk factors, 
diagnostic cut-off, treatment protocols or pathways.

CPGs for cervical cancer are present in all 15 of the 
studied countries, a feat not achieved by the other 
selected conditions. However, the country-level 
CPGs for cervical cancer were often incomplete 
– for example, specifics regarding vaccination 
targets, screening and time to treatment varied 
and were not always aligned with clinical evidence. 
Vaccination for human papilloma virus (HPV) almost 
entirely prevents cervical cancer, yet less than 25% 
of LICs have introduced HPV vaccination into their 
vaccine schedules and fewer than one in five girls 
around the world have been vaccinated for HPV.111 
Fewer than 5% of women in LICs and LMICs are 

screened for cervical cancer,112 reaching as low 
as 1% of women screened in parts of Africa.113 
Screening coverage in HICs is at least seven times 
higher than it is in LICs and LMICs.114 

CPGs for ischaemic heart disease met the standard 
for evidence-based recommended practice in 
only one of the studied countries, even though 
ischaemic heart disease is the leading cause 
of death for men and women worldwide. Few 
country-level CPGs for ischaemic heart disease 
acknowledge sex-based differences: 64% of CPGs 
for ischaemic heart disease mention women-
specific risk factors and risk scores (e.g. age, 
menopause and hormone replacement therapy 
[HRT]); 64% of CPGs for ischaemic heart disease 
mention that women may present differently from 
men with acute cardiac events (e.g. with dizziness, 
nausea and fatigue); 29% of CPGs for ischaemic 
heart disease acknowledge that women may 
respond differently from men to treatment or may 
require a different treatment pathway (for example, 
blood pressure optimization, given that standard 
dosing of some medications such as ACE inhibitors 
and beta blockers can lead to increased side 
effects in women and personalized adjustment 
of medication for women may need to account 
for physiological differences). Only the Brazilian 
guidelines mentioned evidence-based diagnostic 
cut-offs for women. One country lacked CPGs for 
ischaemic heart disease completely.

23

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All 
 
 
 
Providers caring for women with ischaemic heart 
disease often lack the education, guidance and 
support needed to deliver sex-specific clinical care,115 
and as a result, women are less likely to receive 
evidence-based recommendations and treatment for 
ischaemic heart disease when compared to men.116 
This is further exacerbated by disparities and inequities 
in care delivery, including quality and access.

CPGs for migraine lacked complete evidence-
based and practice standards in all of the 15 
studied countries. CPGs exist for 10 of the 15 
countries studied; of those, only seven country-
level CPGs included migraine treatment guidelines 
adapted for menstruation, pregnancy and lactation. 
An example that reinforces this is that only about a 
quarter of adults in the US with episodic migraine 
receive treatment.117 Even when medications 
are prescribed, clinical guidelines and healthcare 
payers often set a high bar for receiving them; 
patients often have to demonstrate failure to 
improve on multiple medications before access 
to third-line therapy is provided.118 For example, 
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-targeted 
medications are now considered an early option 
for migraine treatment,119 but less effective and 
less well-tolerated generic treatment options 
are often prescribed first, sometimes due to 
prior authorization guidelines from payers. Many 
women’s healthcare providers reported in 2020 that 
they were not aware of non-medication treatments 
with Level A evidence, including the effectiveness 
of biofeedback, cognitive behavioural therapy and 
lifestyle changes as treatments for migraines used 
in conjunction with medications.120 

For the conditions affecting health span – migraine, 
PMS, endometriosis and menopause – more than 
half of the studied countries were entirely missing 
CPGs describing either prevention, diagnosis 
or treatment of the condition. Of the selected 
conditions, menopause was one of the lowest-
performing in the CPG analysis, despite affecting 
most women globally at some point in their 
lifetimes. For PMS, a condition that affects 20–40% 
of women of reproductive age, 60% of the studied 
countries lacked CPGs entirely; of the countries 
with CPGs, most had comprehensive guidelines.

2.3.2 Global benchmarks may 
mask disparities within HICs 
while often creating less feasible 
expectations in LICs

Breast cancer and cervical cancer have higher CPG 
scores in most countries, although the high scores 
and the presence of CPGs across geographical 
areas and income levels may not equate to 
equitable implementation of the guidelines. 
Mammography, for example, is a globally 
recognized guideline for breast cancer screening 

included in most CPGs, although in HICs, access 
to screening can differ across race, ethnicity, 
socioeconomic class and geographical area. In 
LICs, access to mammography may be limited by 
the presence or lack of a mammography machine, 
reliability of electricity and availability of a workforce 
of technicians and radiologists (and surgeons and 
pathologists for women with a positive screen). 
Some LICs and LMICs highlight the challenges 
and feasibility of mammography within their 
CPGs. According to India’s CPGs, for instance, 
“population-wide mammographic screening […]  
of asymptomatic women is neither feasible [nor]  
as useful”.121

Additionally, CPGs may not reflect the evolution 
of clinical evidence that could help to address 
these inequities. In LMICs and LICs, educating 
women and the broader society on the signs and 
symptoms of breast cancer and when and how to 
seek care or support someone to seek care may 
promote early detection and intervention. In HICs, 
in which mammography has become routine, 
more precise approaches to screening, diagnosis 
and treatment may be beneficial, including earlier 
and easier access to stage-appropriate treatment 
and personalized, precision medicine.122 The 
sensitivity of mammography differs for women with 
dense breast tissue; both unnecessary biopsies 
and missed cancer can be risks when other 
technologies such as MRI are not made available or 
reimbursed.123 Implementation science and research 
and increasing awareness among communities can 
help reduce access and adherence challenges and 
demonstrate effective solutions. For example, using 
artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and connect with 
patients with gaps in care, communicating through 
text and phone calls in a patient’s primary language, 
identifying and addressing health-related social 
needs and enrolling women in rural areas or through 
primary care into decentralized clinical trials may 
help all women to find and adhere to the highest-
quality care.

2.3.3 Adoption and 
implementation of CPGs can vary 
within and between countries

CPGs may not be realistic in a country’s current 
reality.124 For example, the HPV vaccine needs 
continuous refrigeration, which may be difficult 
during a widescale power outage, or those with 
heart disease may benefit from visiting a cardiac 
rehabilitation centre but struggle with the accessible 
transport needed to get there. These cases 
reflect potential challenges in adopting CPGs for 
cervical cancer and for ischaemic heart disease, 
respectively.125 Given the limited pragmatic research 
into the implementation of practice standards within 
LICs, CPGs – often developed based on research 
in HICs – may feel unattainable for some providers 
and health systems, creating a sense of futility.

24

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllResearch on existing, locally relevant practices 
(i.e. “practice-based medicine”) may help to 
encourage clinically useful and achievable CPGs. 
In India, a randomized controlled trial in Mumbai 
demonstrated the effectiveness of education and 
clinical breast examinations to help achieve a 
lower stage at presentation (also known as “clinical 
downstaging”, indicating less extensive disease) 
in parallel with mammography.126 Standardized 
protocols and discharge checklists, for example, 
support better consistency and compliance with 
higher-quality care.127 More research is needed to 
develop CPGs that are effective within and across 
countries, recognizing both clinical evidence and 
local feasibility.

Even when resources do exist, such as in HICs, 
CPGs may not be adapted in day-to-day practice 
due to other barriers, such as lack of education 
and training, overstrained workforces, local 
access and resource challenges and structural 
discrimination according to race, gender, income 
levels or other factors. 

Implementation of CPGs and clinical education are 
intimately linked. Medical education and training for 
the selected conditions – particularly around sex-
specific differences across all selected conditions 
and diagnosis and treatment of conditions that 
affect health span – is limited, even for those in 
specialized programmes and in higher-income 
countries. For example, country-level CPGs for 
menopause and endometriosis are incomplete 
in the US. One US study found that only a third 
of obstetrics and gynaecology residency training 
programmes have a menopause curriculum, while 
another found that of almost 200 respondents, 
20% reported not having any menopause lectures 
during residency.128,129 Another study found that out 
of 67 residents in US obstetrics and gynaecology 
training programmes, most were comfortable 
diagnosing endometriosis but far less comfortable 
with treatment options or medical/surgical 
management.130

Education and training on clinical best practices 
improve care. For example, one training for 
residents paired a podcast series on menopause 
with an in-class discussion, resulting in an 18.3 
percentage point gain (60.8% to 79.1%) in 
answering knowledge-based questions correctly 
along with an increase in the residents’ self-ratings 
of knowledge, comfort and preparedness.131 

CPGs for the selected conditions, even when 
present, are often not translated into clinical care for 
girls. For example, many of the selected conditions 
may affect children and adolescents, yet paediatric 
training on conditions that affect girls differently 
and disproportionately is minimal. Women-specific 
conditions often present with menarche,132 and 
continue through adolescence as symptoms 
change and regulate. Lack of timely intervention 
may lead to longer-term consequences; for 
example, adhesions from endometriosis may lead 
to chronic pain and infertility. Paediatric history and 
physical exams often lack sexual and reproductive 
health; the lack of attention given to menstrual 
cycles and changes in sexual and reproductive 
health throughout adolescence are often not 
discussed in paediatrics appointments; and lack of 
focus in paediatric medical education and training 
on the selected conditions is a disservice to girls. 
For example, a 2020 survey of US paediatricians 
found that many reported not providing anticipatory 
guidance or discussing menstruation with patients, 
with male paediatricians significantly less likely to 
give patient education regarding menstruation or 
ask patients about their menstrual cycle.133 Among 
obstetrics and gynaecology trainees in Europe 
surveyed in 2021, more than 40% said that no 
paediatric and adolescent gynaecology training 
(rotations, electives or lectures) were offered in their 
curriculum.134 Ultimately, a lack of knowledge and 
training can mean missed diagnosis for health-span 
conditions, resulting in girls missing school, having 
associated mental health conditions, chronic pain 
and a sense of isolation. As puberty is starting 
earlier for girls,135,136 ensuring provider knowledge 
and training on adolescent gynaecological health  
is critical.

CPGs could be adaptable to populations and health 
systems while aligning with the latest evidence-
based medicine. They could lead to sex-specific 
education and training, across country income 
levels. They could be understood, recognized and 
implemented across specialties and age groups 
to ensure both women and girls receive evidence-
based care. CPGs, when fully representative 
of evidence-based practice and implemented 
appropriately, could result in multidisciplinary 
clinical management incentivized by adherence to 
guidelines, timely and coordinated diagnosis and 
treatment, the highest-quality care that is achievable 
for a woman in her community and pragmatic 
research into the effectiveness of CPGs and effect 
on clinical outcomes.

25

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All2.4   Include all women

All women should be included in efforts 
to improve care.

Based on recent Forum and MHI analyses and 
expertise from the Global Alliance for Women’s 
Health working groups, addressing inequity could 
have a greater impact on mortality for conditions 
affecting lifespan than any single treatment studied 
in recent clinical trials. 

No number of efforts to count, study, analyse 
or deliver better care for women will succeed 
without concentrated efforts to address structural 
inequities across race, ethnicities, geographical 
origin or residence and other disparities within 
and between countries. Among the conditions 
affecting lifespan – breast cancer, cervical cancer, 
ischaemic heart disease, post-partum haemorrhage 
and maternal hypertensive disorders – eliminating 
disparities associated with race, gender and 
geography could have a greater effect on mortality 
than the single treatments in completed and 
resulted Phase 3 clinical trials between 2021 and 
2023 for those conditions.137

By way of example, many of the recent treatment-
related clinical trials for breast and cervical cancer 
focus on halting the progression of metastatic 
disease. The reasons behind women’s mortality are 
often more complex than disease pathology alone, 
encompassing social determinants such as race, 
income and educational attainment. One 2017 
study found that when Black women died of breast 
cancer in the US, a lack of private insurance was 
connected to more than a third of the risk of these 
deaths, while tumour characteristics accounted 
for 23% of the risk.138 For cervical cancer, Black 
and Hispanic women in the US are more likely 
to experience delayed follow-up care after an 
abnormal pap smear, and Black women are 60% 
more likely than non-Hispanic white women to 
die of cervical cancer.139,140 In one assessment of 
Indonesian patients diagnosed with cervical cancer 
in 2022, almost 90% said they were unaware of 
cervical cancer prevention.141 

Despite a decline in overall deaths from ischaemic 
heart disease, women are more likely than men to 
die from an acute cardiovascular event142 and the 
overall mortality rate for women with ischaemic 
heart disease remains high.143 Complications are 
especially true for younger women: a study found 
that women between the ages of 18 and 55 with 
acute myocardial infarction experience more 
adverse outcomes than young men in the year after 
discharge compared to men.144 Within geographical 
regions, wide disparities exist: for example, the 
risk of dying from ischaemic heart disease varies 
across Europe, with lower mortality rates for 
women in Germany than Romania.145,146 In India, 
ischaemic heart disease rates are increasing faster 

in women than men, attributed to factors such as 
greater body weight, tobacco use, diabetes and 
periodontal infections, in addition to disparities in 
the delivery of healthcare by gender.147 

For maternal health, disparities are well known. 
Within HICs, Japan has 4 maternal deaths per 
100,000 live births; the United Kingdom has 
5.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births; the 
US has 22.3 maternal deaths per 100,000 live 
births.148 LICs, overall, have 430 maternal deaths 
per 100,000 live births.149 But the picture is more 
complex when looking deeper within a country. In 
the US, rates of post-partum haemorrhage rose 
by 26% between 1994 and 2006 and exacerbated 
disparities:150 Black women in the US are less 
likely to receive life-saving anti-haemorrhagic 
interventions than non-Black women.151 Black 
women in the US are 2.6 times more likely to die 
from pregnancy-related complications than non-
Hispanic white women, with 49.5 maternal deaths 
per 100,000 live births.152 

Health-related social needs limit access to 
healthcare delivery and are often a barrier to 
inclusion in research and clinical trials. Efforts to 
address health-related social needs and understand 
the implications of social determinants of health are 
critical to improving health span and lifespan. While 
social determinants of health are correlated with 
health outcomes, addressing health-related social 
needs can sometimes have an even greater impact 
on medical conditions than the care provided, due 
to their effects on delayed presentation, delayed 
diagnosis, access to interventions and trust in the 
healthcare system – as when health-related social 
needs are linked to delays in the diagnosis and 
treatment of cancer.153 When health-related social 
needs and mental health challenges are addressed, 
improvements in cancer care access and all-cause 
mortality are observed.154 Closing the women’s 
health gap will require provider education on the 
impact of social needs on clinical care and health 
outcomes, and training on screening for social 
needs and resources to support women with social 
needs and mitigate disparities.

Cultural barriers can lead many women, 
particularly those with lower levels of education 
and socioeconomic status, to avoid seeking 
healthcare. Feelings of shame and perceived stigma 
also affect care. In sub-Saharan Africa, “women 
reported fear of the cervical screening procedure 
and negative outcome, low level of awareness of 
services, embarrassment and possible violation 
of privacy, lack of spousal support, and societal 
stigmatization”, among other reasons for non-
participation.155 

26

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllAnother example is menopause, an expected 
transition for almost all women: globally, half of 
post-menopausal women believe that menopause 
is a taboo subject, and only 46% go to their doctors 
for symptom management while 28% have no plans 
to see their doctor.156 Similarly, menstruation is still 
perceived as a taboo subject by many, including 
women and girls, leading to meaningful levels of 
period poverty.157

Dignity and trust between women and their 
providers are the foundation of clinical relationships 
and successful health outcomes for women. 
Awareness and education can encourage 
individuals to advocate for and institutionalize sex- 
and gender-responsive care, and ensure providers 
deliver it.

2.5   Invest in women

Additional investments are needed to support 
the other actions.

The past year has seen substantial public and 
private commitments for investment in women’s 
health around the globe – but the work is only 
beginning.158,159,160,161,162 

Innovative investment and funding approaches 
across the public, private and social sectors have 
recently launched. For example, Pivotal Ventures 
released an open call for organizations around the 
world that advance women’s health and health 
equity, with $250 million in allocated funding for 
grants within a broader $1 billion commitment 
to advance the global power of women.163 The 
Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health 
(ARPA-H), a research funding agency of the US 
Government, opened a “Sprint for Women’s Health” 
to support health and biomedical breakthroughs. 
Within six months of the announcement, $113 
million was invested to support research on 
conditions that affect women differently or 
disproportionately, and 70% of the funded 
organizations are women-led.164

When investments are made, returns are 
achieved. For every £1 of public investment into 
obstetrics and gynaecology services per woman in 
England, there is an 11-fold return on the financial 
investment.165 

Research focused on the biology of health-span 
conditions requires more funding. For example, 
a 2024 study found that genetically-predicted 
levels of certain hormones were associated 
with endometriosis risk.166 While basic science 
investments may seem distant from treatment gaps 
and policy decisions, they are intertwined. When 
the diagnosis of health-span conditions is delayed, 

fewer women are counted as having the condition, 
which can lead to less investment in research. 
Scientists, life sciences companies and investors 
require adequate data on prevalence and potential 
market size to comfortably inform their investments.

Investment also means looking at who is leading the 
research and how a clinical research programme 
or clinical trial is run. One recent analysis found 
that when the principal investigators leading 
cardiovascular clinical trials were women, they 
were more likely to enrol women.167 Investment is 
needed in professorships, funded chairs and other 
dedicated research tracks for women’s health in 
academic institutions – beyond those in obstetrics 
and gynaecology departments – recognizing that 
more than half of the women’s health gap is tied 
to conditions that affect women differently or 
disproportionately from men. 

Investors, philanthropists and government funders 
can also consider a holistic and comprehensive 
approach to health beyond the healthcare delivery 
system. This includes social factors – such as 
nutrition, education, housing, water, clothing or 
transport – and how they influence outcomes. For 
example, UNICEF estimates that more than 400 
million children lack access to basic sanitation 
services at their school, and only about one in 
three schools offer bins for menstrual waste.168 
The connection between unmet social needs and 
health stretches into HICs – a McKinsey survey 
found that employed individuals in the US with 
one or more unmet basic social need were 2.4 
times more likely not to receive needed physical 
healthcare and to have missed six or more days of 
work in the past year.169

The path to progress
Collecting data is the first step in 
uncovering the drivers that will end the 
disparities and inequities in women’s 
health – but which data should be 
gathered and how best to use it? 

The selected conditions can prematurely end or 
meaningfully impair the health of women around 
the world. The societal and endemic factors 
contributing to the women’s health gap did not 
appear overnight, and solving each of the drivers in 
a vacuum will not close the gap.170 

Closing the women’s health gap – driven by the 
undercounting and under-reporting of women’s 

health data, the lack of understanding of the 
efficacy of interventions for women, inequities and 
disparities in the care delivery system and a lack 
of investment in the health of women – requires 
focused action, global commitments, local and 
international accountability and a fundamental 
transformation of health and social systems. 
Some actions for consideration are covered in the 
following sections.

28

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All3.1   Count women: Measure women’s health 

and health outcomes globally

Measuring and tracking components of the gap are 
important and meaningful first steps in the journey 
to equitable health and healthcare for women 
and girls. Measures that drive action and direct 
resources to areas of impact are critical.

The Women’s Health Impact Tracking (WHIT) 
platform was created to address this need. WHIT 
was designed to measure the burden of health 
conditions that contribute to the women’s health 
gap (in terms of disability, mortality and consequent 
economic effect) and country-level indicators 
of data availability, treatment effectiveness and 
quality and appropriateness of care delivery. It was 
designed by stakeholders, for stakeholders, as a 
practical and tactical tool to track progress over 
time and illuminate areas of opportunity to scale 
proven interventions to rapidly close the women’s 
health gap.

WHIT allows anyone around the world to view the 
2024 baseline, including the most recent data used 
for this report, with the potential to monitor year-on-
year progress and create a previously unavailable 
level of transparency. It incorporates metrics across 
the selected conditions developed in the Global 
Alliance for Women’s Health working groups and 
incorporates 15 countries that are representative of 
each income level.

WHIT is an initial step. It highlights important data 
gaps and creates a path to make relevant data 
available to stakeholders. Prior to the launch of 
the platform, researchers, policy-makers and 
business leaders gathered data on women’s health 

conditions and outcomes from fragmented sources 
– a process that was inefficient and fails to reveal 
the big picture. With WHIT, leaders and interested 
parties can access centralized, tested data. This 
allows leaders to spend their time and efforts not on 
collecting data, but on understanding and using it. 
Additionally, WHIT was built for scale. Over time, it 
aims to expand to all countries and conditions that 
contribute to most of the women’s health gap.

But data is useful only if used effectively, and 
no one stakeholder can reverse structural 
inequalities and inequities. Every life matters – 
and so does every death. One meaningful goal 
could be for all countries to standardize data 
collection for maternal mortality, pregnancy-related 
complications and additional conditions affecting 
the maternal health span. Additionally, healthy 
births could be measured.

Pregnancy is the “canary in the coal mine”:171 for an 
individual woman, complications in pregnancy can 
illuminate potential long-term health consequences; 
for a society, how pregnant women are cared for 
(or not) is indicative of investment and priorities in 
health and social systems. For example, women 
with gestational diabetes are more likely to develop 
diabetes mellitus, type 2, later in life; women with 
cardiac-related conditions in pregnancy may 
have vascular changes that persist after delivery  
and greater risk of ischaemic heart disease. By 
standardizing the collection of health metrics for 
pregnant women, healthcare professionals can have 
broader insights into the health of individual women 
and of populations in the longer term.

3.2   Study women: Understand hormonal health 

and women’s biology

Better understanding of hormones and the biology 
of sex-related differences may improve women’s 
lifespan and health span. 

Researchers have found links between oestrogen, 
menopause and brain health. One study found 
that a decline in oestradiol during the menopause 
transition was associated with changes in the brain, 
including cognitive changes, effects on sleep and 
effects on mood.173 Another analysis of close to  
200 women between the ages of 40 and 65 found 
that menopause tended to affect brain structure, 
connectivity, energy metabolism and amyloid-  
beta deposition.174 

Research into sex-specific biology across basic 
science, pathophysiology and clinical trials could 
include the implications of hormones on medication 
metabolism and effectiveness – including a more 
personalized approach to hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT) to drive better health outcomes.

For instance, a recent study evaluated oestrogen 
receptor activity across the brain for pre-, peri- and 
post-menopausal women. Oestrogen receptor 
density (a measurement of an organ’s “hunger” 
for oestrogen) progressively increased in the brain 
over the menopause transition, and increased 
oestrogen receptor density in areas of cognition was 
associated with lower memory scores for women. 

29

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllMost striking was that, based on PET imaging,  
the brains of post-menopausal women far past  
the menopause transition were still “hungry”  
for oestrogen.175 

Basic science research on hormones, such as 
this study of oestrogen receptors in the brain, 
has implications for care delivery and healthcare 
payment. For example, most CPGs recommend the 

initiation of HRT around the menopause transition, 
and oestrogen therapy is often reimbursed by health 
insurance companies only when started in this 
time frame. Yet this research suggests that older 
women may also benefit from initiation of oestrogen 
replacement therapy. In other words, near-term 
research results may highlight opportunities for 
near-term impact in the lives of women.

3.3   Care for women: Implement CPGs for 

women-specific conditions and account for 
sex-specific differences within CPGs

CPGs offer standardized recommendations for 
healthcare professionals and could be enhanced 
to reflect women-specific evidence, particularly 
for women-specific conditions that affect health 
span. Having CPGs for women-specific conditions 
such as endometriosis and menopause and 
accounting for sex-specific differences in the CPGs 
for conditions that affect both men and women, 
such as ischaemic heart disease, are essential 
actions and not currently achieved across all of the 
studied countries or selected conditions. The time 
is now for healthcare providers to have access to 
comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines and the 
education, training and necessary infrastructure to 
implement them in practice.

the highest-quality care is delivered within and 
between countries, particularly those with fewer 
care delivery resources, and then incorporated 
into country-level CPGs when appropriate. The 
studied countries may have locally relevant clinical 
approaches that are effective within the reality of 
their communities and care systems, such as India’s 
emphasis on education and clinical breast exams 
as a breast cancer screening tool, that could benefit 
from structured research. Overall, though, lower 
incomes, race and ethnicity, geography or other 
factors should not determine a woman’s fate when 
it comes to her health – including and perhaps 
especially in countries with the resources to prevent 
disparities and inequities.

CPGs based on research conducted in HICs 
sometimes clash with the reality of care delivery 
in LICs and LMICs. Even within UMICs and HICs, 
the actuality of care delivery – including resources, 
access and health-related social needs – may 
impair delivery of evidence-based clinical care. 
CPGs could help to account for local realities 
while also ensuring the best evidence-based 
care available in a geographical area. More 
research is needed to understand how to ensure 

As the use of AI/machine learning continues to 
evolve, countries may also consider AI-enabled 
functions to ensure timely updates to CPGs. 
A challenge could be to make sure inputs into 
the language learning model reflect sex-specific 
differences and data and considerations specific to 
a country and its delivery system. Without this, AI 
could further perpetuate inequities and disparities in 
care delivery for women.

30

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All 
3.4   Include all women: Develop accessible 

solutions to enable early intervention and 
treatment for women around the world

Women in all countries could benefit from 
infrastructure, trained healthcare workforces  
and innovations that prioritize lifespan and health-
span conditions. 

These solutions can be high-quality and cost 
effective. One recent study of 78 hospitals in Kenya, 
South Africa, Nigeria and Tanzania found that 
providing calibrated blood-collection drapes and 
using bundled first-response treatment in hospitals 
helped diagnose post-partum haemorrhage earlier 
while also using resources more effectively.176 

Low-dose aspirin is known to reduce the risk of 
maternal hypertensive disorders. One study found 
that women in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Pakistan and 
Zambia with a singleton pregnancy who received 
low-dose aspirin were 11% less likely to deliver 
before 37 weeks. Similarly, the risk of early pre-term 
birth was lowered by 25% and perinatal mortality 
was decreased by 16%.177 More research is needed 
in LICs and LMICs to evaluate and overcome the 
barriers to women taking aspirin when indicated.

Digital health can also be an impactful catalyst. A 
programme in Tanzania and Lesotho, m-mama, 
connects women to community drivers and local 
ambulances via a technology platform to provide 
emergency transport for women in pregnancy and 
labour. m-mama provides a toll-free phone number 
and connects callers to a government-owned 
and operated dispatch service, which triages 
the woman’s condition and deploys transport 

nationwide to the nearest and most appropriate 
facility identified by the platform. The programme 
provides approximately 50,000 rides annually and 
is set to launch in Kenya in 2025. m-mama found 
that maternal mortality reduced by 27% and infant 
mortality reduced by 40% in its pilot regions.178 

However, even as digital health solutions become 
more accessible, stakeholders may consider how 
all countries – including HICs – are assessing 
their use across populations. A World Health 
Organization European Scoping Review found that 
the women studied were among those less likely 
to have access to digital technology or motivation 
to engage with digital platforms and that they are 
among the groups more likely to lack knowledge, 
skills and confidence in using digital technology.179 
Other studies of pregnant women in Europe have 
found that factors such as less education, lower 
income or not speaking the native language can 
make digital tools less effective.180,181 However, 
an analysis of midwives largely across HICs 
found that many were positive about sending 
customizable SMS (text messages) and offering 
remote monitoring during pregnancy, noting that it 
complimented their work in high-risk pregnancies.182 

Accessible and affordable interventions can prevent 
DALYs and save women’s lives during pregnancy 
and delivery. Investment and research in care 
delivery innovation in LICs and LMICs could yield 
creative solutions for some of the biggest health 
challenges women and their children face.

31

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All 
3.5   Invest in women: Investors, businesses, 

governments, philanthropies and universities 
have a key role to play

Monumental investment in women, their health and 
their healthcare is needed to close the women’s 
health gap. 

Earlier in this report, actions that policy-makers, 
health and social systems, life sciences and 
investors can take to close the women’s health gap 
were highlighted. 

Additionally, given that most of the time women 
spend in poor health occurs during their working 
years, employers can play a meaningful role in 
advancing women’s health. And employers benefit 
when they invest in women. For example, investing 
in menstrual health in the workplace has been 
shown to reduce absenteeism by 62% and to 
reduce workforce turnover by 23%.183 Employers 
can create a culture of flexibility and caring in which 
the health of women is valued and emphasized. 
Employers often control an employee’s physical 
working environment and can design workplaces to 
support women and their health. This could include 
private lactation rooms for nursing mothers, electric 
fans for women in menopause, having safe places 
to change menstrual pads, or making sure that sites 
requiring personal protective equipment have sizes 
for women. Employees are increasingly demanding 
and valuing more flexibility in their benefits, 
spanning from increased family-forming support to 
access to sex- and gender-specific care. 

Women who are at leadership tables may be 
better able to help drive strategic investments and 
actions to close the women’s health gap. As the 
Forum’s Global Gender Gap 2024 and McKinsey’s 
Women in the Workplace 2024, in partnership with 
Leanin.org, reports have noted, women struggle 
in the career path from entry level roles to C-suite 

positions. The Forum notes that while women 
occupy around half of entry-level positions, they 
represent a quarter of C-suite roles.184,185 Research 
is needed to understand the correlation between 
conditions driving the women’s health gap and 
the “broken rung” of the leadership ladder. Fixing 
the ladder is important to the health and work life 
of women and to the organizations for which they 
work: firms with women in senior positions are more 
profitable and socially responsible, according to the 
Harvard Business Review.186 McKinsey research 
also found that new businesses led by a woman 
or member of an under-represented group in 2023 
were more likely to succeed.187 Women Count 
2022 also found that companies in the United 
Kingdom whose executive committee membership 
was at least 50% women had the highest profit 
margin, and companies with between 25% and 
49% women on their executive committees had the 
second-highest profit margin.188

Business leaders and investors may also consider 
how the next generation is learning – or not – about 
women’s health conditions. Weaving in elements of 
health literacy – whether it’s explaining how heart 
attack symptoms can look different or explaining 
what a cervix is – to boys and girls at an earlier 
age can be empowering for all students. Recent 
studies on menstruation have found that involving 
boys in menstrual education, for example, can help 
decrease teasing or embarrassment in schools and 
help them act as advocates for girls.189,190 

Achieving the economic benefits of closing 
the women’s health gap requires coordinated, 
collaborative and transformative investment 
between public, private and social sectors.

32

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for AllConclusion
Public-, private- and social-sector 
stakeholders can drive change in a world 
in which the women’s health gap is 
impeding productivity and holding women 
back from leading full and healthy lives.

Global health and social systems were not designed 
around the health of women. Women across 
the world are diagnosed with and often die from 
conditions that are preventable and treatable. They 
regularly experience a disability burden from the 
selected conditions, affecting lives and families, 
communities, workplaces and economies. They 
face barriers to accessing healthcare, are often 
seen by providers with a limited understanding of 
women’s holistic health and healthcare, and face 
the risk of premature death and avoidable disability.

The challenges of knowing the true prevalence 
of women’s health conditions, the limited 
understanding of the efficacy of sex-specific 
interventions, the difficulties of delivering evidence-
based and equitable healthcare and the limited 
historical investment in the health of women – all 
widen the women’s health gap and exacerbate 
morbidity and mortality from the selected conditions. 

The Women’s Health Impact Tracker is one step 
towards improving the lives of women today 
and for future generations. Public-, private- and 
social-sector stakeholders are beginning to 
recognize how tackling the selected conditions 
and closing the women’s health gap benefits 
families, communities and economies. But closing 
the gap requires collaboration, investment and 
a commitment to transforming health and social 
systems for the betterment of society. The 
concepts outlined in this report – counting women, 
studying women, caring for women, including 
all women and investing in women – offer a 
framework for how to move forward.

Progress is possible, and closing the women’s 
health gap is achievable. Now is the time for action 
that will improve the lives of women and girls 
around the world and enable stronger economies.

Introduction

This report and the accompanying Women’s Health 
Impact Tracking (WHIT) Platform provide data-
driven insights that track progress to close the 
women’s health gap, in terms of gaps across care 
delivery, treatment efficacy and data availability.

In the 2024 report, Closing the Women’s Health 
Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and 
Economies, 64 conditions were identified that affect 
women uniquely, differently or disproportionately 
to men and account for almost 86% of the global 
disease burden among women. To effectively 
address the gaps in care delivery, treatment 
efficacy, data availability and investment across 

these conditions, a phased approach was adopted. 
In the first year, nine conditions were selected using 
a framework that assessed their potential impact on 
women’s lives and their broader economic impact, 
among other criteria. Process and outcome data 
for each condition was collected at a global level, 
and when data was unavailable, country-level data 
was tracked in 15 selected countries and impact-
tracking metrics were subsequently defined.

This appendix provides the detailed methodologies, 
frameworks and data sources underpinning these 
efforts, ensuring transparency and enabling future 
application of the insights presented.

1

Selection of high-
impact conditions 
selected for year 1, 
countries and metrics

1.1   Selected conditions

A selection framework identified nine women’s 
health conditions that, collectively, account for one-
third of the overall women’s health gap and are the 
focus of the first edition of the WHIT platform. The 
following criteria guided the selection: 

 – Global burden of disease measured in disability-

adjusted life years (DALYs)

 – Economic impact measured in terms of potential 
change in GDP (estimated by the supply-side 
benefits from having a larger, healthier and 
more productive female labour force, which 
were used to project the annual potential GDP 
contribution to 2040)191

 – Prevalence rate measured in rate per 100,000 

population

 –

Incidence rate measured in rate per 100,000 
population

 – Burden and GDP impact in lower-middle-

income countries (LMICs) and low-income 
countries (LICs)

 – Global Alliance for Women’s Health members’ 

expert recommendations 

Each criterion was given a different weighting 
depending on the potential to build a compelling 
investment case for addressing women’s health 
disparities: global burden, GDP impact, Alliance 
members’ expert recommendations all scored a 1 
on relative relevance; prevalence rate and incidence 
rate scored a 2; and then LMIC and LIC burden 
and GDP impact scored a 3. For each criterion, 
conditions were ranked from lowest to highest 
across the 64 conditions, and each rank was 
multiplied by the allocated weight for the criteria. 
These seven criteria formed a composite score 
to rank the conditions as follows. Please refer to 
Figure 1 in the report for details.

This report uses global data when available; when 
not possible, the analyses used data specific to  
15 countries selected for more detailed examination. 
While measuring the contributors to the women’s 
health gap is complex, this approach aims to use 
metrics that can track directional progress using a 
combination of quantitative and qualitative measures.

For the first year, 15 countries were selected across 
four income archetypes based on World Bank (2019) 
data.192 The selection framework focused on diverse 
healthcare systems and socioeconomic conditions. 
Three to four countries per income archetype were 
included, based on the largest gap size (in terms of 
DALY) and opportunity for improvement. In addition 
to diversity across income archetypes and DALYs, 
countries were selected based on adequate data 
feasibility and Alliance priorities.

1.3   Selection of metrics

A set of seven metrics spanning the treatment 
efficacy gap, care delivery gap and data gap were 
identified, applicable to all nine prioritized women’s 
health conditions and for which data were available. 

These are accompanied by condition-specific 
metrics, where more detailed examinations are 
taken for metrics that directly correlate to closing of 
the women’s health gap for these conditions.

2.1   Data-gap metrics

2.1.1 Metric 1:  
Medication volume tracking

Definition: Medication use coverage in volume data 
as compared to clinical practice guidelines (brief)

Source: World Health Organization WHO Model 
Lists of Essential Medicines (EMLs), clinical practice 
guidelines (CPGs – see Metric 2.2.1), IQVIA 

Period: Most recent year available 

The first metric chosen for analysis reveals whether 
pharmaceutical treatments used for a condition (as 
outlined in CPGs and/or WHO EMLs) are reported 
and tracked. Across this metric, an array of data 
sources has been analysed, including CPGs, 
the WHO EMLs (both their presence and their 
comprehensiveness) and the volume of medications 
sold by condition. By gathering this data for 
whether treatments are used for a condition, the 
availability and accuracy of data and collaboration 
are reflected, with a call to action for stakeholders to 
fill these data gaps. It is important to note that this 
metric is not meant to capture disease management 
and is indicative only of data availability. Further, 
the data does not capture non-pharmaceutical 
interventions or direct measures of patient access 
to medication as highlighted in the report. 

follow in Metric 2) and WHO EMLs (where data 
was present) of the prioritized conditions were then 
analysed in comparison. 

To conduct this analysis, an exhaustive list of 
therapeutics covered in global CPGs and the 
WHO EMLs (where present) was generated 
for each condition. Given the differences in 
medications listed in CPGs compared to EMLs, two 
approaches were taken to conduct the analysis. 
For EMLs, individual medications were listed, 
and medications included in volume data were 
compared against the names of medications. For 
CPGs, often classes of medications are listed, 
in the expectation that healthcare practitioners 
prescribe a class of medication to patients rather 
than acting on prescriptive directions on the name 
or brand of medication that should be available. 
Given this, and the data limitations available, the 
identified therapeutics were grouped into relevant 
buckets from the CPGs. These buckets were then 
compared to therapeutic buckets across the latest 
full-year volume data (current data uses 2023 latest 
figures) with each bucket being scored if it were 
present in the data. Exhaustivity of buckets across 
CPGs and WHO EMLs were calculated and scored 
per condition. Scores were allocated based on % 
exhaustivity: <50% exhaustivity received a score of 
1, 50–75% exhaustivity received a score of 2 and 
>75% exhaustivity received a score of 3.

To understand the comprehensiveness of tracking, 
global volume data for therapeutics was compared 
to CPGs and/or WHO EMLs where available. Global 
volume data for therapeutics is collated and tracked 
globally through reporting from pharmaceutical 
companies and via data provided by healthcare 
practitioners on the volume of medication they 
prescribe by condition globally. Therapeutics 
recommended in the latest CPGs (further details 

This metric demonstrates the presence (and 
absence) of data dependent upon multiple 
stakeholders. While the metric itself is important 
– i.e. knowing if medications recommended in 
evidence-based practice are tracked – the gaps in 
and sparsity of data reflect broader challenges with 
data collection, standardization and collaboration 
for conditions that contribute to the women’s  
health gap.

2.2   Care delivery gap metrics

2.2.1 Metric 2:  
Clinical practice guidelines

Definition: Assessment of how closely national 
CPGs follow global benchmarks

Source: WHO guidelines, International Federation 
of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) guidelines, 
country-level clinical practice guidelines

Period: Most recent year available 

CPGs are evidence-based, nationally recognized, 
standardized recommendations for healthcare 
professionals (doctors, nurses and other healthcare 
practitioners) on how to diagnose and treat specific 
medical conditions, and are foundational steps 
towards providing quality care. While designed to 
reduce variability of care provided and improve 
health outcomes, implementation challenges often 
arise given disparities in access to resources, 
knowledge or care-delivery environments that can 
meet these standards. 

Outdated, incomplete or missing guidelines are 
proxies for a care delivery system that does not or 
is unable to prioritize the condition and spectrum 
of care associated with it. The presence and 
comprehensiveness of CPGs for the nine conditions 
in 15 countries were included in this analysis. 

To conduct this assessment, a global benchmark 
was determined based on guidelines published by 
the WHO, FIGO or equivalent body for all conditions. 
The comprehensiveness of national CPGs (when 
available) from the 15 selected countries across the 
nine conditions was then assessed by comparing 
to the global benchmark. Then, each CPG was 
scored 1–3 for prevention (if applicable), diagnosis 
and treatment to identify gaps and opportunities for 
further development. These 1–3 assessment levels 
were based on the inclusion of risk factors specific 
to women, diagnostic cut-off, treatment protocols 
and pathways. A score of 1 indicates the guideline 
fell below the standard of the global guideline, 
a 2 indicates there are some gaps to achieving 
the global guideline standard and 3 indicates the 
guideline is in line with global guidelines.

CPGs were not always straightforward to identify, 
and in some cases individual requests had to be 
made to multiple stakeholders in different working 
groups to identify what was seen as a best-practice 
CPG for prevention, diagnosis or treatment of a 
condition. Some element of standardization and 
minimum requirement of quality in CPGs – for 
instance, benchmarked against global CPGs as 
attempted in this assessment – may have a positive 
effect on care delivery through more thorough and 
easily accessible guidance.

In the analysis itself, some allowances could 
be made in which CPGs for related or similar 
conditions might exist and could cover care 
guidance – for instance, antenatal care covering 
some of the elements assessed in maternal 
health-related conditions. However, this report 
maintains that a lack of clear guidance specifically 
for a condition is a gap that could be addressed 
to ensure comprehensive direction is available to 
support a minimum standard of care. 

To ensure the assessment was globally applicable, 
the best-standard CPGs were applied as the 
benchmark against which to compare. However, 
there are some instances, particularly in LMICs, in 
which these CPGs may not be feasible or appropriate 
to implement. For example, mammographic 
screening is challenging to implement and not yet 
scaled in some LMIC countries; however, it is often 
included in the CPG benchmark as the best practice. 

CPGs are also updated at countries’ discretion and 
therefore some may be older than others, potentially 
creating inequities between the assessments. 
However, having an outdated CPG in itself is an 
aspect of the care delivery gap that countries could 
be encouraged to address. This analysis used the 
latest CPGs available at the country level to carry 
out the analysis, recognizing that the latest year of 
update may vary across conditions and countries.

2.2.2 Metric 3:  
Mortality rate

Definition: Mortality rate by condition

Source: WHO mortality database, Global Cancer 
Observatory database

Period: 2001–2023 

Mortality measures the frequency of condition-
specific deaths within a population. Mortality due to 
the women’s health conditions included in the first 
year of tracking may be preventable with existing 
treatments and is often connected to disparities 
in care. Data was collected only for conditions 
where applicable, with not all conditions having 
mortality as a likely and direct outcome. Conditions 
included are ischaemic heart disease, post-partum 
haemorrhage, breast cancer and cervical cancer. 

Data from the WHO mortality and Global Cancer 
Observatory databases were collected in August 
2024. The WHO mortality database was used to 
track mortality for ischaemic heart disease and 
post-partum haemorrhage, whereas the Global 
Cancer Observatory database was used to collect 
data on breast and cervical cancer.

40

Blueprint to Close the Women’s Health Gap: How to Improve Lives and Economies for All 
 
 
 
Both the WHO mortality database and the Global 
Cancer Observatory database were selected for 
analysis due to the relative comprehensiveness 
of data they provide for conditions. The Global 
Cancer Observatory registry collects the most 
comprehensive cancer data, while the WHO 
mortality database covers other conditions 
completely. However, it is important to note 
challenges in both. The WHO mortality database 
has limited LMIC and LIC data, providing an 
incomplete view of the global condition-related 
mortality. On the contrary, the Global Cancer 
Observatory database does not capture historical 
data, indicating a limited view of how mortality 
related to cancer has changed over time. 

It is also important to note the differences in 
methodology between databases. The WHO 
mortality dashboard relies on data provided by 
civil registries submitted by countries, without 
adjustments for completeness. In 2001, the 
WHO developed the new (WHO World Standard) 
standard population, considering a revised reflection 
of the world population today. It is important to note 
the use of different methodologies for standardizing 
populations in the age-standardized mortality rates 
across the WHO dashboard and the global CAN 
database. These methodologies were retained by 
the authors, and were used as comparatives when 
understanding mortality for different conditions.

2.3   Efficacy gap metrics

2.3.1 Metric 4:  
Research funds

Definition: Comparison of research funding amount 
relative to burden for conditions

Source: World RePORT database, Institute for 
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)

Period: 2019–2023 

A metric to track research funding in relation to the 
disability burden is “dollar per DALY”: the ratio of 
total global research dollars allocated to a specific 
condition and the number of DALYs attributed to 
that condition worldwide. This metric may have 
implications for efficacy. Funding attributed to 
conditions can support increased investment in new 
therapies, studying the effectiveness of therapies 
and evidence on their adoption in different care 
settings. It also demonstrates funding priorities 
over time, and how conditions with significant 
burdens are supported. This analysis compared 
the cumulative funding from 2019 to 2023 (the past 
five years) related to a condition, compared to the 
condition’s burden, measured in DALYs. This may 
help reach an understanding of how funding and 
resource allocation is distributed globally, compared 
to the burden a disease carries for populations, and 
allow a comparison between conditions.

Data captured for funding relating to conditions 
is derived from the World RePORT database, a 
global database tracking research initiatives and 
funding from national and international institutions 
over the past eight years. While a comprehensive 
number of institutions are tracked in the database, 

the database does not capture every grant and 
funding allocation for conditions. Further, many of 
the institutions are based in high-income regions. 
Although funding from these institutions can be 
allocated to other regions outside of high-income 
countries (HICs), it is possible that funding in other 
regions is less comprehensively accounted for given 
research institution priorities, and the presence of 
local funders who are not included in this database.

Additionally, to assess funding by condition, 
initiatives were searched for on the World RePORT 
database in June 2024. Initiatives were identified 
based on the inclusion of the condition in the 
initiative abstract or title. This means that for some 
initiatives allocated across multiple conditions, 
initiatives and the funding for these initiatives are 
counted in more than one condition. An example is 
maternal health conditions, for which initiatives may 
be allocated across maternal hypertension, post-
partum haemorrhage, maternal sepsis and other 
specific maternal health disorders. 

While this leads to double counting in some cases, 
the inclusion of conditions in the abstract or title of 
the initiative is still important to reflect when tracking 
the closing of the gap. By mentioning the condition 
somewhere in the research, awareness is further 
drawn to that condition. This is particularly relevant 
for women’s health conditions, for which stigma is 
often high and understanding of the disease can 
be low. Allocating increased funding for women’s 
health conditions, whether initiatives focused 
specifically on the biological manifestation of the 
disease or those targeting populations with the 
disease, could contribute to the closing of the gap 
by increasing awareness and understanding.

2.3.2 Metric 5:  
Assets in the pipeline

Definition: Assessment of innovative assets relative 
to burden for conditions

Source: Pharmaprojects, IHME

Period: April 2023–June 2024 

Assets in the pipeline for women’s health 
conditions – pharmaceutical assets in clinical trials 
in progress from preclinical to Phase 3 – can be 
an indicator of where pharmaceutical companies 
and researchers are focusing efforts for treatments 
and medical interventions. These assets were 
assessed by the McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) 
team in collaboration with the Forum to understand 
the level of innovation and readiness to market for 
pharmaceutical interventions. 

To capture year-on-year impact, the initial data, 
comprising Year 0, was taken from April 2023, and 
an updated view on Year 1 was captured in June 
2024 from the Pharmaprojects database. Innovation 
and readiness to market were assessed for three 
categories of pipeline products:

1.  New assets that have entered the pipeline in the 

past year

2.  New assets that have entered the pipeline for 

that indication in the past year

3.  Phase 3 assets 

The absolute number of assets in the pipeline 
may not capture the full potential for innovation: 
e.g. a condition may have many assets that lead 
to incremental improvement or few approvals for 
actual treatments if over-indexed on early-stage 
development; others may have few assets, although 
those assets may lead to a leapfrog impact. That 
said, the more assets in the pipeline for a condition, 
the more likely an intervention for a condition may 
come to market and have potential to improve the 
standard of care over time.

Assessing pipeline assets as a proxy to 
understanding potential shifts in care delivery is 
complex. Given the long development times and 
resources required to ensure assets are making 
it to late-stage trial phases, a fraction of pipeline 
assets is approved out of total pipeline trials. 
Understanding innovation and where the standard 
of care may be improved is nuanced. 

Innovation and quantity of innovative assets for 
each prioritized condition were measured to track 
impact, with an additional focus on later-stage 
(Phase 3) assets that may come to market sooner. 

Readiness to market was also measured, with 
assets in later stages possibly more likely to come 
to market earlier, alongside those with similar 
assets on the market already in the indication and 
medications that are similar receiving expedited 
review designation.

From speaking with experts, looking at novel, first-
in-class assets for mechanisms of action is a core 
indicator of innovation, meaning assets that are the 
first of their kind for the mechanism of action in an 
indication. However, there are other specific criteria 
for innovation on an individual asset and indication 
basis that make the assessment challenging to 
scale to all indications. 

One such example is assets already launched and 
entering the pipeline for a new indication. This 
challenge is particularly complex when looking 
at oncology indications. It is often the case that 
early-stage oncology assets are trialled across 
multiple tumours, given the broad focus of oncology 
research and development initially. Once in trials, 
the indications narrow, and assets come to market 
specifically for indications. In this analysis, for 
example, there are assets in preclinical and Phase 1 
stages that fall into both breast and cervical cancer 
indications. With this in mind, assessing innovation 
by first-in-class for the indication is less applicable 
for oncology, even though often relevant once 
assets are advanced to later trial stages.

2.3.3 Metric 6:  
Number of clinical trials

Definition: Number of clinical trials per condition

Source: clinicaltrials.gov

Period: June 2023–May 2024 

Clinical trial data can be used to indicate research 
and funding focus areas and potential innovations 
in the care delivery pipeline. Clinical trial data 
can be a useful proxy for understanding industry 
and academic priorities. Active clinical trials with 
women enrolees registered with clinicaltrials.gov 
were assessed (1 June 2023 to 31 May 2024) 
to understand the location of trial settings, as 
compared to the burden of conditions in different 
income archetype regions. 

To understand the locations and number of clinical 
trials, clinicaltrials.gov and the international clinical 
trials registry platform were used. Condition-specific 
queries were created using the terms mentioned 
earlier, and the trials tagged under those conditions 
over the past year were downloaded and analysed. 
Trials were analysed for the location, split into the 
four income archetypes.

2.3.4 Metric 7:  
Sex-disaggregated data

Definition: Proportion of trials publishing sex-
disaggregated data

Source: clinicaltrials.gov

Period: January 2022–December 2022 

Sex-disaggregated research data is critical in the 
interpretation of research findings.193 Research has 
shown that this can improve the understanding of 
treatment effectiveness and potential sex-related 
differences in the effects of those treatments (e.g. 
side effects, efficacy, dosage, etc.).194,195 

To better understand the current state of sex 
disaggregation of data in the selected conditions,  
a comprehensive assessment identified relevant 
and published clinical trials completed from  
1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, captured 

the available published results and assessed 
these results to determine whether published data 
was disaggregated by sex. The clinicaltrials.gov 
database was used, with the search terms specified 
under migraine and ischaemic heart disease (IHD). 
This assessment was conducted only for migraine 
and for IHD, whereas the other seven conditions 
were excluded given they mostly or exclusively 
affect women. 

This metric was applicable to only two conditions, 
and the analysis was done manually. As clinical 
trial databases do not report in this level of detail, 
each trial examined was explored manually and 
one at a time as part of the assessment. It may 
be the case that some pharmaceutical companies 
do collect and review sex-disaggregated data and 
simply do not publish it. However, it is argued that 
the publication of data may be beneficial to advance 
scientific knowledge overall196 – for instance, sex-
disaggregated data published today may inform 
future publications or meta-analyses in the future and 
further the understanding of sex-based differences.

Condition-level 
metrics

3.1  Metric 1: Undercounting of prevalence

Definition: Estimate of real-world prevalence of 
endometriosis and menopause compared to global 
databases

Source: IHME, WHO, academic literature 

Period: IHME 2019 Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) dataset (the most recent academic study 
available) 

Undercounting the prevalence of women’s 
health conditions exacerbates the data gap and 
contributes to a more limited understanding of 
how burdensome these conditions are. Addressing 
prevalence can provide a more accurate picture 
of the number of women with a disease and 
the disease severity, contributing to increased 
awareness, better access to care and the 
possibility of enhanced treatments. This analysis 
focused solely on endometriosis and menopause; 
however, it is likely there are other gaps that are 
women-specific given current research. More 
analysis is needed.

In the McKinsey Health Institute’s analysis with 
the Forum, a data gap was uncovered for the 
undercounting of endometriosis and menopause 
prevalence globally. For these two conditions, there 
is an opportunity to address an estimated 6 million 
DALYs if the data gap was closed by 2040. 

Undercounting of prevalence was analysed by 
comparing the endometriosis disease burden 
based on the WHO prevalence and IHME disease 
weight and the IHME-reported endometriosis 
burden. Similarly for menopause, the difference was 
looked at between real disease burden based on 
prevalence sizing from academic literature and the 
IHME prevalence, for which menopause falls in the 
“other gynaecological conditions” bucket. Given the 
inclusion of menopause in this broad category of 
“other gynaecological conditions”, it is not possible 
to clearly identify the underlying prevalence, or the 
symptom severity associated with menopause in 
the data. As all women transition to menopause 
at some point, lack of complete data further 
compounds the limited understanding of the 
condition more broadly.

3.2  Metric 2: Number of patient registries

Definition: Number of patient registries that exist 
across countries for conditions

Source: Press search, Forum working groups

By establishing national patient registries for 
different conditions, enhanced care can be 
delivered to patients, with the hope of better  
patient outcomes. 

Period: Most recent year available 

Patient registries are observational studies that 
collect and store information about patients with 
conditions over time. They are important centres 
of data and knowledge, as they can inform on 
symptoms relating to conditions, medication use, 
use of care and other patient-reported outcomes. 

The current number of patient registries for 
endometriosis and for breast cancer were 
researched globally. Using input from the experts 
in Forum working groups, the team was able to 
identify these patient registries and validate sources 
across regions. In future years, an additional 
number of conditions will likely be included and 
further countries included.

3.3  Metric 3: Number of centres of excellence –  

endometriosis

Definition: Number of endometriosis centres of 
excellence globally

Source: Press search, Forum working groups

Period: Most recent year available 

Centres of excellence are one-stop locations for the 
diagnosis and treatment for patients with suspected 
endometriosis. They are a core way for women with 
endometriosis to receive consistent, evidence-based 
care, and are cost-effective centres of research and 
training. Centres of excellence were identified by the 
MHI and Forum teams in 15 countries.

3.4  Metric 4: Number of countries with published  

workplace guidance

Definition: Number of countries with menopause 
workplace guidance

Source: Press search, Forum working groups

Period: Most recent year available 

Workplace policies are an important part of 
improving menstrual health. Establishing workplace 
guidance on menopause could support awareness 

of menopause, help to retain top talent in the 
workforce and improve lifestyle interventions for 
menopause. The number of national guidelines for 
menopause in different countries was researched. 
Only the UK has an established guideline with 
its Equality and Human Rights Commission’s 
Menopause in the Workplace: Guidance for 
Employers and this policy is referenced as a 
potential avenue for other countries to establish 
national guidelines.

Period: Most recent year available

A metric to assess the number of skilled  
birth attendants per 1,000 births was selected 
across countries. This metric is important to  

track, as high rates of successful vaginal  
births attended by skilled birth attendants  
suggest positive maternal health outcomes  
and potentially reduced intervention rates.197  
Data was looked at from the WHO’s dashboard 
in July 2024, with the latest available data on 
proportion of births with skilled attendants as a 
percentage referenced.198 Data was available for 
14 out of the 15 prioritized countries, except for 
the United Kingdom.

3.6  Metric 6: Number of countries including HPV  
in their national vaccination programmes

Definition: Number of countries that include human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in their national 
vaccination programmes 

Source: HPV Information Centre, WHO

Period: July 2023

Four metrics were looked at specifically for cervical 
cancer, which relate to the HPV vaccine and 
screening for cervical cancer. 

The first metric uses data collected by the WHO 
and national health ministries to assess whether 
HPV vaccination is included in the country’s national 
programme. For this metric, the WHO collects data 
from the WHO Noncommunicable Disease (NCD) 
Country Capacity Survey, which includes a question 
on whether HPV vaccinations are included in 
national immunization schedules.199 Countries that 
mark Yes include HPV vaccination in the national 
vaccination schedule. This data is collected every 
two years, and the most recent report was released 
in July 2023. For Türkiye and India, data is not 
available yet, as national vaccination programmes 
are in the process of being introduced.200

3.7  Metric 7: Percentage coverage of the HPV    

vaccination programmes

Definition: Population coverage of the full-dose 
HPV vaccination regime

Source: HPV Information Centre, WHO

Period: July 2023

The next metric looks at the percentage of women 
and girls receiving full-coverage uptake of the HPV 
vaccine, by country. High percentage coverage 
within populations indicates progress towards 
preventing the primary cause of cervical cancer, 

HPV. The WHO estimates vaccination coverage 
across countries through the WHO/UNICEF Joint 
Reporting Form on Immunization,201 and the data is 
updated based on when countries report changes. 
Global data is updated each year in July to provide 
an overall view of vaccination coverage. The most 
recent data available was taken for this metric to 
understand country-level vaccination coverage. 
Data for Türkiye and India is not available because 
national vaccination programmes are in the process 
of being introduced.

test in vaccination programmes

Period: July 2023

Determining whether countries use the HPV test 
in their national vaccination programmes is also an 

indicator of whether the primary cause of cervical 
cancer is being prevented, and HPV testing is 
recommended by the WHO.202 Data was looked 
at globally from the HPV Information Centre 
which is part of the WHO’s International Agency 
for Research on Cancer. The database publishes 
information on indicators across cervical cancer, 
and this indicator was whether HPV tests are 
included in national vaccination programmes.

3.9  Metric 9: Number of countries with screening  

programmes in line with the WHO

Definition: Number of countries that have cervical 
cancer screening programmes in line with WHO 
recommendations

Source: HPV Information Centre, WHO

Period: July 2023

It is important to implement cervical cancer 
screening programmes nationally, as cervical 

cancer screening can allow earlier detection of 
cancer and can reduce the stigma associated with 
cervical cancer.203 The HPV Information Centre 
collects data on screening programmes, where 
the existence of official national recommendations, 
the year of implementation and screening ages 
are collected by country. For this metric, existence 
of cervical cancer screening by country was 
noted, with a count of how many countries have 
implemented screening programmes.

3.10   Metric 10: Percentage participation in screening  

  programmes

Definition: Proportion of women aged 25–65 
screened for cervical cancer

Source: HPV Information Centre, WHO

Period: July 2023

Linked to the previous metric, the HPV Information 
Centre also collects data on overall screening 

coverage. The proportion of women aged 25–65 
screened for cervical cancer is used as the primary 
indicator globally, with this metric tracking the 
percentage of women covered by country. The 
HPV Information Centre collects further data on the 
percentage of women screened for cervical cancer 
in the past five years, and in the past three years for 
a more granular view.

The WHO’s Mortality Dashboard and Global Cancer Database have different approaches to reporting age-standardized 
mortality data. The WHO dashboard also relies on data provided by civil registers that are submitted by countries, which 
can result in missing data. Where data is available, most is not disaggregated by relevant factors such as socioeconomic 
status, geographic location or age.

Diabetes was chosen as a comparator here due to its prevalence, affecting 1 in 10 people globally, a similar prevalence 
to a condition such as endometriosis, and its impact on burden of disease for both men and women. Diabetes was also 
used as a comparator across many of the other metrics.
