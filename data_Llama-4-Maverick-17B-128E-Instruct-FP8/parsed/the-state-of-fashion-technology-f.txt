Executive Summary

Technology has already revolutionised the 

way that global fashion companies do 
business. The Covid-19 pandemic further 
cemented the pivotal role technology 
plays in the industry, accelerating e-commerce 
adoption among consumers and further embedding 
digital tools in day-to-day workflows and decision 
making. Though the focal point to date has largely 
been on customer-facing technologies, brands now 
have an opportunity — born out of necessity in 
today’s volatile operating environment — to expand 
the breadth and depth of technology application 
in the industry. Fashion brands and retailers are 
leaning into technology not only to become more 
resilient to supply chain and other disruptions, but 
also to become more responsible and transparent as 
the world seeks sustainability solutions.

Against this backdrop, we expect fashion 

companies to ramp up their investments in 
technology, from between 1.6 and 1.8 percent 
of sales in 2021 to between 3 and 3.5 percent by 
2030. Investors, meanwhile, will pour capital into 
companies whose technologies aim to make fashion 
players more nimble and more environmentally 
and socially responsible. Fashion players that fail 
to embrace these technologies will face existential 
challenges, while their tech-savvy counterparts 
should see measurable bottom-line benefits. 
Technology’s impact is evident in key 
business areas, such as creating exceptional 
customer experience and engagement; helping to 
address sustainability issues; and upgrading internal 
processes and operations. This applies to fashion 
players across value segments, though the solutions 
may play out differently for luxury and mass market 
brands to accommodate varying customer needs and 
strategic priorities. 

This report identifies the business 

opportunities on which fashion leaders should 
focus their technology resources and investments, 
based on executive and other expert interviews, 
analyses of public and private companies, market 
intelligence and consumer research. By focusing on 

8

these opportunities, the report aims to help leaders 
look beyond hype and buzzwords to explore how 
technologies can alleviate real pain points and have a 
tangible impact on business results. 

When it comes to hype, there is no shortage 

in the matter of the metaverse — the interconnected, 
virtual ecosystem that overlaps with or offers an 
alternative to physical reality. But it is difficult — and 
potentially unwise — for fashion brands to ignore the 
fact that in 2021, global spending on virtual goods 
reached around $110 billion, more than double the 
total in 2015. That spend is expected to be worth at 
least $135 billion by 2024. While many experiments 
in the metaverse at this stage are largely marketing 
exercises, innovative fashion brands over the next 
five years could generate up to 5 percent of their 
revenue from activities in the metaverse. Virtual 
skins in digital worlds will be a big driver of that 
revenue stream, while NFTs can help to solve 
industry pain points and bolster customer loyalty.

We expect fashion companies 
to ramp up their investments in 
technology, from between 1.6 
and 1.8 percent of sales in 2021 
to between 3 and 3.5 percent 
by 2030.

As companies lean into digital opportunities, 

they will look to the hyper personalisation of 
experiences to increase customer loyalty. Shoppers 
have learned to expect curated, personalised service 
in other industries thanks to players like Netflix and 
Spotify, which harness AI to provide experiences 
specific to individual customer tastes and needs. But 
the fashion industry has been largely ill-equipped to 
move beyond basic customer segmentation owing to 
technology and talent restrictions. Brands that invest 
in AI modelling and Big Data to create one-to-one, 
personalised shopping experiences may see customer 
acquisition rates and sales increase as a result.

In a similar vein, executives should leverage 

technology in their physical stores to augment the 
omnichannel customer experience. As brands and 
retailers adopt and adapt in-store technologies, 
they will bridge the gap between online and offline 
channels. For example, in-store mobile apps for 
store associates can offer a frictionless way to serve 
customers, while in-store customer apps engage 
customers and result in more time spent in store. 
Meanwhile, beyond the shop floor, robotics and stock 
optimisation software, among other tools, can help 
brands and retailers set up micro-fulfilment centres, 
integrating physical stores as digital nodes in their 
distribution and delivery networks. Micro-fulfilment 
technologies can increase efficiency and reduce 
fulfilment costs by up to 90 percent, while also 
improving customer satisfaction thanks to faster 
delivery times.

Behind the scenes, technology is set to impact 

internal processes along the value chain, from 
demand forecasting to transport operations. While 
many parts of fashion companies’ value chains are 
already digitised, a challenge for many players is 
that digitisation has happened in siloes, creating 
bottlenecks and other inefficiencies when it comes 
to sharing data and knowledge between functions. 
As a result, fashion executives believe integrating 
digital processes throughout their organisations will 
be among their top-five areas for digitisation as they 
look ahead to 2025. The benefits of such integration 
include increased speed to market and full-price sell 
through rates, as well as lower manufacturing costs.

Digital connectivity of the supply chain 

is important in another key area for fashion: 
sustainability. Traceability software — which helps 
brands identify, monitor and manage products across 
entire lifecycles and in different parts of a supply 
chain — is essential for the industry’s sustainability 
efforts, while seeking to address demands from 
regulators, investors and customers for greater 
transparency around brands’ environmental and 
social impact. These traceability efforts cannot work 
in isolation, given the enormity and urgency of the 

sustainability challenge. Brands should consider 
joining forces with each other, start-ups and industry 
bodies to establish a common data standard, and to 
share data and knowledge via software platforms, 
open ledgers and Big Data technologies. 

For decision makers across value segments 

and at all stages of the technological adoption curve, 
this report translates each of these opportunities 
into clear, actionable steps for brands and retailers 
seeking to be part of fashion’s tech acceleration.

To date, few brands or retailers have 

embraced technology with a truly competitive 
mindset. Now, fashion and technology go hand 
in hand to enable companies to expand into new 
markets, win deeper levels of customer loyalty, 
and establish data-driven strategies and decision 
making. As fashion leaders seek further digital 
transformations across their organisations, they 
will need to prioritise technology and align their 
companies’ talent and resources accordingly.

INDUSTRY OUTLOOK

Get Ready for the Great  
Tech Acceleration

In 2021, fashion companies invested 

between 1.6 and 1.8 percent of their revenue in 
technology, on average.1 By 2030, that figure 
is expected to increase to between 3 and 3.5 
percent.2 Indeed, after a steady, decades-long 
technological ramp up focused on the digitisation 
of customer-facing interactions, fashion technology 
advancements are now accelerating across the 
entire value chain. With widespread automation 
and sharper AI-driven analytics, technology 
is eating fashion — from internal processes to 
customer experiences.3  

Why is this happening now? As experts 

point out, in the next decade we will witness more 
technological progress than in the past 100 years.4 
By 2024, AI-generated speech could 

power more than half of all human interactions 
with computers, while 50 percent of work across 
all industries could be automated by 2025, both 
with deep repercussions for the skills companies 
will need.5 Meanwhile, more than 75 percent of 
enterprise-generated data will be processed by 
cloud or edge computing,6 improving website 
and app loading times and enhancing customer 
experiences. By 2030, more than 80 percent of the 
global population is expected to have access to 5G 
networks,7 enabling faster connectivity and data 
transfer across Internet of Things devices.

Meanwhile, fashion consumers’ digital 

adoption, which was cemented by the pandemic, 
is set to endure. On average, people spent nearly 
4 hours per day on the internet on their mobile 
phones in 2021.8 Of the customers who made the 
move from offline to online shopping channels in 
2021, 48 percent said they did so because of the 
Covid-19 pandemic, 27 percent cited convenience, 
11 percent cited product availability and a further 
11 percent cited promotions.9 The pandemic also 

10

increased fashion customers’ digital interactions 
with brands, with 72 percent of customers reporting 
they interacted with brands online in 2021. In the 
year ahead, this is expected to stabilise at 66 percent 
on average.10  

Companies that leaned into technology to 
weather the pandemic and other recent challenges 
learned valuable lessons for excelling in today’s, 
and tomorrow’s, digital ecosystems. Those 
that have embedded AI technologies into their 
businesses to increase operational efficiencies 
and improve customer engagement could realise 
a 118 percent cumulative increase in cash flow by 
2030. For companies just starting on this journey, 
implementing AI-driven initiatives between now and 
2030 could generate a 13 percent increase in cash 
flow. Laggards with no such initiative before 2030 
should expect a 23 percent relative decline.11

Now, fashion executives must lean into 

technology to not only grow their businesses and 
optimise profitability and cash flow, but also to 
address the industry’s most pressing challenges 
— from hitting ambitious sustainability targets to 
de-risking their supply chains.

Thus, while a significant proportion of the 

industry’s investment in technology up until now has 
been directed towards e-commerce, digitisation of 
internal processes is now also moving into focus. The 
top-three areas in which fashion executives plan to 
make digital investments between now and 2025 are 
personalisation, store technologies and end-to-end 
value chain management.12

Brands from across segments are increasing 

investment in AI and machine learning for processes 
such as demand planning and pricing.13 14 15 Inditex 
committed to invest €2.7 billion (approximately 
$2.9 billion) in online capabilities and technology 
solutions under its 2020-2022 plan,16 while Nike is 

The State of Fashion: Technologyfails to be adopted by employees. Thus, technology 
investments need to be made wisely, and directed 
towards company change management as much as 
towards the core technologies themselves. 
Whatever the investment approach, 
executives will need to understand their companies’ 
appetite for change, creating an environment that 
enables a new digital culture, from factories to 
shop floors. For those that embrace change the 
competitive advantages are clear. 

accelerating its transformation by investing in digital 
capabilities such as demand forecasting, insight 
gathering and inventory management.17 Meanwhile, 
LVMH has partnered with Google Cloud to use 
cloud-based AI and machine learning technologies to 
enhance demand forecasting, inventory optimisation 
and personalised services.18

Moves such as these are creating a new 

paradigm for fashion, whereby the science of Big 
Data, advanced analytics and digital workflows 
are augmenting traditional creative processes. 
This transition will need to be underpinned by 
new talent capabilities, as brands seek to hire more 
data scientists, engineers and analysts, while also 
pursuing partnerships and acquisitions. 

As fashion executives consider where to focus 
their attention and direct their resources, we explore 
five technology-driven imperatives for the industry 
in this report: 
•  Metaverse Reality Check: Virtual goods and 

extended reality

•  Hyper Personalisation: Data- and AI-led 

marketing and e-commerce

•  Connected Stores: In-store customer 
experience with mobile apps and 
micro-fulfilment 

•  End-to-End Upgrade: AI-powered value chain 

integration

•  Traceability First: Blockchain and tracking 

technology for sustainability

Decision makers need to prioritise technology 
investments to seize these opportunities in ways 
that align with their business goals while preparing 
their organisations for a hyper-connected, fast-
evolving era of the industry. But integrating new 
technology can be resource intensive, especially if it 
is not a good strategic fit or lacks useability and thus

Technology in Fashion:  
A Quick Guide

As fashion and technology become ever more entwined, the lexicon of fashion is evolving 
rapidly. This quick guide introduces technologies influencing the industry today, which fashion 
professionals can deploy to develop use cases and strategies for adoption.

Computer-aided design (CAD) digitally produces 
product models and designs. In fashion, creatives can 
sketch and design in 3D CAD programmes, reducing the 
number of physical prototype and sample adjustments, 
increasing development speed, optimising costs and 
supporting sustainability by reducing or eliminating 
materials waste.

Computer vision, also known as image recognition, 
is a subset of AI that enables machines to derive 
information from images, videos and other visual 
inputs. In fashion, it allows users to scan visual data 
to identify patterns or styles. For example, a company 
can review e-commerce images to assess competitor 
products. The technology also automatically tags 
images uploaded to e-commerce sites with keywords 
to facilitate search for customers.

Digital workflows are a range of internal company 
processes that are converted to a digital format — for 
example, with enterprise resource planning software 
or internal communication platforms. Going digital can 
drive time and cost effectiveness. In fashion, digital 
workflows are being implemented across all parts of 
value chains.

Extended reality (XR) is an umbrella term that includes 
virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). VR 
immerses a person into an alternative world using 
hardware such as headsets, while AR adds a virtual 
layer to a person’s view of the physical world, for 
example with a smartphone filter. In fashion, AR enables 
customers to virtually try on clothing and accessories, 
while VR supports the creation of digital fashion in 
virtual worlds and gaming as well as virtual showrooms 
and runway shows. XR spans digital and physical worlds, 
helping customers express their ideas and creativity in 
virtual spaces.

Applied artificial intelligence (AI) recognises patterns 
in data and interprets those patterns to produce 
insights. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI, giving 
computers the ability to “learn” without being explicitly 
programmed. Deep learning (DL) is an advancement of 
ML that analyses data using a logical structure called a 
neural network. AI, ML and DL can be applied across the 
fashion value chain, helping decision makers to analyse 
complex data sets, streamline operations and improve 
productivity.

Big Data refers to data sets that are too large and 
complex to be stored and processed using conventional 
methods, thereby requiring a strong data backbone 
or core network and bespoke architecture. In fashion, 
insights from Big Data enable companies to offer 
customers personalised communication and predict 
their preferences. 

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology. 
It is a decentralised, transparent system of records, 
validated with an irreversible signature and shared 
by multiple users. Once added to the blockchain, 
information cannot be amended. In fashion, blockchain 
technologies support rising demand for sustainability-
driven traceability, supply chain transparency and 
product authentication at resale.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services 
over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, 
networking, software and analytics. In fashion, it can 
support flexible scaling, enabling companies to increase 
or decrease computer usage according to their needs. 
Edge computing is the practice of capturing and 
analysing data locally and in real time, significantly 
reducing latencies. This can help fashion companies 
accelerate production cycles and speed to market. 
Edge computing supports Internet of Things systems 
by enabling connectivity with devices such as mobile 
phones. Quantum computing harnesses quantum 
physics to represent and process information much 
faster than traditional computers. In fashion, it could be 
used to scale AI use cases, however the technology is in 
early development.

12

The State of Fashion: TechnologyInternet of Things (IoT) describes networks of physical 
objects (hardware) connected to each other through 
built-in sensors and IoT applications (software). 
These increasingly available and affordable devices 
can connect with other devices and systems. IoT is 
enhanced by 5G (fifth generation mobile network), 
which offers faster data speeds and a lower cost of data 
transfer than previous generations. In fashion, IoT is 
associated with wearables (for example, smart watches 
and smart glasses) and sensors that are embedded 
in products. IoT sometimes uses RFID to enable the 
exchange of information about products such as 
materials, origins or maintenance.

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses radio 
waves to automatically identify and track objects 
with an RFID tag (a small transponder carrying 
information) and a reader (a device that receives 
signals from the tag). Similarly, but covering a smaller 
distance than RFID, near-field communication (NFC) 
transfers data wirelessly between devices such as 
smartphones and tablets containing NFC chips. 
In fashion, both technologies track products and 
orders in real time, helping companies address pain 
points like counterfeiting or improve recycling and 
inventory management.

Robots are autonomous machines that perform tasks 
without human intervention, while cobots (such as a 
robotic arm) collaborate with humans. In fashion, robots 
and cobots are used mainly in garment manufacturing 
and warehouse management. They handle precise, 
repetitive and sometimes dangerous tasks, such as 
sewing, managing textiles and spraying. Automated 
guided vehicles (AGVs) are mobile robots that follow 
sensors embedded in the ground or use vision, magnets 
or lasers to autonomously navigate themselves. 
Other robots and cobots can be mounted onto AGVs. 
In fashion, they are most often used in industrial 
applications, warehouses and dark stores. Robotic 
process automation (RPA) is software that programmes 
the execution of repetitive digital tasks, which in fashion 
can accelerate routine tasks across the value chain — for 
example, organising and structuring data, scheduling 
and assigning daily tasks, or creating high-quality 
design renders using a predefined set of rules.

Zero trust security is an approach to IT security that 
requires every user or device trying to access a system to 
prove they are authorised to do so and are not hackers. 
The approach is useful in fashion due to the increases 
in remote working and cloud environments, volumes of 
sensitive customer and company data, and regulatory 
and customer expectations addressing data privacy and 
cyber risk.

of Fashion: 
Technology

Fashion players now have an opportunity to expand the 
breadth and depth of technology used throughout their 
businesses as tech advancements accelerate. Brands and 
retailers are leaning into technology not only to become more 
resilient to today’s volatile operating environment, but also 
to become more responsible and sustainable. This report 
highlights five technology-driven imperatives to help fashion 
executives understand where to focus their investments to 
solve some of the industry’s most pressing challenges.

THEME 04 
End-to-End Upgrade
Digital tools and analytics have transformed key parts of 
the fashion value chain, but these optimisations are often 
siloed within organisations, limiting the potential for 
cross-functional improvements. Brands should embark 
on end-to-end value chain integration to create more 
efficient and more profitable ways of operating.

01. METAVERSE REALITY CHECK

Pioneers in the metaverse have shown there 

is a business case for fashion brands to invest in 
virtual worlds. Granted, a fully formed metaverse 
— comprising an interconnected, virtual ecosystem 
that overlaps with or offers an alternative to 
physical reality — is not yet possible given 
technology constraints. But brands’ experiments 
with metaverse principles, such as virtual fashion, 
extended reality, gaming and non-fungible tokens 
(NFTs), demonstrate the impact that virtual 
activities can have as marketing and communi-
ty-building tools for fashion. Global spending on 
virtual assets reached around $110 billion in 202119 
and is expected to grow at roughly the same rate as 
the gaming market to be worth around $135 billion 
or higher by 2024.20  

Over the next two to five 
years, fashion brands focused 
on metaverse innovation and 
commercialisation could generate 
more than 5 percent of revenues by 
investing in virtual activities today.

The next frontier for leading brands will be 

to translate unproven technologies into sustainable 
revenue streams, effectively separating hype from 
reality. Over the next two to five years, fashion 
brands focused on metaverse innovation and 
commercialisation could generate more than 5 
percent of revenues by investing in virtual  
activities today.21

Looking beyond a five-year horizon, some 
bullish observers expect mass consumer adoption 
of virtual worlds, creating the biggest opportunity 
for the fashion industry since e-commerce. The 
bears predict that the hype around the metaverse 
will fade as technologies fail to meet expectations 
or users prove reluctant to use virtual spaces as 
extensively as some business plans are counting on. 
While it is uncertain whether a meaningful 

number of consumers will develop fully fledged 

virtual lives and spend most of their time in the 
metaverse, significant revenue opportunities for 
fashion brands will emerge. 

The pace of adoption will be driven by 

technological advancement, the interoperability 
between virtual environments and social 
acceptance. Tech players as well as fashion 
start-ups and brands need to develop technologies 
that help evolve today’s unrefined virtual 
experiences into mature, immersive realities. Mass 
consumer adoption could be a significant hurdle — 
78 percent of people who have already ventured into 
virtual worlds say they miss physical interaction 
when doing so.22 

As a result, many players will likely hang 
back to see evidence of commercialised use cases 
and a tangible ROI before investing. For others 
that want to capture the commercial opportunity, 
the biggest short-term revenue potential lies with 
virtual assets that can be traded, transferred or 
used for payment. We identify two clear use cases 
for virtual assets that have long-term potential: 

AR Fashion and Virtual Skins
In virtual spaces and on social media platforms, the 
appetite for creating and adapting online identities 
is high: approximately 70 percent of US consumers 
from Gen-Z to Gen-X rate their digital identity as 
“somewhat important” or “very important.”23 A 
similar appetite for virtual goods can be found in 
China, where 70 percent of luxury consumers have 
purchased or will consider purchasing  
virtual assets.24 

Some companies are using augmented 

reality (AR), to enable users to alter photos and 
videos, and are creating digital skins to change 
the appearance of a user’s avatar. For example, 
digital fashion start-up DressX, which sells virtual 
clothing that can be added to a photo and posted 
on social media, has partnered with brands such as 
H&M to launch digital collections.25 26 Meanwhile, 
users on online gaming platforms such as Roblox 
update their avatars with new skins regularly, 

18

The State of Fashion: Technologyeven daily in some cases.27 The potential revenue 
generation of in-game outfits and accessories can 
be significant. Gucci sold a virtual version of its 
Dionysus bag for the equivalent of $6 on Roblox, 
which later led to bids of more than $4,000 per bag 
when resold on the secondhand market.28 29

The multi-billion-dollar gaming market will 

continue to offer opportunities for fashion — the 
market for gaming skins could reach $70 billion by 
2024, up from $40 billion in 2020.30 Brands will 
need to turn to established gaming and platform 
partners to find inroads. 

Still, as with any nascent technology, there 

are risks. For one, brands — particularly those in 
luxury — should be aware of selling “cheap” digital 
items that could weaken the exclusivity of their 
brand image. AR technology is at a relatively early 
phase of development, where glitchy or unwieldy 
applications can undermine the user experience. 

Furthermore, if brands choose to partner 

with virtual platforms, in gaming or otherwise, the 
top-line opportunity may be dampened by high 
take rates, which could reach as high as 50 percent 
commission on revenues.31

NFTs as Digital Twins and Loyalty Tokens
Much of the frenzy about blockchain-based NFTs 
has been centred around digital art collectibles, 
which are in some cases bought and traded for 
inordinate sums, driving news headlines as some 
observers scratch their heads. The compound 
annual growth rate of the value of the NFT market 
skyrocketed 750 percent between 2018 and 2021, 
from $41 million to $24.9 billion.32 

But the rapid rate of growth in NFT sales 
is already starting to moderate. Indeed, the daily 
trading volume on NFT marketplace OpenSea fell 
by 80 percent between February and March 2022.33

01. METAVERSE REALITY CHECK

NFT sceptics suggest that this could indicate the 
bursting of a bubble in an unsustainable market 
with a limited number of active customers and 
rampant hoaxes and scams. 

However, even as the hype subsides, use 

cases will emerge that address industry pain 
points and consumer desires with applications that 
support community building, product traceability 
and authenticity. 

The long-term business opportunity for 
fashion brands to engage with NFTs will likely 
serve more pragmatic purposes by using NFTs as 
“loyalty tokens.” Gucci, Adidas and The Hundreds, 
among others, have used NFTs to offer benefits 
like early access to new NFT drops and physical 
products, essentially serving as a membership 

programme.34 In a sense, these NFTs are digital 
collectibles, since users cannot yet wear them in 
virtual worlds, though they could use them for 
social media profiles. Brands are starting to add 
more “utility” to collectible NFTs, which could 
make buying one more worthwhile to consumers 
and translate into a long-term opportunity  
for brands. 

We see the most compelling use case 

for NFTs as digital twins that host information 
about a physical or digital product’s history, 
authenticity and ownership — something that 
is especially beneficial to the luxury segment in 
its battle against counterfeiting. Twins enable 
products to be paired with a theoretically tamper-
proof record and unlock the ability for brands to

and industry initiatives such as Aura Blockchain 
Consortium, Lablaco and Arianee are aiming to 
make blockchain-based digital twins commonplace. 
Lablaco is working to link its digital IDs to virtual 
versions of garments, so that customers can engage 
in augmented reality experiences such as try-ons.

Partner, Build, Acquire
While a few disruptors, such as marketplaces for 
digital fashion, will solely focus on virtual goods, 
most tech-savvy, innovative brands will tap the 
opportunity to diversify revenue streams and 
target Gen-Z and Millennial consumers. Players 
that want to experiment in the metaverse but lack 
the requisite in-house capabilities can:
•  Partner with gaming or tech companies, as 
Gucci did in its tie-up with Zepeto, a social 
network and avatar simulation app, to produce 
paid-for digital skins,35 or as Burberry did 
when it partnered with Tencent to launch a 

limited-edition scarf with the Chinese virtual 
influencer Ayayi.36 

•  Build their own capabilities by recruiting 
talent with tech-related skills alongside a 
deep-rooted understanding of the metaverse 
and its communities, as Balenciaga is doing by 
creating a “metaverse business unit” dedicated 
to metaverse marketing and commerce.37

•  Make acquisitions, along the lines of Nike’s deal 
to buy virtual fashion studio RTFKT in 2021.38 

Like the early days of e-commerce, some 
metaverse-related ventures are likely to fail 
outright or need rapid iteration. However, fashion 
is well placed to capitalise on the engagement with 
virtual worlds and the metaverse, owing to its 
connection to self-expression, status and creativity. 
Executives should consider metaverse strategies 
based on their companies’ digital ambitions and 
customer targets.

Accross the varied funding taking place in  

  fashion tech, investors are emphasising  
  technologies that make commerce more  
  nimble, more sustainable and more 

engaging to shoppers, whether they’re buying their 
goods new or used, in stores or online. Many are also 
making non-fungible token (NFT) and metaverse-
related moves, but they’re starting slowly in these 
areas and doing their research to determine what 
opportunities lie beyond NFTs as collectibles.

In 2021, the value of the top 50 investments 

in technology related to fashion grew 66 percent 
compared to 2019, reaching $16.2 billion, according 
to McKinsey analysis of data from Crunchbase, a 
business-information platform.39 The investments 
considered in this analysis went towards either 
fashion retailers or businesses selling products 
and services to fashion firms, rather than fashion 
brands. E-commerce, having benefitted from 
the pandemic-driven surge in online shopping, 
received roughly 55 percent of the investment. The 
remainder largely comprised payment technol-
ogies, including “buy now pay later” firms, social 
commerce and resale, followed by supply chain and 
logistics companies and those working in NFTs or 
technologies like virtual reality.

Investors say e-commerce has room for 

further growth and innovation. For instance, new 
marketplace models that are “inventory light” 
and help individual creators and sellers have been 
one area of focus for Forerunner Ventures, a San 
Francisco-based fund.40

“On the back end — the commerce- 
enablement side, where we spend a lot of our time 
investing — there’s been a tonne of innovation 
on the enabling tools and technologies powering 
anybody to be a seller, whether you are an 
incumbent brand or a creator or somebody just 
getting going,” said Nicole Johnson, a partner at 
Forerunner. As an example, Johnson cited Canal, 
a distributed commerce platform that aims to 
let individuals and companies of any size sell 
products on the same channels where customers 
first encounter them, such as YouTube or Substack. 
Forerunner has been one of the lead backers of the 
Bay Area start-up, which went live in 2021.

Frederic Court, founder of London’s Felix 

Capital, highlighted marketplaces as an area of 
interest as well, such as those that have their own 
strong point of view and emphasise a curated 
shopping experience. “In a world where there is 
so much choice, curation itself is a very important 
theme,” he said.41 

Consumer-facing fashion tech has drawn 
most of the investment in recent years, and that’s 
still the case. Social commerce, for example, saw a 
jump in funding in 2021, driven largely by a $500-
million raise by China’s Xiaohongshu.42

At Swedish fast-fashion giant H&M, 
executives are looking to e-commerce innovations 
that allow it to blur the line between online and 
in-store experiences and offer customers the same 
level of personalisation across channels. Alan 
Ting, the company’s head of M&A, described one 
potential idea where customers could log their 
purchases in a “digitised wardrobe,” and then when 
visiting a store, the H&M app would guide them to 
products they might like based on past purchases. 
The company is also continuing its investments 
in analytics and AI to leverage its massive trove of 
customer data, he noted.43 

In 2021, the value of the top 
50 investments in technology 
related to fashion grew 66 
percent compared to 2019.

Supply chains and logistics continue to 
draw investor interest. In late 2020, Singapore-
based Lyra Ventures participated in a funding 
round for Material Exchange, a centralised 
materials database company.44 Reina Nakamura, a 
general partner at Lyra, said the database can help 
individual creators as well as brands competing 
against the likes of fast fashion juggernaut Shein to 
be nimbler in production. 

Because of its digitised supply chain, Shein 

has visibility into the availability of materials 
that can be whipped into orders, making it more 
agile than brands relying on the traditional model 
of attending trade shows, exchanging physical 

23

as one of several key investment targets, alongside 
data analytics and social commerce.50 He joined a 
$2.7-million funding round for Reflaunt, a “resale-
as-a-service” technology company that supplies 
the backend infrastructure allowing brands and 
retailers to plug into a network of secondhand 
marketplaces and launch their own resale 
businesses.51

Meanwhile, Lyra’s Nakamura pointed to 

resale logistics companies, such as Lizee, a French 
start-up founded in 2019 focusing on logistics 
solutions for rental and resale brands — something 
she said traditional warehouse-management 
systems aren’t designed to do. Lizee raised €1.3 
million ($1.55 million) in a seed round in 2021.52
While many of these investments aim to 
solve current industry pain points, investors are 
also keeping an eye on the future. Web3 and the 
metaverse are inescapable topics, and while capital 
is pouring into metaverse-related companies, 
investment on the fashion and retail side is 
just getting started. Johnson, for instance, said 
Forerunner is “walking before we run and thinking 
about where the consumer utility is and the biggest 
opportunities for mass consumer adoption in  
those spaces.”

But money is beginning to flow. Denis and 

Nakamura separately have backed Threedium, 
whose technology lets brands and retailers 
create 3D and augmented reality assets for use in 
e-commerce and a range of gaming environments. 
Nakamura described the company as a “backbone 
of everything 3D.”

H&M launched its first virtual fashion 
collection at the start of 2022. The company is 
working to understand what competencies it needs 
to develop — or acquire — in the space, according 
to Ting. “For sure, we’re going to need to offer our 
products in a digital fashion,” he said.

samples and producing fabrics to order, according 
to Nakamura.

“This has always become the bottleneck for 

any agile upstream supply chain to be built, and I 
think Shein has really changed the game here,”  
she said.45

Similarly, in 2021, Forerunner co-led a 

funding round for Swyft, which connects shipping 
carriers with vendors to let them offer same-day 
delivery and compete against Amazon’s logistics 
machine, Johnson said.

Resale is offering investors both a 

sustainability play and a growing market of 
shoppers, particularly younger ones. In recent 
consumer surveys from BoF Insights, 65 percent of 
respondents aged 18 to 24 said they have purchased 
secondhand fashion before.46 

Web3 and the metaverse are 
inescapable topics, and while 
capital is pouring into metaverse-
related companies, investment 
on the fashion and retail side is 
just getting started.

H&M has said it will double its investments 
in 2022, focusing on areas such as tech and supply 
chain, renewable energy and sustainable materials. 
H&M’s most significant investments in fashion 
tech, for instance, have focused on Sellpy, the 
secondhand site it acquired in 2019, Ting said. In 
2021 it launched Sellpy in 20 additional countries, 
bringing its total number of markets to 24, and 
told Reuters it has invested more than €20 million 
($24.4 million) in the business.47

Beyond H&M, resale companies including 

Vestiaire Collective, Grailed and Tradesy held 
funding rounds in 2021.48 Etsy acquired the Gen-Z-
focused secondhand marketplace Depop, and more 
brands now offer resale of their own goods.49 

Pierre Denis, former chief executive of 
Jimmy Choo and now a fashion-tech investor 
based in London, pointed to the resale economy

tools and technologies to upgrade how they customise and 
personalise their customer relationships. The opportunity for 
executives now is to harness Big Data and AI to provide 
one-to-one experiences that build long-term loyalty.

26

KEY INSIGHTS

•  Advanced personalisation techniques are playing out across industries, setting a high bar 
for fashion brands — 71 percent of consumers expect companies to deliver personalised 
interactions and a similar proportion say it is frustrating when this does not happen.

•  Competition for customer attention is intensifying and conversion costs are rising amid 

new privacy restrictions and limits on third-party data collection.

•  Players can drive customer lifetime value by pushing beyond basic segmentation and  
ad hoc targeting to hyper-personalised shopping experiences across all touchpoints.

02. HYPER PERSONALISATION

It’s no secret that fashion brands need to 
make highly personalised customer experience 
a cornerstone of their digital businesses. Their 
customers expect nothing less. Consumers have 
had their personalisation expectations redefined by 
the likes of Netflix, Spotify and Amazon. Shoppers 
expect brands to provide them with product choices 
and experiences that are tailored to their individual 
preferences. Indeed, 71 percent of global consumers 
want companies to deliver personalised communi-
cations and products, and 76 percent are unhappy 
when this is not offered.53 

Not so long ago, a personalised experience in 

fashion was something only very high-end, luxury 
shoppers could receive. Luxury boutique associates 
would lavish attention on key customers, manually 
recording an individual’s personal tastes and 
shopping habits in notebook after notebook to help 

Exhibit 5:

them tailor their service. Building a long- 
lasting rapport with these shoppers was an 
exclusive, elaborate, not to mention  
inefficient, exercise. 

Shoppers expect brands to provide 
them with product choices and 
experiences that are tailored to 
their individual preferences.

Fast forward to today and brands are facing 
a convergence of factors that make personalisation 
a priority. Declining brand loyalty among 
customers and increased competition for attention 
from social media platforms, along with tightening 
regulations and moves by Apple and Google to 
modify access to third-party data, are all impacting

the ability of brands to connect with customers 
online.54 55 56 Now more than ever, personalisation 
can hold the key for brands to capture market share.
That said, the fashion industry today 

generally confines personalisation to marketing 
recommendations for customer sub-segments, 
based on past purchases or online browsing history, 
held back by talent and technology constraints. 
There’s scope to go further. For the first time, 
businesses have tools that enable them to work with 
all types of data across channels in real time. 
 This is evident in e-commerce, where 

platforms powered by cloud-based technologies 
could run AI or machine learning algorithms 
to accelerate the processing and analysis of Big 
Data on customer behaviour.57 The result of 
these analytical capabilities would mean brands 
are equipped to provide hyper-personalised, 
one-to-one experiences — similar to those of 
the sales associate in an exclusive boutique, but 
available to customers across all fashion segments, 
from high street to luxury.

Offering hyper personalisation will require 
companies to reimagine how e-commerce operates. 
Search-based shopping is likely to shift to the indi-
vidualised discovery of products and styles offered 
in the right size and fit. All customers will have a 
curated experience on their own versions of brand 
websites and marketplaces, from landing page to 
payment, akin to their experience on social media 
feeds. With this, companies will use personalisation 
technology to build experiences that drive 
customer engagement and, ultimately, loyalty. 

Fashion retailer Zalando has taken steps 

towards this vision. It uses data analytics to offer its 
customers millions of tailored “Zalando interfaces.” 
By incorporating preferences into its algorithm, 
product displays are automatically tailored to 
each customer, from size to their favourite brands. 
The retailer is also exploring 3D body scanning 
technology to enhance size and fit selections.58
Another company embracing this 
opportunity is The Yes. The fashion marketplace 
has built an extensive product taxonomy while also 

29

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
02. HYPER PERSONALISATION

deploying machine learning and computer vision 
to synthesise hundreds of data points for each 
product. The algorithm then translates shopper 
preferences into a personalised exploration feed.59

Meanwhile, styling service Stitch Fix tailors 

products to customers’ tastes and needs and uses 
a discovery tool called “style shuffle” to help users 
indicate designers they like.60 Fast-fashion player 
Shein offers each customer a scrollable feed of 
products powered by a real-time recommendation

social media and other channels.61

Offering hyper personalisation will 
require companies to reimagine 
the way that fashion e-commerce 
operates across platforms — a 
potentially complex, fast-evolving 
challenge.

Looking ahead in the luxury segment, 
hyper personalisation is set to also play out in 
physical stores. Store associates can leverage 
first-party data to provide customers with a unique 
experience no matter which store they enter, 
taking in-store clienteling to the next level. What’s 
more, as technologies advance, it is feasible that 
brands will be able to create digital wardrobes for 
each customer along with personalised styling 
recommendations. 

Offering hyper personalisation will require 

companies to reimagine the way that fashion 
e-commerce operates across platforms — a 
potentially complex, fast-evolving challenge that 
can overwhelm brands. This can be managed by:

management platforms and third-party cookies 
less relevant. 

•  Solution: Brands need to maximise their 
first-party data collection to enable 
personalisation across platforms and channels. 
This can happen, for example, through loyalty 
programmes that help identify and link 
customer purchases online and offline. In-store 
apps can also track offline browsing behaviour, 
and brands can create campaigns that collect 
data in exchange for loyalty points or discounts. 
In these efforts, brands need to be mindful 
of adhereing to data privacy regulations (e.g. 
GDPR in Europe). 

Creating a 360-degree customer view
•  Challenge: When shopping for fashion, 

customers can generate a vast amount of data 
across channels and platforms — ranging from 
location data to website or app engagement 
time. This data tends to be unstructured, in 
multiple formats and scattered across different 
databases. In isolation, this provides little or no 
insight. 

•  Solution: Brands need to establish a complete 
customer profile connected to a unique ID 
across data sources and channels. A customer 
data platform is needed to host all data assets 
and consolidate the customer view, as are 
rigorous data standardisation and cleaning 
processes. The result is brands could create 
a single dataset that joins up customer 
preferences and behaviours at a granular 
level across platforms, channels and product 
categories. For retailers, this could also span 
data from different brands. Companies should 
consult current data legislation when creating 
these customer profiles.

Accelerating first-party data collection 
•  Challenge: Changes to data privacy laws and 
restrictions on third-party data collection 
in various jurisdictions have rendered data 

Aligning the ‘human touch’ and AI
•  Challenge: Fashion customer behaviour 

can be difficult to predict, not least because

The State of Fashion: Technologyof fashion’s rapid trend cycles and the low 
levels of repeat purchasing among individual 
shoppers. Furthermore, a stand-alone 
personalised algorithm might not align with 
a brand’s strategic priorities without human 
intervention. 

•  Solution: Players need to develop advanced AI 
models, such as those that display products 
and photo styles best suited to the individual 
customer, or models that use advanced size and 
fit algorithms. These models should incorporate 
behavioural data, such as login time and 
add-to-cart behaviours, along with nuances 
relating to the brand’s market and segment 
positioning. 

Scaling personalisation solutions 
•  Challenge: A significant platform upgrade 
is required to deliver sophisticated, hyper-
personalised e-commerce content, which is 
informed by thousands of data points and 
delivered across multiple channels with 
ultra-fast loading times. 

Exhibit 6:

•  Solution: A company’s portfolio of design and 
distribution tools needs to include content 
management systems that can standardise, 
centralise and distribute digital elements to 
support marketing alongside content delivery 
networks that help deliver thousands of unique 
landing and content pages. Their portfolio 
should also include an e-commerce platform for 
their website and app, so that brands can deliver 
personalisation to every customer across  
all journeys.

A priority for executives should be to establish 
hyper personalisation as a core competency. Brands 
will need to invest strategically across all their data 
and analytics activations, from collection to cross-
channel implementation. In many cases, this will 
mean setting up a dedicated cross-functional team, 
comprising product managers, marketing domain 
experts, software engineers and data scientists. 
Brands that set themselves up to win will hone their 
ability to deliver intelligent, targeted marketing 
and e-commerce solutions for every customer.

Companies need a full range of analytics capabilities for a new

EXECUTIVE INTERVIEW

Zalando: Bringing Data Science 
to the Art of Fashion Retail

by Marc Bain

Robert Gentz
Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive, Zalando

32

AI and other technologies are critical to how the fashion 
giant matches millions of customers with the right product 
in the right fit, says co-founder and co-chief executive Robert 
Gentz, and now the company is looking to innovations like 
augmented reality as it seeks to capture more market share.

Zalando is Europe’s 

largest online-only 
fashion retailer, but 
there’s another way it 
often describes itself: Europe’s 
most fashionable tech company. 
Technology has been central to 
how the company operates since 
its founding in 2008 in Berlin. 
Today it uses data to optimise 
everything from how it buys 
products from brand partners to 
how it delivers items to customers. 
It also leverages technologies, 
including AI, to deliver shoppers 
a more personalised experience 
on its site and app. The approach 
has worked: in its 2021 fiscal year, 
total merchandise volume on its 
platform rose 34 percent year on 
year to €14.3 billion ($15.7 billion), 
bringing in revenue of €10.4 
billion.62 

Robert Gentz, co-founder and 
co-chief executive, is helping to 
steer Zalando to its next goal: 
by 2025, it expects merchandise 
annual sales to top €30 billion as 
it aims to capture more than 10 
percent of the European fashion 
market.63 It’s a lofty ambition, 
and far from guaranteed as 
competition grows online. If 
Zalando is to achieve it, it must 
continue to set itself apart, and 
technology will be vital in  
the effort.

Personalisation has been a 
major focus at Zalando for 

years and is a key part of the 
customer experience it offers. 
Why is it so important for the 
company?
On Zalando you have 1.4 
million different items. It is a 
huge selection. And then you 
have 48 million customers. 
Using technology and data to 
bring the right customer to 
the merchandise, or the right 
merchandise to the customer, is 
important because, for these 1.4 
million choices, how do you make 
sure that she finds one item? So 
we're trying to use technology to 
personalise it for customers as 
much as we can. It comes down to 
the matchmaking problem: how 
do you matchmake merchandise 
with customers?

Which technologies are you 
using for this task?
It's AI. There’s one program 
that is running, an algorithmic 
fashion companion, which is 
based on items that you have 
bought in the past. The algorithm 
combines fitting items to [create] 
an outfit, which we have learned 
through how people combine 
[items]. When you look at 
click-through rates and buy-
through rates, the outfits we're 
producing are hitting the mark 
of what customers want. So it's 
algorithms that are continuously 
improving with feedback loops 
from customer data as well 

as human feedback that we 
internally produce. 

What are some of the ways a 
customer’s experience on the 
site or app is tailored to them?
First of all, in onboarding you 
already have an opportunity to 
express brands you like, your 
sizes. That personalises the 
site already for you. In terms of 
the product and merchandise 
to the teasers that you see, it is 
customised so the Zalando shop 
looks different to every single 
customer once they actually have 
an interaction with us.

What metrics does Zalando 
look at to determine if these 
efforts are successful? 
Sometimes the short-term 
metrics are not always the ones 
that lead to the right long-term 
answers. If you want to just 
optimise click-through rates, then 
the items that might be the most 
fancy ones have the highest click-
through rates but are probably 
not the ones that create the right 
offering, the right experience 
in the long term. What we are 
mostly optimising is long-term 
customer lifetime value, and the 
long-term customer lifetime 
value is generated through 
complex algorithms that [factor] 
how much time you spent on 
site, how much are you browsing 
and what are you buying — it's

different sets of [key performance 
indicators]. 

Discovery of new products is 
one type of value a retailer can 
offer shoppers, but if shoppers 
are getting personalised 
recommendations based on 
past behaviour, does that limit 
their chances of discovering 
new items they might love but 
that aren’t like what they’ve 
bought in the past? Does 
Zalando take any steps to 
account for this?
Just looking at the past does not 
always answer the question for 
the future. What we actually 
take a lot of inspiration from 
is how the music industry is 
trying to solve the problem. You 
cannot only do it by machines 
and past behaviours. You always 
have to mix in new and modern 
fashion elements. This is where 
the fashion people help the 
technology people. 

So there’s still old-fashioned 
human curation in the 
process?
Yeah. In the end it’s all about 
emotion. Nobody wants to 
just shop in a big automated 
warehouse. It is about the art as 
much as it's about the science.

Determining the right size 
and fit of a product remains 
one of the biggest obstacles 
shoppers face when buying 
online. Zalando has invested 
heavily to help solve this 
issue. It acquired a virtual 
dressing room company in 
2020,64 has an an entire size 
and fit department, and is 
establishing a technology hub 
in Zurich dedicated to the 
task. How is Zalando using 
technology to solve or at least 
reduce these issues, and what 
 solutions is it exploring?

34

What we're trying to achieve is by, 
probably 2030, you don't really 
need the physical changing room. 
You have the same experience 
everywhere. What we are doing 
at this stage is mostly based on 
data we get from our customers 
to help them make better choices. 
It's very much based on returns 
— why you return a certain item — 
and customer feedback. 

We have many customers who 
order a very wide range of 
products and across brands. A 
customer returns an item, and 
another customer returns 
exactly the same item for the 
same reason, but kept a similar 
one. You get a data graph — a 
graph of fitting — and based 
on that we're able to make 
recommendations with existing 
customers with whom we have 
a deep relationship on whether 
items fit or not. We have already 
been able to reduce size-related 
returns by 10 percent. The next 
iteration of this will be when we 
move more towards whole-body 
measurements and experiment 
much more with 3D technology 
and body measurement 
technology. 

Logistics is another complex 
area. How is Zalando using 
AI or other technologies to 
manage logistics?
One of the biggest tech teams we 
have is working on convenience 
and logistics. An interesting 
problem is where do you allocate 
an item with the [greatest] 
proximity to a customer across a 
warehouse network, which is very 
important to drive sustainability 
and delivery times by avoiding 
single-item shipments. Where 
you have size and brand and other 
items, it gets very granular. This 
is a very big data and algorithmic 
problem.

Are there features of Zalando’s 
organisational structure that 
allow it to better integrate 
technology and data? Even 
companies that want to make 
the best use of technology 
aren’t always set up for it. 
Departments might be siloed, 
for example, so they’re not 
looking at the same data to 
make decisions.
One of the big things that we 
at least try to do is to bring 
cross-functional teams together 
as much as we can. We have 
about 2,500 software engineers 
working at Zalando in various 
teams. When we have large-scale 
projects, we try to bring the 
different disciplines to the table 
and have them all looking at this 
problem.

One of the big challenges 
companies face is making 
sure all the data they’re 
relying on is clean, and then 
they need to be able to derive 
valuable insights from it. How 
does Zalando tackle these 
challenges?
I wouldn't say we are perfect at 
this, but we're very focused on 
it. We set ownerships for specific 
amounts of data we produce in 
terms of who is responsible for 
it and have constant discussions 
about how we get better data. It’s 
a culture of data cleanliness.

AR and VR have gained more 
attention as everyone talks 
about the metaverse. Are 
there emerging technologies 
or applications Zalando sees 
as being able to have a big 
impact in the future?
Coming back to the real-life 
problems of size and fit, this 
augmented reality space might 
be a good catalyst to produce real 
breakthroughs in terms of solving

the virtual try-on experience for 
customers and having definite 
answers if an item fits you 
personally or not, before you 
have it physically in your hand. 
It's something that we feel quite 
passionate about, that this part 
of the metaverse might actually 
help us to solve big problems on 
the size-and-fit and sustainability 
area. When it comes to a purely 
virtual world and to items that 
only live virtually, we're still 
exploring.

Even as e-commerce has 
grown, stores are still 
where most sales happen. In 
2018, Zalando launched its 
Connected Retail platform to 
offer inventory from physical 
stores. How is Connected 
Retail progressing and how 
does technology enable that 
programme?
Throughout the pandemic 
obviously this scaled quite a 
lot, so there's now about 7,000 
stores that are trading on 
Connected Retail. It's a big piece 
of the partner programme. How 
technology can help [is that] we 

actually provide [partners] with 
an interface. It doesn't require 
any integrations into a store. It 
requires a match of the inventory 
a store has with a database so 
that customers can order from it, 
and it requires a certain interface 
with regards to physical aspects of 
the logistics. In the future, where 
it gets much more interesting is 
when we are able to combine this 
with our local delivery efforts [to] 
enable customers who want to 
order inventory that is close by.

Zalando says it wants to have 
a net-positive impact — that is, 
running the company “in a way 
that gives back more to society 
and the environment than 
we take.”65 It’s a big goal and 
something much of the fashion 
industry is thinking about. 
What role can technology play 
here?
I think a lot of the challenges 
in fashion with regards to 
sustainability — with regards 
to size and fit, overproduction, 
resource allocation, 
personalisation and so on — is 
fundamentally a data and 

collaboration problem. As fashion 
brands get more data-savvy 
in terms of their own supply 
chain — they don't need to be 
more tech-savvy but I think more 
data-savvy — and collaborative, 
we can all jointly produce a 
fashion ecosystem which makes 
more sense and is less resource-
consuming. 

What we're trying ourselves is 
to work with brands very early 
in the design process to make 
sense of how data can help the 
entire process. Less resources are 
consumed, at least for us in terms 
of delivery and returns. It creates 
more profit pools for everyone, 
and this can be reinvested. But 
generally what to me is very 
clear is, in the end, it's about 
data, it's about collaboration, 
data exchange. Many of the 
problems that we're seeing in 
terms of overproduction, in terms 
of wrong production, or not 
designing for circularity, can be 
solved in the long term.

CONNECTED STORES

The inexorable rise of e-commerce has forced fashion players 
to rethink the role of physical stores. Fashion executives can 
address consumer pain points by using in-store mobile 
apps to enhance the experience and micro-fulfilment 
technologies to leverage their physical retail networks  
for the quick-commerce era.

36

KEY INSIGHTS

•  Despite the acceleration of digital shopping habits, 60 percent of customers in Europe 
still want to shop in stores so they can browse and touch physical products before 
purchasing. In store, customers who engage with technology spend up to four times 
longer shopping than those who do not.

•  Mobile apps provide a frictionless shopping journey for different types of shoppers, 

whether it’s those seeking convenience or an engaging, social experience.

•  Micro-fulfilment technologies enable brands to process orders efficiently from stores, 
reducing associated costs by up to 90 percent, and can help companies adapt to 
today’s quick-commerce environment, thus leading to higher conversion and customer 
satisfaction rates.

TECH ENABLERS

•  Cloud computing to support robotics and run advanced analytics in real time 

across store and distribution networks.

•  Last mile optimisation software to boost the efficiency of order delivery.

•  Mobile applications to optimise in-store service and customer experiences.

•  RFID to track products and stock levels in real time.

•  Robotics to automate order fulfilment.

•  Stock optimisation software to automatically allocate inventory across store 

and distribution networks.

03. CONNECTED STORES

The rules of physical retail are changing. 

Pressure on the economics of operating stores has 
been mounting, particularly since more and more 
consumers began embracing the convenience — 
and safety — of e-commerce during the Covid-19 
pandemic. 

But physical retail is far from dead. A 2020 

survey of European consumers showed that 60 
percent of respondents wanted to see or touch 
products in-person before buying, while 50 percent 
shopped in stores so they can take items home 
immediately. As pandemic restrictions subside, 
the percentage of customers shopping online is 
expected to fall 3 percentage points from 2021 
levels across key markets, including Europe, the 
US and China.66 This presents an opportunity for 
players to reshape the role of stores in their overall 
retail mix. 

Engagement with in-store technology can 

lead customers to spend up to four times longer 
shopping than customers who simply browse.67 
But what is the right mix of technologies to attract 
customers to stores, and keep them engaged when 
they arrive? 

Experiments with in-store technologies 
such as magic mirrors, connected hangers and 
interactive holograms were once touted in the 
industry as a solution to declining footfall and store 
engagement. These have largely failed to make a 
meaningful impact on in-store conversion rates 
while requiring hefty installation costs.68 Instead, 
fashion executives should direct investment 
towards in-store technologies that specifically 
address operational pain points and fit seamlessly 
into the customer journey. 

For example, 20 percent of customers are 

dissatisfied with online delivery and returns.69 
Mobile-based technologies that tailor and 
streamline the in-store experience and micro- 
fulfilment technologies that incorporate stores 
into distribution networks could help address  
these challenges. 

38

Mobile Apps for All
Brands can adapt mobile-based technology to the 
expectations of two distinct consumer profiles: 
the shopper seeking convenience and the shopper 
seeking experience. 

For the convenience-driven shopper, mobile 

apps can combine digital and physical shopping 
experiences in an efficient end-to-end journey. Fast-
fashion retailer Zara’s customer app, for example, 
allows shoppers to book fitting rooms, see available 
stock, find products on the shop floor and join a 
virtual queue to complete a purchase.70 The user 
experience of such apps needs to work seamlessly 
within the customer journey, and the technology 
can build on existing backend software, such as 
inventory management and point-of-sale software. 

Fashion executives should direct 
investment towards in-store 
technologies that specifically 
address operational pain points 
and fit seamlessly into the 
customer journey.

Meanwhile, for customers seeking 

experiences, social connections and entertainment 
from stores, mobile apps can help personalise visits. 
Nike’s House of Innovation stores in New York, 
Shanghai and Paris aim to showcase the brand’s 
storytelling. In New York, interactive AR challenges 
let customers surface animations and product 
information by scanning QR codes located on the 
shop floor.71 The in-store experience is particular-
ly attractive for luxury players whose customers 
expect brand immersion within stores. In its 
Shenzhen “social retail” store, Burberry encourages 
customers to interact on a WeChat mini-pro-
gramme, post photos and access benefits such as 
“secret items” at the in-store café.72 

These technologies also offer brands 
significant data insights into customers even if they

do not make a purchase, through scanned product 
tags or tracking items taken into fitting rooms. 
Store associates can have apps designed for them, 
so that they can use this customer data and improve 
workflow management, such as requesting stock for 
a customer to be brought to the shop floor quickly. 

How brands leverage available mobile 

technology depends on their strategic priorities. 
In the mass market, a high proportion of sales may 
already be generated through e-commerce apps. 
Here, a brand could develop an “in-store” mode to 
bolt onto an existing app. In the luxury segment, 
e-commerce apps commonly account for less than 
10 percent of sales, which means it will be more 
challenging to encourage customers to adopt 
app-based behaviours.73 

Improving Omnichannel Journeys
A customer’s in-store experience is not the only 
aspect of shopping in a physical store that can 
benefit from a digital upgrade. Leading players 
are also adopting technologies that allow stores 
to become micro-fulfilment centres. By using 

stores to fulfil online orders, brands can maintain 
appropriate stock levels across distribution and 
store networks and enable fast delivery. Conversion 
rates are around 50 percent higher with same-day 
delivery compared with two days.74 

Some mass-market players such as Target 

are repurposing space within physical store 
networks to create micro-fulfilment centres, 
helping them to adapt to quick commerce and 
ultra-fast delivery expectations. This is often 
through buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) 
models or buy online, ship from store (BOSFS), 
where the order is sent from a store where all items 
are in stock.75 However, to date, most players have 
not gone digital. Typically, keeping track of stock is 
done manually and in-store stock is not integrated 
into overall e-commerce stock. 

Stock optimisation technologies can help 
speed up and automate a store’s value chain. For 
example, fast-fashion giant Inditex uses RFID 
product tags that feed into a single inventory 
system. This gives visibility into stock levels across 
channels, allowing for online order fulfilment

from store stock. This visibility has reduced the 
time required for store associates to take a store 
inventory by 88 percent.76 

Cloud computing is an increasingly viable 

enabler of micro-fulfilment centres. By running IT 
infrastructure in the cloud, brands can centralise 
their technology capabilities and collaboration, 
and run data analytics in real time across store 
networks, regardless of where they are located.
For mass-market executives looking to 

leverage these emerging technologies, we identify 
three types of fulfilment models:
•  A back-office delivery centre, in which orders 
are fulfilled with very limited automation. 

•  A dedicated in-store floor section for 

e-commerce order fulfilment, with some degree 
of robotic automation. 

•  A “dark store,” which is a physical store 
converted entirely into a distribution or 
fulfilment hub, which could be entirely 
automated with robotics.  

The cost savings on shipping alone can be 
substantial with micro-fulfilment models. In 2019, 
Brian Cornell, chief executive of Target Corp, said 
that when one of its stores fulfils an online order, it 
costs around 40 percent less than shipping from a 
distribution centre to a customer. When customers 
order online and pick up in store, about 90 percent 
of the cost is saved.77  

But without technology that can streamline 

the fulfilment process, from order allocation to 
packing, a brand will likely need either high-value 
orders or a boutique model with low levels of

in-store traffic to justify manual in-store fulfilment. 

Therefore, automation can play an 

important role across all types of fulfilment 
models to help brands maximise cost savings. 
Brands can use stock optimisation software, 
which incorporates all stock across their store 
and distribution networks; last mile optimisation 
software, which boosts the efficiency of allocating 
order delivery routes; employee task management 
solutions; and fully robotic set-ups that include 
robotic grids and arms for picking, packing and 
storing stock.

e-commerce fulfilment and what fulfilment model 
to pursue, executives should consider the brand’s 
size, store density and e-commerce activity, as 
well as physical store locations and customer 

demand. For instance, luxury brands will probably 
not devote retail space exclusively to fulfilling 
orders because of the high costs of their stores’ 
prime locations. Instead, they will focus on stock 
optimisation algorithms to predict the best location 
from which to fulfil an order and pick and pack 
manually — something mass-market players simply 
cannot afford to do. For mass-market brands, 
automated e-commerce order fulfilment can make 
financial sense if order volume is high enough and 
in a dense, urban area — even more so if customers 
are paying a premium for faster delivery. 

However, regardless of order volume, using 

inventory optimisation software to help predict the 
number of items returned to stores is a promising 
use case given that approximately 30 to 40 percent 
of e-commerce sales are returned.

How Luxury Brands Are Using 
Technology to Enhance the 
Customer Experience

Far from replacing the personal, face-to-face service at the heart of the luxury shopping 
experience, new technologies and digital channels are giving brands engaging and creative ways 
to enhance their customer relationships.

The digital tools and touchpoints that are 

becoming part of the luxury customer 
experience, ranging from apps to 
online channels to virtual reality, are 

no substitute for personal, face-to-face service in 
physical stores. Instead, they are enabling brands 
and retailers to enhance the experience.

Around 80 percent of luxury sales are 

influenced by digital touchpoints.78 Even luxury 
fashion brands that do not sell core products 
such as clothing and leather goods online, such 
as Chanel, have websites, apps and social media 
accounts to connect with customers digitally. 
Meanwhile, brands that have historically leaned 
into new innovations are exploring emerging 
technology. For example, Gucci is using augmented 
reality (AR) for virtual try-on of sneakers and 
Burberry for uses like providing shoppers with a 
digital representation of its bags to better convey 
their shapes and sizes.79 

Stores continue to be where the 
vast majority of sales happen, 
and store associates are at the 
centre of the luxury shopping 
experience.

Still, stores continue to be where the vast 

majority of sales happen, and store associates are at 
the centre of the luxury shopping experience. Hero, 
Getbee, Kering’s Luce and other clienteling apps 
designed for in-store associates to communicate 
with and sell to customers remotely were already 
on the rise before Covid-19 arrived in 2020 and 
became vital to many brands as the pandemic 
shuttered stores. Gucci, Balenciaga, Moncler and 
Burberry, among others, turned to clienteling as 
a way to stay connected with their customers. But 
as fashion businesses enter into post-pandemic 
recovery, apps are still important for enhancing the 
customer experience.

Clienteling 2.0
When Farfetch-owned Browns opened its new 
high-tech flagship in London in April 2021, it 

leveraged technology such as apps to connect 
customers directly with “what is most important 
in the store, [and that] is the sales associate,” 
said Sandrine Deveaux, Farfetch executive vice 
president of future retail. 

Browns associates use an app that provides 

the usual clienteling features as well as what 
Deveaux called a “connected retail layer.” This layer 
allows associates to, for example, scan a QR code 
in the consumer-facing Browns app to connect to a 
shopper’s account on the store’s site. 

Associates can then pull physical items 

appearing on a shopper’s wishlist and recommend 
other relevant ones. They’re also able to send 
a list of items the shopper showed interest in 
during the in-store visit to their Browns account; 
suggest products not in the store, since only some 
of Browns’ extensive inventory is available on 
location; and provide a link so purchases can be 
made from their mobile phone.

“About 30 to 35 percent of the in-store sales 

are done from stock which is not in the store,” 
Deveaux said. “Through that in-store app, the 
sales associate is really able to tell the story of this 
product and the consumers want to buy it even if 
they haven’t tried it [on].”

Thom Browne, a Farfetch partner, is among 
those using Farfetch’s technology. Its stores, which 
include locations in the US and Europe as well as 
several in China, South Korea and Japan, tend to 
be small and have limited space for stock so its 
associates use the tool to direct shoppers to its 
more expansive online catalogue.

Telling a Product Story
Chanel has introduced elements of Farfetch’s 
technology at its Rue Cambon store in Paris and has 
been rolling it out to select locations. It is employing 
the tool not so much to sell products directly but to 
highlight the stories around them, Deveaux said. 
Chanel fitting rooms have RFID sensors that read 
tags on the items customers are trying on, allowing 
a connected mirror to show information such as 
videos and photos of items as they appeared on  
the runway.80

Meanwhile, LVMH Japan, in partnership 

43

IN-DEPTH

with investment company SoftBank, announced 
in February that it is accelerating efforts to allow 
customers at its stores to enter “virtual reality 
spaces” where they can communicate with artisans 
in real time and see manufacturing processes.81

Clienteling apps can play a role here as well, 
providing store associates with information about 
a collection which they can share with clients. In 
2021, the Hero app also introduced a feature for 
associates to create short-form videos they can use 
to highlight specific products.

Of course, these are some of the more 
advanced examples of how luxury labels are using 
technology for the customer experience. Milton 
Pedraza, chief executive of research and consulting 
firm Luxury Institute, pointed out that few brands 
have yet to use clienteling apps as effectively as 
they could. One challenge is training staff on how 
to properly communicate with customers through 
these channels, he added.

E-commerce and social media 
are increasingly where shoppers 
now encounter products, a fact 
that has altered the relationship 
between brands and retailers.

Many luxury brands are only in the early 

stages of collecting and deriving insights from 
data on customers to help them personalise their 
service across channels. Eventually, the aim would 
be to offer every shopper, or as many as possible at 
least, individualised service and communications, 
from recommending products based on their taste 
when they enter a store, to serving them the most 
relevant products when they open the brand’s app 
to sending emails letting them know when items 
they might like have arrived at a store nearby.

These efforts show how brands are 
integrating technology and digital channels into 
the way they serve shoppers even in physical spaces.

LVMH Japan noted in its announcement 

that it is adapting “to an evolving environment 
which includes the expansion of online sales, 

44

remote clienteling and support for a diversity 
of interests among new and younger customer 
segments.” Burberry’s “social retail” store in 
Shenzhen, which it created with Chinese tech 
giant Tencent, lets shoppers unlock content and 
experiences through a mini-programme in WeChat, 
the Tencent super app used widely in the country 
for messaging, payments and more.82

Digital Past and Present
Luxury’s growing acknowledgement of the 
importance of digital channels is in sharp contrast 
to how much of the industry reacted in the early 
days of the internet and online shopping.

“You had to paint a picture of what the 

customer experience would be like,” Natalie 
Massenet, who founded pioneering luxury 
e-commerce retailer Net-a-Porter in 2000, said of 
the challenge she faced convincing brands to sell 
online. It was hard for brands to believe customers 
would want to buy a product without having 
touched it. “I always used to explain to brands that 
that they were underestimating the fact that people 
were coming to make a purchase in their store 
already having decided to make a purchase, because 
they would’ve seen the products they wanted in 
fashion magazines,” she added.

E-commerce and social media are 

increasingly where shoppers now encounter 
products, a fact that has altered the relationship 
between brands and retailers. Massenet noted 
that “wholesale distribution today is very much 
seen as a marketing function, because brands 
have the opportunity to go direct to consumers.” 
Many luxury brands that do sell online are 
shifting to an e-concession model, where they 
manage the presentation and stock available 
through a retail partner, or they are cutting back 
on wholesale. Kering recently said it would cease 
online wholesale entirely.83 While there are several 
reasons for these moves, such as better margins and 
control of inventory, a key motivation for brands 
is having a greater hold over the customer journey, 
before and after purchase.  
Fashion businesses look set to continue to develop 
ways to blend digital and physical. In April,

Farfetch and Neiman Marcus Group struck a deal 
that will see Bergdorf Goodman’s website and 
mobile app moved to Farfetch’s backend technology 
platform. The companies said in a statement that 
Bergdorf Goodman’s digital customer experience 
will be offered to shoppers globally and integrated 
seamlessly with its New York City flagship.84 
Luxury brands also see a clear role for 

technology for connecting with customers beyond 
physical stores. The forays into virtual worlds and 
NFTs by several luxury players also illustrate the 
value they place on extending their brands online. 
Brands have also begun exploring how they can 
use technology to make customised items through 
small-batch production, ultimately helping their 
products become as personal as their service.

END-TO-END 
UPGRADE

Digital tools and analytics have transformed key parts of the 
fashion value chain, but these optimisations are often siloed 
within organisations, limiting the potential for cross-functional 
improvements. Brands should embark on end-to-end value  
chain integration to create more efficient and more  
profitable ways of operating. 

46

KEY INSIGHTS

•  More than 60 percent of fashion executives believe creating integrated digital processes 
throughout their organisations will be among their top-five areas for digitisation as they 
look ahead to 2025.

•  There are very few off-the-shelf solutions that are designed to integrate the fashion 

value chain from end to end, meaning companies will need to build custom solutions or 
prioritise pain points.

•  By adopting integrated, digitally enabled value chain solutions, brands could see up to a 
50 percent increase in speed to market, up to 8 percent rise in full-price sell through and 
up to a 20 percent decline in manufacturing costs.

TECH ENABLERS

•  Artificial intelligence and machine learning models to predict, execute or 

suggest business decisions along the value chain.

•  Big Data to provide a data backbone or “common truth” across an organisation, to 

which other technologies are connected. 

•  Cloud computing to deliver the computing power that enables applications and 

data platforms to be scalable, cost effective and high performing.

•  Digital workflows to simplify, standardise and automate internal processes.

04. END-TO-END UPGRADE

Fast-changing consumer demand and 
persistent supply chain disruptions are just a few of 
the factors adding to the complexity of operating a 
fashion brand today. 

The industry needs a new digitised value 

chain model that unites multiple internal processes 
and data sources, from demand forecasting to 
pricing. Indeed, when it comes to digitisation, 61 
percent of fashion executives believe end-to-end 
process management is among the most important 
investment areas for their organisations between 
2021 and 2025.85 The result will be more fortified, 
shock-resistant companies which are able to 
navigate today’s volatile business landscape. 

One reason is that relatively few off-the-
shelf applications are designed to optimise the 
fashion value chain from end to end. While 
companies like Nextail,86 Logility87 and O988 offer 
solutions that address certain activities such as 
buying, first product allocation, replenishment 
and store transfers, no single solution covers the 
entire value chain. Brands thus need to identify 
solutions that address their pain points or custom 
build applications, which is resource intensive. At 
the same time, development costs remain high and 
companies face gaps in their technology stacks and 
talent pools.

Product performance, or assessment 

of which products are selling well — shows the 
impact of end-to-end integration in practice. A 
siloed pricing and promotions application might 
use AI and machine learning to determine a 
product’s promotional price by analysing the 
current stock, in-season price, time in season 
and expected elasticity. By contrast, investing in 
end-to-end integration would expand the scope of 
the application to also consider similar products 
already in store or arriving soon, as well as 
expected returns or a competition range. Each of 
these data points impact expected sell-through and 

thus the appropriate promotional pricing, which 
can ultimately boost gross margins.

At Levi’s, company-wide machine learning 

combined with a cloud-based data repository 
containing internal and external sales and 
inventory information provide multiple processes 
with resources to make better decisions around 
everything from pricing to consumer marketing, 
according to chief strategy and AI officer, Katia 
Walsh. Data-driven knowledge-sharing also 
helps Levi’s determine the best locations from 
which to ship its products, identifying the store 
or distribution centre that is the closest to the 
shipping address, helping it to control logistics costs 
and manage store inventory smoothly.90

 Shein takes this even further. Not only has 
the ultra-fast fashion player integrated its internal 
processes, but it has also linked those internal 
processes with that of its suppliers. This enables 
a fast and efficient ordering and replenishment 
journey. Shein uses AI modelling to evaluate 
millions of social media posts across platforms 
to determine which products to produce, while 
advanced analytics help its design teams review

the performance of design attributes down to 
details like the zipper and fabric. With its vertically 
integrated supply chain using software from 
Singbada,91 Shein’s designs could reach customers 
within approximately three weeks after they are 
first conceived.92

Executives should be prepared 
to address potential resistance to 
working in a more connected way, 
one in which data, and knowledge, 
flow across processes seamlessly.

To be sure, fashion players’ operating 
models will continue to require a finely tuned 
balance of art and science to not lose sight of the 
creative, experience-focused aspects of decision-
making which are critical in fashion. Executives 

should be prepared to address potential resistance 
to working in a more connected way, one in 
which data, and knowledge, flow across processes 
seamlessly. Embracing deep digital integration will 
require focusing on change management. Teams 
will need to be upskilled or reskilled, and tools will 
need to be designed with a user-centric mindset to 
ensure their adoption. For example, this may mean 
adopting “explainable AI” whereby AI predictions 
and outputs can be easily understood and managed 
by humans, unlike “black-box” models that are 
difficult to interpret, and therefore trust.

Ultimately, fashion companies — from 

mass market to luxury alike — will benefit from 
optimising their time to market, flexibility 
and product availability at a time when many 
companies are struggling to maintain margins. 
Value chain integration will prove to be a critical 
point of competitive differentiation.

Traceability systems powered by tracking software and Big 
Data will help fashion brands focusing on sustainability reach 
far into their supply chains to understand the entire lifecycle 
of their products.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  More than 50 percent of fashion decision makers say traceability will be a top-five 

enabler to reduce emissions in their supply chains, but many brands at best currently 
only have visibility over their suppliers with whom they have direct relationships.

•  Creating a centralised system for sustainability metric calculations, data collection and 
supply chain traceability is essential to make meaningful progress against social and 
environmental goals.

•  To accelerate advancements in traceability, fashion companies should invest in emerging 

technologies like digital ledgers, be willing to open source their own solutions, and 
collaborate with start-ups and industry peers.

TECH ENABLERS

•  Big Data to process large, complex supply chain-related data sets with AI and machine

05. TRACEABILITY FIRST

More than ever, fashion brands are being 

held accountable for their environmental and social 
impact. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions alone, 
it is estimated that the industry is accountable for 
2.1 billion tonnes (or 4 percent of the global total), a 
figure that it set to rise if action is not taken.93 

Brands are largely ill-equipped to monitor 

and manage social and environmental practices 
across their supply chains, including greenhouse 
gas emissions, of which only 6 percent on average 
is generated from their direct operations. Fashion 
players are operating with very limited visibility of 
their supply chain beyond their tier one suppliers 
with whom they have direct relationships.94 

Now, new legislation and the increased 

• 

frequency of supply chain disruptions, alongside 
consumer and investor pressure, are forcing 
corporate action. 

If fashion brands are to achieve 
sustainability objectives, ranging from better 
materials sourcing to improved regulatory 
compliance to emissions reduction, they will need 
to establish full line of sight into how their products 
are manufactured. 

Currently, the industry’s traceability 
efforts are hampered by manual 
processes and unreliable data.

Complete traceability entails brands 
identifying the history, location and distribution of 
product parts and materials throughout all stages 
of the supply chain — including contractors and 
subcontractors. More than 50 percent of fashion 
decision makers say traceability will be a top-five 
enabler to reduce emissions in their supply chain 
before 2025.95 This visibility provides stakeholders 
with information that can inform sustainability-
related decisions:96 97  

•  Regulatory compliance: Traceability plays a 
critical role in helping companies proactively 

54

respond to the fast-evolving regulatory 
landscape, including in the US, where the 
Securities and Exchange Commission has 
proposed its Enhancement and Standardization 
of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors. 
This new rule will require US-listed companies 
to disclose emissions from tiers one, two and 
three of their supply chains. Also on the horizon 
is the EU’s proposed legislation as part of its 
Green Deal that will set mandatory minimum 
levels for recycled content in products and 
will require digital twins for products that 
contain sustainability information to combat 
misleading marketing, or “greenwashing.”98 99  
Investors and the ESG imperative: Similarly, 
companies need a greater grip on traceability to 
demonstrate to the financial community how 
they are meeting investment criteria relating 
to environmental, social and governance 
targets.100 

•  Customer expectations: Finally, customers 

are increasingly calling on brands to be 
better equipped to assess and disclose their 
sustainability claims. In China, 25 percent of 
customers rank sustainability as one of the 
top three factors that they considered when 
purchasing luxury products.101 In Europe, 60 
percent of fashion customers say transparency 
is important. While just 20 percent currently 
seek out this information when purchasing, the 
percentage of customers who are acting on these 
interests is starting to increase — particularly 
among younger generations.102

Currently, the industry’s traceability efforts are 
hampered by manual processes and unreliable data. 
This is exacerbated by the lack of industry-wide 
standards, leaving both brands and their suppliers 
to struggle with tracking and aggregating data. 

For traceability to operate successfully at 
scale, a common data language is essential. This 
will create the level of standardisation required 
for comparability and allow manufacturers and 

The State of Fashion: Technology 
suppliers to share data more easily with multiple 
brands, encouraging a higher level of buy-in across 
the value chain. To achieve a common language, 
brands will need to collaborate, both in terms of 
the types of data collected and the way in which 
key metrics like water usage and emissions are 
compiled and assigned on a product level.

The industry is showing promising 
initial signs of moving closer to this objective of 
great collaboration. Companies such as Kering, 
LVMH, Fast Retailing and Inditex have adopted 
the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures to align on how they assess and disclose 
climate risks and opportunities.103 Some initiatives 
offer certification labels (such as Cradle to Cradle)104 
or self-assessment tools (like the Higg Index,105 
developed by the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, an 

industry-wide non-profit).106 

There are concerns, voiced by players 

such as the Changing Markets Foundation, that 
the fragmented nature of these schemes makes 
comparability and a holistic and granular view 
of impact difficult.107 As industry-wide labelling 
standards emerge (along with mechanisms to 
validate the data), consolidation of traceability and 
impact tracking standards will likely occur and 
will be an important enabler for the acceleration of 
traceability efforts given the network effects of  
such solutions. 

The Power of Data
Technology will be critical for the development 
and adoption of a common data language. Given 
the complexity and fragmentation of value

a decentralised ledger (a peer-to-peer shared 
database with no central administrator) to 
efficiently collect and distribute data and ensure 
its reliability — the data within digital ledgers is 
immutable. These ledgers may be open source or 
owned by individual brands, or third-parties and 
start-ups could create data interfaces for specific 
segments of the value chain. 

Such traceability systems — whereby each 
entity along the value chain inputs data — are far 
from a reality today. However, pilots are running 
to test platforms that enable brands to track 
garments through the supply chain, alongside 
implementations of off-the-shelf solutions 
connecting suppliers and brands’ data systems. For 
example, TextileGenesis, which uses blockchain-
based technology to assign a trackable digital token 
to recycled and organic fibres, has partnered with 
Fashion for Good, Lenzing and other organisations 
as well as retailers such as Bestseller, Kering, 
Zalando and H&M Group to use the technology to 
validate whether fibres originate from  

56

sustainable sources.108

Meanwhile, TrusTrace offers a centralised 

database of certifications and other evidence to 
document the sustainability claims from retailers, 
manufacturers and suppliers, as well as third 
parties such as certification agencies. Adidas, which 
has targets to use only recycled polyester by 2024 
and to make 90 percent of its products in a way that 
is more sustainable by 2025, will use TrusTrace’s 
software to track all certified materials used in its 
products in the next two years.109 

Owing to the complex and 
fragmented nature of the value 
chain, technology is the key 
enabler to achieving traceability.

In addition, companies such as Applied 
DNA Sciences are experimenting with physical 
(for example, RFID) and molecular trackers 
that can be applied to products at various 
stages of manufacturing and can store product 
information.110 Thread manufacturer American 
& Efird has adopted molecular trackers to

authenticate some lines of recycled thread.111 
However, just 10 percent of senior fashion 
executives have invested in such physical “track 
and trace” solutions when seeking to address supply 
chain visibility and traceability.112

Knowledge Sharing
For traceability initiatives to have a meaningful 
impact, brands will need to be more open about 
proprietary knowledge about their supply chains. 
Collaboration is required to achieve a common 
good. This is happening in some parts of the 
industry. The Aura Blockchain Consortium has 
united LVMH, Prada and Richemont-owned 
Cartier on a shared platform to solve traceability 
challenges by developing blockchain-based 
“product passports” for luxury goods.113 This 
would provide verified information relating to 
a product’s entire lifecycle. In addition, H&M 
Group has launched an open-source B2B service 
called Treadler to grant industry peers access to 
its suppliers list. H&M vets suppliers using Higg 
data and shares information as a paid-for service to 
allow other brands to engage with H&M-vetted 

suppliers without having to conduct their  
own assessment.114

The onus will be on big brands with the 
capital to invest — and, ultimately, the biggest 
footprints — to lead the charge. It is likely that over 
time a handful of data platforms will emerge as 
principal solutions, so there is a potential return on 
investment for brands who can help develop them. 
Traceability will put the industry on 

track towards a more transparent, accountable 
future, ensuring that investors, consumers and 
regulators can interact with brands based on 
sustainability information they can trust. What’s 
more, traceability will be critical in establishing 
a competitive business model. Owing to the 
complex and fragmented nature of the value 
chain, technology is the key enabler to achieving 
traceability. With this, brands need to embrace a 
new, collaborative mindset to enable information 
sharing, while extending tools and providing 
training and support to their suppliers so that they 
are also able to embrace a more traceable industry.

items created with technology and 3D 
software to be applied, for example, 
to social media images or to alter the 
appearance of avatars in games.

Virtual goods
Intangible objects traded in online 
communities or marketplaces, to be 
used either in virtual worlds or as 
collectibles.

Virtual sampling
A digitised, three-dimensional 
product development process, 
enabling designers to create virtual 
samples simulating movement, 
stretch and use.

Web3
The next phase of the internet using 
a decentralised, peer-to-peer model 
powered by blockchain technology 
on which apps and platforms would 
be built. 

GLOSSARY

Avatar
A digital image or graphic 
representation of a real person used 
in virtual worlds such as computer 
games or social media.

Category performance
Measures the performance metrics 
of a product category – e.g. units sold, 
revenue, full-price sell through. 

Clienteling apps
Apps used by store associates to guide 
consumers through their in-store 
shopping journey. These apps can 
enable associates to, for example, 
access customer loyalty data and 
inventory information or act as a 
point of sale.

Cryptocurrency
(e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana) 
A type of digital asset built on the 
blockchain that represents encrypted 
currency, which can help prevent 
counterfeiting, among other uses. 
It can be “mined” (created) or 
purchased from special exchanges. 
No official authority or government 
produces, monitors or regulates 
cryptocurrency.
