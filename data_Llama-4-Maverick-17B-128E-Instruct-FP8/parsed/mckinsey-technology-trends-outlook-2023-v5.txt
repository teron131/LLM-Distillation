Introduction

After a tumultuous 2022 for technology investment and 
talent, the first half of 2023 has seen a resurgence of 
enthusiasm about technology’s potential to catalyze 
progress in business and society. Generative AI deserves 
much of the credit for ushering in this revival, but it 
stands as just one of many advances on the horizon 
that could drive sustainable, inclusive growth and solve 
complex global challenges. 

To help executives track the latest developments, the 
McKinsey Technology Council has once again identified 
and interpreted the most significant technology trends 
unfolding today. While many trends are in the early 
stages of adoption and scale, executives can use this 
research to plan ahead by developing an understanding 
of potential use cases and pinpointing the critical skills 
needed as they hire or upskill talent to bring these 
opportunities to fruition. 

Our analysis examines quantitative measures of 
interest, innovation, and investment to gauge the 
momentum of each trend. Recognizing the long-term 
nature and interdependence of these trends, we also 
delve into underlying technologies, uncertainties, and 
questions surrounding each trend. This year, we added 
an important new dimension for analysis—talent. We 
provide data on talent supply-and-demand dynamics 
for the roles of most relevance to each trend. (For more, 
please see the sidebar, “Research methodology,”  
on page 9.)

New and notable

All of last year’s 14 trends remain on our list, though some 
experienced accelerating momentum and investment, 
while others saw a downshift. One new trend, generative 
AI, made a loud entrance and has already shown 
potential for transformative business impact.

This new entrant represents the next frontier of AI. 
Building upon existing technologies such as applied 
AI and industrializing machine learning, generative 
AI has high potential and applicability across most 
industries. Interest in the topic (as gauged by news and 
internet searches) increased threefold from 2021 to 
2022. As we recently wrote, generative AI and other 
foundational models change the AI game by taking 
assistive technology to a new level, reducing application 
development time, and bringing powerful capabilities 
to nontechnical users. Generative AI is poised to add 
as much as $4.4 trillion in economic value from a 
combination of specific use cases and more diffuse 
uses—such as assisting with email drafts—that increase 
productivity. Still, while generative AI can unlock 
significant value, firms should not underestimate the 
economic significance and the growth potential that 
underlying AI technologies and industrializing machine 
learning can bring to various industries.

About the McKinsey Technology Council

Investment in most tech trends tightened 
year over year, but the potential for future 
growth remains high, as further indicated by 
the recent rebound in tech valuations. Indeed, 
absolute investments remained strong in 
global job postings 
2022, at more than $1 trillion combined, 
from 2021 to 2022
indicating great faith in the value potential of 
these trends. Trust architectures and digital 
identity grew the most out of last year’s 14 
trends, increasing by nearly 50 percent as 
security, privacy, and resilience become 
increasingly critical across industries. 
Investment in other trends—such as applied 
AI, advanced connectivity, and cloud and 
edge computing—declined, but that is likely 
due, at least in part, to their maturity. More 
mature technologies can be more sensitive 
to short-term budget dynamics than more 
nascent technologies with longer investment 
time horizons, such as climate and mobility 
technologies. Also, as some technologies 
become more profitable, they can often scale 
further with lower marginal investment. Given 
that these technologies have applications 
in most industries, we have little doubt that 
mainstream adoption will continue to grow. 

Organizations shouldn’t focus too heavily 
on the trends that are garnering the most 
attention. By focusing on only the most hyped 
trends, they may miss out on the significant 
value potential of other technologies and 
hinder the chance for purposeful capability 
building. Instead, companies seeking 
longer-term growth should focus on a 
portfolio-oriented investment across the 
tech trends most important to their business. 
Technologies such as cloud and edge 
computing and the future of bioengineering 
have shown steady increases in innovation 
and continue to have expanded use cases 
across industries. In fact, more than 400 edge 
use cases across various industries have been 
identified, and edge computing is projected to 
win double-digit growth globally over the next 
five years. Additionally, nascent technologies, 
such as quantum, continue to evolve and 
show significant potential for value creation. 
Our updated analysis for 2023 shows that 
the four industries likely to see the earliest 
economic impact from quantum computing—

automotive, chemicals, financial services, and 
life sciences—stand to potentially gain up 
to $1.3 trillion in value by 2035. By carefully 
assessing the evolving landscape and 
considering a balanced approach, businesses 
can capitalize on both established and 
emerging technologies to propel innovation 
and achieve sustainable growth.

Tech talent dynamics

We can’t overstate the importance of 
talent as a key source in developing a 
competitive edge. A lack of talent is a top 
issue constraining growth. There’s a wide gap 
between the demand for people with the skills 
needed to capture value from the tech trends 
and available talent: our survey of 3.5 million 
job postings in these tech trends found that 
many of the skills in greatest demand have 
less than half as many qualified practitioners 
per posting as the global average. Companies 
should be on top of the talent market, ready 
to respond to notable shifts and to deliver a 
strong value proposition to the technologists 
they hope to hire and retain. For instance, 
recent layoffs in the tech sector may present 
a silver lining for other industries that have 
struggled to win the attention of attractive 
candidates and retain senior tech talent. 
In addition, some of these technologies 
will accelerate the pace of workforce 
transformation. In the coming decade, 20 to 
30 percent of the time that workers spend on 
the job could be transformed by automation 
technologies, leading to significant shifts 
in the skills required to be successful.  And 
companies should continue to look at how 
they can adjust roles or upskill individuals 
to meet their tailored job requirements. Job 
postings in fields related to tech trends grew 
at a very healthy 15 percent between 2021 and 
2022, even though global job postings overall 
decreased by 13 percent. Applied AI and next-
generation software development together 
posted nearly one million jobs between 
2018 and 2022. Next-generation software 
development saw the most significant growth 
in number of jobs (Exhibit 1).

This bright outlook for practitioners in most fields 
highlights the challenge facing employers who are 
struggling to find enough talent to keep up with their 
demands. The shortage of qualified talent has been a 
persistent limiting factor in the growth of many high-
tech fields, including AI, quantum technologies, space 
technologies, and electrification and renewables.  

The talent crunch is particularly pronounced for trends 
such as cloud computing and industrializing machine 
learning, which are required across most industries. 
It’s also a major challenge in areas that employ highly 
specialized professionals, such as the future of mobility 
and quantum computing (Exhibit 2).

 The 15 tech trends

This report lays out considerations for all 15 technology  
trends. We grouped them into five broader categories  
to make it easier to consider related trends: the AI 
revolution, building the digital future, cutting-edge 
engineering, compute and connectivity frontiers, and a 
sustainable world. Of course, when considering trend 

combinations, there’s significant power and potential in 
looking across these groupings.

To describe the state of each trend, we developed 
scores for innovation (based on patents and research) 
and interest (based on news and web searches). We also 
counted investments in relevant technologies and rated 
their level of adoption by organizations (Exhibit 3).

To assess the development of each technology trend, our team collected data on five tangible 
measures of activity: search engine queries, news publications, patents, research publications, 
and investment. For each measure, we used a defined set of data sources to find occurrences of 
keywords associated with each of the 15 trends, screened those occurrences for valid mentions 
of activity, and indexed the resulting numbers of mentions on a 0–1 scoring scale that is relative 
to the trends studied. The innovation score combines the patents and research scores; the 
interest score combines the news and search scores. (While we recognize that an interest 
score can be inflated by deliberate efforts to stimulate news and search activity, we believe that 
each score fairly reflects the extent of discussion and debate about a given trend.) Investment 
measures the flows of funding from the capital markets into companies linked with the trend. 
Data sources for the scores include the following:

 — Patents. Data on patent filings are sourced from Google Patents.

 — Research. Data on research publications are sourced from the Lens (www.lens.org).

 — News. Data on news publications are sourced from Factiva.

 — Searches. Data on search engine queries are sourced from Google Trends.

 — Investment. Data on private-market and public-market capital raises are sourced  

from PitchBook.

 — Talent demand. Number of job postings is sourced from McKinsey’s proprietary 

Organizational Data Platform, which stores licensed, de-identified data on professional 
profiles and job postings. Data is drawn primarily from English-speaking countries.

In addition, we updated the selection and definition of trends from last year’s study to reflect the 
evolution of technology trends:

 — The generative-AI trend was added since last year’s study.

 — We adjusted the definitions of electrification and renewables (previously called future of 

clean energy) and climate technologies beyond electrification and renewables (previously 
called future of sustainable consumption).

 — Data sources were updated. This year, we included only closed deals in PitchBook  
data, which revised downward the investment numbers for 2018–22. For future of  
space technologies investments, we used research from McKinsey’s Aerospace &  
Defense Practice.

Applied AI

The trend—and why it matters

With AI capabilities, such as machine learning (ML), 
computer vision, and natural-language processing (NLP), 
companies in all industries can use data and derive insights 
to automate processes, add or augment capabilities, and 
make better decisions. McKinsey research estimates the 
potential economic value at stake from applied AI to be  
$17 trillion to $26 trillion, and the share of companies 
pursuing that value has been increasing. The annual 

McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI shows that the 
proportion of responding organizations adopting AI more 
than doubled from 20 percent in 2017 to 50 percent in 2022. 
The 2022 survey also indicated that adopting AI can have 
significant financial benefits: 25 percent of respondents 
attributed 5 percent or more of their companies’ EBIT to AI. 
However, organizational, technical, ethical, and regulatory 
issues should be resolved before businesses can realize the 
technology’s full potential.

Applied AI
Scoring the trend
High innovation and investment scores for 
applied AI are commensurate with its large 
potential impact. Each year from 2018 to 2022, 
applied AI has had the highest innovation scores 
of all the trends we studied, and its investment 
score also ranks in the top five. Perhaps 
unsurprisingly, in 2022, demand for talent in 
applied AI was also highest among all trends.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving applied AI:

 — Investment fuels enhanced AI capabilities. Although 
investments in AI were down to $104 billion in 2022  
from a high of $146.8 billion in 2021, they continue to 
pace ahead of 2018–20 levels, which averaged  
$73.5 billion. With investments flowing, AI continues 
to post state-of-the-art results with continuous 
improvements in areas such as model accuracy. For 
example, the cost to train image classification systems 
has decreased by 63.6 percent, and training times 
have improved by 94.4 percent since 2018.1 However, 
additional potential for applied AI could be unlocked 
by combining it with new emerging AI technology. For 
example, the foundation models underlying generative 
AI could process large amounts of unstructured 
manufacturing data, such as notes and logs, to enrich 
current AI solutions that optimize performance.

 — Policy makers accelerate regulatory actions to curb 
AI misuse. As AI technology advances, so too has its 
potential for misuse: the AIAAIC Repository, which 
tracks incidents related to the ethical misuse of AI, 
algorithms, and automation, indicates that the number 
of controversies involving AI has increased by 26 times 
since 2012. Algorithmic fairness, bias, and misuse have 
become mainstream concerns. An analysis of legislative 
records in 127 countries shows that the number of laws 
passed containing the words “artificial intelligence” 
grew from one in 2016 to 37 in 2022. Prompted by the 
accelerated development of AI by private firms, the 
European Union’s AI Act—which regulates foundational 
AI models—is nearing law status following parliamentary 
committee approval. Meanwhile, the McKinsey Global 
Survey on the state of AI indicates that there has been 
no substantial increase in organizations’ reported 
mitigation of AI-related risks relative to the increase  
in AI use.

 — Global AI adoption plateaus—for now. While AI adoption 
globally is more than double that in 2017, the proportion 
of organizations using AI has leveled off to around 
50 percent to 60 percent in recent years. However, 
companies that have already adopted AI nearly doubled 
the number of capabilities they use, such as natural-
language generation or computer vision, from 1.9 in 2018 
to 3.8 in 2022.2 

‘We haven’t found an industry  
or business function that couldn’t 
enhance its performance through 
applying AI. But capturing the 
value of AI is a journey that 
requires taking action across 
multiple dimensions, from  
talent to technology.’

‘Applied AI has the potential to become more valuable and 
useful to companies in combination with generative AI. A key 
marker for the future will be how synergies between the two  
are captured to maximize value capture across organizations.’ 

– Carlo Giovine, partner, London 

In real life 

Key uncertainties 

Real-world examples involving the use of applied AI 
include the following:

The major uncertainties affecting applied AI include  
the following:

 — Emirates Team New Zealand dramatically accelerated 

hydrofoil design and testing by using AI to train a “digital 
twin”—a digital replica of a sailor—to test designs in 
a simulated environment. By using the AI “sailor” to 
remove the bottleneck of human sailors performing the 
tests, the team reduced costs by 95 percent and was 
able to test ten times as many designs.

 — Freeport-McMoRan deployed a custom-built AI model 
loaded with three years’ worth of operating data to 
optimize production processes and total output at a 
copper mill. In doing so, it increased production by 
10 percent while reducing capital expenditures on a 
planned expansion. 

 — Telkomsel built a new data analytics platform 

supplemented by AI-driven tools to better understand 
customers across thousands of microsegments. Using 
9,000 data points per customer across more than 
50 models, the company drives personalization by 
identifying the right way to interact with customers and 
offering the most relevant products and services.

Underlying technologies

AI comprises several technologies that perform cognitive-
like tasks. These include the following:

 — Machine learning (ML). This term refers to models that 
make predictions after being trained with data rather 
than following programmed rules. 

 — Computer vision. This type of ML works with visual 
data, such as images, videos, and 3-D signals.

 — Natural-language processing (NLP). This type of ML 

analyzes and generates language-based data, such as 
text and speech.

 — Deep reinforcement learning. This type of ML uses 

artificial neural networks and training through trial and 
error to make predictions.

 — Lack of available resources, such as talent and funding, 
might affect the pipeline of AI applications, despite 
technical advances in solutions for industrializing ML 
and in IT infrastructure.

 — Cybersecurity and privacy concerns, notably on data 
risks and vulnerabilities, are prevalent—51 percent of 
survey respondents cited cybersecurity as a leading 
risk in 2022.

 — Regulation and compliance might affect AI research 

and applications.

 — Ethical considerations—including data governance, 
equity, fairness, and “explainability”—surround the 
responsible and trustworthy use of AI.

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with applied AI:

 — How might companies better determine which  

AI applications benefit them and their  
stakeholders most?

 — What features make AI trustworthy and responsible 
and how should they be integrated into applications?

 — What checks should companies put in place to guard 
against AI-related risks associated with data privacy 
and security, equity, fairness, and compliance?

 — How will companies use generative AI in combination 
with applied AI to maximize potential synergies or 
differentiate when it makes sense to use one approach 
over the other?

Industrializing machine learning

The trend—and why it matters

Industrializing machine learning (ML), commonly referred 
to as ML operations, or MLOps, refers to the engineering 
practices needed to scale and sustain ML applications in 
an enterprise. These practices are enabled and supported 
by an ecosystem of technical tools that is rapidly improving, 
both in functionality and interoperability. MLOps tools can 
help companies transition from pilot projects to viable 
business products, accelerate the scale-up of analytics 

solutions, identify and resolve issues in production, and 
improve teams’ productivity. Experience suggests that 
organizations that industrialize ML successfully can shorten 
the production time frame for ML applications (from proof of 
concept to product) by about eight to ten times and reduce 
development resources by up to 40 percent.3 Industrialized 
ML was pioneered by a small number of leading companies, 
but adoption is now spreading as more companies use AI for 
a wider range of applications.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving 
industrializing ML:

 — Companies increasingly commit to industrializing ML. 
Investments into companies in the ML industrialization 
space reached a high of $4.7 billion in 2021 and 
remained strong throughout 2022 at a cumulative  
$3.4 billion. With investments flowing, ML decision 
makers have also doubled down on their commitments: 
85 percent of respondents to a ClearML survey 
indicated that they had a dedicated MLOps budget in 
2022. IDC predicts that 60 percent of enterprises will 
have implemented MLOps by 2024. Such investments 
could prove wise, as our own research finds that 
companies seeing higher returns from AI are more  
likely to engage in ML industrialization.

 — The ecosystem rapidly evolves through acquisitions and 
new offerings. The year 2022 was marked by significant 
consolidation, partnerships, and new releases. Altair 
acquired RapidMiner, Snowflake acquired Myst AI, 
McKinsey acquired Iguazio, and Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise acquired Pachyderm. Databricks announced 
MLflow 2.0, the successor to its highly popular open-
source MLOps framework. Additionally, Gantry released 
a new type of MLOps offering—a platform that will 
determine real-time ML-model-production performance 
and how to optimize it. With continued investment, the 
landscape is bound to change quickly.

‘We are at an inflection point 
with artificial intelligence. 
Generative AI has captured 
both mainstream and business 
imaginations. Organizations 
that are willing to continuously 
learn and adapt their processes, 
ways of working, and technology 
to industrialize ML will succeed 
in building the muscle needed  
to leverage AI at scale and 
unlock its value.’

dollars of run rate impact each year. MLOps practices 
were essential to enabling the pace and sustainability of 
this transformation.

 — A global oil and gas company integrated MLOps into the 
heart of the company’s AI/ML capabilities, reducing the 
time to build and deploy ML solutions by over 50 percent 
and realizing more than $250 million in annualized 
impact from AI-driven operations optimizations.

 — Vistra partnered with McKinsey to develop more than 
400 AI models and used MLOps to standardize their 
deployment and maintenance. This enabled the company 
to optimize the thermal efficiency across 26 of its plants, 
generate more than $20 million in energy savings, and 
abate about 1.6 million tons of carbon per year.

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with industrializing ML:

 — Up-front investment and resources will be required to 

establish industrialized ML in organizations.

 — Processes and accountability will be crucial for 
maintaining ML solutions at industrial scale.

 — A fast-evolving market will require organizations to  
avoid vendor lock-in so they can realize value from 
newer offerings provided by players outside their 
existing vendor ecosystem.

 — Potential for misaligned capabilities will need to be 

avoided by ensuring that organizations are investing at 
the right level and in the right solutions for their specific 
use case needs. 

 — With the proliferation of new technologies in ML, how 
should organizations select the ones along the ML 
workflow that are most relevant to their needs?

 — How will industrialized ML change organizations, their 

operating models, and their engineering roles? 

 — How can organizations define roles of accountability to 
ensure the trustworthy and responsible use of AI/ML as

Generative AI

The trend—and why it matters

Generative AI marks a tipping point for AI. Unlike previous 
AI, it can enable the creation of new, unstructured content—
such as text, audio, video, images, code, simulations, and 
even protein sequences or consumer journeys—based on 
information it learns from similar formats of unstructured 
data. And the technology at its core, foundational models, 
can be adapted to a wide range of tasks—for example, 
summarization, classification, and drafting. In contrast, 
previous generations of AI models were often “narrow,” 
meaning they could perform just one task. 

In a business context, generative AI could not only unlock 
novel use cases but also speed up, scale, or otherwise 
improve existing ones. Generative AI has the potential 
to redefine businesses and value chains by enabling the 

development of new products and revenue streams, 
enhancing customer experience. Its impact is expected 
to materialize most, however, in improving employee 
productivity and experience.

In these early days, we see companies in many industries 
using generative AI primarily as an assistive technology to 
create first drafts, generate hypotheses, or assist experts 
in performing a task faster or better. All of these uses have 
two things in common: there is an expert in the loop to check 
the output, especially for hallucinations (inaccurate content 
produced by the application) and intellectual-property (IP) 
issues, and they are used in an existing workflow, which 
eases adoption and change management. It might be some 
time before organizations advance generative-AI-based 
applications from assistive to fully automated for high-
stakes use cases.

Generative AI
Scoring the trend

Although generative AI ranked compara-
tively low on interest, investment, and 
innovation in 2022, the threefold increase in 
number of searches reflects a strong sense 
of excitement about the trend, and we 
anticipate significant growth across metrics 
in 2023.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving  
generative AI:

 — Global excitement about the trend paves the way for 
corporate pilots. Generative AI has witnessed a flurry 
of investment activity. For example, venture capital 
investments increased 425 percent from 2020, and 
Microsoft invested $10 billion in a multiyear deal with 
OpenAI. With nearly 80 percent of current AI research 
focused on generative AI, it should come as no surprise 
that companies in industries ranging from financial 
services to life sciences have begun experimenting 
with enterprise use cases. We also see that a range 
of start-ups have successfully developed their own 
models—for example, Cohere, Anthropic, and AI21 Labs, 
among others, build and train their own large-language 
models (LLMs). Additionally, other players in the field, 
such as Cohere, have been able to provide a higher level 
of IP protection, consumer privacy, and lower cost for 
LLMs that larger companies may want to have in their 
environments. Many others are building on top of LLM 
platforms provided by others or are extending open-
source models. Alongside these start-ups, tech giants 
like Google are also making significant strides. In May 
2023, Google announced several new generative-AI-
powered features, including the Search Generative 
Experience and a new LLM called PaLM 2, which will 
power its Bard chatbot, among other Google products. 

Further, we saw significant investments by software 
providers like Salesforce to integrate generative-AI 
capabilities into their existing products.

 — GPT-4 demonstrates a significant advancement over its 
predecessors. The widely anticipated release of GPT-4 
heralds increased functionality and performance over 
previously available models, such as improved scores 
across more than 30 academic and professional exams. 
Whereas GPT-3 performed in the bottom 10 percent of 
bar exam takers, GPT-4 performed in the top 10 percent. 
In addition, GPT-4 can now use both images and text 
as inputs, process up to 25,000 words (versus 4,000 
with GPT-3), and is 40 percent more likely to generate 
accurate responses. Several complex applications have 
been enabled, such as the use of multimodal inputs (for 
example, text and images) and the orchestration of a 
sequence of actions to complete tasks such as devising 
new recipes (for example, through applications such as 
AutoGPT and BabyAGI).4 

 — Large cloud and technology companies become active 
in the field of hardware accelerator designs. Google 
developed its fourth-generation tensor processing 
unit (TPU v4), for example, which has enabled an 
approximate tenfold increase in system performance 
compared with previous versions.5  Similarly, consumer 
hardware and edge systems are becoming available 
with specific designs to run LLMs more efficiently (for 
example, Apple’s Neural Engine).6 

‘We often get asked by executives if generative AI is 
hype or a fundamental shift—the answer is both. From 
a scientific point of view, foundational models are not 
hype—they comprise a new class of AI that is elegant in 
its simplicity yet incredibly powerful in its ability to be 
tuned to perform many tasks in a humanlike manner. 
From a business point of view, these technologies have  
the potential to fundamentally disrupt entire categories.’

Generative AI has seen strong and accelerating growth in talent demand since 2018. Hiring demand in 2023 
will likely be significantly higher due to increased interest and investment. Job growth in this field took a 
different path from other tech trends, with postings for directors and managers outnumbering those for 
individual contributors. Our research indicates that many businesses are working fast to develop strategies for 
generative AI. A sharp increase in demand for regulation affairs directors indicates a desire to do so in a way 
that is cognizant of public concerns. The relatively low hiring rate for technical contributors may also indicate 
intentions to first validate value by piloting user-friendly, open-source models before investing heavily in 
building internal capabilities.

Underlying technologies

Real-world examples involving the use of generative  
AI include the following:

 — OTP Bank generated a Hungarian large-language 
model to enable more than 30 banking use cases 
across the organization, with an initial focus on spoken 
and text customer interactions, fraud detection, and 
cybersecurity.

 — Exscientia is leveraging generative AI across all stages 
of its research and development process, claiming an 
average time from biological target to drug candidate 
of approximately 11 months compared with a 54-month 
industry average and at a cost that is 80 percent lower.

 — Insilico Medicine developed a generative-AI model 

to predict clinical-trial success rates with a reported 
accuracy of 80 percent.

 — Jasper, an AI-enabled content platform that leverages 

GPT-3 to generate marketing content (for example, copy 
writing, email, script writing) from provided user prompts, 
already boasts more than 100,000 customers. 

Generative AI is powered by multiple types of software  
and hardware across the entire tech stack. These include 
the following:

 — Foundation models. These are deep-learning models 
trained on vast quantities of unstructured, unlabeled 
data that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the 
box or adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning.

 — Application layer. Typically, this is the interface that the 

end user interacts with (for example, chat).

 — Integration/tooling layer. Sitting between the application 
layer and foundation model, this layer integrates with 
other systems to retrieve information, filter responses, 
save inputs and outputs, distribute work, and enable 
new features. Examples include the large-language-
programming framework LangChain and vector 
databases such as Weaviate and Pinecone.  

 — Hardware. Specialized accelerator hardware, such as 

graphical processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing 
units (TPUs), enable model training and inference tasks 
on premises or via cloud hardware. 

‘The speed of advances in large-
language-model capabilities have 
caught many executives off guard. 
It’s important to keep in mind 
that the promise of transforming 
many manual, complex, and 
creative tasks comes with clear 
risks like erroneous outputs. In our 
experience, a successful approach 
often starts with identifying  
high-value, low-risk use cases,  
for example, coding assistance  
or hypothesis generation in R&D, 
and keeping a human in the loop.’

Key uncertainties 

Big questions about the future

The major uncertainties affecting generative AI include  
the following:

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with generative AI:

 — Cybersecurity and privacy concerns are prevalent, 

 — Which workers will see their roles shift due to generative 

notably around data leakage risks and vulnerabilities 
(including leakage of customer and protected data).

 — Ethical considerations surround the responsible use of 
generative AI, including data governance, justice and 
fairness, accountability, and explainability.

 — Regulation and compliance might affect research into 

generative AI and its potential applications.

 — Copyright ownership and protection of content 
generated by open-source models remains an  
undefined issue.

 — Environmental impact may increase as training models 
expend exponentially more computational resources. 

AI, and to what extent will they be affected?

 — How will the cost of model creation evolve, and what 

impact will it have on competitive dynamics?

 — Where can organizations establish competitive moats 

and ensure their defensibility?

 — How should companies approach generative-AI-

related risks, including data privacy and security, equity, 
fairness, compliance, and copyright protection?

 — Will enterprise adoption experience the level of 
exponential growth seen in consumer adoption?

The trend—and why it matters

Next-generation technologies are transforming the 
capabilities of engineers at every stage of the software 
development life cycle (SDLC)—from planning and testing 
to deployment and maintenance—and enabling more 
nontechnical employees to create applications. They 
can help simplify complicated tasks and reduce others 
to single commands. These technologies include AI pair 

programmers; low- and no-code platforms; infrastructure as 
code; automated integration, deployment, and testing; and 
emerging generative-AI tools. Adoption may be slow due 
to technical challenges, the need for large-scale retraining 
of developers and test engineers, and other organizational 
hurdles. However, the significant productivity gains seen in 
early trials suggest widespread usage is on the horizon.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving next-
generation software development:

 — Generative-AI tools come to market. The release 

of ChatGPT in late 2022 increased interest in using 
generative AI in software development. Several 
advanced tools are now available. In June 2022, GitHub 
released its AI pair-programming tool, GitHub Copilot, 
and Amazon has since released CodeWhisperer. These 
and other tools can write code more holistically and 
accurately than existing AI-based developer tools and 
generate code from natural-language prompts.

 — Research confirms that next-generation tools 

enhance developer productivity; nondevelopers could 
benefit soon as well. Next-generation software can 
empower nontraditional engineers to participate in the 
development process and increase the productivity  
of existing software engineers. By 2026, Gartner 
predicts that 80 percent of low- and no-code tool  
users will sit outside of traditional IT organizations. 
AI-enabled tools can also enhance the productivity  
of traditional developers by automating routine tasks 
and suggesting solutions to problems. Our research 
shows that developers report time savings of 35 to  
45 percent in code generation and 20 to 30 percent in 
code refactoring. They also report an improvement in 
happiness, flow, and fulfillment while using AI-enabled 
tools, which suggests that adopting these tools  
could help companies retain talent in a competitive 
talent market. 

‘Developers are perhaps one of 
the most valuable assets for the 
modern digital enterprise, yet 
they spend well over 40 percent 
of their time on repetitive,  
low-value tasks that could  
be easily automated with  
a modern tool set.’

In real life 

Underlying technologies

Real-world examples involving the use of next-generation 
software development include the following:

The technologies that power next-generation software 
development include the following:

 — Netflix built Netflix Test Studio (NTS), which supports 
a seamless streaming experience on many types of 
devices. NTS is a cloud-based automation framework 
for internal and external developers to deploy and 
execute tests. It abstracts away device differences and 
has a standard set of tools for assessing performance. 
NTS runs more than 40,000 long-running tests every 
day and allows remote tests of Netflix-ready devices.

 — Citibank is investing in several tools for next-generation 
software development. For example, the company 
is a customer of and investor in Genesis, a low-code 
software development company. The Genesis platform 
tackles direct-automation use cases, including end-user 
computing (EUC) and client-servicing portals. Citibank 
has also partnered with Temenos, a core banking 
systems provider, for more than a decade. Temenos’s 
software improved time-consuming and repetitive 
accounting and reporting tasks.

 — Ticketmaster’s mobile-development team began using 
GitLab’s CI tools when small software changes were 
taking prohibitively long to execute. With GitLab’s CI 
tools, the team reduced build time from two hours to 
eight minutes. 

 — Low- and no-code platforms. Software development 
systems with graphics processing units, such as 
Microsoft Power Apps and Amazon Honeycode, make it 
easier for nondevelopers to build applications.

 — Infrastructure as code. This is the process of configuring 
infrastructure, such as a data center, with machine-
readable code, which enables rapid reconfiguration and 
version control. The cloud, for example, is infrastructure 
that is fully abstracted as code.

 — AI-generated code. AI applications enable a user to input 
natural-language prompts or context from existing code 
to produce code recommendations.

 — Microservices and APIs. These are self-contained, 

independently deployable pieces of code that can be 
coupled to form larger applications.

 — AI-based testing. Next-generation software can use AI

amount of time developers spend on this task.

 — Automated code review. These applications use AI or 

predefined rules that enable users to check source code.

‘We will see second-order effects  
play out over the next couple of  
years, such as emerging ways to 
apprentice new developers and 
evolutions in development team 
composition and career trajectories.’

Key uncertainties

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with next-generation 
software development:

 — To what extent can no-code tech reduce the need for 

traditional software developers? 

 — From a cultural standpoint, will teams—both developers 
and nondevelopers—embrace or resist changes in ways 
of working? 

 — What intellectual-property issues might affect 

AI-generated code?

 — To what extent will business units take responsibility for 

the health of applications?

 — How do organizations upskill engineers to know what 

good outputs from AI-enabled tools look like?

The major uncertainties affecting next-generation software 
development include the following:

 — Relying on automated testing and reviews without 

having humans check the work can lead to increased 
errors in software.

 — Growth in use of low- and no-code tools by 

nondevelopers could be limited because of the need 
for experienced developers to monitor and debug 
applications.

 — Comprehensive monitoring and version control could 
become more difficult due to uncoordinated changes 
and upgrades from multiple vendors.

 — Quality and security remain concerns with code 

generated by AI pair programmers, particularly if they 
are not regularly updated with the latest standards or 
not trained on clean, fast code.

 — Customizing APIs is difficult without significant time  

and effort. 

 — APIs introduce security risks by adding another attack 

layer that can be exploited.

Trust architectures and digital identity

The trend—and why it matters

Digital-trust technologies enable organizations to manage 
technology and data risks, accelerate innovation, and 
protect assets. What’s more, building trust in data and 
technology governance can enhance organizational 
performance and improve customer relationships. The 
underlying technologies include zero-trust architectures 
(ZTAs), digital-identity systems, and privacy engineering. 
Other technologies help build trust by building explainability, 

transparency, security, and bias minimization principles into 
the design of AI. The adoption of digital-trust technologies, 
however, has been hindered by a range of factors, including 
integration challenges, organizational silos, a lack of talent, 
and its limited consideration as a critical component of 
value propositions. Building a comprehensive trust-first 
risk mindset and capabilities requires top-down leadership 
and deliberate changes to multiple spheres of activity, from 
strategy and technology to user adoption.

Latest developments

 — Cloud migration, customer sentiment, and a shift 

These are some recent developments involving trust 
architectures and digital identity:

 — Technology resilience becomes increasingly vital to 

organizations. In 2022, a McKinsey survey on technology 
resilience assessed the cybersecurity maturity level 
of more than 50 leading organizations across North 
America, Europe, and other developed markets.  
Ten percent of respondents indicated that they have 
been forced to rebuild from bare metal (for example, due 
to a catastrophic event), with 2 percent stating that they  
have already attempted to recover from bare metal but 
were unsuccessful.

 — Regulatory developments move industry toward privacy 
engineering. Privacy controls to date have been focused 
primarily on data governance and semimanual solutions; 
however, new regulations on data localization and 
sharing, along with increasing AI and cloud usage, could 
push privacy engineering to become more important. In 
Europe, regulations such as 2022’s NIS2 Directive, which 
mandates increased cybersecurity risk assessments, 
and the 2023 Data Governance Act, aimed at stimulating 
data sharing, make privacy engineering of the utmost 
importance. State data privacy laws in the United States 
(for example, in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, 
Utah, and Virginia) and federal sector-specific data  
laws (for example, the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act, or HIPPA, and the Children’s Online 
Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA) call for a range  
of privacy compliance measures that require  
automated controls. 

 — Explainability makes inroads, but generative AI could 
impede progress. As regulators nudge organizations 
toward more transparency and customers’ trust in 
digital increases, companies are increasingly adding 
an explainable AI (XAI) layer to black-box machine-
learning (ML) models. XAI improves model quality 
and resilience by detecting oversights, which can be 
addressed by the human in the loop. The rapid rise in 
the use of generative-AI models, which can have billions 
of parameters, will make traceability more difficult and 
expensive. Generative AI will require upskilling workers 
as review requirements become more complex and 
documentation standards (such as data health labels  
and model cards) become table stakes for governance.

toward pattern-based architecture move technology 
development teams to a secure-by-design model. 
Businesses are increasingly expected to offer 
security, technology resilience, and other digital-
trust functionalities as a core part of a product’s 
value proposition. As a result, development teams are 
becoming more mindful of addressing security and 
technology risks earlier in the development and  
delivery life cycle (for example, by proactively  
identifying and self-remediating security defects  
during software development).

‘Digital-trust technologies,  
such as trust architecture,  
digital identity, privacy 
engineering, and explainable  
AI, will quietly become integral 
to our lives. Consumers will rely 
on companies to use ever-evolving 
best practices to protect our data 
and digital dignity as well as be 
responsible stewards of the data 
they collect and use.’

In real life 

Real-world examples involving the use of trust architectures 
and digital identity include the following:

 — Miami International Airport aims to implement biometric 
boarding at all gates by the end of 2023.7 The project 
uses SITA’s Smart Path, which leverages technology 
from NEC, to enable passengers boarding the plane to 
have their identity verified by camera. The system will 
create a faster and more seamless journey through  
the airport. 

 — In early 2023, the European Commission selected four 
consortiums of public and private organizations to lead 
pilot programs for the upcoming EU Digital Identity 
Wallet. The pilots will support eIDAS 2, an EU regulation 
that requires all EU member states to make a digital-
identity wallet available to every citizen who wants one 
by 2024.8 

 — Netflix engineers developed Chaos Monkey, a novel way 
to ensure resiliency is being addressed. The software 
randomly terminates servers in production to ensure 
that engineers are architecting code in a way that would 
survive server failure. 

 — A bank used a black-box sales-lead-generation model, 
which hindered its adoption by relationship managers. 
Making the model explainable made the model 
output accessible to end users through standardized 
visualization and natural-language generation, which 
not only drove adoption but also enabled analysis 
of model weaknesses to help uncover systematic 
model errors and inform necessary improvements. 
Explainability also helped the banking company identify 

features that are needed to correctly predict samples in 
underrepresented groups, such as new clients, so that 
features are not excluded from the model.

 — A top consumer-packaged-goods company was running 
into significant delays with its cloud migration program. 
To solve its issues, the organization implemented 
isolation zones, which allow enterprises to strategically 
control the boundaries, resources, policies, and 
segmentation of applications in their cloud deployments. 
This significantly enhanced technology resilience for 
the organization by preventing problems in one area 
from spreading to others and enabling a successful 
cloud migration. Similar concepts can be leveraged for 
privacy engineering. For example, isolation zones can 
be utilized to form General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR)—compliant segments, allowing for data storage 
and access only in the European Union.9 

Underlying technologies

Digital-trust technologies include the following:

 — Zero-trust architecture (ZTA). ZTA is an IT security 

design concept that assumes an organization’s network 
is compromised by default and therefore enforces 
access decisions for every interaction with every entity.

 — Digital identity. An identity consists of all the digital 
information that characterizes and distinguishes an 
individual or an entity. With self-sovereign identity (SSI), 
users control which identifying information to share 
and with whom. “Passwordless” identity allows users to 
verify and authenticate themselves not with traditional 
alphanumeric passwords but with alternatives such as 

‘“Secure by design”—inclusive of technologies such as  
zero-trust architecture as well as processes like shifted-left 
security—needs to become part of every company’s normal 
approach to business in developing products. Customers 
expect that companies prioritize their security, privacy,  
and resilience as a core part of a product’s value proposition.’

 — Tensions between privacy and fairness or privacy and 
safety can arise (for example, tension between the 
avoidance of an excessive collection of demographic 
data and the need for such data to assess and mitigate 
bias or spot harms against minors).

 — There is no one-size-fits-all approach to decipher the 
black box of large AI models to provide a meaningful 
explanation. As a result, solutions can be expensive and 
require a change in business process.

 — Many executive leaders still don’t prioritize digital-trust 
measures (such as security, resiliency, explainability, 
and privacy) as core product functionality that should 
be considered from the start of a product life cycle as 
opposed to “on top work.”

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with trust architectures and 
digital identity:

 — How do organizations manage higher customer, 

employee, and community expectations around security, 
experience (for example, frictionless login), and privacy 
by design?

 — How will regulators reconcile past standards governing 
data privacy, data permanency, and other issues with  
the capabilities and requirements of new trust 
technologies? How can regulators be increasingly 
proactive in a rapidly evolving threat and technology 
landscape filled with complexity?

 — What are the most critical systems and data types, 

and where are organizations typically exposed to risk? 
How can organizations be comfortable that they are 
sufficiently protected in line with the organization’s risk 
appetite, especially as data are exposed in the cloud and 
contract workers become more prevalent?

 — How can organizations embed leading concepts such 
as zero trust into all developments in their digital 
organization to future-proof security? 

biometrics, devices and applications, and documents. 
Businesses are developing “converged identity” 
solutions, which bring together different dimensions of 
identity into a single platform, enabling, for example, 
continuity as a person shifts from employee to business 
partner to customer. 

 — Privacy engineering. This practice governs 

implementation, operations, and maintenance of privacy 
by design. It focuses on the strategic reduction of 
privacy risks, enabling purposeful decision making about 
resource allocation, and effective implementation of 
privacy controls in information systems.

 — Explainable AI (XAI). XAI covers methods and 

approaches that increase the transparency and 
interpretability of the inputs, weighting, and reasoning 
of ML algorithms, thus enhancing trust and confidence 
in them. 

 — Technology resilience. Technology resilience is the sum 
of practices and technical foundations necessary to 
architect, deploy, and operate technology safely across 
an enterprise environment. It includes components like 
immutable backup and self-healing networks. Such 
capabilities help organizations identify and overcome 
challenges like latency, outages, or data compromise 
and have the dual goal of reducing the likelihood of 
technology risk events and enabling faster recovery if  
a technology risk event does occur.

Key uncertainties 

The major uncertainties affecting trust architectures and 
digital identity include the following:

 — Implementation complexity is significant given 

resource requirements, talent scarcity, lack of shared 
taxonomies and aligned risk frameworks, coordination 
challenges across multiple parties, and required shifts 
in organizational norms and practices needed to achieve 
effective deployments.

 — Compatibility challenges will be encountered when 

updating or migrating technologies and integrating them 
with legacy systems or with an abundance of fragmented 
point solutions.

 — Lack of standardization and widely accepted best 
practices for how or when to use trust architecture 
techniques across industries will continue to be  
a challenge.

Web3

The trend—and why it matters

Web3 goes beyond the typical understanding of 
cryptocurrency investments—it more significantly refers to a 
future model for the internet that decentralizes authority and 
redistributes it to users, potentially giving them increased 
control over how their personal data are monetized and 
stronger ownership of digital assets. In addition, it provides 
a range of possible commercial opportunities: new 
business models governed by decentralized autonomous 
organizations (DAOs) and enabled by eliminating 
intermediaries through secure (smart contract) automation, 
new services involving digital programmable assets, 

and new data storage and governance using blockchain 
technology. Web3 has attracted large pools of capital and 
engineering talent, but new ventures are still testing and 
scaling viable business models, and incumbent businesses 
continue to explore the best Web3 use cases. Early 
adopters face several challenges, including unclear and 
evolving regulations and immature and emerging technology 
platforms, often with a poorer user experience than existing 
Web2 utilities. However, companies are beginning to find 
success with Web3 pilots, including new user engagement 
models and financial-product offerings.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving Web3:

 — Some areas of Web3 experience downturns while others 

continue to soar. The crypto market saw its market 
capitalization fall more than 50 percent in 2022 amid 
declining token value of several currencies and the closure 
of multiple crypto exchanges.10 However, several other 
industry metrics in Web3 remained strong. In 2022, there 
was a 68 percent increase in nonfungible-token (NFT) 
sales count,11 87 percent growth in Ethereum core tool 
downloads,12 more than 50 percent growth in on-chain 
stablecoin payment volume, and a 60 percent increase in 
active users of Web3 gaming.13 Concurrently, the global 
tokenization market size, enabling conversion of assets 
into unique units, grew by about 23 percent.

 — The talent pool of new developers keeps growing. 

Developers remain enthusiastic about Web3 despite 
declines in the crypto market. The number of monthly 
commits to open-source Web3 projects more than 
doubled over the course of 2022 as compared with 2018.14  
Additionally, there has been a steady 60 percent increase 
in active developers from the start of the 2020 bull run 
through the end of 2022.

 — Technology continues to improve and advance. In 

recent years, the underlying technology in Web3 has 
improved and has seen an increase in adoption; as of 
2023, there are thousands of decentralized applications 
currently running, compared with about a thousand in 
2018.15 Additionally, 2022 saw the progression of new 

technologies such as “zero knowledge” systems, which 
can prove a statement without providing additional 
information and have the potential to unlock blockchain 
scalability and new use cases (that is, increased privacy). 

 — Regulatory activity ramps up. The US Congress has 

proposed more than 50 crypto regulations, and several 
other countries are increasingly watchful of the crypto 
space after the closure of multiple crypto exchanges and 
loss of token value in 2022.16 Many major economies have 
in place or have proposed digital-asset classifications, 
licensing requirements, and investment limitations, and 
government agencies have increased oversight over 
Web3 players. In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) initiated legal proceedings against 
major cryptocurrency platforms such as Coinbase and 
Binance, claiming most digital assets are securities. In 
parallel, the US House Financial Services Committee 
issued a draft bill that would create more clarity on 
what makes a digital asset a security as opposed to a 
commodity, where the majority of market capitalization 
would likely be deemed commodities.

 — A transition to sustainability begins. Given the high energy 
consumption of older systems based on proof of work 
(PoW), transitions to more energy-efficient alternatives 
based on proof of stake (PoS) have progressed. One 
notable example is “the merge” in 2022, where Ethereum 
saw a live transition from PoW to PoS, making it more than 
100 times more energy efficient.17 In addition, bitcoin miners 
(which still use PoW) are increasing the share of renewable 
energy they consume to run the consensus algorithm.18 

‘Practical, recognizable applications of Web3 that deliver 
new revenues or material cost savings—such as tokenization 
of cash, financial and illiquid assets, or swaps and lending 
via smart contracts—are the priority. Making these appear 
familiar to investors is helping expand the market and is 
facilitating due consideration by regulators.’

In real life 

Underlying technologies

Real-world examples involving the use of Web3 include  
the following:

The foundational technologies that form the Web3 stack 
include the following:

 — In November 2022, JPMorgan Chase executed its first-
ever on-chain cross-border blockchain transaction. 
The transaction involved tokenized Singaporean dollar 
and Japanese yen deposits and was executed on 
the Polygon blockchain. The trade is part of a larger 
partnership between JPMorgan Chase and DBS Bank 
called Project Guardian.19

 — Securitize partnered with KKR to launch a tokenized 
fund (issued on the Avalanche blockchain) with  
exposure to KKR’s Health Care Strategic Growth Fund 
(HCSG II). Tokenization opens up private equity to more 
individual investors by digitizing operations and lowering 
investment minimums.20 

 — 100 Thieves (100T), an esports and lifestyle brand, 

introduced NFTs to fans by simplifying onboarding and 
capitalizing on its rising brand profile. In celebration of 
its League of Legends championship win, 100T created 
a virtual diamond chain that allowed fans to freely claim 
it for 75 hours upon creation of a wallet on the 100T 
platform. More than 300,000 people redeemed the 
NFT—a majority were first-time wallet users.21  

 — After acquiring the Web3 studio RTFKT in 2021, Nike 
launched a Web3 platform called .Swoosh, which will 
offer Polygon-based NFT products to customers. The 
platform will serve as a hub for new product launches, as 
well as a medium for customers to cocreate and share 
virtual apparel designs.22 

 — Blockchain. This is a digitally distributed, decentralized 

public ledger that exists across a computer network and 
facilitates recording of transactions.

 — Smart contracts. Established in immutable code on a 

blockchain, these software programs are automatically 
executed when specified conditions (such as terms 
agreed on by a buyer and seller) are met.

 — Digital assets and tokens. Examples of these digitally 

native intangible items include native cryptocurrencies, 
governance tokens, stablecoins, NFTs, and tokenized 
real-world and financial assets including cash.

Key uncertainties

The major uncertainties affecting Web3 include  
the following:

 — Regulation is evolving as authorities choose approaches 
to governing issues such as consumer and investor 
protection, asset classification (for example, security, 
commodity, or currency) and its implications, legality 
and enforceability of blockchain-based contracts, 
accounting and tax standards, capital provisioning, 
accountability mechanisms, and know-your-customer 
and anti-money-laundering standards. 

 — Value proposition and user experience of Web3 

compared with incumbent systems (which are also 
continuing to evolve) are often not fully understood. Even 
as platforms such as Reddit and Discord are beginning 
to experiment with Web3 solutions, the benefits remain 
unclear to many consumers and enterprises.23

 — Ecosystem infrastructure is nascent and will continue 
to mature as business models (for example, merchants 
accepting digital loyalty tokens) and value chains (such 
as creation, trading, and secure storage of NFTs) are 
tested and refined or discarded.

 — Consumer protection is increasingly becoming a focal 
point for regulators, especially amid recent failures 
of several nascent Web3 projects and fraud at major 
cryptocurrency exchanges. 

 — Robustness of new technologies that depend on code 
(for example, smart contracts) or data (for example, 
oracles) is improving but these technologies have 
experienced some notable failures. The composability 
of Web3 code could also perpetuate vulnerabilities in 
applications that currently are poorly understood.

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with Web3:

 — Which Web3 business models and value chains  
will emerge as technically reliable, scalable,  
and commercially viable? What will unlock  
mainstream adoption?

 — As a cultural phenomenon, how will patterns of Web3 

adoption vary among different populations?

 — How will Web3 ecosystems coexist and interconnect 

with enterprise system architectures and with 
hyperscale Web2 platforms? 

 — How will regulatory action influence trust in Web3 and 

affect potential future innovation?

 — How will Web3 and immersive reality enable new 

experiences in the metaverse?

‘While it’s clear that Web3  
has had a difficult past 12 
months, it’s hard not to be 
excited about the space,  
given all the developments. 
Particularly on the enterprise 
side, interest remains high, and

Advanced connectivity

The trend—and why it matters

Advanced-connectivity improvements will enhance user 
experiences for consumers worldwide and increase 
productivity in industries such as mobility, healthcare, 
and manufacturing. Companies have been quick to adopt 

advanced-connectivity technologies that build on existing 
deployments and connectivity standards, but some of the 
newer technologies on the horizon, such as low-Earth-orbit 
(LEO) connectivity and private 5G networks, face obstacles 
that will need to be addressed to increase uptake.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving  
advanced connectivity:

 — Integration of various connectivity technologies  
picks up. With a variety of connectivity solutions 
(for example, Wi-Fi, cellular, and satellites) available 
for different use cases, attention is turning toward 
integrating them into a seamless customer experience. 
Major companies, such as Apple and T-Mobile, are 
investing in the integration of satellite connectivity into 
their existing products (for example, emergency SOS 
into the iPhone 14).

 — Telecom companies struggle to monetize 5G 

for consumers, and industrial applications grow 
slower than expected. While APIs for 5G promise 
telecommunications companies the ability to monetize 
the delivery of 5G to consumers, adoption has been 
slow because consumer use cases relying on advanced 
connectivity have yet to scale. Many industrial 
companies chose to wait on the adoption of 5G private 
networks due to complexity, lack of understanding of 
cellular technology benefits and management, the cost 
of deployment, and the nascent state of end-to-end use 
cases. The 5G private-network market is picking up, 
and there are lighthouse deployments across various 
industries such as manufacturing, logistics, utilities, and 
a few others.

 — The fiber market grows and begins consolidating. 

After the initial success of fiber networks in the 2010s, 
deal activity and company valuations have increased 
in the past few years. Several smaller fiber companies 
launched in recent years, but the market is now moving 
toward consolidation, with merger and acquisition 
activity increasing significantly, especially in Europe.

‘Unlocking the value of  
advanced connectivity is an 
ecosystem question. In the best 
case, it will be a virtuous circle 
where low-latency use cases, 
such as augmented reality, play 
a big role to drive demand, 
incentivize operators to push 
capacity network investments, 
and promote adoption of edge 
compute infrastructure. This, in 
turn, would drive more use cases, 
and the cycle would repeat.’

In real life 

Underlying technologies

Real-world examples involving advanced connectivity 
include the following:

The noteworthy technologies in advanced connectivity 
include the following:

 — In the Ericsson USA 5G Smart Factory, the company 

used next-generation connectivity devices to monitor 
the factory building’s energy output and reduce energy 
use. Additionally, devices were connected wirelessly to 
Ericsson’s network, making it easy to add and remove 
capacity in response to changing demand.

 — Nokia collaborated with the Finnish Environment 

Institute (SYKE) to monitor the blue-green algae in the 
Baltic Sea. A drone is used to collect surface video in 
search of the algae and transmit the data back with 5G to 
enable real-time analysis and computer vision.

 — Apple’s more than $450 million investment in Globalstar 
and other satellite providers allows it to offer emergency 
satellite coverage for its iPhone 14. Customers with an 
iPhone 14 can use this feature to contact help in remote 
areas. It has already made the news for saving people in 
dangerous situations. 

 — A partnership between Centrica Storage and Vodafone 
aims to build a futuristic gas plant equipped with 5G 
infrastructure to enable automation and monitoring of 
key maintenance and engineering operations to reduce 
costs and increase plant efficiency.24 

 — Samsung is collaborating with telecom company O2  
and the National Health Service in England to test  
smart ambulances that are equipped with 5G technology 
so paramedics can provide better and faster service to 
patients by using new features such as real-time  
video technology.

 — Optical fiber. Physical strands of glass provide the most 
reliable high-throughput, low-latency connectivity.

 — Low-power, wide-area networks. These wireless 

networks (for example, narrowband IoT, LTE-M, LoRa, 
Sigfox) can support a high number of connected devices. 

 — Wi-Fi 6 and 7. Next-generation Wi-Fi (also called 
industrial Wi-Fi) offers higher throughput, more 
controllable quality of service, and a cellular-like level  
of security.

 — 5G/6G cellular. These next-generation cellular 

technologies provide high-bandwidth, low-latency 
connectivity services with access to higher-spectrum-
frequency bands capable of handling a massive amount 
of connected end points.

 — High-altitude platform systems (HAPS). These are radio 
stations located at a fixed point 20 to 50 kilometers 
above Earth. HAPS can be deployed on lightweight 
aircraft to provide flexible capacity and access in  
remote locations.

 — LEO satellite constellations. These offer wide-area 

coverage with significantly reduced latency compared 
with existing satellite offerings and can be used to 
provide coverage in remote areas, as well as serve 
as redundancy for mission-critical applications (for 
example, high-voltage electricity networks). 

 — Direct-to-handset satellite connectivity. Partnerships 

between telecom companies and satellite players allow 
direct access from phone to satellite, expanding network 
coverage beyond the reach of traditional cellular towers.25

‘There has been a lot of interest from industrial verticals 
in next-generation connectivity benefits, and the largest 
infrastructure and telecom and tech players are making 
massive investments. However, there is still a lot of work to be 
done by a wide number of ecosystem players to compile a very 
complex tech stack that enables advanced use cases to scale.’ 

– Zina Cole , partner, New York

Key uncertainties 

Big questions about the future

The major uncertainties affecting advanced connectivity 
include the following:

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with advanced connectivity:

 — Business viability remains in question as price wars, 

 — How will changes in the fiber market (for example, 

financing and acquisitions) affect network options for 
customers? Will 5G be sufficiently monetized? 

 — How will companies respond to the long tail of smaller 
fiber operators in the market—for example, acquire, 
partner, avoid, or build potentially redundant networks 
alongside existing ones?

 — What are the expectations from various stakeholders for 

next-generation wireless technologies?

 — What will 6G look like? What needs to happen to make 

6G a success?

 — Will private-network adoption finally take off? What 
do industrial verticals need to know about it to avoid 
missing out on its benefits?

 — What are the key levers to speed up IoT adoption?

commoditization of connectivity, telecom companies’ 
struggle in monetizing better network quality, and 
ever-growing traffic and cost of deployment has led 
to consistently decreasing returns on investment for 
telecom companies globally.

 — Availability depends on the maturation of use cases, 
such as 5G-enabled robotics and gaming on the go, 
for industrial verticals and consumers requiring higher 
service-level agreements such as high throughput or  
low latency.

 — Key uncertainties of advanced-connectivity adoption 
vary by technology. For example, ecosystem maturity 
plays a critical role in adoption of IoT, whose uptake has 
been slower than expected due to a highly fragmented 
market, security concerns, interoperability, complex 
deployments involving a vast variety of players, and 
a lack of standardization. For 5G and 6G, telecom 
operators’ monetization struggles might affect their 
ability to build necessary infrastructure for at-scale 
rollouts globally. 

 — Government involvement is still unfolding and will play a 
role in terms of regulations and funding for 5G and next-
generation digital infrastructure.

Immersive-reality technologies

The trend—and why it matters
Immersive-reality technologies use spatial computing to 
interpret physical space; simulate the addition of data, 
objects, and people to real-world settings; and enable 
interactions in virtual worlds with various levels of immersion 
provided by augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and 
mixed reality (MR). Venture capital investors provided about 
$4 billion of funding in AR and VR start-ups in 2021, the 

second-most-successful funding year after 2018. Although 
total investments in AR and VR subsequently declined in 
2022, investors showed continued interest in the trend: 
at least seven investment rounds of $100 million or more 
closed last year.26 Our research suggests that the emerging 
metaverse could generate up to $4 trillion to $5 trillion in 
value across consumer and enterprise use cases by 2030.27

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving  
immersive-reality technologies:

 — Declines in investment and consumer adoption of VR 
and AR devices signal a tempering, but adoption of 
AR on flat devices rises. Investments in immersive-
reality technologies spiked in 2021, with $14 billion 
investment in 2018, $32 billion in 2021, and $16 billion 
in 2022.28 In tandem, consumer adoption slowed, with 
worldwide shipments of VR headsets and AR devices 
declining more than 12 percent in 2022 after 2021 saw 
increased sales of home-entertainment devices during 
the pandemic lockdown and increased inflationary 
pressures in 2022 tempered consumer spending.29  
However, use of AR on flat devices (for example, phones) 
continues to rise: the installed base of AR apps increased 
from 1.03 billion in 2016 to 6.06 billion by 2022.30

 — New devices continue to hit the market. Although 

hardware innovation took a dip, new VR headsets were 
released in 2022. New VR headsets are also expected 
throughout 2023, and peripheral devices (for example, 
haptics and displays) continue to advance, with new 
user-experience innovations anticipated to bolster 
the consumer market. So far in 2023, PlayStation has 
released its VR2 headset—which has high potential for 
adoption by tapping into the large existing PlayStation 
user base—and HTC has released its Vive XR Elite 
headset for the high-end consumer and professional 
segment to positive reviews. 

 — Announcements signal technical leaps in future devices. 
Apple announced the 2024 release of its Vision Pro 
AR/VR headset, which will feature technology such as 
eye tracking, hand-gesture recognition, and seamless 
scrolling. Apple supported Vision Pro with an enormous 
base of talent and capital and fortified it with more than 
5,000 patents. The company believes the headset 
could offer notable advantages and aspires to set new 
standards in the realm of mixed reality.

 — Enterprise collaborations continue pushing the trend 
forward. Investment in the enterprise segment has 
largely increased through partnerships. In August 
2022, Lenovo, for instance, announced a collaboration 
with CareAR to deliver next-generation AR wearable 
solutions for field technicians.31 Enterprise adoption is 
expected to continue rising even further as digital-twin 
use cases with the potential to improve efficiency across 
operating environments (for example, warehouses, 
clinical trials, and retail stores) emerge.

‘While we may see fewer  
devices in the future after the 
near frenzy of the past one to  
two years, we’ll continue to see 
rapid innovation of features and 
form factor in upcoming devices.’

In real life 

Underlying technologies

Real-world examples involving immersive-reality 
technologies include the following: 

 — Nike partnered with Roblox to launch Nikeland—a 
metaverse space recreating its headquarters with 
avatars featuring Nike products. The brand also  
released .SWOOSH to host community experiences in 
the metaverse and allow customers to purchase  
digital assets.32 

 — In September 2022, Lowe’s unveiled the home-

improvement retail industry’s first interactive digital twin 
of a store, intending to enable better floor management 
and customer service by allowing store associates to 
visualize and interact with the full complement of a 
store’s data.33 

 — When Morehouse College wanted to engage its 

remote students, biomolecular chemistry professor 
Muhsinah Morris introduced a virtual digital twin of the 
school’s chemistry lab to enable students to conduct 
experiments just as they would in person.34   

Immersive-reality technologies include the following:

 — Augmented reality. AR enables partial immersion by 

adding information to real-world settings.

 — Virtual reality. VR immerses users in entirely virtual 

settings.

 — Mixed reality. MR enables a level of immersion between 
AR and VR, adding virtual elements to the real world so 
that users can interact with both.

 — Spatial computing. This type of computing uses the 
perceived 3-D physical space around the user as a 
canvas for a user interface.

 — On-body and off-body sensors. These sensors detect 

objects and bodies for representation in virtual settings. 
They may be embedded in handheld or wearable devices 
or mounted around users.

 — Haptics. These feedback devices convey sensations to 

users, usually as vibrations.

 — Location-mapping software. This software integrates 
real-time user physical location and surroundings into 
AR to provide an overlay of the surrounding physical 
environment in the virtual environment.

‘Immersive experiences and real-time 3-D continue to  
grow; we expect them to become the predominant way  
we experience the internet over the next decade. Adoption 
thus far has been led by gaming; however, we continue to  
see expansion into other consumer and enterprise use  
cases, such as collaboration and high-precision training. 
Massive amounts of innovation across the underlying 
infrastructure, platforms, AI, devices, and experience  
layers continue to move fast. The critical technology  
pieces will start to come together over the next few years.’

Key uncertainties

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a  
few questions when moving forward with immersive- 
reality technologies:

 — Will immersive reality shift the new wave of  

(remote) work?

 — Will initial ideas start to break through to scale? What  

will be the triggers for breakout success?

 — How will enterprises effectively manage the tech 

infrastructure required for new and evolving consumer 
use cases?

The major uncertainties affecting immersive-reality 
technologies include the following:

 — Device improvements in hardware and software 
are needed, particularly for AR devices, to enable 
miniaturization and weight reduction, make devices 
more durable, improve sensor precision, increase user 
comfort, reduce heat output, and extend battery life.

 — The pace and level of cost reductions remain uncertain 
but will be needed to make applications more consumer-
friendly and scalable.

 — Growth in the breadth of user needs is still in question. 
The metaverse is likely a few years away from a true 
tipping point where demand grows from targeted niche 
needs to broader mass-market customer usage. Certain 
business-focused considerations, including how end-
consumer price points evolve, will also impact the pace 
of adoption. 

 — Mitigating security and privacy concerns related to 

tracking user behavior will be critical to building trust.

 — Safety concerns are also paramount when considering 
usage of vision-limiting AR and VR platforms outside of 
highly controlled environments.

 — End-user devices could take multiple forms depending 
on intended usage, from independent AR and VR 
platforms to peripheral AR accessories for mobile 
phones. Additionally, other devices, such as flat screens 
that display immersive experiences, are currently gaining 
faster adoption than AR/VR, indicating the device can 
have an impact on momentum. 

Technology Trends Outlook 2023

Cloud and edge computing

The trend—and why it matters

In the future, enterprises will leverage an infrastructure 
footprint that involves compute and storage at multiple 
location points, from on-premises to closer-to-premises 
(the edge) and from small regional data centers to remote 
hyperscale data centers. Edge computing provides flexibility 
for organizations to process data closer to their origins 
faster (ultra-low latency) and achieve data sovereignty and 
enhanced data privacy as compared with cloud, which can 
unlock a variety of new use cases. Reduced distance to end 

users will shrink data transmission delays and costs, as well 
as provide faster access to more relevant sets of data, which 
helps companies comply with data residency laws. Public 
cloud will continue to play a critical role in the enterprise 
of the future by performing non-time-sensitive computing 
use cases at much better economies of scale. Ongoing 
integration of cloud and edge resources will let users extend 
the innovation, speed, and agility of cloud to edge and 
real-time systems, thereby accelerating innovation, lifting 
productivity, and creating business value.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving cloud  
and edge computing: 

 — The rate of migration slows.35 Ballooning costs, as 

well as data privacy and latency-related issues, have 
contributed to the slowdown, though enterprises 
continue migrating to public cloud. In some situations, 
however, enterprises are “repatriating” from cloud. 
A recent study from the Uptime Institute Global 
Data Center found that approximately 33 percent of 
respondents had repatriated from the cloud to a data 
center or co-location facility. Of those that repatriated, 
however, only 6 percent abandoned the cloud altogether. 
The majority engage in a hybrid approach, using 
on-premises and public-cloud options.36  

 — Edge computing continues to attract investment. More 
than 400 edge use cases across various industries have 
been identified, and edge computing is projected to see 
double-digit growth globally over the next five years.37  
Edge adoption is on the rise for a variety of reasons, 
including a lack of reliable connectivity in certain 
locations (for example, remote factories). Through edge 
computing, data can be processed where they are 
created, allowing business decisions to be made with 
efficient data analysis at higher speeds and accuracy.38 

 — Cloud use in high-performance compute and AI/

machine learning (ML) picks up. To capitalize on the 
growth of these workloads and optimize their hardware, 
cloud providers are not only relying on partnerships but 
also investing in in-house silicon design (for example, 
Google’s tensor processing units and Amazon Web 
Services’ Nitro System).

 — Hyperscalers increasingly focus on sustainability. Google 
announced a complete transition to 24/7 carbon-free 
energy by 2030, and Microsoft made a commitment to a 
100 percent renewable-energy supply by 2025.

‘As companies move from a  
cloud-first to cloud-smart  
approach, they see edge as a 
complement to cloud and are 
getting more nuanced in how  
they approach the decision of  
where to host each workload.  
The mantra now is “do not sleep  
on the edge, because if you  
snooze, you lose!” Embrace  
edge tomaintain your edge.’

In real life 

Real-world examples involving cloud and edge computing 
include the following:

 — Baxter, a medical-device manufacturer, has avoided 

hundreds of hours of unplanned machine downtime by 
adopting a proactive maintenance strategy powered 
by an AI-based end-to-end solution hosted on edge 
computing devices.

 — Aramco uses edge-powered computer vision solutions 
to enhance safety, provide proactive monitoring for 
equipment failure, and enable automation of drilling 
equipment and processes for its offshore drilling rigs.

 — Wildlife conservation efforts in Africa use the Internet 
of Things (IoT) and edge computing technologies to 
monitor the movements of rhinoceroses and detect the 
presence of poachers over large areas of land, such as 
the Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park in South Africa.

 — Owing to growing demand, cloud providers have made 
efforts to optimize hardware for AI and ML workloads. 
In October 2022, Oracle expanded collaboration with 
Nvidia to bring the full Nvidia accelerated computing 
stack to Oracle Cloud infrastructure. In November 
2022, Microsoft announced a multiyear collaboration 
with Nvidia to build one of the most powerful cloud AI 
supercomputers in the world.

Underlying technologies

We see edge being deployed in various formats, depending 
on proximity to the user or data generated and scale of 
resources involved.

 — IoT or device edge. IoT devices such as sensors and 
video cameras are used to collect and process data 
from their sources. These devices often come with basic 
computing and storage capabilities.

 — On-premises or “close to the action” edge. These are 
computing and storage resources deployed within the 
premises or at a remote or mobile location where data 
are being generated.

 — Operator, network, and mobile edge computing 

(MEC). These are private- or public-computing and 
storage resources deployed at the edge of a mobile or 
converged-services provider’s network, typically one 
network hop away from enterprise premises.

 — Metro edge. Data centers with smaller footprints (for 
example, about three megawatts) located in large 
metro areas augment public cloud with near-premises 
computing power and storage to provide lower latency 
and/or higher availability. 

Key uncertainties 

The major uncertainties affecting cloud and edge computing 
include the following:

 — Scaling hurdles could arise as the number of edge nodes 
and devices grows because edge computing does not 
benefit from the same economies of scale as traditional 
cloud computing. 

 — Other challenges include lack of ROI visibility, an overall 

longer path to returns for edge development, lack 
of customer understanding of value-add use cases, 
large investment requirements for scaling from pilot 
to at-scale implementations, near-term oversupply of 
edge compute locations, a complicated technical stack 
requirement (especially due to integration with the 
existing tech landscape at most companies), and a lack 
of ready-to-deploy solutions.

Technology Trends Outlook 2023

56

 — Will the increase in number of storage and processing 

units lead to security vulnerabilities?

 — As data centers transition to green IT measures and as 

the amount of critical infrastructure, number of 
devices, data centers, and related energy requirements 
increase, how will cloud and edge evolve in line with the 
sustainable IT paradigm?

 — As sensor costs drop and their performance increases, 
how will edge and cloud resources cope with growing 
demand for data movement and AI-enabled analytics?

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a  
few questions when moving forward with cloud and  
edge computing:

 — Will flexibility and positioning in a business and 

regulatory sweet spot make edge more disruptive than 
cloud? Or will inhibitors such as lack of interoperability 
and commonality of standards in networking prevent 
edge from reaching its full potential?

 — Will hyperscale cloud providers win the edge race, 
and how will telecommunications companies with 
5G-enabled MEC contend or partner with hyperscalers?

 — How will rapidly evolving AI technology and, importantly, 
accompanying regulatory changes alter cloud and edge 
provider business models?

 — How will specialized chips deployed both in data  
centers and at the edge, such as AI inference or  
always-on sensors, modify the competitive cloud and 
edge landscape?

‘The demand for edge 
computing is expected to 
increase significantly over the 
next few years, and use cases 
requiring edge capabilities 
will multiply. This may create 
opportunities for a number of 
technology providers currently 
playing only marginally in the 
public cloud space to capture 
value by increasing edge 
capabilities now.’ 

– Andrea Del Miglio, senior partner, Milan

Quantum technologies

The trend—and why it matters

Quantum technologies promise to take advantage of 
the unique properties of quantum mechanics to perform 
specific types of complex calculations exponentially more 
efficiently than classical computers, secure communication 
networks, and provide a new generation of sensors capable 
of massive improvements in sensitivity over their classical 
counterparts. In principle, quantum technologies can 

perform simulations and solve problems that would lead 
to major advances across industries, including aerospace 
and defense, automotive, chemicals, finance, and 
pharmaceuticals. However, prospective users of quantum 
technologies should prepare for an uncertain adoption road 
map as technological challenges remain for the realization 
of fully error-corrected quantum computers and scalable 
quantum-communication networks.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving  
quantum technologies:

 — Hardware advancements continue. In November 2022, 
IBM revealed Osprey, a 433-qubit quantum processor 
with more qubits than any of the company’s previous 
quantum computers.39 A few months earlier, Google 
announced the first experimental demonstration of 
reducing quantum error rates by increasing the number 
of physical qubits interacting to form a logical qubit. 
Many scientists believe this provides further evidence 
that errors can be reduced enough to enable quantum 
computers to perform large-scale computations.40  

 — The talent gap remains significant but may be narrowing. 
Adoption of quantum technologies could be hampered 
by a shortage of quantum experts who can build 
devices and solutions leveraging quantum technologies. 
However, 2022 saw a slight improvement: McKinsey 
research showed that nearly two-thirds of open jobs 
in the industry could be filled with new master’s-level 
graduate degrees in quantum technologies, whereas 
in 2021, only about a third of those jobs could be filled. 
Going forward, the gap could narrow further: the number 
of universities offering quantum-technology master’s 
programs nearly doubled in 2022.

 — The focus on information security increases. In July 

2022, after hosting a six-year competition, the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced 
the first set of four quantum-resistant cryptographic 
algorithms. Meanwhile, papers published in 2022 
indicated increasing risks to 2048-bit RSA encryption, 
and the number of qubits required to break RSA 
encryption has fallen by orders of magnitude since 2015. 
As quantum hardware and algorithms improve, players 
are investing in quantum key distribution (QKD) and 
postquantum security to keep data safe.

 — Quantum scientists win Nobel Prize in physics. Quantum 

scientists Alain Aspect, John Clauser, and Anton 
Zeilinger won the 2022 Nobel Prize in physics for their 
1970s and 1980s research on entangled photons. 
Their discoveries have applications for quantum 
communications, and several companies have since 
used similar techniques to transfer information securely.

‘Given that we see algorithms 
improving and the numbers of 
qubits growing, organizations 
should think about adding 
additional protection to their 
sensitive and valuable data  
now. Bad actors could harvest  
data today and decrypt it with  
quantum computers later.’

Talent market

Quantum technologies

Demand
While quantum technology has a small labor market, talent demand has grown fourfold since 2018. Given the 
nascency of the technology, there is a low number of graduates from quantum-specific programs. As a result, 
talent is sourced from the broader fields of physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, chemistry, biochemis-
try, and chemical engineering.  Hiring in the field of quantum technology is increasing for applied roles, such as 
business development managers and data engineers. If the trend follows the path of more mature technolo-
gies, like AI, we may see the rise of specialized roles such as quantum-software engineers.

Underlying technologies

Real-world examples involving the use of quantum 
technologies include the following:

Noteworthy technologies in quantum computing include  
the following:

 — Quantum computing. Quantum processors use the 

principles of quantum mechanics to perform simulations 
and process information. They can provide exponential 
performance improvements over classical computers for 
some applications. 

 — Quantum communication. This is the secure transfer 
of quantum information across space. It could ensure 
security of communications, enabled by quantum 
cryptography, even in the face of unlimited (quantum) 
computing power.

 — Quantum sensing. Quantum sensors could provide 
measurements of various physical quantities at a 
sensitivity that is orders of magnitude higher than 
classical sensors.

 — JPMorgan Chase, Toshiba, and Ciena demonstrated 
the viability of a QKD network for metropolitan areas, 
enabling detection and defense against eavesdroppers. 
A QKD-secured channel on the network was used 
to deploy and secure a blockchain application by 
JPMorgan Chase.

 — Researchers from Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
implemented a point-to-point quantum-secured 
network in Singapore. The team connected two QKD 
devices using a production-grade optical-fiber network.

 — In early 2022, Robert Bosch, a major sensor developer, 
announced the formation of an internal division devoted 
to developing and commercializing quantum-sensing 
technologies. The in-house start-up will use the results 
of existing quantum research to create new products, 
with medical applications possible.41 

 — Quantum Computing Inc (QCi) solved a German 

automotive OEM’s complex design challenge in record 
time (six minutes). The challenge was a 3,854-variable 
optimization problem to configure sensors for a given 
vehicle so they would provide maximum coverage (that 
is, detect obstacles in different driving scenarios) at 
minimum cost.

‘Moving away from pure R&D 
toward first applications, we see 
that companies are generating 
benefits and a new competitive 
edge from quantum computing 
by applying it in combination 
with classical computers 
for first simulations of 
ultracomplex systems.’

Key uncertainties

Big questions about the future

The major uncertainties affecting quantum technologies 
include the following:

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with quantum technologies:

 — Will quantum technology be ready in the next ten years?

 — Will quantum technology reach its full disruptive 

potential?

 — How should companies prepare for quantum 

technology?

 — Will talent supply catch up to demand? What levers  
are available, and how can organizations help fill the 
talent gap?

 — Technical challenges include the ability to manage a 
sufficient quantity and quality of qubits over enough 
time to derive meaningful computational results.

 — Cost-effectiveness may take time. Most calculations 

businesses require can be performed reasonably well 
by traditional supercomputers and at a much lower cost; 
this is expected to change once quantum advantage is 
achieved and general-purpose quantum computers take 
center stage.

 — An uncertain road lies ahead. Current advancements 
in quantum technologies paint a promising future, but 
there may be potential barriers to adoption (for example, 
regulatory, technological, and financial) that are not  
yet apparent.

 — Ecosystems are nascent. Only a handful of proven 
hardware platforms are commercially available at a 
small scale, and talent skilled in quantum computing is 
exceedingly rare; this may change as the technology 
matures and adoption increases.

Future of mobility

The trend—and why it matters

More than a century after mass production of automobiles 
began, mobility has arrived at a second great inflection 
point: a shift toward autonomous driving, connectivity, 
the electrification of vehicles, and shared-mobility (ACES) 
technologies.42 This shift promises to disrupt markets 
while improving efficiency and sustainability of land and air 
transportation of people and goods.43 ACES technologies 
have seen increased adoption during the past decade, and 

the pace is accelerating as sustainability measures tighten, 
consumer preferences evolve, and innovation advances.  
For instance, autonomous-driving technologies are 
projected to create up to $400 billion in revenue by 2035.44 
Challenges remain in the near term, however, as innovators 
grapple with technological, regulatory, and supply chain 
issues that have, for example, delayed certain vehicle 
launches by up to six months.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving the future  
of mobility:

 — Leading players race to get ahead. Robotaxi and 

roboshuttle players announced efforts to scale up 
their businesses in 2022, with strategic transactions 
being made to “acquihire” talent. Meanwhile, market 
size estimates for the micromobility and minimobility45  
industries advanced to $440 billion and $100 billion by 
2030, respectively. Meanwhile, the global automotive 
software market is also expected to grow rapidly at a  
5.5 percent CAGR from 2019 to 2030. Urban and 
advanced air mobility is similarly pushing forward,  
with leading electric vertical takeoff and landing  
(eVTOL) players aggressively pursuing important 
certifications by the mid-2020s.

 — Automotive suppliers contend with ongoing margin 

pressure. In 2022, the margin pressures for automotive 
suppliers accelerated. Nearly all suppliers were 
affected by utility, gas, and electricity cost inflation 
and shortages, with 50 percent of suppliers seeing 
significant impacts. Semiconductor shortages, supply 
base consolidation, increasing costs for raw materials 
and freight, and the sometimes-daily volatility of 
automotive production volumes were also concerns.

‘Autonomous vehicles will  
make our lives safer and  
more convenient. They’ll also  
help us save money either via 
roboshuttles transporting us 
from A to B more cheaply and 
conveniently than private cars  
or via goods getting cheaper  
due to autonomous trucks.’

Real-world examples involving the future of mobility include 
the following:

 — Cruise, Waymo, and Amazon subsidiary Zoox began 
deploying autonomous mobility as a service by 
transporting passengers on a public road using an 
autonomous, purpose-built robotaxi.

A future of efficient, sustainable mobility, we believe, will  
be defined by ACES and adjacent technologies, such as  
the following:

 — Autonomous technologies. Automated systems with 

sensors and AI can make independent decisions based 
on data they collect.

 — Einride has expanded into Germany, Europe’s largest 

 — Connected-vehicle technologies. Equipment,

 — Lime became the first global shared micromobility 

provider to achieve a full profitable year, announcing an 
adjusted EBITDA of $15 million for 2022 against a record 
$466 million in annual revenue—a 33 percent increase 
over 2021 bookings.

 — Zipline, a next-generation logistics platform enabled by 
a fleet of autonomous, electric drones, estimates it can 
complete deliveries seven times faster than traditional 
automobiles and with 97 percent fewer emissions.

 — In 2022, Archer Aviation unveiled its production-grade 
aircraft called Midnight, which is described as a safe, 
sustainable, and quiet four-passenger eVTOL aircraft on 
track for Federal Aviation Administration certification  
in 2024. 

applications, and systems use vehicle-to-everything 
communications to improve safety and efficiency.

 — Electrification technologies. These solutions replace 
vehicle components that operate on a conventional 
energy source with those that operate on electricity.

 — Shared-mobility solutions. Hardware and advanced 
digital solutions, as well as new business models and 
social adoption, enable the use of alternative shared 
modes of transportation in addition to—or instead of—
privately owned vehicles.

 — Materials innovation. The use of new materials (for 

example, carbon fiber and other lightweight materials) 
and processes (such as engine downsizing) can improve 
efficiency and sustainability.

 — Value chain decarbonization. In addition to electrification, 
technical levers (such as green primary materials) can 
abate emissions from materials’ production and can 
increase the use of recycled materials.

‘The accelerated transition  
to clean transportation demands  
an unprecedented cross-sector  
effort involving, for example,  
vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, 
energy storage, recycling,  
and infrastructure.’

Key uncertainties 

Big questions about the future

The major uncertainties affecting the future of mobility 
include the following:

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with ACES technologies:

 — What share of vehicle sales will autonomous vehicles 

account for?

 — How will the future of mobility trends shape cities?

 — What needs to be in place for advancements in 

shared mobility to deliver on anticipated financial and 
environmental impact?

 — What regulatory barriers should innovators overcome to 

enable widespread adoption?

 — What scale will advanced air mobility achieve in the  

next decade? 

 — When should customers expect affordable advanced-

air-mobility solutions?

 — The global energy supply expansion that is required to 
meet electric-vehicle (EV) demand remains uncertain. 
Demand for lithium-ion batteries is surging as EV 
production expands, necessitating more and larger 
battery factories. While announcements about future 
battery supply currently match expected demand, 
McKinsey research projects that a significant portion 
of announced future supply will not materialize, so 
shortages are likely to occur.46 At the same time, critical 
upgrades are required to the EV-charging infrastructure: 
Europe, for instance, may need to invest upward of 
€240 billion to complete extensive utility grid updates, 
increase renewable-energy production capacity, and 
provide the estimated 3.4 million public charging points 
required by 2030 (up from 375,000 in 2021).

 — Safety and accountability concerns surround uncrewed 

and autonomous-mobility technologies.

 — Technology uncertainties about batteries with sufficient 
range to support more applications (such as air mobility) 
may hinder greater adoption.

 — Customer perceptions of noise and visual impact  
(for example, noise pollution from delivery drones) 
remain in play.

 — Equipment and infrastructure costs are factors for 

new modes of transportation (for instance, building EV 
charging networks).

 — Regulation shifts will accompany the development of 
mainstream certification frameworks (for example, 
controlling expanded air traffic). 

 — Privacy and security concerns for underlying AI 

algorithms and workflows that rely on consumer data 
should be addressed.

 — Access to sufficient resources (such as raw materials 
for battery production and software developers for 
autonomous-driving software) will be required to scale 
these technologies.

Breakthroughs in biology, combined with innovations 
in digital technology, could help organizations respond 
to demands in areas as diverse as healthcare, food and 
agriculture, consumer products, sustainability, and energy 
and materials production by creating new products and 
services. McKinsey research suggests that 400 use cases 

for bioengineering, almost all of which are scientifically 
feasible today, could have an economic impact of $2 trillion 
to $4 trillion per year from 2030 to 2040. While certain  
gene therapies and bioproducts have gained acceptance, 
ethical, regulatory, and public-perception issues will  
need to be settled for bioengineering to realize its full

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving the future  
of bioengineering:

 — Successes in omics-based therapies pave the way for 
further advances. The recent successes of mRNA-
based COVID-19 vaccines sparked an uptick in research 
activity around RNA-based therapeutics—more 
than 50 currently fill the clinical pipeline worldwide.47  
Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved five new viral-vector gene and related 
therapies in 2022, including Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ 
Adstiladrin for bladder cancer and CSL’s Hemgenix to 
treat hemophilia B. As viral-vector therapies shift beyond 
ultrarare indications and mRNA technology becomes 
commonplace, greater focus will go toward the tunability 
of mRNA and gene therapies to develop personalized 
“n = 1” drugs. Investments in manufacturing facilities to 
obtain higher yields, achieve lower cost of goods sold, 
and produce these personalized medicines will enable 
innovators to better capture the increasing demand for 
novel therapeutics.

 — Cultivated meat approaches increased commercial 
availability, but obstacles remain. Since diners first 
feasted upon a cultivated meat product at a Singapore-
based restaurant in December 2020, the technology has 
continued to advance: innovators have reduced the cost 
of production by 99 percent versus early prototypes, and 
the FDA completed its first premarket safety review of 
the technology in November 2022. Present estimates 
suggest that cultivated meat could provide 0.5 percent 
of the world’s meat supply by 2030, representing billions 
of pounds of meat and up to $25 billion in revenue. 

 — Climate commitments accelerate demand for 

biomaterials. Increasing focus on sustainability  
(including material reduction, sourcing, and end-of-
life fate) has changed the basis of competition in the 
chemicals and materials market, creating new demand 
for biomaterials that meet the desired profile. New 
targets released in 2023 from the US government 
require that at least 30 percent of US chemical demand 
in 20 years be met via sustainable and cost-effective 
biomanufacturing pathways. 

‘Bioengineering stands to benefit immensely 
from three simultaneous trends. First, the cost 
of data collection is rapidly coming down, with 
DNA sequencing as a prime example. Second, the 
ability to analyze and derive insights from data is 
accelerating, with generative AI being the most 
visible recent example. Third, the cost of running 
experiments is going down as evidenced by, for 
example, DNA synthesis costs.’

In real life 

Underlying technologies

Real-world examples involving the future of bioengineering 
include the following: 

The future of bioengineering will be defined by advancements 
in omics, tissue engineering, and biomaterials.

 — Moderna now has 48 mRNA-based development 

programs in its pipeline, including one focused on new 
iterations of its novel COVID-19 vaccine,48 a rare-disease 
program addressing propionic acidemia in Phase II, and 
a personalized cancer vaccine program in collaboration 
with Merck, also in Phase II. 

 — Bluebird Bio announced in August 2022 that the FDA 
approved its one-time gene therapy that treats the 
underlying genetic cause of beta thalassemia, a blood 
disorder that would otherwise require red-blood- 
cell transfusions.

 — Upside Foods, a San Francisco-based cultivated meat 
start-up, announced in November 2022 that the FDA 
deemed its chicken cultured from animal cells to be safe 
for human consumption, marking the agency’s first-ever 
review of a cultivated meat product.

 — Korea-based LG Chem and ADM launched a joint 
venture in August 2022 for US-based production  
of lactic acid and polylactic acid to meet growing  
demand for a variety of plant-based products,  
including bioplastics.

 — Omics. Biological sciences ending in the suffix “-omics,” 
such as genomics and proteomics, focus on a different 
class of molecule and its functions. Omics are central to 
the development of bioengineering applications such as 
viral-vector gene therapy (which uses modified viruses 
to permanently replace poorly functioning genes that 
cause genetic diseases) and mRNA therapy (which uses 
messenger RNA to trigger the synthesis of proteins that 
can help prevent or fight disease).

 — Tissue engineering. This technology enables the 

modification of cells, tissues, and organs. Cultivated 
meat is one example of a product based on tissue-
engineering methods; it is made by taking a sample of 
animal cells and growing it in a controlled environment to 
produce tissue that is similar to meat from whole animals.

 — Biomaterials. Materials made using bioengineering 
technology are known as biomaterials. They fall 
into several different categories: bio-based drop-in 
chemicals (which can replace chemicals traditionally 
made from petrochemicals without changing 
surrounding operations), bioreplacements (new  
materials made from bio-based chemicals that provide 
similar quality and cost but better environmental 
performance than traditional chemicals), and bio- 
better materials (completely new materials produced  
via biochemical synthesis).

‘The bioengineering world continues to see 
breakthroughs, and its economics and impact look 
promising. COVID-19 provided a spike in validation 
in some areas, such as RNA therapy and other omics, 
though others, like synthetic biology, have seen fresh 
questions about potential applications.’

Key uncertainties 

Big questions about the future

The major uncertainties affecting the future of 
bioengineering include the following:

 — Public perceptions of the safety, cost, and quality of 

bioengineered products could determine how quickly 
markets develop. 

 — Regulation of bioengineering technology and products 
will play a part in governing the pace of advancements. 

 — Ethical concerns surround the possibilities for modifying 

living organisms.

 — Unintended consequences could occur, as biological 
systems are self-replicating, self-sustaining, and 
highly interconnected. Changes to one part of a system 
can have negative cascading effects across an entire 
ecosystem or species.

Companies and leaders may want to consider a  
few questions when moving forward with  
bioengineering technologies: 

 — How will society consider diverse values and  

principles and determine an appropriate extent for 
genome editing?

 — In conjunction with business adoption, how 

will mainstream audiences perceive and adopt 
bioengineering? For example, how does cultivated meat 
fit within existing diets?

 — As cross-disciplinary innovations make new applications 
possible, what will be the long-term impact and near-
term implications of bioengineering?

Future of space technologies

The trend—and why it matters

The most significant development for the space industry in 
the past five to ten years has been decreasing technology 
costs, which are making new capabilities and applications 
more accessible. Lower component costs have been 
propelled strongly by reductions in the size, weight, power, 
and cost of satellites and launch vehicles. These reductions 
have led to changes in system architectures, such as the 
shift from individual, large geosynchronous-equatorial-
orbit (GEO) satellites to smaller, distributed low-Earth-orbit 

(LEO) satellites, as well as the increasing interest in space 
technologies from traditional nonspace companies. The 
use of space technologies and remote-sensing analytics 
is substantial today, and analysis suggests that the space 
market could exceed $1 trillion by 2030.49 The future space 
economy could encompass activities that currently aren’t 
being pursued at scale, such as in-orbit manufacturing, 
power generation, and space mining, as well as scalable 
human spaceflight.

Latest developments

These are some recent developments involving  
space technologies: 

 — Private sector leads resurgence of lunar activity. 

Japanese company ispace, which went public in April 
2023, and Astrobotic Technology, in the United States, 
are just a couple of the private companies racing to 
launch lunar landers. While ispace’s December 2022 
launch was unsuccessful, the company already has 
another lander launch planned for 2024. Astrobotic 
recently delayed a planned May 2023 launch. The 
company that finally lands a vehicle successfully will 
become the first to put a private spacecraft on the moon.

 — A watershed year for launch vehicles is on the horizon. 
Several new highly anticipated launch vehicles are 
expected to debut in 2023 and 2024, including the 
SpaceX’s superheavy Starship, designed to carry larger 
loads; the Vulcan Centaur, from United Launch Alliance, 
which is designed to carry satellites into orbit; and 
Blue Origin’s New Glenn, which will carry a portion of 
Amazon’s Project Kuiper satellites. These vehicles will 
help address the expected growth in demand for  
launch capacity. 

 — Increased interest in space comes from other sectors. 
Space is increasingly being considered for applications 
in areas outside the space industry. Hitachi Energy 
has developed satellite vegetation management for 
utilities companies to better manage and respond to 
the impact of storms on surrounding vegetation (for 
example, a wildfire ignited from electrical lines during a 
storm).50 Several insurance carriers are also exploring 
the use of satellite data to predict claims after disasters, 
and financial companies are using similar data to make 
predictions about commodities.

 — Direct-to-device satellite coverage sees investment. 
In 2022, Apple added emergency satellite coverage 
to its iPhone 14 through a partnership with Globalstar. 
The emergency SOS integration has already made the 
news for its use in successful rescues. Other companies, 
including Amazon and T-Mobile, have made plans to  
offer satellite coverage that can be used in an emergency 
or to reach areas of the world that are not covered by  
usual service.

‘Space already plays a large role 
in our lives, though somewhat 
behind the scenes. We are entering 
a new age. Space is moving into 
the public eye, with the potential 
to positively influence every 
individual on the planet and  
even the planet itself. We are  
at the beginning of the golden  
age of space for humanity.’

Future of space technologies

Demand
The space technology labor market has had a ten-year run of growth during which job postings in the industry 
have more than doubled. Job postings grew significantly in 2021, during the peak year for private capital into 
space,  and have continued to increase in 2022. Although space technologies rely heavily on traditional 
engineering fields, such as systems, electrical, and mechanical engineering, companies are hiring increasingly 
large numbers of software engineers. Prior McKinsey research indicates that traditional aerospace and 
defense companies may need to offer more flexibility and new career paths to attract top talent for these roles.¹

In real life 

Underlying technologies

The foundational technologies include the following:

 — Small satellites. Modular small satellites can be custom 
built—by using CubeSat architectures and standard- 
size building blocks—to perform a widening variety  
of missions.

 — Remote sensing. Full-spectrum imaging and monitoring 

are used for observing Earth’s features such as 
oceanography, weather, and geology.

 — SWaP-C advancements. Reductions in the size, weight, 
power, and cost (SWaP-C) of satellites and launch 
vehicles have increased the cost-effectiveness of space 
technology and associated use cases.

 — Launch technology advancements. Technology 

advancements (for example, computer-aided design, 
material sciences, and so on), the reuse of booster 
structures and engines, and increases in launch rates 
are opening up access to space.

 — Promising new technologies. Technologies including 

laser communications, nuclear propulsion, electronically 
scanned antennas, and automated satellite operations, 
are on the horizon.

Real-world examples involving the use of space 
technologies include the following:

 —  Starlink has partnered with several school districts in 
rural areas of the United States to provide high-speed 
internet service to schools and students in underserved 
areas. Pilot programs are ongoing in Arizona, New 
Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, 
and Virginia and are being funded by a combination of 
donations and government subsidies.

 — The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa 
(COMESA) and the Alliance for a Green Revolution 
in Africa (AGRA) co-led the development of a digital 
regional food balance sheet powered by satellite data to 
provide the common data and analytical infrastructure 
required to predict near real-time food production and 
stock levels. The food balance sheet led to increased 
efficiency in government food reserve purchases.

 — Rio Tinto, a leading global producer of iron ore, 

announced a partnership with Pixxel in early 2022. 
Using Pixxel’s hyperspectral satellite imaging, a form of 
high-resolution imaging that analyzes a wide spectrum 
of light, Rio Tinto plans to identify mineral resources and 
monitor both active and closed mining sites.

 — Amazon’s Project Kuiper is aiming to provide consumer 
broadband service globally through an LEO satellite 
network. It is developing compact, varying-capacity 
customer terminals, with some offering speeds up to 
one gigabyte per second. The project anticipates the 
commencement of mass satellite production in late 
2023, and the first launch is expected in 2024.

‘This is the most dynamic  
time so far in the history  
of human space activities.  
Not every idea will succeed,  
but the entrepreneurship  
and commercial potential  
are unprecedented.’
