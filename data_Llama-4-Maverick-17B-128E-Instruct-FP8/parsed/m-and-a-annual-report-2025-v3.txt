Is the wave finally arriving? 

February 2025

We are delighted to share this year’s edition of our report on M&A, M&A Annual Report:  
Is the wave finally arriving?

The global M&A market may not have matched every dealmaker’s hopes for a dramatic recovery 
in 2024, even though all major regions delivered double-digit gains despite waves of uncertainty. 
The market’s resilience, along with improving macroeconomic conditions, point to a positive 
outlook for M&A in 2025, especially as the year progresses.

Could fresh geopolitical or policy shifts create some rough spots in 2025? Certainly. But the swift 
response of equity markets, business leaders, and the media should encourage world leaders 
and policymakers to hold a reasonably steady course. 

McKinsey is privileged to serve many of the world’s leading business and financial executives as 
they pursue transactions that can improve or transform their organizations: M&A, separations 
and IPOs, and joint ventures and alliances. We work hand in hand with clients to maximize their 
success across the deal life cycle, from M&A strategy and deal sourcing to due diligence and 
integration to separation planning and execution. We bring unrivaled transaction and integration 
expertise, deep industry knowledge, a global network, and a focus on building institutional  
and executive M&A capabilities.

The perspectives we share in this report are built from this extensive experience, as well as 
research and analyses led by members of our global consulting team who have expertise in M&A, 
industry sectors, and the unique business environments in which our clients operate. We are 
grateful to the colleagues who have developed the articles included here, but most important, we 
are thankful to our clients who trust us to support them throughout their M&A journeys.

We also thank our readers. We appreciate your interest in our research and perspectives and 
hope that you will discover new ideas and valuable lessons to support your M&A activities in  
the year ahead.

Exploring the outlook 
for M&A in 2025

Powerful forces favor a resurgence in M&A, 
especially in North America, but dealmakers 
still have plenty of challenges to stare down.

Global M&A markets didn’t deliver the full-throttle comeback that many dealmakers had hoped 
for in 2024. Although performance improved (in some regions, significantly), global dealmaking 
was curbed by a variety of pressures and delivered moderate returns, with deal value up 12 percent 
to $3.4 trillion.1 While challenges facing dealmakers have evolved—some have dissipated, while 
new ones have sprung up—they remain formidable. Nonetheless, significant tailwinds are at play 
too. We anticipate that a strong upward pull will eventually swing the balance toward improved, 
and possibly sharply improved, global M&A returns in 2025.

On the surface, it may appear difficult to remain sanguine after anticipating a full market 
resurgence for several years. But many of the dynamics that stymied dealmaking for the past 
three years, including some that limited 2024 global deal value and volume to roughly the 
average of the past 20 years, are receding. If this pattern continues, then M&A markets could 
shift dramatically in the next six to 12 months, especially as the year progresses. 

Could fresh geopolitical, trade, or other policy hurdles challenge this picture? Certainly— 
like an unseasonable frost landing on a green shoot. But if history is any guide, logic should 
eventually prevail.

Not all dealmakers would benefit equally. Regions, sectors, and even subsectors are likely to 
experience market forces quite differently. Similarly, players that are already adapting M&A 
strategies to the new conditions are also most likely to thrive, with M&A markets fragmenting  
as the year progresses and consigning dealmakers into two camps: the big winners and everyone 
else. In addition to benefiting from certain geographic or sector advantages, dealmakers that 
prevail will have a vision of their strategy in sharp relief, a clear understanding of the roles of 
transactions and organic growth, and the distinct internal capabilities needed to pursue M&A 
effectively throughout the deal cycle, from sourcing and due diligence to synergy capture  
and portfolio rationalization. 

The case for optimism

Although a thicket of opposing forces is sure to play out in the global M&A landscape, 
complicating dealmaker decisions, a variety of compelling factors make it reasonable to 
construct an optimistic—perhaps even bullish—case for 2025.

First, macroeconomic conditions are more favorable than in previous years. On a global basis, 
economies have proved durable. The much-feared global recession didn’t materialize, 
employment rates have been solid, the cost of capital has declined as restrictive monetary 
policies have eased, and valuations are normalizing, even in regions such as the United  
States, where a roaring stock market delivered a 23 percent increase in the S&P 500 last year. 
(The torrid climb delivered 57 record closes, and the US stock market now commands more  
than 60 percent of global stock market capitalization.2)

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?In addition, corporations in the market for deals generally have strong balance sheets and cash 
positions (by some estimates, some $7.5 trillion in cash is languishing on nonfinancial balance 
sheets3). There’s also plenty of pent-up demand. Many companies that emphasized organic 
initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic are now looking for new avenues of growth and  
have compelling strategic and structural reasons to leap. 

For example, in industries such as banking, life sciences, oil and gas, and technology, as well as 
advanced industries, companies need to adjust their portfolios to capture innovations and new 
capabilities now essential for growth. In other industries, companies are eyeing dealmaking  
to assemble leadership platforms that will help them compete as business demands evolve. And 
always, across industries, the most successful dealmakers pursue M&A programmatically by 
making multiple small or medium-size acquisitions each year as part of their growth strategy. The 
practice allows them to outperform peers and deliver median excess TSR of 2.3 percent per 
annum.4 The approach, which includes divesting nonstrategic businesses, remains the highest 
performing and the least risky of the M&A program types.5

Moreover, following a year in which almost half of the world’s population was able to vote in national 
elections, political transitions in some countries are likely to trigger regulatory changes that will 
affect a variety of industries.6 For example, in the United States, rulings about the energy sector 
in recent years favoring green technologies are expected to sharply reverse in favor of fossil 
fuels. The US financial sector, too, could see regulations relaxed on capital requirements, consumer 
protections, and anti-money-laundering rules.7 European elections have nudged the European 
Parliament to the right, and three major EU sustainability regulations, long a source of business 
community vexation, are set to be revamped.8 And across many regions, the technology 
industry’s gathering power is already boosting scrutiny, if not new regulation.

Shifts in national politics and international alliances are also upending operations in some 
countries. China, for example, now views India as a rising competitor as Western businesses look 
to derisk their supply chains through direct investment or M&A.

All these developments add powerful incentives to shift the focus of strategies and investment in 
the times ahead, making transactions a critical tool for adapting to new requirements quickly.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The special role of private equity
One of the most compelling forces that could boost M&A in 2025 involves private equity (PE).9 
Financial investors, which historically served as a huge engine to power M&A, have a substantial 
incentive to stir from their relative torpor of recent years. Dry powder has reached extraordinary 
levels (estimated at more than $2 trillion globally). Meanwhile, exits beckon as investors look  
for ROI vintages that have remained bottled up far longer than anyone anticipated. For example, 
average exit hold times reached an all-time high of 8.5 years in 2024—more than double  
the 4.1 years seen in 2007.10

Although sponsor-led contributions to M&A volume are beginning to match or even exceed 
historical levels, their current contributions are considerably lower than those seen in the M&A 
highwater year of 2021, suggesting that there’s still room for growth. For example, PE’s 
contribution to M&A volume in the Americas in 2024 stood at $398 billion (22 percent of M&A 
activity), down from $865 billion (28 percent of activity) in 2021. Similarly, PE’s contributions  
in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) in 2024 stood at $243 billion (29 percent of M&A 
activity), down from $483 billion (32 percent of activity) in 2021. In the Asia–Pacific (APAC) 
region in 2024, PE’s contributions stood at $126 billion (16 percent of M&A activity), down from 
$279 billion (21 percent of activity) in 2021. 

Equally, the growth in the private-investment industry itself could also encourage PE to come 
roaring back. For example, in the United States, assets in private funds thrived on low interest 
rates and stock market highs from 2020 to 2023 and, by some estimates, grew 34 percent  
(to $28 trillion) during that period. That amount nearly matches the money in public mutual funds, 
exchange-traded funds, and closed-end funds. During the same time, the number of  
funds multiplied rapidly to more than 100,000, from just over 63,000, an increase of nearly  
60 percent.11 Such fecundity sets the stage for yet more dealmaking.

And now for the rain 

Of course, the challenges mentioned previously remain part of the vista for 2025, although  
the length of the associated shadows is unknown. Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the biggest 
curbs on M&A market ebullience aren’t macroeconomic or even strategic in nature but are  
more directly human made. Geopolitical instability and changes in trade policies, along with 
decisions of central bankers and regulators, are some of the most obvious currents that  
could influence economic growth and M&A activity in the year ahead. In a McKinsey Global 
Survey of nearly 1,000 executives representing 86 nations and a range of industries,  
35 percent of respondents called geopolitical instability the greatest risk to domestic growth, 
with concerns about trade policies a close second.12

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The view of trade as a potentially disruptive force domestically is a dramatic shift from surveys  
in recent years. It worries executives, especially those in North America (most cited risk, chosen by 
56 percent of respondents), APAC (29 percent), and Europe (28 percent) (Exhibit 1).13 In addition 
to fueling economic concerns, including effects on inflation and interest rates, the threat of tariffs 
could further complicate dealmaking, rendering the delicate art of valuing assets even trickier. 

For business executives—and for dealmakers, too—there appears no greater profanity than 
chaos or uncertainty.

Another potential drag on M&A in the year ahead involves regulatory scrutiny. While regulatory 
shifts in APAC and EMEA aren’t expected to greatly affect the level of M&A activity in these 
regions, new US regulatory requirements will require more comprehensive disclosures and far

deals.14 The provisions are aimed at more aggressive antitrust enforcement and necessitate 
providing information up front that agencies would normally only receive after opening  
a preliminary investigation.15 Even if these new regulations were eventually relaxed, any change 
would likely be protracted—encumbered by the need to unwind a thicket of procedural rules.

Looking back at 2024 global M&A returns

In anticipating how these and other developments will influence trends in M&A in the year ahead, 
there’s still much to learn from the global market’s recent performance.

For all of 2024, the global value of deals over $25 million rose 12 percent (to $3.4 trillion, from 
$3.1 trillion in 2023) as the number of companies changing hands increased 8 percent (to 7,784, 
from 7,206 in 2023) (Exhibit 2). Average global deal value rose 4 percent (to $443 million from 
$424 million in 2023) as macroeconomic conditions improved and as dealmakers—toughened by 
repeated rounds of volatility—grew more inured to geopolitical tensions and political transitions.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Still, external forces in 2024 stoked waves of caution among dealmakers. Megadeals (those over 
$10 billion) declined 6 percent over the year (to $664 billion, from $703 billion), and the average 
size of large deals fell to $18.4 billion, from $20.1 billion. Megadeals’ contribution to activity fell to 
19 percent in 2024, from 23 percent in 2023, and was well shy of the contribution of behemoth 
deals seen before the COVID-19 pandemic. Midsize deals (those between $1 billion and $10 billion) 
remained most popular among dealmakers, accounting for 46 percent of global activity in 2024, 
up from 41 percent in 2023. 

Corporate dealmakers accounted for most 2024 transactions around the world (78 percent, 
down from 81 percent in 2023) as financial investors, lured by lower interest rates, moderating 
valuations, and investor demand for the return of capital, began to reemerge. 

Three sectors remained the busiest for dealmakers, in line with previous years. Global energy 
and materials; technology, media, and telecom; and financial services accounted for nearly  
60 percent of the value of companies changing hands.

In 2024, major regions each experienced a different M&A marketplace—a pattern we expect to 
continue in 2025. 

The Americas
In the Americas, which generally account for just over half of global M&A market value, dealmaking 
activity in 2024 returned to the level seen before the COVID-19 pandemic. With economic growth 
in the United States increasing almost twice as fast as in other economies,16 the value of  
deals worth over $25 million in the Americas grew 12 percent (to $1.8 trillion, from $1.6 trillion  
in 2023) (Exhibit 3). Deal volume increased 9 percent (to 2,763 deals, from 2,524 in 2023). 
Average deal size grew to $648 million in 2024, from $631 million in 2023.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?With strong corporate profits, cooling 
inflation, a normalizing labor market, 
relatively low household debt, and other 
factors, the economic outlook in the 
Americas looks positive. 

Dealmakers reveled, after years of economic turmoil and uncertainty, in what was arguably the 
most stable economy since the start of the pandemic. With characteristic exuberance, dealmakers 
in the Americas closed 14 of the world’s 20 largest deals in 2024. At the same time, companies  
in the Americas attracted the most interest globally, with 15 of the 20 largest deals involving targets 
based there. With strong corporate profits, cooling inflation, a normalizing labor market,  
relatively low household debt, rebounding consumer sentiment, strong productivity (boosted 
further by momentum with AI), and two more interest rate cuts planned at the time of this  
writing, the economic outlook in the Americas looks positive, save for uncertainty around the  
new US administration’s policies.

While reduced regulation could lift US profits and productivity, policy changes affecting 
immigration, tariffs, and taxes could lead to higher prices and bigger deficits. They could result  
in slower or faster growth, depending on which of the sweeping proposals are implemented.  
The US Federal Reserve expects the economy to grow at 2.1 percent this year, down from GDP 
growth of 2.5 percent in 2024. But stocks soared immediately after the US election in November, 
suggesting that many investors were betting that the new administration would avoid disruptive 
policies—a stance that would create ballast for M&A. 

A variety of reports at the end of 2024 reported rising confidence among US CEOs. And history 
would suggest that this optimism isn’t unfounded: Over the past 40 years, annual US merger 
volume has increased by an average of 101 percent in second-term presidencies, reflecting 
greater insight into the fiscal, tax, regulatory, and foreign policies that affect boardroom 
decisions.17 CEOs hope that this pattern will hold in nonconsecutive presidencies as well.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?EMEA 
Unlike our M&A clients in the Americas, which were often pursuing growth and new capabilities, 
our clients in Europe, responding to dimmer economic prospects, spent much of 2024 looking 
for greater resilience through transactions that could boost scale, efficiency, or exposure to the 
US market. Although the European Union reined in inflation after it peaked at 10 percent in  
late 2022, other risks remain on the upswing, as geopolitical tensions remain inflamed and as the 
bloc’s two largest economies—Germany and France—face fresh political turmoil. Then too,  
EU uncertainty around policies of a major trade partner has escalated since the US election.  
A higher chance of tariffs and a trade war would damage Europe’s manufacturing base, 
including its troubled car industry. 

Lawmakers, economists, and other policy officials continue to fret about the eurozone’s waning 
competitiveness and its economy losing momentum, but so far, the antidotes are unclear. Growth 
in the eurozone is expected to land at about 1 percent for the year, down from earlier forecasts. 

Even with these pressures, the value of deals over $25 million in EMEA jumped 15 percent in 
2024 (to $845 million, from $733 million in 2023) as companies continued active dealmaking 
despite a sluggish economy (Exhibit 4). Additionally, PE firms began to reinvest, accounting  
for 29 percent of M&A value in the region, up from 25 percent a year earlier.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Average deal value also rose 8 percent in EMEA in 2024 (to $413 million, from $384 million in 
2023). The number of announced deals increased 7 percent in 2024 (to 2,044, from 1,910 in 
2023). However, even with year-over-year improvement in M&A market results, 2024 deal value 
trailed the 20-year average by 18 percent. Similarly, the number of companies changing hands 
lagged the 20-year average by 13 percent in another apparent sign of atrophy in the region. In 
contrast, average deal value and volume for the Americas and APAC in 2024 aligned closely  
with their 20-year averages. 

APAC
Overall deal value in the APAC region rose 10 percent in 2024 (to $797 billion, from $728 billion  
in 2023) but remained below prepandemic levels (Exhibit 5). The relatively small uptick obscures 
some of the fundamental shifts underway. Activity, including domestic and inbound deals,  
in Greater China has fallen by about 45 percent since 2020, for example. Australia and New 
Zealand had the largest inflows in 2024, driven mostly by a few large mining deals. Japan  
and Korea saw net capital outflows in dealmaking in 2024.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?India was the only major geography to see a decline in overall M&A activity in 2024, down  
about 16 percent from 2023, even though more Indian companies are now looking at M&A—and 
global ambitions—with stronger balance sheets, more talent, and less debt than peers in  
other countries.

We’re cautiously optimistic about an uptick in APAC deal volume in 2025. Uncertainty remains 
high in China–US relations, especially given the potential for tariffs, which is driving more 
enterprises and investors to broaden their footprints and portfolios by making deals elsewhere  
in APAC. 

In China, many deals are driven not by markets but by government directives, including the need 
to consolidate in sectors with overcapacity and to create more competitive entities in financial 
services and other sectors. Acquirers and investors overseas, especially in Japan, the Middle East, 
and the United States, are taking a keen interest in Indian firms—a trend that’s likely to continue 
on the subcontinent with its robust economic growth, increasingly strong manufacturing sector 
and supplier base, climbing quality of products, expanding engineering talent, and rising 
consumer spending.

Meanwhile, valuations have risen for companies in Japan, buoyed by more favorable regulations 
and government stimulus than those seen for companies in peer countries. Japanese  
companies will continue to seek growth opportunities abroad, while PE firms scan Japan for 
promising targets.

region rose 10 percent from the previous 
year but remained below prepandemic 
levels. The relatively small uptick 
obscures some of the fundamental 
shifts underway. 

14

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Looking ahead

For both serial acquirers and companies looking to resume dealmaking after a hiatus of several 
years, the most effective M&A practices are impervious to market cycles. Top dealmakers have 
been sharpening their tactics and sophistication at each step of the deal cycle. Whether M&A 
markets are strong in 2025 or linger under a cloud of uncertainty in some regions, some sectors, 
or globally, dealmakers can pursue practical steps to advance their state of play—no matter  
their starting position.

Given the amount of capital flowing through M&A—some $3.4 trillion in 2024—and the decades 
of research showing that programmatic acquirers create more value than peers, investing in  
M&A capabilities makes sense. Each transaction should work better than the previous one, just 
as approaches in each part of the deal cycle should advance as companies gain experience.  
The following practices, along with others described in this report, can help dealmakers boost 
M&A capabilities quickly. 

Reduce exposure to global risks
With talk of geopolitical conflicts and trade wars in the air, the use of M&A can help companies 
temper global risks while focusing on value creation. Steps that can build resilience include 
assessing supply chain vulnerabilities, exploring alternative sources, and anticipating shifts in 
both demand and market opportunities. 

Add AI to deal origination tactics
Top dealmakers are eschewing traditional target lists in favor of richer sourcing augmented by AI. 
Through advanced data analysis and predictive modeling, AI can accelerate and expand searches 
to surface not just peers in adjacencies but less-visible candidates, such as businesses tucked 
into larger organizations and those competing in a broader ecosystem. For example, McKinsey’s 
deal-scanning tool uses proprietary databases and semantic understanding to assess and 
prioritize targets. Gen AI can also scan public and private databases, monitor macroeconomic 
conditions, benchmark performance, provide projections, and identify priorities and risks  
to manage immediately after deal signing. 

Expand focus to include smaller deals
Thinking beyond large and medium-size deals can yield benefits. Especially in uncertain 
environments, smaller deals can temper transaction risks and accelerate the pace of acquisitions, 
allowing companies to test deal theses and board conviction while building muscle in critical  
M&A skills.

Create a diligence advantage
With the days of “free money” long gone, capturing full value from transactions remains as 
important as ever. Seasoned dealmakers are doubling down on diligence activities and using this 
phase to stress-test value creation drivers of investment theses, integration must-haves  
(such as IT compatibility and regulatory compliance), and new requirements (such as supply chain 
resilience, inflation pass-through strategies, and compliance with environmental, social,  
and governance policies). Once again, new AI capabilities can be helpful here, in addition to 
expediting a variety of legal tasks involved in deal negotiations, signing, and closing. 

15

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Capture full synergies
Few companies cast a wide enough net in pursuing synergies. Indeed, many focus on cost 
synergies to the exclusion of others, often overlooking valuable sources such as revenue and 
combinational synergies. In addition, some either proceed with faulty assumptions or improper 
validation or fail to reset synergy targets after closing, when scores of managers can get  
a closer look at new data and key functions. 

Sharpen integration approaches
Integrations are notoriously demanding, requiring speed, care, and a Solomon-like focus balanced 
among integration priorities and business continuity. Rather than relegating this work to back-
office domains, top dealmakers are elevating their approach. They deploy AI to create more space 
for nuanced problem-solving, for example, by automating key tasks or training integration 
leaders and their teams on M&A best practices and the organization’s specific playbook. Top 
dealmakers are also sharpening integration blueprints to define the depth and pace of integration 
for individual functions and to ensure that deal rationale and value creation objectives are  
tightly linked to execution plans. Such blueprints are an important grounding mechanism. They 
allow acquirers to enlist far larger teams (from dozens to hundreds of managers) in integration 
activities, supporting both sound decision-making and buy-in for change. With a similar focus on 
precision, many dealmakers are tailoring more imaginative menus of incentives to retain critical 
talent during the integration and longer term. 

Use transactions to forge transformations
Few events can catalyze transformations as effectively as major deals can. While transactions 
can succeed on any number of dimensions—for example, by delivering gains in capabilities, 
synergies, or talent or by improving supply chains, distribution, customer segments, or geographic 
reach—a transaction can play a distinctive role in launching a broad transformation. In 2025, 
many dealmakers are likely to have an opportunity to create platform deals that can reshape 
market structures and reorder entire industries, as well as shuffle leadership positions.

To help navigate the complexities of the global M&A environment in 2025, this report provides 
in-depth discussions on trends and best practices. We offer perspectives on some of  
the critical issues likely to influence performance in a variety of sectors, as well as insights on 
issues of central importance to M&A leaders.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving? 
The industry overview—and opportunities for 2025 and beyond

Our research shows that M&A activity level in advanced industries in 2024 was similar to that in 
2023 but only half the M&A activity levels in 2020 and 2021 (measured by total deal value). For 
the purposes of our analysis, the advanced industries sector includes companies in automotive, 
aerospace and defense, industrials and electronics, and semiconductors. In 2024, there were 
812 deals announced involving these companies and $196 billion invested overall. Compared 
with 2023, the total number of deals increased by about 5 percent, while the total deal value 
decreased by about 10 percent, driven by an increase in the number of smaller deals (those with  
a value of less than $1 billion).

Most of 2024’s transactions occurred in the second half of the year, suggesting deal momentum 
moving into 2025. In fact, a number of trends point to an uptick in M&A activity within advanced 
industries and among subsectors, including reduced interest rates and the emergence of new 
technologies, software, and ecosystems. Companies in this sector will likely continue to pursue 
carve-outs and joint ventures as alternatives to acquisitions to better manage corporate 
portfolios and risks.

Additionally, a substantial amount of capital is available among major private equity (PE) players, 
which may prompt further M&A activity in this sector across regions. About $940 billion in dry 
powder was available in 2024, and 22 percent of advanced industries transactions were associated 
with PEs. About 35 percent of global PE buyout volume was deployed in advanced industries in 
2024, compared with under 20 percent less than a decade ago. For these and other reasons, PE 
activity in advanced industries is likely to continue in 2025. 

Subsector activity

Trends varied across the four subsectors we analyzed. Rapid evolution in the automotive space is 
presenting significant opportunities for suppliers that have robust M&A programs. M&A is 
becoming an attractive option for aerospace-and-defense players seeking to address geopolitical 
shifts, emerging technologies, and changing service models. M&A is a compelling option for 
industrials and electronics companies, as well, in different verticals. And a critical driver of M&A 
in semiconductors is accelerating growth in AI and other technologies. 

Automotive and assembly
Economic uncertainty was a factor in the substantial decrease in automotive deal volume in 2023 
and 2024, but the major players in this subsector have continued to explore partnerships and 
acquisitions focused on electric-vehicle infrastructure, connected-vehicle technologies, and 
autonomous-driving capabilities. 

Suppliers already have the lowest profitability among all the players in the automotive value 
chain. On top of that, they face cost pressures from tier-two suppliers and OEMs and are 
experiencing disruption from shifting value pools for certain components, such as gas tanks and 
batteries. These dynamics and others will continue to make M&A an attractive proposition for 
suppliers in 2025. 

21

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?As the prospects for growth in internal-combustion-engine technology continue to narrow, 
suppliers will be on the lookout for ways to increase efficiency, including through moves to 
reshape their portfolios. Additionally, given the previously mentioned cost pressures from OEMs, 
suppliers will need to pursue transactions that allow them to scale and limit margin erosion as 
they develop and adapt resilient growth platforms to support eventual zero-emission vehicles. 
And finally, to grow, suppliers will need to continue to differentiate themselves through vehicle 
software and electronics as traction increases for electrical and electronic solutions like 
advanced driver assistance systems. 

M&A activity among OEMs has been muted recently because of market uncertainties; the few 
sizable deals that did occur were connected to partnerships and joint ventures—for instance, the 
joint venture between Rivian and Volkswagen, with an expected total deal size of $5 billion.1 
Activity is likely to remain stable in 2025, with some OEMs selectively pursuing transactions to 
improve their competitiveness and transform in ways that allow them to address software and 
electrification trends. 

For buyers, the current expansion of Asia–Pacific companies into Europe—such as the partnership 
between Luxshare and Leoni2 and AAC Technologies’ acquisition of Premium Sound Solutions—
is likely to continue.3 Interest in automotives is growing, and companies have an opportunity to 
gain exposure to the European market while valuations remain below previous peaks. More M&A 
activity is likely in the Asia–Pacific region as the automotive value chain evolves. 

Aerospace and defense
Over the past few years, M&A activity among aerospace-and-defense companies has been 
concentrated in North America—for instance, Boeing’s $8.3 billion acquisition of Spirit 
AeroSystems.4 There has been a lot of PE activity, which will continue as PE plays an important 
part in the roll up of smaller companies (those with less than $1 billion in value). 

There has also been a general trend of aerospace-and-defense companies moving away from 
their traditional structures—for instance, conglomerates divesting their business units and 
smaller companies rolling up to scale—and consolidating their supply chains. Looking ahead, 
more separations are likely as investors see more value in specialists than in conglomerates, 
along with more trimming of portfolios and trading of assets. 

The emergence of new technologies and space-related solutions, including unmanned aerial 
vehicles and space sector systems, presents intriguing M&A opportunities in this sector. 
Geographic expansion will likely be the goal for acquirers of space-related assets—particularly 
deals involving Europe and the United States—given ongoing geopolitical competition between 
China and the United States.

3 “Ardent Equity and VE Partners have sold Premium Sound Solutions to AAC Technologies,” Lincoln International, March 19, 2024.
4 “Spirit AeroSystems announces acquisition by Boeing in $8.3 billion transaction,” Spirit AeroSystems, July 1, 2024.

22

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Industrials and electronics
In 2025, companies in industrials and electronics manufacturing will likely show increased 
interest in acquisitions involving software, AI, sustainability and decarbonization technologies, 
and supply chain resilience as they continue to reposition their portfolios for growth. Such  
a focus may translate into more carve-outs in this sector.

Taking a closer look at various subsectors, we see that companies in the building technology 
ecosystem are investing more than others are in connected technologies, which presents  
an opportunity for those companies in the residential space to build brand loyalty and shift value 
capture to OEMs. Meanwhile, companies in the commercial and industrial spaces will need to 
focus on capabilities to secure their shares in high-growth markets. To understand why, consider 
Honeywell’s $4.9 billion acquisition of Carrier’s Global Access Solutions business.5 Commercial 
and industrial companies will especially need to focus on adding software capabilities in 
enterprise access solutions, electronic lockboxes, and scheduling software. 

Across all subsectors in industrials and electronics manufacturing, the rapid transition toward 
more sustainable and energy-efficient technology (like heat pumps and electric motors) is likely 
to accelerate equipment purchase cycles.

Semiconductors
The semiconductor subsector is likely to continue to experience strong demand in 2025, driven 
by the increasing use of AI and trends in the automotive industry. However, semiconductor 
companies will also likely continue to experience a shortage of talent and will need to manage 
implications from geopolitics. M&A will remain an attractive tool for diversifying and expanding 
geographically and for bolstering capabilities in areas such as AI chips and high-performance 
computing. In fact, the sector will likely see a steady flow of deals, even as some capital 
expenditures are postponed because of economic uncertainty.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The industry overview

M&A in the financial-services industry is recovering from the global slowdown of 2023. Monthly 
deal value in 2024 returned to the average monthly value of the prior five years, and total deal 
value for 2024 was 30 percent higher than that seen in 2023. 

Nine out of ten financial-service deals in 2024 were made within national borders—up from six 
out of ten in 2021—reflecting global economic uncertainties and rising cross-border regulatory  
and geopolitical hurdles. As anticipated by McKinsey’s 2024 M&A report, scale and capability 
deals proved to be the driving force in deal rationales1 (80 percent of total industry deal value). 
The share of bank acquisitions in total industry deal value declined by almost half (from 44 percent 
in 2020 to just 28 percent in 2024), reflecting uncertainties about the quality of some bank 
portfolios, capital pressures from higher interest rates, and expected regulatory changes. 

Dealmaking picked up in the capital-market, wealth-and-asset management, and fintech-and-
payment sectors, where many dealmakers see increasing opportunities for profitable growth. 
Together, those three subsectors represented 66 percent of deal value in 2024, up from less than 
50 percent in 2020—and the majority of the largest financial-service deals were in these sectors. 

The capital-market sector is expanding into high-growth and high-margin subsectors (such as 
into private markets and into fintech and payments). The wealth-and-asset-management sector 
is focusing more on consolidation and cost reduction; each of the largest deals in that sector 
included plans to strengthen businesses’ core models and create efficiencies with larger bases 
of assets under management. 

Armed with an unprecedented more than $2 trillion in dry powder, private equity firms continued 
to play a noteworthy role in the sector, focusing on capital-light businesses (such as capital-market 
technology and data-and-asset-management technology). 

Opportunities for 2025—and beyond

Dealmakers are adapting to shifting dynamics across sectors. The banking, wealth-and-asset-
management, fintech-and-payment, and capital-market segments each face distinct challenges 
and opportunities. 

Deals in commercial and retail banking will continue to focus on sector consolidation as more 
countries look for “soft landings” amid lowering interest and inflation rates. In the United States, 
the second administration of President Trump may provide regulatory tailwinds for further 
consolidation of a highly fragmented market that still has over 4,000 banking institutions. While 
we expect that most dealmaking in the sector will continue to be driven by midsize institutions, 
some larger banks are also contemplating inorganic growth opportunities. Within Europe, we 
anticipate further cross-border banking consolidation, given a growing consensus among 
policymakers and executives about the need to provide European banks with opportunities to 
become more competitive on a global scale.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?In-market consolidation is also likely to continue in the Middle East, where half of the largest 
banks in key geographies have made deals in the past five years. We expect this trend to 
continue, with more momentum toward acquiring businesses in Islamic banking, given its robust 
growth (about 11 percent annually, compared with 8 percent in non-Islamic banking). In Asia,  
we expect deal activity to remain muted. Banks in that region are focusing more on digitalization 
to counter the growth of new digital players; however, we do expect to see further consolidation 
in markets like Indonesia and Malaysia.

Wealth-and-asset-management companies will likely continue to see dealmaking momentum. 
Both traditional and alternative asset managers will continue to expand into the alternatives 
space. Alternative asset managers will also continue to look for partnership and acquisition 
opportunities in insurance to tap a stable source of capital while providing higher returns. 
Distribution in wealth and asset management will also likely continue its trend toward greater 
consolidation—a push that is driven in large part by private equity funds and banks. 

Many fintech companies struggled to secure funding in 2024, with investments continuing to 
trail the sector’s peak in 2021. Limited cash flow across the sector is likely to lead to further 
consolidation, with larger, well-capitalized companies seeking to scale up by acquiring smaller 
players. We expect banks to remain cautious and play only limited roles in fintech acquisitions.  
We also expect some acquisitions in the digital-assets space as cryptocurrencies become more 
mainstream, with deal activity rising to help legacy companies in the sector catch up with new 
technological developments, especially in the United States. 

In payments, a considerable share of the sector is already consolidated, reducing the potential 
for megadeals. Hence, we anticipate that acquisitions will focus on smaller capability deals.  
Given momentous pressures from growing regulatory scrutiny, the strains of public reporting, 
and expectations from public-market investors, coupled with lower market valuations, some 
payments companies could be driven out of the public markets.

In capital markets, infrastructure players are very excited about expanding into data and 
technology. Given that relatively few large targets remain in this space, most activity will focus on 
smaller deals as firms look to augment their data and technology capabilities across asset 
classes and the investment value chain.

Private capital firms will continue to look for opportunities to acquire fintech companies for 
multiple financial services, as well as to effect consolidations within the registered investment 
adviser space. Many funds are looking for exits, and we expect them to look for opportunities  
to offload some of their assets to strategic investors. Average holding periods are now exceeding 
six (and in some cases, approaching seven) years, depending on the region.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The industry overview

The consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) industry has historically outperformed most other 
industries, thanks to high growth and consistent margins. But since 2012, the formula has broken 
down. Several factors, including inflation (which affects both consumer spending and corporate 
cost), market saturation, intense competition, changing consumer tastes and behaviors, and a 
fragmented consumer base, have presented challenges for growth. Additional headwinds include 
climate change, which affects key ingredients, including cocoa. These challenges have been 
persistent and have forced companies to seek new paths for value creation—and to reconsider 
the role that M&A, including divestitures and alternative transactions such as joint ventures and 
alliances, can play.

From 2013 to 2018, many CPG players chased growth inorganically, and several transformational 
deals helped shape the industry. Then, from 2019 to 2022, multiple CPG companies sought a 
more incremental approach, in particular by acquiring higher-growth brands and entering into 
adjacencies. Smaller challenger brands were snapped up at tech-style multiples, riding “better 
for you” tailwinds with the potential for larger companies to substantially boost their growth 
rates. But as multiples went up, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, and consumers began returning 
to long-trusted brands—and CPG companies rethought their strategy. 

With interest rates and industry multiples still high over the past several years, we have seen less 
deal activity. Moreover, many leading CPG companies are taking a more measured approach, 
focusing on midsize deals and seeking to achieve both growth and cost synergies. Companies 
have tried to overcome organic headwinds by pursuing inorganic strategies that not only support 
entry to adjacent or near-adjacent product categories (with accretive growth trajectories) but 
also have similar capability and operating requirements. This allows for meaningful top- and 
bottom-line synergies that justify high deal multiples. 

This more balanced approach has been exemplified in several signature deals over the past two 
to three years, including Mondelēz International’s 2022 acquisition of Clif Bar, J.M. Smucker’s 
2023 acquisition of Hostess Brands, and in 2024, Mars’s acquisition of US-based snack company 
Kellanova and Carlsberg’s announced deal for the UK-based beverage company Britvic—a 
transaction that would not only expand product offerings but also offer synergies in supply chain 
and distribution. Indeed, each of these deals provides the acquirer with exposure to incremental 
food categories that have higher future growth rates than the products in the acquirer’s core 
portfolio do while also providing opportunities to capture cost synergies (such as reduced 
expenses in direct inputs, distribution, and SG&A). 

As we predicted last year, higher-than-average interest rates and high multiples foreshadowed 
lower deal volume and value in 2024 (especially in Europe).1 Additionally, given the challenges 
faced by CPG companies in seeking organic growth and consistently creating meaningful value, 
the flagship deals that were announced last year were more transformational in nature, allowing  
for considerable opportunities to capture large synergies. Indeed, the Mars deal has led other  
CPG companies in North America to seriously consider potential further consolidation in other 
non-food-and-beverage consumer sectors that have struggled to achieve organic growth. 

1   Harris Atmar, Jeff Cooper, Stefan Rickert, and Rodrigo Slelatt, “Consumer goods: A changing landscape for successful M&A,” 

McKinsey, February 29, 2024.

32

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The broad downward trend of interest rates, coupled with CPG companies’ strong, cash-rich 
balance sheets (and greater ability to take on what is now more affordable debt), could suggest 
increased deal activity in the near future for the sector, with a mix of three types of transactions: 
signature, sector-shaping deals; sizable horizontal deals that enable greater subcategory 
consolidation; and targeted spin-offs of brands and business units that have limited synergies or 
growth prospects with their present owner. Strategic focus led Reckitt Benckiser, for example, to 
carve out a portfolio of noncore home care brands and consider divesting its nutrition business 
and led Unilever to sell its ice cream business. 

Opportunities for 2025—and beyond

Overall, we expect 2025 to be an active year for CPG deals. Strategic buyers clearly hold 
advantages when it comes to sector-shaping and horizontal deals, given the potential for 
combinational synergies. Financial buyers, for their part, are likely to be active as well—
particularly given private equity (PE) funds’ proven ability to improve operational performance 
and create meaningful value. PE funds also hold substantial dry powder.

The consumer sector, of course, is broad, and much of this analysis has focused on the food-and-
beverage sector. The emphasis is intentional: While we expect to see heightened activity across 
CPG sectors, particularly in the personal care and beauty sectors, we also expect that the food-
and-beverage sector will continue to propel the lion’s share of deals.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The industry overview 

M&A activity in the global energy-and-materials (GEM) sector remained muted in 2024.  
The number of deals increased about 12 percent, and deal value grew from $722 billion in 2022 
to $808 billion in 2024, consistent with 2023 figures. Deal value in 2024 was still 14 percent 
lower than it was in 2021 (in nominal terms). The Americas region was the major driver of deal 
value, but Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) gained ground, especially compared  
with activity in 2023. Companies are continuing to pursue smaller deals aimed at consolidation 
rather than large deals or other bold portfolio moves. Indeed, the watchword for energy and 
materials companies has been “caution,” given the run of elections around the world in 2024 and 
the impact of other geopolitical and macroeconomic factors. 

Opportunities for 2025—and beyond

Despite ever-present uncertainties in the sector, we anticipate an increase in M&A activity among 
energy-and-materials companies in 2025. A range of factors suggests more deals are on  
the way. For instance, interest rates in Europe are expected to return to previous levels by 2027. 
Additionally, companies in this sector need to reshape their portfolios, and many have cash  
that they are seeking to invest. Also, private equity (PE) firms are continuing to accumulate 
substantial amounts of dry powder. 

Our research shows that PE accounted for 16 percent of the total deal value in GEM in 2024, 
which was higher than in 2023 but still below the historical average of 20 percent between 2020 
and 2022. Much of the PE activity has been focused on spinouts, suggesting that strategic 
players view PE funding as a catalyst for spinning out assets before they get to the point of being 
mature enough for a full-on acquisition. 

Despite recent discussions about trade tariffs, our research shows that cross-regional deals are 
again becoming more important in energy and materials. In fact, they increased from 13 percent  
of total deal value in 2020 to 19 percent in 2024. We anticipate that companies in this sector will 
continue to focus on international deals in 2025, with some exceptions in specific subsectors. 

Subsector activity

Across all four subsectors we analyzed—electric power and natural gas (EPNG), oil and gas, 
chemicals and agriculture, and materials—40 percent of the largest deals could be classified as 
consolidations. But the reasons for consolidation and M&A activity varied across subsectors,  
as did the areas of opportunity. 

Deals in EPNG, for instance, shifted ownership to private investors. M&A activity in this 
subsector was also conservative because of the industry’s intrinsically higher input costs and 
lower wholesale power prices, all of which have historically served to thwart its momentum. 

By contrast, transactions in the oil and gas sector were predominantly regional, with companies 
aiming to improve their cost positions. Chemicals and agriculture companies continued to focus 
on divesting noncore assets to streamline their portfolios. And in the materials sector, companies 
consolidated through transatlantic deals, with transactions in paper and packaging aimed at 
expanding into new geographies and product areas so companies could meet ever-shifting 
customer demands.

37

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?EPNG
Deal value in EPNG increased 40 percent in 2024 compared with 2023, with much of the M&A 
activity in this subsector focused on asset transfers and consolidation. There were some regional 
deals in the transmission and distribution segments—for example, Italgas’s acquisition of 2i Rete 
Gas for $5.8 billion will allow it to cover more than half of Italy’s gas volume.1 As noted previously, 
EPNG has faced several macroeconomic challenges; the uncertainty in this sector will continue 
because of higher input costs (capital expenditures) and lower projected wholesale power prices. 

Despite the ongoing global transition to renewable energy, certain EPNG subsegments, such  
as offshore wind, haven’t performed as well as anticipated, prompting some smaller companies 
to exit the market. The risk/return profile simply wasn’t attractive enough for them to remain. 
However, that may change, and more may reenter the market, buoyed by delivery commitments 
from some of the larger EPNG companies. In 2024, the number of wind deals increased by  
35 percent compared with 2023. And interest in renewables among large strategic players is 
expected to continue—along the lines of, for instance, Equinor’s acquisition of a minor stake  
in Ørsted2 and BP’s offshore-wind joint venture with JERA in late 2024.3

The overall outlook for EPNG across the globe is generally positive, but the EPNG industry in 
Europe still may face some challenges. For instance, some forecasts suggest there will be  
a 15 percent decrease in energy demand in this region until 2050 because of a projected decline 
in the use of fossil fuels and an increase in the consumption of electricity.4 As a result, EPNG 
companies in Europe will need to explore alternative off-take options to stay competitive. 

As mentioned previously, PE investors have taken on more ownership of EPNG assets over  
the past few years; in 2024, they demonstrated increased interest in renewable assets  
and related companies, such as equipment and service firms. We anticipate this interest will 
continue in 2025, as financial investors continue to diversify their portfolios, integrating 
advanced technologies and expanding their global reach through more EPNG deals. For their 
part, strategics will need to shape their M&A strategies—including programmatic M&A—to  
make the right moves in this environment.

Oil and gas
In 2024, oil and gas companies were focused on consolidating their portfolios and improving 
their cost positions. After heightened activity over the past several quarters, this subsector—
which, in our analysis, also includes petrochemicals—has experienced a number of restructurings 
and closures, such as with various crackers in Europe. These and other industrial challenges 
have prompted some oil and gas companies to pursue deals that will allow them to move into new 
adjacencies and regions, with a focus on the United States (Permian Basin)—think of the recently 
closed upstream deal between ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil5 and of Chesapeake Energy’s 
merger with Southwestern Energy, which allowed Chesapeake Energy to become the largest 
natural gas producer in the United States.6 M&A activity among oil and gas companies picked up 
in other regions as well, including in the North Sea.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Our analyses suggest oil and gas companies are likely to continue pursuing deals that can  
help them achieve sustainable growth—as was the case in ADNOC’s (Abu Dhabi National  
Oil Company) acquisition of Covestro7—or create more value from waste streams and  
recycling technologies. 

Chemicals and agriculture
In 2024, M&A deal value in the chemicals and agriculture subsector decreased by more than  
25 percent compared with 2021, and the sharpest decline in acquisitions was in the Americas 
region (more than 50 percent). Interestingly, the locus of M&A activity shifted substantially:  
Most acquisitions were in the Asia–Pacific region (consistent with previous trends), and for the 
first time in five years, European acquirers outnumbered their American counterparts in value 
and volume. 

Deals in this subsector were motivated by chemicals and agriculture companies’ desire to 
optimize portfolios, and they included carve-outs—such as Lanxess selling its urethane business 
to UBE—as well as acquisitions of assets that were under restructuring. For instance, DuPont’s 
announced split into three independent companies was notable in that the separation was 
designed to help the company achieve higher productivity and greater efficiency by remaking 
itself as a “diversified industrial company.”8

Materials
Materials companies were also focused on consolidation in 2024—in some cases, through 
transatlantic deals. Challenging market conditions have prompted companies in this subsector to 
find ways to scale so they can better serve customers. (In our analysis, materials companies 
comprise businesses in paper and packaging, metals, engineering and construction, building 
materials, and mining.)

M&A activity by materials companies has been driven, in part, by the need to succeed with 
insourcing and vertical integration efforts, innovate new product and service offerings, and 
improve general and administrative operations. Examples of recent megamergers in paper and 
packaging include mergers between Smurfit Kappa and WestRock, International Paper and  
DS Smith, and Amcor and Berry Global. 

Meanwhile, engineering and construction companies have historically used M&A to expand 
regionally or to specialize in certain product or service areas. Going forward, however, outsize 
growth may become the goal for companies in this subsector. Government infrastructure 
programs, such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in the United States and the 
European Green Deal, may prompt more investments, and thus more opportunities, for 
engineering and construction companies. Other trends influencing M&A activity in this subsector 
include considerable housing shortages in the United States, the worldwide need for critical 
infrastructure upgrades for utilities and data centers, a growing need for more warehouses as 
global supply chains are decoupled, and falling interest rates in Europe and North America, 
which could further help boost investments in housing and infrastructure projects.

shareholders,” Covestro press release, October 1, 2024.

8 “DuPont announces plan to separate into three independent, publicly traded companies,” DuPont press release, May 2024.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?M&A activity among mining companies continued to trend upward, as it has since 2023, with an 
uptick in midsize and large deals. Chinese investors are likely to continue to show interest in 
mining companies, given their increased ownership in copper, lithium, and nickel mining over the 
past decade. And trends such as shifts to electrification and electric vehicles, as well as the 
energy transition, will continue to prompt even greater M&A activity in the mining segment—for 
example, Rio Tinto’s acquisition of Arcadium Lithium was designed to boost Rio Tinto’s position 
among providers of energy transition commodities.9

The story is similar in the metals segment, where companies are using M&A to optimize their 
footprints and cost positions—for instance, targeting deals along the value chain or fostering 
long-term supplier partnerships. New entrants, such as those focused on green steel production, 
are steering the industry toward more innovation. M&A may be an effective way for these 
companies to scale quickly, secure the inputs and resources they need, and optimize costs. 

Clearly, companies in global energy and materials are facing inevitable headwinds, with talk of 
trade tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty. But even amid these clouds, some bright spots are 
appearing: lower interest rates, the resolution of political elections, and lots of dry powder among 
investors. The signs point to more deal activity in 2025, not less.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The industry overview 

Life science companies are preparing for an upswing in M&A activity in 2025. Expectations for 
improved economic conditions, a regulatory environment more favorable than those seen recently, 
and companies’ need to augment their pipelines suggest that there could be a strong rebound in 
dealmaking. Life science companies that build robust, end-to-end M&A capabilities that leverage 
advanced tools, comprehensive diligence, and tailored integration strategies will be best 
positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities. 

After an increase in deal volume in 2023—driven by a few large deals, such as Pfizer’s  
acquisition of cancer therapy maker Seagen for $45.7 billion—M&A activity in the life science 
sector fell in 2024 by roughly 24 percent, receding to 2022 levels. This reflected a cautious 
approach from many life science companies as they navigated a challenging economic and 
geopolitical landscape. 

Of life science companies’ deal value in 2024, 69 percent was in the Americas; 17 percent was in 
Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and 14 percent was in Asia–Pacific. Biotechnology 
and pharmaceutical companies remained the primary drivers of life science M&A, accounting for 
44 percent and 28 percent, respectively, of industry deal volume. Private equity (PE) activity in 
life science dealmaking regained momentum after a year of lower activity, increasing its share of 
dealmaking activity from 11 percent of industry deal volume in 2023 to 15 percent in 2024. 

Opportunities for 2025—and beyond

Several factors indicate a rebound in life science M&A activity in 2025. The first is pent-up 
demand. Life science and PE companies both have historically high levels of dry powder.  
The second factor is a widening performance gap. The majority of growth has been driven by 
top-decile performers, and there is a widening delta between leaders and laggards both  
in EBITA margins and in TSR. Third, and critically, is the state of company pipelines. Multiple 
companies hold assets with looming losses of exclusivity by 2027, which would represent  
a material decline in revenues. 

As a result, life science companies are preparing for an M&A upswing. To start, in light of the 
current market environment, they are reassessing their competitive advantages in core areas to 
identify areas to strengthen their strategies and build appropriate M&A blueprints. Leading 
players are using advanced analyses to address life cycle compression. In parallel, effective 
leaders are creating organizational conviction and enabling their teams to deploy advanced tools 
to ready their companies for action. Moreover, well-prepared companies are building financial 
and operational capabilities to finance, structure, execute, and integrate M&A transactions in a 
complex and constantly changing environment. 

The year 2024 was marked by geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory 
uncertainty (including, in the United States, the wake of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and 
the proposed Medicare Most Favored Nation Model). All of these elements affected pharmaceutical 
pricing and market dynamics. But life science companies are adapting. Greater clarity should 
make for more favorable M&A activity in 2025. 

44

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Subsector activities

Biopharma companies, despite the slowdown in deal activity in 2024, are financially positioned 
to act decisively. Between 2020 and 2023, cash reserves across these sectors increased  
by 27 percent, providing remarkably high levels of dry powder to fund acquisitions. During the 
same period, the median holding period for PE firms extended from five and a half years  
to nearly seven years, signaling the likelihood of increased sell-side activity in the near and 
intermediate terms. 

With growth-focused acquisitions between 2020 and 2024 accounting for 80 percent of deals—
up from 34 percent a decade ago—the urgency to replenish pipelines remains a key incentive for 
dealmaking. More than half of biopharma revenues in 2023 were generated by intellectual property 
that is set to lose exclusivity by 2027. Companies are no longer looking solely for immediate 
revenue contributors; they are targeting forward-looking innovative assets and platforms that 
can deliver sustained value over the long term. 

At the same time, industry deal premiums increased from 2020 to 2024, raising expectations  
for successful integrations and value creation. Despite high premiums, analyses of bolt-on 
transactions over the past two decades show that M&A has generated value across the industry, 
though most of the value is concentrated among 30 percent of acquirers. 

Medtech companies experienced the industry’s most active year for portfolio-shaping activity 
since 2017 and executed their second-highest number of acquisitions of more than $1 billion in the 
past decade. While a broad programmatic approach to acquiring smaller, high-growth-adjacent 
businesses remains an evergreen strategy to accelerate near-term growth, add innovation, and 
access adjacencies, many of these companies follow certain key strategies. 

First, they execute step out acquisitions that target new patient pools or technology areas. This 
approach works well for companies seeking to transform their long-term growth plans. 
Increasingly, medtech companies are moving into treating unmet-need diseases and exploring 
nascent, high-potential digital solutions. Second, they practice portfolio simplification to  
divest lower-growth or dilutive assets to improve growth and margin profiles and follow through 
on a clear strategy. Third, they execute transactions with other at-scale companies, which  
helps acquirers reset their cost bases. In these cases, effective integration is particularly critical 
for success. The greater the synergy between the two companies, the higher the likelihood  
of achieving substantial long-term operating-margin expansion.

Life-science-service companies recently gained momentum and now represent a larger share of 
deal activity than they did in the previous year. Companies in this sector are looking to acquire 
complementary offerings to provide more integrated, end-to-end solutions to their clients and to 
cover all stages of the product life cycle. In addition, these companies often consolidate smaller 
players that provide specialized services, thereby streamlining operations and competing more 
effectively in globalized markets.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Private capital
Investors’ cautious stance in  
2024 may give way to a more 
aggressive approach

Private capital firms have been active in several industries, but activity  
in technology, media, and telecommunications leads the way. And firms 
pursued fewer megadeals, opting for midsize deals more often.

46

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The industry overview

Private capital firms have experienced notable fluctuations in global deal volumes and values 
over the past several years. On average, deals in this space represented about 21 percent of  
all M&A deals over the past six years, peaking at 26 percent in 2021, spurred by postpandemic 
tailwinds and increased capital flows. Thereafter, however, deal count has decreased every  
year through 2024—dropping by 22 percent in 2022 and by another 25 percent in 2023. Private 
capital firms have also experienced an increase in buy-side activities, which reached (on average)  
60 percent of total deal value between 2022 and 2024. 

The recent decline in deal volume suggests that investors are proceeding with caution, waiting 
for greater clarity on how the market will evolve in the wake of the US election outcomes, 
changing geopolitical dynamics, surges in demand, a potential decrease in interest rates, the 
opening up of IPO markets, and a range of other external forces.

A key factor to consider, however, is the growing pressure from limited partners for disinvestments 
in older vintages. And given the availability of dry powder among private equity (PE) companies, 
there is also a push to see more new investments. In this context, the private capital market is 
poised for revitalization in the very near future.

Sector trends: TMT was most active
Private capital firms have been active in several industries over the past few years—but activity in 
the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector continues to lead the way in terms 
of deal value and volume. Between 2019 and 2024, for instance, TMT accounted for 25 to  
30 percent of deals in private capital. Other relevant sectors are global energy and materials 
(GEM), which had 10 percent of total deal value in 2024 (in line with 2019); financial services  
and insurance, which had 10 percent of total deal value in 2024 (with an increase of about nine 
percentage points since 2019); and advanced industries, which had 6 percent of total deal  
value in 2024 (at about the same level as in 2019). 

Recent trends, such as the acceleration of digital, data-driven, and technological innovation,  
and the global energy transition, seem to have influenced the concentration of investments in 
these sectors.

Regional trends: High activity in the Americas 
A look back at regional trends reveals that total deal value in the Americas increased in 2024, 
compared with 2023. The first nine months, in fact, were close to prepandemic performance.  
The Americas now account for 49 percent of total deal value globally, with the value of 
transactions in the region increasing in the past year (in both absolute and relative terms) and  
the volume of transactions growing, specifically in buyout deals. Europe, the Middle East,  
and Africa (EMEA) still are reporting significant private capital activity and account for 33 percent 
of total deal value worldwide.

47

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Opportunities for 2025—and beyond

Private capital firms, under increasing pressure from their investors to deploy their reserves of 
dry powder, could play an even more prominent role in the M&A landscape soon. 

New investment opportunities are emerging in private credit, infrastructure investments, and 
secondaries. In a continuation of 2024 trends, the acceleration of take-private deals may remain 
an attractive opportunity for private capital firms to invest their growing reserves of unallocated 
capital. Also, the potential for lower valuations (for instance, in the United States, compared with 
Europe) may promote more cross-border M&A backed by financial sponsors.

As private capital firms face more pressure from limited partners (LPs) to divest higher-vintage 
capitals and distribute attractive yields, they will need to explore creative methods for exiting and 
reimbursement. Some factors may lead to a more benign exit market—for instance, a decrease  
in interest rates, successful anchor deals, or sustained strength of the equity market—thereby 
enabling funds to reimburse high-vintage capitals and achieve the returns demanded by LPs.

And finally, new geopolitical dynamics will prompt private capital firms to redefine their roles;  
the call for new investments in sectors associated with innovation and competitiveness is already 
intensifying on both sides of the Atlantic. 

In Europe, Italian economist Mario Draghi’s European competitiveness report1 emphasizes the 
importance of boosting economic competitiveness through digital technology, energy transition, 
defense, and breakthrough innovation. Private capital can be mobilized to support investments  
in all those areas. In the United States, potential regulations aimed at accelerating innovation might 
further pave the way for new investment opportunities for private capital firms.

Navigating through the headwinds

Despite the slowdown in dealmaking in 2024, there are good reasons

many players seek to pursue innovation and growth.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?A challenging environment

When it comes to headline transactions and market-moving M&A, the healthcare industry may 
not immediately come to mind. But in the United States—as in many economies around the 
world—healthcare is a dynamo. 

In 2024, US healthcare deal activity continued to slow after its peak in 2021, with total deals 
declining roughly 30 percent year over year. Headwinds included high multiple expectations, 
given prior valuations in key sectors (for example, healthcare services and technology); continued 
margin pressure for payers and providers, which limited the funds available for acquisitions;  
and regulatory uncertainty (Exhibit 1). In this article, we assess US deal activity in 2024, identify 
important developments since 2023, and highlight key insights across leading sectors.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Several key developments were particularly prominent: 

 — Meaningful activity from care delivery businesses. Smaller physician groups continued  

to consolidate; more than 80 percent of physician-led deal activity was composed of like-for-
like transactions. Since 2019, the employment landscape for physicians has continued  
to evolve; as many as 70 percent of physicians are now employed by hospitals or corporate 
entities.1 This trend reflects a shift away from independent practice and toward larger 
organizational structures. 

In parallel, horizontal consolidation among pre-acute-care assets remained high, with key 
categories of these assets composing more than 80 percent of total pre-acute-care-led deal 
volume. Interest in outpatient behavioral health, for its part, notably increased, including 
acquisitions in demographic-specific outpatient mental health, where services tend to be 
tailored to meet particular needs.

Similarly, more than 80 percent of deals in post–acute care were horizontal consolidations; 
transactions in this area focused on home health and hospice care. These investments 
reflected broader trends toward at-home care models, which benefit from demographic 
changes, including an aging population and a growing demand for cost-effective,  
patient-centered care solutions.

 — Portfolio diversification and purposeful growth for hospitals. Approximately 40 percent of 
deal activity led by hospitals was focused on non-acute segments, including pre–acute  
care and physician practices, as health systems aimed to diversify their portfolios and act on 
growth opportunities in adjacent markets. Pre–acute care composed about 15 percent of 
hospital-led acquisitions in 2024, driven by the expansion of outpatient clinics, ambulatory 
surgery centers, and urgent care. Post-acute-care acquisitions contributed a smaller  
share of hospital-led deals—less than 5 percent of all hospital-led deals. In recent years, 
physician group acquisitions have consistently made up approximately 30 percent of 
hospital-led deal activity. In 2024, this category of hospital-led acquisitions predominantly 
focused on specialty groups, as hospitals sought to formalize partnerships across key  
service lines, such as orthopedics, neurology, and women’s health.

 — A focused approach for financial investors. Private equity (PE) funds concentrated their 
2024 investments primarily on healthcare services and technology businesses (over  
50 percent of all PE-led deal activity). Pre–acute care (such as outpatient behavioral care) 
composed an additional 10 percent share, as did physician groups. Moreover, PE increasingly 
targeted tech-driven platforms to scale portfolio companies in add-on acquisitions—
particularly those facilitating physician practices—to propel operational efficiencies, optimize 
economies of scale, and strengthen service capabilities in specialty areas.

platforms to scale portfolio companies 
in add-on acquisitions—particularly 
those facilitating physician practices—to 
propel operational efficiencies, optimize 
economies of scale, and strengthen 
service capabilities in specialty areas.

 — Consolidation for pharmacy and healthcare and technology services sectors. Consolidations 

drove deal activity across transactions led by pharmacy and healthcare services and 
technology companies, as like-for-like deals composed between 80 and 90 percent of deal 
flow in these sectors. In pharmacy businesses, more than 80 percent of deal activity was 
focused on horizontal transactions, reflecting efforts to expand networks and streamline 
distribution activities. Additionally, heightened competition from mail order and online 
pharmacies, which cater to convenience-oriented consumers and seek to meet complex 
treatment needs, has pressured traditional pharmacies to innovate or consolidate. In 
healthcare services and technology businesses, more than 80 percent of transactions  
were also like-for-like deals. Players in these sectors sought to focus on integrating 
complementary services and innovations to enhance their value propositions and  
strengthen their positions in an evolving healthcare ecosystem. 

 — A targeted approach by payers. Payers adopted a targeted approach to deals in 2024. 
Across their lines of business, they navigated EBITDA margin compression, which  
limits funds available for acquisitions. While deal activity led by payers is generally lower 
relative to other healthcare sectors, given the lower number of players on an absolute  
basis, 2024 saw particularly muted activity across most sectors. More than 50 percent of 
payer-led transactions focused on same-sector consolidation to expand care coverage  
and improve operational efficiency. Additionally, some payers were active in dealmaking in 
pre- and post-acute-care businesses (such as home health and ambulatory surgery  
centers). These businesses help to reduce the costs of care through better medication 
pricing, utilization, and adherence management.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Key changes in 2024 deal activity compared with 2023

When compared with 2023, overall US healthcare deal activity in 2024 declined, with a sharp 
drop in the absolute number of like-for-like transactions across all sectors. The steepest  
declines were in the physician and healthcare services and technology sectors—areas that have 
typically seen high deal volume. When compared with 2023, PE-led activity saw meaningful 
shifts, marked by a continued focus on healthcare services and technology deals and a notable 
reduction in transactions centered on physician groups (Exhibit 3).

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?When comparing 2024 with 2023, the most prominent insights include the following: 

 — Slowing of provider-led deal activity. While hospital-led deal activity continued to span the 
care continuum in 2024, hospital-led acquisitions across most provider segments (with  
the exception of physician assets) slowed. This decline likely reflected hospitals’ ongoing 
financial pressures and an increasingly complex regulatory landscape, which has affected 
their approach to strategic expansions. Pre- and post-acute-care deal activity also declined. 
While like-for-like transactions still composed more than 80 percent of total activity in  
both sectors, the number of these deals fell by 24 and 45 percent, respectively, relative to 
2023. Rising labor costs (driven by staffing shortages) and regulatory changes (such as,  
for example, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services payment adjustments) have pushed 
providers to focus on core operations. However, each segment sought to control costs  
in its own ways. Pre-acute-care providers increasingly invested in healthcare services and 
technology, while post-acute-care players focused on pharmacy services to better manage 
care cost and improve outcomes for aging patients. In addition, consolidation among 
physician groups slowed substantially, with more than 50 fewer like-for-like transactions— 
a drop of 39 percent from 2023. Dental consolidation stabilized but still represents  
a substantial share of total provider-led transaction volume. Specialties with high volumes  
of ambulatory procedures, such as eye care, dermatology, and orthopedics, continued  
to consolidate. 

 —  Decline of payer-led deal activity in consolidation-focused deals. Compared with 2023, 

payer-led, consolidation-focused deals fell by 29 percent, likely due to both limited payer-to-
payer transaction opportunities (that is, a limited number of potential combinations exist)  
and regulatory caution. Payers have increasingly shifted their M&A focus toward pharmacy 
businesses to address rising specialty drug costs—a major driver of healthcare spending—
while enhancing pharmacy integration, improving cost efficiencies, and delivering greater 
value to their members. Payer-led acquisitions of post-acute-care assets reflected an 
additional approach to reduce costs. 

 — Substantial declines for healthcare services and technology. Compared with 2023,  

the healthcare services and technology sectors experienced substantial declines in like-
for-like transactions. Indeed, these types of deals declined by approximately 40 percent, 
reflecting an absolute decline of more than 50 transactions compared with 2023. This 
decline might be attributed to a slowdown after recent years of heightened activity, as well 
as elevated multiples. 

 — Increases for pharmacy consolidations. By contrast, pharmacy consolidations increased by 
more than 40 percent year over year in 2024. While the magnitude is notable, it’s due in part  
to exceptional circumstances: Pharmacy-related M&A accounts for approximately 5 percent 
of overall healthcare M&A volume. The small base means that the sector is more prone to 
fluctuations within specific subsegments.

 — Pressure on PE. PE funds are holding assets for longer periods. In parallel, elevated asset 

valuations have created substantial gaps between buyer and seller expectations, hindering 
dealmaking. The hospital, physician, and post-acute-care sectors have experienced the 
sharpest relative declines, at 70 percent, 38 percent, and 35 percent, respectively. However, 
healthcare services and technology and pharmacy assets saw a meaningful increase in  
deal interest (30 and 88 percent, respectively, compared with 2023).

55

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?In the hospital sector, operational challenges such as staffing shortages, increased operational 
expenses, and financial instability drove a year-over-year decline in private equity transactions, 
as PE firms adopted a more selective approach to these investments. Moreover, rising scrutiny  
from the US Senate, culminating in a report titled Profits over patients, published by the Senate 
Budget Committee in January 2025, may have dampened excitement around PE-led activity.2

Growing interest in healthcare services and technology sectors, reflected in the opportunity to 
use tech-enabled platforms to improve operational efficiencies, integrate fragmented workflows, 
and support predictive analytics and care optimization, made these businesses attractive targets 
for buy-and-build strategies. Similarly, interest rose in the pharmacy sector—in that case, driven 
by the role these companies play in value-based care (for example, accessible preventive 
services and chronic-disease support) and the growth potential from specialty services, digital 
integration, and increasing consumer demand for localized healthcare solutions.

Outlook for 2025

Despite the slowdown in activity seen in 2024, there are good reasons to expect greater M&A 
activity in 2025 and 2026 as many players seek to pursue innovation and growth. Immediate and 
long-term trends, such as the increasing emphasis on care-at-home models, value-based 
contracting, and tech-driven platforms, underscore the industry’s commitment to enhancing 
patient outcomes and operational efficiency. Although challenges such as labor shortages  
and margin pressures persist, they also drive the potential for creative strategies and targeted 
investments that can shape a more resilient and adaptive healthcare ecosystem. Looking  
ahead, US healthcare is expected to see continued investment in digital health solutions, 
AI-driven care models, and personalized medicine as stakeholders seek to unlock efficiencies 
and improve access to care. Additionally, the growing focus on preventive care and whole- 
person health signals a shift toward long-term, sustainable healthcare strategies. As organizations 
continue to navigate these complexities, M&A will remain an important means to enable  
growth and adapt to a changing healthcare landscape.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The industry overview 

Deal activity in the travel, logistics, and infrastructure sector increased markedly in 2024 
compared with the previous year, with a total deal value of $157 billion in 2024 versus $115 billion 
in 2023. However, activity was still below prepandemic levels (with a total deal value of  
$173 billion in 2019) and substantially below peaks in 2021 and 2022. 

Similarly, the proportion of private equity (PE) deals in the sector increased—from 14 percent of 
all deals in 2023 to 22 percent in 2024—but PE activity was still well below that of previous  
years. Some PE holdings are nearing their maturity and will likely come to market in the next year 
or two; given the current interest rate environment, it will be interesting to see to what extent 
valuations will stabilize or improve.

Subsector activity and opportunities for 2025—and beyond

M&A among travel companies has been relatively soft over the past few years. The total deal 
value in 2024 was $35 billion, essentially on par with the total deal value in 2023, which was  
$37 billion. But both figures are still well below the total deal value of $65 billion in 2021. That’s 
likely because travel companies, like other businesses in this sector, have been facing high 
interest rates and inflation and a changing regulatory environment. Rather than seek out deals, 
many have been looking inward to manage costs. Our research shows that deals in the Asia–
Pacific and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) regions account for a higher share of the 
total number of travel deals than those in the United States (with 34 percent, 37 percent, and  
29 percent of deals in those regions, respectively). About 80 percent of all travel deals have been 
in the hospitality segment—albeit this includes several individual property transactions.

Travel dynamics are changing, presenting leaders with several opportunities for growth and 
transformation. Our research suggests deal sizes are likely to remain small. In the hotel segment, 
for instance, we’re seeing large players (such as Hyatt and Hilton) expand into newer brands  
or locations through bolt-on deals. Some larger deals may still be in the offing—in the case of 
market or category expansion—but the regulatory environment remains uncertain, making 
smaller plays more attractive.

At the macroeconomic level, spending on business travel is likely to continue to recover from 
recent postpandemic levels, potentially surpassing $2 trillion by 2028, according to the Global 
Business Travel Association.1 This increased spending will likely spur more deal activity as 
companies seek to keep pace with demand. Travel management companies, for instance, may 
want to expand their capabilities to better serve corporate customers. And companies across  
the travel ecosystem will likely reconsider their investments in various products and services as 
travelers—particularly younger generations—splurge more on experiences and dining and  
look to save on flights, shopping, and lodging.

And though it’s historically been an area of underinvestment, travel technology should be a core 
theme for PE and strategic investors—particularly given recent functional advancements in the 
tools and systems used to manage properties and revenue, engage in marketing and distribution, 
manage workforces, and so on.

July 2024.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Deal activity among logistics companies is on the upswing, with $98 billion in total deal value 
reported in 2024, which is higher than in 2020 but still below the $150 billion total deal value 
reported in 2021. Our research shows that 91 percent of all deals in 2024 were small ones (less 
than $1 billion), with only a few mega deals announced, and the deals have covered all the  
major market segments. 

Against this context, logistics players may be well placed to capitalize on several trends in 2025. 
For instance, based on M&A activity among the top 50 third-party logistics companies, there  
is room for consolidation—with a chance for these players to increase their scale, distribution 
networks, and access to customers in specific regions or countries. Similarly, there is still a fair 
amount of fragmentation among large logistics companies; consider that the top ten companies 
in areas such as truck brokerage, freight forwarding, and contract logistics represent only 
between 5 percent and 20 percent of their respective segments. There are opportunities, then, 
for companies to consolidate and capture a range of advantages in procurement, operations,  
and commercialization. 

Another trend that bears watching is logistics companies’ pursuit of select bolt-on acquisitions, 
with the idea of adding capabilities such as cold-chain storage and digital order fulfillment. 
Indeed, large providers now see select acquisitions as a way to leapfrog into high-margin 
segments (such as healthcare and life sciences) that have traditionally been served by  
niche companies. 

Technology-oriented deals will likely also loom large in 2025 as solutions in the transportation 
and logistics space improve significantly and as more and more start-ups develop and launch 
tools and platforms aimed at managing specific elements of the logistics value chain. Private 
investors will likely restart their acquisition engines—to a greater degree than they did in  
2022 and 2023—and take advantage of rate corrections and adjusted valuations of medium-size 
logistics providers. In particular, they are already showing strong interest in assets that provide 
them with a sound competitive position and rate stability—think specialized logistics services or 
contract logistics. 

Technology-oriented deals  
will likely loom large in 2025 as 
solutions in the transportation  
and logistics space improve 
significantly and as more and  
more start-ups develop and launch 
tools and platforms.

significantly from the previous two years. Airports accounted for about half of all transportation 
deals (18) and 78 percent of the value ($19 billion) of deal activity in this segment. A range of  
other transportation services accounted for the other 50 percent of all transportation deals and 
represented 22 percent of deal value in the segment. 

Even as activity dropped, the average size of deals in this industry segment is normalizing to 
about $670 million. The surge in deal size has been almost exclusively driven by activity in  
Asia–Pacific and EMEA countries; by contrast, deal size in North America and South America 
has remained small and stable—about $2 billion to $13 billion per year. Overall, however, 
infrastructure deals remain a domestic game, with 73 percent of all infrastructure M&A 
happening within a country’s borders. 

What’s more, in 2024, we observed PE investors getting involved in a larger share of 
infrastructure deals than they did previously (47 percent), although that figure reflects only six 
large deals—for instance, deals involving Budapest Airport, Malaysia Airport Holdings,  
Star Leasing, and Transmashholding. 

As PE investors consider prospects for 2025, a few trends are emerging that bode well for them: 
Alliances are reshuffling, trade flows have been reconfigured—and are continuing to shift— 
and transportation lines continue to have excess funds, which means there could be significant 
opportunities to invest in strategic ports and terminals. Indeed, investors can continue to leverage 
infrastructure investments to stabilize their portfolios and cash flow positions.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The industry overview 

There was a significant amount of M&A activity in the technology, media, and telecommunications 
(TMT) sector in 2024. Companies invested $698 billion in just over 1,460 TMT deals, with about  
60 percent of those deals (by value) occurring in North and South America. Large deals—or those 
greater than $10 billion in value—accounted for about one-third of all TMT deals. And, amid the 
challenges of a rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape, domestic deals accounted for 80 percent 
of all TMT mergers and acquisitions (by value).

Most of the deals in TMT—75 percent by volume and 59 percent by value—were focused  
on technology, although the average size of a technology deal in 2024 ($377 million)  
was smaller than that of the average media and telecommunications deals ($626 million and  
$1 billion, respectively). 

Software was the prime focus in most technology deals, and most of the deals above $1 billion  
in value involved private equity (PE). By contrast, infrastructure was a key theme for acquisitions  
in the telecommunications subsector, and 75 percent of the deals above $500 million in  
the media subsector were focused on visual media and on sports media rights and gaming. 

Opportunities for 2025 and beyond

Multiple trends, including increased cost pressures, the emergence of new technologies, and  
a dramatic change in the regulatory environment for deals, will likely fuel M&A growth across  
all subsectors in 2025. We also anticipate an increase in the share of carve-outs as organizations 
seek to simplify and reshape their corporate portfolios. PE players’ already strong interest  
in M&A opportunities is likely to continue—mostly in deals involving technology and software 
companies and investments in telecommunications infrastructure, but also in new-media  
assets emerging in 2025. 

Subsector activity: Technology
Our research shows that the technology subsector will continue to propel most deals in 2025, by 
both volume and value. Specifically, we expect companies and investors to focus on the following:

 — Doubling down on market leadership. Acquisitions of $5 billion in value or greater are likely 

to continue as companies build out their portfolios and double down on investments in select 
product categories to ensure that they are among the top three or four players in those 
categories. The savviest organizations will also consider divestments as a means to reshape 
portfolios and free up funds to pursue additional M&A. 

 — Pursuing capital-expenditure-fueled growth. Capital expenditures are now helping  

to drive growth across the technology sector, in a shift away from traditional R&D-driven 
strategies. This trend is particularly evident among hyperscalers that are prioritizing 
increased computing capacity over the launch of new products. In some cases, technology 
companies are even investing in power assets to support the expansion of their data  
centers, underscoring a move toward deeper vertical integration. Collectively, these 
developments are expected to continue to drive M&A activity in 2025.

66

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving? — An inflection point in AI investments. Spending related to AI has been mostly centered on the 
development of infrastructure—for example, investments in data centers and the extensive 
hardware required for AI training and inference. By contrast, investments in the software that 
allows organizations to monetize their AI infrastructure have continued to lag—until now. 
Companies have reached an inflection point; as organizations reimagine their AI strategies 
and shift their spending from pure infrastructure toward software, we anticipate their use of 
M&A to acquire essential capabilities.

 — Acquiring bolt-on capabilities. The acquisition of software products, intellectual property, 

and other capabilities—particularly the acquisition of AI expertise, coveted by large platform 
companies—will continue to account for a substantial share of M&A activity in the TMT  
sector in 2025. M&A activity will likely also rise in IT services as companies seek to acquire 
the specialized skills and domain expertise that will allow them to stay competitive and  
deliver better solutions to clients. Many of these acquisitions may be considered bolt-on 
deals, given their size. Still, the potential for growth through these smaller, focused 
acquisitions will continue to influence valuations and M&A activity across the subsector.

 — Rising presence of PE in tech. We expect another year of increased PE investments in  
the technology sector, fueled by ample dry powder and a more favorable interest rate 
environment. Our research suggests PE will stay active at the top end of M&A in the sector,  
in line with the 2024 figure, where PE was involved in three of the top ten deals (by size).  
PE will also continue to be an important player at the lower end of the deal spectrum, bolstered 
by a large backlog of aging PE-owned assets that are poised for exit.

Subsector activity: Media
Several factors will likely continue to drive deal activity in the media subsector in 2025—including 
increased top- and bottom-line cost pressures and changes in consumption patterns among 
customers. Some major deals emerged in 2024, including Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition 
of Paramount Global.1 Apart from the blockbusters, M&A activity among smaller media companies 
points to three emerging trends: 

 — Separations are the new black. Several media conglomerates, including Axel Springer, 

Comcast, Schibsted, and Vivendi, have signaled their intentions to carve out digital assets or 
legacy media to increase the stand-alone value of their portfolios or to protect those  
future-proof assets within declining portfolios. PE may be a potential outlet for some of  
the assets being carved out.

 — Consolidation will accelerate among traditional media. Traditional media is facing significant 
cost pressures. Since the first quarter of 2021, for instance, wages in European media have 
increased 15 percent, the cost of paper has increased 50 percent, and the cost of energy is 
up 100 percent. Pair those numbers with the previously mentioned changes in media 
consumption patterns and ever-increasing competitive pressures from digital players, and 
the result is more consolidation in newspaper publishing and TV broadcasting—and it’s 
happening quickly. 

1  Lucas Manfredi, “Done deal: Paramount Global sells to Skydance Media in $8 billion acquisition,” Yahoo Finance, July 7, 2024.

67

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving? — More companies will pursue creative partnerships. The emergence of streaming content 

and aggregated digital services poses a significant challenge for media companies. Some are 
pursuing creative partnerships to address—and potentially avoid—issues with fragmentation. 
RTL Deutschland and Sky Deutschland, for instance, entered a two-year partnership in 
which the free-TV player and the pay-TV broadcaster agreed to exchange rights to air various 
sports events, including German Bundesliga matches and Formula 1 races.2 More deals along 
these lines are likely to emerge as media companies seek to increase the value of their 
offerings while avoiding contractual commitments. 

Subsector activity: Telecommunications
Changes in the regulatory environment—in Belgium, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, for 
instance—are putting some limits on consolidation among traditional telecommunications 
operators; still, there will likely continue to be some focus on consolidation along with other 
critical M&A drivers, including the following:

 — Moving closer together. Where there is still space for consolidation, traditional operators will 
continue to pursue fixed–mobile and mobile–mobile deals across markets, so they can  
share the cost of network build-outs and expand their share of customer wallet. Regulators, 
for their part, are likely to impose remedies designed to maintain healthy competition  
among operators—for instance, pursuing specific commitments related to network build-outs 
or seeking divestitures of spectrum or specific assets. 

 — Hunting for new revenue sources. Traditional operators will likely continue to pursue small-
scale diversification—in areas such as security, healthcare, IT consulting, and AI—as they 
experience decreasing revenues per customer and search elsewhere for higher returns to 
supplement their core businesses. 

 — Emphasizing the core. More and more operators are selling off or shutting down noncore 

assets, or exiting noncore locations, as they seek to address revenue challenges and simplify 
their business structures.

In the telecommunications infrastructure subsector, M&A activity has been high—not surprising, 
given the rising interest in 5G technology and data centers. In fact, deals involving data centers, 
fiber networks, and mobile towers account for most of the deal value in this subsector. PE and 
sovereign-wealth funds have been important players in these deals. 

In 2025, more consolidation in this subsector is likely as competition increases and infrastructure 
players struggle to maintain the large capital outlays they need to grow. Partnerships and PE 
joint ventures will play a central role here, too, in providing the up-front investments these capital-
intensive businesses need.

Uncertainty in M&A: 
Postcards from the new 
normal 

Unprecedented shocks are affecting M&A activity and dealmaker 
behavior. Different analyses help bring uncertainty into focus—and 
suggest a range of outcomes.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Uncertainty in M&A has become the new normal. Under conditions of multiple, significant, and 
global macroeconomic shocks, companies and investors are becoming more purposeful about 
their deals. While there is still meaningful deal volume (approximately 80 to 90 percent of levels 
experienced a decade ago), we see a higher bar for ensuring value creation and a greater 
willingness to engage in alternative deal types, such as joint ventures (JVs) and alliances. The era 
of “opportunistic” deals has passed, as interest rates no longer hover near zero, disruptions  
have become constant, and uncertainties are profound and multifaceted. 

Indeed, neither the scope nor the depth of uncertainties in M&A can be captured by a single, 
simple depiction. Instead, they can best be understood by examining them through multiple 
lenses that offer different and, in the aggregate, complementary snapshots—or what we call 
postcards—of the new normal (see sidebar, “Six postcards, six takeaways”). Taken together,  
these postcards offer insight into the shifts of the past few years and the challenges that 
dealmakers now confront. They also suggest a range of outcomes going forward, both  
for defense-minded strategies and potentially bolder moves. 

Postcards across dimensions

There are numerous lenses through which one can examine M&A dynamics. Among the most 
revealing, we found, are (1) historical macroeconomic comparisons; (2) analyses of key financial 
metrics, including deal counts, valuations, cost of funding, and numbers of IPOs; (3) geographical 
differences (including, importantly, M&A across borders and continents); (4) size of deal synergies; 
(5) frequency of alternative transactions (such as alliances and JVs); and (6) developments 
specific to private investors, particularly private equity (PE) funds. 

Six postcards, six takeaways

Assessing M&A uncertainty across different perspectives requires a wide range of analyses—and 
risks not only losing the forest for the trees but falling deep into the undergrowth. To keep a clear sight 
line of the six postcards and their primary takeaways, we can summarize them as follows:

 — Deal synergies. Announced synergies in 
2024 were well above historical averages.

 — Alternative deal types. Structures such as 

joint ventures and alliances are back in vogue.

 — Private equity. Private equity remained largely 
on the sidelines in 2024, but conditions are 
ripening for more dealmaking.

 — Historical macroeconomic comparisons.  
The year 2024 followed a pattern similar  
to that of other periods of recovery and likely 
reflected uncertainties related to the US 
presidential election year.

 — Deal metrics. Deal multiples are down  
more than seven turns amid the current 
uncertainties, far exceeding multiple 
compression during prior downturns.

 — Cross-border M&A. Companies pivoted to 
gain access to the Americas, expecting 
growth exposure, and paid a premium for  
this access.

71

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Historical macroeconomic comparisons 
Our first snapshot is a historical macroeconomic comparison—that is, a look at what’s different 
and what’s similar between present macroeconomic developments and previous ones (Exhibit 1). 

The key takeaway from this postcard? The year 2024 followed a pattern similar to many other 
macroshock periods of recovery and, though deal prices on a real basis have been broadly 
declining for about a decade, likely also reflected uncertainties related to the US presidential 
election year (Exhibit 2).

It’s tempting to call the past few years a “perfect storm.” But doing so suggests that the recent 
past represented a one-off happenstance that is now behind us and that more stable, predictable 
times are ahead. In fact, and more likely, a combination of forces and shocks is likely to endure 
through the foreseeable future. 

M&A activity has always varied to some extent, of course, and downturns aren’t new; though 
each decline has been different, they share important commonalities. What’s similar about 
current developments compared with prior developments? Most prominently, the decreases in 
dealmaking we see today remind us of the oil shocks of the early 1970s—a combination of  
events and forces (an energy crisis, a severe strain on supply, the resurgence of inflation, rising 
geopolitical tensions, and a deceleration in productivity in developed markets) that wasn’t 
contained within a single or few industries and geographies. 

That’s unusual. While most of the other past downturns (such as the Asian financial crisis in 1997, 
the dot-com bubble in 2000, and the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009) were largely 
contained within specific regions or sectors, the pandemic and postpandemic shocks that

dealmakers now confront reverberate across sectors and geographies. Moreover, today’s 
uncertainties are marked by a combination of changes happening at approximately the same 
time—even if those shifts don’t dominate the headlines. 

Consider regulation: The rules that govern M&A within and across regions are undergoing some 
of their most consequential changes in decades. To take one prominent example, the United 
States experienced a dramatic spike in regulatory challenges to transactions, and new rules are 
going into effect that will substantially alter filing requirements—though whether those rules will 
endure is itself uncertain, since the nature and extent of changes between the Biden and second 
Trump administrations are yet to be determined. 

73

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving? 
Or consider capital flows: In Europe, foreign direct investment is declining substantially in some of 
the region’s largest economies. Now, changes to tariff policy threaten to upset global markets 
even further. Nor, of course, are these dynamics the only sources of uncertainty. Strains on global 
supply chains are pronounced, geopolitical tensions are rising, and carbon constraints are 
becoming more urgent. The shocks are far more varied and, in some respects, much more intense 
than in previous crises (Exhibit 3).

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Deal metrics
Historical comparisons, while helpful, reveal only part of the story. Another critical lens is 
financial and deal metrics. Start with deal volume: The number of deals in recent years  
has decreased in the aggregate, but aggregate decline in deal flow is largely a function of deal 
counts, which are falling amid uncertainty. 

The key takeaway from this postcard? Deal multiples are down more than seven turns amid the 
current uncertainties, far exceeding multiple compression during prior downturns. While overall 
deal multiples and top-quartile multiples are currently within historical averages, the decline  
in the past few years is stark—and perhaps a reflection on the frothy median deal multiples seen 
early in the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Deal multiples from 2021 to 2024 were slightly above the average of the second quartile of  
the past 25 years and slightly higher than multiples in prior, recent crises. But the data are not 
sufficient to identify a clear trajectory. A closer analysis reveals that M&A activity typically falls  
over time in the wake of economic shocks. Deals that had already been in the pipeline typically 
are completed, but new deal flow is constrained—hence the lag. Moreover, macroeconomic 
challenges are persisting. Customer sentiment is the lowest it has been in decades. In addition, 
the days of cheap funding that had marked economies before the COVID-19 pandemic are  
over, at least for the foreseeable future. For most of the 2020s, the cost of funding has been 
fluctuating, sometimes wildly, and the volatility is presenting a significant challenge to M&A. 
Finally—and not surprisingly, amid roiling uncertainty and shocks to capital markets worldwide—
the number of IPOs has decreased sharply (Exhibit 4).

As of mid-November 2024, P/E multiples reached 35 times compared with less than 25 times in 
early 2022, and multiples of EBITDA to enterprise value climbed about 10 percent since the start 
of 2023. It’s important to note that these observations represent a global aggregate; different 
industries reflect varied dynamics, as do different geographies (and cross-border transactions) 
and categories of dealmakers (that is, financial versus corporate). These analyses, among  
others, are presented in more detail below. 

The number of deals in recent years  
has decreased in the aggregate, but 
aggregate decline in deal flow is largely 
a function of deal counts, which are 
falling amid uncertainty.

Cross-border M&A
The key takeaway from this postcard? Companies pivoted hard to gain access to the Americas, 
expecting growth exposure, and paid a premium for this access.

It would be reasonable to expect that uncertainty has had a similar, downward effect on deals 
across borders. Yet surprisingly, that’s not the case (Exhibit 5).

We define cross-border M&A in two ways: deals across borders but within the same continent 
(for example, a company based in France acquiring a target in Germany) and deals that span 
continents (such as a US company acquiring a Netherlands-based business). With respect to both 
categories, cross-border M&A has remained steady despite global uncertainty, with roughly

25 percent of deal value being cross-border. Indeed, valuations for individual cross-border deals 
are increasing. The reasons are largely case-specific; for example, some companies have an 
immediate need to reposition their supply chains and secure beachheads in markets (especially 
with pending supply chain or tariff barriers), while others continually track to where the growth 
is—including new businesses and markets. 

Drilling down further, we found that approximately 60 percent of intercontinental deal volume for 
deals larger than $500 million came from transactions between EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, 
and Africa) and the Americas, with the buyers and sellers almost evenly distributed between  
the two regions. That’s nearly double the size of the next largest category, Asia–Pacific (APAC) 
and Americas deals, which, at 26 percent, also split evenly between those two regions in terms  
of where the funds were flowing. The smallest category, APAC–EMEA deals (13 percent), was half 
the size of APAC–Americas deals; in that case, APAC initiated the larger share of intercontinental 
funding (8 percent versus 5 percent), though both are growing rapidly. 

To recognize today’s new normal, it’s important to remember the key, counterintuitive nuance: 
Cross-border M&A is trending up, and cross-border deals are bringing higher valuations.  
These dynamics run decidedly counter to declining or flat trend lines within most individual 
countries and regions.

77

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Deal synergies 
The takeaway from this postcard? Announced synergies in 2024 were well above historical 
averages. This reflects bullishness on cost, capital, and revenue, but also likely a need to justify 
premiums in an uncertain environment.

One might expect that massive uncertainties would have a negative effect on the size of deal 
synergies. After all, forces in flux could (and, one would expect, should) present a headwind for 
capturing postclosing value. Yet here again, closer analyses reveal surprises. Following the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of M&A transactions announcing cost or revenue synergies 
(or both) decreased, particularly for revenues. But for transactions that did announce synergies, 
on either or both the revenue and cost sides, the size of synergies increased significantly as  
a percentage of transaction value (Exhibit 6). We observe, moreover, that realized synergies are 
often considerably higher than what has been announced and consider not only combinational 
cost synergies but also sales and capital synergies. 

Today, cost synergies are nearly double 2015 levels, and revenue synergies have, remarkably, 
risen eightfold over the same period. These clear, positive trends are hardly the indication of a 
decidedly down market. Instead, this postcard presents a more nuanced perspective of the 
current, uncertain new normal, with several forces at work. For example, because of pervasive 
uncertainty, many boards require more convincing for M&A and green-light only those deals  
that have more significant synergy potential or are less likely to involve prolonged and potentially 
costly legal review. It also indicates more proficient corporate acquirers, able to commit to

value creation envelope will be needed to meet the internal rate of return requirements of 
acquirers. No single or simple explanation fits every case; complexities leave open a fan of 
outcomes for deals to succeed, fail, or (for now) stay in neutral. 

Alternative deal types 
The takeaway from this postcard? Alternative deal structures, particularly JVs and alliances, are 
back in vogue, reflecting earlier-stage acquisitions and a desire to access functional capabilities 
in developing areas such as artificial intelligence (Exhibit 7).

The current M&A environment also reflects a new normal in alternative deal types. The share  
of JVs and alliances has settled at a higher percentage compared with the period between 2004 
and 2017. The rationale for alternative deal types can be particularly compelling in uncertain 
times; these structures allow dealmakers to potentially reduce dependencies on interest rate 
fluctuations and ride out a funding crunch until interest rates subside and then stabilize. 
Moreover, the share of minority investments has increased following recent shocks (for example, 
in 2020, 2022, and 2023). That dynamic, too, is consistent with uncertainty, as acquirers seek  
to adjust for funding gaps, decrease risk, and address potential regulatory concerns.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Private equity
The takeaway from this postcard? Private equity (PE) remained largely on the sidelines in 2024. 
But as the length of time that financial buyers are holding businesses is reaching historical  
highs, PE funds are holding substantial levels of dry powder—and their share of deals is below 
historical highs (Exhibit 8). Those dynamics suggest increased pressure on PE firms to engage  
in more dealmaking.

Because M&A is driven by strategic and financial dealmakers, it’s helpful to disaggregate  
the two. Turning the lens on private investors reveals that they currently have an abundance of  
dry powder. Multiple PE funds face a defined timetable, an increasing pressure to exit, and  
an urgent imperative to deliver higher investor returns. After the share of PE transactions peaked 
in 2021 (27 percent of total deal volume), investors have been pushing for deals, even when  
that could lead to potential “must sell” situations. 

For more than two decades, private investors’ share of all M&A deals has run between 12 and 
 22 percent of total deal volume, and because that percentage is a function not just of their own 
dealmaking activity but also those of corporate dealmakers as well, it’s uncertain whether the 
recent trajectory since 2014 will plateau at the lower end of that range, return to the higher end, 
or perhaps set new highs (or even lows). PE’s overall share of M&A activity nudged slightly 
upward in 2024 compared with 2023 (15 percent of deals worldwide in excess of $25 million,  
one percentage point higher than 2023, and two percentage points lower than 2022). These 
levels, too, are a postcard from today’s uncertainty.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Assessing a range of outcomes 

Dealmakers, confronted with this new normal, can pursue a range of outcomes. We observe  
that many companies are taking more defense-minded actions for M&A. That approach is 
certainly understandable, given considerable unpredictability. Yet uncertainty also presents 
unique opportunities, and a more offense-minded approach could be highly attractive for  
those who dare.

Purpose, not opportunism 
Companies and private investors are adopting more cautious strategies to protect capital  
and are slowing down M&A activities across the deal life cycle. Several key themes are 
particularly evident. 

First, we’re seeing a more limited appetite for risk. This is particularly (but not solely) the case  
for industries that are more exposed to exogenous factors such as election outcomes and 
climate change. Second, most dealmakers are taking a selective and cautious approach. While 
programmatic acquirers have maintained their acquisition pace—and demonstrated the resilience 
that allows them to better source deals, optimize organizational structures in integrations, and 
demonstrate greater success in retaining key talent—a large majority of acquirers are pumping 
the brakes on the number of deals they initiate and scrutinizing those under current consideration. 
Opportunistic dealmaking of the last decade has decreased, and more purposeful deals (with 
rationales that seek to ensure a clear fit with a defined strategy) now mark the M&A landscape 
(Exhibit 9).

Dealmakers are seeking to make more holistic deal assessments, particularly during the due 
diligence phase. They are conducting rigorous analyses to improve the confidence level of sellers 
and buyers alike and are committing to ensuring that each deal meets clearly defined strategic 
criteria. They’re also seeking to maintain their focus through the integration phase to capture 
synergies more quickly, particularly on the cost side, amid rising uncertainty. 

The implications of their more deliberate approach are reflected in expectations of future M&A 
activity. The dealmakers we survey express that they expect to do fewer deals. 

Opportunities amid uncertainty 
It’s understandable that intense uncertainty would lead dealmakers to adopt a more defensive 
posture. Yet the new normal offers new opportunities for those who adopt a bolder approach.  
A less active deal market allows them to take advantage of richer pipelines; buyers that maintain 
their commitment to M&A will have fewer contenders for targets and can achieve more value-
accretive deals. In particular, they can be more proactive about potential deals with private 
investors facing pressure to sell assets held for longer holding times—and those on the lookout 
to buy as their dry powder increases. Dealmakers can also take advantage of new realities in 
creative deal structuring, using JVs and alliances to enable transactions in a context where more 
attractive funding may not be imminent. Ideally, too, they can capture higher synergy values as 
they put their customized playbooks into action. 

Finally, it’s worth noting that, historically, companies that take a programmatic approach to deals 
are more likely in the aggregate to create value than companies that practice selective dealmaking, 
pursue large deals, or primarily pursue organic growth. Indeed, their success across several 
metrics has been particularly evident amid recent uncertainty. For one, they’ve demonstrated 
greater resilience, besting competitors by about ten percentage points in 2023 in aligning  
or even exceeding the number of deals articulated in their yearly strategic plan. Moreover, 
programmatic acquirers are winning across the deal cycle. Compared with 2021, dealmakers 
reported that they were markedly more likely in 2023 to hew to M&A playbooks for deal  
sourcing and due diligence, leverage integration to optimize organizational structures, and  
retain talent critical for sustaining a competitive advantage. 

Uncertainty in M&A has indeed become the new normal. With interest rates no longer near zero, 
an array of macroeconomic shocks reverberating worldwide, and extraordinary unpredictability  
in regulations, geopolitics, and other key dimensions, dealmakers have become more purposeful 
and less opportunistic. There is a higher bar for delivering value creation, and an increased 
willingness to engage in more complex deal structuring. Yet purposeful M&A pays off, with higher 
excess TSR compared with other approaches. There are also no-regret actions that both 
offense-minded and cautious acquirers are deploying to create more value. Here, too, a full 
appreciation of the challenges and opportunities requires nuance, perspective, and  
a varied range of insights.

separations a competitive 
difference-maker

Companies that are effective at separations can significantly outperform 
their peers. Our latest survey highlights the opportunities, and 
complexities, of achieving a successful separation.

by Andy West, Anna Mattsson, and Jamie Koenig
with Anika Becker

83

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Every business has a best owner, which may—or may not—be your company. But recognizing 
that it’s time for a separation (which we define as spin-offs, split-offs, carve-outs, and other sales 
of businesses in a company’s portfolio) and actually executing separations effectively are very 
different propositions. Successful companies not only understand the separation imperative, but 
they also anticipate the challenges involved and take practical steps to meet them. As a result, 
they tend to create more value for a broader range of stakeholders.

How do they do it?

To learn more, we surveyed a broad range of experienced leaders and practitioners across  
a range of industries, geographies, and company sizes. We asked hard questions and received 
frank, thoughtful answers. To a large extent, the responses confirmed many long-held principles 
about separations.1 But they also revealed a few surprises. In this article, we’ll share the most 
compelling lessons.

The key findings

The survey found critical differences between programmatic dealmakers and companies that 
take different approaches to M&A. It also highlighted how important speed can be to an effective 
separation. In addition, the survey revealed that separations can be a lot more difficult to execute 
than they may initially appear—even for sellers that are determined to just “sell and forget,” 
intending to let the buyer sort details out.

Successful companies not only 
understand the separation 
imperative, but they also anticipate 
the challenges involved and  
take practical steps to meet them.  
As a result, they tend to create  
more value for a broader range  
of stakeholders.

1   We interviewed a diverse set of 83 separation experts comprising C-suite leaders as well as functional and project leaders from 

various industries. The survey was conducted in May 2024.

84

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Active management wins
Companies that regularly refresh their business portfolio, our survey found, reported better 
outcomes compared with those that undertook only a single separation. This underscores the 
value of accumulated experience and is consistent with our historical research. Moreover, 
respondents whose companies took a programmatic approach to deals managed to achieve at 
least partial success in their separation objectives, whereas 17 percent of nonprogrammatic 
dealmakers did not meet their goals. Active dealmakers reported that they maintained better 
control over resource limits. This indicates that these companies are more adept at balancing 
speed and value creation, as well as accurately gauging the resources needed for successful 
separations (Exhibit 1).

Interestingly, survey respondents from companies that conducted only one separation during  
the past three years reported that their companies are less likely to engage in further separations 
in the next few years (Exhibit 2). However, this excludes external factors potentially fueling 
separations, such as an activist campaign.

Speed matters
Speed matters for the success of a separation. Prior analysis of spin-offs, for example, shows 
that companies that closed within seven months of a spin-off announcement had a combined 
positive three-year median excess TSR of 1.8 percent, while companies that took 19 months or 
longer to close generated excess TSRs of −19.1 percent. Companies that closed within eight to 12 
months and 13 to 18 months of the separation announcement had excess TSRs of −0.8 percent 
and −4.3 percent, respectively.

Board deliberations can be a critical source of delay across separation categories. Our survey 
showed that only 23 percent of separations occurred without board-related delays. Delays in board 
decisions are strongly correlated with broader project setbacks. Survey participants shared that 
when board decisions are delayed, 55 percent of separations wind up being delayed as well, 
compared with just 11 percent when board decisions are timely. Strikingly, board-induced delays 
often lead to resource overruns; 59 percent of survey respondents reported cost overruns, 
compared with 26 percent who reported overruns when there were no board delays (Exhibit 3). 
These findings underscore the importance of early board clarity for successful separations.

A closer examination of board hesitation reveals several key concerns. The most frequently 
mentioned issues include valuation concerns of the involved assets, followed by the timing of the 
separation in relation to market conditions, sunk costs in the assets to be separated, and 
potential negative impact on the remainder of the company. These diverse concerns highlight the 
complexity of both internal and external perspectives that the board must consider. To ensure a

successful separation, these issues should be addressed early and directly, with clear, data-
driven arguments and thorough planning. Only then can the board make an informed decision.

Consider the case of a European chemical company, ChemCo, which attempted to separate its 
commodity and specialty businesses. Although the executive board quickly supported the move, 
the supervisory board hesitated due to concerns about high “dis-synergy” costs and potential 
effects on employees. It was only after presenting detailed analyses and directly addressing the 
supervisory board’s concerns that the company could proceed with the separation. However,  
this process delayed the separation by several months, ultimately resulting in the withdrawal of 
interest by a potential buyer. As a result, ChemCo in its entirety became the target of a hostile 
takeover, as opposed to a strategically managed separation with ChemCo in control.

Transitions can be harder than they first appear
For many sellers, it’s tempting to approach separations as “sell and forget.” Yet that approach 
often fails to maximize value creation, for seller and target alike. It’s hardly a given that both 
NewCo and RemainCo will outperform their peers.2 Separations are complex, and success often 
hinges on the effectiveness of preclose activities in laying a solid foundation for both companies. 
Navigating the often-opposing interests of both sides is crucial for a smooth transition. It may 
even be said that separations are like amicable divorces—at least until sticking points materialize.

manage these transitions effectively and avoid common pitfalls.

Our recent survey highlights the pressing issues companies face during separations, and the 
most frequent sticking points. Notably, 42 percent of survey participants reported that they 
struggled with the duration and pricing of transitional service agreements (TSAs). This includes a 
lack of clarity on which TSAs are needed due to the separation not being far enough along, 
service levels not being clearly defined, or differing views on the cost of services in the newly 
transactional relationship.

However, TSAs were not the only reported sticking point in transactions (Exhibit 4). Significant 
numbers of respondents also faced challenges with talent allocation, technology architecture, 
and target forecasts and business plans. The wide range of issues underscores the challenging 
discussions between RemainCo and NewCo, which often must be proactively managed for a 
successful transition.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?A deeper dive into the two biggest sticking points—TSAs and talent allocation—provides  
more color.

Separation-related agreements. TSAs and long-term agreements (LTAs) are often essential  
for ensuring business continuity and facilitating a smooth separation for both RemainCo  
and NewCo during transitions. TSAs can provide additional flexibility, especially when the 
transaction outcome is uncertain or when there isn’t enough time to fully establish the target’s 
new operating model.

The separation survey highlights that one of the most prevalent challenges between RemainCo 
and NewCo is negotiating TSAs, with 42 percent of survey respondents identifying it as  
a top three issue (Exhibit 5). This difficulty stems from the newly transactional nature of the 
relationship, making it complex to negotiate the scope, pricing, and governance of TSAs—issues 
encountered by four out of five survey respondents in their last separation.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?In divestitures, some employees might 
feel underappreciated. Effective  
leaders credibly frame the separation  
as a chance for new opportunities  
for all employees, not just those rated  
in the top 5 percent of performance.

The challenge intensifies when LTAs need to be negotiated, as they bind the separated 
companies together for a longer period. Despite this complexity, LTAs are frequently used, 
particularly in the form of commercial agreements (34 percent) and supply agreements  
(23 percent). Only 39 percent of experts reported not using any LTAs in their last separation. 
Given that these agreements are long-lasting and will be established between two soon- 
to-be independent entities, it is crucial to negotiate them with the same rigor as one would  
with any other third-party agreement.

While TSAs and LTAs can be critical for maintaining business continuity, they often present 
significant negotiation challenges and may impede the full potential of transformation. Ideally, 
reliance on these agreements should be minimized. However, if they are unavoidable, it is 
imperative to negotiate them at arm’s length to ensure fairness and efficacy.

Talent allocation. Talent matters—even if it is leaving. Both the seller and acquirer want “A-team” 
employees to ensure that they are set up for success. However, as soon as talented personnel 
have been identified and allocated between RemainCo and NewCo, the question is how to retain 
and even excite high-potential employees during the separation. Our survey suggests that 
NewCos benefit from talent retention mechanisms; half of NewCos with such mechanisms in 
place reported that they met or exceeded their objectives, compared with just one-quarter  
of those without such mechanisms. From our experience, this is often the case in divestitures, 
where some employees might feel underappreciated. Effective leaders credibly frame the 
separation as a chance for new opportunities for all employees, not just those rated in the top 5 
percent of performance.

The survey highlights just how central talent is to a deal’s success. More than 80 percent of 
respondents indicated they had at least one form of talent retention in place, though with greater 
emphasis on NewCo than on RemainCo. The most common levers for talent were monetary

opportunities for a greater leadership role. Survey responses were similar for both RemainCo and 
NewCo in this regard, except for acknowledgment for the separation effort and salary reviews 
(Exhibit 6).

Survey responses also strongly suggest that talent retention programs can significantly increase 
the chance of NewCo meeting or exceeding its objectives. RemainCo is clearly affected, too, 
though the effect appears to be more limited.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Achieving operational excellence

Taken together, survey responses support our own broader observations—separations should be 
part of a well-considered strategy, but creating value from separations takes work. Companies that 
adopt a programmatic approach to M&A tend to outperform their counterparts, achieving higher 
excess TSR and demonstrating the value of accumulated experience. The survey underscores the 
importance of timely board decisions, as delays often lead to broader project setbacks and 
resource overruns. Addressing board concerns early with data-driven arguments is crucial for  
a successful separation. As one survey respondent shared, “We wished we would have  
moved faster.”

The complexities identified by survey respondents highlight several critical insights for 
companies that seek to achieve a successful separation:

 — Proactive management is essential. The potential for conflict among the parties is real, even 
when separations begin amicably. Without careful and strategic oversight, these negotiations 
can quickly become contentious, jeopardizing the success of the separation.

 — Strategic use of TSAs. Companies often rely on TSAs to ensure that operations are not 

interrupted after a deal has closed. However, these agreements should be used as tools, not 
crutches. Minimizing TSAs with built-in time limits can help address stranded costs and 
promote self-sufficiency. Moreover, since TSAs are more likely to be needed in cases with 
greater entanglements, the likelihood of stranded costs is also likely to be higher.  
Although TSAs are not the reason for these costs, they can delay the timely addressing  
of stranded costs.

 — Comprehensive planning and execution. Effective separation management requires  

a detailed road map, rigorous planning, and clear communication. This includes addressing 
talent allocation, technology architecture, and business forecasts to ensure both RemainCo 
and NewCo can operate independently and successfully from day one.

Delays often lead to broader project 
setbacks and resource overruns. 
Addressing board concerns early with 
data-driven arguments is crucial for  
a successful separation.

92

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving? — Proactive risk management to secure valuation. Judicious forethought and proactive 
management can create conditions that add up to a higher valuation and propel better 
business outcomes. Identifying potential disruptions and mitigating risks, such as operational 
disruptions and technology disentanglement, are crucial for maintaining transaction value.

 — Leadership and orchestration. Successful separation programs require engagement  

and orchestration across multiple workstreams. A steering committee provides strategic 
direction, while the separation management office orchestrates and drives separation  
design, planning, and implementation across workstreams. This structured approach ensures  
that all aspects of the separation are meticulously planned and executed with a value  
creation mindset.

Successful separations don’t happen by chance. Our recent survey demonstrates that thoughtful 
companies not only make hard strategic choices to commit to separations; they also then  
follow through on execution—addressing potential disruptions, mitigating risks through detailed 
planning and coordination, and creating conditions that encourage better outcomes. As 
economic conditions continue to rapidly change, value-creating separations should be more 
important than ever.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Dealmaking through 
challenges: Lessons from 
the automotive industry

Sometimes, M&A can pose particularly difficult challenges. The automotive 
industry offers creative examples of how deals can still get done. 

by Paul Küderli and Russell Hensley
with Fabian Hofmann 

94

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?There has always been an elemental symmetry to M&A: A seller concludes that a business or 
asset does not fit its enterprise portfolio, and a natural buyer recognizes that the same target is a 
strategic match. Put simply, there’s a buyer for every seller, or so the logic goes. 

However, the ideal does not always meet the reality. Despite a recent increase in M&A activity 
across many sectors during 2024 (including a first-half increase in deal value that was 22 percent 
higher than the corresponding first six months of 2023), some industries face challenges that 
can’t be addressed by a traditional, straightforward pairing of a seller with an obvious buyer—or, 
it may seem, with any acquirer at all. This is particularly so in the following cases: in highly 
competitive, low-margin market segments; when competition is highly cyclical and cash  
intense; when a sector may be exposed to “sunset” technologies; or when business lines have 
limited product differentiation. Companies may also be compelled to sell under suboptimal 
circumstances, such as complying with regulatory conditions to close a deal, which may result  
in a reduced price. 

Many of these challenges are confronted by sectors globally. They are particularly evident in the 
automotive industry. Not surprisingly, automotive M&A activity hit a 20-year low in 2023—and 
hasn’t meaningfully bounced back (Exhibit 1). Looking at advanced industries more broadly, the 
sector’s share in global M&A deal value decreased from a peak of 12 percent in 2020 to only  
5 percent in the first half of 2024. This low activity level is fueled in particular by tectonic change 
in the sector, not least the rise of Chinese OEMs and the global transition to battery electric 
vehicles (BEVs).

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The longer a company waits to move 
forward on a deal, the more difficult 
the transaction might be or the 
smaller the window of opportunity 
may become.

And yet, for all the headwinds, deals and business combinations still do get done in the automotive 
industry—often in highly creative ways. In many cases, the solutions offer valuable lessons to 
nonautomotive companies across sectors and regions. They demonstrate, too, that it’s best to 
act sooner; the longer a company waits to move forward on a deal, the more difficult a transaction 
might be or the smaller the window of opportunity may become. In this article, we explore the 
dynamics of doing a deal under challenging circumstances and highlight innovative approaches 
that dealmakers in the automotive ecosystem—and beyond—are taking.

Automotive uncertainty: A template for challenging M&A conditions 

For more than a century, the automotive industry has been a dynamo for local and global 
economies. That’s still the case today, and the mobility ecosystem will remain essential in the 
decades ahead. 

Yet beneath the surface, the automotive industry is experiencing tectonic change. Some shifts 
are so evident that they’re already redefining how humans think about and interact with 
automobiles. Consider, among other examples, the disruptions brought about in recent years by 
ride-hailing applications, the decline of licensed drivers in some major economies, and the 
massive digitization of automobiles: In fact, a decade ago, the number of lines of software code  
in the average high-end car surpassed the number in a jumbo jet—by a factor of seven.1

Another major shift is the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), a development that augurs both opportunity 
and uncertainty. Part of the unpredictability stems from shifting regulations, including but not 
limited to positions on BEV subsidies, internal combustion engine (ICE) phaseouts, and evolving 
emissions rules. A related dynamic is geopolitical: Automakers from regions such as North 
America have been losing about one point of market share per year to OEMs from overseas over 
the past two decades. Tariff and trade rules may also be in for significant turbulence.

Quarterly, February 23, 2019.

96

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Challenging dynamics are reflected in low valuation multiples. Today, many automotive companies 
also have high exposure to sunset assets—products and technologies with a limited lifetime and  
a negative growth outlook. Indeed, while the median 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple 
for global top 5,000 companies recently reached a factor of 17 times earnings (Exhibit 2), 
multiples are approximately eight times earnings for those automotive companies with a portfolio 
focused on ICE-related components.

It’s not surprising, therefore, that traditional corporate buyers in automotive are expressing  
a limited appetite for acquisitions, given their own needs for transformation. Cash reserves for 
many of these players, even beyond incumbent OEMs, are relatively lower, and challenges in 
operating performance make targets less attractive. Financial investors, such as private equity 
funds, are also dialing back their interest in automotive acquisitions, with the exception of  
a small number of funds that are focused on restructurings; this decline is evident not only with 
respect to ICE-related assets but also for assets focused on EVs.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Getting creative about dealmaking

For the many automotive companies that seek to divest businesses or assets to strengthen their 
balance sheets, improve financial performance going forward, and reduce exposure to certain 
segments, dealmaking has proved particularly challenging. Sellers need buyers, but at present, in 
the automotive sector, the former outstrips the latter. Yet deals are still getting done, and not just 
by reducing prices. Effective dealmakers are getting creative by taking key practical steps. 

Expand the universe of potential buyers
It’s understandable that sellers would envision that a potential buyer would come from a pool  
of current competitors—and not without reason, as these players could more easily capture 
efficiencies and instantly boost market share. But when competitors aren’t buying, dealmakers 
can expand the universe of potential acquirers beyond the usual suspects. For example, automotive 
companies in Europe and the United States are looking beyond their home geographies or  
near neighbors toward potential buyers in India, the Middle East, and Greater China. They can 
also expand beyond traditional industry players to identify deal partners with complementary 
capabilities, which can result in substantial synergies. For instance, one Europe-based 
automotive supplier recently sold a 50 percent stake in one of its assembly businesses to an 
Asia-based electronics manufacturer. The new venture is designed to take advantage of 
expansion opportunities for a global market.

Of course, not every pairing will fit so fortuitously, particularly if the seller wishes to set the target 
price within a recent historical range. If (as a thought example) the target price were $1, the 
universe of potential buyers would obviously be much larger. Clearly, sellers should not seek to 
slash asking prices just for the sake of expanding the number of potential buyers. Instead, they 
should be thoughtful about what a target’s intrinsic value actually is. Because of a shift in 
competitive dynamics and technologies, the target may be a “melting ice cube” or what academics 
might term a “cash cow”—a declining business, asset, or product that continues to produce 
positive cash flow but is unmistakably trending down and which the buyer should manage for 

When competitors aren’t buying, 
dealmakers can expand the universe of 
potential acquirers beyond traditional 
industry players to identify deal 
partners with complementary 
capabilities, which can result in 
substantial synergies.

98

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?decline. When sellers are frank in that assessment, they can be more thoughtful in identifying 
financial buyers whose value proposition is to better manage the decline—even if that means, to 
continue the analogy, simply that the ice cube would melt more slowly. 

Transform before transacting
Another potential path is transformation. Changes should go beyond surface-level touch-ups.  
A transformation can unlock the potential for significant value creation, enhancing a business’s 
competitive edge by integrating new technologies and reimagining business strategies when  
the target becomes part of a different organization. This approach not only maximizes growth 
opportunities but also significantly improves core operations and talent development. The 
initiative can lead to improved efficiency, better customer experiences, and stronger financial 
performance—a more attractive target.

In the automotive ecosystem, effective dealmakers generate clear proof points and establish 
track records of improved positioning and operating performance to showcase the target’s 
potential. For example, suppliers use full or focused transformations to strengthen their 
connections with OEMs that are considered “winners of the future.” Other players, including 
OEMs, can achieve tangible results by optimizing their manufacturing footprint, reducing  
capital expenditures needed, and improving net working capital efficiency.

Tell a more tailored story
Sometimes, obstacles go beyond target performance and are fundamentally a challenge of 
communication. Not every deal story resonates with every buyer. Different buyers have different 
needs and strategies; a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work as a general matter. When  
it comes to sunset technologies or competitively challenged markets specifically, the need for  
a highly tailored story becomes even more acute.

For example, for European or US players, a narrative for Indian or Chinese buyers may resonate 
more if it focuses on market entry. A universe of buyers, including financial acquirers, may  
be particularly drawn to a seller’s connections with winners of the future, cash conversion, and 
growth credibility for financial investors. For strategic investors, a more compelling deal story 
would highlight customer and portfolio complementarity and technology advancement. And as 
discussed, yet other buyers may actively seek out businesses that are in decline; these buyers 
have a mandate to seek out those very targets. 

Ultimately, a deal thesis comes down to value maximization. Across sectors, sellers that develop  
a transparent and compelling narrative clearly explain how value drivers link to cash flow. This 
calls for providing detailed insights into a target’s strategy, competitive advantages, and operating 
skills. Companies that effectively manage their business portfolios rightly treat prospective 
buyers as sophisticated thought partners and are transparent about both successes and challenges. 
Depending upon the buyer audience, incorporating environmental, social, and governance 
factors beyond just carbon emissions can also be compelling.

Get proactive on alternative financing
Sellers can further expand the number of potential buyers by utilizing alternative financing 
methods such as earn outs, seller financing, and stock swaps. These methods help mitigate 
valuation volatility and liquidity challenges, making transactions more feasible for a broader 
range of buyers.

99

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Sellers can expand the number of 
potential buyers by utilizing alternative 
financing methods such as earn outs, 
seller financing, and stock swaps.

Earn outs allow part of the purchase price to be contingent on the future performance of the 
acquired business, reducing up-front costs and providing upside potential for sellers while 
offering downside protection for buyers; while its limits have come under closer scrutiny in recent 
months, particularly in the United States, clear contractual language can still make this option  
a powerful enabler. Seller financing involves the seller providing a loan to the buyer to cover part 
of the purchase price, easing immediate financial burdens and making the deal more accessible  
to buyers with limited capital. And stock swaps enable buyers to use their own equity as currency, 
preserving cash and ideally aligning interests between the parties—a tool that can be particularly 
powerful under challenging market conditions.

For example, one large automotive-equipment manufacturer purchased a controlling stake in  
a company with a prominent set of products in energy management, such as sensors and 
actuators for electric motors. The acquisition was financed by bridge facilities that included both 
a substantial bridge loan and buyer cash, including the proceeds of prefinancing transactions. 
Taking an innovative approach allowed the two companies to create one of the largest worldwide 
automotive suppliers. In another transaction, a leading supplier in the automotive-aftermarket 
industry acquired an adjacent business for cash at closing, plus an earn out of up to an additional 
20 percent in the near-term quarters following closing. 

Consider alternative transaction structures 
Finally, players in the automotive ecosystem are considering alternative transaction structures 
beyond traditional 100 percent stock or asset sales; alternative transactions such as spin-offs 
and joint ventures can not only reduce the acquirer’s financial commitment and risks but also 
help build conviction going forward. 

Spin-offs can significantly advance automotive dealmaking by allowing companies to focus on 
their core competencies and streamline operations, which can lead to improved efficiency and 
profitability. By creating independent entities, companies can attract targeted investments and 
enhance strategic flexibility, fostering innovation and competitiveness in the market. Like other 
forms of separation activities (such as carve-outs and split-offs), they can also help both the 
parent company and the new entity build distinct cultures and adopt new structures, enhancing 
their ability to innovate. Additionally, spin-offs and other separations can diagnose and correct 
areas of inefficiency, highlight new ways of working, and improve overall market performance by 
freeing up significant capital and resources. For example, one global automaker spun off a niche 
product line, which proceeded to enter into individual partnerships with digital natives more 
suited to its business and customers.

100

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?In fact, multiple players across the automotive ecosystem are achieving strategic combinations 
through partnerships and joint ventures for collaborations that can bolster innovation, enable 
market expansion, and optimize resources. For example, some OEMs are partnering to build 
electric cars and developing internet-connected vehicles in Greater China, leveraging local 
distribution networks and regional expertise to broaden access to the other company’s product 
offerings. Two major companies in the broader automotive ecosystem, to take another example, 
have agreed to the joint development, production, and sale of a new fuel cell stack for automotive 
applications; one partner has the exclusive right to produce and sell the improved version, while 
the other commercializes it for other applications. And two European companies have partnered 
to focus on battery recycling, as both seek to enhance sustainability and resource efficiency  
in the automotive sector.

Deals don’t always have an obvious buyer, particularly when an industry’s technologies are 
beginning to sunset and sectors are experiencing tectonic change. But as the automotive 
industry demonstrates, proactive dealmakers can still find creative solutions for M&A challenges, 
getting deals done despite profound challenges and creating value for sellers and buyers—even 
when finding the right buyer requires a more imaginative approach.

in M&A

Generative AI is already making its way into the day-to-day world  
of M&A, and more use cases are emerging. How should companies 
approach the opportunity? 

by Ben Ellencweig, Mieke Van Oostende, and Rui Silva  
with Julia Berbel 

102

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Generative AI (gen AI) is making its mark across a gamut of industries and functions. Yet as 
companies seek to capture the immense economic potential from gen AI and traditional AI, 
they’re finding that it will take time to identify and prioritize the most impactful and economically 
sound use cases, understand what is and isn’t—yet—achievable, and train employees for  
a broad range of applications and initiatives.

M&A is no exception. There are significant opportunities for gen AI across the end-to-end M&A 
process, from defining an M&A strategy to conducting due diligence to executing integrations or 
separations. Delivering successful transactions and building an effective M&A program is a 
resource-intensive process with numerous pain points, and it’s clear that new technologies can 
help. In fact, gen AI solutions are already being successfully applied.

The goal of this article is not to reel off big numbers; suffice to say, the potential is enormous. As 
dealmakers prepare for what’s to come, we want to share our real-time perspective. We’ll explore 
some potential M&A use cases, provide examples of solutions that are already being deployed, 
and offer practical steps on how organizations can use gen AI to enhance their M&A capabilities.

How gen AI is gaining traction in M&A

For years, our research has shown that taking a programmatic approach to M&A in the long term 
can significantly boost an organization’s performance compared with its peers. Yet M&A 
execution is a very labor-intensive activity, requiring thoughtful allocation of resources and a 
balanced focus between integration activities and core business continuity. It is inherent to  
the nature of M&A that any deal, small or large, requires real work and real people capacity to 
successfully execute it. Gen AI, like many other technologies, exists to help leaders do more  
with less, make better decisions, and ultimately help their organizations create value in the long 
term. More specifically, four categories of use cases for gen AI can materially improve the  
M&A process: faster and better-quality sourcing of potential targets; expediting the diligence 
and negotiation process; executing the integration or separation with excellence; and 
strengthening in-house M&A capabilities.

Faster and better-quality sourcing of targets
There is a surfeit of potential companies to acquire, sell to, or partner with. A huge amount of  
data about these companies is obtainable. In fact, there’s so much information that organizations’ 
M&A teams can get bogged down sorting through and processing it all. The most successful 
M&A programs look beyond their core business into adjacencies and potential step-outs, and 
this is where gen AI can be most impactful. Companies are in a race because their competitors 
are searching for targets, too. They also have to be thorough: target assessment needs to 
encompass several dimensions to identify the highest-value potential targets with the right 
strategic and cultural fit. Deal scanning is a prominent, proven use case for traditional AI,  
but when coupled with gen AI it can go further to find and interpret broader sets of structured 
and unstructured data, synthesize results to answer quantitative and qualitative prompts, and 
highlight key elements of strategic, financial, and cultural fit of all potential targets. With gen AI, 
companies can identify and pursue targets they wouldn’t otherwise have on their radar (exhibit).

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?For example, a North America–based company in the consumer-packaged-goods industry 
used McKinsey’s proprietary tool DealScan.AI to search and evaluate potential investments. 
First, the tool identified approximately 1,600 viable targets according to initial prompts. Then it 
applied bespoke quantitative and qualitative prioritization criteria, including whether there  
was a direct-to-consumer operating model, information about subscription-based product 
assortments, and details about recent fundings. This led to the prioritization of 40 targets—most 
of which the company had not considered before—that matched all requirements.

Expediting the diligence and negotiation process
Gen AI can expedite the diligence and negotiation process. For example, it can summarize key 
diligence documents, surface risks, draft initial memoranda based on a deal’s specific parameters, 
source applicable statutes and regulations, identify helpful case law to ease friction in the 
negotiations phase, and generate other highly accurate outputs (such as first drafts of the deal 
announcement and regulatory filings). As one can imagine, these use cases can save a significant 
portion of the time currently required to perform the different legal tasks involved in deal 
negotiations, signing, and closing.

Executing the integration or separation with excellence
Seasoned dealmakers know that deal synergies need to be captured quickly—and that 
sometimes, by taking too long, companies can squander significant value. Organizations going 
through sizable M&A events are particularly likely to get diverted and see organic momentum 
decline, with an average decrease in excess revenue growth of seven percentage points 
compared with peers.1 Sluggish integrations can frustrate customers, demotivate employees, 
and sometimes cause organizations to stall.

Tools powered by gen AI can do a lot of the heavy lifting. In fact, a wide range of time- and 
resource-consuming tasks can be accelerated and, in some cases, almost fully automated. One 
striking use case is to have a gen AI “coach,” trained on M&A best practices and on the 
organization’s specific M&A playbook, that delivers fast and smart answers to questions from 
integration and separation leaders and team members. Applications are rapidly evolving, 
including McKinsey’s myIMO, which is powered by gen AI to help improve team capabilities and 
efficiency. For example, a team could ask the tool, “What are the right steps to integrate the 
acquired company’s brand with our own, and what is the best timing to do that?” Or a team  
could give it the following prompt: “Draft a memo about upcoming changes in employee benefits 
considering the following changes.” The application is trained on a vast repository of M&A 
playbooks and best practices to help companies make well-informed decisions about their 
integrations or separations. Other uses being developed include post-day-one value creation 
recommendations, such as identifying real-time synergy opportunities based on a company’s 
available data; automated summaries and comparisons of internal policies that need to be 
harmonized between the two organizations; the quick comparison and harmonization of job title 
and hierarchy structures, cost center, and general ledger definitions; and the automation  
of change management activities. The list goes on.

105

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Senior leaders need to frankly assess 
their current level of M&A capabilities 
and consider where in the M&A process 
technology can be used to materially 
improve the M&A engine.

Strengthening in-house M&A capabilities
Gen AI can strengthen a company’s internal capabilities by drawing on companies’ proprietary 
data from past deals to assess performance patterns and find insights about untapped 
opportunities. For example, it could assess a company’s portfolio of acquisitions and calculate 
the impact brought by each deal. It could also generate postmortem insight about how deals 
affect the business (for example, how and when the company’s organic revenue growth is 
typically affected after closing a deal). It could update the company’s proprietary playbook with 
recipes, nuances, and lessons learned (for example, “Deals of up to $1 billion typically require  
an integration team of five people, focused on the following tasks”). It could even generate 
personalized training programs in line with the specific function of an integration team member, 
as well as with the acquisition type and the deal timing (based on the following prompt, for 
example: “I am new to the team. I will be leading the HR integration for our acquisition of X 
company. What do I need to know? Where do I start?”).

How to get started

Gen AI will not fix a broken approach to M&A; it might even exacerbate it. The first step for  
senior leaders is to frankly assess their current level of M&A capabilities and to consider where  
in the M&A process technology can be used to materially improve the M&A engine.

The next steps are just as foundational:

 — Prioritize the gen AI use cases that create the most value. If your M&A strategy is focused  

on acquiring dozens of very small players, gen AI will have the greatest impact on opportunity 
scanning and assessment. Conversely, if you do one to two larger deals a year, gen AI may 
also help you streamline and accelerate the execution processes.

 — Drill down on whether to develop or to adopt. There is a full spectrum of choices for how  

a company can bring its prioritized use cases to life, and off-the-shelf solutions have recently 
been brought to market—with more expected over the next one to two years. As with any 
decision to either use in-house resources or outsource, leaders should consider their team’s 

106

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?existing expertise, the size of the required investment, the extent of the potential return 
(including how sustainable any competitive advantage would be), and the actions that the 
company’s peers are or could be taking.

 — Ensure that the right guardrails are in place. Gen AI is distinct from most existing 

technologies because it heightens certain risks—for example, security breaches, given its 
ease of access; reputational risks from quality control missteps; and potential intellectual 
property infringement. Legal and regulatory developments are fast moving, even as gen AI 
races forward. And the better the AI models are, the greater the potential risk that humans  
will simply disengage and not catch issues until it’s too late. It’s essential that organizations 
keep human beings at the forefront of the work, proactively identify and mitigate risks in 
partnership with their legal and technology teams, and maintain rigorous ethical standards.

Gen AI is a predictive language model, not a human being. As companies navigate the gen AI 
transition, they should consider how to use their newly freed-up time to focus on more strategic, 
high-value activities such as relationship building and eureka-moment problem solving, which 
technology cannot (yet) replace.

Commercial applications of gen AI in M&A are already gaining traction and will almost certainly 
accelerate in the next few years. The greatest question is not whether gen AI will affect 
dealmaking—it already is—but to what degree, how quickly, and to what consequence. We’ll  
be monitoring these developments in real time as they proceed.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?CEOs in M&A: Five 
actions only the chief 
executive can take

McKinsey research and interviews with global leaders reveal the activities 
and discussions that CEOs should be directly involved in to ensure success 
before, during, and after M&A transactions. 

by Anna Mattsson and Mieke Van Oostende

108

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The CEO’s agenda is chock full of urgent global business concerns—and is only getting more  
so. Apart from overseeing the day-to-day blocking and tackling of the business, the chief 
executive must mobilize everyone in the organization to react quickly to evolving technologies, 
changing capital and talent markets, emerging geopolitical concerns, and a raft of other 
challenges to the business. 

Through it all, the CEO must find ways to capture value-creating opportunities and grow the 
company. M&A (alongside portfolio momentum and market share performance) remains an 
important lever for doing just that—particularly as deal activity begins to recover from a decline in 
2023. “It’s always part of the toolbox,” says the CEO of one global consumer-packaged-goods 
company. “It’s a twofold strategy: You have to be good at what you do, but you also have to look 
around corners and think about the next three to five years.” 

But when exactly does it make the most sense for CEOs to engage in M&A? How can they help 
their organizations pursue strategic dealmaking while ensuring business continuity? To find out, 
we conducted a series of interviews with ten CEOs who’ve had substantial experience in M&A. 
We supplemented their insights with findings from decades of McKinsey research on the 
mindsets and best practices that distinguish the best CEOs from their peers, as well as previous 
McKinsey research on best practices in corporate transactions. 

The evidence points to five things that only the CEO can do before, during, and after an M&A 
transaction to increase the odds of deal success. Specifically, CEOs should train their focus on 
questions related to strategy; deal size; stakeholder management; the conviction, capacity,  
and capabilities associated with M&A; and culture. In this article, we’ll examine each of these five 
areas and help clarify which M&A tasks are “must dos” versus “must delegates” for global  
CEOs. The discussion may be particularly useful to newer CEOs, who are more likely than longer-
tenured CEOs to pursue M&A and other bold moves in their first 100 days or so—both to 
accelerate their strategies and to ensure that they have time to see targeted transformations 
through to completion.

The five aspects of M&A transactions that we’ve identified as must-dos for the CEO may seem 
intuitive, but surprisingly few CEOs take the time to consider M&A priorities against corporate 
strategy, for instance, or think about how to communicate differently with the board about a 
proposed deal. CEOs can have the greatest influence and impact in the following areas.

Define M&A priorities as you define the overall long-term  
corporate strategy

Experienced CEOs take the time to consider how M&A priorities fit within the long-term 
corporate strategy. When M&A priorities are clearly communicated, the business can quickly 
identify deal opportunities when they emerge and mount a strategic response. The CEO  
needs to work with business unit leaders, other C-suite leaders, and the board to establish their 
M&A strategy and priorities early on—for instance, devising an M&A blueprint that outlines  
deal themes and deal criteria, including what types of deals the business is seeking to target  
or determining whether a programmatic approach to dealmaking is warranted. 

109

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?An M&A blueprint involves conducting an internal assessment, a market assessment, and  
a review of boundary conditions, all of which can help executives determine why and where they 
will look for growth and transformation opportunities that, in many cases, cannot be achieved 
organically. The M&A blueprint prompts executives to come up with a plan for how they will seize 
and capture the most value from those opportunities (by delineating the high-level business  
case and preliminary integration plans). In this way, leaders can tell a compelling story (inside and 
outside the company) about the company’s dealmaking strategy and vision for the future.1

One CEO of a global food company told us his nature was to get involved very early on in setting 
M&A priorities in line with corporate strategy—but also noted that the main role of the CEO 
should be to focus on the strategic considerations of a deal and leave the valuation, detailed 
integration planning, and other details associated with executing the transaction to specialists. 
“It’s really about holding everyone accountable on the value point,” he said.

Spearhead large, transformational deals—delegate the rest 

Size and strategic scope matter when it comes to the CEO’s role in M&A. Early on, one travel 
company CEO reminded us, a lot of people are sharing information about a lot of deal opportunities 
with the CEO: “It’s better for the CEO to engage with a short list of opportunities—and even  
then, the CEO should not be the lead negotiator. The CEO should be a coach.” Additionally, it’s 
critical that this short list reflects the corporate and M&A strategy—not just the opportunities 
that happen to be available. 

For truly transformative large deals—think of a consumer company moving into the health and 
wellness space—the CEO should stay directly involved, serving as deal champion. This will mean 
leaning in at all phases—for instance, helping to convince the target company to enter the deal, 
defining the integration strategy and the pace and degree of change, and taking any other steps 
required to get the deal over the line. As the CEO of one large conglomerate explained, when 
large-scale transformation was the goal, he and the board would engage the whole way through, 
starting with the negotiation phases.

For truly transformative large deals, 
the CEO should stay directly involved, 
leaning in at all phases.

110

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?For smaller add-on or tuck-in deals, the business units, often led by a top-notch integration 
leader, are likely best positioned to drive the transaction. The CEO will still need to stay involved 
in these less-transformative deals but in a targeted way. Their primary role here will be to  
ensure strategic alignment and full value creation; this is where the core work of setting a precise 
M&A strategy and aligning it with long-term corporate strategy really pays off. In these smaller 
deals, the CEO should reiterate the M&A priorities, set permission structures, and create 
mechanisms for measuring progress against integration goals—but they should let deal teams 
and other leaders bring their own dealmaking skills to bear.

The CEO can obviously step in when substantial roadblocks emerge or when other issues arise. 
One pharmaceutical company CEO we spoke with noted his continued involvement in a bolt-on 
deal in which there was a lot of value at stake and intense scrutiny from investors and analysts. 
He helped shape the due diligence process, was directly involved in getting board approval, and 
stayed close to the integration planning discussions throughout to ensure swift decision-making 
and progress. 

Be the ‘chief stakeholder officer’

Perhaps the most important of all the tasks outlined here is that of convenor—or as one CEO 
termed it in our conversations, serving as the “chief stakeholder officer.” This is not a new role  
for CEOs; decades of McKinsey research on CEO excellence have found that the best chief 
executives pay close attention to stakeholder relationships, building a case for change and 
focusing on the “why.” This crucial task is magnified tenfold when considering the consensus 
building required to get large transactions over the finish line and bring two organizations 
together as one. The CEO must carefully and continually manage expectations about deals 
among leaders and employees in both the parent and target company. The chief executive  
should also encourage trust-based communications with the board, investors, suppliers, 
regulators, and other business partners. 

Managing expectations with the target CEO
It’s important for the CEO of the acquiring company to spend time with the CEO of the target 
company so they can understand each other’s position, key challenges, and corporate cultures. 
The CEO of one multinational organization pointed to the central role he played in the 
negotiations for several strategically important deals: in one case, scheduling private meetings  
with owners to align on details, and in another large deal—one involving a family-owned 
business—engaging with family members. Personal networks matter quite a lot in these 
situations. M&A transactions are about dollars and cents and synergies, but they are also about 
emotions, one CEO told us. “It might mean jumping on a plane to talk to the other CEO and  
get their conviction.” This cannot be delegated. For their part, the CEO of the target company can 
play a critical role as translator—for instance, giving the CEO of the acquiring company an 
overview of how the target company works, how it creates value, and who its key stakeholders 
are (see sidebar, “CEOs in M&A: What about the target company CEO?”).

Managing expectations with the board of directors 
Of course, the board of directors is among the most important stakeholders in the M&A process. 
Some board members may favor organic growth over M&A, so bringing them along is important  
for ensuring a smooth integration and full value capture, particularly at a time when boards are 
more risk averse than ever. 

111

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?CEOs in M&A: What about the target company CEO? 

We’ve discussed the role of the CEO in the 
parent company involved in an M&A deal—but 
what about the CEO of the target company? 
They face the same time, financial, and board 
pressures as the CEO of the acquiring company, 
so how can they structure their time and tasks to 
positively affect an acquisition?

A lot depends on the deal type (whether a private 
equity deal or a strategic transaction), but the 
reality is that the target CEO may be replaced 
because of the acquisition. Still, they play an 
important role not just in optimizing the price and 
handing over the keys once the deal closes but 

also in helping the CEO of the acquiring company 
understand how the organization works. 

The target company CEO can describe which 
strategies have worked (and not worked) in the 
target company, what the culture is like, and so  
on. With this information—and by leaving ego at 
the door—the target company CEO can help  
the combined company get off to the best 
possible start.

Whether they stay or go, they will have done their 
duty for shareholders.

The CEO’s work in this regard should start early—as soon as the initial discussions about M&A 
strategy, the M&A blueprint, and M&A priorities. The CEOs we spoke with pointed to the need for 
clear and frequent communications with the board. They have regular dialogues with the board 
and provide early indications of potential deals. Some CEOs offer quarterly updates on potential 
targets; companies that treat M&A as a capability tend to keep a running short list that they  
track and refresh regularly. Others conduct weekly check-ins with the board about aspects of 
transformative deals that are already underway. These CEOs don’t just show up in front  
of the board looking for deal approval; they continually pressure-test the business case for 
transactions with the board—in some cases even relying on board directors to help make 
introductions and connections. 

One CEO we spoke with noted that to foster trust and transparency around the company’s 
dealmaking strategy, he would take 15 to 20 minutes at every board meeting to update directors 
on the status of the team’s efforts to cultivate potential targets. Another CEO said he scheduled 
regular one-on-one discussions about the deal pipeline with the board chair. In fact, the CEO’s 
trust in the board and vice versa was mentioned repeatedly as a key factor in deal success—
especially in large deals affecting multiple business lines. 

Managing the expectations of other stakeholders 
CEOs should also keep other key stakeholders, including critical customers, regulators, 
authorities, media, and shareholders, on speed dial. In the case of customers, for instance, it’s 
incumbent upon the CEO to help explain how a deal will result in, say, more product or service 
options or other value-adding advantages for them. In the case of regulators, for instance, it may 
be helpful for the CEO to stay engaged in discussions about antitrust approvals, particularly  
in the case of larger deals that, because of regulatory requirements, tend to have a higher risk  
of being rejected.2

112

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Secure the three C’s: Conviction, capacity, and capabilities to  
execute on M&A 

A deal won’t achieve its full potential—or may not even see the light of day—if critical stakeholders 
inside the organization and the board of directors are not convinced the deal is worth pursuing. The 
responsibility for securing this organizational conviction from employees, managers, and board 
directors falls squarely on the CEO. “I wanted all the facts,” the CEO of a multinational organization 
told us when asked about his conviction about M&A. “I wanted to develop the rationale, but more 
important, I wanted everyone in the organization to understand the rationale.” He also understood 
that he could not tell a compelling M&A story to prospective targets, investors, the market, and 
others without that data.

A technology company CEO offered a cautionary tale about what can happen when conviction  
is lacking: He initiated an acquisition but left the company shortly after the deal was announced. 
The CEO had thought the board was committed—and initially, it was—but after he left, the 
board’s priorities changed, the deal was criticized by some shareholders, high-end talent jumped 
ship, and one board member went public with his negative opinion of the deal. The new CEO 
could not turn it around without this commitment from the board, and the deal faltered.

The CEO should also focus on two other C’s: building a management team with the capacity and 
capabilities to support the execution of the deal. A company’s ability to execute its strategy often 
comes down to whether it has enough financial, talent, and organizational capacity, plus clear 
processes and playbooks for all phases of M&A. One large financial organization was able to act 
quickly on deals, even during the shaky times of the 2008 credit crisis, because the CEO had 
built up conviction among key stakeholders to pursue deals that matched the company’s priorities. 
The CEO and senior-leadership team had also established a strong capability-building program 
to ensure they had the right negotiation, due diligence, and integration talent in place when 
opportunities emerged. In our experience, establishing an integration office, led by a chief 
integration officer, can be a critical success factor—regardless of the size or scope of the deal. 

As many of the leaders we spoke with noted, if the CEO is not committed and cannot support  
the conditions required to increase capacity and capabilities, it’s probably better not to pursue 
the deal at all. 

Be a culture champion 

Culture goes beyond ideas about how to act or what to wear; McKinsey’s research on organizational 
health points to several critical cultural attributes in high-performing organizations—including 
talent attraction and retention, role clarity, performance management, customer focus, and 
decision-making.3 Separate McKinsey research highlights the financial advantages of building 
and maintaining healthy organizational cultures—namely, a 5 percent increase in excess total 
shareholder returns (TSR) two years after deal closing in companies with healthy cultures, 
compared with a 17 percent decrease in excess TSR in companies with unhealthy cultures.4

113

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?In any size deal, the CEO must play a significant role in working with HR, business unit leaders, 
and others to assess the culture of both the parent company and target and to determine  
which aspects would work best in the combined organization. As one technology CEO told us,  
to set the right cultural foundation for the combined company, the organization needs “a really  
good understanding of its own DNA as well as that of the acquired asset”—a learning process 
that should start during due diligence. 

The CEO can work with other business leaders to take inventory of the skills and capabilities 
required, identifying gaps and reassigning people to the most valuable roles. A multinational 
company CEO noted that he spent significant time with the CEO of the target organization to 
assess cultural compatibility, build relationships, and find alignment. He used surveys and 
gathered feedback from employees to help inform the culture and ensure buy-in. His advice? 
Build a new culture for the combined company based on the existing context and reshape where 
needed. Another CEO added, “Don’t be afraid to back away if you sense a cultural divide.”

Although senior HR leaders will need to assist in this fact-finding process, the dedicated time 
spent by CEOs—at both the parent and target organizations—reconciling the organizational 
missions and values and communicating the vision for the combined company’s culture (through 
town halls and other forums) can pay off over time. As one CEO concluded, “You can’t overinvest 
in culture.”

With a focus on these five M&A actions, CEOs can directly influence the direction and success  
of deals—and preserve their own time and energy as well. They can set the strategy and nurture 
the stakeholders but delegate the rest to a crack team that can execute the diligence, find the 
targets, manage the negotiations, and run the day-to-day integration. According to the CEOs we 
spoke with, the most important task is to establish the guardrails—for the team and for yourself. 
“Find a mirror, look into it, and ask yourself if you really feel this deal is the best for the company 
and for yourself. If there is a little bit of doubt, you need to buy more time.”

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Why managing culture is 
critical for value creation 
in M&A

Executives can take three important actions to integrate parent and target 
company cultures more smoothly and generate the intended value from a 
deal more quickly. 

by Emily O’Loughlin, Kameron Kordestani, and Rebecca Kaetzler  
with Evelyn De Blieck 

115

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?An organization’s culture—or the common set of behaviors, mindsets, and beliefs that shape 
how people work and interact—is a driving force for its success. In companies with strong 
cultures, employees at all levels understand the business’s mission and purpose, how decisions 
are made, how performance is measured, and individuals’ roles in achieving critical 
organizational objectives. 

It’s always surprising, then, when culture is overlooked in discussions about M&A. Typically, the 
focus is, primarily and understandably, on the mechanics of the transaction rather than the 
potential for cultural transformation. Considering both in parallel is critical, however—and, as our 
research demonstrates, actively managing cultural factors is important for protecting the value 
of a deal. 

Indeed, according to a 2023 McKinsey Global Survey on M&A capabilities, lack of cultural fit and 
friction between the acquiring company and the target is the most common reason why 
integrations don’t meet expectations for value creation.1 Roles may be conflated, processes may 
become confusing, top talent may exit as a result, performance may suffer, and the intended 
value from M&A may be at risk (value may even be destroyed). 

When merging organizations get the culture piece right, however, they are more than 40 percent 
more likely than their peers to meet or surpass cost synergy targets, and up to 70 percent more 
likely to meet or surpass revenue targets.2 Separate McKinsey research points to organizational 
health as a critical factor in the success of large acquisitions.3 In particular, three behaviors that 
are typically found in healthy organizations are also strongly correlated with the creation of deal 
value: talent management, external (customer) focus, and internal discipline. All three can serve  
as deal accelerators rather than integration obstacles.

Based on our decades of work helping companies in a range of industries and geographies 
manage their dealmaking, we’ve identified three important actions executives can take to  
ensure that they don’t treat culture as a “second day” factor—that is, they should take the time  
to systematically diagnose potential cultural issues, set cultural priorities, and establish and 
communicate a clear cultural transformation plan.4 

We’ve outlined these findings in previous articles, but as markets begin to see an increase in M&A, 
it may be helpful for executives to revisit these principles. Here, we do just that and suggest a few 
ways that business leaders can actively integrate culture into their M&A conversations.

First, let’s set our terms: Different leaders may have different definitions of what culture is. We 
define it as the outcome of the vision or mission that propels a company, the values that guide the 
behavior of its people, and the management practices, working norms, and mindsets that 
characterize how work gets done. A company’s vision and values are almost always clearly 
defined well before a merger or acquisition. Less clear, however, are the ways in which work gets 
done every day and what spurs those behaviors. Misunderstandings and friction among teams 
can occur as a result and end up jeopardizing deal success.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Leaders can take three steps to 
actively consider aspects of culture in 
their M&A discussions: diagnosing 
how work gets done, setting cultural 
priorities, and hard-wiring and 
supporting cultural change.

McKinsey research points to three important steps leaders can take to help ensure that they are 
actively considering aspects of culture in their M&A discussions: diagnosing how work gets done, 
setting cultural priorities, and hard-wiring and supporting cultural change.

It’s important for leaders to take these actions early in the process—well before close, if 
possible—and the discussions must involve key stakeholders from across the parent and target 
companies (employees, human resources, the top team, the board of directors, and so on). 
Culture is everyone’s business, and getting full commitment from across the organizations 
involved in the deal is the only way to achieve sustained value creation and transformation 
through M&A. 

Diagnose how the work gets done 

Right at the outset of the merger process—as early as the due diligence phase—it’s critical for 
leaders to understand how work gets done in both the acquiring and target companies. How  
do people make decisions, for instance? How does the organization motivate people, and what 
systems do they have in place to hold people accountable? 

To answer these questions, leaders shouldn’t rely on gut instinct. Instead, they can deploy  
a range of diagnostics aimed at collecting perspectives from employees in both organizations—
including employee surveys, management interviews, and employee focus groups. Each of these 
diagnostics has its advantages and disadvantages, so the best approach is for leaders to use  
a combination of all three, keeping in mind that the terminology used across these tools must be 
consistent. In this way, leaders can gain a clear picture of cultural similarities, potential points  
of friction, and opportunities to build common norms and a common language about the way that 
people work.

Other sources of critical information that leaders can gather even before a deal is signed include 
interactions between deal teams and with the target company’s leaders, as well as conversations 
with customers and suppliers of the target company. Recently, leaders have been using 
generative AI and other technologies to collect public data about workforce sizes, employee 
satisfaction scores, and so on and to build up their understanding of the cultural aspects  
of each of the organizations involved in a deal. 

117

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Again, the most important point in all this fact finding, according to executives we’ve spoken with, 
is to establish an objective set of cultural criteria at the very start of the planning process: Doing 
so “would have eliminated some of the misperceptions about both company cultures,” one airline 
executive explained, “and we could have had conversations based on facts rather than just 
anecdotes or beliefs.”5

Set cultural priorities 

With data about existing company cultures in hand, leaders can take the next step and set 
cultural priorities related to the transaction. Specifically, they will need to develop a point of view 
on how various aspects of culture can help them maximize value and, relatedly, a perspective on 
how to manage differences in ways of working. McKinsey research suggests common points of 
friction can include decision-making and communication styles, approaches to innovation  
and collaboration, management of customer relationships, and differences in operational and 
financial management. 

Some key questions for leadership in both the acquiring company and the target company are: 
Which of these cultural elements are part of our special sauce? What behaviors or management 
practices are needed for the new company to succeed? And what “from–to” shifts are required? 
Based on the answers to those questions, leaders may need to redefine roles and performance 
targets. They may want to reinforce behavioral changes by introducing new cultural artifacts— 
for instance, new brand colors, a reframed business mission, or a new statement of values for the 
merged entity. The top team will need to serve as a role model for behavioral changes. And, to 
sustain employee engagement in any change efforts, senior leaders will need to tell a compelling 
and consistent change story, personalizing it with their own experiences.

More tactically, once leaders have identified desired behaviors, they can develop change plans 
that are structured around cultural themes, translated into concrete initiatives, and supported by 
key performance indicators (KPIs). If a company wants to build an agile and collaborative sales 
force, for instance, leaders might set several cultural themes: cross-selling, working together, 
making decisions quickly, and managing performance. For each of these themes, leaders could 
launch initiatives devoted to, say, clarifying decision rights, training salespeople about the 
escalation process for bids, and refining certain governance and operating processes. Similarly, 
leaders could establish metrics by which to mark and monitor performance: time to respond to 
bids, customer satisfaction scores, employee satisfaction scores, and so on. 

The top team will need to serve as a role 
model for behavioral changes.

unseen forces,” McKinsey, March 26, 2019.

118

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Taken together, these themes and their constituent initiatives and KPIs can encourage the 
desired behaviors and promote the overall goals of the merger. 

Hard-wire and support cultural change 

Once leaders have identified key cultural themes and initiatives, they can take steps to hard-wire 
these elements of culture into the new company’s operating model and daily practices. If leaders 
aim to “create a culture of respect,” for instance, that point must be reflected in company policies 
and value statements. “Evidence of respectful behavior” may be part of the criteria for individual 
performance reviews and compensation calculations. And at the end of every governance meeting, 
participants might openly reflect on how respected they felt by others during the conversation. 
Cascading and reinforcing the desired cultural changes in this way can help companies quickly 
establish the new normal. 

Signature initiatives involving the top team—for instance, changing the company dress code to 
match that of the acquired company—can help underline its commitment and create a sense of 
shared endeavor. 

Of course, formal communication structures are not always the best way to influence  
an organization. As part of the change effort, the top team should identify and empower change 
agents and influencers across the acquiring and target companies, giving them the training  
and skills they need to be effective in the role. 

Senior leaders should also track the implementation of themes and initiatives with the same rigor 
they use for financial targets. That means developing clear milestones, monitoring them centrally, 
tracking them closely, and taking corrective action quickly when needed. 

As our research and experience suggest, culture is a critical (if underestimated) factor in the 
success of any merger or acquisition. It must be a central topic on any agenda in which deals are 
being discussed, whether leaders are talking about proposed transactions or active integrations 
and transformation through M&A. Otherwise, as the numbers demonstrate, organizations risk 
leaving significant opportunities for value creation and growth on the table.

A strategy for managing 
talent during M&A 
transactions

Keeping top talent in the fold and engaged before, during, and after a large 
deal closes is critical for creating value from transactions. Here’s how to 
address their needs throughout the M&A phases.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?There is a paradox built into some M&A transactions that, when left unaddressed, can delay 
value creation or even demolish an otherwise solid deal thesis: Sometimes the very talent that an 
acquirer needs—the people and skill sets that perhaps attracted the acquirer to the target 
company in the first place—may not want to stay, given the timing or nature of the deal. 

Departures of top talent can raise operational risks, weaken morale, or create other negative 
effects on an M&A integration. In the case of one serial acquirer, for instance, the near loss of an 
individual contributor turned out to be significant: This person was the only one at the target 
company who knew how to run an important process. The acquiring company managed to retain 
this individual at the eleventh hour, but the situation highlighted for the acquiring company a 
major gap in how their leaders identified critical talent.

In today’s tight labor market, we’ve observed headhunters reaching out to some of the most 
talented people—mostly client-facing and revenue-generating staff and experts with specialized 
skill sets—at both target and acquiring companies on the very day a deal is announced. These 
high-performing employees are typically presented with more exit opportunities and are thus 
more likely than lower-performing employees to bolt when a deal is announced—and, in our 
experience, are still likely to do so in the two to three years after the deal closes. Meanwhile, 
research has shown that replacing an employee can cost up to three or four times the annual 
salary for the role1; in a high-stakes M&A integration, the costs of productivity loss and delayed 
value creation could be far higher. 

Not every deal is centered on acquiring talent, of course, and some departures are inevitable in 
nearly every integration. But given the costs and opportunities at stake, senior leadership teams 
should think early and often about the actions they can take to keep people in the fold before, 
during, and after integrations. 

Our decades of research and experience working with global organizations on M&A integrations 
reveal three steps leaders can take to retain top talent during all phases of dealmaking:

 — Prepare the ground for integration ahead of the deal announcement by actively identifying 
high-potential performers, or “high potentials,” across roles and revisiting incentives.

 — Keep employees focused during integration and ahead of the deal close by communicating 
effectively, empowering frontline managers, and identifying key performance metrics.

 — Sustain postclose changes by establishing onboarding and development programs and 

revisiting the employee value proposition (EVP). 

Most important, these steps should be discussed and built into integration plans long before a 
deal is announced. In this way, acquiring companies can identify top talent, match them to 
mission-critical, value-creating roles, help them adapt to new workplace realities, and limit any 
disruption to day-to-day operations.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Before a deal is announced: Prepare the ground

In any organization, there are typically four crucial employee groups: the 2 percent who are high 
potentials and future leaders, the value creators and those who own important business initiatives 
and deliver on the deal synergies, the influencers and other people with deep social capital who 
can make change happen, and a broader group of mission-critical people who keep the company 
humming—for instance, a top salesperson or technology manager (exhibit). 

Typically, when it comes to the talent component of a deal, an acquirer’s first action is to identify 
which employees fit into each of these four groups within the target company—a reasonable 
reaction. To get a more complete picture, however, they should also extend this exercise to 
categorize the people in their own organization. And when looking at talent in both the parent and 
target companies, they should consider employees at all levels, not just in the first few 
management layers. After all, we all know people who play vital organizational roles without lofty 
titles or dozens of direct reports.

As part of this assessment, acquirers should also review existing incentives and consider 
whether they would still be fit for purpose after integration. McKinsey research reveals that in  
the post-COVID-19 talent market, nonfinancial incentives, such as public praise from  
managers, leadership attention, and leadership development opportunities, are just as critical  
as financial ones. 

With these data about talent and incentives in hand, the top team can solidify its retention plans 
and, most important, actively shape the messaging on this topic. In our experience, when senior 
leaders convey their plans for change with empathy, consistency, and a sense that employees’ 
skills, insights, and contributions matter, top talent will be more likely to stay in the wake of M&A.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?One financial-services provider, for example, embarked on a major acquisition that it hoped 
would help the organization maintain its core business while still seizing the potential for growth 
in new product and service areas. Senior leaders knew they would need a comprehensive 
understanding of the talent needed not only to deliver services to customers day to day but also 
to support the future state that served as the rationale for the deal. Rather than rely only on 
performance ratings to identify this critical talent, senior leaders in the financial institution 
tapped into the insights of its people managers (across both the acquiring and target companies) 
to identify the high potentials, employees in business-critical roles, and so on. 

After identifying the specific people deemed essential, leaders in both the acquiring and target 
companies worked together to build and deploy a retention communications strategy tailored to 
a dozen talent archetypes, which helped them retain nearly all the most critical employees. 

Between the deal announcement and close: Maintain stability and focus 

The period between the deal announcement and close can be filled with uncertainty, creating 
anxiety and disengagement across both organizations and often spurring high performers to 
consider their options—especially with headhunters on the prowl.2 It’s important, therefore, for 
senior leaders to act quickly to reassure and engage top talent. 

Communication skills have become more important than ever in an era in which people spend 
less time in an office and engagement may be low. But leaders should understand that a stirring 
memo or town hall meeting about an impending deal won’t be enough; employees generally  
pay less attention to what leaders say and more attention to what they do, including which 
employees they recognize and reward, which meetings they attend, and how receptive they are 
to innovative ideas. 

Maintaining employees’ engagement during a transaction requires a steady hum of two-way 
communication and support for change. Acquiring companies should establish a dedicated team 
to manage talent-related issues, address concerns promptly, identify and squelch myths and 
untruths, and focus on business objectives. This team should invite top talent into integration 
activities when possible, including in conversations with executives and the board, to ensure that 
their perspectives are reflected throughout the integration. 

Acquirers should also remember the role their frontline managers can play in retaining talent 
through integration periods and equip them with the right information, tools, and training. 
Research shows that, across industries and functions, most employees trust their direct 
supervisors more than anyone else in the organization. In the case of M&A integrations, frontline 
managers can use their regular one-on-one meetings with top performers to discuss their 
concerns about integration and aspirations for the new organization and to generally make them 
feel heard and valued. Frontline managers can send these insights up the chain of command to 
help senior leaders track attitude changes by department, function, business, and region.

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?Metrics are always central to effective 
performance management, but 
monitoring and measuring the outcome 
of retention programs are especially 
important in times of transition. 

Metrics are always central to effective performance management, but monitoring and measuring 
the outcome of retention programs are especially important in times of transition. With that in 
mind, senior integration leaders should identify the most critical metrics to monitor across each 
of the four categories of talent. They should regularly discuss progress and shortfalls to make 
timely course corrections and intervene as needed. A thoughtful approach to exit interviews can 
also help the organization react quickly to any trends described by departing employees. 

In the case of a transaction involving a large North American bank, the executive team built and 
deployed a robust “manager’s tool kit” to maintain consistent communications about integration 
and to set frontline leaders up for success in high-stakes interactions. The tool kit included 
speaking notes and detailed answers to frequently asked questions. 

The bank’s communications team also built and deployed a quantitative dashboard to track 
which messages about integration and change resonated in each part of the organization, as well 
as in the target company, and where they needed to launch interventions or nudge managers to 
improve communications. The effort led to significantly lower attrition than expected across top 
performers and value-creating roles—both keen areas of focus in this integration. 

After the deal closes: Solidify engagement and retention

Acquirers can identify key talent at the outset of deal discussions and take steps to keep top 
performers on board during the integration—but the work doesn’t stop there. Leaders must 
combat the change fatigue that often sets in during integrations and find ways to engage their 
high performers, even after the deal closes. 

Indeed, the most effective engagement and retention programs typically begin immediately at 
close and are keenly focused on creating a sense of unity and purpose among employees from 
both organizations as they begin to execute the new company’s strategies. A comprehensive 
onboarding program for the merged entity is critical. Each step in the onboarding process, from 
getting access to new tools and technologies to being physically set up in a new location, can 
make or break the integrated organization’s relationship with its top performers. It may be 
helpful, then, to include these high potentials in meetings with senior leadership and involve them 
directly in discussions about the integration and the new company’s strategic direction, which 
can reinforce their importance to the company.

124

M&A Annual Report: Is the wave finally arriving?The postclose period can also be a good moment to roll out a redesigned, best-in-class EVP to 
align with the direction of the new company that includes, for instance, new development and 
skill-building opportunities, geographic and functional rotations, and better work–life balance. 
By the new, merged entity showing rather than simply telling employees how much it values  
their contributions, it can bring its values to life, strengthen culture and engagement, and 
improve the long-term retention of high performers.

A B2B electronic-materials player, for example, embarked on a large-scale organizational 
transformation in the wake of a significant acquisition. That effort required the organization to 
seek different kinds of talent beyond the types of candidates it had traditionally attracted. 
Clearly, this would require a new approach to talent attraction and retention and a revised EVP. 

Recognizing this, talent and business unit leaders crafted a new EVP and launched communications 
and change management programs to help other leaders across the organization understand it. 
They asked managers and employees to help integrate the five core elements of this EVP—impact 
on society, impact on customers, impact on the company, impact on the team, and impact on 
personal success—into their conversations, processes, and day-to-day work. 

They then identified and enlisted “cultivation leaders,” who were paired with job candidates to 
convey the company’s unique value proposition and to create a personal connection to 
demonstrate that this organization was different. Some top performers did depart, but senior 
leaders believed the efforts persuaded many highly valued people to stay. 

While not every transaction requires a focus on talent, talent is a critical element in most deal 
theses. By identifying essential talent early, at all levels, and crafting a fit-for-purpose  
retention strategy, organizations will keep more of the people they need to deliver value and  
set up the new company for sustained success.
