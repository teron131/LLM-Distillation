McKinsey Global Institute

The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact 
base to aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the 
world’s companies and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s 
regional, sectoral, and functional knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial 
direction and decisions are solely the responsibility of MGI directors and partners.

Our research is currently grouped into five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity—creating and harnessing the world’s assets productively

 — Resources of the world—building, powering, and feeding the world

 — Human potential—achieving the potential of human talent

 — Global connections—shaping of economies by flows of goods, people, capital, and ideas

 — Technologies and markets of the future—the next big arenas of value and competition

We aim for independent and fact-based research. None of our work is commissioned 
or funded by any business, government, or other institution; we share our results 
publicly free of charge; and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While 
we engage multiple distinguished external advisers to contribute to our work, the 
analyses presented in our publications are MGI’s alone, and any errors are our own.

On the cusp of 
a new era?

Summary

The past two and a half years have been extraordinary. What we are seeing is surely 
more than the progression of just another business cycle. The unnerving combination 
of a global pandemic compounded by energy scarcity, rapid inflation, and geopolitical 
tensions boiling over has people wondering what certainties are left. Today’s events 
might even feel like a cluster of earthquakes that is reshaping our world.

We have been here before. Similar “earthquakes” have struck the past: in the immediate 
aftermath of World War II (1944–46), during the period around the oil crisis (1971–73), and at 
the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union (1989–92). Like a real earthquake, each of them 
changed the global landscape with the sudden release of powerful underlying forces that had 
been building up around a fault line over time—but in these cases, unfolding over a few years 
rather than in a big bang. Each of them ushered in a new era: the Postwar Boom (1944–71), the 
Era of Contention (1971–89), and the Era of Markets (1989–2019). Are we now on the cusp of a 
new era presaged by today’s earthquakes?

We are reminded most of the aftermath of the oil shocks in the early 1970s, which shared 
features resonant with today: an energy crisis, a negative supply shock, the return of inflation, 
a new monetary era, rising multipolar geopolitical assertion, resource competition, and 
slowing productivity in the West. The aftershocks came in many waves and took almost 
20 years to resolve. The return of stability required investment in energy independence by 
non-OPEC countries and painful monetary stabilization, including double-digit interest rates 
and recessions associated with the US Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker. In addition, 
there was strong political will, personified by Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and 
Deng Xiaoping.

But there are differences between now and the earthquake of the early 1970s that arguably 
magnify the reasons for concern. Today’s world is much more globally entwined, financially 
leveraged, and carbon constrained. This time, can we do better and write a new narrative of 
progress more quickly?

Of course, we could be overblowing the momentousness of current events. However, this is 
different from other tremors like the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the dot-com bust in 2000, 
and the global financial crisis in 2008. Most of these events were on the demand side and 
were largely contained in a region or a sector. Today, however, we face a supply-side crisis, 
inherently physical rather than psychological, against a backdrop of a shifting geopolitical 
landscape upon which the crisis needs to be resolved.

Moreover, today’s earthquakes have largely come as surprises, shaking the world after a 
30-year era of relative calm. In truth, for all of us authors, and we suspect most of our readers, 
our professional lives have played out on one clear and consistent global landscape—one 
where perhaps we have embedded many implicit assumptions and beliefs about how the 
world works, which are now under direct challenge.

We start the next era—if indeed one is about to unfold—from a fundamentally different point 
from which we started the prior one. The world at the turn of the 1990s had a much more 
obvious gap between the developed and the developing worlds: huge populations poor in 
energy and resources, more people living in rural areas outside of the orbit of global markets

information. In the previous era, the world converged much more into a globalized economy, 
with rapid catch-up growth for billions of people where we managed peacefully to keep the 
gains. Without question today’s world is better, but with this growth there is also much more 
disruption to established constituencies, more pangs of imbalance, and more powerful new 
players asserting their place at the global table.

What could that new era look like? The die is not yet cast. While there is a current direction of 
travel, there are also complex unresolved questions, which will determine how the situation 
plays out. To try to build a map for the new era, we looked at five domains (Exhibit 1).

In the world order, there is a tendency toward multipolarity, which in turn may imply 
realignment into regionally and ideologically aligned groups. This immediately raises 
questions of what might that multipolarity look like in practice; will the economy remain global 
in nature, and will we find new workable mechanisms to cooperate beyond the economy? 
Moreover, years of relative moderation in international politics seem to be giving way to more 
political polarization between blocs. How effectively will global and local institutions and 
leadership adapt to, and shape, this different world order?

Across technology platforms, the key drivers of the most recent era’s digitization and 
connectivity seem to be approaching saturation. Yet a set of already potent transversal 
technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and bioengineering, may combine to create 
another big surge of progress in the next era. At the same time, combined with the forces 
described, technology may move to the forefront of geopolitical competition and call into 
question the very meaning of being human. Again, big questions remain. What impact will the 
next wave of technologies have on work and social order? How will technology, institutions, 
and geopolitics interact?

In demographic forces, a young world will evolve into an aging, urban world, the age of 
communicable diseases may give way to an age of noncommunicable diseases, and inequality 
within countries may increasingly challenge the social fabric. How will countries, institutions,

institutions respond to inequality?

Today, we have been forced to refocus on resource and energy systems where recent 
underinvestment combined with geopolitical disruption has created real vulnerability. There is 
a strong desire to shift investment toward low-carbon energy, but total investment in all forms 
of energy appears to be struggling to keep pace with energy needs. Resilience, feasibility, 
and affordability concerns may challenge the velocity of the transition. Critical resources for 
the future economy are becoming economic and geopolitical pinch points. Question marks 
abound. How will the world navigate an affordable, resilient, and feasible path to climate 
stability? What dynamics will play out between those who have critical resources and those 
who do not?

Finally, let’s look at capitalization, the long-term trend toward capital-deep and financialized 
economies. Economic growth rates appear to be normalizing. Growing leverage and credit 
may evolve into balance sheet stress. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) century will, on its current course and speed, give way to the Asian 
century. Will we find the next productivity engine to drive growth? Will the rise and rise of the 
global balance sheet be reversed?

If we are indeed in the early throes of a seismic shift—as the evidence appears to suggest—
leaders must both prepare for the possibility of a new era and position themselves to shape 
it. The current vantage point may invite pessimism. Yet, through all the ups and downs of the 
world, progress has marched on and performed the miraculous. Our times demand action, but 
history also offers great hope.

In this paper, we suggest a framework to imagine the new era, drawn from a historical 
perspective of the structural tectonics that underpinned the world we have today and how 
they might play out in the next era. Working out how to respond to the current moment and the 
path ahead is complex and requires boldness. We invite you to join us in a conversation about 
the future.

1. Eras and  

earthquakes

Recent events would have been jolting under any circumstances.1 They are all the more 
unsettling because we have not experienced anything like this for many years. For all of us 
authors—and we suspect most of our readers—our professional lives have played out on one 
clear and consistent global landscape. To fully understand current events, we therefore need 
to zoom out to a perspective broader than any of our individual memories.

The present time reminds us of three previous periods of global inflection and reordering—
more so in the intensity, global reach, and concurrence of major events than in their 
specific content. We describe these periods as “earthquakes.” Each is the culmination of 
subterranean tensions building over time, amassing at a point of fracture, and then apparently 
releasing suddenly and with great force. Fortunately, perhaps, the earthquakes in economic 
and political affairs that we describe happen not in a split second but through a series of 
consecutive tremors in the transition from one era to the next.

Each of the three earthquakes preceded a new “era”—a prolonged period during which the 
underlying global landscape or terrain remained relatively consistent. That is not to say the 
world itself was constant in each era. The eras that played out in the postwar period have 
combined to be one of the most transformative times in human history, but the underlying 
terrain upon which often radical change played out was relatively settled.

Significant regional and sectoral tremors have occurred from time to time (most notably the 
1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis), but overall the consistency of 
the terrain was so marked that many stopped questioning whether the ground could ever shift 
again—until now, when we are forced anew to check our implicit assumptions about the world.

To try to map the eras that followed each pivotal transition, we looked at five domains: 
(1) world order: the institutions, frameworks, and rules that shape international affairs; 
(2) technology platforms: platforms and applied sciences enabling development and 
innovation; (3) demographic forces: demographic trends and socioeconomic contours 
across populations; (4) resource and energy systems: the systems for transporting and 
converting energy and materials for use; and (5) capitalization: drivers of global supply 
and demand, and trajectories of finance and wealth. We look at the economic outcomes 
collectively delivered by each domain, specifically changes in global growth and productivity. 
Through this lens, each era can be seen to have its own distinctive landscape upon which 
varied but similarly remarkable progress took place (Exhibit 2).

McKinsey Global InstituteThe Postwar Boom (1944–71)

The years surrounding the end of World War II (1944–46) ushered in a new world order 
after the horrors of global conflict. The United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions 
(the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) were established, and the US 
dollar became the de facto global reserve currency pegged to gold. The United States 
officially ended its isolationist policies and formally assumed its hegemonic mantle at the 
Potsdam Conference; a few days later, the atomic bomb was detonated over Hiroshima. The 
organization of economies and societies shifted from wartime to peacetime reconstruction: 
for example, the Marshall Plan mobilized funds to rebuild Europe. Meanwhile, Joseph Stalin 
negotiated the division of Eastern Europe from Western Europe and raced to develop nuclear 
capabilities. The foundations for the first era were set.

In the world order, the globe transitioned to two competing blocs. In the Western bloc, which 
included the United States and Europe, pan-Western institutions such as the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Economic Community were created. The 
bipolar order led to a period of heightened geopolitical tensions with flashpoints including 
the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Korean and Vietnam wars. Meanwhile, the world decolonized 
as a weakened United Kingdom lost its grip, acutely demonstrated by the declaration of 
Indian independence in 1947 and the inability of the United Kingdom (along with France) to 
assert ownership of the Suez Canal in the 1950s. Hard colonialism was replaced with the new 
arrangements of NATO—in the 1950s and 1960s, more than 300,000 US troops on average 
were deployed in Europe—as well as the soft power of Westernization.2 Nuclear deterrence 
forestalled a return to open global aggression, but at the cost of a massive escalation. By 1971, 
there were around 40,000 nuclear warheads globally, 99 percent of them in the combined 
arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union.3

In technology platforms, innovations that had been developed before and during the war 
became the foundation for a golden age of engineering. The electrification of manufacturing 
enabled the mass production of affordable consumer durables. Fast, easy transportation 
became the Western norm: in the United States, there were two cars for every ten people in 
1946; by 1971, that had tripled to six for every ten.4 During these years, the jet engine, modern 
steelmaking with basic oxygen furnaces, semiconductors and integrated circuits, lasers, the 
shipping container, and the television emerged. The pinnacle was the Apollo program (spurred 
on by the Soviet Union’s early lead in the space race).

In demographic forces, modern (sub)urban life enabled by cars extended across the 
developed world, and with it the spread of US culture and its icons as well as the emergence 
of a confident youth culture. There was a step change in population growth, with most 
countries experiencing a baby boom. In the United States, the fertility rate peaked at 3.6 
births per woman in the late 1950s. The planet’s median age fell to 21 in 1970, never to be 
younger again.5 Globally, between 1950 and 1971, child mortality rates fell by 44 percent and 
life expectancy increased by nine years. But there was still considerable scope for progress in 
a predominantly poor, rural world. In 1971, about 60 percent of the world still lived in extreme 
poverty.6 And the majority were rural—only 37 percent lived in cities.

In resource and energy systems, the foundations of a global carbon-based energy system 
were established. Between 1946 and 1971, global oil reserves grew ninefold, supported by 
the discovery of massive fields in the Middle East.7 The petroleum boom enabled a rapid rise 
in energy use: per capita global oil consumption quadrupled.8 This was possible because 
of a stable low oil price of less than $20 a barrel in today’s money.9 As a result, by 1971, the 
energy intensity of GDP was at an all-time high of 13 megajoules per dollar of GDP in the 
United States, almost three times higher than today.10 However, as with wealth, energy had 
not yet gone global. By 1971, the 40 percent of the world living in low- and lower-middle-
income countries consumed an average of 4.4 gigajoules of energy per capita a year; in the 
United States that figure, at 317 gigajoules, was more than 70 times higher.11 While there 
were concerns about feeding a rapidly growing population, the Green Revolution, enabled 
by synthetic fertilizers (and other fossil fuel–based technologies), underpinned decades of 
growth in agricultural productivity. For instance, per capita production of cereals increased by 

7

On the cusp of a new era?almost 20 percent between 1961 and 1971.12 This growth was supported by a ninefold increase 
in global ammonia production in the 1950s and 1960s.13

In capitalization, the rebuilding and development of Europe and Japan from the ravages of 
war enabled robust supply and demand growth. Around the world, governments deleveraged 
wartime debts as their economies expanded, with the ratio of public debt to GDP in G-20 
countries declining from 121 percent in 1946 to 32 percent in 1971.14

The Postwar Boom delivered a golden age of productivity growth, driven largely by the spread 
of the “great inventions” of the previous decades whose dissemination had been hampered 
by war. However, the regions then known as the Third World grew more slowly—GDP growth 
of 3.3 percent per year against an OECD average of 4.8 percent per year—with the effect that 
the 20 percent of the global population in OECD countries accounted for 59 percent of GDP 
growth in the era.15

This golden age could not last forever. Subterranean tensions were building that contributed 
to the earthquake of the 1970s. European dissatisfaction with the “exorbitant privilege” 
of the Bretton Woods system enjoyed by the United States, combined with dwindling US 
gold reserves, exposed tensions in the global monetary system.16 Decolonization, with its 
emphasis on self-determination, was at odds with a carbon-hungry economy that relied on 
resources extracted from poorer, producing nations with little sovereignty over their natural 
endowments. And by 1970, the one-off changes and innovations that had driven progress 
throughout the era appeared to have declined in intensity and frequency in the West—the 
transition from animal transportation to highways and jet engines, from domestic toil to 
domestic appliances, and from rural life to cities could happen only once.17

The Era of Contention (1971–89)

The early 1970s bore witness to seismic shifts as new actors rose up to claim their place in 
the global order (1971–73), particularly as the shift to regional self-determination created 
tensions in a now international resource system. In 1973, an oil shock contributed to a 
yearlong recession that hobbled large and heavily oil-dependent Western economies when 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) nations sought to leverage the power 
of what lay beneath their earth. At the same time, the expensive and difficult war in Vietnam 
divided the United States and demonstrated the limits of its power. There was increasing 
strain on the peg to the US dollar and its convertibility to gold.18 The gold standard ended 
when US President Richard Nixon suddenly closed the gold window and the age of fiat 
money began—a seeming footnote of history that went on to become the basis of ongoing 
US hegemony, financialization, and global interconnectedness. The West underwent an 
inflationary recession, and momentum shifted toward the East: Japan’s GDP overtook 
Germany’s. In a historic move, Nixon visited China after 25 years of noncommunication 
between the two great powers.19

The era that followed the pivotal transition of 1971–73 had a different but similarly consistent 
effect across domains. The mood of this era was less buoyant as people and institutions 
struggled to adjust to a slowdown and persistent inflation, shifting from the rapid growth of 
the preceding years.

In the world order, the terrain continued to be shaped by changing US economic power. The 
world moved to a floating exchange rate system and fiat money as the US dollar lost its peg 
to gold. The intensity of the Cold War waxed and waned. The rapprochement of Nixon and 
Leonid Brezhnev and the détente was followed by deteriorating relations after the Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.20 Stockpiles of nuclear warheads increased throughout the 
era, but at a slower rate, and by 1987, the two sides had more than 60,000 nuclear warheads 
in total.21 Many Western economies struggled—for example, the United Kingdom required a 
$3.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in 1976. Meanwhile, non-Western 
countries such as Japan emerged as economic powerhouses but not geopolitical ones, 
while China opened up to the outside world. Over time, Western economies responded by 
undertaking significant market-based reforms of their own, such as those led by UK Prime

McKinsey Global InstituteMinister Margaret Thatcher and US President Ronald Reagan, who laid the foundations for 
the rise of markets globally over subsequent years, culminating in the last of the three eras 
discussed here: the Era of Markets.

In technology platforms, consumer electronics became widespread in the West. By the end 
of the era—but not at its start—the majority of US households had a clothes dryer, an electric 
stove, a color television, air conditioning, and a microwave.22 Meanwhile, the foundations of the 
computer age were laid with the advent of network technology and communication protocols, 
the widespread use of transistors, and the first commercial production of a microprocessor: 
the Intel 4004 four-bit central processing unit. In 1971, fewer than 30 hosts were running the 
Advanced Research Projects Agency Network—the precursor to the internet—a figure that 
topped 150,000 by the end of 1989.23 However, the seeds of global connectivity would not 
fully germinate for another generation.

In demographic forces, the era was shaped by rising female empowerment. The widespread 
adoption of the contraceptive pill led to historic alterations in family and social structures, 
with female economic participation becoming the norm in the West. In the United States, from 
1970 to 1990, the gap between male and female labor participation rates fell by nearly 20 
percentage points.24 Related to this, Western fertility rates fell further and started dropping 
below the replacement rate. Globally, child mortality continued to fall, enabled by rising levels 
of female education and improving basic public health infrastructure.25 This contributed 
significantly to rising life expectancy; the average person lived eight years longer. However, 
the benefits of economic progress continued to accrue more quickly in the West, and, as a 
result, between-country inequality peaked.26

In resource and energy systems, the new landscape was one of supply crises, particularly 
in oil after Middle Eastern nations asserted sovereignty over their reserves. The world 
responded to the global oil shock by diversifying into nuclear and gas, boosting non-OPEC 
oil production, developing coal basins in China, and investing in energy efficiency. Economic 
growth became notably less energy intensive. By the end of the era, 10 percent fewer 
joules were required per dollar of GDP.27 Growth in per capita energy consumption slowed 
from 3.5 percent per year in the late 1960s to 1.3 percent per year in the 1970s.28 Ongoing 
improvements in agricultural productivity enabled by energy, chemicals, and machines led 
to increasing global food supply while increasing the amount of labor available off the farm—
despite the 1972 Club of Rome report warning of the limits to growth. 29 In Africa and Asia, per 
capita calorie consumption increased by 8 percent and 21 percent, respectively.30 There was 
enough food in each continent for no one to go hungry. Good governance became the biggest 
bottleneck, as the Ethiopian famine of the 1980s tragically demonstrated.

In capitalization, the landscape was one of stagflation in the West. Inflation hit double digits, 
and many economies suffered from recession and high unemployment; towering interest 
rates were used to try to tame inflation, and the end of the gold standard corresponded with a 
gradual releveraging of public balance sheets.

Economic growth in the West sputtered during this era. Productivity growth in G-7 countries 
more than halved, from 4.3 percent in the 1960s to 1.8 percent in the 1980s.31 However, GDP 
growth in East Asia started on a long upward trajectory. With its transition from a planned 
economy to a market-based economy starting in 1978, China switched from lower growth to 
hypergrowth—a pivot that went on to fundamentally change the world.

Again, tensions were mounting that would lead to a shift in the landscape. The foundations 
for a more deregulated market-based economy had been laid in the West, exemplified by the 
policies of Reagan and Thatcher. The Soviet Union’s rival model was slowly imploding. The 
groundwork for a new digital age was set.

On the cusp of a new era?The Era of Markets (1989–2019)

Between 1989 and 1991, the Berlin Wall fell, the Soviet Union broke up, and Europe’s 
geopolitical deck was reshuffled, with global consequences. Pro-democracy movements 
swept across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992, signaling a 
leap forward in Europe’s economic and political integration. China, after halting progress, fully 
recommitted to its market reforms with Deng Xiaoping’s Southern Tour of 1992. Meanwhile, 
the Gulf War became a showcase of US military power. In the technological sphere, the World 
Wide Web was born in 1989, creating the scaffold for a digital revolution.

And so began the era that is most familiar to many of us, the years that have been our recent 
home. Again, this era had its own distinctive landscape. The world has changed a lot—but 
analysis of global trends during this period finds the same constants echoing throughout: 
deepening global connections enabled by a US-led order, computerization and connectivity, 
and the rise of Asia, to name a few.

In the world order, one prominent feature was global integration, the foundations for which 
had been laid in the 1980s as more economies drove market-based economic reform.32 
Global supply chains spread rapidly, built on factor-cost arbitrage and cooperative economic 
rules. 33 They were supported by the newly formed World Trade Organization, which fostered 
multilateral reductions in trade barriers. Total trade grew to the equivalent of, on average, 
56 percent of countries’ GDP in 2019.34 In particular, from 1990 to 2008, trade grew at almost 
double the pace of GDP.35 China’s role in trade became truly global. By the end of the era, 
China was a top-five import or export partner for economies accounting for 99 percent of 
global GDP.36 In Europe, integration deepened, spurred by the creation of the economic union 
and eventually the monetary union.

A second key feature was relative unipolarity around a US-led neoliberal, democratic order. 
The dissolution of the Soviet Union had reshaped the bipolar world into a unipolar one, 
centered on an unchallenged United States.37 Democracy spread, and, globally, military 
conflict deaths fell to their lowest levels in recent history.38

In technology platforms, mobile phones and the internet became the norm in the West 
and, eventually, around the world, enabled by the persistent march of Moore’s law, which 
made processing technology powerful, cheap, and ubiquitous.39 By 2019, 67 percent of the 
world’s population had a mobile phone—a new majority.40 Fifty-four percent had access to the 
internet.41 At the start of the Era of Markets, both numbers had been close to zero. Even “plain 
old telephone system” landlines peaked at two for every ten people globally, easily eclipsed 
by internet protocol and mobile-based technologies. 42 Digital became the means to store the 
world’s information. At the start of the era, almost 99 percent of the world’s data was stored 
on analog media; now, effectively 100 percent of the world’s data is in digital form.43 More 
recently, disruptive transversal technologies like applied AI, bioengineering, and immersive 
reality technologies accelerated in innovation, production, and adoption, with large potential 
for value creation in coming years.44

In demographic forces, the march of urbanization led an additional two billion people into 
cities, and city dwellers outnumbered those living in rural areas. By 2019, 56 percent of the 
global population was urban—another new majority. The number of large cities more than 
doubled, from 274 to 579, with 81 percent of them outside the West.45 Fertility rates continued 
to fall globally, converging toward smaller family sizes. The fertility rate in Latin America and 
Asia fell to 1.9 and 2.1 births per woman, respectively—below the replacement rate—with 
only women in Africa having larger families, with 4.4 children on average. Life expectancy 
continued to rise. During this era, the average person gained an additional nine years of life. 
Of course, the flip side of this was that the world aged. Likely for the first time in history, the 
global median age topped 30.46 Falling fertility and rising life expectancy were supported by 
people becoming more educated and less poor. The secondary education enrollment ratio 
increased to 76 percent.47 By 2019, 53 percent of the world’s population had income above 
the World Bank’s highest poverty line of $6.85 per day.48 As a result of rising Asian prosperity, 
hundreds of millions were lifted out of poverty.49 However, large development opportunities 
still remained. By the end of the era, in sub-Saharan Africa 35 percent of people lived in 

10

McKinsey Global Instituteextreme poverty; 35 percent of adults could not read and write; 59 percent lived rurally; 
and 54 percent did not have access to electricity.50 Notably, these rates had all improved 
throughout the era, but given population growth, absolute numbers remained high. Reasons 
for optimism persisted. For example, between 2000 and 2019, countries such as Botswana, 
Rwanda, and Uganda registered 20-year increases in years of life expectancy.51

Viewed through a country lens, the world has become more equal as developing economies 
have narrowed the income and wealth gap with their advanced counterparts. For example, 
high-income countries’ share of global wealth fell slightly, from 80 percent in 2000 to 
71 percent in 2014; the share of middle-income countries such as China and India rose from 14 
to 22 percent.52 At the same time, in the West, and viewed more locally, there was a growing 
sense that the economic benefits of the era were not being equitably shared. Between 2005 
and 2014, the real incomes of about two-thirds of households in 25 advanced economies were 
flat or declined—with the risk of corrosive economic and social consequences. For the first 
time in recent Western history, the assumption that each generation would be better off than 
the previous generation faltered.53 Moreover, within advanced economies, wealth and income 
inequality has risen. Measured by the mean-to-median wealth ratio, wealth inequality has 
increased in two-thirds of OECD member economies since 2000. In income terms, the top 
1 percent in the OECD almost doubled its share of total pretax income, from 6 percent in 1980 
to about 11 percent in 2014.54 Such trends—the result of, among other things, the rise in global 
interconnectedness, the increasing prominence of knowledge work, and high asset price 
growth underpinned by cheap money—have sown societal discord in the West, undermining 
the social contract and powering the rise of polarized politics and nonmainstream 
electoral success.55

In resource and energy systems, fossil fuels became ever more abundant as ongoing 
technological improvements and a flood of investment brought new basins into the global mix, 
including, for instance, deep-sea oil, intercontinental pipelines, shale gas and oil (particularly 
in the United States), and liquefied natural gas. During this era, annual global consumption 
of oil, coal, and gas increased by 44, 67, and 108 percent, respectively.56 Per capita energy 
consumption grew significantly. Globally, the average person now consumes 76 gigajoules, 
equivalent to about 580 gallons of gasoline, a year.57 However, the energy intensity of GDP 
continued to fall, with 36 percent fewer joules required per dollar at the end of the era than at 
its start.

This growth competed with a new feature of the terrain: the increasing awareness of 
potentially irreversible climate damage. A race to salvage global habitability began, and the 
Paris Agreement laid out a path to reducing climate damage. This led to some notable results. 
The move toward renewables has been tangible. By 2019, a significant majority—72 percent—
of net new annual electricity-generating capacity globally came from renewables.58 
Countries around the world have committed (in pledge, policy, or law) to net zero, and these 
commitments cover about 83 percent of countries (by terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions).59 
However, such efforts did not act as a real constraint on demand or supply. For example, over 
the course of the era, China’s energy demand underwent a step change. Per capita energy 
consumption in China jumped from 26 gigajoules to 100 gigajoules, driving a global increase 
in per capita energy consumption of 20 percent.60 Looking at supply, the share of energy from 
renewables grew slightly, but fossil fuel consumption rose further in absolute terms. By the 
end of the era, 84 percent of the global gigajoules consumed still came from fossil energy 
sources, a figure that remained essentially unchanged over the past 30 years.61 Meanwhile, 
electricity—the current focus of so much effort to decarbonize—continued to provide a 
relatively small proportion of the world’s final energy consumption: 13 percent at the start of 
the era and 20 percent at its end.62

Demand for food and materials also grew explosively. As people around the world became 
wealthier, their appetite for meat grew. Over the course of the era, meat production in China 
tripled; in Brazil, it quadrupled.63 The surge in domestic animals came with a surge in crops 
to feed them—China’s corn production grew nearly threefold and Brazil’s fivefold, while 
production in the United States nearly doubled.64 And as countries developed, they built. 

11

On the cusp of a new era?Global steel production increased 2.4 times, driven by a 16-fold increase in China’s steel 
production.65 Cement production nearly quadrupled.66 Again, this was driven by China, which 
between 2011 and 2013 poured more concrete than the United States used in the entire 20th 
century.67 All of this was supported, too, by plastics—packaging the world’s food and lining its 
buildings—whose annual production grew fourfold across the era.68 In this way, at the end of 
the era, human-made materials had reached a crossing point, weighing more than all the living 
biomass on Earth.69

In capitalization, one feature at least remained constant from the previous era—China’s 
growth. Propelled by prosperity and urbanization, hundreds of millions of people in China left 
agricultural employment to join the modern labor force. This led to a historically large supply 
shock of hundreds of millions of urbanites joining the global workforce, which, over time, 
evolved into robust demand growth from the burgeoning middle classes as well as a complete 
restructuring of global supply chains. For example, while China does not produce most of the 
world’s lithium, cobalt, manganese, or iron ore, it processes most of each.70

A second, new feature of the terrain was stable, low interest rates and inflation. The world 
experienced a record buildup in household, nonfinancial corporate, and government debt, 
which, on average, by 2020, accounted for 256 percent of each country’s GDP, up from close 
to 100 percent when countries started releveraging in the 1970s.71 This effect was particularly 
pronounced in the case of public debt in advanced economies. In 2019, 57 percent (by GDP 
weight) of advanced economies had government debt of more than 100 percent of GDP.72 
The global financial crisis was a midpoint breather in the leverage race, but ultimately the 
massive monetary expansion in response kept fueling long-term asset values and debt. 
Indeed, between 2000 and 2020, the market value of the global balance sheet tripled, from 
$150 trillion or about four times GDP in 2000 to about $500 trillion or about six times GDP in 
2020.73 One small but important piece of the growing balance sheet was—and is—intangible 
assets such as intellectual property and data. Investment share in intangibles in the US and 
European economies increased 29 percent in the past 25 years, a change associated with 
increasing total factor productivity in economies.74

In this era, China’s growth supported an economic shift in global growth away from high-
income countries. Low- and middle-income countries are now, for the first time, responsible 
for the majority of global GDP growth.75 For most of the era, China sustained top-gear GDP 
growth of close to 10 percent a year in real terms, an achievement unprecedented for a 
country of its size.76 Moreover, China was joined by India and some Southeast Asian emerging 
markets entering a high-growth gear, with annual GDP growth of 5.0 to 7.5 percent for most 
of the era.77 These stellar growth rates started to ease only toward the end of the 2010s. In 
advanced economies, GDP growth was more muted, and the productivity boom of the late 
1990s started tapering off in the 2010s.78

At the end of this third era, the world was very clearly globalized, urban, and, in aggregate, 
very prosperous. New majorities abounded (Exhibit 3). Without question, today’s world is 
an improved version. At the turn of the 1990s, the world had much more inequality, with 
significant energy-poor, food-poor, and capital-poor populations, more people living rural 
lives outside of the orbit of global markets, and more people uneducated and disconnected 
from one another and from the world’s information. The peaceful progress of the world 
enabled us to address this inequality and keep the gains that have been made.

Here, too, one can identify tensions, imbalance, and complexity mounting with sufficient 
force to create ruptures. While markets had supported remarkable growth and progress, a 
narrative was emerging that fault lines were beginning to show and limits to free markets were 
being exposed.79 COVID-19—and its role in the expansion of the role of government—has 
passed its worst stages, but it leaves a legacy of higher debt as well as a rapid acceleration in 
digitization. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine displaced any remaining complacency about global 
energy (and food) supply, the threat of unbound autocracy, and the limits of global institutions. 
The returning specter of inflation and the associated rapid monetary tightening are redolent 
of a different age. The huge improvement in living standards has drawn billions into the 
modern energy system (without which there is no modern life as we know it), but the shift has 

12

McKinsey Global Institutemeant that we approach the end of our carbon budget. The financial system that enabled 
global investment, underpinned by the global reserve fiat currency and turbocharged money 
expansion, has created potential vulnerabilities in record leverage on the liabilities side and 
record valuations on the asset side. So, yes, the current earthquakes may seem to have come 
suddenly, but as in other times of transition, they reflect a longer buildup of tensions, which we 
are now forced to resolve in the next era.

2. Imagining  
the next era

What form the next era might take—and what key decisions could help to shape the new 
terrain—are uncertain in this unusually febrile context. The major question on the minds of 
many political leaders and CEOs right now is whether we are in danger of a repeat of the 
1970s and 1980s Era of Contention, whose tremors in so many ways remind us of current 
times: an energy shock, a negative supply shock, the return of inflation, a new monetary era, 
rising geopolitical assertion, resource competition, and slowing productivity in the West.

Could we be overblowing that comparison and the momentousness of current events? There 
is a fundamental difference between today and other crises during the Era of Markets. Most 
of them were demand-driven cycles when confidence crashed; examples include the dot-com 
bust, financial crises in Asia, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Citizens and businesses retrench 
and economic activity falters, but when confidence returns and spending and growth resume, 
the dangers diminish. However, today we are seeing a supply shortage—and geopolitical 
tensions around supply—in the context of strong demand. The result is inflation, and the 
specter of inflationary recession.

While a demand cycle is colored by psychology, a supply cycle is physical and takes much 
more time and effort to resolve.80 Can the challenges surfacing during the current pivotal 
transition be resolved faster and less painfully than was possible after the 1970s earthquake? 
The aftershocks of the 1970s took almost 20 years to settle down and only on the back of 
a rigorous long-term response. It included investing in energy independence (consider, for 
example, rising non-OPEC production in Alaska, the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico), the 
growth of a less energy-dependent economy, and painful monetary stabilization, including 
double-digit interest rates and associated recessions under the Volcker-era US Federal 
Reserve. Strong political leaders from Reagan to Thatcher to Deng emerged from the 
maelstrom, often by applying tough—and unpopular—medicine.

Given that the average CEO would have been a teenager during the 1970s and 1980s, it is 
unlikely that many of today’s leaders have a playbook for how to navigate this confluence 
of forces and the unresolved questions that need to be negotiated. Moreover, differences 
between now and the earthquake of the early 1970s only magnify cause for concern: 
today’s world is much more globally entwined, much more leveraged, and much more 
carbon constrained.

So let us go back to the five domains. Within each, there are possible directions of travel 
or trends that could determine the flavor of the coming era. However, in each domain are 
unresolved questions—perhaps many of them—and choices to be made about which path to 
take. Very different outcomes are still on the table (Exhibit 4).

McKinsey Global InstituteWorld order

Potential direction of travel

 — The unipolar and settled world order of the most recent era has become multipolar 

and proactive.81 As an illustration, the gap between the share of global material capability 
held by US-aligned powers and China is fewer than ten percentage points, smaller 
than the gap between US-aligned powers and the Soviet Union during the Cold War 
(Exhibit 5).82 A second example is the slow spread of democracy: the share of the world 
living in a democracy topped 50 percent in the 1990s but stalled thereafter.83

These deeper trends have been accelerated and highlighted by a series of tremors in 
recent years. In February 2022, China’s rise as an economic power reached a crossroads 
as its GDP overtook that of the European Union (EU); at the end of March 2022, India 
passed the United Kingdom to become the world’s fifth-largest economy by GDP. At the 
same time, peace in Europe—and the global economy—was rocked by Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine. Western-led condemnation was swift, but China, India, and 33 other states 
abstained from a UN resolution to condemn Russia.84 Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic 
delivered the largest global economic shock since World War II and prompted an overall 
expansion of the state just about everywhere, at least for the period of the pandemic, as 
public intervention and leadership came roaring back.85

 — Increasing multipolarity may support a trend toward realignment into regionally 
and ideologically aligned groups. Global integration through flows of trade, people, 
capital, and, increasingly, intangibles remains a force in the world. However, some 
underlying trends have been evolving. For example, trade intensity has stabilized. After 
growing rapidly from the mid-1990s to the global financial crisis, merchandise trade as a 
share of GDP has remained flat over the past decade.86 Realignment may be seen in the

On the cusp of a new era?technological sphere, too, with a decline in global interoperability and a splintering of the 
tech stack as the availability of major platforms and technologies increasingly depends on 
political lines that are drawn.87

Again, these trends have led to some tremors in the past two years that signal regional 
realignment. In trade, for example, as many regional trade agreements were notified in 
2021 as in the previous five years combined.88 The Regional Comprehensive Economic 
Partnership, a free trade agreement among Asia–Pacific nations, came into force in 
January 2022, creating the world’s largest trading bloc. 89 In geopolitics, as a consequence 
of the Ukraine war, Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO is undergoing ratification, 
marking the largest addition to NATO’s material capability since 2004.

 — Years of relative moderation in internal and international politics may give way 
to more political polarization, both internally and between blocs. Internationally, 
a persistent gap separates liberal democracies and some more autocratic regimes.90 
Moreover, since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the number of active sanctions—a 
marker of tension between states—has hit an all-time high.91 All this occurred against 
a backdrop of increasing strain between people and institutions, particularly in the 
West. The rise of polarization in US politics has been well studied.92 Between 2010 
and 2020, Europe witnessed a near doubling of the share of the popular vote taken 
by polarizing political parties.93 Citizens’ protests are on the rise.94 Liberal democracy 
faces not only increasing internal tensions but also opposition from rising powers with 
alternative ideologies.95

Unresolved questions

 — What might the multipolarity of the world look like in practice? Will the economy 
remain global in nature, and will we find new, workable mechanisms to cooperate 
beyond the economy? At one end of the spectrum, there could be a gradual transition 
to a multipolar order where blocs develop autonomous control over limited, strategically 
important resources and capabilities—such as energy systems and semiconductor 
manufacturing—while global collaboration continues more generally. At the other end, 
there could be a more abrupt transition with much more limited collaboration between 
blocs across all dimensions, combined with heightened geopolitical tensions.

 — How effectively will global and local institutions and leadership adapt to, and shape, 
this different world order? On the one hand, global institutions could play a powerful 
and pivotal role in managing an orderly transition. Domestically, institutions could make 
the appropriate decisions and investments to thrive in a growing world. On the other hand, 
global institutions could be sidelined by international blocs while, domestically, short-
sighted decision making leads to a misallocation of resources, exacerbating the strain 
on society.

Technology platforms

Potential direction of travel

 — Key drivers of previous eras—such as Moore’s law and the spread of digital—may slow 
in the coming years. The physical limits of Moore’s law are being approached—consider 
the atomic limit of transistor size—while the expense of adhering to Moore’s law is growing 
exponentially.96 However, new dimensions of semiconductor innovation may extend 
advances in computing power. A deceleration in hardware innovation may lead to greater 
emphasis on software development. In the Era of Markets, cellphones and the internet 
far outspread fixed-line phones and PCs in adoption. However, a saturation point may 
be near. While smartphones will become the norm even in the least developed countries, 
global volume growth will end as demand falls in the West; indeed, smartphone shipments 
have been in decline globally since 2018.97

18

McKinsey Global Institute — A set of transversal technologies, including applied AI, may shape the next era. 

New and emerging transversal technologies, such as applied AI, bioengineering, and 
immersive-reality technologies, are attracting tens and hundreds of billions of dollars of 
annual investment, often with double-digit investment growth rates (Exhibit 6).98 These 
technologies may counteract the slowdown suggested above. For example, developments 
in quantum computing may spur the next big S-curve of development. And, in the digitally 
saturated world, frontier technologies such as the metaverse will begin to enter the 
mainstream.99 Focusing on AI in particular, the wide range of potential applications has led 
some to claim it will underpin a Fourth Industrial Revolution.100 AI innovation, as measured 
by AI-based patent applications, grew at a rate of more than 75 percent a year between 
2015 and 2022.101 Accelerating the preexisting trend, the pandemic propelled even faster 
adoption of AI and automation.102

On the cusp of a new era? — Technology may move to the forefront of geopolitical competition and power. 

Technology is permeating virtually every sector of the economy, determining competitive 
dynamics. At a time when geopolitics are shifting in unpredictable and potentially 
challenging ways, this makes strategic autonomy on critical technologies an ever more 
salient topic. A race for AI primacy between major powers is under way, with many recently 
questioning the belief that the United States leads its peers in AI capabilities.103 There 
is competition for influence in global standard-setting bodies; consider, for example, 
China’s ambition to take a more leading role through the China Standards 2035 strategy.104 
There are concerns about the security implications of globalized hardware flows as 
well as the selective block on exporting the world’s most sophisticated chip-making 
machines, produced only by a single company in the Netherlands.105 And cyberattacks 
as a tool of state power have increased. Between 2020 and 2022, 320 state-sponsored 
cyberattacks were publicly reported, nearly as many as in the full decade prior.106

Unresolved questions

 — What impact will the next wave of technologies have on work and social order? AI 

technologies will present both opportunities for and challenges to the nature of society 
and work, the balance between digital and physical domains, the financial system, and 
the interplay between humans and machines.107 Many forecast that AI may lead to job 
disruption rather than job destruction.108 However, the threat of losing good jobs and 
the risk of leaving behind certain groups remains.109 Depending on the choices made, a 
smooth transition to an AI-augmented world could be engineered, or technology could 
fracture the social order.110

 — How will technology, institutions, and geopolitics interact? Technological innovation 
has become the crucible of global competition. Emerging questions concern the nature 
and extent of data localization, the balance—and sharing—of critical technological 
capabilities between powers, the role of technology in changing institutions, and the 
future frameworks for standard setting. Potential future paths range from healthy 
competition between powers under a broad framework of shared standards and 
breakthroughs to a decoupled world with a concentration of technological power held 
within blocs.

Demographic forces

Potential direction of travel

 — A young world will evolve into an aging, urban world. The world is aging as never before 
as a result of declining fertility and rising life expectancy. Globally, the world has reached 
the plateau of “peak child”—it is unlikely that there will ever be many more under-fives 
alive than there are today. This demographic shift is not confined to the West: it is set to 
become an Asian phenomenon, too. In China, for example, the working-age population 
is already falling, and the old-age dependency ratio is projected to surpass that of the 
United States in the next 15 years. Africa, conversely, will be the source of more than half 
of global population growth in the coming decades. By the early 2030s, the continent is 
expected to have a larger working-age population than China or India and a median age 
of 20.111 As Africa, the young continent, continues to grow even as populations elsewhere 
shrink, could it finally enter into a sustained period of rising prosperity?

The world will continue to urbanize, too. In 2021, the world hit “peak rural”—all future 
population growth is projected to come from urban centers as rural populations decline 
(Exhibit 7).112 Again, urban growth will come from outside the West. Whereas Europe and 
North America are projected to gain 13 large cities by 2035, Africa and Asia are expected 
to gain about 50 and 100, respectively.113

 — The age of communicable diseases may give way to an age of noncommunicable 
diseases. An aging world brings a shift from communicable diseases to often chronic, 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), the sizable impact of COVID-19 notwithstanding.

McKinsey Global InstituteIn developing countries, rates of death and disability due to NCDs have been falling.114 
However, an aging population means the absolute size of the NCD burden has been 
surging—a change for which developing countries are often ill-equipped.115 In some 
high-income countries, most notably the United States, rates of death and disability due 
to NCDs are increasing. Indeed, the combination of the NCD burden and the COVID-19 
pandemic—which led to an estimated 18 million excess deaths globally—contributed to a 
2.7-year drop in life expectancy in the United States between 2019 and 2021, regressing 
to the average life expectancy seen in 1995.116 The combination of the NCD burden and 
rising old-age dependency ratios is likely to increase demands on the welfare state across 
the development spectrum, putting further upward pressure on health expenditure 
and pensions.

 — Inequality within countries may increasingly challenge the social fabric.117 Within 

countries, the ratio of the top 10 percent measured by income and the bottom 50 percent 
is at the highest level since its peak at the start of the 20th century.118 In the United States, 
trust in government is at historic lows.119 In Europe, citizens’ trust in government is at stable 
lows.120 The link between rising inequality and falling trust in institutions may not be causal. 
Nonetheless, a narrative is increasingly circulating that the economic benefits of society 
are captured by elites, enabled by reinforcing institutions.

Unresolved questions

 — How will countries, institutions, and individuals adapt to demographic changes? 
Managing the transition to an older society will require investment in, and supporting 
structures for, an equitable balance. There are choices to be made, for example, about the 
extent to which society prioritizes adding years to life and life to years—taking the view 
of health as an investment—rather than investing in other demands on expenditure.121 In 
other words, the world could age gracefully, with healthy, productive later years becoming 
the norm, or old-age dependency could impose heavy social and economic costs on the

Europe, for example, and growing ones in Africa and India will affect their economies.

 — How will capital and institutions respond to rising inequality? Here, too, a spectrum 
of outcomes is plausible. Institutions and policies could facilitate a more equitable and 
inclusive distribution of the fruits of society in the interest of sustainable growth, and the 
narrative on inequality could be tempered, or within-country inequalities could continue 
to rise, exploited by destabilizing political forces that undermine the perceived legitimacy 
of institutions.

Resource and energy systems

Potential direction of travel

 — Spending on fossil fuels will shift to spending on replacing them, but overall 

investment may struggle to keep pace with growing energy needs. The near-term 
energy landscape will be shaped by recent underinvestment. At its heart lies a paradox: 
the current pace of renewable energy infrastructure investment is too slow for the goals 
of the Paris Agreement to be met, but if those goals are not to be achieved, then current 
investment in fossil fuel infrastructure is too low to make up the shortfall.122 Between 
2014 and 2022, investment in energy infrastructure stagnated (Exhibit 8). Spending on 
renewables would need ramp up at four times the 2015–22 rate to be on the path to net 
zero.123 Oil drilling has not responded to recent high prices as markedly as in the past, 
likely due to concerns about fossil fuel investment.124 Indeed, recent years have seen 
a shortfall of more than $1 trillion of investment in energy infrastructure versus 2014 
levels, with a 33 percent drop in fossil fuel and nonrenewable power investment over the 
period.125 All of this is in stark contrast to the required additional annual global investment 
of as much as $3.5 trillion in low-emissions assets estimated to be needed to achieve net 
zero.126 Increased investment in renewables, fossil fuels, or both will be needed to meet 
global energy requirements. A combination of underinvestment and catch-up investment 
in both renewable and fossil fuel energy infrastructure could produce a prolonged 
period of higher prices. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the deeper trend of 
underinvestment manifested in tremors in the form of high price signals across energy 
commodities in late 2021.127

 — Resilience, feasibility, and affordability concerns may challenge the velocity of the 
transition to net zero. Energy security will become a key consideration in countries’ 
energy mix. In the short term, securing supply in the face of the energy shock triggered by 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may trump the goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
For example, €10 billion of investment in liquefied natural gas infrastructure is foreseen in 
Europe over the coming years to reduce reliance on pipeline gas.128 However, renewables, 
too, will play a role in bolstering energy security.129 When the current shock resolves, the 
trend toward increasing political commitments to net zero will likely resume. However, 
amid economic uncertainty, the strength of commitment to the spending required to 
achieve net zero is less certain—as are the technical feasibility and affordability of doing 
so. By some estimates, the amount of land needed for decarbonized electricity production 
may need to increase two- to threefold.130 This would entail an incremental global footprint 
similar in size to Mexico. By the end of 2020, the world had the grid-level battery capacity 
to store only about one minute of its global electricity consumption.131 And this is just for 
electricity, which, as noted, accounts for only 20 percent of global energy consumption. 
The picture is no brighter in other sectors: only two of the International Energy Agency’s 
55 clear energy progress indicators are green (“on track”); in its aggregated rating system, 
the fuel supply sectors, transport, buildings, and industry are red (“not on track”).132 
Meanwhile, demand for currently irreplaceable steel, cement, ammonia, and plastics—
together accounting for 25 percent of fossil fuel–related emissions—will continue to grow 
as the world completes its development pathway.133 Of course, for those who can exploit 
the trends and implement solutions to these gnarly problems, a big business prize awaits.

McKinsey Global Institute — Critical resources for the future economy, including minerals and food, may become 
increasingly important in economics and geopolitics. In recent years, supply-demand 
imbalances for critical minerals, such as cobalt, have radically changed price signals 
and driven substitution and innovation. To meet demand for copper and nickel alone, an 
estimated $250 billion to $350 billion cumulative capital expenditure may be required by 
2030.134 Some estimate that to enable 50 percent fleet replacement with electric vehicles 
by 2050, consistent with a net-zero scenario, global production of lithium and cobalt 
would have to increase approximately 20-fold, and nickel 30-fold.135 Copper supplies, 
too, are expected to come under strain.136 However, the need for critical minerals presents 
multiple challenges. Sources and processing capabilities for many key minerals are highly 
concentrated in just a few countries. For example, China produces most of the world’s 
rare earth elements and refines most of its lithium and cobalt.137 The concentration of and 
demand for critical minerals may only heighten competition between global powers.138 
Diversification is possible, but it takes time and very significant and sustained investment. 
Moreover, processing requires technologies and human capital that may take many 
years to develop.139 The environmental and social toll associated with some of these 
developments poses yet another hurdle to many potential projects.140 And while many want

dug in their back yard. In late 2021, Serbia revoked the mining license for what would have 
become one of the world’s largest lithium mines on environmental grounds.141

Beyond minerals, the invasion of Ukraine highlighted how millions—particularly the world’s 
most vulnerable—rely on global flows of food. Key grain crops are perhaps surprisingly 
concentrated in just a few breadbasket regions. The top ten grains exporters accounted 
for about 70 percent of global exports in 2019. The Middle East and North Africa region, 
for instance, relies on imports for 60 percent of its grains (and wheat largely comes from 
Ukraine and southern Russia). Moreover, key fertilizers are highly concentrated in just a 
few producer countries. In the case of potassium chloride, which accounts for most potash 
fertilizer, about 80 percent of exports originate in Canada, Russia, and Belarus.142 This 
leaves importing countries vulnerable to disruption. The issue of global food security was 
climbing the global agenda because of early evidence of the impact of climate change, but 
disrupted supplies in Europe have only served to accentuate vulnerabilities.143

Unresolved questions

 — How will the world navigate an affordable, resilient, and feasible path to climate 

stability? Net zero by 2050 is an ambition unprecedented in scale. Achieving it depends 
on significant investment. The incremental annual global investment required is estimated 
to be as much as $3.5 trillion.144 It will also require rapid cross-sectoral innovation. 
To drive the required investment and innovation, supportive economic and political 
frameworks need to be in place. Again, therefore, many outcomes are on the table. Global 
collaboration and effective investment could spur innovation and deliver an affordable and 
resilient path to net zero. Conversely, progress could stall and innovation founder, leading 
nations, individuals, and the biosphere to undertake a difficult adaptation to a climatically 
different world.

 — What dynamics will play out between those who have critical resources and those 

who do not? The salience of this question derives from recent global events, but it is one 
that has been asked for centuries. In the most recent era, market-based systems and 
global interconnectedness supported relatively peaceful and efficient exchange. One path 
leads this to continue, bolstered by improved mechanisms to address local environmental 
and human impacts; another path leads to imbalances in concentrations of power whereby 
either resource owners or resource buyers pay disproportionate and disruptive costs, 
economic or otherwise.

Capitalization

Potential direction of travel

 — Economic growth rates may normalize. One billion people lived in economies enjoying 
hypergrowth in recent decades. In the next era, it is unlikely that there will be more top-
gear catch-up growth from large economies because the world has converged to the 
same productivity curve. Although China’s GDP overtook that of the EU in early 2022, 
the economy moved out of top gear for growth for the first time in almost 40 years.145 
Meanwhile, productivity growth has continued to slow in advanced economies, falling 
to its lowest level in the postwar period.146 Capital-labor ratios—as approximated by the 
agricultural proportion of labor—in emerging economies are converging with those in the 
West.147 Lower growth and productivity may contribute to a global economic slowdown, 
and the end of the large, positive supply shock in global production may make inflation 
even harder to rein in.

 — Growing leverage and credit may evolve into balance sheet stress. Economies could 
be under pressure to deleverage historically high levels of debt.148 Total debt in advanced 
economies is at its highest levels since the end of World War II—in G-20 countries, the 
ratio of total debt to GDP is over 300 percent (Exhibit 9).149 The postwar deleveraging 
approach, namely to “outgrow” the debt, may be more challenging in the context of low

values relative to income are nearly 50 percent higher than long-run averages. This rise is 
underpinned by real estate, which accounts for two-thirds of global net worth. These high 
valuations are at risk of reverting to their historical means.151

The tremors here are already widely felt. In some economies, inflation had already hit 
40-year highs by September 2022, triggering a rise in nominal interest rates alongside 
historically high debt levels—raising the specter, once again, of an inflationary recession, 
but this time with radically higher leverage in both the public and private sectors. And 
there are signals that the current economic climate is destabilizing emerging markets, 
which are especially vulnerable to changing global economic conditions.152

 — The OECD century is giving way to the Asian century. This shift is driven by a confluence 

of factors across domains, but its significance may be felt most in how it shapes the 
drivers of supply and demand, finance and wealth, in the next era. This confluence of 
factors includes the multipolar world order with China as a major power. It includes the 
demographic shift toward Asia—in 2030, India, China, Indonesia, and Pakistan will 
represent four of the world’s five largest working-age populations.153 And it includes the 
shift in GDP growth; Southern Asia was the world’s fastest-growing region in GDP in 
2015–19.154 While a shift toward Asia appears likely to continue, the future Asian models 
for economic success, and whether and how they will differ from the Western paradigm, 
are less clear.155

Unresolved questions

 — Will we find the next productivity engine to drive growth? Labor productivity growth in 
G-7 countries decelerated for almost the entirety of the Era of Markets. The world could 
identify and fire up the next productivity engine and double down on growth enablers, or a 
slower rate of growth could become the norm.156

 — Will the rise and rise of the global balance sheet be reversed? Increasing leverage 

could be blunted or sustained by outgrowing debt or could lead to a difficult deleveraging 
across economies. Similarly, the growing global balance sheet could be sustained by 
accelerating GDP growth or increasing savings rates. Alternatively, asset prices could 
revert to the historical mean through a painful devaluation.

3. How can leaders think 
about the road ahead?

The current vantage point—looking at a future that could be less cohesive or less prosperous—
may invite pessimism, but looking back over the past 80 years gives us a compelling case 
for optimism, too. Negativism should not overwhelm effective decision making. In Western 
societies, in particular, a chronic bias toward pessimism and lack of faith in the liberal order 
seem endemic. Yet, as highlighted, the postwar period brought unprecedented progress and 
global development. Even now, when so many challenges have coincided in just a few short 
years, there are firm reasons to think the future will be bright.

First, many issues can, at least in part, be addressed now with current technologies if we are 
able to prioritize systematically and focus our efforts in our circle of control. In the case of the 
net-zero transition, for instance, leaders could address methane emissions first before moving 
on to other aspects of the climate challenge.157 In health, they could prioritize quick wins, one 
example being the Choosing Wisely campaign that is spreading around the world and aims to 
reduce low-value medical care.158 It is better to make a start than to be deterred from acting for 
fear of not achieving everything now.

Second, another source of optimism is that many breakthrough technologies are moving from 
science fiction to reality. Just one example is small modular nuclear reactors; the first US final 
certification of such a design is likely to be issued this year.159 The CRISPR gene editing tool is 
migrating from lab bench to bedside in order to tackle cancer and genetic disorders such as 
sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.160

Third, local, bottom-up bright spots act as a beacon for the path forward. Take, for instance, 
Finland’s education system, which leads the world with a less regimented, locally empowering 
approach.161 The Netherlands has developed an effective nurse-led model of holistic, 
continuous care for the elderly.162 Perhaps the most compelling example of effective action in 
the teeth of a deep global challenge was the response in many parts of the world to COVID-
19. Effective vaccines were developed faster than ever as the public and private sectors 
collaborated closely. Even in the face of war in Europe, governments and businesses have 
shown that they can mobilize, cooperate, and shift gears when the stakes are high. Just one 
instance of this is Germany’s fast-tracked creation of liquefied natural gas infrastructure to 
reduce its energy dependency on Russia.

If we are indeed in the early throes of a seismic shift—as the evidence appears to suggest—
what questions should leaders be asking themselves? They need both to prepare for the 
possibility of a new era and to position themselves to shape it:

 — Preparing for the next era. Am I prepared for the direction of travel, and to which 

questions am I most sensitive? What are the no-regret moves as opposed to actions that 
are dependent on the particular flavor of the era? Which leading indicators can act as early 
warning signals for an upcoming change of direction?163

 — Shaping the next era. How active should I be in trying to set the course through the 

unresolved questions? How can I help steer toward better outcomes?

Our next article in this series will address these questions.

It may be tempting to let pessimism diminish our aspirations and allow paralysis to jam up our 
decision making. The history laid out here, however, is a narrative of progress—and a new 
narrative of progress can still be shaped for the next era. As the famous adage goes, “Nobody 
can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.”
