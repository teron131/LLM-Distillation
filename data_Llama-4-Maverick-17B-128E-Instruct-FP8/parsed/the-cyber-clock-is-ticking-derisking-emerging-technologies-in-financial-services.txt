To better understand how institutions are 

approaching and prioritizing new technologies,  

we surveyed companies around the world about 

the applicability of ten emerging technologies to 

their businesses. 

The survey results reveal that financial-

services companies are not exploring all the 

relevance to their businesses. Among those 

respondents, six in ten reported that more than 

25 percent of their workload now resides in the 

cloud. This share will undoubtedly rise as cloud

and add new ones

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES 
CAN OFFER SIGNIFICANT 
BENEFITS, BUT THEY CAN 
ALSO EX ACERBATE EXISTING 
RISKS AND INTRODUCE 
NEW CYBER RISKS.

Cyber risk management is nothing new to 

financial-services companies, but the importance 

of a robust, comprehensive strategy has never 

been more critical and will only increase as 

institutions expand their technological footprint. 

Cyberattacks continue to increase, and financial-

services companies face well-funded, highly 

organized, and well-trained cyber criminals.  

These criminals are also adopting emerging 

technologies to aid in their attacks, including recent 

attacks utilizing gen AI as part of sophisticated 

phishing campaigns. 

Cyber incidents are increasing in both frequency 

and severity year over year, and institutions 

must stay vigilant in their capabilities to defend 

themselves and protect their assets and finances 

against electronic crime (Exhibit 3). Cyber 

incidents are increasing in both frequency and 

severity year over year, and institutions should 

stay vigilant in their capabilities to defend 

themselves and protect their assets and finances. 

According to the 2024 CrowdStrike global threat 

report, Electronic Crime (eCrime) continues 

to rise and led as the most pervasive threat in 

2023. Data-theft extortion also continues to rise, 

and 2023 saw a 76 percent increase in victims 

named on eCrime dedicated leak sites compared 

with 2022.2 As companies increase their use of 

technology, they are also increasing the number 

of avenues for a potential cyberattack by mature 

threat actors.

We further surveyed financial institutions to better 

understand what cyber risks were top of mind. The 

biggest risks they reported that their organizations 

face include cyberattacks, AI, talent management, 

third-party and supply chain management, and 

data security (Exhibit 4). While this proves that 

companies are aware and considering the risks they 

face, it also raises a couple of questions: Do they

AI, which rely heavily on third-party services for 

such critical components as computing, data 

usage, model bias, model usage, and security. 

  As financial-services companies rely more 

and more on third-party services, they must 

enhance their own security capabilities to avoid 

exceeding their risk appetites and making their 

environments vulnerable to risks.

being an important factor for investment into 

cybersecurity, a significant portion of the survey 

respondents (41 percent) called their metrics 

and reporting capabilities a core weakness.

3  Given the large number of sub-capability options, we focused our analysis on the top ten capabilities that received the largest 
number of respondent selections. We acknowledge that every cybersecurity organization is different, has varying remits and 
scope, and delivers different services depending on how the cybersecurity organization is defined for that company. While 
the capabilities and sub-capabilities in the model may change and evolve over time, we used this framework as a point-in-
time standard to analyze the population of respondents in a consistent manner.

The cyber clock is ticking: Derisking emerging technologies in financial services How are companies 
prioritizing and investing 
in cybersecurity?

FINANCIAL-SERVICES 
ORGANIZATIONS’ 
CYBERSECURITY 
CAPABILITIES ARE 
STRUGGLING TO KEEP 
UP WITH THE R APID 
PACE OF ADOPTION. 

To better understand how companies 

are approaching cybersecurity, we asked 

three important questions: What is causing 

organizations to mature their cybersecurity 

capabilities? How are they prioritizing spending  

on cybersecurity? Do they have the right talent  

to address their capabilities and gaps? (See  

sidebar “Cloud and edge computing—investments 

planned in tech but not security.”)

Compliance advances 
cybersecurity maturity

As to what causes financial institutions to mature 

their cybersecurity capabilities, our survey found 

that there were two common factors across 

financial-services organizations: increased 

compliance with regulations and increased 

defense against outside threats. Seventy percent 

of companies said that increased compliance with 

regulations causes their organizations to mature 

their cybersecurity capabilities (Exhibit 7).

The desire for increased protection against 

security breaches comes as no surprise; it is the 

secondary top factor for maturity. Similarly, given 

increasing regulation of financial services, it is 

understandable that increased compliance with 

regulations would drive capability maturity, likely 

in areas with known gaps. 

Companies should approach compliance as 

the minimum baseline of expectations rather 

than the aspirational goal. Likewise, regulatory 

compliance should be baked in proactively rather 

than a reaction or an afterthought, especially as 

rule makers delve into emerging technologies. 

For many technologies, regulations are still under 

development (most notably in the AI space). As 

regulations catch up with the level of adoption 

across organizations, companies need to be 

prepared to comply. By using compliance as an 

essential aspect of adoption, organizations can 

future-proof their technologies by getting ahead of 

emerging regulations before their implementation.

Spending habits: Companies recognize 
critical underinvestment in cybersecurity

Acknowledgment of underspending in capabilities 

has grown in the last three years. Seventy 

percent of the survey respondents believe they 

are underspending and should spend more. Not 

one organization reported overspending. This 

marks a shift from prior surveys: in the 2020 

IIF and McKinsey Cyber Resilience Survey, 

only 58 percent of respondents acknowledged 

underspending. In 2023, a majority of companies

13 percent of their overall IT budget, on average,

protection of their environments.

to mitigate risks associated with emerging 

technologies and that they must implement 

special initiatives and controls to secure their 

environments. But with the ever-increasing need 

for additional funding, special initiatives will only 

add to existing budget strains.

More than 40 percent of the survey respondents 

have launched special initiatives to address the

emerging technologies (Exhibit 10). Fewer than 

10 percent lack plans to invest in protecting the 

top four technologies.

Financial-services companies may encounter 

obstacles in finding and retaining the right talent 

to handle their particular security risks, as talent 

attraction and retention is an ever-growing 

concern for cybersecurity more broadly. They 

should consider other options, including the use 

of technology to augment talent—making gen AI a 

copilot in security operations, for example. 

Companies rely on talent to address  
capability gaps

Efforts to close security capability gaps typically 

revolve around recruiting new talent and upskilling 

existing talent. All respondents reported relying 

on existing talent, as well as new talent, to 

secure their technologies. However, 65 percent 

noted concerns about gaining and retaining 

appropriately skilled cybersecurity talent. While 

companies can outsource some cybersecurity 

work, more than half of the respondents plan to 

rely on internal resources to close the capability 

gaps related to their emerging technologies 

(Exhibit 11).

Future-proof the 
environment

THE TECHNOLOGY 
LANDSCAPE IN THE 
FINANCIAL-SERVICES 
INDUSTRY WILL EVOLVE 
R APIDLY OVER THE 
NEXT THREE TO FIVE 
YEARS, ACCOMPANIED 
BY MOUNTING RISKS. 

Technologies that are popular today may change 

tomorrow, and as use cases develop and mature, 

companies are likely to continually reassess their 

applicability and investment priorities. The time 

for action to future-proof the environment is now. 

Our survey found that even leading institutions 

are falling short and that smaller companies with 

significantly less budget or ability to attract top 

security talent face even greater challenges. 

Financial institutions should lay the foundation  

for action by asking themselves the following  

four questions about their pursuit of  

emerging technologies:

—  Do we have the right technology priorities, and 

are they aligned with our security capabilities? 

Expansion into newer technologies, such as 

—  Do we have the right metrics and reporting? 

Whether to satisfy regulators or to hold teams 

accountable, financial-services companies 

need transparent, value-based metrics for 

managing cyber risks. They can aid in monitoring 

performance, informing decisions, and 

identifying emerging issues for quick action. 

These metrics should measure cyber risk from 

an emerging-technology perspective and be 

reported appropriately to the right stakeholders, 

including board members and executives, lines 

of defense, and the risk management team.

—  Are we investing in the right things? Decisions 

on technology investments should take security 

capabilities, especially IAM capabilities, into 

account. The growing risk of security breaches 

and the looming need for regulatory compliance 

shine a spotlight on these capabilities. 

—  Do we have the right talent and technology 

to close capability gaps? Every organization 

needs to invest in talent, but hiring and retaining 

the right talent is a challenge and calls for 

exploring other ways to fill the talent gap, such 

as utilizing emerging technologies themselves, 

including AI.
