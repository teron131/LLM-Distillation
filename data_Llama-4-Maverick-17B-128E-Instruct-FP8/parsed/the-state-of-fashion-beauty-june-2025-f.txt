The State of Fashion: Beauty In the US, the beauty market is still an attractive 
play, given its size and strong market fundamentals. 
But political and economic volatility clouds forecasts.
In markets like the Middle East and Latin America, 
where wealth is growing, there are opportunities for 
global brands — but they will face strong competition
from local players. Further east, we expect the 
Chinese beauty market to rebound in the mid term, 
though growth is unlikely to reach pre-pandemic 
rates. Europe will grow in line with global trends, 
but economic challenges may dampen volume growth.

Consumers turn up the pressure

Purchase considerations are also evolving. 
Prominent, public-facing beauty founders were a 
marketing accelerator for many upstart brands, 
helping to push them to greater heights. Today, 
public-facing founders are among the lowest 
consumer consideration factors. While famous 
founders can still build brand awareness, a brand’s 
staying power depends on much more. Beauty 
labels that previously hinged their ethos on specific 
demographic identities or wholly emphasised 
sustainability may no longer find success with these 
branding strategies. Instead, shoppers are focused on 
product efficacy and a shared aesthetic point of view.

The world is changing and so are beauty consumers’ 
preferences. Shifting demographics have splintered 
traditional customer profiles. Yesterday’s segments 
defined purely by demographic differences no 
longer hold, and attitudinal consumer insights and 
hyper-localisation are needed to win. 

Then, there is the question of value. Strong uptake 
in beauty spend plus higher inflation has pushed 
shoppers to pay closer attention to whether products
perform. Consumers may still consider beauty to be 
an affordable discretionary item, but that doesn’t 
mean the industry should take the “lipstick effect” 
for granted. Products in all categories and across all 
price tiers must demonstrate their prices are justified:
83 percent of consumers surveyed feel haircare is 
affordable, but that figure drops to 67 percent for 
fragrances. To cut through the noise, beauty labels 
will need to increase their investments in R&D, 
emphasise their unique value drivers in marketing 
campaigns, and create entry-level price points for 
aspirational and the most discerning beauty shoppers. 

Commercial functions are due a refresh

Two of the most important commercial functions 
for beauty companies — marketing and retail — are 
undergoing a reckoning of their own. An overreliance 
on paid marketing has saturated digital channels 
while influencers’ sway is also waning. Brand 
marketing can help rebalance the scales, but only if 
beauty players have an ownable, original story to tell. 

Consumers still prefer brick-and-mortar stores for 
discovery and purchase, but e-commerce, and 
specifically marketplaces, have become a go-to 
destination for shopping and replenishment, thanks 
to widespread discounting and the convenience of 
ultra-fast shipping. For both brands and retailers, 
some of these practices may dilute brand 
positioning or margins. Instead of trying to solely 
compete on speed or promotions, beauty executives 
should focus on creating a compelling shopping 
experience that addresses the needs of their target 
customers. Technology-driven tools such as AI-led 

7

agentic commerce can also yield gains, augmenting 
the online shopping experience by autonomously 
carrying out tasks for customers and even helping 
them to make purchases. 

While only 10 percent of surveyed executives are 
using AI regularly today, 60 percent are in an 
exploratory phase. More robust AI adoption — 
including in research and development, quality 
control, social listening and marketing 
personalisation — could unlock more profitable 
growth. However, when used in any consumer-
facing capacity, caution should be taken so as not to 
erode customer trust.

The beauty industry will maintain its allure for both 
investors and consumers, but the era of more-is-
more consumption has ceded ground to a new focus 
on value, differentiation and individuality. 
Addressing these factors is critical to solving the 
puzzle at hand.

The State of Fashion: Beauty With little room left for price increases, 
executives are targeting volume gains

Price-led growth is not top of mind for many 
leaders. Surveyed beauty executives expect future 
gains to come from volume. Consumers are 
becoming increasingly attuned to the “true value” of 
the products and services they are buying, though 
that doesn’t always mean opting for the least 
expensive products.

Even though beauty players may be tempted to 
raise prices to ease margin pressures in light of 
economic stressors, they do so at their own risk. 
Based on survey results, few of their peers expect to 
do the same, meaning products with elevated 
pricing could stand out for the wrong reasons.

The State of Fashion: Beauty  
Amorepacific: A Conglomerate 
Indicative of the Times

The South Korean beauty corporation has experienced 
outsized growth as it brings its best-selling K-beauty 
products from Laneige, Aestura and Sulwhasoo to the US 
and Europe. As it charts its next chapter, its focus remains 
on globalisation and ongoing innovation, says chief 
executive Sean Kim.

BY PRIYA RAO

2025 marks 80 years of business for South Korean 
company Amorepacific. But the conglomerate’s 
aims to go global only began “in earnest” in 2000, 
says chief executive Sean Kim. As a result, it has 
faced new challenges that international expansion 
often brings. 

Last year was the first year that Amorepacific’s 
North American business outpaced its China 
business (a “meaningful” milestone, as Kim 
describes it). In its first-quarter 2025 earnings 
announced in April, overall revenue increased 17.1 
percent to 1.1 trillion won ($789 million), buoyed by 

strong growth in Western markets and other parts 
of Asia, including Japan.

“We look at the markets, we look at the customers, 
and then each brand, from their perspective, to 
identify any unmet needs that there are,” says Kim.

Amorepacific, owner of 31 brands, including its 
namesake line, Sulwhasoo and Iope, helped bring 
the K-beauty conversation global. Incubated lines 
like Laneige have captivated Millennials and Gen-
Zers thanks to products such as overnight lip masks, 
while the acquisition of Cosrx popularised 
ingredients such as “snail mucin” into Western 
beauty markets. Newer labels that were previously 
exclusive to Korea like Aestura have recently 
landed in Sephora US.

The State of Fashion: Beauty What values have cemented 
Amorepacific versus other companies?
We believe that the customer makes 
the ultimate selection. [That] has led 
us to the growth that we have 
established today, and we’ve always 
placed great value on innovation. 
We’ve always had this pioneering 
spirit where we’ve developed new 
things that didn’t exist before. For 
example, liquid foundation is a great 
product but is very difficult to carry 
around, so we developed the cushion 

foundation, which enables the liquid 
foundation to be in a sponge compact 
form. We’ve also pioneered the 
concept of ‘sleeping’ beauty. Usually, 
people just think of skincare as 
something that you do during the day, 
but we’ve developed products that mean
skincare can take place while you’re 
sleeping. We applied that concept to a 
face product and a lip product, which 
has led to the great popularity of the 
Laneige brand in the United States. In 
the next five years, we’re really going 

to focus on accelerating our growth in 
North America, Europe and Japan, 
which are among the world’s top five 
beauty markets.

What white space do you think your 
brands are filling?
We have a very holistic portfolio from 
luxury brands like Sulwhasoo and 
Tata Harper to masstige like Cosrx, 
which we recently acquired. The 
regional subsidiaries look at the 
market from more of a channel

perspective, and combining these 
perspectives lets us draw conclusions 
about the strengths of our brands 
[and] the areas they can’t cover. 
Initially, we would address white 
spaces by developing new products 
and lines from our existing brands. 
What we cannot cover with our 
existing brands, we engage [through] 
M&A, just as we have done in the past 
few years. For example, derma or 
clinical brands have seen a rise in 
demand globally. We thought of how 
our brands would be able to address 
this: we have Iope, which could cover 
derma at the high end, so we extended 
the products and line so that it’s able 
to. It’s not so much that we’ve 
changed the brand to meet that need, 
but we’ve expanded the brand itself. 
We also needed a derma brand that 
would be able to address the largest 
derma market in the world, which is 
the US. We found a masstige indie 
brand that was doing very well in the 
US, called Cosrx. Last year we 
[became] the majority shareholder.

You mentioned that North America 
had outpaced China for the first time 
last year in terms of sales, and that 
you’ve moved a lot of your brands 
from the East to the West. How are 
you approaching that? 
We’ve traditionally had a phased 
approach in how we are launching

The State of Fashion: Beauty “We found that the way that some 
indie brands do business is very 
different from our approach.”

brands, so we’d launch one brand, and 
then once it becomes successful, then 
we launch the next brand. We’ve 
always set up an overseas subsidiary 
to do business in that specific region, 
but recently, we found that the way 
that some indie brands do business is 
very different from our approach. 
They launch the same product 
simultaneously in multiple markets, 
with multiple retailers and 
distributors at the same time, and 
then they engage with customers on 
TikTok, and do seeding with 
influencers on Instagram. [With] 
Cosrx, we’ve been able to engage in a 
lot of communication with them since 
that acquisition, and we’ve been able 
to learn a lot from the way that they 
work. In key markets like the US, 
Europe and Japan, we [still] would 
need more of a phased approach. For 
markets like the Middle East, or Latin 
America, or Africa, we can learn from 
the indie brands, and collaborate with 
big distributors or retailers without 
having to set up our own subsidiary.

regional growth are you interested in?
Our most important market is North 
America. By far, it’s the largest 
market, but our success in North 
America also has a great influence in 
other English-speaking countries. It 
has a spill-over effect to other 
countries like the UK and Australia, 
and even though we don’t engage in a 
lot of marketing in those regions, the 
demand is very high. Once we enter 
those markets, the demand becomes 
very explosive. In the mid term, Japan 
[is] a very important focus for us. 
They also have similar consumption 
needs [to Korea]. In the [longer] 
term, we also have India [in mind]; 
the market is now just opening up to 
premium beauty, and then there’s also 
the Middle East, which sits between 
many different continents. There’s 
also quite a large segment of wealthy 
customers [there]. Then after that, 
the next wave would be countries like 
Mexico, Latin America, Africa and 
Central America.

The US is facing a great deal of 
uncertainty. What other pockets of 

Tariffs in the US impact Korea as a 
whole. We’re closely monitoring the 
situation, and we’re also preparing

ourselves by simulating various 
scenarios. But it doesn’t just affect us, 
it also affects our competitors globally 
as well. Even US brands source many 
of their products from Korea and 
China, so it affects them, too. It could 
create a little bit of pressure because 
of increasing COGS, but looking at it 
from the competitive landscape, since 
almost all of the players are impacted, 
we feel that it’s a little bit of less 
pressure on us.

The channel and marketing 
ecosystem is very different in 
different markets. What has been 
your approach in deciphering that?
Ten years ago, most of our sales 
[were] through traditional channels, 
like department stores. Sephora was 
there, but it was quite small at that 
time. But we’ve seen major shifts in 
the channel landscape, especially in 
the US. Sephora is very much the 
leading channel in premium skincare, 
and it has really reshaped the beauty 
business — not only does [it] sell 
products, but it’s also a great partner 
in terms of brand building. For a 
company like us, which didn’t really 
have a very strong base in the US, 
partnering with Sephora also was one 
of the key drivers behind the success 
of our business in the US. In the last 
three to four years, we’ve been 
working very closely with Amazon. 

Social media plays an important role 
here as well, as brands or products 
that gain awareness and popularity on 
TikTok then gain traffic on Amazon. 
We also have other channels: for the 
luxury brand Sulwhasoo we need[ed] 
a premium channel that enables 
customer experience and service, so … 
we have a footprint in Nordstrom. 
Also, from March of this year, we’ve 
opened stores in Macy’s, so we have 
two Macy’s stores in California and 
one in New York. We’re also looking 
into expanding through Ulta Beauty 
as well. We’re also looking into offline 
mass channels, like Target and 
Walmart more into the mid term.

How do you feel about the 
competitive environment today and 
what do you think is innovative for 
the customer?
If we look at just Korea alone, 10 
years ago, the number of registered 
cosmetics companies was maybe 
1,000, but last year that figure jumped 
to 30,000. The intensity of the 
competition is now twentyfold what it 
was in the past. But many of the K-
indie brands are sourced from a small 
number of ODM [original design 
manufacturer] companies, so 
sometimes you end up with products 
that are very similar. The beauty 
industry in Korea itself has been able 
to grow because of these dynamics,

but many companies just disappear 
off the radar. But we believe this new 
ecosystem has been able to drive 
innovation in Korea.

What do you think customers
value today? 
If you look at the popular Korean 
indie brands, efficacy is important, 
but if you look at the average price 
point that sells well on Olive Young 
and Amazon, it’s usually around 
between $20 to $25. Customers in 
that segment really seek products 
with new concepts. Product quality is 
a given, but they want [to have] easy 
access. Setting the right price point 

for these types of products is very 
important. Differentiation is also 
important. If you go a little bit higher 
in the price tier, price is important, 
but there also you have higher 
expectations about efficacy, 
performance and claims. If you go 
even higher to the luxury segment, 
there are also expectations about 
brand values: branding, packaging and 
the experience. So, although we’re all 
in the same company, by brand, we 
have separate organisations as we 
seek to meet our customers.

Beyond the Founder

Marketing’s 
Balancing Act

Channels at a 
Crossroads

Shifting macro dynamics, 
wealth patterns and 
migration are reshaping 
shopper profiles across 
both mature and 
emerging markets. To stay 
competitive, companies 
must prepare for disruption 
and anticipate changes 
across generations and 
cultures. Each market will 
have layered nuances — hyper-
localisation is needed to meet 
consumer needs.

Accessibly priced beauty 
brands have proven 
they can challenge 
pricier counterparts on 
efficacy, innovation and 
virality, raising consumer 
expectations across the 
market. As consumers grow 
more selective and cost-
conscious, brands must 
demonstrate a clear and 
ownable value proposition, 
regardless of price.

Over the last decade, 
an avalanche of brands 
with public-facing founders 
emerged. Communities were 
often built around their 
personal aesthetic, lifestyle 
or social presence. But 
while a prominent founder 
can propel growth, their 
appeal alone is insufficient 
for long-term success. With 
many branding niches now 
overcrowded, quality and 
originality will be key.

Brands must rebuild their 
creative marketing muscle 
and take chances in a crowded 
market. As growth marketing 
becomes even more expensive 
thanks to the oversaturation 
of channels, leaders will 
need to strike a smarter 
balance between brand and 
performance marketing. Dare 
to be original — it will pay off.

Everyone wants a piece of 
beauty. Online marketplaces 
continue to gain share, 
putting pressure on speciality 
and mass retailers looking to 
expand their beauty aisles. 
As assortments begin to 
assimilate and channels 
increasingly blur, the bar for 
differentiation will rise — 
especially in physical stores 
where most beauty discovery 
still happens.

01. The Fragmenting Consumer Shifting macro dynamics, wealth patterns and 
migration are reshaping shopper profiles across both mature and emerging 
markets. To stay competitive, companies must prepare for disruption and 
anticipate changes across generations and cultures. Each market will have 
layered nuances — hyper-localisation is needed to meet consumer needs.

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

• Wealth gaps are expected to widen across the globe 

and especially in the US, where the purchasing power of 
low- and high-net worth consumers will likely become 
increasingly divergent.

• Align brand strategy to evolving wealth and migration 
patterns, recognising structural shifts such as the 
increase of Spanish-speaking consumers in the US and 
diasporic communities in the Middle East.

•

In mature markets such as Europe and developed APAC, 
consumers over 50 are set to grow their share of beauty 
spend. Across the globe, Gen-Z and Gen Alpha will age 
into higher spending brackets and are expected to drive 
outsized growth in markets like India.

• Preferences for domestic brands in China, Korea and 
India will put pressure on global players to sharpen 
localisation strategies and improve agility.

• Adapt go-to-market approaches to reflect local 
distinctions, using consumer insights to tailor 
messaging to cultural nuances.

• Understand the target consumer through micro-

segmentation to avoid assumptions of homogeneous 
behaviour, even within a single market.

Wealth disparities are squeezing the mid-price tier and services

• Apart from fragrance, more US consumers say they are spending less on 
beauty across categories in 2025 than in 2023. This is most evident in 
haircare, where more consumers say they spent only up to $35 on beauty in 
the last six months (48 percent in 2025 vs 29 percent in 2023). 

• Whilst many US consumers are cutting back on spending, high-net worth 
shoppers largely continue to splurge, fuelling growth at the top end of the 
market. With growing wealth disparity, mid-tier price points will likely see 
continued pressure as consumers feel the need to tighten their purse strings.

• The use of beauty and spa services in the US has grown — over a third of 

consumers use them in 2025 compared to 22 percent in 2023 — but some 
users have started trading down or extending time between appointments.

Wellness will continue to grow, especially in higher price tiers

•

44 percent of consumers define beauty as taking care of the mind and body 
and over 50 percent of consumers consider skincare products to be a key 
contributor to their wellness routines, akin to physical exercise.

• The use of beauty supplements is expected to grow. 27 percent of US 

consumers regularly take them, and 43 percent are interested in using them. 
There is white space for more approachable products and innovation, such 
as new customisable formats or creatine supplements marketed to women.

A heterogenous consumer base requires multifaceted strategies

• Brands must navigate a constantly changing and vast landscape of 

consumer needs — from differences in skin tone and hair type to cultural 
preferences. Localising product offerings and go-to-market strategies is a 
way to stay ahead. For example, adding Spanish to packaging in the US may 
resonate with the nearly 15 percent of households that speak Spanish.

The Chinese beauty market shows signs of recovery as consumers adapt
• Economic uncertainty lingers, but Chinese beauty shoppers are cautiously 

optimistic. 76 percent of consumers perceive skincare and colour cosmetics 
to be affordable, and 60 percent and 50 percent have increased their 
spending in these categories in the last 12 months, respectively.

• Beauty engagement remains strong — around 50 percent of consumers try 
at least one new brand every three months, compared to around 30 percent 
in Europe. There is also high trust in the efficacy of skincare products.

Young Chinese consumers perceive domestic beauty as market-leading

• Domestic brands account for around half of consumers’ beauty bags. Gen-Z 
favours local labels for their perceived value and effectiveness more than 
older generations. As this cohort’s spending power rises, their preferences 
will increasingly shape the broader market. While foreign brands continue 
to lead in the premium tier, limited middle-class growth means brands must 
find new ways to appeal to value-conscious consumers in the long term — 
and compete with local players that emphasise affordability.

•

In the mid term, foreign brands will likely retain their appeal among 
wealthier consumers, with high-end beauty expected to return to moderate 
growth. One in five consumers say that they recently chose to try a new 
brand because it is a premium or luxury brand. 

Consumers are more open to AI in beauty than other markets

•

83 percent of consumers believe that AI can offer better beauty 
recommendations than people, giving brands a clear opportunity to build 
consumer-facing AI tools, including agentic AI (which operates without 
human oversight). 

• Rising beauty device use and high trust in AI create favourable conditions 

for connected tools that sync with apps to deliver personalised experiences.

European consumers are more focused on price than before

• Across Europe, inflation has outpaced wage growth over the past five years 
(at a 4 percent vs 3 percent compound annual growth rate), peaking at 8 
percent in 2022.1 Today, one in four consumers say beauty is unaffordable 
— rising to one in two for fragrance.

• With price sensitivity expected to persist, cultural norms around what 

beauty should cost also shape purchasing habits. Mass channels such as 
drugstores (e.g. DM) and grocery (e.g. Carrefour) stand to gain, while 
premium speciality and department stores may face headwinds.

• To sustain growth, premium brands in particular should limit exposure to 
unauthorised third-party channels and reframe their value proposition, 
including through product education, gifting and special occasions.

As the consumer base expands, beauty preferences will evolve

• The share of immigrants in Europe increased from 10 percent in 2010 to a 

projected 13 percent in 2024, with variation by country.2

• More consumers with varying skin tones, hair types and perspectives on 
beauty norms mean brands will likely see demand for vaster product 
assortments.

Large, established players may benefit from the slower-moving market

• Europeans adopt new trends more slowly than others — only 30 percent try 
a new brand every three months compared to 40 percent globally. Fewer 
than one in four shoppers aged over 50 try a new product every three 
months, and half do so less than once a year. There is an opportunity to 
strengthen loyalty with consumers via hero franchises and higher-
replenishment products, such as in skincare.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 01. The Fragmenting ConsumerAs consumer wealth in the Middle East rises, 
premium beauty is thriving

Continued growth in wealthy households will power brands in the region

• The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that the number of households 
with annual income over $250k will triple in the UAE and double in KSA 
between 2025 and 2050. Expats are a key growth driver (making up close 
to 90 percent in the UAE today and expected to make up approximately 45 
percent in KSA by 2035, according to GMI).

• High-end beauty is set to grow in the region. More consumers in the UAE 
and KSA say premium prices are justified than other regions. Around 90 
percent consider beauty products affordable, presenting a strong 
opportunity for prestige and luxury brands to expand and build loyalty.

Appetite for beauty is high across products and services

• UAE and KSA consumers are open to new products, with nearly two-thirds 
trying at least one new brand every quarter. In KSA, 25 percent say high-
end positioning motivates them to try something new.

•

Spa treatments and other beauty services are widely used, with three-
quarters of consumers engaging in them. Half of non-users are interested in 
trying them. Higher-end brands have an opportunity to collaborate with 
luxury hotels, spas and clinics to offer branded experiences.

The region may experience a rise of local brands — beyond fragrance

• The region shows lasting loyalty to fragrance houses with strong local roots, 
such as Amouage, Arabian Oud and Kayali. In the medium term, new local 
challengers could emerge across other categories as well, making real-time 
marketing and social listening essential.

• Korean consumers are leading adopters of at-home beauty tools like gua 
sha and LED face masks, with one in three using them and 40 percent of 
non-users expressing interest in them. This indicates a white space for 
topical products that complement at-home treatments or support recovery 
from in-clinic procedures.

Brand competition is intensifying

• Rapid product advancement has made consumers highly discerning amid 
growing choice, prioritising ingredient transparency, efficacy and overall 
experience, as well as product texture and dispensing. Brands must clearly 
communicate what makes their formulas unique, stay ahead of ingredient 
and technology innovation and, where relevant, feature expert validation in 
the marketing of products to strengthen credibility.

•

In Korea, retailers like dollar store Daiso Korea are gaining traction with 
budget-conscious consumers by adding smaller or repackaged versions of 
brands typically sold at higher-end locations like speciality retailer Olive 
Young. 42 percent of consumers report buying beauty in less expensive 
channels over the last 12 months. 

There are signs of beauty oversaturation

• While K-beauty fuels excitement in new brand discovery globally, signs of 
domestic fatigue are emerging. Around half of Japanese and Korean 
consumers prefer sticking to brands they know. This trend may become 
more pronounced as populations age.

In growth markets such as India and Brazil, income growth has encouraged 
consumers to spend more on beauty. As such, consumers are trading up from 
lower- to mid- and upper-levels of mass beauty. Brands can consider adding 
products with marginally higher sticker prices, such as in skincare, featuring 
special ingredients or limited editions.

A growing share of high-net-worth consumers is driving growth in premium 
beauty, with international brands still perceived as having superior 
performance. To grow market share, premium brands can reach a broader 
consumer profile through entry-level products and targeted sampling.

Consumers in both India and Brazil exhibit openness to trying new products 
and brands, with India seeing a flurry of local challengers, such as D’you, 
Minimalist, Asaya and 82°E. These challengers often focus on needs and use 
cases specific to the Indian consumer.

Celebrity power remains unmatched
in India’s beauty market

•

Indian consumers are twice as likely to be influenced by 
celebrities; one in five Indian shoppers aim to smell like their 
favourite celebrity when buying perfumes, compared to an 
average of one in 14 in other regions.

• Brands aiming to scale in the market can benefit from the right 
association. On-brand celebrities can act as a powerful driver 
of trust, aspirational appeal and engagement (30 percent of 
consumers trust these tastemakers the most). 

Digital direct selling can help tap into Brazil’s 
shopping culture

• Direct selling serves as a core channel in Brazil and wider 

Latin America, with brands like Avon and Natura leading in 
the space. As digital adoption accelerates, live commerce has 
the potential to evolve the direct sales model.

• Live commerce represents a sizeable opportunity; 19 percent 
of consumers watched a live show in the last year and 61 
percent of others expressed interest. For international brands,

The State of Fashion: Beauty 01. The Fragmenting ConsumerBeiersdorf: Spotting Opportunities 
Despite Beauty’s Slowdown 

Beiersdorf chief executive Vincent Warnery discusses 
offsetting China and US headwinds through new product 
launches, hero ingredients and expansion into fast-
growing markets. 

BY LIZ FLORA

Instead of fixating on beauty’s slowdown, German-
beauty conglomerate Beiersdorf is keeping its focus 
on steady growth.

and maintained full-year guidance of 4 to 6 percent 
sales growth.

The owner of household brands like Nivea and 
Aquaphor as well as luxury labels like La Prairie and 
Chantecaille is betting big on emerging markets, 
strength in mass labels and hero ingredients to keep 
up momentum at a time when others in beauty may 
be struggling.

Its portfolio of drugstore and dermatological brands 
has offered the company some stability. Beiersdorf 
is certainly not immune to challenges: luxury 
skincare label La Prairie has struggled in part due to 
the slowdown in China; its global sales dropped 17.5 
percent in the first quarter. Still, its mix of premium 
and accessible labels has bolstered its resiliency. 

In April, the group reported first-quarter sales 
growth of 3.6 percent to €2.7 billion ($3 billion) 

Global economic and geopolitical uncertainty is 
among Beiersdorf’s most pressing challenges.

According to chief executive Vincent Warnery, the 
conglomerate was managing US production and 
product storage costs before any tariffs (or would-
be tariffs) go into effect. Meanwhile, other markets, 
including India, are showing strong potential at a 
fortuitous time, given the company’s plans to 
accelerate its global expansion.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 01. The Fragmenting ConsumerMany companies have been facing a 
challenging start to this year, but you 
kept your full-year guidance of 4 to 6 
percent growth. What are the biggest 
headwinds facing beauty right now 
globally, and how is your company 
overcoming them?
We have to get used to the fact that 
the market is going down to a slower 
growth level. We are no longer in the 
double-digit growth we had after 
Covid. In this market, the usual 
headwind is obviously China, because 
we don’t know what will happen 
[there]. We are still all hoping to get a 
recovery. The new headwind [is] we 
are not so sure what will happen in the 
US with all this stop-and-go on tariffs. 
Where we have the really good 
potential is still in emerging markets, 
not only the usual suspects, like Latin 
America and Southeast Asia, but for 
example, India. India is a country 
where we are all investing a lot, 
because there is new distribution 
online. There is also the middle class 
willing to spend money.

For La Prairie, are you focusing 
more on making changes to the 
China strategy or on other regions?
We have been pretty late entering the 
e-commerce ecosystem in China. We 
are super successful, first with Tmall, 
then we entered with JD.com and [have
been active for] one year [on] TikTok. 

We are trying to correct a few 
mistakes. For example, we [were] 
increasing prices at a level which was 
not sustainable. The second element: 
we are trying to make our counters 
more welcoming. We are changing 
the look and feel of our counters. We 
used to be very good at maintaining 
our VVIPs [very important VIPs], but 
[we were] no longer [good at] 
recruiting new consumers. This is 
changing now.

And moving on to the US, has the 
company seen any impact from the 
news of tariffs?
Only 10 percent of the products I’m 
selling to the US are coming from 
Europe, where I would have had a 10 
or 20 percent tax increase, which is 
not really material. We’re not hit by 
that. The issue is more the impact it 
could have on consumer confidence 
and the market dynamics in the US. 
With inflation, we are very afraid that 
people will start to lose jobs and 
everything. Beauty might be one of 
the categories which is less of a 
priority, and then we’ll see a decline. 
We see that already happening in 
some skincare categories. 

Have you taken any actions in 
response to the tariffs yet?
We will not change the supply chain, 
because we are already producing one

will not open a new factory. What we 
have done is some stocking. We had 
three months of stock in the US in 
case something happened. If we have to
react, we will go through price increases.
That’s the only thing we can do.

Even before the tariffs, there has 
been talk of consumers in the US 
and other places feeling pressure on 
the cost of living. Does that have an 
impact on your business strategy?
The beauty of the beauty market is 
that in bad years, we grow 4 percent, 
and in good years, we grow above 6 
percent. We are always growing. This 
is not a category in which you are 
ready to make such a compromise 
that you stop buying products. We 
have a pretty large range, you know, if 
you want to buy a Nivea cream at 2 
euros, you will find it. If you want to 
buy La Prairie for 1,500 euros, you 
will find it. We have an offer which
is adapted to any kind of consumer 
expectations and consumer 
confidence.

Is there more appetite for accessible 
brands right now or luxury beauty?
You clearly could see that derma 
brands were growing at the expense 
of mass-market brands over the last 
three, four, five years in the US. Now 
you see the mass market being more

dynamic. There is a little shift from 
premium to mass, which is not bad for 
us, because we have both — we have 
Nivea; we have Eucerin. But we see 
that people are perhaps less likely to 
put extra money into skincare, and 
this is [why] some mass market 
brands are doing well in the US.

What are the best strategies for 
keeping household names and 
classic brands relevant in a beauty 
industry with so much innovation 
and newness? 
You have to come up with new products.
This is something we have been doing 
extremely intensively [with] Eucerin.

Beiersdorf has been using hero 
ingredients across brands in its 
portfolio. What are the benefits of 
this model, and are there any 
drawbacks?
The obvious drawback is people are 
thinking, ‘Okay, why would I put 
1,500 euros into La Prairie products 
with thiamidol? I could get it for 40 
euros.’ We have to be able to explain 
that, yes, the ingredient is the same, 
but the ingredient is a small part of 

the product; on top of the ingredients, 
you have the specific formula, the 
textures, the positioning of the brand, 
the storytelling.

And as consumers become more 
educated about skincare and 
ingredients, is that making its way 
into the luxury skincare category? 
Yes, absolutely. If you look at luxury 
brands today, if you look at the 
communication, it’s much less fluffy 
marketing. It’s much more claims, 
data, proven efficacy. Consumers are 
saying, ‘Yes, I really need to pay much 
more, but give me a reason for that.’ It 
cannot just be that you are 
[advertising with] a celebrity or that 
you have fluffy advertising. 

Are you interested in branching into 
more categories, or are you staying 
focused mainly on skincare?
I’m interested in categories where I 
can bring added value. If you look at 
Chantecaille, this is mostly in 
foundation, in products which are 
applied to the skin. I have an expertise 
there. If you ask me if I have an 
expertise in mascaras, lipstick, no, I 

don’t. I will only go into these 
categories if there really is an 
impression that as a company, we can 
bring something, and it will be really 
an exception to the rule. We are a 
skincare company. This is where we 
will focus 90 percent of our energy 
and investment.

Absolutely. Chantecaille is a good 
example of what we can do. It took us 
some time to re-engineer the brand, 
but this year, we know we are 
expecting an extremely good year. 
We are pretty optimistic about 
Chantecaille, so we want to buy other 
brands like [it].

And are you looking to acquire more 
brands in the near future?

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

• 63 percent of consumers do not consider premium 
brands to be higher performing than mass brands, 
illustrating a need for high-end players to sharpen 
their presentation of value. 

• The global share of the mass and masstige segments 
within skincare and colour cosmetics has grown by 5 
percentage points and 4 percentage points over the 
past five years, respectively.

• Despite beauty’s reputation for being recession-proof, 

24 percent of consumers have traded down to 
cheaper beauty products in the past 12 months.

• Understand how perceptions of “value for money” 

vary among target customers — for example, absolute 
price, cost per use or impact per dollar. 

• Emphasise unique signifiers of value and consider 

building hero franchises around them. Factors such as 
sensorial appeal and functionality can help justify a 
higher price point.

• Create accessible price points — even for high-end 

offerings — such as entry-level items, mini versions of 
popular products or gift sets.

35

The State of Fashion: Beauty 02. True ValueMass players are gaining ground, with four major 
shifts contributing to their success

Elevated 
product

• Challenger mass brands such as E.l.f. Beauty adopt similar codes to prestige brands like popular 

ingredients, attractive packaging, high performance and scientific claims. This is enabled by access to 
advanced formulations through scaled contract manufacturing and turnkey solution providers.

• The global rise of K-beauty — positioned as high-efficacy skincare, often at accessible price points — 

continues to build consumer trust in mass and masstige offerings.

Increased 
availability

• Non-core beauty retailers — including mass retailers, grocers and discounters — are actively expanding 

their offerings in beauty and broader personal care, mainly in mass.

• Mass brands have embraced e-commerce and fast-growing platforms like Amazon and TikTok Shop.

•

Speciality beauty retailers are adding lower-priced products to serve full beauty routines and attract 
broader audiences.

• Hypermarkets, drugstores and discount retailers such as Target, Rossmann and Action are investing in 

private-label beauty, often giving these lines preferential merchandising in stores.

Broader 
visibility

• Mass brands excel at driving viral trends on platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Xiaohongshu, 

reaching broad audiences.

• Top affordable brands are maximising influencer ecosystems and user-generated content across 

platforms such as YouTube to target new consumers authentically. 

• Lower price points give mass brands flexibility to embrace playful, approachable messaging that 

resonates with consumers.

Increased 
consumer 
attention

• Newer beauty consumers, including Gen-Z and men, favour mass brands for accessible pricing and 

wide availability.

• Nearly half of global consumers enjoy deal-hunting in beauty, benefitting the mass category.

• High inflation has boosted affordable brands as shoppers seek novelty at low price points.

Social virality and innovations 
such as skincare-infused makeup 
or playful textures can give 
prestige brands a boost.

• To increase repeat 

purchases, prestige brands can 
explore smaller — and therefore 
cheaper — formats, more limited

direct loyalty programmes.

• Less high-end brands like Sol de 
Janiero and Bath and Body

popularity, since lower prices 
enable repeat purchases that tie 
into today’s scent layering trend.

opportunities in mass.

A push for affordability is most pronounced in 
skincare and makeup, where mass and masstige 
brands in both categories have been taking market 
share from other price tiers in nearly all markets 
except China over the last five years. 

In early 2025, around a quarter of all global 
consumers said they have traded down to less 
expensive beauty products over the last year. This 
trend is only set to accelerate amid slowing growth 
and a challenging economic environment globally. 

But this signals more than just cost-cutting. Many 
customers are not price-sensitive as much as they 
are value-sensitive — though differentiating on 
value is increasingly difficult in an era of dupes and 
discounting.

Higher-priced brands should think of creative 
strategies that allow them to open the aperture to 
price-sensitive customers, such as mini or travel-
size editions, a lower-priced product such as lip 
balm, hand cream or eau de toilette spray, or 
increasing sampling in their retail network to 
ensure more customers try their products. All the 
while, existing customers should be retained 
through high-touch client care like targeted 
promotions and excellent customer service.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 02. True Value‘Dupes’ are likely here to stay, requiring higher-
priced brands to demonstrate clear value

Amplified by inflation and perceptions of products 
being overpriced, “dupes” (products that either 
directly or indirectly imitate premium items at a 
lower price) will likely continue to appeal to 
consumers. Over 50 percent of surveyed global 
consumers say they are open to buying them — 
rising to nearly 60 percent for colour cosmetics.

To differentiate their position against dupes, 
premium brands must deliver true distinction and 
meaningful innovation, offering high-performance 
products that create stickiness for consumers.

Benefits like longer-wearing effects, science-
backed clinical trials and transparency of 
ingredient quality should be communicated directly 
to shoppers. Sensorial elements also matter to 
consumers, such as a product’s application, texture 
and smell, while elevated packaging can help sell 
items in a self-service environment such as Sephora.

In January 2025, Charlotte Tilbury launched a global brand 

campaign called “Legendary. For A Reason” in response to an 

onslaught of dupes of its popular premium cosmetics, such as 
Hollywood Flawless Filter and Film Star Bronze & Glow.

“I am an artist, I’m a founder, I’m a president, I’m a control freak … 
When I created the Hollywood Flawless Filter, that [kind of] 
product had never existed in the beauty industry … Product is king … 
then you have these different dupes that are trying to pretend that 
they’re the same thing, [they] are duping the consumer.

… We just launched a Legendary campaign, as these products are 
iconic for a reason. They’re number one in every market because 
they perform so much better — sorry, honest truth — than anyone 
else. Sometimes I invent a category; sometimes I reinvent a 
category. Without innovation, you have no industry.”

Beauty is an emotionally driven category. With product performance now a 
baseline expectation — half of global consumers say they conduct extensive 
research before purchasing — value is also judged according to sensory, 
functional and design elements.

Proprietary analysis of online consumer reviews of select hero beauty products 
suggests a link between the product experience (including design, formulation 
texture and scent) and emotional attachment. Higher-priced hero products 
achieved a higher score than the mass products studied, indicating that prestige 
players need to deliver on these dimensions to differentiate. 

Even so, there are cheaper brands that demonstrate a similar level of design 
appeal and emotional connection; customers rate mass brand E.l.f. Beauty’s 
Power Grip Primer highly for its functionality and appealingly sticky texture, 
which the brand emphasises in its marketing, most notably in its 2023 Super 
Bowl campaign. 

The need for design differentiation is highest for premium brands. For 
example, US prestige makeup brand Merit has made design a core element of 
its identity. The brand explains its design process and shares packaging and in-
store gondola blueprints on social media, creating a cohesive brand image.

Even simple elements of functionality are paramount. Pumps that get clogged, 
packaging that shatters or text that rubs off bottles are common pain points 
that can undermine a product. 

Uncertainty around global tariffs may make it more expensive for high-end 
brands to produce state-of-the-art packaging. While shoppers may be reluctant 
to pay more for packaging alone, a higher price tag raises expectations across 
all aspects of the product.

Kiko Milano: A Masterclass 
in Pricing Power

Shoppers at all income levels are searching for value, but 
convincing customers products are worth the investment 
can be challenging. At Kiko Milano, chief executive Simone 
Dominici is finding ways to protect the brand’s more 
accessible pricing while still elevating the positioning. 

BY DANIELA MOROSINI

Across the income spectrum, one thing unites all 
shoppers: everybody likes to feel that they got value 
for money. While macroeconomic shifts will 
increase wealth in concentrated pockets, the next 
five years could also see wealth decline in lower- 
and middle-income households. Wealthy customers 
will have more brands vying for their spend, while 
lower-income customers will want to make every 
penny count. Perceptions of value will become 
deciding factors for shoppers.

Kiko Milano, founded in 1997 in Italy, has long 
walked the tightrope between high quality 

cosmetics and accessible pricing. Since 2022, it has 
begun an elevation strategy, reducing promotions, 
changing its distribution strategy and introducing 
more premium products; as well as its $4.50 lip 
liners, it also offers a $28 serum-primer hybrid and 
a $32 eyeshadow palette. The brand can now also 
be found in premium department stores like El 
Corte Inglés in Spain and Galeries Lafayette in 
France. So far, the strategy is working: sales grew 14 
percent in 2024 to €900 million (approximately $1 
billion), while LVMH-backed investment firm 
L Catterton took a majority stake in the business 
the same year. Chief executive Simone Dominici 

says further premiumisation can help grow the 
brand’s global appeal — and its margins — but that 
maintaining accessible pricing will enable Kiko 
Milano to add new customers across the wealth 
spectrum. Using hero franchises, social listening 
and strategic relationship-building with suppliers 
and customers is key to winning over discerning 
shoppers in the brand’s more than 1,250 stores. 
Through collaborations with tastemakers like the 
model Sara Sampaio and the hairstylist Rossano 
Ferretti, the brand is working hard to establish a 
premium presence, whilst also fending off 
competition from other masstige players.

42

The State of Fashion: Beauty 02. True ValueIs your core customer shopping for 
affordable beauty only?
They mix and match. We define 
ourselves as an entry prestige brand 
now. In our stores, we see Prada bags 
and Louis Vuitton bags. The customer 
might have a lipstick from Chanel that 
they match with their eyeshadow 
from Kiko; the common denominator 
is the quality. Because we want to be 
entry prestige, it doesn’t mean we 
need to have a lower prestige level 
than a true prestige brand. We need 
to have the same quality but more 
democratic price, otherwise, the 
equation doesn’t work.

People sometimes say that 
affordable beauty is not as good 
quality as prestige. How do you 
challenge that?
When I started here three years ago, 
low price was confused for low 
quality, and 80 percent of our sales 
were done on promotion. When you 
discount your product too much [it 
loses appeal], and that is what some 
drugstores and some chains do; that’s 
why I don’t want to have my product 
in drugstores. Instead, we’re entering 
department stores and speciality 
retailers, among the more important 
ones. We replaced promotions with 
services, and invested heavily in them. 
We offer a 10-minute makeover in 
store for free, and we don’t force you 

to buy. It’s just for pleasure and to 
inspire your confidence. It’s about 
exploring, experimenting, touching 
and playing with our products. When 
you convince people about the quality,
then they become a loyal customer.

The beauty space is being overtaken 
by dupe brands. How do you make a 
strong identity for yourself when 
other brands in your price bracket 
are doing dupes?
There was a season in which 
consumers were loving dupes, but we 
never had a temptation to go for it. 
We’re an innovative brand, and one of 
the reasons why we are strong in 
innovation is because we are sitting 
very close to the producers that 
produce half of the global cosmetics 
used in the world. So our marketing 
and R&D departments engage with 
these companies every day, and so we 
differentiate our innovation with our 
concept, packaging, design and 
quality, and the experience in our 
stores is luxurious and very unique. 
The environment where you buy
the products also creates part of
the positioning. 

What role do hero products play in 
your overall strategy?
When we shifted from being a mass 
brand to becoming more premium, 
we immediately reviewed our

portfolio. To become an iconic brand, 
my belief was we need to have strong 
franchises. The brand needed an 
iconic product that people chase, 
search for and have confidence in. 
Then we created a few iconic 
franchises, one of which is the 3D 
Hydra lip gloss. On one hand, the goal 
is to recruit new customers, but also, 
it’s to create inspiration to create 
different looks. Now we have more 
than 35 shades, so you can create 
different looks, combine with a lip 
liner, and so on. You enter through a 
product, and then you explore the 
assortment and you fall in love with 
the opportunities to create looks. 
That ends up having a higher average 
ticket because you have more pieces 
per unit. Through the iconic franchise, 
you expand your community
footprint, then store exploration, and 
then you expand the portfolio.

What does the rest of your 
premiumisation strategy look like?
Other than creating franchises and 
switching from promotions to 
services, it’s also elevating the pricing. 
This is mainly thanks to product mix, 
so we’ve introduced new products 
with a higher value perception. We 
did this partly through collaborations, 
which we’ve done with Disney, 
Bridgerton, and then celebrities like 
Sara Sampaio and Emma Roberts. 

We had our haircare range designed 
with [hairstylist] Rossano Ferretti. 
We don’t want to become a multi-
brand retailer — these are all still 
Kiko-branded products — but this 
allows us to increase the average 
price. Another way to increase 
average price is by growing in 
categories with a higher average price, 
like skincare.

With those collaborations that retail 
for a little bit more, presumably that’s 
beneficial for your margins as well.
Correct. That’s why our gross margin 
has expanded and then we create 
room to open more stores, and room 
to increase our marketing investment, 
especially on digital and social
media influencers.

In what other ways have you been 
able to make incremental savings 
and boost your margins?
We work very closely with our 
manufacturers, and we have an 
understanding of the formulaic 
products that maximise efficiency. 
Then when we launch a collection,
we buy two million pieces. Our 
operational team, our supply chain, is 
capable of negotiating better pricing 
with our suppliers. It’s like if you are 
in tech and you live in Silicon Valley, 
your network is helping you to be 
more innovative.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 02. True ValueA lot of beauty brands use social 
media virality to get people excited. 
How do you generate that with your 
customers?
Of course, it’s always good to go viral 
and have good user-generated 
content, but we couple [social media] 
with more traditional media like TV 
in countries where it’s relevant to 
build penetration. We have 17.5 
million people within our social media 
network. If you listen to them, you 
start learning a lot. Plus, we have over 
7,500 beauty advisors in our stores. 
These people are connected with the 
customers every day, and most of 
them are real beauty lovers. They can 
give you a lot of insight into a 
community. We have an app that all 
of us share called Kiko Community. 

There’s a lot of pressure to 
continually deliver newness; tell me 
how you handle that.
There’s social listening, and talking to 
suppliers, talking to customers 
through our loyalty program … it’s an 
ecosystem. Our marketing team 
works with suppliers to download 
these ideas into concrete projects that 
can last between 12 and 18 months. 
It’s a medium- to long-term 
innovation process. You start today 
thinking of the concept. What you 
think of today will probably be ready 
by the end of 2026 … the ingredients, 

the formulation, the regulation, the 
compatibility with the packaging, it 
takes time. True innovation doesn’t 
come in a month, unfortunately.

But we see that customers are quite 
fickle, especially in cosmetics. How 
do you create repeat customers?
Even when we are selling through 
department stores or marketplaces 
like Amazon, the majority of our sales 
are DTC so we have a direct 
relationship with our customers. We 
have almost 7 million active loyal 
customers, meaning they buy with us 
more than once in a year. On average, 
they buy with us 1.9 times a year. So in 
the last 12 months, these 7 million 
have bought twice. Our communication
to them is more and more personalised.
The newsletter you receive is not the 
same one that another one receives; 
it’s based on your lifestyle and your 
past behaviours. The more you are 
personalising the approach, the more 
the customers feel heard and the more
they come back. We also have a unified
commerce platform through which 
our inventory, our customer database 
and our transaction data are shared.

In 2025, we see a cooling in beauty 
market growth. How are you feeling 
about the near term?
In the last three years, we doubled the 
percent, which is three times the

Kiko Milano eye products. Kiko Milano.

market average. But still there is a lot 
of room for us because our market 
share is neglectable in some very large 
markets, like the US. This is where L 
Catterton is helping. It won’t be easy, 
but there is room for high-quality 
products in this entry prestige market 
at a democratic price. We signed a 
deal with Reliance, one of the largest 
operators in India, at the beginning of 
the year, and we’re expanding our 
presence in the market. We opened in 
Indonesia in January, which is home 
to 200 million people. We opened in 
Pakistan in 2024, and we’re in Brazil, 
Chile and just opened in Mexico. 
We’re entering Kenya, Ghana, 
Nigeria. In 2025, there will be 2 
billion customers that we have never 
reached before. Our positioning is 
also well placed. On one side, we 

inspire the low middle class when 
they elevate their standard of living, 
and they want to have more refined 
products. At the same time, there will 
be some macroeconomic difficulties. 
When you slow down the middle 
class, they are starting to look at value 
with much more attention.  

What do you think the beauty 
consumer of tomorrow wants?
I think they are more equipped than 
previous generations to spot 
inauthenticity. I think dupes will 
become less popular and there will be 
more demand for authenticity. Value 
will be an important element, because 
the economic conditions might not be 
so relaxed in the future.

03. Beyond the Founder Over the last decade, an avalanche of brands 
with public-facing founders emerged. Communities were often built around their 
personal aesthetic, lifestyle or social presence. But while a prominent founder 
can propel growth, their appeal alone is insufficient for long-term success. With 
many branding niches now overcrowded, quality and originality will be key.

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

• Only 13 percent of consumers cite the brand founder as a 
key reason for buying their most frequently purchased 
brand, but performance and price are cited by 39 
percent and 24 percent, respectively. 

• Brands do not need to cater exclusively to a consumer’s 
demographic for it to feel it is “for them.” Consumers 
across ages, genders and ethnicities say they feel a 
personal connection to a brand if products fulfil their 
needs.

• Marketing and branding that exclusively focuses on 

certain demographics such as race, age or gender does 
not necessarily entice consumers and likely limits the 
pool of shoppers.

• Ensure a strong and differentiated brand voice with 
standalone brand assets that address consumer 
needs.

• Anchor the brand’s identity in a distinctive point of 

view and approach to beauty over targeting a specific 
demographic.

• Leverage a founder’s strengths only where relevant — 

whether to lend credibility, style or reach.

Very few best-selling beauty brands are less than 20 
years old. Only 29 lines out of 206 (14 percent) that 
generated $250 million or more in annual beauty 
retail sales in 2024 were founded in 2005 or after. 
That drops to just 9 percent for brands making over 
$650 million. As for brands with retail sales greater 
than $1 billion, only five were founded in the last 
two decades.

Of these five brands, three are considered founder-
led1 — Fenty Beauty by singer Rihanna, which is 
powered by LVMH-backed incubator Kendo; The 
Ordinary, which was co-founded by Brandon 
Truaxe and Nicola Kilner; and Charlotte Tilbury’s 
namesake label. (A fourth founder-led brand, actor 
and singer Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty, founded in 
2019, has also achieved strong growth with annual 
sales approaching $1 billion.)

While a prominent celebrity and influencer can 
generate early traction, building a billion-dollar 
brand is a full-time and long-term endeavour that 
requires laser-focused dedication. Brands that rely 
too heavily on the visibility of their founders may 
struggle to sustain momentum — especially in a 
market where attention is constantly shifting and 
consumer loyalty must be earned, particularly 
through strong product performance.

A strong underlying value proposition can help 
nurture a brand’s identity beyond the founder’s 
personality over time. For example, in consumer 
social media discussions about Rare Beauty, 
founder Selena Gomez is mentioned just 8 percent 
of the time despite her celebrity status. While 
Gomez appears in some marketing materials and 
attends select press and influencer events, the 
brand has leaned into messaging around mental 
health and sets trends with differentiated products 
that resonate beyond the founder’s personality. 

Implementing a strong operational team that can 
identify where a founder’s authority lies is essential. 
Being stylish or visible in the media can make a 
founder seem aspirational, but that does not always 
translate to credibility in the beauty realm.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 03. Beyond the FounderTo maximise a founder’s potential, brands must 
ensure close fit and a distinct point of view

Fame is undeniably a powerful marketing 
springboard, often bringing immediate awareness, 
potential authority and a built-in audience. But 
beyond the founder, brands must put consumer 
needs first and use creative strategies to deepen 
brand equity.

A founder’s impact is maximised when their 
identity credibly lends itself to the brand. For 
example, a celebrity who is known for dramatic 
makeup looks on the red carpet could seem like a 
natural founder for a bold cosmetics brand, but if 
fans perceive that the founder’s looks are created 
by a makeup artist and the celebrity has a more 
passive role, that could diminish their authority. 
Likewise, an influencer known for talking about 
how to minimise exposure to skin irritants could 
arguably bring a fresh perspective to categories
as disparate as fragrance, skincare and even
bath and body, providing they can also deliver
superior products.

Mao Geping, the brand’s founder, is a 
well-known makeup artist in China.

users achieve more professional-looking 
results. For example, its skincare-primer 
hybrid aims to achieve longer-wearing looks.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 03. Beyond the FounderHaus Labs:
A Star’s Brand is Reborn 

BY LIZ FLORA

If there’s any beauty founder who understands the 
art of transformation, it’s Lady Gaga. 

The Grammy winner’s makeup label, originally 
launched on Amazon in an exclusive partnership in 
2019, did not live up to her high expectations. Gaga, 
whose given name is Stefani Germanotta, and chief 
executive Ben Jones completely overhauled the 
brand with a new name, aesthetic, retail strategy 
and product lineup in 2022. Their gamble paid off.

The reborn Haus Labs by Lady Gaga has been 
growing “substantially” for the past three years, said 
Jones. Its Triclone Skin Tech Medium Coverage 
Foundation has become its hero product and one of 
the best sellers at Sephora, where it shifted its 
distribution after the rebrand.

While not all celebrities create brands they wear or 
promote, Gaga is frequently seen in a full face of 
Haus Labs for her concerts — the “ultimate benchmark”
of the products’ performance, says Jones in an 
interview with The Business of Fashion.

Since Haus Labs was founded, we’ve seen so many 
new celebrity brands. How do you stand out?
We tried to build this always as a brand that could 
stand alone, and Stefani always thought of herself as 
the cherry on top, but I don’t think she sees herself 
as the face of the brand. She is more of the mind of 
the brand, who happens to also be a face of the brand.
For us, we’ve really spent a lot of our focus on 
building great product. Gaga will go on tour, she will 
do movies, she will do many things, and we don’t see 
a dip in our sales when she’s doing other projects. If 
anything, all her other projects raise the tides for us.

What specific areas of the brand is she most 
involved in?
It’s very much on the creative aspects of the brand 
— the look, the feel and where we want to go 
aesthetically on the product side of things. She’s got 
an incredible mind for product, and she definitely 
can see where the market’s going ahead of time.

How do you centre the conversation around 
products when you have such a famous founder?
[Stefani’s] spark goes off when you’re talking about 
product and innovation. There’s always got to be a 
reason for being. For us, it was like, ‘Okay, our reason

51

for being is going to be product, and we’re going to 
build world-class product that wins over time.’ 
Where we’ve been winning is probably a surprise to 
folks, because we’re winning in complexion. We’re 
not winning in trend. We’re winning in places like 
concealer and foundation, where brands traditionally 
at our size haven’t really even played or won. 

It’s been three years since the rebrand and shift 
from Amazon to Sephora. What are the results 
you’ve seen from that change?
Since the day we launched at Sephora, it was a total 
change in our trajectory. Of the 50 people we had 
when we launched version one, there were probably 
45 new people when we launched version two. It 
was a page one rewrite. Stefani, myself and some of 
the other people having seen the good, the bad, the 
ugly on how to do things, we just came in with clear 
eyes and a better idea of how to execute, and really 
built the company the second time around that we 
should have built the first time around.

Consumers value brands that offer something that 
works for them, but there is no clear prioritisation 
of brands exclusively focused on a specific 
demographic. More than double as many people 
feel like a brand is “for them” if it offers products 
that credibly meet their needs even if part of a 
broader assortment, than brands that focus 
exclusively on their ethnicity and gender. This 
pattern remains similar across ethnicities.

Some challenger brands have gained traction by 
specifically targeting groups considered 
underrepresented. This branding approach will 
likely see less success in the future, as it restricts
the total addressable market (meanwhile, larger-
scale brands have diversified their offerings across 
skin tones).

Globally, it is most important for brands to resonate 
with consumers around a shared beauty philosophy, 
whereby the brand shares the consumer’s definition 
of beauty. 

This does not mean that brands should not 
celebrate their differences: instead, focus first on 
product excellence and appropriate pricing and 
then build a brand universe with a distinct 
philosophy and attitude.

Shoppers are most interested in a product’s overall 
quality, results and how pleasurable it is to use. 
Price, affordability and aspirational qualities are 
more motivational than a founder being someone 
shoppers are familiar with or admire. Demographic 
similarities between a founder and shoppers matter 
least to consumers surveyed.

This upends what is often thought of as best 
practice for modern founder-led brands, many of 
whom target first through the demographics of the 
founder. Instead, consumers are more open to being 
introduced to products that meet their needs and fit 
their budgets, rather than a brand being designed in 
their own image. Instead, a shared beauty 
philosophy can help a brand resonate emotionally.

There are global differences — India exhibits a 
spike in celebrity founder influence (5 percentage 
points above the global average, especially in colour 
cosmetics). Meanwhile, India, the UAE and KSA 
have a marked preference for skincare brands 
founded by doctors (7 percentage points above the 
global average).

Deciem: Building Brands 
Bigger Than Their Founders

The Ordinary, Deciem’s flagship brand, shook up the market with 
its ingredient-first approach to affordable skincare, leading Estée 
Lauder Companies to acquire the company in 2021. Co-founder 
Nicola Kilner discusses how it went from disruptor to industry 
giant, and how Deciem uses values to drive decision making.

BY DIANA PEARL

When Deciem launched in 2013, it was the ultimate 
beauty disruptor. The company’s flagship brand, 
The Ordinary, changed the skincare game by offering
a science-backed approach to skincare at an ultra-
affordable price, selling serums with ingredients like 
niacinamide and hyaluronic acid for under $10 a 
bottle. What’s more, the brand made radical 
transparency a core tenet of its branding with high-
profile campaigns.

That value proposition quickly made The Ordinary 
a household name. In 2017, Estée Lauder 
Companies first invested in Deciem and completed 

its acquisition of the company in 2024. Today, 
however, Deciem is a very different company, 
operating in a much-changed industry. Co-founder 
Brandon Truaxe, the brand’s most public face, died 
in 2019, and The Ordinary’s differentiating factor — 
ingredient transparency at an affordable price — is 
now an industry standard. Plus, there are countless 
upstarts nipping at its heels, something the 
company has begun to tackle by reviving or 
relaunching some of its sister brands, like the high-
tech prestige skincare line Niod, the body care 
range Loopha and the cult fragrance brand Avestan.
Even amid those changes, Deciem has stayed true 

to its ethos, according to co-founder Nicola Kilner, 
who stepped down as chief executive late last year 
to focus on the storytelling and people side of the 
business. In many ways, she says, the values it began 
with are more relevant than ever.

According to Kilner, while a founder can embody a 
brand’s values, if those values are truly woven into a 
brand’s DNA, across everything from packaging to 
product and purpose, those values can allow the 
brand to grow bigger than the founder.

54

The State of Fashion: Beauty 03. Beyond the FounderThe Ordinary has grown from being 
a founder-led, groundbreaking start-
up, to being owned by one of the 
biggest beauty conglomerates in the 
world. What has that evolution 
looked like from your perspective? 
It’s changed a lot, but I never feel like 
the changes are because we’re part of 
ELC [Estée Lauder Companies], it’s 
because of the size of the business 
today. At any point in business, you 
have amazing things and you have 
headaches. When you’re a start-up, 
you’re worrying about how to pay 
bills. As you get bigger, we have to be 
very considered around making sure 
every market is ready to go at the 
same time. We can’t afford to make
mistakes in the same way. In the early 
days, we would launch and then we 
could change packaging a few months 
later. With The Ordinary, we’re now 
at a place where because we understand
our community and what they expect 
from us, we have to just take a little bit 
more time to get it right.

At the same time, if a trend happens 
on TikTok, we’re jumping on that 
trend; it needs to be live within a day. 
There isn’t time to do a deck, go to 
meetings and get approval. We try to 
put in structure where we need it but 
also stay super nimble in things where 
we need to react quickly. One thing 
that’s consistent is the values, 

particularly when it comes to 
creativity, authenticity and 
transparency. There are some things 
that we will never compromise on. 

When The Ordinary launched, it was 
groundbreaking to be offering these 
products at an affordable price point 
and also to be so transparent around 
ingredients. Now you have a consumer
who’s so much more educated on 
skincare, and there’s just so many 
more brands out there. How has the 
market changed for you and what 
have been the advantages of that?
In the last decade, the amount of
indie brands out there now is just 
phenomenal, and I love it. It keeps it 
interesting. You don’t need big 
marketing budgets now to find your 
niche and break through. It’s a really 
good thing because for a while, the big 
conglomerates almost had it easy 
because there weren’t enough
viable challengers. 

The biggest change we’ve seen in the 
last decade is a shift of where the 
power sits, because it’s gone from 
brands to actually the consumers 
holding the power. When I think 
about my mum, she would look in a 
glossy magazine and see a Julia 
Roberts ad, but had limited resources 
to actually teach herself about 
ingredients and get peer reviews

The State of Fashion: Beauty 03. Beyond the Founder 
beyond word of mouth. Now, most of 
us have already decided what we are 
going to purchase before we go into a 
shop. Your ingredients, your story, 
this really matters and consumers will 
call you out. If you’re bullshitting them,
they have the power to cancel you.

In beauty, there’s this culture of the 
founder-led brand and the cult of 
personality. How did you evolve the 
brand after Brandon passed away 
and you couldn’t rely on that in the 
same way anymore?
We had a founder who was very 

impactful on our team, and I actually
think that’s what has allowed us to 
continue because he was a teacher. 
When he was creating Deciem, 
Brandon brought in so many of us that 
didn’t have that much experience. We 
were all just in our early twenties, 
maybe had one job so far, we all came 
with blank slates. We weren’t 
preconditioned to think that you 
should be one thing, and he instilled 
this confidence. I see Deciem as the 
founder of our brands because 
actually Deciem is this core which 
Brandon created [Deciem also 

developed prestige skincare line Niod 
and body brand Loopha]. We all have 
this shared sense of the values and 
authenticity, innovation, trust, these 
things that are so critical to us, [but 
also to the] brands that Deciem will 
create.

There are areas where a public 
founder is important. For example, 
fashion, you follow someone’s style.
I think beauty is always quite 
interesting because beauty is an area 
where I think it takes so many 
different experts to make something 

magical, and actually Brandon was 
rare because he truly was an 
incredible designer, an incredible 
formulator, an incredible marketer. 
He actually was incredible at 
everything, but that’s quite rare.

Do you think we’re moving away 
from the founder-led beauty brand? 
Obviously, there are some very 
prominent examples, like celebrities 
Selena Gomez or Hailey Bieber, but

The State of Fashion: Beauty 03. Beyond the Founderfrom it. The challenge with having 
those types of very visible female 
founders is that, in a way, you’re 
limiting your brand. People will think, 
‘Well, I’m much older than them, I’m 
much younger,’ if you don’t feel like 
you fall into that group. We always 
say we don’t think about consumers 
from a gender or age group. We think 
about consumers from mindsets. Do 
they share our values? Are their 
thoughts aligned with us? Whereas I 
feel like when you’re more founder-
led, you’re naturally going to target a 
demographic who associates with that 
person, because actually, the brand 
could be much wider than that. 

How do you think that founders can 
balance wanting to give their brand a 
human connection without being too 
reliant on that one person? 
We’ve always just put the brand first, 
and of course, we all do podcasts, we’ll 
do press, and again, that’s more just to 
tell the story because we’re good at 
telling the story. On our social media, 
2018 was obviously an unusual year 
for us. [After a series of troubling 
messages on social media, The Estée 
Lauder Companies, then a minority 
investor in the company, removed 
Truaxe from the brand in 2018.] But 
outside of that, you would never see 
Brandon, particularly on social media, 
you’d never see myself because the 

brand is more than us. The brand is 
about the community, the values, the 
integrity, everything we stand for, and 
we’ve never really needed to sell it 
based on an individual. 

There’s so much talk about the 
importance of building a community 
as a brand. How have you maintained 
that, even as the brand has grown?
We were lucky in the beginning that I 
feel like the community formed itself. 
On Facebook, there’s The Ordinary 
chat room, which has over 200,000 
members. [That] community is 
independent of us, which I actually 
think is much more organic. The 
reason it started is because we actually 
gave people the tools to talk about 
skincare because, before that, people 
didn’t understand niacinamide or all 
these other ingredients. 

Also, the fact is that we’ve always 
stayed true to our values, even as we’ve 
gone through difficult times. We’ve lost 
our founder, we went through an 
acquisition, but people have always felt 
we maintained our values.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 04. Marketing’s Balancing ActBrand discovery and beauty inspiration still 
happen in physical retail

Physical retail is where discovery most often begins

• Physical stores remain the most popular beauty discovery channel, with 21 
percent of global consumers citing them as the place where they recently 
discovered a new brand — followed by friends and family at 15 percent. 

Top sources of beauty inspiration and brand discovery,
% of global consumers

Sources of inspiration

Sources of brand discovery

• Pop-ups and store locations are increasingly important. For emerging 

brands, allocating more marketing budget for in-person activations should 
be a key consideration.

Physical stores

• Visual displays, promotional activity, sampling and store staff should all be 
treated as marketing levers. Brands such as Summer Fridays align out-of-
home ads with bigger retail moments, targeting billboards near Sephora and 
spotlighting in-store availability.

Social media influences trends — but not always purchases

• Platforms like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube continue to shape beauty 

trends and influence consumer preferences, particularly among Gen-Z and 
Millennial audiences. But social’s role in brand and product discovery is 
diminishing. Surging marketing costs have made paid reach more expensive 
to sustain, further exacerbated by proliferating AI bots that by now make up 
more than half of all web traffic, adding to marketing inefficiency.1 

•

•

Influencers’ sway is also waning on social media. Just 18 percent of global 
consumers consider them the most trusted source of beauty information. 

Social will remain part of the marketing mix — but with declining 
effectiveness for discovery, brands must adapt their strategies, linking social 
media pages and influencers to in-store calls to action.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 04. Marketing’s Balancing ActSocial media success requires a strategy
beyond influencers

Social media can be much more than just an ad 
channel. It can  be also used as a social listening 
tool, creative playground and way to interact with 
target groups. It is a prime space for performance 
and brand marketing, but the latter will take on new 
importance as brands try to assert their identities in 
a crowded market.

Beauty brand discovery via influencers is already 
decreasing. On social feeds, algorithms now 
prioritise posts likely to go viral over posts from 
accounts with lots of followers, impacting 
influencers’ reach. Just 7 percent of consumers in 
2025 say they recently discovered a brand via an 
influencer across Europe, the US and China, down 
from 16 percent in 2023. 

Real user reviews remain the most trusted source
of discovery for 51 percent of surveyed consumers, 
highlighting the value of consumer voices and real 
user-generated content. Beauty experts like 
dermatologists and makeup artists can help to
foster trust. 

Brands should also consider rebuilding their in-
house creative capabilities. Without merely 
imitating what worked for others, brands can create 
the conditions for virality by investing in high-
quality, differentiated and surprising storytelling.

Ultra Violette

Despite being founded by an influencer 
with over one million followers, the 
British cosmetics line has taken a more 
intimate approach to community-
building. It invites creators with smaller 
followings to events, integrates user-
generated content into its social media 
strategy and invited regular shoppers 
rather than influencers on a trip to Mallorca.

The Australian sun care brand has created 
an imaginary ambassador it refers to as 
“Vi,” and uses her persona to create 
whimsical social content. To herald its 
launch in the US through Sephora, “Vi” 
helped bring Aussie snacks like Tim Tam 
cookies to a pop-up in New York City.

Carolina Herrera

To promote a new blush, the brand 
debuted an original three-episode sketch 
comedy series titled “The Blush Lives of 
Sensitive Girls” on social media, inspired 
by a similarly named popular HBO show. 
The high-quality and entertaining 
production distinctly stands out from 
other, more informally created content
on platforms.

The Puig-owned brand engages on TikTok 
by transforming its perfume bottles and 
lipsticks into playful characters in a series 
of videos, tapping into viral trends and 
sounds whilst grounding the content in its 
hero products. References to the New 
York City skyline, for instance, give the 
videos a sense of place and identity.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 04. Marketing’s Balancing ActBrands can lean into the element of surprise and 
experiment with channels to capture attention

Showing up across a variety of marketing channels 
and touchpoints can enable brands to stay close to 
their target groups, unlock new audiences and 
deliver powerful brand marketing campaigns. 
Originality, not copying what worked for others, 
will be key.

Labels that are creative and willing to experiment 
with new and unexpected channels can generate 
significant attention. Thanks to the oversaturation 
of digital channels, traditional media like TV, 
billboards, truck advertising and radio can generate 
strong returns, offer an element of surprise and 
imbue more personality.

entertained viewers while still educating 
them about the L’Oréal Paris product.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 04. Marketing’s Balancing ActCreating consumer segments based on needs, not 
demographics, will be more effective

Many marketers still segment consumers by 
demographics such as age or ethnicity. While useful 
at a surface level, these groupings rarely explain 
how, when or why people actually shop. They often 
obscure real differences in behaviour and mindset, 
limiting strategic impact.

Shifting the focus to attitudinal segmentation 
reveals distinct subgroups and offers a more 
actionable approach. By examining what people 
want and how they make decisions, brands can 
uncover overlooked needs — like a skincare product 
that does not irritate eczema or a fragrance that 
lasts all day. 

To do it well, brands need large volumes of 
regularly refreshed behavioural data. Tracking how 
people interact with content or describe products 
can help shape more accurate personas. AI tools 
can accelerate this process, scanning reviews and 
comments to identify common desires or pain 
points. Jones Road used this tactic when launching 
a lightweight foundation, scraping online feedback 
to uncover priorities like sweat resistance or a 
natural finish. These insights helped the brand 
refine both product design and marketing, making 
the campaign more attuned to real consumer needs.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 04. Marketing’s Balancing ActLuxury brands should elevate offerings with 
higher-touch brand marketing

In ultra luxury, consumers expect a higher level of 
sophistication and integration — the products may 
not be bespoke, but the price point is often the 
beauty equivalent of haute couture. 

There is an even greater impetus to appear 
customisable and unique — around 50 percent of 
consumers are interested in personalised beauty, 
and with luxury beauty brands’ higher margins, they 
are best positioned to deliver on these cost- and 
time-intensive products.

As consumers seek longer, healthier lives, a link to 
longevity can demonstrate exclusive value. While 
currently centred on skincare, longevity has the 
potential to influence haircare and fragrance, for 
example through new technologies that can 
stimulate hair growth.

Luxury brands would do well to consider 
themselves in the broader zeitgeist: their 
consumers are likely interested in design, art, 
wellness and collectable or extraordinary items. 
Extensions to hospitality, such as hotels, clinics, 
spas and membership clubs, should receive special 
attention given the expected average annual growth 
of 10 percent in luxury travel over coming years.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 04. Marketing’s Balancing ActPuig: Creating Marketing 
Excellence

The elevated feel of prestige beauty can seem out of place in
a digital world that rewards instant impact and short-term 
virality. Marc Puig, chairman and chief executive of Spanish 
beauty conglomerate Puig, says finding long-term success 
means thinking outside the box.

BY DANIELA MOROSINI

Today’s beauty marketers face a dilemma. To 
power growth, spreading the message of their 
brands far and wide is vital. Despite all the channels 
available — TikTok, Weibo, Instagram — reaching 
customers has never been harder. Social media can 
be an unfiltered and fractious space, and brands 
cannot always anticipate how their communications 
will be perceived. But Puig, which has 14 prestige 
brands in its portfolio and three licences, has 
managed to turn many of its established names like 
Carolina Herrera and Rabanne into contemporary 
hits through digital channels. It also owns new 
disruptor labels like Byredo, L’Artisan Parfumeur 

and Charlotte Tilbury that have established 
audiences with beauty’s next generation of 
customers. Chairman, chief executive and third-
generation company head Marc Puig led the 
company through its nearly €14 billion IPO in 
2024, and says that in order to propel brands 
forward, it’s more important to take risks than try to 
follow a set path. 

While new competitors constantly jostle for 
customer attention, few become legacy names. A 
marketer’s role today is about honouring brand 
DNA instead of responding to every fleeting trend. 

66

That’s especially true in the emotionally driven 
fragrance category which, along with its fashion 
brands, accounts for 73 percent of the Puig 
business. “People use fragrance either because they 
need self-confidence or because it’s a way for them 
to express who they are,” said Puig.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 04. Marketing’s Balancing ActOne of your biggest recent successes 
is Carolina Herrera Good Girl. The 
fragrance has a very distinct identity, 
separate from the fashion brand.
How do you know when you can 
push marketing even further?
There is this tension between the 
essence of the brand that we have to 
protect because otherwise we’ll lose 
the identity. At the same time, [we] 
need to let the brand have its own life 
and keep evolving. It’s like going on a 
bicycle; if you don’t move, you fall. It’s 
a delicate balance to decide what it is 
that makes the brand work. In this 
case, it’s the sophistication and the 
atmosphere. 

How does that play out?
The typical women’s fragrance is in a 
cylinder [bottle] and male fragrance is 
a square bottle. Look at Good Girl; it’s 
a shoe. When we launched it, people 
said, ‘Does this smell like a foot? How 
are you going to launch a fragrance in 
a shoe?’ Now it’s the number one 
[women’s fragrance] in the world.* 
Look at 1 Million [a Rabanne 
fragrance], it’s a gold ingot. We 
wanted, in the crisis year [it launched 
in 2008], to talk to consumers in a 
way like, ‘Money will give you power.’ 
We take a different approach to 
communication to how we present 
our products at points of sale. We 
make mistakes like every other 

company. Fragrance is not 
predictable. It’s more difficult and you 
don’t know whether something will be 
a big success or not.

What are some of your creative strategies?
Humans are much more impacted by 
sight and sound than by smell. When 
you ask someone to smell a fragrance, 
they will say, ‘Uh, it’s fresh? Vanilla? 
Flowers?’ People don’t have a good 
way to articulate it. If they did, we 
would sell fragrances with the 
ingredients. We don’t. Instead, we sell 
a world around that fragrance, 
normally linked to a woman. And the 
best way is fashion. Most of the top 
fragrance lines are associated with 
fashion. We own many of the brands 
we manage, but most of the other 
fragrance brands [at other 
companies] are licensed. They’re 
licences of big multi-billion-dollar 
businesses, and those licensors also 
don’t want to take risks with the 
beauty business, because they want to 
protect their business. 

So, fashion is your secret weapon here?
To take another example of a brand 
that is not associated with fashion: 
Penhaligon’s. It’s a 150-year-old 
brand. When we took a majority stake 
in 2015, it was just light fragrances for 
middle-aged men. I said, ‘Okay, well, 
it’s British. What can we do with this?’ 

Carolina Herrera Good Girl fragrance. Puig.

67

And we believed there was a 
possibility of making this brand the 
best expression of Britishness with a 
sense of humour. We were inspired by 
Downton Abbey. We released a range 
of scents called Portraits, all 
characters from this imaginary family 
that allow you to tell stories in a way 
that makes fun of yourself a little bit. 
People respond to that.

How do you approach modernisation?
Some of our biggest successes took us 
a long time to develop. People say you 
have to be fast to market. I say, ‘Well, 
we’re not good at that.’ Because we try 
to push the envelope very far, rather 
than do a safe commercial 
proposition, we try to go very far and 
then check whether maybe we’re 
going too far. And that takes time. The 

big successes have been propositions 
that when they were launched, were 
breaking some moulds. In the case of 
Jean Paul Gaultier, we took over this 
[line] in 2016. Le Male and Classique 
were launched in the ‘90s, but we 
have been able to animate the brand 
in a way that has made it into the top 
10 ranking* this past year. These are 
not new launches. These are existing 

brands that we have been able to 
bring up to date and make them 
relevant to young people today. When 
you do that, you create a lot of value.

Shopping for fragrance is often as 
visual; which channels do you see as 
the most important?
We have created a number of tools 
that really helped us interact with

68

The State of Fashion: Beauty 04. Marketing’s Balancing Act“New brands are born all the time, 
but very few pass the test of time.”

consumers through the digital channel.
For example, we have AI-powered 
tools that help people identify their 
preferences in fragrances. Last year, 
26 percent of [Puig] revenues came 
from digital channels, more than we 
had anticipated five years ago. You 
have to create this scenario, this 
theatre, that expresses why this brand 
is different, what’s the different point 
of view. We’re good at telling stories. 
[Marketing is] not just a picture, it’s a 
film and it’s about how you can create 
a film that keeps people engaged and 
that can jump and penetrate into [the] 
world. Another phenomenon we are 
seeing is the teenage boys, through 
TikTok, which is booming. We 
believe that’s a certain phenomenon 
that is here to stay. When people get 
obsessed with fragrance like that, they 
don’t go back. 

Influencer marketing is a space 
always in flux. How big a part will it 
play in your overall strategy? 
You cannot plan a social ‘pick.’ You 
have to create the conditions for that 
to happen. When it happens, make 
sure you’re quick enough to feed it. 
You can’t say, ‘my marketing plan is 
that I’m going to create a social frenzy.’

justify a P&L, so there is a certain 
amount that you dedicate to promote 
your brands, and you try to make those
expenses as efficient as possible, so 
you can do more with them. But we 
will try new things, whether it’s AI in 
digital marketing or whatever.

There will always be new challenger 
brands coming in, especially in 
makeup and fragrance. How do you 
stay ahead of the noise?
New brands are born all the time, but 
very few pass the test of time. When I 
look at the brands we’ve partnered 
with in the last few years, they were in 
the market for up to 20 years before 
we got excited about their proposition. 
It’s very easy to launch a new brand, 
because at the end of the day, it’s not 
that complicated to create products, 
and there’s third parties that can
help you do that. It’s very difficult to 
escalate and to pass the fad of the 
moment. [There] has to be a reason, a 
point of view that is differentiated, and
not all brands have that. I think there 
will continue to be many new brands 
coming up. I think that 99 percent of 
them will not pass the test of time, 
and a few, yes, will escalate and will 
be able to make a dent in the industry.

Marketing spend can feel just ever-
increasing. How do you budget for it?
At the end of the day, we all have to

05. Channels at a Crossroads Everyone wants a piece of beauty. Online 
marketplaces continue to gain share, putting pressure on speciality and mass 
retailers looking to expand their beauty aisles. As assortments begin to 
assimilate and channels increasingly blur, the bar for differentiation will rise — 
especially in physical stores where most beauty discovery still happens.

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

• The share of global beauty sales made online is forecast 
to rise from 26 percent in 2024 to over 30 percent by 
2030. Online marketplaces will continue to play a central 
role in driving this growth. 

• Mass and premium beauty sales on online marketplaces 
are growing, putting pressure on speciality retailers and 
department stores who will no longer be able to rely on 
brand exclusives for differentiation. 

• Newer challengers, like TikTok Shop, will continue to 
reshape the global retail landscape and could cause a 
race to the bottom on price. 

• Double down on a unique shopping proposition, such 
as immersive experiences for speciality retailers or 
on-the-go convenience for mass retailers.

• Drive foot traffic and time-in-store in innovative ways. 
Consider integrating services, expanding the range of 
buzzy brands or redesigning the store layout to 
increase browsability.

• Create a compelling virtual shopping experience by 
including online-exclusive offers and an easy-to-
navigate personalised assortment, while exploring 
automated AI agents.

There are several reasons for beauty e-commerce’s steady ascent, but the 
biggest change agent is Amazon. Its growth as a veritable mass and premium 
beauty retailer is raising the bar across the beauty industry — particularly for 
speciality retailers and department stores. 

Future success in beauty will be less dependent on brand exclusives — a 
historic stronghold for traditional retailers — and instead on convenience and 
the online shopping experience.

Other players outside the US such as Europe’s Zalando, the Czech Republic’s 
Notino and India’s Nykaa are also seeing robust growth and expansion, while 
prestige sellers like Mecca and Space NK continue to grow their store 
footprints. Retailers should understand their consumer funnel and optimise for 
discovery, replenishment and gifting.

Travel retail may also see renewed interest, particularly if tariffs persist. This 
channel can be lucrative for brands that take it seriously — assessing the profile 
and preferences of consumers passing through and investing in a dedicated 
travel retail strategy tailored to each location. Travellers from India, the Middle 
East and China are some of the most likely to buy beauty in duty-free.

Marketplaces can maintain momentum by elevating the experience

• Thanks to convenience and affordability, general marketplaces that sell 

28

more than just beauty have outpaced other online beauty channels. Morgan 
Stanley expects Amazon to overtake Walmart as the largest beauty retailer 
in the US by end of this year.

• Marketplaces have the potential to move beyond replenishment if they 

improve the shopping experience. Platforms like Tmall are doing so through 
customisable digital brand flagships, advanced search features and 
exclusive products and experiences, such as La Mer’s private livestreams.

• Elevating the presentation of high-end beauty online presents retailers with 

another opportunity. Consider Coupang, which launched a dedicated 
premium beauty app with a luxury design, dedicated service centre, fast 
delivery and special packaging.

Special offers, wide choice and free delivery are top drivers

• Consumers currently shop twice as often in omnichannel retailers’ physical 
stores compared to their websites but show greater intent to spend online in 
the future, highlighting clear room for digital growth. There is also 
continued appetite to shop on brands’ websites.

• A sustainable online strategy will need to go beyond competing on price 

alone but will need to be mindful of other platforms’ strategies. On TikTok 
Shop, brands are often sold at large discounts to entice users to shop, with 
TikTok paying the brand the full RRP and taking a margin hit themselves.

73

The State of Fashion: Beauty 05. Channels at a Crossroads 
Social media sales are rising, and emerging 
markets see the most traction

Authentic content can drive results on social platforms

•

•

Social commerce is a core sales channel for 31 percent of beauty 
executives and used by a further 21 percent of executives as a non-core 
channel. The advent of TikTok Shop, which has put down roots throughout 
the US, UK, Europe and Latin America is reshaping virality. It can offer 
otherwise small brands a bigger platform on the app and assist with 
logistics, allowing indie names to quickly reach critical mass.

Retail associates and brand staff can play a powerful role here, creating 
relatable, brand-aligned content that does not feel overproduced. For 
example, Tree Hut’s TikTok Shop performance is fuelled by videos made 
by a small in-house team, whose personalities foster a sense of trust and 
familiarity; UK brand Made by Mitchell hosts hours-long live selling 
sessions with product demonstrations and tutorials. 

Sustainable scaling in live commerce requires a measured strategy

•

•

•

China remains the most developed live commerce market. Over a third of 
beauty e-commerce is expected to take place on platforms like Douyin and 
Kuaishou in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. Other high-potential 
regions include India, Brazil, the UAE and KSA.

Live selling platforms like Douyin can be difficult to build profitable sales 
growth on because of the high cost of gaining traffic. Global brands are also 
often outflanked by domestic players’ agility.

Brands should pay attention to each market’s local preferences. While 
much of today’s livestreaming is led by key opinion leaders, which often 
weighs on brands’ profitability, a paced in-house livestreaming strategy can 
attract Chinese consumers who prefer official brand-originated and 
behind-the-scenes content. Indian consumers prefer celebrity features.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 05. Channels at a CrossroadsSpeciality retailers can double down on playful, 
immersive experiences

Ongoing store innovation cements speciality beauty 
retailers as destinations for discovery and delight. 
Design and layout updates that incorporate 
editorial-style storytelling have helped these 
players stand out. Consumer satisfaction with 
speciality retailers is high — 82 percent of shoppers 
rate their experience positively. 

Retailers are also expanding assortments across 
price points, and 53 percent of consumers now view 
speciality retailers as ideal for both mass and 
premium products. Douglas, for instance, has 
moved beyond its traditional focus on high-end 
beauty to offer a greater variety in line with how 
consumers shop today. Meanwhile, Ulta Beauty has 
pushed its assortment more upmarket. 

Private label brands also prove popular at speciality 
retailers. Mecca has multiple owned lines, while 
Sephora Collection is a consistent top-seller. 
Brands, in turn, should stay attuned to shifting 
merchandising strategies. As stores move away 
from brand-dedicated gondolas and towards 
themed, cross-brand displays, competition for 
standout positioning will intensify.

CREATE A DESTINATION

INVEST IN EVENTS, REAL AND VIRTUAL

Mecca’s new mega flagship, set to open 
in Melbourne in 2025, is slated to be one of the 
largest brick-and-mortar beauty stores globally.

The retailer chose its location carefully and 
designed it as a 360-degree beauty playground, 
featuring a beauty carousel in the centre, an 
“atelier” for makeup, hair and nails, an 
apothecary with a focus on natural products and 
an expansive fragrance section.

Services and technology, such as skin diagnostic 
tools, will play a role in boosting foot traffic. The 
store will also include an aesthetic clinic 
offering dermal treatments such as lasers and 
injectables.

In 2018, Sephora created Sephoria, a beauty 
extravaganza, which now has editions in Paris, 
Milan, New York City, Shanghai, Dubai and Rio 
de Janeiro. Sephora reports events attract up to 
6,000 in-person attendees at some editions and 
tickets often sell out in minutes. 

The events offer playful, immersive, multi-
sensory interaction between shoppers, 
influencers and buzzy brands carried by the 
retailer, including its own private label. 
Founders are often on site to host masterclasses 
or greet attendees.

Virtual formats can build on the excitement. 
Sephora’s digital Sephoria expansion offers 
a gamified exploration and live interaction to 
more than 80,000 registrants.

Retailers like Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and Sainsbury’s have steadily scaled 
their beauty aisles. Curating a dynamic assortment to reflect popular brands in 
regional markets can help drive success. Daiso Korea collaborates with brands 
on smaller formats to offer popular products at lower prices. Meanwhile, multi-
level players like Walmart can further expand their venture beyond mass into 
high-end beauty, but may need to consider more experiential formats to meet 
consumer expectations as price points rise.

For cost-conscious shoppers, robust private label ranges can offer significant 
value. Aldi’s private label line has seen viral traction and double-digit growth, 
according to Kantar. The private label brands from retailers like Costco, Sam’s 
Club, BJ’s Wholesale and Target can also tempt shoppers looking to save. 
Private label brands allow retailers to better leverage consumer data for 
marketing and product development. There is also an inherent perception of 
affordability, which will resonate with shoppers focused on results and price.

62

Mass retailers such as Australia’s Chemist Warehouse are expected to continue 
attracting consumers looking for affordable beauty. As retailers seek to expand 
their brand assortments, they should still ensure strategies are anchored to 
their core value proposition. In 2024, Boots UK launched 55 new brands across 
price points but also added a private label colour range priced 20 to 50 percent 
below alternative products.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 05. Channels at a Crossroads 
Loyalty programmes and disciplined promotions 
can help meet consumer demands sustainably

Globally, 48 percent of beauty consumers say they enjoy looking for a great 
deal, while around 35 percent say they have to shop on discount to afford what 
they want. Attractive promotions therefore rank highly on consumers’ minds 
when shopping for beauty both in-store and online.

While price competition remains high, especially online given the ease of price 
comparisons, reducing discount is a growing priority; 33 percent of beauty 
executives say they want to reduce the amount of discounting they currently do 
online. Beyond impacting margins, blanket promotions can influence longer-
term earnings and devalue both platform and brand image. 

Retailers should experiment with more tailored and targeted promotions, such 
as subscribe-and-save on high-replenishment items, unique codes for select 
brands and consumers, or online and in-store exclusives for different product 
sizes. Multi-buy or gift-with-purchase is especially useful for high-end brands 
that do not want to be seen on discount. Brand executives should also consider 
when their biggest retailer partners offer promotions and decide when direct 
sales should occur on their owned sites.

Loyalty schemes can play a role here, too. Special programmes can help to 
attract consumers in the longer term, even in cases when the unit price is 
slightly lower or delivery is faster at other retailers. Retailers should combine 
their loyalty tactics and pricing strategies for better personalisation. They 
should also understand consumer desires, such as a preference towards early 
sale access, exclusive merchandise, free delivery, birthday giftings or cash 
savings — and communicate these benefits early and often. The process of 
signing up and collecting loyalty data needs to be frictionless; retailers can 
consider making loyalty cards available for smartphone wallets or via an easy-
access widget.

The State of Fashion: Beauty 05. Channels at a CrossroadsWalmart:
Beauty for the People

With its colossal store footprints and diverse customer 
base, vice president of beauty Vinima Shekhar explains 
how the mega retailer is flexing its logistic muscle and 
building a more premium product assortment to reclaim 
its US beauty market share. 

BY BRENNAN KILBANE

When asked to imagine a premium beauty retail 
destination, one does not immediately think of 
Walmart, the US-based chain of superstores that 
operates over 10,000 locations worldwide. Vinima 
Shekhar, the company’s recently appointed vice 
president of beauty, asks: ‘Why not?’ Walmart’s 
recent efforts to stay ahead of the competition have 
resulted in newer initiatives like Walmart 
Marketplace (an “endless aisle” online) and three-
hour delivery. 

Since being appointed to the beauty department in 
July 2024, Shekhar has been hard at work 

expanding Walmart’s premium business, in the 
hopes of serving their value-seeking customer — 
who has grown more discerning in their cosmetics 
and personal care purchases — and capturing new 
ones who might otherwise head to Sephora or 
browse online. Walmart was once the undisputed 
number one beauty retailer in the US, but has ceded 
significant market share to competitors like 
Amazon, which has successfully convinced 
premium brands to open digital storefronts.  
Walmart has also ramped up its online marketplace, 
which has increased the number of brands available 
and helped boost discovery and experimentation, 

creating a digital environment that draws shoppers 
in and retains them with quick shipping, a seamless 
checkout and the ability to stock up on other goods 
they might also need at the same time.

Shekhar’s approach is a comprehensive one and 
includes stocking stores with exclusive brands and 
collaborations, and making the most of its logistic 
muscle and broad distribution. She hopes to show 
the industry how channels can evolve with their 
customer base.  

78

The State of Fashion: Beauty 05. Channels at a CrossroadsWho is the Walmart beauty 
customer today, and how will they 
evolve over the coming years? 
The Walmart beauty customer 
reflects America. What I mean by that 
is, we’ve got every demographic 
represented in our customer cohort. 
There are over 145 million customers 
coming to Walmart, whether that’s in 
store or online every week, but 71 
percent of our beauty shoppers are 
women. Of our customers that are 
below the age of 40, 66 percent of 
them are shopping beauty at Walmart,
and we know that these customers are 
continuing to grow and spend on beauty.
Seventy-one percent [of beauty] 
customers are making $100,000 or more.
These customer [groups] that are under
40 and are [earning] over $100,000

are actually our fastest-growing 
cohorts. Our assortment is resonating 
with these high-growth customers.

Do you think the relationship 
between channel and product
is changing?
A hundred percent. The customer is 
more sophisticated and more 
knowledgeable, and at the end of the 
day — I say this all the time — no 
matter how rich you are, everyone 
wants to save money and time. That’s 
what positions Walmart really well, 
and that’s what you’re seeing reflected 
in our strategy.

Our most competitive advantage is we 
can serve the beauty customer in 
more ways and through more 

channels than anyone else. If you 
think of our omnichannel model, we 
offer the convenience of in-store 
shopping that fuels discovery. You 
want to touch, you want to see, you 
want to feel, and so we have that 
across 4,600 stores [in the US]. We 
also know that the customer wants to 
shop online, so we’ve got our 
Walmart.com, whether it’s desktop or 
app, and through that, they can pick it 
up. On the way home from work, I can 
just drive by a Walmart, pick up my 
groceries, and oh, by the way, let me 
add in my skincare products. I can get 
them shipped to [my] home or have 
express delivery. We now are able to 
offer a wide variety of assortment in 
under three hours. That is extremely 
convenient when you think about

a customer who is shopping for 
specific occasions.

Recently, the morning of an event, I 
realised I ran out of hairspray. I went 
to Walmart.com, I added in the 
hairspray that I wanted, and I chose 
three hours, and I said, ‘You know 
what, we’re kind of running low on 
milk, and we also need some oranges.’ 
I added those to the basket, clicked 
‘three hours,’ and went about doing 
my errands, got home, and my 
hairspray, milk and oranges were
at my doorstep.

How does Walmart blend in-store 
and digital experiences?
We don’t want 4,600 stores to reflect
the same assortment. Sun care is an

79

The State of Fashion: Beauty 05. Channels at a Crossroadsexample. We know that we have 
stores in the South that will carry 
more sun care products than probably 
some stores that are in Vermont. The 
space allocation that we provide for 
categories, the price points, all are 
reflected in how we show up based on 
our clustering strategy. 

Walmart is not trying to be a 
speciality beauty retailer where there 
are 10 beauty advisors in an aisle. 
How that experience comes to life is 
through very clear navigation based 
on need states. When you come into
Walmart beauty, we’ve made it easy 
to know where the skincare aisle is. 
And within that section, there’s a 
destination for acne, a destination for 
face wash. It’s based on a decision 
tree, the customer tells us they want 
to shop by brand, and even within 
brand, product type, so you can tell 
where the mascaras are, you can tell 
where the eyeshadows are. What we 
also know is that end caps [prime 
display locations at either end of an 
aisle] are a great way to highlight 
innovation, newness and trend, so 
we’ve strategically used those end 
caps and those displays to just get 
customers excited to find something 
new, and be like, ‘Oh, I didn’t know 
Walmart had this.’ We also have a 
‘Store of the Future’ in about a 
hundred stores where we’ve 

positioned beauty actually adjacent to
fashion at the front of the store.
As far as online, we’ve continued to 
elevate our digital experience with 
incredible brand shops and elevated 
visuals. We know beauty is a lot about 
storytelling, and the customer wants 
to be inspired, they want to feel 
trusted, and they want to feel excited. 

How will the Walmart Marketplace 
continue to evolve?
In stores, we’ve got limited space, and 
so we’ve leveraged Walmart 
Marketplace for what we call ‘the 
endless aisle,’ which gives our 
customers access to whatever they 
want — maybe it’s that one item that 
doesn’t have the productivity metrics 
to be in stores, but we’ve delighted 
them because they now can find it at 
Walmart. We’re also leveraging 
Marketplace for our premium beauty 
experience that we launched in the 
summer of last year, and that is an 
invitation-only, authorised reseller or 
brand-direct programme. That allows 
us to ensure that we can have 
premium brands in a gated 
experience, so that customers can 
trust that they’re getting the products 
that they love from the brands 
directly or through an authorised 
seller. Since we’ve announced that, 
we’ve actually launched 80-plus 
brands, and premium beauty is the

fastest-growing category in my 
business today.

How does Walmart view social 
selling and interfaces like TikTok 
Shop? Is it an opportunity, or 
competition? 
I would say we’re always looking for 
new opportunities to create ways for 
our customers to interact with us, 
whether that’s in store, at live events, 
or [online]. Earlier this year, we 
joined the Walmart fashion team in a 
pop-up shop in New York City during 
New York Fashion Week. It was a 
beautiful store in SoHo that featured 
the Walmart fashion assortment, as 
well as a beauty bar; it reinforced 
Walmart as a style destination. From 
a digital perspective, we’ve been an 
early pioneer in social and emerging 
commerce — we’ve got our own 
Walmart Creator platform, and in 
2020, we were the first to actually 
create a shoppable livestream on 
TikTok featuring different fashion 
and beauty styles. We also have 
Walmart Discovered on Roblox, 
which is gamified beauty experiences. 
Whether it’s TikTok Shop, whether 
it’s live shopping, whether it’s gaming 
and more, you’ll continue to see that 
because we want to be pioneers.

How will Walmart approach beauty 
collaborations and brand exclusives?

We had a very popular collaboration 
with Sabrina Carpenter. We sold out, 
wished we’d bought more. There’s a 
collaboration we’re working on 
between a skincare brand and a nail 
brand — these are well-known brands, 
but a customer [probably] hadn’t 
thought about [them together]. That’s 
just one way we’re collaborating by 
bringing in unique and different 
assortments. What I’ve shared with 
you [so far touches on] everyday 
essentials and premium, but we also 
know we need to differentiate. 
Collabs and a unique assortment, 
whether it’s our private brands or just 
in-and-out, one-time things will help 
that customer discover something 
new at Walmart.

We’ve got a programme called 
Walmart Start, which is our beauty 
accelerator, and that’s focused on 
onboarding new, smaller DTC brands 
that might struggle with doing 
business right away with a big retailer. 
We feel like we’re pretty easy to deal 
with, but naturally, supplying to 4,600 
stores, the supply chain investment, 
just the item set-ups can be quite long 
and complex. This is our third year, 
and we just announced our third class, 
launching Maison 276, Kativa, which 
are haircare brands, as well as Tocca 
fragrance. What we do is give [them] 
white glove service. We help onboard 

them, we actually give them a path to 
be successful at retail and invest in 
those brands.

Where else does the Walmart beauty 
customer shop for their personal 
care, wellness and beauty needs?
They’re probably shopping at other 
premium beauty, speciality beauty 
retailers or on other digital platforms. 
But they’re probably buying groceries 
with us. So, going back to our 
competitive advantage, as we 
continue to expand our assortment, 

you’ll continue to see that grocery 
customer adding beauty products 
from Walmart into their basket, 
making it a lot easier for them to just 
do their full trip with us.

Oranges, milk and hairspray, right?
You got it.
