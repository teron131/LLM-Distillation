At a glance

 — The energy transition is in its early stages, with about 10 percent of required deployment  
of low-emissions technologies by 2050 achieved in most areas. Optimized over centuries, 
today’s energy system has many advantages, but the production and consumption of energy 
account for more than 85 percent of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Creating a low-
emissions system, even while expanding energy access globally, would require deploying millions 
of new assets. Progress has occurred in some areas, but thus far has largely been in less difficult 
use cases. 

 — Twenty-five interlinked physical challenges would need to be tackled to advance the 

transition. They involve developing and deploying new low-emissions technologies, and entirely 
new supply chains and infrastructure to support them.

 — About half of energy-related CO2 emissions reduction depends on addressing the most 
demanding physical challenges. Examples are managing power systems with a large share 
of variable renewables, addressing range and payload challenges in electric trucks, finding 
alternative heat sources and feedstocks for producing industrial materials, and deploying 
hydrogen and carbon capture in these and other use cases. 

 — The most demanding challenges share three features. First, some use cases lack established 
low-emissions technologies that can deliver the same performance as high-emissions ones. 
Second, the most demanding challenges depend on addressing other difficult ones, calling for a 
systemic approach. Finally, the sheer scale of the deployment required is tough given constraints 
and the lack of a track record. 

 — Understanding these physical challenges can enable CEOs and policy makers to navigate a 
successful transition. They can determine where to play offense to capture viable opportunities 
today, where to anticipate and address bottlenecks, and how best to tackle the most demanding 
challenges through a blend of innovation and system reconfiguration.

Introduction 

The global energy system is huge, complex, and fundamental to modern life. An average person 
consumes energy equivalent to 800 kilograms of crude oil a year.1 In terms of physical labor, that is 
equivalent to 60 people working every day and night nonstop—and double or triple that in the richest 
economies. Access to abundant, cheap, and reliable energy has supported growth and prosperity for 
billions of people. 

For all its benefits, however, the energy system is the source of more than 85 percent of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions.2 It continues to be based mostly on fossil fuels, which account for more 
than 80 percent of all primary energy consumed.3 The world has therefore embarked on an energy 
transition with the goal of reducing emissions and “holding the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels,” according to the 2015 Paris Agreement.4

This energy transition is in its early stages. Thus far, deployment of low-emissions technologies 
is only at about 10 percent of the levels required by 2050 in most areas, and that has been in 
comparatively easy use cases. More demanding challenges are bound to emerge as the world 
confronts more difficult use cases across geographies.

Complicating the task of building a new low-emissions energy system is that it coincides with the 
need for it to continue to grow to expand access to energy for billions of people who still do not have 
it, thereby economically empowering them. This transition also needs to address rising concerns 
about energy affordability and security as well as the role of the energy system in ensuring 
industrial competitiveness.

Moreover, the aspiration is for a rapid energy transition. Today’s energy system has been built and 
optimized over centuries. However, the energy transition is envisaged to take only a few decades, 
typically being associated with reaching net-zero emissions of CO2 by 2050.5

That is a big ask. In the digital age, we have become accustomed to lightning-fast transformations. 
TikTok took nine months and ChatGPT only two months to gain 100 million users.6 But an energy 
system is a physical entity, and historical energy transitions have taken many decades or even 
centuries. For example, the transition that created the current system was lengthy. In the 1800s, 
biomass accounted for 98 percent of energy used; over time, coal, oil, and gas gradually replaced 
it.7 By the mid-2000s, the share of biomass in primary energy dropped below 10 percent.8 After the 
Industrial Revolution, the transition of individual sectors to new forms of energy—from horses to cars 
in mobility and from biomass to gas boilers in buildings—took about 50 years on average.9

Given the multiple goals and ambitious expectations for the current energy transition, it is therefore 
important to understand what it would take. 

Extensive research on the energy transition has been undertaken by McKinsey and many other 
organizations.10 McKinsey has highlighted the importance of addressing other objectives of 
affordability, reliability, and competitiveness on the path to net zero.11 It has also looked at the 
critical, interdependent building blocks that need to come together for an orderly transition, 
including physical building blocks like technology and new supply chains; economic and societal 
adjustments, including significant capital spending; effective governance and institutions, and 
robust commitments.12

This research builds on this vast body of literature, taking a closer look at the physical building blocks 
of the transition—the “hard stuff”—and doing so systematically across sectors while understanding 
their interdependencies. Specifically, it explores the barriers or complexities associated with 
substituting high-performing fossil-fuel-based assets or processes for low-emissions ones, and 
building the supply chains and infrastructure to support them. Metaphorically speaking, only by 
looking at the systems underlying the physical nuts and bolts of the engine of the energy system, and 
how they connect with one another, can a new, high-performance, low-emissions energy system that 
serves the needs of society be conceived. 

The observation has widely been attributed to Albert Einstein that, given an hour to solve a problem, 
he would spend 55 minutes defining the problem and five thinking about solutions.13 It is in that 
spirit that this research takes stock of the physical challenges of the energy transition, building on 
a large body of work on decarbonization pathways. Across seven domains of the energy system, we 
have identified 25 significant physical challenges. They have been classified into three levels that 
indicate both the extent of progress so far and how difficult they are to address. The implications 
for stakeholders, including for innovation and broader system reconfiguration, are explored. The 
first four chapters of this report give an overview of the findings. Chapters 5 to 11 are more detailed 
discussions of each of the seven domains and the challenges within them, and are coauthored with 
McKinsey experts. 

The aspiration of this work is that viewing the energy transition from a physical perspective will 
contribute to a better design for a successful transition and to navigating an affordable, reliable, and 
competitive path to net zero. 

Across seven domains of the  
energy system, we have identified 
25 significant physical challenges.

Executive summary

Today’s energy system, encompassing both the production and consumption of energy resources, 
is massive and complex. The system has been optimized over centuries, is deeply embedded in the 
global economy, and serves billions of people, if not yet all of humanity.14 And it is high-performing. 
Energy can be dispatched relatively easily where and when it is needed because current fuels are 
energy-dense and easily transportable. Supply can be ramped up and down quickly. 

For all its advantages, today’s system also has critical flaws. About two-thirds of energy is currently 
wasted.15 And the system generates more than 85 percent of global emissions of carbon dioxide 
(CO2).16 Companies and countries are now engaged in an effort to transition the energy system and 
reduce those emissions. Real progress has been made, but the transition remains in its early stages. 

Low-emissions technologies such as solar and wind power and electric vehicles (EVs) have 
advantageous properties and can be brought together to deliver high performance. But deploying 
them well and progressing the transition further requires understanding the physical realities and 
associated physical challenges of the energy transition—the “hard stuff.” 

Recognizing that the energy transition is first and foremost a physical transformation is a truth that 
can get lost in the abstraction of net-zero scenarios. But it is vital if the new energy system is to 
retain, or even improve on, the performance of the current one and secure an affordable, reliable, 
competitive path to net zero.17

Seven domains of the energy system would need to be transformed,  
and this effort is in its early stages 
The energy transition involves the physical transformation of seven deeply interlinked domains. 
The first is the power domain, which needs to reduce its own emissions and to scale dramatically to 
provide low-emissions energy to the three large consuming domains: mobility, industry, and buildings. 
The final three domains are enablers of the energy transition: raw materials, especially critical 
minerals; new fuels, such as hydrogen and other energy carriers; and carbon and energy reduction. 

This research primarily uses the 2023 McKinsey Achieved Commitments scenario, not as a 
forecast, but to understand the physical challenges to overcome.18 Under this scenario, billions of 
low-emissions assets—for instance, about one billion EVs, over 1.5 billion heat pumps, and about 
35 terawatts of low-emissions power generation capacity—would need to be deployed by 2050 
alongside scaling supporting infrastructure such as the grid, EV charging stations, and supply chains. 

Recent years have seen momentum on many—but not all—fronts. For instance, about 90 percent 
of all battery EV sales and almost 60 percent of solar and wind power capacity added was in the 
past five years.19 But overall, the transition is in its early stages. Deployment of low-emissions 
technologies is currently only about 10 percent of the levels required by 2050 in most areas—and 
largely in comparatively easy use cases. While some areas like solar have grown rapidly, others have 
not. In cases such as low-emissions hydrogen and carbon capture, less than 1 percent of required 
deployment by 2050 has been achieved thus far. 

Abating about half of energy-related emissions depends on addressing  
the hardest of 25 physical challenges
To progress the transition further, 25 physical challenges—defined as barriers to switching from 
high-emissions physical assets and processes to low-emissions ones—across the seven domains 
would need to be addressed (Exhibit E1).

Some challenges are harder to address than others, and they have been categorized into three levels 
of difficulty based on technological performance, interdependencies across different challenges, and 
scaling needs:

 — Three Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the 

least physical hurdles. 

 — Ten Level 2 challenges require the deployment of known technologies to accelerate, and 

associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. 

 — Twelve Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological performance (often with 
demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning. 

Eliminating between 40 and 60 percent of the energy system’s CO2 emissions depends on 
addressing Level 3 challenges. 

Physical challenges appear in each of the seven domains: A summary

 — Power. Overall, low-emissions power generation capacity would have to increase about ten 

times by 2050. There are two Level 3 challenges: managing variability in the power system as 
solar and wind generate a greater share of power, and doing so in emerging power systems 
that need to grow particularly rapidly. The flexible capacity that would be required to manage 
this variability, including backup generation, storage, and interconnections of grids in different 
regions, would need to grow two to seven times faster than power demand, but all face barriers.20 
Four other Level 2 challenges relate to securing enough land for renewables, investing in 
current transmission and distribution infrastructure and even expanding the grid, accelerating 
deployment of nuclear and other clean firm power, and increasing flexibility in power demand. 

 — Mobility. The number of EVs would need to surge from about 30 million on the road today to 

about one billion by 2050. Two challenges are Level 1: ensuring lifetime emissions savings from 
passenger battery EVs (BEVs) relative to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, and ensuring 
that EVs have sufficient range for all needs.21 For the latter, battery EVs already do so for roughly 
70 percent of households. Scaling EV charging infrastructure and supply chains has further to go 
and is Level 2. Trucking, aviation, and shipping are harder to decarbonize, given that they require 
traveling long distances with heavy payloads, and are Level 3 challenges.

 — Industry. Decarbonization of the “big four” industrial material pillars of modern civilization— 

steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia—poses four Level 3 challenges, where the transformation 
is just beginning. All rely heavily on fossil fuels as inputs and/or fuel for high-temperature heat.22 
A combination of more energy efficiency; different feedstocks, including hydrogen and recycled 
inputs; use of alternative materials; electrification; alternative fuels like biomass; and carbon 
capture would be needed. Other industries, such as general manufacturing, generally do not 
need high-temperature heat and tend not to use fossil fuels as feedstocks, but low-emissions 
processes to deliver heat would still need to be scaled and this constitutes a Level 2 challenge.

 — Buildings. Heating accounts for the largest share of buildings-related emissions. Heat pumps 
are already established technologies and perform well, but still face two physical challenges.23 
Ensuring that they are efficient at cold temperatures is a Level 1 challenge, reflecting the fact that 
more than 95 percent of people live in places where existing heat-pump technologies do the job. 
More demanding, and therefore Level 2, is managing a potential doubling or tripling in peak power 
demand in some regions if heat pump use expands.24

 — Raw materials. Demand for critical minerals, like lithium, cobalt, and rare earths, is expected to 

surge, but current supply is only about 10 to 35 percent of what would be needed by 2050. This is 
a Level 2 challenge, where supply would need to be accelerated, alongside managing demand for 
such minerals.

 — Hydrogen and other energy carriers. New energy carriers would be needed to serve as 

alternative fuels and feedstocks for industrial processes. One option is hydrogen, which faces 
two Level 3 challenges. First, the hydrogen molecule goes through many steps and therefore 
energy losses before it can be used; these would need to be minimized and weighed against its 
advantageous properties. Second, hydrogen production and infrastructure would need to expand 
hugely. Few large-scale low-emissions hydrogen projects are currently operational.25 Managing 
the growing land footprint of biofuels is Level 2.

 — Carbon and energy reduction. Alongside measures to substitute high-emissions technologies 

for low-emissions ones, reducing the amount of energy consumed and the emissions of 
current technologies would also be needed. Expanding energy efficiency through established 
approaches, for example improving building insulation, is a Level 2 challenge. Carbon capture 
from new “point sources” such as cement could be three times harder—and costlier—than for 
less demanding current use cases, and removing carbon from the atmosphere through direct air 
capture could be even more costly. Both are Level 3. 

Understanding the physical challenges can help CEOs and policy makers  
navigate the transition
Making progress on the transition requires understanding physical challenges. Innovation of 
technologies, such as improving the energy density of batteries, would need to continue. Broader 
system-level changes would also be needed—shifting the way technologies mesh together, for 
instance by expanding demand-side flexibility to reduce the variability of the power system. Even the 
way energy and materials are consumed could be adapted. For instance, alternative materials could 
replace industrial materials that are difficult to decarbonize. 

CEOs and policy makers have a crucial role to play. For Level 1 challenges, they could consider how to 
quickly deploy fast-maturing technologies, and, for Level 2 challenges, how to address bottlenecks 
to unlock the next tranche of opportunities. For the difficult Level 3 challenges, they could consider in 
parallel how to make progress in the short term and how to unlock the system-level changes needed. 
As they do this, stakeholders need to consider how to ramp down the old system and ramp up the 
new one smoothly, and what investments could reduce emissions today while laying the groundwork 
for tackling future physical challenges.

1. The energy transition is 
a huge, nascent physical 
transformation 

The energy system consists of the production, conversion, delivery, and consumption of energy 
resources across sectors as both fuels and feedstocks (that is, inputs for the production of different 
materials).26 The system is a massive, interlocking physical entity that has been optimized over 
centuries. It has served billions of people—if not yet all of humanity—well. But in an era in which 
countries and companies around the world are aspiring to address climate change, the high 
emissions resulting from the current energy system are now firmly in focus. The world has duly 
embarked on a huge transformation, centered on switching from the high-emissions assets and 
processes on which the system is largely based to new low-emissions solutions.

The key to success is recognizing that the energy system is physical, made up of millions of assets 
that work together to deliver specific functions, and that the transition is therefore first and foremost 
a physical transformation. The physical nature of the energy transition can get lost in the abstraction 
of net-zero scenarios, but understanding the physical realities and associated physical challenges 
of the transition—the “hard stuff”—is vital if effective solutions are to be designed and an affordable, 
reliable, competitive path to net zero delivered (see Sidebar 1, “Why understanding the physical 
realities of the transition matters”). 

The physical transformation is a shift on a massive scale of high-emissions assets to low-emissions 
ones, such as solar and wind power, electric vehicles (EVs), and myriad others, and doing so in a 
manner that continues to deliver performance. But this is not all—supporting infrastructure and 
supply chains would need to be developed. These would include critical minerals, manufactured 
goods, transmission and distribution infrastructure, and EV charging stations, to name a few. 

Today’s energy system is high-functioning but generates high emissions 
The energy system is huge and complex. The world has well over 60,000 power plants, delivering 
electricity to more than six billion people.27 The length of the global oil and gas pipeline network is 
about two million kilometers, equivalent to traveling from the Earth to the moon and back—twice.28 
The energy system enables the production of about seven billion tonnes (metric tons) of industrial 
materials every year, accounting for about 800 kilograms of steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia for 
every person annually.29 And today, more than 1.5 billion vehicles are on the road, the vast majority of 
them powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) that run on fossil fuels.30

Not only is the energy system extraordinarily large in scale, but it is high-performing. A number of 
crucial properties have enabled today’s energy system to play its central role in society, making 
economic progress possible. It can move energy relatively easily to where it is needed because 
current fuels are both energy-dense and easily transportable. Just one average tanker carrying 
liquefied natural gas can power more than 40,000 homes in the United States for an entire year.31

The energy system can ramp the provision of energy up and down quickly, to dispatch energy to the 
right place at the right time. A gas turbine power plant can move from full shutdown to generating 
power at full capacity in less than ten minutes.32 The current energy system also supports the 
manufacture of thousands of materials thanks to the chemical flexibility of fossil fuels, namely that 
they can be used as feedstocks for multiple materials, and the ability of fossil fuels to generate a 
wide range of temperatures needed for industrial processes. Natural gas alone can be a feedstock 
for a range of materials, such as fertilizers, plastics, and steel, and burns at temperatures close to 
2,000ºC, thereby providing the high-temperature heat needed for many industrial processes.33

Sidebar 1. Why understanding 
the physical realities of the  
transition matters 

Understanding the physical realities of the 
energy transition—namely the physical 
properties of low-emissions solutions and 
the nature of the physical transformation—
is critical to many aspects of designing a 
successful transition. 

First, understanding the physical properties 
of low-emissions solutions can help design  
a new system that delivers performance  
on a par with the current system and  
does so reliably. This matters because 
the energy system is vital for driving 
economic growth and progress. As 
discussed later, this is not a trivial task 
and it requires a careful understanding of 
the performance and advantages of low-
emissions technologies, innovation needs, 
and how such technologies can effectively 
be brought together in an interconnected 
system to deliver performance.

Second, looking at the nature and scale of 
the underlying physical transformation helps 
design a feasible transition. In an energy 
system made up of thousands or millions, 

and in some cases billions, of individual 
assets, the transformation that would be 
needed is monumental. With such a massive 
scale-up, bottlenecks in the build-out of 
supply chains could lead to shortages of 
critical minerals and manufactured goods. 
Installing or building new low-emissions 
assets at the scale and pace needed may be 
similarly difficult if not planned for well. 

Third, and relatedly, applying a physical 
lens to different components of the 
energy system can highlight critical 
interdependencies, which similarly need to 
be factored into the design of a reliable and 
feasible energy transition. 

Fourth, understanding the physical 
properties and maturity of different 
technologies, and the nature of the physical 
transformation, also helps to shed light on 
their costs and therefore on the affordability 
of the transition.1 Prior McKinsey research 
has highlighted the large scale-up needed in 
low-emissions capital spending and various 
challenges associated with the affordability 
of the transition.2 While costs associated 
with the transition are not the core focus 
of this research, appreciating the physical 
realities of the transition is crucial to better 
understand cost challenges. For example, 

in the case of carbon capture technologies, 
expanding their use to new use cases 
would require deploying them in processes 
where CO2 makes up a small portion of the 
gases that are emitted (that is, is present 
in lower concentration in flue gases) and 
is therefore harder to capture. This could 
be about three times more expensive than 
the cost of capture of higher-concentration 
use cases deployed today.3 The massive 
physical scale-up of the assets needed for a 
new system could also lead to shortages of 
raw materials and, as a result, contribute to 
price increases and create volatility. In 2022, 
prices of cobalt, lithium, and nickel surged, 
leading to an increase in the price of batteries 
of nearly 10 percent globally.4 A sharp drop 
in prices quickly followed. This volatility 
generated uncertainty that contributed to the 
postponement of new mining projects.5

Thus, a physical lens brings focus on not 
just how to achieve emissions reduction 
feasibly but also to do so while ensuring 
affordability, maintaining the reliability of 
the energy system, and thus also securing 
the competitiveness of companies and 
economies—three other objectives that 
McKinsey research has identified as vital for 
a successful transition.6

This not to say that every component of the current energy system delivers equally high performance. 
For example, natural gas is much less energy dense than oil. Coal power plants cannot ramp up as 
quickly as natural gas ones. But, in combination, the component fuels and technologies are able to 
meet numerous use cases. 

Moreover, over centuries, sectors that consume energy have coevolved to make the most of the 
properties of fossil fuels to optimize buildings, cars, and industries. For example, flights capable 
of long-range travel have emerged, making the most of the energy density afforded by fossil fuels.

Industrial processes have developed to use the high temperatures generated by the burning of 
coal or gas. And these changes have shaped our broader economic and social lives. Coupled with 
hundreds of years of industrial learning and accumulated investment, this coevolution has delivered 
cheap, reliable, convenient, and resilient ways to produce and consume energy. 

Nevertheless, for all the advantages of the current energy system, it has significant flaws.34 
About two-thirds of energy consumed today is wasted, mostly due to low energy efficiency in the 
conversion and use of fossil fuels.35 But perhaps most notably, today’s energy system leads to high 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Today’s energy system is responsible for more than 85 percent of 
global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).36 To take one instance, more than two kilograms of CO2 
are released for every liter of gasoline burned. An average tree would take about 40 days to absorb 
that volume.37

Overall, then, today’s energy system is a conundrum, offering a mix of positive and negative 
attributes. At the heart of the transition is an aspiration to retain—and even improve on—the 
performance advantages offered by the current energy system while addressing many major 
downsides, especially high emissions. 

This effort is further complicated in two ways. First, as noted, the current aspiration is to achieve 
the energy transition in a short time frame in comparison with transitions of the past.38 Second, the 
energy system of today does not meet the needs of a large share of the world’s people—it still needs 
to grow.39 The average person lives with less than 55 gigajoules of energy each year. That is about 
the level of Thailand but only about half the energy each person in Germany consumes.40 In 2022, 
760 million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, had no access to electricity.41 
Transforming the vast and complex energy system in a short time, even while growing to serve the 
needs of more of the world’s population, would be no mean feat. 

Transforming the energy system would require considering how best to  
deliver performance 
Standards of living across the world would depend on a new energy system being able to deliver the 
same or better performance in comparison with the existing one. 

A superficial glance at today’s energy system might suggest that fossil-fuel-based technologies 
deliver performance superior to that of low-emissions alternatives across the board (Exhibit 1). Today, 
fuels such as diesel have about 50 times higher gravimetric energy density (or per unit weight) than 
the batteries used in electric cars.42 Electricity and many low-emissions energy carriers such as 
hydrogen are harder and more costly to transport over long distances than fossil fuels. Solar and wind 
power output is variable and not dispatchable, unlike gas or coal power plants’ output. 

But a closer look reveals that advantageous physical properties are not universally the purview 
of fossil fuels. Low-emissions technologies can often match or even exceed the performance of 
fossil-fuel-based ones.43 For instance, batteries can provide quicker dispatchability than even 
gas-fired peaking plants.44 Nuclear plants often have higher capacity factors than gas plants. 
Hydrogen has higher gravimetric energy density and burns at higher temperatures than natural 
gas. Electric technologies such as electric cars and heat pumps often have double the efficiency of 
fossil-fuel combustion-based assets, or even more. A new energy system built using low-emissions 
technologies could potentially replicate the properties of the current one and even improve on them, 
depending on how these technologies are deployed and combined.

Low-emissions technologies are also improving as innovation advances. For instance, the capacity 
factors of wind power in the United States have almost doubled in the past 20 years (meaning that 
they generate electricity more consistently), and the energy density of batteries has been growing at 
about 3 percent a year (meaning that the same weight of battery carries more energy).45

Note: This exhibit assesses the current state of critical properties of individual technologies to outline the potential building blocks of a new system. In practice, a 
new system would not consist of one-to-one substitutions, so performance at the system level depends not just on individual technology performance but on how

Furthermore, there is considerable scope to combine individual low-emissions technologies to create 
entirely new configurations to deliver on performance, even if those individual technologies have less 
favorable physical properties than fossil-fuel ones. This is not limited to energy supply but applies 
across sectors that both produce and consume energy. Indeed, just as the current energy system was 
shaped by the co-evolution of energy-producing and -consuming sectors, so too can a new system. 
One such reconfiguration is coupling industrial electrification with thermal energy storage (TES), 
which stores heat and therefore creates a much more flexible demand profile for electricity from 
industry. This can help manage the variable supply from some renewable sources of electricity like 
sunshine and wind. In a nutshell, electrified industrial processes can produce and store some of the 
heat they need in advance during times when such renewable electricity is plentiful and cheap due to 
lots of generation (for example, during the day when the sun is shining). They can draw on that stored 
heat later in order to reduce the demand on the grid at times when generation is lower, thus helping 
manage the fact that many generation technologies that would be part of a new energy system are 
not dispatchable.46 (Other examples of such reconfigurations are discussed in chapter 4).

Put together, this discussion underscores the importance of understanding the physical properties  
of low-emissions technologies and how they can be brought together to ensure a high-functioning 
low-emissions energy system.

Seven interlinked domains of the energy system would need to be  
physically transformed
Seven domains would need to be physically transformed as part of the energy transition. 

The first of these is the power sector, which is at the heart of the transition. It would need to transform 
to reduce its own emissions. In an interlinked energy system, it also needs to scale up dramatically 
to provide low-emissions energy to the three key consuming sectors: mobility (road vehicles and 
other forms of transportation to move people and things); industry (which manufactures a broad 
range of materials and goods like steel and cement); and buildings (facilities that consume energy 
for lighting, heating, and more). The final three domains explored are crucial enablers of the energy 
system transformation: raw materials, with a key focus on the critical minerals needed for many 
low-emissions technologies like batteries and electrolyzers (devices that split water molecules into 
hydrogen and oxygen); new energy carriers, such as hydrogen; and carbon and energy reduction 
approaches that include carbon capture and energy reduction (Exhibit 2).47 Addressing issues in 
other sectors, like agriculture, forestry, and other land use, is of course critical to achieving net-
zero emissions, but the focus of this research is energy supply and demand and therefore does not 
consider these aspects of the transition. 

These seven domains are deeply interlinked. All of the low-emissions physical assets that would 
make up the new energy system are interdependent, making the transition a complex undertaking. 
For example, decarbonizing mobility, buildings, and industry would require a larger, lower-emissions 
power system to feed ever-growing demand for electricity from new technologies ranging from 
EVs to heat pumps. New energy carriers, such as hydrogen, also would need a great deal of power. 
These carriers, in turn, could propel adoption of applications in mobility and in industry, such as 
low-emissions steelmaking. Hydrogen and other low-emissions fuels can also be used as sources 
of backup power for power systems with large shares of variable renewable energy sources. All 
domains would rely on the availability of raw materials, and the power system, mobility, and hydrogen 
applications would be particularly voracious consumers of critical minerals. As such, a modular 
approach to the energy transition would not work. A system view is needed.

Progress has been made, but the transformation is at an early stage,  
and the next phases will be different
While real progress has been made, the energy transition is in its early stages. Although the intensity 
of emissions per unit of primary energy consumed has declined by about 7 percent over the past 
decade, CO2 emissions are still growing globally—albeit at a slowing rate and not everywhere.48  
Fossil fuels still account for about 80 percent of global primary energy demand, only about four 
percentage points lower than 20 years ago (Exhibit 3).49 The world has been electrifying, but slowly. 
Between 2005 and 2022, the share of electricity in total final energy consumption grew by fewer 
than five percentage points, from about 16 percent to 20 percent.50 While sales and deployment of 
low-emissions technologies have been rising, stocks take time to turn over.

1Total energy available from natural sources before any losses occur in the energy conversion process, using substitution method. Primary energy is used here 
because it is a widely available global metric that gives a rough indication of current contributions of different energy sources to the energy system. But there are 
limitations to comparisons of primary energy contributions from fossil fuels and other energy sources, given that most energy contained in fossil fuels is lost in 
conversions. During the energy transition, therefore, not all primary energy supply would need to be replaced one-for-one. 2Variable renewable energy, including

Overall, in most domains, deployment of low-emissions technologies is only at about 10 percent of 
the levels required by 2050 under the energy transition.51 

Particularly in recent years, there has been momentum on many—but not all—fronts. For instance, 
around 90 percent of all battery EV sales and almost 60 percent of solar and wind power capacity 
added occurred in the past five years.52 In this period, battery EV sales grew by more than 45 percent 
a year, and solar and wind power capacity added grew at a rate of more than 25 percent annually. In 
these cases, sustaining such growth rates would be compatible with the envisaged energy transition 
by 2050. 

However, the sheer scale of what would still be needed cannot be underestimated. Sustaining rapid 
growth is not guaranteed. Most of the progress to date has been in relatively easy use cases, such 
as the deployment of passenger EVs, rather than in the more challenging case of long-haul heavy-
duty trucking, which involves longer trips and greater payloads. And while rapid growth has been 
seen in some areas like solar, this has not yet been true across the board. In some cases, such as the 
low-emissions primary production (excluding recycling) of large industrial materials; hydrogen; and 
carbon capture, less than 1 percent of required deployment by 2050 has been achieved thus far. 

In each of the seven domains, much would need to change. In order to understand and size the 
degree to which each domain would have to be transformed, this research primarily uses the 2023 
McKinsey Achieved Commitments scenario.53 This scenario (and, in some cases, other similar 
scenarios) is not meant to be a forecast of the pace and manner in which the energy transition will 
play out. Rather, it is used to shed light on the underlying physical transformation economies would 
need to undertake if they are to meet their stated commitments related to the energy transition, 
and therefore the nature and magnitude of physical challenges which will need to be overcome.54 
This research considers periods 2030 and 2050, both typical milestones associated with the 
energy transition.55

 — Power. The power system would need to both decarbonize and grow as more people gain  
access to electricity and more parts of the energy system, such as mobility, industry, and 
buildings, are electrified. Overall, the power system would quintuple in size (generation capacity 
installed) between now and 2050. At the same time, the share of power that is generated 
from low-emissions sources would need to more than double to over 90 percent.56 More low-
emissions sources of power would be needed, including variable renewable energy (VRE) such 
as solar and wind, and clean firm power, such as nuclear.57 All in all, low-emissions assets have 
only been deployed at about 10 percent of levels needed by 2050. There are also new and 
rapidly growing sources of power demand that could impact the scale of the transformation 
needed in the near term. For example, in 2022, approximately 450 terawatt-hours—around 
2 percent of total global power demand—were attributed to data centers, including artificial 
intelligence and other applications.58 By some estimates, this demand could more than double 
to over 1,000 terawatt-hours as soon as 2026.59 Furthermore, most of the deployment of 
low-emissions assets today has been in comparatively easier use cases. As VRE penetration 
increases, managing the power system would become progressively harder because the 
intermittency of these assets would require a much more “flexible” power system than today; 
that is, one with more forms of backup power, storage, and interconnections of grids in different 
regions. Larger and faster deployment of these flexibility solutions would also need to occur 
in markets that have less developed power systems today. Nonetheless, progress has been 
accelerating across the world. China, for instance, has deployed more energy storage than any 
other economy in the world in recent years.60

 — Mobility. Decarbonization of mobility would require significant ramp-up of low-emissions assets, 
with both demonstrated and evolving technologies. In the case of road mobility, modal shifts to 
rely more on public and other means of transportation are being considered, as well as the use of 
hybrid vehicle technologies, but electrification to replace ICE vehicles with EVs is expected to be a 
critical lever to decarbonize the sector. Current deployment of EVs is only 3 percent of what would 
be required to decarbonize road mobility by 2050.61 Consider that while one billion EVs would be

on the road by 2050, only about 30 million are on the road today. To achieve the required scale-
up, the share of sales of EVs would have to grow from about 15 percent of new vehicles today to 
over 75 percent in 2030 and almost 100 percent by 2050. Today, EV deployment is concentrated 
in segments that are comparatively easier to tackle, including lower-range passenger vehicles 
in dense urban environments. China and the European Union accounted for about 80 percent 
of electric passenger cars sales in 2023.62 As the transition progresses, harder use cases would 
need to be addressed. As yet, for example, there are very few electric medium- and heavy-duty 
trucks on the road. Under the transition scenario examined here, this would need to rise to more 
than 40 million in 2050.63 The decarbonization of aviation and shipping is at an even earlier 
stage—less than 1 percent of energy consumption in these sectors comes from low-emissions 
sources, such as electricity, biofuels, and synthetic fuels.64

 — Industry. Decarbonizing industries would require deploying new technologies to abate both 

process emissions and heat emissions generated by the use of fossil fuels. The four big industrial 
materials—steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia—would be especially hard to decarbonize 
because they rely on fossil fuels both as feedstocks and/or as sources of high-temperature 
heat. In 2022, less than 10 percent of the seven billion tonnes of these four materials that was 
produced was done with low-emissions processes.65 In the International Energy Agency Net Zero 
scenario, that would need to rise to between 90 and 95 percent by 2050.66 Furthermore, almost 
all progress thus far has been in secondary production through recycling; virtually no primary 
production is a low-emissions process today, and this would be particularly hard because it would 
require new processes (such as carbon capture) and changes to the inputs required (for instance, 
use of biomass or hydrogen). The transformation is especially challenging in parts of the world, 
such as India and China, where high-emissions assets are still relatively new. Other industries 
beyond the big four may be somewhat easier to decarbonize because they require relatively 
lower-temperature heat that can be provided by low-emissions options that are commercially 
mature today and generally require less retrofitting. Nevertheless, a massive deployment of low-
emissions heat sources would be needed. 

 — Buildings. Heating and cooling make up the lion’s share of building-related emissions, and 

abating them would require deploying low-emissions technologies, notably heat pumps and 
district heating systems (among a few other options). Overall, deployment of heat pumps is 
only at about 10 percent of the levels required by 2050.67 Although high deployment is already 
occurring in colder climates in Europe, reaching the necessary deployment levels by 2050 would 
nonetheless require solving the most demanding use cases related to the use of heat pumps in 
the most extreme temperatures and addressing implications of large-scale electrification of heat 
for the power system. 

 — Raw materials. The energy transition would require many raw materials, none more significant 
than the critical minerals needed for low-emissions technologies, such as batteries, wind 
turbines, electric motors, and electrolyzers. Current supply is only about 10 to 35 percent 
(depending on the specific critical mineral) of what would be needed by 2050.68 Potentially 
complicating addressing this challenge is the fact that the supply and refining of the most critical 
minerals is concentrated in only a few countries.69 To ensure sufficient supply of critical minerals 
would require expanding supply by accelerating the development of new mines and refining 
plants. At the same time, demand would need to be managed through new technologies that are 
less mineral intensive, such as new battery chemistries or new types of electric motors. 

 — Hydrogen and other energy carriers. The energy transition would require new low-emissions 

energy carriers to assume some of the role currently played by fossil fuels. Hydrogen is a key one 
being considered (alongside other low-emissions fuels such as biofuels). Less than 1 percent of 
the 90 million tonnes of hydrogen produced today comes from low-emissions processes, and 
demand could rise significantly under the transition by as much as four to five times by 2050.70 
Moreover, increasing the use of hydrogen would depend on tackling challenges related to the 
production and transport of hydrogen. It would also involve substantially more demanding use

cases, expanding beyond the way that hydrogen is used today (such as in refining or in the 
production of ammonia) to areas where its use is nascent, including, for instance, steelmaking and 
dispatchable power generation and storage. 

 — Carbon and energy reduction. Alongside deploying low-emissions assets, ways of reducing 

the overall emissions footprint of current assets would need to be identified. One way to reduce 
the overall emissions of current assets is to increase energy efficiency (using less energy for a 
given process or use). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) finds that energy 
efficiency mitigation options could contribute more than five gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent to 
net emissions reduction by 2030.71 Another possibility is capturing CO2 either at the point of 
emissions or from the atmosphere. In 2022, only about 40 million tonnes of CO2 were captured 
through carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), and mostly in comparatively easier 
use cases.72 Under the transition, the role played by carbon capture from point sources could 
be at least 100 times larger by 2050, with about 4,200 million tonnes of CO2 capture capacity 
potentially required. This ramp-up in the use of CCUS would require addressing the current 
difficulty (and cost) faced in capturing CO2 in low concentrations in flue gases as well as 
developing storage solutions and new use cases for captured carbon. Capturing atmospheric CO2 
would be even more demanding.

This discussion offers a guide to what might be needed for the world to achieve its aspirations  
for decarbonization. Overall, the transition remains in its earlier stages with more difficult 
challenges ahead.

Deployment of low-emissions 
technologies is only at about 
10 percent of the levels 
required by 2050.

2. Twenty-five physical 
challenges would need to  
be addressed 

Across the seven domains of the energy system, this research has identified 25 physical challenges 
that would need to be addressed to progress the transition (Exhibit 4). This chapter summarizes all 
25. For more detail, see chapters 5 to 11. 

A physical challenge is defined in this research as a barrier to switching the high-emissions physical 
assets and processes of the current energy system for low-emissions ones. Challenges cover issues 
related to developing new low-emissions technologies and scaling them as well as the inputs, supply 
chains, and infrastructure needed to operate them. 

Overcoming these physical challenges would be especially complex because the energy system and 
the domains within it are deeply interlinked. It may not always be possible to address challenges in 
isolation because tackling one would often depend on making progress on another. This research 
looks not only at individual challenges but also at these interdependencies.

Challenges fall into three levels of difficulty 
All 25 challenges would need to be addressed in some way for decarbonization to be successful (see 
Sidebar 2, “Scope and methodology”). But they are different. This analysis categorizes them into 
three levels of difficulty, reflecting both the progress made to date in addressing them and the nature 
of the hurdles to overcome.

The starting point of this analysis is considering three specific features that make challenges 
difficult: (1) technological performance (assessed at a use case level); (2) gnarly interdependencies 
between challenges; and (3) degree of, and constraints on, scaling the deployment of low-emissions 
technologies, and also scaling required inputs, supply chains, and infrastructure. Each of the 
25 challenges is considered against these features and categorized into Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3. 

As an illustration, consider how the challenges in the mobility domain fall into three levels, as follows: 

 — Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least 
physical hurdles. For such challenges, technological performance needed from low-emissions 
technologies has been addressed for a large portion of use cases, and progress on bridging 
performance gaps in any remaining use cases has been robust. Some interdependencies may 
exist with other challenges, but they are not critical bottlenecks for most use cases. In addition, 
where applicable, scaling is progressing roughly on pace with the needs of the energy transition. 

In mobility, ensuring that passenger battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reach the range drivers need 
is a Level 1 challenge. BEVs can go shorter distances than internal combustion engine vehicles, 
or ICEs, before they need to refuel; an average passenger BEV currently has a reported range of 
about 400 kilometers, in comparison with about 650 kilometers for an ICE. Moreover, charging a 
BEV takes at least 25 to 50 times longer than filling up an ICE vehicle.73 However, even with a safety 
margin for range deteriorating due to extreme weather conditions, today’s average BEV is estimated 
to meet the daily needs of 70 percent of households.74 Overall, therefore, a substantial portion 
of use cases is already addressed by today’s levels of technological performance. In addition, 
substantial progress has been made in addressing remaining use cases where performance still 
lags. For example, the energy density of batteries is increasing by about 3 percent a year, and the 
average range of a BEV has risen by about 200 kilometers in the past decade.75

 — Level 2 challenges require the deployment of known technologies to accelerate, and associated 

infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. For these challenges, mature technological options 
are available. Their deployment or the scaling of important inputs and infrastructure faces 
constraints, however, and this sometimes also creates interdependencies with other challenges. 
Further acceleration would be needed to address these challenges.

Building more extensive charging infrastructure and supply chains for BEVs and fuel-cell EVs 
(FCEVs) is a Level 2 challenge. In McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, global 
public charging infrastructure would need to grow by 24 percent per year between 2022 and 
2030, from 2.8 million charging points to about 16 million.76 In the case of hydrogen refueling 
stations, the scale-up would be from a very low base.77 Manufacturing capacity for batteries 
used in mobility would need to grow tenfold, to about 5,800 gigawatt-hours by 2030.78 The 
concomitant scale-up of critical minerals supply that would be needed for batteries also creates 
an interdependency with challenges in the raw materials domain. 

 — Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological performance (often with 

demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning. 
For these challenges, technological performance gaps can exist for a large portion of use cases, 
which often have more demanding needs. Substantial progress is needed toward bridging 
these gaps. Moreover, such challenges often have critical interdependencies with other Level 3 
challenges, and the transformation is just beginning. 

Some low-emissions technologies in mobility do not yet offer the performance that would be 
needed by more demanding cases. Trucking, for instance, is difficult to decarbonize because 
it entails carrying heavy payloads over long distances, and this is particularly challenging for 
battery-powered vehicles with current levels of battery energy density. That density does not 
matter as much for passenger EVs because they tend to travel shorter distances with lighter 
payloads. However, even the best heavy-duty battery electric trucks available today could fail 
to meet roughly 20 to 45 percent of current long-haul trucking use cases with a single charge if 
weight regulations are not changed.79 Moreover, the transformation is just getting started—fewer 
than 1 percent of trucks on the road today are electric, and almost none of those run on long-haul 
routes.80 A new transformation would need to be kick-started to get electric trucks on the road in 
greater numbers.

Each of the 25 challenges is summarized and categorized into a level in this chapter. Chapter 3 
discusses in more detail the three features that make challenges difficult and what this implies for  
the hardest Level 3 challenges.

Sidebar 2. Scope and  
methodology

This research focuses on understanding the 
physical challenges of the energy transition. 
Important methodological choices were 
made to do this. 

The focus is the energy system, 
encompassing both production and use 
(including the current use of fossil fuels as 
feedstock for industrial processes). The 
system accounts for more than 85 percent of 
current CO2 emissions.1 Sources of emissions 
outside the energy system, including in 
agriculture, forestry, and other land use, are 
not included. Other important sustainability 
topics, including the preservation of natural 
capital and the impact of pollution beyond 
greenhouse gas emissions, are also not 
within scope. 

In each domain of the energy system, the 
analysis explores what physical asset and 
process transformations would be required 
when switching from high-emissions assets 
to low-emissions alternatives. Examples 
include switches from fossil-fuel-based 
power generation, such as coal power plants, 
to low-emissions sources like variable 
renewable energy in the form of solar and 
wind, and clean firm power like nuclear 
or hydropower in the power domain; from 
ICE vehicles to EVs in the mobility domain; 
and from gas boilers to low-emissions 
heat sources in industry or buildings. The 
associated infrastructure and supply chains 
that would need to be built to support these 
switches are also analyzed. 

Based on these transformations, the 
research then identifies 25 physical 
challenges that must be addressed for the 
CO2 emissions of the energy system to be 
reduced. These challenges were identified 

in consultation with more than 50 industry 
experts and academics within and outside 
McKinsey alongside an extensive literature 
review of analysis of the energy system.2

The 25 challenges are prioritized based 
on the potential of new, low-emissions 
technologies to abate emissions. Some 
exclusions help bound the scope of the work. 

First, challenges that are expected to affect 
only a small portion of total emissions are not 
included. Second, incremental improvements 
to existing assets that do not involve major 
switches in technologies are not directly 
discussed as individual challenges; two 
examples are improved ICE fuel efficiency 
and insulation in buildings. Nevertheless, 
their collective impact is recognized in 
Challenge 23. Third, as noted, the challenges 
focus only on the energy system; those 
related to the transition of agriculture and 
other land use are not discussed directly, 
although the role of land as a physical 
challenge is discussed as part of the power 
domain challenges. Fourth, the focus is 
on challenges of a physical nature; any 
challenges that are purely related to market 
adoption or policies are excluded. Fifth, this 
research does not explicitly cover challenges 
related to labor. Finally, since this work 
focuses on analyzing the physical realities of 
the transition, costs are not the main focus, 
although, as noted, physical realities can help 
shed light on cost challenges. 

The choice and precise boundaries of the 25 
challenges are subjective to a degree, and 
some challenges are broader in scope than 
others. Different taxonomies, granularity, 
or segmentation of some challenges would 
certainly be possible. For example, circularity 
and recycling are important cross-cutting 
challenges that are discussed in the context 
of individual materials, such as plastics and 
critical minerals, but they could be deemed 

challenges in themselves. The list of 25 is 
neither collectively exhaustive (as noted, 
a prioritization lens has been used) nor 
mutually exclusive (many challenges share 
interdependencies).

The challenges are categorized into three 
levels, reflecting both the progress made 
to date in addressing them and the nature 
of the hurdles to overcome. Three features 
of difficulty, discussed further in chapter 3, 
are considered to do this: technological 
performance; gnarly interdependencies 
with other challenges; and degree of, and 
constraints on, scaling.

In examining the 25 challenges, this research 
builds on existing analyses of the transition 
in three ways. First, the examination of the 
performance of individual technologies is 
done in the context of specific use cases 
rather than their technological maturity in 
general. Second, this analysis goes beyond 
assessing technological maturity to consider 
other physical challenges, such as the 
required scale-up of supply of critical minerals. 
Finally, it considers how the system as a 
whole interacts—including how a particular 
individual technology relies on others—and 
the implications of that interaction. 

Of course, the precise boundaries between 
the levels of challenges can be debated, 
and the classification into levels can vary 
by region. Parts of a Level 3 challenge 
could be categorized as Level 1 or 2. For 
instance, overall, decarbonizing cement is a 
Level 3 challenge that requires substantial 
technological innovation, but some 
decarbonization approaches, such as using 
biomass for heating or deploying clinker 
substitutes, are already widespread in  
some markets. 

A global view of challenges is taken, but 
deployment of different technologies varies 

1  Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes total about 37 gigatonnes, with about five gigatonnes in agriculture, forestry, and other land use. In the 

case of methane, more than 35 percent of global emissions arise from the energy system, from combustion and industrial processes, with the remainder split between agriculture 
at about 40 percent and waste and other sectors at about 25 percent; McKinsey EMIT database, 2023.

among regions. Some challenges may be 
more or less important—and more or less 
difficult—depending on the region.

Across challenges, the research looks  
at the required deployment of low-emissions 
assets in 2050, comparing it with today’s 
levels using McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved 
Commitments scenario.3 Other net-zero 
scenarios may have slightly different 
combinations of technologies and rates 
of deployment, but the broad trends and 
themes described in this research would still

for reasons of data availability.

 This research uses the 2023 McKinsey Achieved Commitments scenario because it provides detail across different economies and types of assets about the deployment  
levels that would be required for those economies to meet the climate commitments they have made. The scenario assumes that countries that have committed to net zero  
(some by 2050, some later) meet those commitments, and that warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. See Global energy perspective 2023, McKinsey, 
October 2023. 

Reducing about half of energy-system CO2 emissions hinges on solving  
Level 3 challenges
Eliminating between 40 and 60 percent of the energy system’s CO2 emissions depends on 
addressing the most demanding—Level 3—challenges (Exhibit 5).81

The power and industrial domains are the biggest contributors to the emissions tied to Level 3 
challenges, together accounting for almost 80 percent of these emissions. In the case of power, 
the emissions tied to Level 3 challenges include those that would require increased deployment 
of variable renewable energy sources to the point at which they make up a large share of total 
capacity; as well as, to a smaller extent, carbon capture in the power system.82 In the case of 
industry, the emissions tied to Level 3 challenges relate to the ones generated by the production 
of steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia.83 The remaining emissions tied to Level 3 challenges arise 
mostly in the mobility domain, related to trucking, aviation, and shipping, which account for about 
half of current mobility emissions.84

Quantification of the emissions associated with Level 3 challenges drew on the analysis in this report 
of what makes those challenges difficult to address. The potential of a given technology to contribute 
to abating emissions was assessed with consideration of its technological performance and maturity 
in the context of specific use cases, as well as any interdependencies with other technologies and the 
supply chains and infrastructure that they would require.85

As an illustration, consider solar and wind power. Despite these technologies typically being 
considered to be commercially mature, this analysis finds that their total potential to abate 
emissions depends on being able to solve interdependencies with a broader set of technologies 
with different degrees of maturity.86 This is because once solar and wind scale to provide a large 
share of all generation, the output of the power system becomes highly variable.87 As a result, for

these technologies to reach high shares of total generation, much larger amounts of assets that 
deliver flexibility, such as novel long-duration storage, interconnections, or backup forms of power 
generation, would need to be deployed. Therefore, in the context of use cases that involve large 
solar and wind penetration, the physical challenge of variability and the development of both larger 
and newer sources of flexibility would need to be addressed: a Level 3 challenge. 

In estimating the emissions associated with L3 challenges, we also considered interdependencies 
across challenges. Examples of interdependencies include passenger vehicles and heat pumps. Both 
are mature, but realizing their full abatement potential would require clean grids to power them. This, 
in turn, would again rely on addressing the Level 3 challenges in the power domain.88

Of course, the amount of emissions associated with Level 3 challenges could vary depending on the 
specifics of the decarbonization pathway being considered. However, the broad conclusions from  
this analysis would still hold. First, a great deal of progress on abatement is possible by addressing 
Level 1 and Level 2 challenges. Second, and crucial for the success of the transition, is that ultimately 
Level 3 challenges need to be tackled to achieve net-zero emissions.

The 25 physical challenges—a summary
Power
Addressing physical challenges in power is fundamental to the entire transition because abating 
emissions in the huge energy-consuming sectors—mobility, industry, and buildings—requires 
sweeping electrification under typical decarbonization scenarios. Two difficult challenges arise: 
managing the variability of renewables such as solar and wind, as they grow their share of total 
generation; and doing so specifically for emerging power systems that need to grow, often more 
rapidly and by more than advanced power systems. These two are classified as Level 3 because 
addressing variability challenges would require the use of novel technologies that have not yet been 
deployed commercially and face other substantial barriers. Four other challenges, classified as

Level 2, relate to constraints on scaling more established technologies, inputs, and infrastructure, 
where accelerated progress would be needed for the transition. 

 — Challenge 1: Managing renewables variability (Level 3). With the energy transition, VRE sources, 

such as solar and wind, would be required to grow and reach a relatively high share of total 
generation. As this happens, the output of power systems would become progressively more 
variable, exceeding demand on some days but falling substantially short on others. Consider 
Germany. VRE could potentially account for 90 percent of all power generation by 2050, in the 
McKinsey 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario. Nonetheless, there could still be about 75 days 
a year when VRE generation would be insufficient to meet a large share of demand (meaning that 
at least one-quarter of demand would have to be met by other sources) (Exhibit 6). VRE-heavy 
power systems would therefore require much more supply-side flexibility.89 This could come from 
storage (both power and heat), backup generation capacity (including thermal generation like gas 
power and beyond), and interconnections. Such flexibility solutions may need to scale by as much 
as two to seven times faster than overall power demand globally in the next three decades.90 
However, these forms of flexibility in turn face significant barriers relating, for example, to critical 
inputs (for some forms of energy storage) and other factors such as market design mechanisms 
(for backup generation). Most critically, some of the technologies that would be crucial for 
providing flexibility to the power system over the course of seasons, including novel long-duration 
energy storage (LDES) and hydrogen-based generation, would need to scale hundreds of times 
by 2050 from a negligible base today.

 — Challenge 2: Scaling emerging power systems (Level 3). Many countries, especially those that 
are lower-income, need faster and more significant growth in their power systems to increase 
access to electricity. Historically, power systems have grown by adding firm power sources 
such as coal, gas, and hydropower, which can deliver power consistently when needed. Firm 
power accounted for 80 percent of the increase in per capita power generation in China and 
India between 2000 and 2023, often in the form of high-emissions assets such as coal plants 
(Exhibit 7). But this trend has started to shift, and in the last 5 years VRE made up around 30 to

40 percent of growth in generation in these two markets.91 As emerging power systems aspire to 
grow at the same time as reducing emissions, VRE is expected to play a larger role. The challenge 
is that these power systems tend to have much less existing flexibility to accommodate VRE than 
mature power systems, given their relatively smaller size today. For example, relative to power 
demand in 2030 in McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, the existing flexible 
capacity of emerging power systems is only about one-third that of mature power systems.92 This 
largely reflects the fact that their thermal generation asset base, which could be called upon to 
provide backup flexible capacity, is smaller than that of mature power systems. More flexibility 
could come, as discussed in Challenge 1, in the form of thermal generation assets (such as gas), 
more interconnections, and more storage. And as in Challenge 1, novel technologies would be 
needed, but in this case to potentially deliver an even larger increase in flexibility.

 — Challenge 3: Flexing power demand (Level 2). Alongside supply-side flexibility, there may 

be more opportunity for demand-side flexibility in power as the world electrifies. This kind of 
flexibility could provide as much as 25 percent of the total amount needed to accommodate VRE 
in 2050, in the IEA’s Net Zero scenario.93 Possibilities include smart charging in EVs to switch 
demand to off-peak hours and even enabling EVs to flow power back to the grid through vehicle-
to-grid technologies. Industrial loads could become more flexible by coupling electrification 
with dual-source heating systems or with ways to store heat for future use (so-called thermal 
energy storage or TES). Some emerging markets could build more demand-side flexibility from 
the start through more flexible manufacturing processes, for instance. Most of the demand-side 
technologies required are already mature today and being installed, but expanding their use faces 
hurdles, such as accelerating deployment of hardware and software infrastructure; requiring 
asset integration; behavioral changes, such as accepting the need to shift consumers’ use of 
energy-intensive assets like EV charging and washing machines to different times of the day; and 
implementing system control measures to ensure the optimization and stability of the grid.94

 — Challenge 4: Securing land for renewables (Level 2). For the power system to quintuple its 
capacity even while decarbonizing, more land would be needed. VREs, in particular, have a 
comparatively large land footprint for each unit of electricity generated (accounting for both 
direct and indirect use of land). However, there is nuance in this challenge. On the one hand, while 
they need more land, estimates suggest that only 2.5 percent of technically available land could 
be required globally for VRE.95 On the other, various factors such as suitability (for instance, the 
incline of the land), regulatory restrictions (for example, distance to settlements), and competing 
uses could hugely limit the amount of available land for VRE in many economies, creating 
bottlenecks. Managing these bottlenecks would require measures to address land constraints 
and manage the amount of land needed, such as higher VRE efficiency, co-location with other 
uses, and deploying other energy sources that require less land. 

 — Challenge 5: Connecting through grid expansion (Level 2). With the growth of the power system 
and the addition of more geographically dispersed energy sources such as VRE, grids would need 
to become larger and more distributed, interconnected, and resilient. They may need to more 
than double in size by 2050, growing 40 to 50 percent faster than they are currently.96 However, 
lead times for the permitting and construction of transmission lines are long, especially in mature 
markets such as the EU and the United States, where they have tended to be between five and 
15 years.97 Among other initiatives, accelerating permitting with new streamlined processes could 
facilitate the expansion of grids.98

 — Challenge 6: Navigating nuclear and other clean firm energy (Level 2). Increased deployment of 
clean firm power, such as nuclear, geothermal, and low-emissions thermal plants (for example, 
hydrogen, biogas, and natural gas with CCUS), could reduce the challenges of variability, land 
use, and grid expansion. Nuclear is an example of a clean firm technology that is mature and 
gaining momentum. At COP28, for example, a group of economies announced commitments 
to triple nuclear capacity by 2050.99 Nonetheless, increasing the deployment of nuclear

requires managing complex engineering, supply chain, skills, and siting issues as well as safety 
considerations. In combination, these issues could result in long lead times, frequent delays, and 
cost overruns. Addressing these would require, for instance, standardizing the design of nuclear 
plants and building multiple plants using the same designs to leverage shared learning, training 
workforces in the skills they need, and developing necessary supply chains.100

Mobility
The energy transition requires decarbonizing different forms of transportation, including cars, trucks, 
aviation, and shipping. Relatively straightforward and broadly on track—and therefore classified as 
Level 1—are two challenges that relate to ensuring that passenger BEVs save on emissions overall in 
comparison with ICEs and have sufficient range.101 Scaling charging infrastructure and supply chains 
for road vehicles is somewhat more constrained, and therefore Level 2. Most demanding of all are two 
challenges relating to decarbonizing longer-range forms of mobility, including trucking, aviation, and 
shipping, where more fundamental performance gaps remain; these are classified as Level 3. 

 — Challenge 7: Driving BEVs beyond breakeven (Level 1). While passenger BEVs have no direct 

tailpipe emissions, they still lead to CO2 emissions during their manufacture and when electricity 
is produced to power them. For BEVs to contribute to decarbonization, they would need to be 
driven beyond their carbon breakeven point—the point at which their life-cycle emissions fall 
below those of a comparable ICE. This breakeven point depends on (1) the amount of emissions 
embedded in the manufacture of BEVs (for instance, larger and heavier batteries lead to higher 
manufacturing emissions); and (2) the relative running emissions of the vehicles, including the 
emissions intensity of the power grid on which BEVs rely and the efficiency of the ICEs they 
displace. Where grids have relatively low emissions, as they tend to in the EU, for instance, life-
cycle emissions of small and midsize passenger BEVs are already substantially below those of 
comparable ICEs. Here, BEVs would save 45 to 65 percent of emissions, compared with average 
ICEs over their lifetime even if the grid did not decarbonize further.102 At the global average 
intensity of grids, an average BEV could already lead to savings of about 20 to about 50 percent 
over its lifecycle. In countries with high-emissions grids, such as China and India, emissions 
savings tend to be lower. And if grids do not decarbonize quickly enough, there could be close 
to no savings in those countries for BEVs in comparison with relatively efficient ICEs (Exhibit 8). 
Ensuring that BEVs reach their carbon breakeven point and save emissions across all regions 
and vehicle types would require decarbonizing the grids that power them and introducing new 
manufacturing practices, including recycling, to reduce those emissions. Both of these are 
happening. For instance, the emissions intensity of grids in G-20 countries has dropped by about 
8 percent over the past five years.103 Global battery recycling capacity could grow by five times by 
2030 based on announced projects.104

At the global average intensity of 
grids, an average BEV could already 
lead to savings of about 20 to about 
50 percent over its lifecycle.

 — Challenge 8: Going the distance on BEV range (Level 1). Passenger BEVs drive shorter distances 

(with an average range of about 400 kilometers) than ICEs (with an average range of about 
650 kilometers) before they need to refuel, and refueling BEVs takes at least 25 to 50 times 
longer than for ICEs.105 Other factors, such as performance in different terrain (like steep inclines), 
weather conditions (such as cold weather), and higher driving speeds, can mean that the actual 
range of BEVs could fall by about 20 to 30 percent.106 Even factoring this in, however, in the 
United States where people tend to drive longer distances than in most other economies, the 
average BEV would enable about 70 percent of US households to complete almost all of their 
longest journeys without stopping to recharge—they would have to do so on fewer than five 
days a year. In the case of top-performing BEVs more than 90 percent of US households could 
have their range needs met.107 Continued increases in the energy density of batteries and the 
development of fast-charging infrastructure can help to serve the most demanding range use 
cases. Battery energy density is rising at about 3 percent a year, and the average range of a 
BEV has increased by about 200 kilometers over the past decade.108 Of course, other options to 
mitigate range issues could also be used. One example is hybrid vehicles, which combine internal 
combustion and electric engines and display higher ranges—although there are implications for 
emissions from using them.

 — Challenge 9: Loading up electric trucks (Level 3). Battery electric trucks may struggle to serve 
the trickiest long-haul heavy-duty use cases. For such trucks to have longer ranges, they need 
heavier batteries, but limits on how heavy trucks can be mean that this additional weight lowers 
the payload they can carry. Even the best-performing battery electric trucks available today 
may be unable to meet roughly 20 to 45 percent of current long-haul trucking use cases with a 
single charge under current regulations on truck weights.109 Furthermore, the transformation is 
just getting started. Fewer than 1 percent of the electric trucks that would be required by 2050 
in McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario are on the road today, and almost none in 
the case of the longest-range vehicles. Improved battery energy density, adjusting regulation and 
road infrastructure to enable trucks to carry more weight, and operational shifts such as route 
reconfigurations to align any mandatory breaks to when batteries need to be recharged could be 
options. Other low-emissions technologies, such as hydrogen-powered fuel-cell electric trucks, 
face less of a constraint on their payloads, but deployment of those technologies has been very 
limited. Scaling deployment would require a rollout of associated refueling infrastructure, from a 
low base today, as well as solving associated Level 3 challenges in the hydrogen domain.

 — Challenge 10: Charging up EVs (Level 2). For more low-emissions vehicles to be deployed, 

supply chains would need to be built out, and the associated charging infrastructure to operate 
them would need to be in place. Battery manufacturing supply chains would need to increase 
by about tenfold by 2030 under McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario.110 This also 
creates a substantial interdependency with the challenge of securing the critical minerals these 
batteries need—another Level 2 challenge. Moreover, refueling would require the number of 
public charging points for BEVs to increase six times globally between 2022 and 2030. In some 
areas, progress has been fast. China, for instance, has about three million public charging points 
as of 2024, more than the rest of the world combined.111 In the case of fuel-cell vehicles, scaling 
both manufacturing capacity and refueling infrastructure could be particularly tricky since 
they would need to grow from minimal deployment today. Only about 1,000 hydrogen refueling 
stations operate globally today.112 This would also require solving associated challenges in the 
hydrogen domain.

 — Challenge 11: Refueling aviation and shipping (Level 3). Less than 1 percent of current aviation 

and shipping energy consumption comes from low-emissions sources.113 It is difficult to 
decarbonize these modes of transportation because carrying heavy loads over long distances 
requires high-density energy, and these modes would therefore need a large scale-up in 
the supply of new low-emissions fuels (such as synthetic fuels, biofuels, and hydrogen or 
its derivatives) under typical decarbonization scenarios. This would depend on the ability of

developers of such fuels to secure long-term purchasing commitments from aviation and 
shipping buyers to create incentives to produce the fuels, as well as the availability of sufficient 
feedstock and low-emissions electricity to produce synthetic fuels. Supply of those fuels 
could be constrained given that they would also be required for other uses in, for instance, the 
power and industry domains. Furthermore, even with an adequate supply, airplanes and ships 
would need to be compatible with sustainable fuels. In aviation, up to 50 percent of sustainable 
aviation fuel can already be blended into the fuel of conventional jets. Future aircraft engines 
are expected to be capable of running on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel.114 In shipping, 
there is some uncertainty about the fuel mix that would prevail in the future. Because specific 
fuels would require different ship engine designs, shipping fleet decisions could be delayed 
by the uncertainty about the relative merits and availability of different sustainable fuels—
and therefore how new ships would be fueled over the next two to three decades.115 Other 
technologies are expected to play a role alongside sustainable fuels, but there is uncertainty 
about the range of use cases they can meet. For instance, trials of batteries for short-distance 
aircraft and coastal vessels are under way, but the batteries may not yet have the energy 
density to support longer distances.116 

Industry
Decarbonization of many industries is hard. Fossil fuels are used as feedstocks (inputs) and/or as 
a fuel for high-temperature heat in many processes, most notably in the manufacture of the four 
big material pillars of modern civilization: steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia.117 Decarbonization 
of each of these four poses Level 3 challenges.118 Decarbonization of other industries would not be 
as difficult, because processes tend to require lower temperatures and do not generally use fossil 
fuels as feedstocks, and the required technologies are broadly commercially mature. Nonetheless, 
decarbonizing these other industries is a Level 2 challenge because doing so would require 
retrofitting existing industrial sites to accommodate low-emissions technologies, and this would 
constitute a large transformation.

 — Challenge 12: Furnacing low-emissions steel (Level 3). Making primary steel currently relies on 
fossil fuels, mostly coking coal, both for the high-temperature heat required and as a reductant 
for the production of pig iron from iron ore.119 Decarbonization could require multiple technological 
pathways, each with trade-offs. Some of the required technologies and processes have not yet 
been deployed at scale, including direct iron reduction (DRI) with hydrogen, use of premelters, 
and carbon capture at blast furnaces, and their performance has limitations. For example, DRI 
processes are less flexible in terms of the input iron ore that they can accommodate, requiring 
higher grades. Reconfiguration of the assets, inputs, and value chains that support steel 
production would also be needed. In some economies, including China and India, the relatively 
young age and limited size of current steel assets could make such reconfigurations particularly 
onerous because the assets would not be due for relining or decommissioning—a natural point at 
which to deploy substitute technologies. Use of secondary (recycled) steel using scrap is mature 
and low emissions, but limits on the amount of scrap available restrict how much it can be scaled. 

 — Challenge 13: Cementing change for construction (Level 3). Making cement produces 
emissions in two ways, and both would need to be addressed. First, the “clinkerization” 
process releases CO2 from the chemical conversion of limestone into lime. Second, fossil 
fuels are burned to produce the high-temperature heat needed for cement production in 
both the clinkerization step and the subsequent calcination step. Clinkerization accounts for 
about 10 percent of energy used and requires temperatures up to 1,500ºC. Calcination, which 
accounts for most of the remaining, requires 900ºC. Abating emissions in both steps would 
require the deployment of multiple technologies, as well as substantial asset reconfigurations. 
Some technologies have not yet been deployed at scale. They include the electrification of heat 
to replace fossil fuels, and carbon capture approaches, which would require processes to be 
redesigned to produce purer CO2 than in traditional cement production. Other approaches are 
already commercially mature, including alternative fuels such as biomass, the use of clinker

substitutes or even alternatives to cement such as cross-laminated timber. Many such materials 
are mature and proven ways to abate some emissions in the shorter term, but the use cases 
in which they can be deployed have some limits, and other pathways would therefore also be 
needed to decarbonize cement production. 

 — Challenge 14: Cracking the challenge of plastics (Level 3). Plastics are largely produced from 
fossil-fuels feedstock, and decarbonizing them would require addressing the entire plastics 
life cycle with new feedstock options, such as bio or synthetic carbon sources; alternative low-
emissions heat sources, including electrification or low-emissions fuels; use of carbon capture; or 
advanced chemical recycling approaches. Most of these technologies and processes have been 
trialed, but not been deployed in industrial settings. They would require scaling new inputs such 
as biomass and low-emissions hydrogen, and substantial reconfiguration of existing assets, such 
as replacing gas furnaces with electric crackers. In the shorter term, using alternative materials 
like biodegradable bioplastics instead of plastics or mechanical recycling could contribute to 
decarbonizing plastics production, but scaling their deployment would not be suitable across 
some use cases.120

 — Challenge 15: Synthesizing low-emissions ammonia (Level 3). The main source of emissions in 

making ammonia is the production of hydrogen, which is a necessary input. More than 99 percent 
of hydrogen is currently produced in high-emissions processes using fossil fuels, such as steam-
methane reforming.121 Decarbonizing ammonia would therefore require scaling production of 
low-emissions hydrogen, either by capturing CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel reforming operations 
or by replacing fossil-based hydrogen with hydrogen derived from low-emissions processes, like 
the electrolysis of water. In both cases, these approaches would rely on addressing other Level 3 
challenges in the carbon capture and hydrogen domains. Another option is the electrochemical 
synthesis of ammonia, which involves converting nitrates to ammonia, but this approach is still 
technologically nascent and has so far only been trialed as small prototypes.122

 — Challenge 16: Heating other industries (Level 2). Other industries beyond the big four would be 
comparatively easier to decarbonize. Industries such as food production and paper, wood, and 
pulp production require only low- to medium-temperature heat for roughly 90 percent of their 
heating needs (Exhibit 9).123 Mature and proven technologies can decarbonize the heat needed. 
Options include electrification or other low-emission heat sources such as nuclear, geothermal, 
and concentrated solar power. Thermal energy storage technologies can also help. However, 
these technologies would need large-scale asset deployment, which would require retrofitting 
millions of individual industrial sites around the world.

Other industries beyond the big 
four would be comparatively 
easier to decarbonize.

1Excludes ~18 EJ of final energy consumption with insufficient reporting; excludes agriculture and forestry (~5 EJ). Across all industries, industrial energy 
consumption is categorized by the temperature requirements for both thermal and mechanical energy. High-temperature heat supports processes like smelting 
and chemical reactions, medium-temperature heat is used in drying and other moderate-temperature processes and often for mechanical energy demands, and 
low-temperature heat is applied for pre-heating or maintaining specific conditions. Mechanical energy demands, such as compression work, are typically met by

Buildings
Heating accounts for the largest share of emissions from buildings.124 Heat pumps could provide 
the majority of the heat required by buildings by 2050, according to the McKinsey 2023 Achieved 
Commitments scenario. While heat pumps are already commercially mature with dozens of millions 
installed throughout the world, deploying them in more than a billion homes and commercial buildings 
would require addressing two physical challenges. The first, relatively straightforward and therefore 
a Level 1 challenge, would be ensuring that heat pumps perform sufficiently to meet the tail end of use 
cases where temperatures are coldest and where heat pump efficiency declines. The second relates 
to managing the impact on peak demand for power from the electrification of heat in buildings, a 
more difficult, Level 2 challenge.125

 — Challenge 17: Facing the cold with heat pumps (Level 1). Demand for heating increases when and 
where temperatures are lower, and the heating capacity and efficiency of heat pumps in these 
situations also decrease. For example, when temperatures drop from 5ºC to minus 10ºC, the 
coefficient of performance of standard heat pumps almost halves.126 In general, research finds that, at 
temperatures of between minus 10°C and minus 15°C, the performance of many standard air source 
heat pumps drops substantially—in some cases, the amount of heat pumps can deliver (heating 
capacity) may even fall below needed levels.127 Specialized heat pumps designed for cold climates 
could offer an alternative up to a range of minus 20°C to minus 25°C. Overall, however, most people—
some 95 percent of the population—live in regions with minimum temperatures above such thresholds, 
leaving only a relatively small number of unmet use cases.128 Moreover, heat pump efficiency is 
improving, and this is set to continue. Together with more deployment of ground and dual-source heat 
pumps, which can perform better in cold temperatures, this could address the tail end of use cases.

 — Challenge 18: Bracing for winter peaks (Level 2). As heating in buildings electrifies, demand  
for electricity will increase, especially during the coldest hours of the coldest days of the year. 
More pronounced peaks in demand for power—typically occurring in the winter—would result, 
which could necessitate building an oversize power system. In the United States, for instance, 
research estimates that if all heating of buildings were to be electrified, peak power demand could 
almost double, and it could even triple in colder regions such as the Northeast (Exhibit 10).129

These accentuated peaks could necessitate building an oversize power system, but there are 
ways to minimize the extent to which this is needed, including improved efficiency of heat pumps; 
use of additional heating technologies, such as dual-fuel systems and district heating, which 
could deliver heat without relying on the power system; and shifting demand for power to other 
parts of the day by, for instance, combining heat pumps with TES. Improving energy efficiency, for 
instance through better insulation, could also contribute to reducing demand overall. 

Raw materials
Deploying the low-emissions technologies required to decarbonize other domains would necessitate 
a range of raw materials to be available in sufficient quantities in a timely manner. Particularly 
important are the critical minerals needed for low-emissions technologies.130 Ensuring that the  
supply of these critical minerals is scaled up quickly enough to meet demand during the transition  
is a Level 2 challenge. 

 — Challenge 19: Unearthing critical minerals (Level 2). Many low-emissions technologies rely  
on critical minerals, from lithium for batteries to rare earths for wind turbines and electric  
vehicles. As the energy transition advances, demand could grow by as much as sevenfold, 
depending on the mineral, in the period to 2030 under McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments 
scenario (Exhibit 11).131 There are sufficient reserves to meet expected demand, but additional 
supply often takes many years—sometimes decades—to come online. Current projections  
of supply based on announced projects would not be sufficient to meet surging demand, 
particularly in the period to 2030.132 Potential supply-demand imbalances could arise.133

1McKinsey MineSpans’ base-case of supply includes all operating mines (corrected for depletion and expected closure where relevant), and a selection of projects 
currently under construction or at the feasibility stage, and in most cases with financing confirmed. The high-case of supply includes, for example, some projects 
in feasibility stage and no financing confirmed, with adjustments for potential delays. Note that reaching this high-case of supply is by no means guaranteed, and 
would rely on many conditions being met, including the required financing and concurrent execution of multiple projects in parallel, which has not historically 
always been the case. Potential imbalances between required demand and projected supply are classified into three categories. “High imbalance” corresponds to 
cases in which demand is more than 50% higher than projected supply. “Medium imbalance” corresponds to cases where demand is more than 10% higher than 
supply, but less than 50%. “No or low imbalance” corresponds to cases where demand is less than 10% higher or even lower than supply.

Meeting surging demand is even more complex when the source and processing of a mineral 
are geographically concentrated in a limited number of economies. Many of the critical minerals 
required for the energy transition, including cobalt, lithium, natural graphite, nickel, and rare-
earth elements, rely on the three largest supplying economies for more than 50 percent of 
their extraction—and over 80 percent in some cases.134 Refining is even more concentrated.135 
To address imbalances would require supply to increase more quickly. In some cases, this is 
happening already. In 2023 alone, production of lithium and cobalt rose by 23 and 17 percent, 
respectively.136 Recent developments in new extraction technologies, surveying approaches, 
and modular construction could accelerate lead times. In addition, increased recycling rates 
could expand secondary supply. Even then, managing demand for critical minerals would likely 
be needed through, for instance, improved efficiency in the use of materials, substitution, and 
new technologies such as sodium-ion batteries and rare-earth-free motors. Some of these are 
beginning to be deployed, but the process is still at a relatively early stage, and there could be 
performance trade-offs, such as lower energy density in some battery chemistries. 

Hydrogen and other energy carriers
New energy carriers, notably hydrogen and biofuels, would also be needed to decarbonize the 
domains by acting both as a source of fuel and as feedstocks for industrial processes. 

Hydrogen’s physical properties could make it a flexible energy carrier that could potentially play a role 
in many different use cases in a low-emissions energy system. It has high (gravimetric) energy density 
(per unit of weight), which could be important for long-range transportation or long-duration energy 
storage. It can be used as a feedstock for many industrial processes, including in the manufacture 
of steel and chemicals. And burning hydrogen generates high-temperature heat. However, using 
hydrogen to a greater extent in the energy transition depends on addressing two particularly hard 
Level 3 challenges: harnessing hydrogen in new use cases while handling a range of tricky physical 
properties including energy losses; and building the infrastructure needed to enable use of hydrogen 
to scale from a very small base today. 

The third challenge in this domain relates to other energy carriers—biofuels—and specifically how 
much land use their scaling could entail. This challenge is classified as Level 2. 

 — Challenge 20: Harnessing hydrogen (Level 3). Hydrogen’s unique physical properties can make 
it a valuable tool for many use cases across domains, but they also make hydrogen particularly 
tricky to use. Hydrogen has low density per unit of volume when it is in its gaseous form, it can 
easily leak, and it is flammable. Furthermore, the hydrogen molecule goes through many steps 
before it can be used, and each stage involves energy losses. These energy losses matter 
since electricity costs can make up half or more of the levelized cost of hydrogen production in 
some regions.137 During production, a large amount of energy is needed to convert water into 
hydrogen, and more than 20 percent of that energy is lost in the process.138 To be transported and 
stored, hydrogen often needs to be compressed or transformed into other molecules. This, too, 
consumes energy, leading to as much as 5 to 35 percent of losses. Finally, energy is lost—ranging 
from 20 to 60 percent—when hydrogen is used, for instance to generate heat or power. Overall, 
as much as 40 to 75 percent of energy can be lost when hydrogen is used in power, industrial 
heat, or mobility applications. Where direct electrification options are available, they may often 
have energy efficiencies that are higher—for example when considering local use-cases.139 To 
scale the use of hydrogen, energy losses would need to be minimized through, for instance, 
innovation of new electrolyzer models and new configurations of production and transportation 
(such as the transportation of intermediates). Furthermore, hydrogen use could be prioritized 
for cases that can leverage its beneficial properties and where other low-emissions alternatives 
are less feasible. Examples include using hydrogen as an industrial feedstock or as very long 
(seasonal) power storage (Exhibit 12).

produce it. In that way, efficiencies between hydrogen and electric use cases are directly comparable since they have the same starting point (electricity). Other 
cases—fossil fuels or biomass—entail other forms of final energy and, as such, are not directly comparable and shown only for reference.

 — Challenge 21: Scaling hydrogen’s infrastructure (Level 3). Many projects for the production 
of hydrogen have been announced, but actual production remains limited. Few large-scale 
projects are operating and about 5 percent of announced low-emissions capacity globally has 
gone past the final investment decision stage.140 Scaling up the use of hydrogen would require a 
large expansion of its associated infrastructure. In the McKinsey 2023 Achieved Commitments 
scenario, for instance, electrolyzer capacity may need to be scaled thousands of times by 2050.141 
And powering hydrogen production could account for as much as 20 percent of total electricity 
consumption by 2050. As well as production capacity, specialized infrastructure would be 
needed to store and transport hydrogen if it is to realize its full potential as an energy carrier. For 
short-distance transportation, the length of hydrogen pipelines may need to grow by more than 
40 times in the IEA’s Net Zero scenario.142 This would include retrofitting existing gas pipelines 
to accommodate hydrogen. For long-distance transportation, where relevant, shipping capacity

could have to grow by over ten times in McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario.143 
Some innovation in transportation approaches like liquid organic hydrogen carriers and ammonia 
cracking could also be needed. 

 — Challenge 22: Managing biofuels footprint (Level 2). Biofuels can substitute for fossil fuels in 

some use cases, including aviation and heavy industry. They are particularly important in cases 
where electrification is challenging. The energy transition would require an acceleration of the use 
of biofuels and other forms of modern bioenergy (i.e., excluding traditional biomass use), which 
would grow by about 8 percent a year between 2022 and 2030 in the IEA’s Net Zero scenario— 
more than double the rate at which use is currently increasing.144 Continuing to scale production 
of biofuels would require managing competition for the land they would need. Developing new, 
more efficient biofuels could help, as would increasing the use of biomass sources such as waste, 
which does not increase competition for land. 

Carbon and energy reduction
Substituting high-emissions technologies with alternative low-emissions technologies would be 
vital for a successful energy transition, but so would reducing the total amount of energy required 
and therefore CO2 emitted—and capturing that CO2. These efforts could be crucial across domains. 
For instance, carbon capture could support the decarbonization of the power system through clean 
firm power generation, play a role in decarbonizing the big four industrial materials, and support the 
production of low-emissions hydrogen. But there are physical challenges. Two of the three identified 
in this domain have performance gaps with demanding use cases and where the transformation is 
just beginning, and, therefore, are Level 3 challenges: CO2 capture and carbon removal from the 
atmosphere, both of which would require technological progress and large scale-up of technologies 
that, in some cases, begin from a negligible starting point. The third challenge is improving energy 
efficiency. This is classified as Level 2 because the technologies are mature, but a large transformation 
would be needed to retrofit many millions of assets such as industrial sites and buildings. 

 — Challenge 23: Expanding energy efficiency (Level 2). Energy efficiency could help reduce 
emissions with solutions that use mature technologies, such as more efficient lighting and 
equipment, improved vehicle fuel efficiency, and industrial process improvements. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that energy efficiency mitigation options  
could contribute more than five gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent to net emissions reduction 
by 2030.145 But a step change in energy efficiency would require a large transformation by 
retrofitting or replacing millions or billions of individual assets, which would take time and effort 
and would come with deployment challenges and up-front costs. A potential complication is that 
any realized efficiency gains could result in rebound effects whereby higher efficiency does not 
lead to a proportional drop in demand.146

 — Challenge 24: Capturing point-source carbon (Level 3). Carbon capture, utilization, and storage 
(CCUS) refers to a group of technologies that, as the name suggests, capture CO2 from different 
processes to prevent it from entering the atmosphere (known as point-source capture), and then 
utilize or store it. These technologies have been used for decades but are mostly deployed on a 
relatively small scale and in high-concentration CO2 streams such as natural gas processing. In 
the McKinsey 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, carbon capture would scale by more than 
100 times by 2050. For CCUS to play a more significant role in decarbonization, it would have 
to be deployed in lower-concentration processes, such as in cement production or natural gas 
power plants. Thus far, little of this has happened because employing CCUS in such use cases 
could be three to four times more costly than it is in current use cases (Exhibit 13). This reflects 
the fact that more energy and equipment is required, and that new technologies would be needed 
to capture CO2 effectively at low concentrations. New innovation in CCUS technologies and 
processes would be needed to lead to more effective capture processes at lower costs.147 Once 
captured, a massive amount of CO2 would need to be transported and used or stored. Expanded 
storage capacity would be required, and new use cases for captured CO2 would need to become 
commercially feasible, including, for instance, the production of synthetic fuels.

 — Challenge 25: Capturing atmospheric carbon (Level 3). Direct air capture (DAC) removes CO2 
directly from the atmosphere. DAC can play a role alongside nature-based carbon-removal 
options.148 This carbon removal technology operates at lower inlet concentrations of CO2 than 
point-source carbon capture, which means that it consumes a great deal of energy. DAC currently 
captures only about 0.01 million tonnes of CO2.149 Under the IEA’s Net Zero scenario, the scale-up 
would need to be tremendous, to as much as 1,000 million tonnes by 2050.150 Overall, DAC is a 
nascent technology with only a few dozen facilities operating and none yet on a large scale; their 
high energy intensity makes their use challenging.151

3. What makes this so hard

Level 3 challenges are currently more demanding and further from being addressed than those in 
Level 1 or 2. But, over time, finding ways to tackle Level 3 challenges would be essential for cutting 
about half or more of the energy system’s CO2 emissions. The issue is that specific features make this 
difficult to do. Understanding them is critical to finding a path forward. 

All challenges vary in three key features that determine how and why  
they are hard to address
The physical challenges vary in how hard they are to tackle because of three key features (Exhibit 14), 
as follows:

 — Technological performance gaps. A new energy system would need to deliver the performance 
required by a wide range of use cases. But in some instances, low-emissions technologies have 
performance gaps in comparison with current technologies. These gaps especially matter in use 
cases that demand a high degree of performance. Consider long-haul heavy-duty trucking. Here, 
the use case currently demands accommodating heavy payloads and long driving ranges, which 
low-emissions battery electric trucks cannot yet sufficiently do on some routes. 

 — Gnarly interdependencies. In an interlocking system, attempts to implement solutions in one 
area may not be possible because of constraints in other areas. Often, then, multiple physical 
challenges would have to be tackled simultaneously. One example where such interdependencies 
manifest is in decarbonizing low-emissions steel, whose production would in turn require scaling 
a combination of hydrogen and carbon capture technologies.

 — Degree of, and constraints on, scaling. The sheer amount of scaling needed for low-emissions 
technologies compared with today can itself make the energy transition difficult. For some 
challenges, staying on the current course is sufficient, but for others the physical transformation 
has barely begun. Two broad issues could make scaling difficult. One is constraints on the 
supply of raw materials, manufacturing capacity, land, supporting infrastructure, and other 
inputs. The second is that significant scaling up from a low base could be hard in the absence of 
a track record of effectively deploying the new technologies at the core of the transition. Trying 
to deploy nascent technologies, even if they have been proven in experimental settings, could 
create execution challenges. 

Detailed analysis of 20 out of the 25 challenges in chapters 5 to 11 of this report explores how each 
stacks up on these three features and what this implies about how progress could be made.

Finding ways to tackle Level 3 
challenges would be essential for 
cutting about half or more of the 
energy system’s CO2 emissions.

Note: Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require the deployment of 
known technologies to accelerate, and associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological perfor-
mance (often with demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning.

Level 1 and 2 challenges face the least hurdles, but more scaling would  
be needed
In the three challenges characterized as Level 1, mature and established low-emissions technologies 
can already meet the performance requirements of most use cases. Where relevant, deployment is 
progressing at the required speed, and the relative degree of necessary scale-up and transformation 
is not as large as for other challenges. Nonetheless, continued deployment is needed, and additional 
innovation is often required to tackle the tail end of more demanding use cases. 

As an illustration, consider the Level 1 challenge of ensuring that heat pumps are effective in cold 
climates. Heat pumps are technologically mature and are already able to heat homes efficiently in

many settings and climates. Some best-in-class air source heat pumps even provide uninterrupted 
heat at below minus 25°C—and less than 5 percent of the world’s population experiences minimum 
daily temperatures like this even once a year.152 For typical heat pumps operating in these coldest 
temperatures, further innovation could help improve their efficiency and serve the coldest 
temperature use cases. And progress is already being made—the efficiency of heat pumps has  
been improving at a rate of about 2 percent a year.153

In ten Level 2 challenges, required low-emissions technologies are also mature and proven. 
However, scaling the deployment of these technologies and of the infrastructure and inputs they 
need often faces physical bottlenecks, including long lead times and competing uses for the inputs 
needed. Such constraints would need to be overcome to achieve the required acceleration in the 
pace of deployment. 

For example, in the case of expanding nuclear fission power, a source of clean firm power, the 
technologies required are mature, but a number of physical factors stand in the way of greater 
and speedier deployment. These factors include complexity in design and engineering, inefficient 
planning and construction, and the need for specialized supply chains. Addressing these constraints 
would require multiple and simultaneous approaches, including more visibility on upstream supply 
shortages, adjustments to make permitting faster and smoother, and increased use of modular 
construction and repeat deployment. Several Asian economies, for instance, have cut lead times by 
building identical nuclear plants in succession to avoid reinventing the wheel for each.154

In some Level 2 challenges, such as ensuring that sufficient critical minerals are available to support 
the deployment of low-emissions technologies, scaling supply is not likely to be enough. Measures to 
manage demand are likely to be needed, too, including scaling recycling and innovating to reduce the 
need for critical minerals in components, such as using alternative battery chemistries or rare-earth-
free motors.155

Level 3 challenges face broader hurdles, and new approaches will be  
needed to tackle them
The three features that make challenges hard are all more prominent in Level 3 challenges. 
Gaps in technological performance often exist, and coincide with demanding use cases. Many 
Level 3 challenges rely on solving other Level 3 challenges and require massive scaling, with the 
transformation just beginning and a lack of a track record of deployment. All these factors make 
addressing Level 3 challenges particularly tricky. Doing so would likely require innovation in individual 
technologies to be paired with changes in how the energy system works.

Level 3 challenges would require navigating larger performance gaps associated with  
more-demanding use cases 
In Level 3 challenges, the low-emissions technologies that would be required still often face 
performance gaps where the technology cannot yet fully replicate at least one critical property of the 
current energy system. Dispatchability and transportability are two examples. In power, the lack of 
dispatchability can be a more significant issue in systems with large shares of VRE. In the case of new 
energy carriers, hydrogen and some of its derivatives are harder and more expensive to transport 
than fossil fuels.

Such performance gaps may also be present in Level 1 and 2 challenges, but Level 3 challenges stand 
out because those gaps typically occur where the use case is also more demanding. 

Decarbonization of each of the big four industrial materials presents a Level 3 challenge that 
illustrates this feature. Steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia production currently rely on fossil fuels 
as sources of high-temperature heat and/or as feedstocks. In cement production, for example, the 
high-temperature heat required for clinkerization has thus far proven to be hard to replicate with 
electrification (although pilots have emerged that attempt to do this).156 In steelmaking, replacing 
blast furnaces that use coking coal as a feedstock for the reduction process is hard because, among 
other factors, alternative processes such as hydrogen-based DRI are less flexible in the type of iron

ore input that they can accommodate. In the case of plastics, fossil fuels are currently the feedstocks 
that provide the molecules that are the building blocks of these materials. By contrast, a range of 
other industries such as food manufacturing do not use fossil fuels as feedstocks, and their heating 
needs can easily be electrified because they need relatively lower temperatures where electrification 
is more straightforward, making decarbonization of other industries a Level 2 challenge.

The same collision between performance gaps and demanding use cases appears in other domains, 
too. In mobility, gaps in the energy density of batteries affect long-haul trucking, a Level 3 challenge, 
more than passenger vehicles. Carbon capture technologies do not yet perform well enough where 
CO2 is present in low concentrations in flue gas streams.

In most Level 3 challenges, this combination of performance gaps and demanding use cases 
also creates uncertainty about which, if any, combination of low-emissions technologies could 
replicate the performance of the current energy system. While multiple technological options 
appear promising and are being explored, if this uncertainty persists over time, it can make focusing 
investment and deployment efforts effectively more difficult. 

Addressing performance gaps would require more innovation and commercial scaling of promising 
new approaches. New electrification approaches in industry currently being tested could produce 
the high temperatures required by cement and plastics, for example, but have not yet been deployed 
commercially on an industrial scale. In the case of steel, new processes using premelters could 
enable DRI-based approaches to accommodate lower grades of iron ore. But innovation of individual 
technologies may not be sufficient to fully match current performance levels in all cases. For example, 
advances in battery technologies such as solid-state batteries could double energy density and 
enable longer ranges, but even these batteries would be about 20 times less (gravimetric or per 
unit weight) energy dense than diesel.157 In other cases, the performance profiles of low-emissions 
technologies are inherently different. For example, while solar and wind innovations have improved 
capacity factors, these technologies are intrinsically variable in their output.

The implication is not that a new energy system can never serve the most demanding use cases, 
but that achieving that goal would necessitate innovation of individual technologies and, in some 
cases, reconfiguration at the system level—changing the way low- and high-emissions technologies 
mesh together to deliver higher performance. In the case of solar and wind technologies, this could 
mean reconfiguring the power system to deliver more flexible supply through storage, backup 
power sources, and more interconnections, or making demand more flexible. In a nutshell, the new 
energy system would need to evolve to make the most of the performance profile of low-emissions 
technologies and the way they work together (this is described in more detail in chapter 4). 

Level 3 challenges face gnarly interdependencies that would require systemic interventions 
Addressing Level 3 challenges often tends to depend on tackling other Level 3 challenges, 
compounding the difficulty of making progress and arguing for the need to consider the entire system 
as the transition unfolds. Deploying low-emissions trucks and decarbonizing steel illustrate these 
gnarly interdependencies (Exhibit 15). 

In some cases, of course, solving Level 3 challenges is dependent on addressing relatively less 
demanding challenges. Consider the example of low-emissions trucks, a Level 3 challenge. In the 
case of battery-powered trucks, two Level 2 challenges would need to be tackled: unearthing 
minerals (required for the production of batteries) and expanding charging networks. But in the case 
of fuel-cell electric trucks, multiple Level 3 challenges come into play. Fuel-cell electric trucks require 
low-emissions hydrogen, and securing it would require solving Level 3 challenges in that domain. In 
turn, hydrogen would require a great degree of low-emissions power, creating an interdependency 
with the Level 3 challenge of managing renewables variability. And this interdependency cuts both 
ways: balancing the intermittency of renewables may require hydrogen as a clean backup source of 
power at times when VRE generation is lower.

Several Level 3 challenges are linked in efforts to develop low-emissions steel, too. As discussed 
in chapter 2, DRI is a key technology for the decarbonization of steel, but its deployment would 
require solving Level 3 challenges related to hydrogen and power. Another option being considered 
is retrofitting blast furnaces with carbon capture technologies, creating an interdependency with 
another Level 3 challenge.

These interdependencies could well influence how multiple challenges are addressed. For instance, 
decisions on how best to produce low-emissions steel could depend on whether it is easier—or 
faster—to deploy hydrogen or carbon capture. This could, in turn, vary among regions.

Multiple actors in different sectors would likely need to coordinate to create solutions or projects that 
address multiple challenges simultaneously. One example of this in action is the HYBRIT project in 
Sweden, which aims to create low-emissions steel through hydrogen-based DRI technologies and 
involves a collaboration among companies in the mining, energy, and steelmaking sectors.158

Level 3 challenges require kick-starting entirely new transformations
In Level 3 challenges, the transformation is just beginning, and large scale-ups lie ahead—sometimes 
by hundreds of times or more in novel LDES, and new use cases for carbon capture and hydrogen 
electrolyzers, for example. The sheer scale of substituting thousands and sometimes millions of 
assets from scratch is hard given that there is little or no execution track record in Level 3 challenges 
and therefore a good chance of more “unknown unknowns” emerging. 

Moreover, if and when deployment accelerates, putting in place the necessary accompanying 
infrastructure and securing required inputs could run up against bottlenecks. This has not happened 
to any great degree yet, because addressing Level 3 challenges is at such an early stage. As the 
energy transition advances, bottlenecks would likely become more material, as they already are in 
Level 2 challenges.

Anticipating and addressing potential bottlenecks is crucial for Level 3 challenges, as are the broader 
types of measures discussed previously for Level 2 challenges. In some places, this is happening. 
In the case of low-emissions steel, for instance, many mining companies have anticipated that the 
supply of high-grade iron ore would be a bottleneck, and they have been focusing on developing new 
projects for the extraction of higher-grade iron ore that is more suitable for DRI.159

Another way to mitigate the difficulty of handling large transformations would be to try to trim 
its scale. An option would be increasing the use of established alternative technologies, thereby 
reducing the need for more nascent ones. For instance, deploying mature clean firm power 
technologies, such as nuclear, where possible and where deployment challenges of its own could be 
addressed, would reduce variability of the power system and therefore the need for more nascent 
forms of supply-side flexibility. If use of energy-efficiency technologies were to increase, this could 
help to reduce the size of the required scale-up of low-emissions assets. 

But there are limits to the extent to which such substitutions could be deployed. For example, utilizing 
secondary steel—an established technology—is not suitable for many use cases, and modal shifts 
in mobility (for example, to rely more on public transportation or to use rail rather than low-emissions 
trucks for long-haul transportation) are often not possible for logistical reasons. Efforts to trim the 
size of the required transformation where feasible would be useful, but they would not obviate the 
need to execute transformations effectively for the transition to succeed.

4. Concluding thoughts

The path of the energy transition will not be straightforward, and stark trade-offs and consequences 
lie ahead. Taking time for the transition to play out, as in many physical transformations of the past, 
could allow for the physical realities of the transformation to be confronted more gradually with time 
to innovate and scale new low-emissions technologies, address bottlenecks, and reconfigure the 
system. While this may make navigating the physical challenges easier, such a path would almost 
certainly involve compromising on the climate goals that countries and companies across the 
world have agreed to, with consequences for rising physical risks.160 However, driving the transition 
forward without confronting physical realities would most likely compromise the performance of the 
energy system—and as a result challenge energy access, growth, prosperity, and support for the 
transition itself. 

Alternatively, stakeholders could confront difficult physical challenges head-on—in fact, they 
could use an understanding of physical realities to guide the way forward to an affordable, reliable, 
competitive path to net zero. While many open questions remain on what precise path would enable 
the physical challenges to be addressed, this analysis sheds light on some crucial ingredients that 
would have to be present in a successful energy transition.

More innovation would be needed, along with changing the way the  
energy system works 
Across the domains examined, the transformation required would be both deep and broad 
(Exhibit 16). In particular, to address the most demanding challenges, large performance gaps 
remain to be addressed. Detailed examination of individual challenges suggests avenues  
for stakeholders to consider (for further discussion, see chapters 5 to 11). These avenues include 
the following: 

 — Continue to drive technological innovation. Continued technological innovation and scaling is 
critical for progress on the path to building a new energy system. It could come in the form of 
higher energy density of batteries, more efficient hydrogen electrolyzers, and new electrified 
high-heat industrial processes, such as e-cracking. Yet despite the progress that innovation of 
individual technologies can offer, it may prove insufficient for building a new energy system that 
fully mirrors the performance of the current energy system. For example, even new batteries 
being conceived today have only a fraction of the energy density of oil. Innovation would therefore 
need to go hand in hand with other approaches to building a high-performing energy system.

 — Change how technologies mesh together to produce and consume energy resources. Beyond 
innovation, bringing individual technologies together in new configurations could raise the 
performance of the entire energy system. One approach would be to reconsider how the supply 
of energy comes together with demand for it. This is not a new concept and has been in place for 
decades, but opportunities to do so would multiply during the energy transition. For instance, the 
potential increased variability of low-emissions power supply could be balanced by increasing the 
flexibility of demand, thereby managing the need for large-scale energy storage technologies. 
Options include making demand for heat of different industries flexible using thermal energy 
storage or even using electric vehicles to send power back to the grid when it is most needed. 

A second approach could entail changing how forms of energy production, energy transportation, 
and energy uses interact. For example, energy losses in long-distance transportation could 
be minimized by transporting energy embedded in goods (for example, hot briquetted iron) 
instead of transporting energy carriers such as hydrogen, which would need to undergo multiple 
conversions to make it suitable for transportation.

A third approach, albeit one with some consequences for emissions, would be reconsidering 
how low- and high-emissions systems could be coupled together to address performance 
gaps for the most difficult use cases, at least in the short term. For example, natural gas could 
increasingly become a source of flexibility.161 Gas peaker plants can act as backup systems for 
variable renewables. Gas boilers in homes and industries could be used in the context of dual-
source (hybrid) heating systems that can switch between electric and fossil-fuel heating sources 
according to the needs—and economics—of the grid over time, helping to manage peaks in 
demand. Some of these solutions could be temporary, and the use of fossil fuels in these systems 
could potentially be replaced with low-emissions energy carriers or abated using other means like 
carbon capture.

 — Adapt use cases. The very use cases associated with how energy and materials are consumed 
could also be adapted. For instance, the lower energy density of batteries means that battery 
electric trucks cannot drive the same distance as diesel ones without stopping to recharge, 
but there are ways around this. Truck drivers often have to stop for mandatory breaks at given 
intervals. If routes were reconfigured and the location of depots adjusted, the trucks could 
charge during those breaks. Mature technologies could also be deployed where effective—so, 
for instance, more rail travel could substitute for electric trucks.162 Similarly, decarbonizing some 
industrial materials is challenging, and it may make sense to explore the feasibility of using 
alternative materials. Cross-laminated timber could, it has been estimated, be applied to more 
than 10 percent of the use cases that currently use cement, and potentially many times more 
than that.163

Which of these three broad approaches is most suitable will vary by domain and among regions, and 
more work is needed to identify the details of a viable approach in different contexts. What is clear, 
however, is that innovation and such reconfigurations of the energy system would involve profound 
changes to how the current energy system works. Implementing them would require action by many 
different stakeholders.

Understanding the physical realities can help CEOs and policy makers  
navigate the energy transition
Innovation and system reconfigurations are important, and executing on them would require 
Herculean effort from both the private and public sectors. 

CEOs could start by understanding how physical challenges could affect their pathway to net zero 
and impact their products and services. They could assess the full potential value at stake for their 
organizations from tackling physical challenges in their operations, in their supply chains, and 
through the products and services they can offer. Based on this, they can decide how to play offense 
to capture opportunities and create value for their organizations.164

Policy makers, too, have a crucial role in ensuring a holistic and coherent approach to tackling 
physical challenges. They would need to ensure that companies have the right incentives and 
enabling environment to factor emissions into their decision making, collaborate with each other, and 
engage in the hard task of transforming today’s high-functioning energy system. 

As physical challenges for the transition are tackled, it would also be important to consider how 
best to run two energy systems—the old and the new—in parallel in the near term, and to ensure 
that the ramp-down of the current high-emissions system and ramp-up of a low-emissions one is 
smooth.165 Some investments in the current energy system like transmission and distribution are 
often needed in any case, and can both improve today’s energy system, and make it easier to solve 
future physical challenges. Some investments can smooth the ramp-down and ramp-up; energy 
efficiency is an example. Finally, investing in “hybrid” technologies could be an opportunity to explore; 
such approaches would not eliminate emissions entirely of course, but could be options to consider 
that enable some near-term progress on emissions as broader physical challenges are resolved. 
Examples include hybrid passenger cars which could address vehicle range issues, and using hybrid

heating boilers (that alternate between electricity or other fuels) in industry that can enable flexibility 
of energy sources and even cost savings.

Plans for the way forward could be calibrated by carefully considering challenges across the three 
levels. This can help inform what challenges to address, how, and in what sequence. Key questions to 
consider include the following: 

 — For Level 1 challenges, how can near-term opportunities from the deployment of fast-maturing 
technologies be captured? Such challenges correspond to areas in which technologies are 
mature today, minimal interdependencies exist, and scaling is well under way. They offer potential 
opportunities for near-term value creation for organizations. Companies could explore areas 
in which they have a strategic advantage and the geographies that offer the most attractive 
prospects to play offense and create value. Doing so would also require understanding both the 
current and potential future costs of low-emissions technologies relative to high-emissions ones. 
Policy makers similarly need to understand what it would take to drive deployment in these areas 
in their regions as well as how to best unleash the potential of the private sector to capture these 
opportunities, for example via incentives and sending appropriate demand signals. 

 — For Level 2 challenges, what bottlenecks need to be addressed today to unlock the next 

tranche of opportunities? These challenges entail deploying mature technologies, but they face 
immediate or short-term constraints. The key is identifying and anticipating which bottlenecks are 
particularly important and the options to address them. For companies, this might mean actions 
toward securing the supply of critical inputs through collaborations with suppliers, building 
capabilities in supply chains to unlock supply, and considering how innovation could help manage 
the magnitude of demand for such inputs. In some cases, playing a role in unblocking bottlenecks 
also represents an opportunity for value creation. For example, regions and companies that 
are major players in the global supply of critical inputs and technologies could become critical 
to scaling the decarbonization of other organizations. Policy makers can play a role in helping 
coordinate action across stakeholders and in untangling constraints—for example, related to 
permitting for transmission and distribution or to land availability. 

 — For Level 3 challenges, where and how can these hardest challenges be addressed? Addressing 
these challenges is subject to the greatest uncertainty, and they have the furthest to go to scale. 
Companies can consider where they may be best positioned to resolve these challenges, and 
how. Approaches should be guided by where companies can create a comparative advantage, 
where there is potential for value creation, and based on a deep understanding of the features 
that make Level 3 challenges particularly difficult. Companies should consider where they 
individually may be able to innovate to address performance gaps or weigh—often in collaboration 
with others—the broader system-level changes in how technologies mesh together and how 
end-use sectors employ technologies that could also address performance gaps. Importantly, 
while these challenges are the farthest from being fully solved, there are still opportunities to 
make some progress in the short term, such as improving energy efficiency or using recycled 
inputs in industrial processes. Policy makers will have a critical role to play in helping to create the 
incentives to invest in innovation and in fostering cross-sector collaborations for broader system-
wide changes.

Of course, the nature and levels of challenges are not immutable. For each company, closely 
monitoring how the roles of policy makers, regulators, and competitors influence technologies, 
interdependencies, and scaling is crucial.

There is little doubt that the physical transformation of the energy system is complex and difficult. 
Nearly half of the 25 challenges—and about half of energy-related CO2 emissions—are in areas that 
are particularly tricky to address. 

The exact path forward remains uncertain, but it is clear that tackling these challenges would 
take individual and system-wide innovation and new ways of solving problems. The world has not 
yet figured it all out, but neither is the path forward entirely in the dark. In the past, new ways of 
transforming energy have been achieved that had been unthinkable, from liquefying natural gas to 
splitting the atom. Such ingenuity is now needed again. What lies ahead is a new energy transition on 
a monumental scale that would require setting a bold aspiration and proceeding with commitment 
and action. Above all, understanding the physical realities can help navigate the way forward to a 
successful transition.  

The exact path forward remains 
uncertain, but it is clear that 
tackling these challenges would  
take individual and system-wide  
innovation and new ways of  
solving problems.

Note: This research examines 25 significant physical challenges in seven domains at the core of the energy transition, categorized in three levels. 
Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require the deployment of known 
technologies to accelerate, and associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological performance 
(often with demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning. The focus is on physical realities because they influence 
the ability to design an interdependent system that has performance comparable to that of the current system and to reduce emissions feasibly. These factors 
influence cost and affordability. Nonphysical factors—notably cost—are important but are not the focus of this research. Assessment of required deployment of 
technologies primarily draws on McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, which assumes that countries that have committed to net zero (some by 
2050, some later) meet those commitments, and in which warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. This scenario is used because it provides 
sufficient regional and sectoral granularity for assessing required deployment. In some instances, this research also uses scenarios from other sources for reasons 
of data availability.

The power system is at the heart of the energy transition. Abating carbon emissions in the large 
energy-consuming sectors of mobility, industry, and buildings requires an electrified world. 
Electricity currently serves only about 20 percent of final energy consumption, about four 
percentage points higher than in 2000, and some 760 million people lack access to this source 
of power.166 Even at its current size, the power sector generates significant emissions because 
most electricity systems rely primarily on fossil fuels. On average, electricity generation produces 
about 445 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour in G-20 economies, although there are large differences 
among them. For instance, France, with extensive nuclear generation, produces 60 grams per 
kilowatt-hour. Germany produces more than five times that, at 330 grams, but is in the process of

decommissioning coal-fired electricity generation. India’s emissions are almost 12 times those of 
France at 715 grams.167 All told, the power sector contributes about 36 percent of the global CO2 
emissions of the energy system.168

During the energy transition, the power system would need to grow as end-use sectors like mobility 
and buildings electrify and decarbonize. It also needs to expand to broaden access to electricity 
around the world. In McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, total installed capacity 
would have to grow by about five times to 41 terawatts, and total electricity generation would triple to 
77,000 terawatt-hours. And these additions would need to come from lower-emissions sources. Only 
about 40 percent of total power generated today derives from low-emissions sources, with the rest 
coming from fossil fuels. 

By 2050, in this scenario, the share of low-emissions power would need to more than double, 
exceeding 90 percent. This would require adding more low-emissions sources of power, including 
VRE, such as solar and wind, and clean firm power. Firm power includes assets such as nuclear 
and hydropower plants whose output can be controlled (albeit not immediately) to meet fluctuating 
demand. Thus far, only about 10 percent of the low-emissions assets required by 2050 have been 
deployed. There are also new and rapidly growing sources of power demand that could impact 
the scale of the transformation needed in the near term. For example, in 2022, approximately 
450 terawatt-hours—around 2 percent of total global power demand—were attributed to data 
centers, including artificial intelligence and other applications.169 By some estimates, this demand 
could more than double to over 1,000 terawatt-hours as soon as 2026.170 Furthermore, most of the 
deployment of low-emissions assets to date has been in comparatively easier use cases where 
VRE penetration has been relatively low. VRE is, by its nature, intermittent—there are periods when 
the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. This creates a management issue for the power 
system. As VRE penetration increases, that management becomes incrementally harder, and 
additional backup capacity would be needed to cope with intermittency. 

This chapter focuses on six interdependent physical challenges that would need to be addressed in 
order to power the world through the energy transition: (1) managing renewables variability; (2) scaling 
emerging power systems; (3) flexing power demand; (4) securing land for renewables; (5) connecting 
through grid expansion; and (6) navigating nuclear and other clean firm energy.

The extent of decarbonization that is realizable in other domains would depend on decarbonizing 
the power system on which they would depend for providing low-emissions energy. This analysis 
identifies two fundamental and difficult challenges that relate to managing the variability of 
intermittent renewables, including in economies that are still growing their power systems. Both are 
classified as Level 3 challenges because more variable power systems are more demanding use 
cases that require new forms of flexibility. The four other challenges categorized as Level 2 require 
the deployment of known technologies to accelerate and require associated infrastructure and 
inputs to be scaled.171

Challenge 1: Managing renewables variability (Level 3)
Historically, electrical systems have been built on the backbone of firm energy generation. A key 
part of the energy transition would involve deploying VRE assets, such as solar and wind power, 
whose output depends on weather conditions and is therefore not guaranteed at all times. As VRE 
penetration increases, the performance profile of power system output would change, notably 
becoming more variable. The primary physical challenge, therefore, is how to manage the variability 
of the power system when VRE reaches high levels of penetration.

Tackling this challenge would require a high degree of transformation of the power system to increase 
the sources of supply-side flexibility to cope with this increasing variability. Some uncertainty remains 
about which technological pathways would be used to manage the variability, and very large scale-
ups of technologies whose deployment has been limited thus far would be required.

The variability of power generation increases as solar and wind are added into the system 
As the share of power generated through VRE increases, so do the variability of the power system’s 
output and its ability to meet demand at any given time. Matching supply and demand both within and 
between days becomes trickier. 

 — Intraday. In the course of a day, there are large fluctuations in both the supply of variable renewable 
power—solar in particular—and total power demand, which can lead to significant mismatches in 
supply and demand. In California, for instance, the intraday variability of solar output produces 
the “duck curve” as the grid tries to cope with sharp swings in supply and demand during the day 
(Exhibit 17). Demand that is not met by VRE supply—the residual net load—bottoms out around 
midday, when solar output peaks, and spikes in the evening, when solar output is not available 
and demand for power increases (the shape of this profile is what gives the curve its name). This 
mismatch means that forms of backup power are needed to smooth daily imbalances. Growth in 
VRE capacity in California has made the curve more pronounced over time. The spread between 
the peak and trough of residual net load more than doubled between 2015 and 2023.172

 — Interday and seasonal. Wind and solar output varies from day to day depending on the 

weather and, in particular, on the seasons. There can be long periods when generation is not 
sufficient to meet demand, and this can also be hard to predict, particularly in the case of wind. 
In McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, in Germany, for example, VRE would 
account for about 90 percent of annual generation by 2050, but this does not mean that VRE 
would meet needs on 90 percent of days. Based on detailed modeling of future power demand 
and the potential generation of renewables, McKinsey Power Model estimates suggest that 
on about 75 days of the year, one-quarter or more of power demand would not be met by 
VRE generation (Exhibit 18).173 On the flip side, Germany would produce more from VRE than 
it would consume on more than half of the days of the year. This mismatch would have to be 
smoothed over time by storing excess power to be used when needed, or over space through 
interconnections with other power markets.

The power system would also transform into a higher-capacity, lower-utilization system as  
VRE is added 
As VRE scales, higher variability would lead to a major shift in how power systems evolve. VRE-
heavy systems require much faster growth in installed generation capacity than in actual generation. 
Consider Germany again. In McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, the capacity of 
Germany’s system would triple, while generation would increase by about 85 percent (Exhibit 19). 

The reason more installed capacity would be needed relative to increases in power generation is the 
fact that VRE assets usually have low utilization rates—also called capacity factors—in comparison 
with thermal-based assets, because their output fluctuates with sun and wind resources. While gas 
plants employed to generate baseload can have about 60 to 70 percent capacity factors over the 
course of a year, US utility-scale solar capacity factors average about 25 percent.174

Power systems with high VRE penetration would also have lower utilization of the remaining assets, 
notably thermal generation assets. In Germany, for instance, the average utilization rate of the 
thermal generation system, comprising conventional assets such as gas, coal, and biomass, and, 
in the future, potentially even new assets such as hydrogen turbines, could drop from a baseline of 
about 35 percent today to below 10 percent in 2050.175 This is because these assets would become 
providers of flexibility—rapidly adjusting generation to match demand not met by VRE assets—
instead of running continuously as providers of baseload (see the next section for further discussion 
on this point). 

These changes in the utilization of existing assets mean that in systems with a high share of VRE, the 
system cost is not just the result of the average generation costs (often studied using levelized cost 
of electricity, or LCOE, metrics) but is also affected by flexibility costs. For example, as the thermal 
system faces reduced utilization, its relative cost per unit of energy generated increases because 
fixed costs are diluted by smaller total generation.176

As VRE scales, higher variability 
would lead to a major shift in 
how power systems evolve.

Addressing the variability of solar and wind would require a large scale-up of flexibility solutions 
Additional flexibility would need to be built into power systems to manage the intermittency of VRE. 
On the supply side, there are a number of ways to add flexibility to deliver power when and where 
it is needed, including energy storage, backup thermal generation (as previously discussed), and 
more extensive interconnections with other power systems (see Sidebar 3, “Power systems exhibit

different forms of supply-side flexibility”). Demand-side flexibility could also play an important role (as 
discussed later in this chapter as part of Challenge 3). 

For the majority of economies that achieve high VRE penetration, defined here as more than 
50 percent of total supply by 2050, the amount of generation that total flexible capacity (assets and 
interconnections that could quickly deliver power when required) could deliver would have to grow 
two to three times faster than overall demand for power.177 This would be the case, for example, in 
Brazil, China, Germany, and Italy. In other economies, including India and South Africa, the increase 
could be substantially larger, at close to seven times (Exhibit 20). 

Different scenarios and options could lead to different technology mixes, such as more storage 
or more flexible clean thermal generation. But while the specific mix may vary, multiple forms of 
flexibility are likely to be required, as they play a complementary role to some extent. Some are more 
suitable for short-term flexibility needs, such as Li-ion batteries. Others, such as novel LDES, are 
more suited for longer-term needs.178

It should be noted that the additional flexibility required is likely to increase nonlinearly with the  
VRE share in power generation—required flexibility rises increasingly steeply once higher shares  
of VRE penetration are achieved in order for the system to cope with the increased variability and 
lower proportion of installed capacity that is dispatchable.179

Two main factors dictate differences in the total amount of required flexibility additions in different 
markets. The first is how much flexibility already exists. Economies that can already draw upon a 
high thermal generation asset base to meet their flexibility needs are less likely to need to scale it 
significantly, especially in the short term. The second is what renewable endowments are present. 
Economies with complementary and favorable sun and wind profiles in particular would require 
comparatively less total flexibility as a share of total demand, because uncorrelated wind and solar 
generation can be complementary and create a smoother profile overall.

Regardless of the extent to which flexibility needs to increase, different forms of supply-side 
flexibility are likely to exist, and the roles played by each form could change over time. For some 
markets (in particular advanced markets) with existing thermal generation footprints, this system 
is likely to play the lead role in flexibility, at least over the next decade. These markets have the 
potential to effectively repurpose existing thermal assets to provide flexibility and can defer 
building net new flexible capacity such as storage. As VRE penetration increases, capacity factors 
of thermal generation assets would therefore decline, but their actual installed capacity would 
initially mostly be retained. 

As more VRE continues to be added and thermal generation flexibility is exhausted, economies may 
reach a tipping point at which storage becomes the main source of added flexibility. This increase 
in storage could be achieved using both mature technologies such as batteries—often scaling up 
at least 30-fold for some economies in the scenarios modeled in this research—and as yet nascent 
technologies such as novel forms of LDES, hydrogen through power-to-gas, and other low-emissions 
fuels. By 2050, these nascent technologies could increase capacity hundreds of times from today’s 
negligible base in many economies (see also Challenge 2 for a discussion of emerging power systems). 

Total flexible capacity would 
have to grow two to seven times 
faster than overall demand for 
power between now and 2050.

Sidebar 3. Power systems  
exhibit different forms of  
supply-side flexibility

Supply-side flexibility can be built into power 
systems in three main ways. All can be 
beneficial, but each faces different physical 
constraints. (Demand-side flexibility is 
discussed later in this chapter). 

Energy storage. Storing energy for later 
use could play the largest role. Some forms 
of storage are already mature. Roughly 
250 gigawatts of global electricity storage 
currently exist, about two-thirds from 
pumped hydro storage (PHS) and the rest 
from Li-ion batteries.1 Although these 
storage technologies are commercially 
mature, they face substantial physical 
challenges in their ability to scale up—in 
particular, for PHS, limits on the availability 
of suitable sites and, for Li-ion batteries, 
insufficient supply of raw materials (see 
chapter 9 on the raw materials domain). 

Technologies that are currently nascent, 
such as novel LDES and hydrogen through 
power-to-gas, are expected to meet a 
large share of flexibility needs by 2050, 
potentially scaling hundreds of times from 
virtually no deployment to date. These two 
technologies could account for as much as 
one-third of energy storage capacity for 
power systems by 2050 in McKinsey’s 2023 
Achieved Commitments scenario. Novel 
LDES technologies can be thought of as a 

portfolio of many options. Some can store 
power for later use through mechanical or 
electrochemical means. Mechanical systems 
include, for example, compressed air, which 
is already being deployed and accounts for 
the majority of novel LDES power storage 
capacity announced to date, as well as 
gravity-based systems. Such forms of 
storage can be difficult to scale because 
they can need particular locations, such as a 
mountain or mine shaft. Other approaches, 
such as electrochemical applications 
(essentially batteries other than Li-ion), can 
offer flexibility on location and high energy 
efficiency but are not technologically mature 
and not yet deployed at scale. In some 
cases, storing heat through thermal energy 
storage (TES) instead of storing power may 
be preferred. TES systems account for more 
than half of announced novel LDES capacity 
to date.2

Thermal power backup. Existing thermal 
generation systems could be operated at 
lower utilization rates rather than providing 
continuous firm power, thereby creating 
flexibility in the system by being able to 
quickly ramp up unused capacity when 
it is needed.3 Most of these assets were 
developed assuming high utilization. 
Therefore, power markets would have to 
be designed or redesigned with regulatory 
support to make feasible the expansion 
and maintenance of low-utilization thermal 
generation assets, which can provide 
flexibility.4 Many markets do not have 

sufficient thermal capacity to provide 
flexibility, and building that capacity may be 
unlikely if low utilization rates are expected 
with a redesign.5 Another issue is that fossil-
fuel thermal systems, even at relatively low 
utilization, still produce emissions. In the short 
term, one solution would be using natural 
gas power plants for intermittent operation 
because they can ramp up very rapidly when 
needed.6 In the long term, turbines fueled 
by hydrogen or other low-emissions fuels, 
such as biogas or landfill gas, could provide 
flexibility with lower emissions. 

Interconnections. Another form of flexibility 
could be achieved by connecting separate 
grids to pool resources among regions 
or economies that may be experiencing 
different weather conditions: the sun may 
be shining in Spain but not in Germany, or 
the wind blowing in Texas but not California. 
The EU has set interconnection targets 
to encourage members to have electricity 
cables that enable at least 15 percent of 
electricity produced to be transported within 
the EU, although even this increase could 
be insufficient to meet the EU’s needs.7 
One limitation on the degree to which 
interconnections expand would be potential 
energy losses during the transportation of 
electricity over long distances.8 But there 
are also important nonphysical barriers, 
including “right of way” to pass along a 
particular route as well as alignment among 
stakeholders on the proper allocation of the 
benefits and costs of new lines.

 TES covers a range of technologies that allow for the capture and retention of thermal energy for later use. TES technologies include sensible heat storage, which stores thermal 
energy by changing the temperature of specific materials, such as silica or water; latent heat storage, which changes the phase or state of materials, for example from solid to 
liquid; and thermochemical heat storage, which uses reversible chemical reactions, such as hydration and dehydration reactions. Net-zero power: Long-duration energy storage

 Increasing generation from clean thermal sources could also reduce the total amount of VRE deployment required and reduce overall system variability. See Challenge 6 for

Each form of flexibility comes with physical barriers, notably technological maturity for  
some newer flexibility options
Scaling up flexible supply capacity to address variability would require solving physical challenges 
that each source of flexibility faces. The challenges run the gamut—from performance issues in 
certain use cases, to technological nascency, to the need for appropriate physical inputs. 

For example, novel LDES and hydrogen-based generation technologies, such as turbines, have 
high potential as solutions for long-duration flexibility for interday or seasonal purposes. In 
McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, they would make up as much as one-third of 
total energy storage capacity for power systems by 2050. There have already been encouraging 
developments. In 2024, the world’s largest grid-connected compressed air energy storage project, 
the Hubei Yingchang project, with capacity of 300 megawatts, came online in China.180 In 2023, the 
US Department of Energy approved 15 novel LDES projects for government support.181 However, 
neither technology has been deployed to a meaningful extent to date. Novel LDES projects are still 
relatively small in scale, and many of the novel LDES variants are completely new and do not yet 
have a track record. Widespread adoption of these technologies would depend on their commercial 
demonstration and cost developments.182 The fact that they are at a very early stage in their 
development poses a significant technological risk, which would need to be addressed when tackling 
the physical challenge of variability at high VRE penetrations.

Deployment of other types of storage has increased rapidly. There was a step change in adding 
battery storage globally in 2023, with industry deployment roughly doubling to about 40 gigawatts.183 
China led the way, accounting for more than 50 percent of annual additions and deploying roughly as 
much storage in 2023 as the entire world did in 2022.184 But, for a number of reasons, mature forms 
of storage still face constraints on scaling that would need to be addressed. For example, Li-ion 
batteries are most suitable for multihour rather than longer-term (multiday/seasonal) energy storage. 
Another factor is whether critical inputs are available. Li-ion batteries rely on minerals that may be 
in short supply and would also be required for mobility applications (see chapter 6 on the mobility 
domain and chapter 9 on the raw materials domain). 

The primary issue for thermal generation systems is the need for new market design mechanisms 
that enable them to be viable even at lower utilization levels, while for interconnections, the main 
issues are limits on available land and, often, long lead times. 

§ § §

Managing the variability of renewables-heavy power systems is a Level 3 challenge, and one that 
would have to be addressed to support the decarbonization not only of the overall power system but 
also of other sectors that rely on power. 

As more VRE is deployed, the performance of power systems would change, and supply would 
become more variable. Addressing this variability would require deployment of multiple options, 
including various types of energy storage, thermal backup systems, and interconnections. While 
some of these forms of flexibility are mature, deploying them would require solving issues related to 
critical inputs (for energy storage) as well as nonphysical factors such as market design mechanisms 
(for thermal backup systems). Some flexibility solutions would require additional innovation, 
particularly in the cases of newer forms of flexibility whose deployment to date is close to zero  
and that face technological uncertainty—notably, novel LDES and hydrogen.

Challenge 2: Scaling emerging power systems (Level 3)
Many people, particularly in emerging economies where power systems are less developed than 
those in advanced economies, have relatively low access to power from the grid. About half of the 
world’s population consumes less than two megawatt-hours of electricity per capita per year, which 
is approximately one-sixth of the per capita consumption in the United States.185

Emerging power systems face a different and more complex physical challenge than mature power 
systems. This applies not only in the degree to which they need to scale, but also in the extent to 
which they would need to achieve a faster ramp-up of flexibility to accommodate increasing levels of 
VRE penetration.

In McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, emerging power systems would need 
to scale capacity as much as sixfold from 2022 to 2050 as they broaden access to electricity, 
compared with threefold in the case of more mature systems. The need to ramp up the deployment 
of renewable energy in emerging power systems starting from a lower base would be even larger—
an increase of 18 times, compared with eight times in mature systems. They would also need 
to navigate uncertain technological pathways in their efforts to provide flexibility and manage 
increasing penetration of VRE. 

Emerging power systems have an opportunity to broaden access to power while decarbonizing 
and to make the system more reliable. In African economies, the frequency and duration of 
electric outages are nine times higher than in advanced economies.186 To pull this off would require 
recognizing the particular needs of these economies, designing power systems to meet them, 
thoughtfully staging their development, and ensuring the most appropriate flexibility mix. Overall, a 
high degree of transformation of their power systems would be needed.

Power systems have historically been built on firm power 
Around the world, power systems have tended to be built around firm power. As emerging power 
systems attempt to expand and decarbonize, they would need to add both firm power and VRE, and 
strike the right balance between the two.

Most of the deployment of new VRE in recent years has been in mature power systems where overall 
per capita power generation did not grow. In Germany and the United States, for instance, VRE 
generation increased from virtually zero in 2000 to about 2.0 to 2.5 megawatt-hours per capita in 
2023, while total generation per capita remained roughly stable. These economies and others were 
able, in part, to add VRE because the existing firm power system was sufficiently flexible. Germany, 
for instance, was able to increase generation from VRE without developing new sources of flexibility 
by using existing thermal generation assets, mostly coal and gas (albeit at lower utilization rates). 

Those economies that have expanded overall power generation have done so mostly on the back of 
firm power. China and India, for instance, increased per capita power generation from 2000 to 2023 
by 8 percent and 4 percent a year, respectively, of which more than 80 percent was firm (mostly coal) 
in both cases (Exhibit 21). But this trend has started to shift. In the last 5 years, VRE made up around 
30 to 40 percent of growth in generation in these two markets.187 Nigeria grew per capita power 
generation by only 2 percent per year between 2000 and 2023, with virtually all the growth from firm 
sources (mostly natural gas).

Emerging power systems would need to build more flexibility to accommodate VRE
Emerging power systems have less flexible capacity than mature ones to accommodate extensive 
growth in the penetration of VRE that building a larger low-emissions power system would entail.

Mature power systems currently have about three times more flexibility available than their 
emerging counterparts. For instance, Germany and the United States have flexibility today 
equivalent to roughly 40 to 70 percent of expected average power demand in 2030, but economies 
such as China, India, and South Africa have only 10 to 25 percent (Exhibit 22).188 In large part,  
this reflects the flexibility provided by existing thermal generation assets in mature markets.

For example, in the United States today, roughly 75 percent of flexible capacity resides in thermal 
capacity, most notably gas generation assets.

As a result, in addition to adding proportionately more flexible capacity, emerging power systems 
would often need to do so relatively faster than mature power systems. Take Italy and India as 
examples (see Exhibit 20 in the previous section). In McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments 
scenario, Italy’s flexibility needs would mostly ramp up around 2040, when VRE penetration hits 
about 80 percent of total generation. However, for India, a doubling of total flexibility could be needed 
as early as in 2030, when VRE would account for 30 percent of generation.

They could achieve incremental flexibility in three main ways. First, they could add thermal generation 
assets such as gas, which could provide firm power as well as flexibility (although, of course, 
this approach could increase emissions in the short term). Second, they could ramp up storage 
proportionately faster. Depending on the specific geography and its needs as well as affordability 
considerations, these approaches could be used in parallel or sequentially. For instance, an emerging 
power system could prioritize building some gas assets in the short term and then roll out storage.189 
Third, in some cases, additional interconnections could create more flexibility.

Some emerging power systems have made progress in developing more flexibility. In a single year, 
China quadrupled new energy storage from about eight gigawatts in 2022 to about 30 gigawatts in  
2023. Of all energy storage tenders ever awarded in India, 60 percent were granted in 2023 
alone.190 In 2022, Egypt and Saudi Arabia announced the construction of the first large-scale high-
voltage direct-current interconnection between the Middle East and North Africa, creating flexibility 
for both.191

But despite such examples of progress, a long road lies ahead. After 2030, storage technologies 
would need to grow hundreds of times in some economies. Moreover, as discussed in Challenge 1,

novel technologies to provide long-term flexibility needs would also be required as emerging power 
systems reach higher levels of VRE penetration.

§ § §

This is a Level 3 challenge. The required degree of transformation would be considerable in emerging 
power systems and comparatively larger than in mature power systems, given that they start from a 
lower flexibility base. Addressing this challenge would require deploying a combination of sources 
of flexibility. Some of them are mature technological options, namely thermal generation, and could 
support flexibility in the short term. But as in Challenge 1, further down the line, novel technologies 
would be required, and deploying them would require additional innovation. 

Challenge 3: Flexing power demand (Level 2)
With demand for power rising quickly and new end-use sectors, from cars to industries, being 
electrified, there could be an opportunity to reengineer power systems and create new sources of 
demand-side flexibility. These forms of flexibility could complement the supply-side flexibility options 
discussed in Challenges 1 and 2. Adoption scenarios vary, but under the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario, 
the overall scale-up of demand-side flexibility capacity required could be up to tenfold in 2030 
relative to today.192

What does demand-side flexibility mean in the context of the energy system? Essentially, it involves 
offering users incentives to consume power at times when it is more plentiful—that is, when net 
demand on the grid is lower. This is not a new idea. About 50 gigawatts of demand-side flexibility 
is already in place in Australasia, Europe, and North America, split evenly between buildings and 
industry.193 Differentiated intraday power prices have been used for more than 60 years in some 
economies, encouraging people to run some appliances at night, for example.194

In a more electrified and connected world, the number and volume of options for demand-side 
flexibility potentially increase. They could include small adjustments, such as deploying automated 
controls of home thermostats to avoid demand peaks, or larger shifts, examples being using 
residential batteries or EVs to flow stored power back to the grid when needed and reconfiguring 
industrial processes by electrifying them and coupling them with TES. 

Increasing demand-side flexibility would need not only the deployment of new technologies, but 
also a high degree of transformation of both hardware and software. Estimates of the magnitude of 
increase in flexible demand vary, but under the IEA Net Zero 2050 scenario, more than one-quarter 
of total power system flexibility in advanced economies could come from demand-side flexibility  
by 2050.195

A portfolio of demand-side flexibility technologies would likely be needed 
Across end-use sectors, different technologies and assets could create demand-side flexibility.  
A combination of them would likely be required. 

 — Residential. Distributed energy resources could be pooled into residential virtual power plants 
(VPPs). These could include residential (“behind the meter”) storage solutions and appliances. 
VPPs can control the amount of energy homes and buildings use at a given time to reduce 
demand on the grid. For example, smart water heaters and smart thermostats can adjust when 
they consume electricity to shift demand to off-peak times, preheating or precooling the home 
when power is abundant.196 Similarly, residential batteries can charge when power is abundant 
and discharge during peak hours. Pooling such resources into a single VPP can provide utility-
scale flexibility that is comparable to that of a traditional power plant. For instance, estimates 
suggest that VPPs could create more than 350 gigawatts of flexible capacity in the European 
Union by 2050.197 For the sake of comparison, existing gas capacity in the EU sums to about 
192 gigawatts.198

 — Mobility. EV batteries can be used as spare storage capacity for the grid. Although patterns of 

use vary, on the whole EVs constitute a large source of unused flexible capacity. They are driven 
for only a fraction of the day, lying idle for many hours. Moreover, batteries in newer models 
have more storage capacity than needed for most daily use. For example, in the United States 
an average EV can power 400 kilometers a day against an average of 50 kilometers actually 
driven (see chapter 6 on the mobility domain).199 Two measures could help propel the use of EV 
batteries to create demand-side flexibility. First, smart charging could be switched to off-peak 
hours to lower demand on the grid when demand is higher. Second and more radical, EVs could 
act as additional storage for the grid. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology—currently nascent—
could enable an EV to discharge its battery to provide additional power to the grid. In the EU, this 
could offer as much as 700 additional gigawatts of flexible capacity by 2050.200 Pilots are under 
way in many economies. In the United States, California is piloting a program and considering 
mandating bidirectional chargers by 2027 that would be needed for V2G to work.201 The largest 
EV school bus fleet in the United States is implementing smart charging and aims to incorporate 
V2G in the future on the grounds that school buses are used at predetermined times and have 
long periods when they are idle.202 China has also released plans for the integration of EV 
charging infrastructure into the electricity grid; they include time-of-use electricity pricing and 
bidirectional charging stations.203

 — Data centers. Another source of flexible capacity could come from computer data centers, 

which account for a high, and growing, share of electricity consumption. In 2022, as much as 
450 terawatt-hours were attributed to data centers, including AI applications such as large 
language model training.204 By some estimates, this could more than double to more than 
1,000 terawatt-hours as soon as 2026.205 Using this demand to add flexibility to the grid could 
be crucial. Depending on the business model and application, some power-hungry computing 
operations, such as training large language models, could be executed with more flexibility. This 
is already happening among large players, for instance by shifting some nonurgent computing 
tasks to times when demand for power is lower.206 Another option is building new data centers 
in regions where more spare capacity is available; this would be contingent on overcoming 
technological constraints, for instance ensuring access to data network infrastructure and 
maintaining latency levels or delays in data transmission within acceptable levels. Large 
companies with a portfolio of locations could offer incentives to dynamically reallocate loads that 
are not critical between regions according to the needs of the grid.207

 — Industry. The growing electrification of the heat generation needed in industry also offers 

potential for new sources of demand-side flexibility. Several provinces in China have launched 
demand-side flexibility pilot programs focused on industry, with the goal of having a demand-
response capacity of 3 to 5 percent of annual peak load by 2025.208 Three main opportunities to 
enhance demand-side flexibility could play out, as follows:

•  Shifts in power consumption could be achieved by adjusting the timing of some industrial 

processes so that they can accommodate changes in production levels with proper notice. 

•  Some processes could use hybrid heating, switching between fossil-fuel and electric-powered 
boilers to adjust power demand for excess or scarcity in the power supply. In Europe, these two 
technologies together could create as much as 150 gigawatts of capacity by 2050.209

•  Supply-side flexibility technologies such as TES could help manage power demand from boilers 

and furnaces. Some of the heat produced could be stored in TES and then drawn on when 
needed. Europe has 8.5 gigawatt-hours of TES that is either operational or under construction. 
The opportunity for growth is significant. The global potential of TES by 2040 could range from 
800 to 4,800 gigawatt-hours.210 (See chapter 7 on the industry domain, for a discussion of 
using TES to increase the flexibility of industrial demand).

 — Hydrogen. Producing hydrogen via electrolysis is particularly energy-intensive and could account 
for as much as 20 percent of total final energy consumption in 2050, according to McKinsey’s 
2023 Achieved Commitments scenario (for more detail, see chapter 10 on the hydrogen 
domain).211 Electrolyzers can adjust energy consumption by reducing hydrogen production when 
power demand is at its peak and increasing production when there is excess VRE. This would 
create flexibility in two ways: demand for power from electrolyzers could adjust to the needs of 
the grid, and the hydrogen itself could be used as a fuel for generation—a supply-side lever.

These technologies vary in both the degree of flexibility they offer and the type of flexibility. For 
instance, VPPs controlling residential housing could provide a fast burst of additional capacity to 
the grid for a limited amount of time before consumers resume their energy use. Smart charging 
of EVs and V2G could be less available during peak commuting times but could provide off-peak 
power for longer durations courtesy of the large number of EVs that charge during work hours and 
overnight. Hybrid heating in industry could switch from electric boilers to gas power boilers for large 
periods of time to provide continuous flexibility, but this would require time to adjust production 
processes. Some data centers could provide large amounts of flexibility for sustained periods. A 
combination of these technologies would offer demand-side flexibility in size, availability, duration, 
and responsiveness. 

The power system would need to change to enable demand-side flexibility 
To fully unlock the potential of demand-side flexibility options would require the power system 
to change. Historically, grids were configured to send power to users one way, with some 
communication between the stages. But if “load shaping” is to work, demand and supply signals 
would need to be communicated between grid system operators and users in real time, and some 
bidirectionality in the power flow would need to be enabled. This would require hardware and 
software to manage and integrate the new assets into the system; behavioral changes, such as 
accepting the need to shift when consumers use energy-intensive assets such as EV charging 
and washing machines to different times of the day; implementing control measures to ensure the 
optimization and stability of the grid; and managing system security risks that could potentially 
increase as more assets can be controlled remotely. 

Hardware and digital grids would need to be upgraded.212 A smart grid is important for integrating 
distributed energy resources. McKinsey research finds that the grid would require smart 
meters, advanced transformers, controllers, and software systems for the grid to be sufficiently 
adaptable.213 Progress on smart meter installation varies around the world. The United States 
has achieved a penetration rate of approximately 80 percent, while coverage averages about 
60 percent in the EU and about 50 percent in the Asia–Pacific region, driven largely by national 
rollouts in China and Japan.214 However, in many geographies, including Africa, India, and Latin 
America, coverage is less than 10 percent.215 In addition to deploying hardware, software such 
as advanced distribution management systems can be used to monitor, control, and optimize 
the distribution of electricity, enhance the reliability, efficiency, and resilience of the grid, and 
complement upgrades in physical infrastructure.216

New assets would also need to be integrated. EVs and distributed energy resources would need to 
be incorporated into the grid and managed. This would require software such as VPP to be scaled 
up to manage and automate the demand response from distributed-energy-resource assets. 
The US Department of Energy estimates that VPP capacity could increase from 45 gigawatts to 
between 80 and 160 gigawatts, or the equivalent of supplying 10 to 20 percent of US peak power 
demand by 2030.217

There are some important nonphysical challenges, too. Among others, markets would need to be 
designed with the right price signals to encourage participation and change behavior among energy 
users, who would need to be willing to participate in such schemes.218

This is a Level 2 challenge. Many economies are already upgrading grids, increasing adoption 
of distributed-energy-resource assets, and building VPPs to create flexible capacity. However, 
the pace would need to accelerate, and a moderate degree of transformation would be required. 
Moreover, some—although not all—technologies that would be needed are still only in the early 
stages of their deployment. 

Challenge 4: Securing land for renewables (Level 2)
A larger power system, in particular one with a large share of VRE, would need more land, creating a 
physical challenge of managing different land uses. There are also pertinent nonphysical issues, such 
as pushback from communities that do not want land used for renewables and permitting delays that 
could limit the amount of land that is available for VRE. 

VRE has a different, often larger, land footprint than other energy sources but can share  
space with other uses 
Solar and wind energy are less energy-dense power sources, which means that they have a larger 
land footprint per unit of generated energy than other sources when considering indirect land use—
that is, land that is directly covered by a power source as well as land used indirectly to ensure that 
there is appropriate space between assets as well as upstream extraction of materials. 

On average, total land use (including indirect use) per unit of electricity of onshore wind is about 
100 square meters per megawatt-hour per year. Utility solar projects use about 20 for silicon-based 
panels, while cadmium-based ones use about 13. The precise amount of land needed varies widely 
depending on the location and the materials used. In the case of solar projects installed on the 
ground, the range is 10 to 30. For comparison, coal plants use about 15 square meters per megawatt-
hour per year (also with a large range, and mostly arising from land use of upstream coal mining), and 
nuclear power uses 0.3 square meter per megawatt-hour per year.219

The situation is nuanced, however. Unlike other energy sources, some of the land that renewables 
need can often be managed with other uses. Wind farms have a large footprint in indirect land use 
to ensure sufficient spacing between turbines—and that land can be used in other ways. Their direct 
land use is relatively small at about 0.4 square meter per megawatt-hour.220 Solar panels mounted on 
roofs effectively have no direct land use, and only about one to three square meters per megawatt-
hour of indirect use, mostly from the mining of the minerals needed. In short, the specific ways VRE is 
deployed greatly influence how much land is required.

Overall, VRE needs a limited amount of all available global land, but there may be bottlenecks 
Taking both direct and indirect land into consideration, most net-zero scenarios project that VRE 
would use less than 1 percent of global land by 2050. This would be roughly double the share 
currently used by fossil-fuel energy sources.221 Accounting for natural restrictions, such as areas 
that are regularly flooded, and artificial structures, like urban areas, the figure is 2.5 percent of 
available land.222

This may seem a small share of land, but in many economies there are restrictions on where VRE 
can be deployed that could still produce bottlenecks—often related more to social acceptance and 
regulations than to technical feasibility—especially in economies with higher population density or 
poorer endowments of renewables. This is the case in some parts of Europe, Japan, and South Korea, 
for instance. In Germany, less than 20 percent of total land is available for onshore wind. Technical 
constraints, including, for instance, steep slopes that are unsuitable for VRE and environmentally 
protected areas, are part of the story, applying to about 6 percent of all available land. But an even 
larger factor is regulation that prevents VRE from being too close to where people live. This rules 
out 60 percent of land that would otherwise be available.223 As a consequence, as much as 50 to 
80 percent of technically available land could be needed to reach Germany’s deployment targets.224 
In Italy, only about 1 percent of land is technically available for utility solar projects, and as a result 
almost all of it would be required. As much as 60 to 85 percent of that would be needed to meet 
renewable-energy source targets.225

Land constraints for VRE can be unlocked in a number of ways 
There are a number of ways to minimize the amount of land VRE uses. One option is to choose 
potential multiuse sites, such as placing solar panels on rooftops or over canals, or combining 
onshore wind or solar with agriculture. In Europe, two-thirds of solar capacity added since 2020 has 
been on rooftops.226 In Europe and the United States, farmers are sharing their cropland with wind 
farms. Economies that have limited technically available land could build interconnections to bring 
renewable power generated from other economies. Another option is co-locating solar and wind 
power, which can boost the project’s energy density by using the indirect land that wind needs, but 
this would depend on favorable operating conditions. Innovation could also help. If the efficiency of 
VRE continues to improve—from 2010 to 2022, solar efficiency increased 1.5 times—the amount of 
land needed would decline.227 Finally, the amount of land available would rise if regulations across 
regions were harmonized in a way that reconsiders limitations on the development of renewable 
energy supply near settlements.228

§ § §

This is a Level 2 challenge. The amount of land devoted to VRE would need to expand at a rapid pace 
to match accelerating deployment. To address this challenge, a combination of options could be 
needed. They include nonphysical aspects, such as regulatory restrictions on deployment, but also 
innovation and transformation of how VRE is deployed, including, for instance, improving the energy 
efficiency of VRE and co-locating solar and wind to mitigate the amount of land required. 

In Europe, two-thirds of solar 
capacity added since 2020 
has been on rooftops.

Challenge 5

Challenge 5: Connecting through grid expansion (Level 2)
The electricity grid is the cornerstone of the power system, and the ability to expand it to cope with 
rising electrification could dictate not only whether the power system can be transformed but the 
success of the entire energy transition. 

Energy grids are massive. In the United States alone, transmission and distribution lines stretch the 
equivalent of the distance to the moon and back more than ten times.229 During the energy transition, 
a high degree of transformation would be needed. These behemoths would need to be expanded, 
replaced, and transformed faster than is occurring today.

Grids would need to undergo a multifaceted transformation 
As part of the energy transition, grids would need to be transformed in four main ways. 

 — Larger. Global power capacity could grow about fivefold by 2050 to absorb new technologies 

such as VRE—running at relatively low utilization rates—and meet increased demand for power 
from new use cases, including EVs and heat pumps.230 This growth would be in the form of longer 
power lines as well as larger capacity, such as bigger transformers. 

 — More distributed. The makeup of the power system would change with more, but smaller, assets. 
For example, new utility solar fields have about one-quarter of the generation capacity of coal

plants; more sites would therefore be needed with a greater number of transmission lines to 
connect to the grid.231

 — More dispersed. Some VRE, such as offshore wind, is further from population centers and 

therefore would require longer transmission routes.232

 — More regionally interconnected. Because of the need for more flexibility to be built into the power 
system, more interconnections among different economies and regions would be needed, and 
this would require additional transmission lines. 

The size of the grid may need to double or quadruple and to scale faster than it is today 
Over the past decade, global electricity grids have grown by about one-quarter at a pace of about 
2 percent per year, from just over 60 million to just under 80 million kilometers.233 Advanced 
economies and China, in particular, have accelerated grid expansion, but the pace needs to be even 
faster in the future in order to keep up with the needs of the transition and expanding access to 
energy.234 Projections for the required scale-up by 2050 vary widely, but all agree on the need for this 
to happen quickly. Estimates forecast a two- to threefold increase in the length of the global grid by 
2050.235 The International Energy Agency, for instance, projects that the volume of transmission and 
distribution lines would need to almost triple, or grow by more than 3 percent per year. That implies 
accelerated deployment at a pace that is 40 to 50 percent faster than over the past ten years.236

In emerging markets where access to power is still far from universal and where economies are 
posting relatively robust growth, the grid would need to grow especially fast. Overall, 80 percent 
of gross global additions between now and 2050 are expected to be in emerging markets and 
developing economies.237 At the same time, a large part of the existing grid also needs to be replaced. 
In the United States, it is estimated that 70 percent of transmission lines are over 25 years old and 
would need to be replaced within ten to 20 years.238

Increasing the size of the grid is only part of the story—it would also need to be smarter to coordinate 
the various parts of the system and optimize for reliability, flexibility, resilience, and stability. This 
might include monitoring real-time information to support the matching of supply and demand as 
VRE introduces more variability and intermittency. It would also include supporting the coordination 
of distributed energy resources and facilitating demand-side flexibility strategies, such as time-of-
use pricing. 

The required pace of expansion and replacement would be testing. Lead times for the permitting 
and construction of transmission lines in mature markets such as the EU and the United States 
have tended to be between five and 15 years, compared with one to seven years to build renewable 
assets.239 Among the reasons for extended lead times are issues about where to site plants and 
operations and, in particular, lack of social acceptance and limited access to rights-of-way.240 In 
other economies, such as China and India, lead times have tended to be shorter, at about two to six 
years. Important components of the grid could face shortages due to manufacturing bottlenecks. 
For instance, many newer, larger transformers would be required, and their production has faced 
constraints.241

Various measures would help address issues about grid expansion but would require a  
large transformation 
More ambitious grid plans and approaches that accelerate the ability to deploy them would be 
needed for a successful energy transition. The United States is one of many countries that are 
putting in place targets to ensure that grid expansion and replacement both happen. The US 
Department of Energy has launched a Building a Better Grid initiative with the aim of accelerating 
the deployment of transmission in high-priority areas. One of the key features of this plan is a more 
streamlined permitting process. It is also considering modernization of the grid, with $20 billion 
allocated to states and utilities to be split equally between grid expansion and resilience.242 Additional 
interconnections are also required. The EU is proposing new legislation focused on grid expansion 
and digitalization to connect VRE, and the European Network of Transmission System Operators 
for Electricity is coordinating the expansion of interconnections on a smart grid across 39 European

transmission system operators.243 In China, the National Development and Reform Commission has 
announced plans to establish a unified national power market by 2030, merging six regional grids 
into a single electricity market.244 In 2022, China invested $166 billion in its transmission grid, more 
than all other countries put together at $118 billion.245

§ § §

This is a Level 2 challenge—and one that is vital because many other physical challenges across 
domains, directly or indirectly, would rely on it being addressed. The grid would need to expand 
significantly and faster even while modernizing, which would require a large degree of transformation. 
Several countries have put in place targets for grid expansion, but reaching the required pace of 
deployment would require new measures, notably permitting changes. 

Challenge 6: Navigating nuclear and other clean firm energy (Level 2) 
Clean firm power sources, such as nuclear, hydro, and thermal assets with carbon capture, could be 
crucial pieces of a decarbonized power system. They combine low emissions with the ability to be 
called upon when needed and can therefore help to reduce the variability of the power system. They 
often have lower (or different) constraints on inputs, needing fewer critical minerals and less land than 
VRE, and their infrastructure needs are also different from VRE. Moreover, some types of clean firm 
power, including nuclear fission, have already demonstrated their potential to scale up rapidly and 
serve as a significant source of power.246

Several options exist, and a mix of technologies could be pursued. Overall, the pace of transformation 
in deploying these options would need to accelerate. For all their benefits, clean firm power sources 
face two main hurdles. First, many of them are nascent. For example, small modular reactors, carbon 
capture, or even much more nascent nuclear fusion still have meaningful technological uncertainty. 
Second, even mature technologies, such as large-scale nuclear fission and hydropower, face 
deployment constraints. In the case of the former, for example, a number of physical hurdles related 
to large and complex engineering projects would need to be addressed.

Clean firm power can help reduce power system variability 
Expanding the different sources of clean firm power would help to address the other physical 
challenges in the power domain (see Sidebar 4, “Different types of clean firm power”). A combination 
of clean firm power and VRE could enable a power system that is less variable and reduce the need 
to build an oversize system.247 One study found that, in California, every megawatt of clean firm power 
installed could reduce new VRE capacity needed by ten megawatts even while cutting the degree of 
variability.248 This would especially help emerging power systems that do not have existing thermal 
generation assets that can support the provision of firm power, as discussed in Challenge 2, to grow 
while adopting VRE.

Between 1970 and 1995, the 
share of nuclear fission in total 
power generation globally 
increased from 2 to 18 percent.

Sidebar 4. Different types of 
clean firm power

Most net-zero scenarios assume rapid scale-
up of clean firm power sources, although 
estimates vary widely. In McKinsey’s 2023 
Achieved Commitments scenario, for 
example, total clean firm power would scale 
by 2.5 times between 2022 and 2050, from 
about 1,800 gigawatts to 4,500 gigawatts. 

Clean firm power capacity could come from 
a number of sources. While promising, each 
faces numerous physical barriers, ranging 
from technological immaturity to competition 
for inputs, that would need to be overcome.

Biomass. Burning organic matter from plants 
and animals creates heat that can be used 
to make steam to generate electricity, which 
can offer a low-emissions source of power.1 
The largest physical challenge is ensuring 
that sufficient land is available to grow 
feedstock in the face of competing demand, 
such as from agriculture to grow food. There 
is competition, too, for the biomass itself, 
often from sectors whose emissions are 
hard to abate. Biomass could be turned 
into sustainable fuels in sectors such as 
aviation and cement (as a source of heat) and 
even used as a feedstock for plastics. One 
positive is that not all biomass requires land 
where there are competing demands. The 
EU, for instance, is updating regulation to 
promote the use of advanced biofuels mainly 
produced from waste and residue instead of 
conventional biomass.2

Fossil-based generation with CCUS. Gas 
power plants could be paired with carbon 

capture, use, and storage (CCUS) to capture 
emissions. This would require solving the 
physical challenge of natural gas fumes 
having low concentrations of CO2, which 
makes it harder to capture (see Challenge 24 
on capturing point-source carbon). However, 
as innovation proceeds with technologies 
such as oxyfuel precombustion and 
adsorption capture, and as gas systems 
improve, gas with CCUS could play a role in 
providing clean firm capacity.3 Of course, 
upstream emissions related to extraction of 
natural gas would also need to be abated.

Geothermal. Conventionally, hot water or 
steam is piped to the surface to generate 
electricity or heat, usually by turning turbines. 
The key challenge is the dependency on 
naturally occurring underground reservoirs 
of hot water or steam and the permeability 
of surrounding rock formations so that fluids 
can flow through at relatively high rates. 
These conditions tend to exist in specific 
locations, such as areas with high levels 
of volcanic or tectonic activity. This issue 
could be overcome by building enhanced 
geothermal systems, artificial geothermal 
reservoirs in areas that have thermal 
energy but lack adequate permeability, 
water, or both, and by pumping subsurface 
water using techniques similar to hydraulic 
fracturing, as in oil and gas extraction. Today, 
this technology is in the early stages of 
development, but progress is rapid.4

Hydrogen and other low-emissions fuels. 
Traditional gas turbines can be converted to 
use hydrogen as fuel, which can be burned 
without emitting CO2 (see chapter 10 on the 
hydrogen and energy carriers domain). 

Hydropower. Hydropower is mature and 
economical, but its supply can be limited by 
reduced rainfall or drought.5 The EU and the 
United States have few remaining sites, and 
there are some environmental and social 
concerns.6 But according to McKinsey’s 
2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, in 
some economies in Africa and Asia, capacity 
could grow 2.3 times by 2050, compared 
with 1.1 times elsewhere. 

Nuclear fission. Heat from splitting an  
atom is used to make steam that spins 
turbines to produce electricity (see the 
following discussion). 

Nuclear fusion. When two atomic nuclei are 
fused, huge amounts of energy are released, 
producing heat for steam used to generate 
power. Were fusion to be achieved at scale, 
it could produce firm, low-emissions energy 
without creating long-lived nuclear waste 
from spent fuel. Deploying fusion as a 
meaningful part of the energy transition has 
been nearly impossible for decades, and the 
future is highly uncertain. Thus far, fusion 
machines consume more energy than they 
create. Moreover, the equipment needed is 
tremendously complex, including the world’s 
most advanced magnets, materials that can 
withstand the intense temperatures on the 
machine’s inside wall that are hard to make, 
and submillimeter precision for machined 
parts several meters across. Many notable 
advances in fusion have been achieved 
and private investment in it has surged, but 
substantial uncertainty remains about both 
feasibility and timelines.7

 Burning biomass releases CO2 that had been taken out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis and therefore does not lead to a net addition of CO2 as would be the case when 
fossil fuels are burned.

 For example, hydroelectric dams and their reservoirs can generate substantial amounts of greenhouse gases, notably methane, as organic matter that is flooded and, when 
submerged, decomposes. However, in general, hydropower emissions tend to be lower than for fossil-fuel-based power, and there are a number of measures that could reduce 
emissions that relate, for instance, to water level and vegetation management. See, for example, Ilissa B. Ocko and Steven P. Hamburg, “Climate impacts of hydropower: Enormous

Another advantage of clean firm power is that it needs less land than solar or wind. For example, 
nuclear and gas with carbon capture would need less than 1 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of 
the land required to produce the same amount of power as VRE, considering indirect land use.249 The 
extent to which grids would need to scale could also be reduced with clean firm power, which would 
be less modular and, for some sources, less constrained to specific locations and therefore closer to 
population centers.250

Also beneficial is the fact that many forms of clean firm power have lower critical minerals intensity 
than VRE. Nuclear, for instance, needs five tonnes of critical minerals per megawatt, compared with 
seven in the case of solar and ten in the case of onshore wind.251 Of course, clean firm technologies 
have their own input requirements in the form of fuels. Nuclear needs uranium, while biomass or fossil 
fuels are required for other clean firm thermal-based power plants.

Nuclear fission is a mature technology that can provide additional clean firm capacity but  
faces some hurdles 
Of the various clean firm sources of power, large-scale nuclear fission combines both technological 
maturity and concrete commitments from many economies to scale deployment further. At COP28 in 
2023, a group of economies announced commitments to triple capacity by 2050.252 This section takes a 
closer look at the physical challenges associated with expanding the deployment of nuclear power. 

Nuclear fission has already demonstrated its potential to be a significant source of firm clean power. 
Between 1970 and 1995, nuclear energy’s share of total power generation globally increased from 2 to 
18 percent, the largest rise in share of any clean power source.253 Deployment peaked at 23 gigawatts a 
year between 1981 and 1990 before declining to about six gigawatts a year from 2011 to 2022.254 In this 
period, the geographic mix also changed. While some advanced economies made material additions to 
capacity—South Korea by 25 percent—85 percent of additions to nuclear capacity between 2011 and 
2020 was in emerging and developing economies. Of these, China stands out with a fourfold increase 
in capacity, and Russia with 25 percent. The United Arab Emirates connected its first reactor in 2020.255

However, nuclear expansion would require overcoming a range of physical barriers, including  
the following: 

 — Complex engineering and design. Engineering plans are often unique to each site, and project 

teams can choose from as many as 20 different reactor models. Because projects are so 
different, there are fewer learning opportunities for improving the next one. 

 — Inefficient planning and construction. Because they have tended to be bespoke, new nuclear 
projects—especially in the United States and Western Europe—have faced planning and 
construction challenges. Without a consistent pipeline of standardized nuclear projects, it is 
difficult to pass on expertise and lessons to the next project.

 — Nuclear waste. Currently, the amount of nuclear waste generated is relatively small. In the United 
States, which is the largest nuclear energy producer in the world, waste each year amounts to less 
than half the volume of an Olympic-size swimming pool.256 Nonetheless, spent fuel rods that have 
been removed from the reactor core remain highly radioactive and continue to generate large 
amounts of heat for decades, and they therefore need to be managed. Some countries, including 
France, reprocess nuclear fuel, and advances in reactors could increase reuse.257 However, 
storage options would also be needed. In the near term, spent nuclear fuel is usually stored 
on-site at nuclear power plants in cooling pools and dry cask storage systems. In the United 
States, for instance, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses dry cask storage systems for 
40 years and allows license renewals for 40 additional years.258 Over the long run, solutions such 
as deep-geological waste storage facilities would be required. Finland started construction in 
2016 on the world’s first site, which is expected to begin operations in the mid-2020s.259

 — Shortage of labor for construction and operations and maintenance. McKinsey estimates that 
the nuclear industry employs about 600,000 people in Canada and the United States, and in

these two economies alone, this would need to increase to one million to support an increase in 
capacity to 50 gigawatts a year.260

 — Siting requirements. Finding the right location for a nuclear plant depends on a range of physical 
factors such as access to the grid, the presence of cooling water, safety and navigating public 
misgivings about safety, nuclear waste disposal, and proliferation.261

 — Specialized supply chain. Nuclear has a limited and fragmented supply chain for components, 
with stringent standards for many parts of different designs. A brand-new supply chain would 
need to be developed to support more standard and modular designs.262 Furthermore, the supply 
of uranium, the key input, would need to be secured. 

These physical barriers have often contributed to the construction delays and cost overruns frequently 
associated with new nuclear projects. Addressing them could make nuclear power more competitive.263

Economies that are scaling nuclear have found ways to overcome key challenges
As of early 2024, about 35 economies had nuclear power plants that were active or under construction.264

Asian economies account for 50 percent of current nuclear capacity being constructed.265 They have 
demonstrated how to overcome some key challenges. For instance, they have opted for standardization 
and back-to-back builds. Between 1989 and 2005, South Korea constructed 12 reactors in quick 
succession, eight of which were the same model (OPR-1000).266 The average construction period was 
56 months, more than three times faster than the historical average period in other economies. This 
repeat build in a short time frame increased the pace of learning across projects while developing a 
robust and skilled labor force and supply chain. Construction delays in China and other East Asian 
economies have been two to three years, compared with four years in Europe and six in the United 
States, where some recent projects have been delayed by as much as eight years.267

Technology could also play a role in overcoming physical challenges. Smaller-scale Gen-III+ reactors 
that are modularized could be ready by 2030. These reactors could reduce construction time to three to 
four years from more than six in the case of Gen-III a. Gen-IV are more fuel-efficient reactors that could 
be ready after 2030, with the potential to be built in less than four years.268 In addition, innovation in 
ways to process spent fuel into a source of fuel could alleviate concerns about nuclear waste.269

§ § §

This is a Level 2 challenge. Expanding clean firm power capacity would require an acceleration in 
the pace of deployment of nuclear, among other sources. In the case of nascent technologies, such 
as enhanced geothermal, the lack of maturity creates uncertainty about the technological pathway 
ahead. These technologies would need continued innovation to attain their required performance  
and scale up. In the case of more mature technologies, such as nuclear, the scale of transformation  
required, combined with input and infrastructure requirements, is the key issue. There are proven 
ways to scale these technologies—more quickly, for example, through standardization of nuclear 
designs and back-to-back plant builds—but more effort would be required to do so. 

Asian economies account for 
50 percent of current nuclear 
capacity being constructed.

Note: This research examines 25 significant physical challenges in seven domains at the core of the energy transition, categorized in three levels. 
Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require the deployment of 
known technologies to accelerate, and associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological 
performance (often with demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning. The focus is on physical realities because 
they influence the ability to design an interdependent system that has performance comparable to that of the current system and to reduce emissions feasibly. 
These factors influence cost and affordability. Nonphysical factors—notably cost—are important but are not the focus of this research. Assessment of required 
deployment of technologies primarily draws on McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, which assumes that countries that have committed to net zero 
(some by 2050, some later) meet those commitments, and in which warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. This scenario is used because it 
provides sufficient regional and sectoral granularity for assessing required deployment. In some instances, this research also uses scenarios from other sources for 
reasons of data availability.

Mobility accounts for about 21 percent of the global CO2 emissions in the energy system, with 
road mobility representing the bulk of these, at about 17 percent.270 The remaining 4 percent 
comes primarily from aviation and shipping. While there are significant physical challenges with 
decarbonizing aviation and shipping, we focus here on the challenges associated with decarbonizing 
road mobility, given its large contribution to emissions (see Challenge 11 in chapter 2 for a brief 
discussion of the physical challenge associated with decarbonizing aviation and shipping).

Driving from place to place is an integral part of our daily lives—for work, shopping, meeting friends 
and family, recreation, and moving goods from place to place. The large share of road mobility in 
global emissions reflects the enormous fleet of 1.5 billion internal-combustion engine vehicles, 
or ICEs, on the road today. These vehicles collectively drive nearly 15 trillion kilometers a year.271 
Passenger cars account for about 85 percent of vehicles on the road and about half of emissions 
from road mobility.272 The remaining share of emissions comes from light commercial vehicles, trucks, 
and buses, with a small portion made up of emissions from two- and three-wheelers.273 These various 
types of vehicles are used in very different ways, and those uses vary by region, from long commutes 
from the suburbs to the cities in the United States, to zipping through the crowded streets in Delhi, to 
hauling tonnes of cargo across entire countries.

In these use cases, the vast majority of vehicles on the road today are powered by fossil fuels. These 
fuels offer many advantages: they have high energy density, are fast to refuel, and are relatively easy 
to transport and store. But vehicles powered by fossil fuels are relatively energy inefficient. Even 
best-in-class ICE vehicles in the United States convert only about 15 to 30 percent of the energy 
stored in gasoline to useful work at the wheels.274 They also emit a great deal of CO2. 

The energy transition in road mobility would require shifting the vast stock of ICE-based vehicles on 
the road toward lower-emissions options that use both demonstrated and evolving technologies. 

Two notable solutions are battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) 
powered by hydrogen.275 Over the past decade, sales of BEVs, in particular, have experienced rapid 
growth. More recently, momentum has slowed in some regions. For example, in the United States, 
BEV sales increased by around 40 percent in 2023, but this was slower than in the previous two 
years. In the first quarter of 2024, sales rose by about 3 percent year over year, again, below the 
previous two years.276 

There would need to be a large scale-up of BEVs and FCEVs under the energy transition. In 
McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, about 270 million of these vehicles (all types) 
would be needed on the road by 2030, and about one billion by 2050.277 Current deployment of EVs 
is only 3 percent of what would be required by 2050. In this scenario, sales of low-emissions vehicles 
would surge from more than 15 percent of new vehicles today to more than 75 percent in 2030 and 
to almost 100 percent by 2050. In some segments, the increase in sales of low-emissions vehicles 
relative to today’s levels would likely be especially large. For instance, there are very few electric 
medium- and heavy-duty trucks on the road today, but by 2050 there could be more than 40 million—
about 65 percent of all medium- and heavy-duty trucks operating in that year.278

Besides driving down emissions, the electrification of mobility could unlock efficiency gains. For example, 
BEVs can convert more than 80 percent of the energy in the batteries to useful work at the wheels.279

Advances are being made, and investment in critical EV infrastructure and supply chains that would 
be required is accelerating, though more in some regions than others. China already has more public 
EV-charging points than the rest of the world put together and is expected to account for 50 percent 
of worldwide battery capacity additions in the period to 2030.280

But physical challenges remain. Four physical challenges need to be addressed to ensure the 
decarbonization of road mobility: (1) driving BEVs beyond breakeven; (2) going the distance on BEV 
range; (3) loading up electric trucks; and (4) charging up EVs. 

The first two challenges, relating to passenger EVs, are categorized as Level 1 physical challenges, defined 
as requiring progress in deploying established technologies and facing the least hurdles. Scaling the 
infrastructure and supply chains required to support EVs is a Level 2 challenge: accelerated progress 
and a relatively high degree of transformation are needed. Road mobility also has a Level 3 challenge: 
the use case is hard and the transformation is just beginning. In trucking, current battery density is not 
high enough to support all use cases of vehicles with large payloads traveling over long distances—an 
example of a property gap colliding with a difficult use case. At the same time, scaling FCEVs for trucking is 
dependent on the build-out of the hydrogen supply chain and the hydrogen-refueling infrastructure.

This report focuses on decarbonization relating to the adoption of EVs, because this is expected to 
be the main lever for reducing emissions, and there are large physical challenges in this area. This 
research does not explore in detail other ways to decarbonize road mobility that either are based 
on improvements in energy efficiency, including improvements in existing fossil fuel technologies, 
such as ICE engines (covered in Challenge 23), or entail behavioral changes, including modal 
shifts related to new or existing technologies (see Sidebar 5, “Modal shifts can support the 
decarbonization of mobility”).

Similarly, we do not explore in detail hybrid-vehicle technologies that combine an internal-combustion 
engine with an electric propulsion system. But hybrids, too, may play some role in the decarbonization 
of road mobility (see Sidebar 6, “Hybrids can also support the decarbonization of mobility”). 

The first two challenges, relating 
to passenger EVs, are categorized 
as Level 1 physical challenges.

Sidebar 5. Modal shifts can  
support the decarbonization  
of mobility

A mobility decarbonization measure 
being considered is to shift not only the 
power train of the vehicles in which people 
travel (from ICE to electric) but also their 
very mode of travel. Mobility could be 
transformed if there were a significant shift 
in the use of private cars in urban areas to 
other, lower-emissions and higher-utilization 
modes of travel (Exhibit 23). Globally, on 
average, about 45 percent of passenger-
kilometers traveled today are by private 
car.1 However, previous McKinsey analysis 
suggests that—given regional trends and 
shifting consumer preferences for travel, 
and assuming that the appropriate alternate 
modes of transportation are developed—

this share could fall to 29 percent by 
2035 under McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved 
Commitments scenario.2

Part of the shift in this scenario would be 
toward existing technologies, including 
public transportation, shared mobility, and 
micromobility (for example, motorcycles, 
e-bikes, and e-scooters). All would entail 
large shifts in how people travel, and that, 
in turn, would require behavior to change 
and the development of associated 
infrastructure, such as building new modes 
of public transportation and carving out more 
bike lanes in cities.

New technologies that are anticipated  
to come on the market in coming years  
could also make it easier to shift how people 
travel. Autonomous vehicles could be on 
the market at scale by 2030, with a range 
of applications. For example, robo-shuttles 
(shared autonomous minibuses with four to 

ten seats) could pool travelers.3 Mobility-as-a-
service applications could make mixed-mode 
traveling easier, for example by creating an 
itinerary for public transportation, shared 
mobility services, and parking lot services 
in one app that requires a single payment.4 
Again, all of this would require continued 
innovation in new technologies and the build-
out of appropriate infrastructure. 

Other modal shifts could also play a role in 
decarbonizing mobility more broadly. Shifting 
freight transportation from trucks and planes 
to lower-emissions options such as rail or 
ships is being considered to reduce emissions 
from freight transportation. Of course, this 
would also involve developing new routes and 
building associated infrastructure.

In summary, while there may be potential to 
reduce emissions by shifting how people 
travel, there would still be physical challenges 
to overcome.

Sidebar 6. Hybrids can also  
support the decarbonization  
of mobility

Hybrid vehicles may also play an important 
role in the decarbonization of road mobility. 
The following are the four main types of 
hybrid vehicles:

1. Mild hybrids (MHEVs). These are the entry 
point to electric powertrain technologies. A 
low-voltage system (mostly 48 volts) enables the 
use of efficient electrification elements, such 
as start-stop, regenerative braking, and some 
level of power assist. MHEVs typically use a 
relatively small battery pack, primarily charged 
through regenerative braking and excess power 
generated by the ICE. They usually do not have 
an exclusive electric-only mode of propulsion.

2. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). These 
are designed to optimize the use of the ICE 
through an interplay with a small low-range 
electric powertrain for low-speed cruising or 
a power boost. HEVs are similar to MHEVs in 
battery size and how the battery is charged.

3. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). 
These have an architecture similar to that 
of HEVs but a significantly larger battery. 
Notably, however, that battery is still only 
about one-fifth the size of a BEV battery. 
PHEVs also have a more powerful electric 
engine and can be recharged by plugging 
into an external source of power. They are 
designed for a significant share of pure 
electric driving and typically offer a range of 
around 80 kilometers. In some regions, such 
as China, where PHEV batteries tend to be 
larger, some vehicles can achieve ranges of up 
to 100 kilometers.1

4. Other hybrids. Other new types of hybrids 
include range-extended EVs (REEVs), which 
combine a battery with an auxiliary power unit 
to extend the driving range. This is typically 
a small ICE that functions as a generator to 
produce electricity, although in the future the 
same role could be played by a fuel cell. When 
the battery’s charge is low, the ICE activates, 
recharges the battery, and extends the 
vehicle’s range. Unlike other types of hybrids, 
REEVs draw most of their power from the 
battery rather than the ICE engine.

The role of hybrids in the energy transition 
is debated. They still generate tailpipe 
emissions and carry the risk that not enough 
decarbonization is achieved to align with 
global decarbonization goals, or that they 
are not achieved quickly enough. But hybrids 
can be used as a bridging solution on the 
path to the widespread adoption of full EVs. 
Over the course of their lifetimes, hybrids are 
generally expected to produce emissions 
that fall between those of ICE vehicles and 
BEVs (considering all sources of emissions, 
including manufacturing and running the 
vehicles). For example, the IEA estimates 
that a medium-sized PHEV in the United 
States could produce about 55 tonnes of 
CO2-equivalent emissions over its life cycle, 
approximately the midpoint between the 
emissions of a comparable ICE (75 tonnes) 
and a BEV (27 tonnes).2 Of course, these 
values vary significantly, depending on a 
range of factors, which are explored in the 
next section. 

Moreover, in the short to medium term, 
hybrids may help address some of the 
challenges associated with BEVs explored in 
this chapter. Hybrids may disrupt consumer 

lifestyles less and therefore encourage 
consumers to switch away from ICEs. For 
example, hybrid vehicles, particularly PHEVs, 
combine the benefits of electric propulsion 
with the extended driving range provided 
by ICEs, potentially alleviating consumer 
concerns about current limits on BEV range. 
They may still provide an emissions benefit 
relative to ICEs by enabling drivers to depend 
on battery power for frequent short journeys 
and to utilize the power of the combustion 
engine on longer journeys. Hybrids can 
leverage the existing infrastructure for 
gasoline refueling—a particularly important 
feature while BEV charging infrastructure 
is limited. In 2024, the McKinsey Mobility 
Consumer Pulse surveyed more than 
35,000 people worldwide who regularly use 
mobility. The survey revealed that among 
respondents not considering switching 
to EVs, the top reasons cited were high 
cost of ownership (45 percent), charging 
concerns (33 percent), and range concerns 
(29 percent). About the same percentage 
of respondents who do not currently own 
an EV are considering buying a PHEV and a 
BEV as their next vehicle (18 and 20 percent, 
respectively).3

Many proponents of hybrids point out that 
demand for the critical minerals needed for 
full EVs—such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and 
graphite—is likely to exceed supply in the 
short to medium term (see chapter 9 on the 
raw-materials domain) and that the volume 
of minerals used in a single BEV could power 
several PHEVs. A single BEV may have lower 
lifetime emissions than a single hybrid vehicle, 
but there is potential for the broader adoption 
of hybrids, so using them could achieve 
greater overall emissions reductions.4

Challenge 7: Driving BEVs beyond breakeven (Level 1)
ICE passenger vehicles today account for substantial emissions. Burning a single liter of gasoline 
can lead to tailpipe emissions of more than two kilograms of CO2.281 BEV alternatives have no direct 
tailpipe emissions but still emit CO2 over their lifetimes. Ensuring that the technology and power 
systems underpinning BEVs have lower emissions over their lifetimes than ICEs would be vital if the 
new road mobility system is to deliver on emissions reduction goals.282

Emissions from BEVs and ICE vehicles include those generated during their production 
(manufacturing emissions) and those produced to power the vehicles over their lifetimes (running 
emissions). For ICEs, running emissions include well-to-wheel emissions associated with the 
production and burning of fossil fuels. For BEVs, running emissions include indirect emissions 
associated with the production of the electricity they use, including any upstream emissions 
associated with the production of the technologies or fuels that are used to generate power.283

Although BEVs have higher manufacturing emissions than ICEs, they have lower running emissions 
per kilometer when they are driven. BEVs thus start their lives with a larger emissions footprint, but 
then the more they are driven, the lower their total emissions relative to ICEs. If BEVs are driven far 
enough during their lifetimes, they reach a carbon breakeven point, at which their total emissions—
both manufacturing and running—fall below those of comparable ICEs. Beyond this point, BEVs 
achieve carbon savings relative to ICEs, with lower total lifetime emissions. The core physical 
challenges here are to ensure that the breakeven point occurs at as short a distance as possible  
and that the lifetime emissions of BEVs are far lower than those of ICE vehicles.

Three key factors determine BEVs’ carbon breakeven point and carbon savings
The carbon breakeven point and overall carbon savings of a BEV passenger vehicle are determined 
by three key factors: manufacturing emissions; running emissions (that is, emissions per kilometer 
driven); and total lifetime distance traveled—all in comparison with similar ICE vehicles.

Consider how these factors may play out for illustrative grids with relatively higher and lower 
emissions intensities (Exhibit 24)284:

Although BEVs have higher 
manufacturing emissions than 
ICEs, they have lower running 
emissions per kilometer 
when they are driven.

Manufacturing emissions (starting 
point before the car is driven) are 
higher for BEVs than for ICE vehicles, 
mostly due to emissions associated 
with battery manufacturing. These 
may fall over time

Running emissions are generally 
lower for BEVs than ICE vehicles; 
therefore, their trajectories intersect 
and BEVs achieve carbon breakeven 
against ICE vehicles

In more emissions-intensive grids, 
carbon breakeven is reached later in 
a vehicle’s lifetime

Comparing against top emissions-
performing ICE vehicles instead of 
average ones similarly delays carbon 
breakeven (if it is reached at all)

Decarbonization of today’s grids 
throughout a vehicle’s lifetime 
could lead to earlier breakeven

Beyond breakeven, carbon savings 
are accrued as the vehicle covers

 — Manufacturing emissions. BEVs have higher manufacturing emissions than ICEs, largely due 

to the emissions intensity of battery manufacturing. During their manufacture, passenger BEVs 
generate approximately eight to 12 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per vehicle—up to double the 
up-front emissions of passenger ICE vehicles. This difference is illustrated in the left-hand panel 
of Exhibit 24 by the vertical intercepts of the BEV and ICE emissions trajectories (point 1).285 

On average, about half of the manufacturing emissions associated with BEVs come from battery 
manufacturing and the balance from other components, such as energy use tied to manufacturing 
the vehicles and upstream processing of metals or components.286 The exact emissions from 
battery manufacturing vary depending on several factors, including the battery capacity, battery 
type, specific materials used, where those materials are sourced, and the mining practices involved. 
(And, of course, these emissions may fall over time).

 — Running emissions. BEVs have lower running emissions than ICE vehicles. For example, BEVs 

running on a US grid typically have 35 to 50 percent lower running emissions per kilometer than 
even a top-performing ICE vehicle.287 In Exhibit 24, the slopes of the vehicle emissions trajectories 
capture their running emissions. The BEV trajectories are flatter than those of ICEs because the 
addition to lifetime emissions is smaller per additional kilometer driven.

The exact difference in running emissions between BEVs and ICEs depends on how clean or 
dirty the power grid is where the BEV is driven, as well as the efficiency of the vehicles being 
considered (influenced by factors such as their size and weight).288 In Exhibit 24, the grid 
powering the BEV in the left-hand panel is about half as emissions intensive as the grid in the 
right-hand panel.289 The cleaner the grid, the flatter the BEV trajectory. For the lower-emissions 
grid, the BEV carbon breakeven point against an average ICE—where the emissions trajectories 
intersect—is reached relatively quickly, at about 25,000 kilometers (point 2). Under the higher-
emissions grid, breakeven is reached at about 45,000 kilometers (point 3).

The BEV carbon breakeven point also depends on the efficiency of the ICE vehicle the BEV 
displaces. An ICE vehicle with top mileage performance may produce running emissions about 
40 percent lower than those of an average-performing one.290 In the example considered in 
the right-hand panel of Exhibit 24, the combination of a more emissions-intensive grid and the 
comparison with a top-performing (rather than average) ICE means that breakeven may not be 
reached even after 250,000 kilometers (point 4). In this example, a BEV could therefore have 
higher rather than lower lifetime emissions than an ICE.

In reality, however, grids are decarbonizing over time.291 This means that even a BEV put on 
the road today would, over the course of its lifespan, run on a grid that could be progressively 
less emissions intensive. If grids decarbonize in line with stated climate commitments, even an 
average BEV starting on a high-emissions grid today could break even against a top ICE by about 
85,000 kilometers in this example (point 5).

 — Lifetime distance traveled. Once the breakeven distance is crossed, the longer a BEV is 

driven, the greater its carbon savings against an ICE. In the left-hand panel in Exhibit 24, a 
BEV running on a relatively low-emissions-intensive grid, in comparison with an average ICE, 
accumulates carbon savings of about 25 percent after 50,000 kilometers and 55 percent 
by 250,000 kilometers (point 6). For reference, in the United States the average passenger 
vehicle is driven more than 200,000 kilometers over its lifetime. Even the least-driven vehicles 
(first quartile) cover up to 150,000 kilometers, while the most-driven ones (third quartile) cover 
up to over 250,000 kilometers.292 Recently released BEVs are expected to be able to reach 
such distances without needing battery replacements, therefore avoiding additional battery-
manufacturing emissions. For example, in the United States, BEV battery warranties are set at 
a minimum of 160,000 kilometers, while some manufacturers offer battery warranties of up to 
240,000 kilometers.293

Most BEVs are expected to save on carbon over their lifetimes, but this varies significantly  
among regions 
Regional differences in manufacturing emissions, relative running emissions (including the emissions 
intensity of the power grid and the efficiency of the displaced ICEs), and lifetime distance traveled can 
be considerable. For example, battery manufacturing in China (where most batteries are currently 
made) may be up to 50 percent more emissions intensive than it is in South Korea or the United States 
and twice as emissions intensive as in Sweden.294 The grid that powers electric vehicles in Europe is 
about 35 percent less emissions intensive than the grid in the United States and about 65 percent 
less emissions intensive than the grid in India.295 ICE passenger cars in the United States also tend 
have lower fuel economy—producing more emissions per kilometer—than those in Europe.296

Despite this variability, in general most BEVs should surpass carbon breakeven during their lifetime 
of driving, even assuming that current grid emissions intensities persist over time (see the left-hand 
panel of Exhibit 25).297

In Europe and the United States, carbon breakeven against even a top-performing ICE comes 
at 35,000 to 105,000 kilometers for passenger cars under constant grid emissions intensity. 
As a result, in Europe and the United States, BEVs may produce emissions that are about 15 to 
50 percent lower than those of top-performing ICEs over their lifetimes (and 30 to 65 percent 
lower than average-performing ICEs), assuming distances driven of 200,000 kilometers (see the

right-hand panel of Exhibit 25).298 Others have found similar savings for vehicles running on US and 
EU grids over their lifetimes.299

Globally, on average, BEVs are also expected to produce carbon savings. However, they would 
generally have to be driven for longer distances than in the EU and the United States before they 
reach their carbon breakeven, because the global average emissions intensity of power grids 
is higher than it is in these two geographies. Assuming constant emissions intensity, the global 
average carbon breakeven of an average BEV against an average ICE could be about 25,000 to 
70,000 kilometers, and carbon savings could be about 20 to 45 percent. Against a top-performing 
ICE, BEV carbon savings could be less than 25 percent and even below 5 percent. 

In some geographies, vehicles that are powered by high-emissions grids may not reach breakeven 
within their lifetimes if grids do not decarbonize quickly enough. In India today, for instance, about 
75 percent of all electricity is generated using fossil fuels, notably coal.300 If the emissions intensity of 
India’s grid were to remain as it is today, the carbon breakeven point for average BEVs would exceed 
40,000 kilometers in comparison with an average ICE and could be greater than 250,000 kilometers 
in comparison with a top-performing ICE. In this case, therefore, a BEV could end up emitting more 
rather than less emissions than an ICE. 

This means that for BEVs being deployed today to reach carbon breakeven, grids need to 
decarbonize over time. If India’s grid were to decarbonize in line with McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved 
Commitments scenario, its emissions intensity in 2035 would be about 50 percent lower than 
today.301 This would enable a BEV purchased today in India to reach breakeven and achieve 
lifetime carbon savings of as much as 15 percent, even in comparison with a top-performing ICE. 
Furthermore, for BEVs manufactured in coming years, lower manufacturing emissions could also help 
achieve larger carbon savings. If manufacturing emissions were 20 percent lower than today, in India 
carbon savings against a top-performing ICE would increase to about 20 percent.302

In some geographies, vehicles that 
are powered by high-emissions 
grids may not reach breakeven 
within their lifetimes if grids do 
not decarbonize quickly enough.

New manufacturing approaches, a lower-emissions power mix, and increasing BEV range  
could improve BEV carbon savings
Ultimately, the carbon breakeven point between ICEs and BEVs is dynamic over time. Both vehicle 
technologies are on a path of progressively lowering emissions. For example, ICE fuel efficiency 
and tailpipe emissions are improving over time.303 Broadly, to deliver on emissions reduction goals, 
it would be necessary to tackle all three drivers of breakeven discussed above:

 — Manufacturing emissions would need to be reduced. BEV manufacturing emissions may fall over 
time as automotive original equipment manufacturers seek to tackle them. Previous McKinsey 
research estimated that the automotive industry could reduce emissions from manufacturing 
batteries by as much as 75 percent by 2030 if it recycled minerals from used batteries and 
adopted new cell-manufacturing technologies that require less heat, among other levers.304 
Based on announced projects, global battery recycling capacity could grow five times by 2030.305 
Lower manufacturing emissions will also depend on decarbonizing power grids, as well as 
decarbonizing the production and use of key materials in the industrial domain (see chapter 7).

 — Running emissions would have to fall. Globally, power generation is expected to trend toward 

lower-emissions sources over time, even in relatively slower transition scenarios. The emissions 
intensity of grids in G-20 countries has dropped by about 8 percent over the past five years.306 
This means that even a BEV hitting the road today would, over the course of its lifetime, run on 
gradually cleaner grids and generate declining emissions. Changes in the timing of BEV charging 
can also affect emissions. In reality, people charge their cars at various times of the day, and 
therefore the marginal emissions created by BEV charging may be different from the grid average. 
In California, for example, charging a BEV during the day could produce about half the emissions 
that would be produced if charging were to occur during the night.307 According to one study, 
optimizing BEV charging for the carbon intensity of the US grid throughout the day could yield 
an 8 to 14 percent reduction in related carbon emissions.308 In addition, as BEVs become more 
efficient over time, they consume less power for a given distance driven, resulting in even lower 
running emissions.

 — BEVs would need to be driven past their breakeven distances over their lifetimes. Many of the 
first BEVs deployed were driven less than an average ICE. This raised questions about whether 
they would attain enough lifetime mileage to generate carbon savings.309 BEVs tended to be 
driven less often because they were bought as second cars or with the intention of using them 
for shorter commutes. However, over time improvements in performance mean that newer BEVs 
are expected to achieve longer lifetime distances, enabling larger carbon savings over their 
lifetimes.310 Despite these improvements, the current range of BEVs still falls short of the range 
of ICE vehicles, potentially limiting their lifetime distances. For BEVs to continue expanding their 
lifetime distances, they must be capable of covering more and more ICE use cases, in particular 
those involving long-distance driving. The range of BEVs would need to continue to improve, as 
discussed in the next challenge.

§ § §

This is a Level 1 challenge. Ensuring that BEVs abate CO2 emissions over their lifetimes relative to 
ICEs is a significant physical challenge. But there are many indications that tackling it appears to be 
on track at the current course and speed. Much of the transformation to lower breakeven distances 
and higher lifetime carbon savings has been addressed in areas where grids are relatively clean. Even 
where grids are relatively dirty, there are signs that the transformation is progressing, so that grids 
across the world are becoming cleaner over time. Manufacturing emissions related to batteries could 
also fall, and BEVs may become more efficient.

Challenge 8: Going the distance on BEV range (Level 1)
Range matters. The ability to drive passenger vehicles long distances without stopping to refuel is 
a quality many drivers value. BEVs drive shorter distances than ICEs before they need to refuel: an 
average passenger BEV currently has a range of about 400 kilometers, in comparison with about 
650 kilometers for an ICE vehicle. Moreover, BEVs currently take at least 25 to 50 times longer to 
fully charge than ICEs take to refuel (and five to ten times longer than FCEVs). An ICE takes about 
12 seconds to refuel for 100 kilometers of driving, while current best-in-class BEVs take about five to 
ten minutes for the same driving range when using a fast charger.311 

So long as passenger BEVs have limited range before they need recharging, and charging times are 
long, these will be large barriers to adoption. 

Passenger BEVs can meet most range needs across regions, though some harder use  
cases remain
Passenger BEVs are currently able to meet most use cases in driving range needed, but not all. In 
the United States, the average reported range of a BEV is about 400 kilometers.312 However, factors 
such as cold temperatures, battery deterioration, and driving conditions can reduce this range.313 
Accounting for these factors, the median BEV range would still enable more than 70 percent of 
US households to complete almost all of their long single-day journeys (more than 100 kilometers) 
without stopping to recharge—they would have to do so on fewer than five days a year (Exhibit 26).314 
Best-in-class BEVs can do even better. With a reported range of over 800 kilometers, even factoring 
in potential range loss, such BEVs could enable more than 90 percent of US households to complete 
their longest driving journeys while having to stop to recharge on fewer than five days a year.315

In other parts of the world, where daily driving distances tend to be lower than in the United  
States, the share of use cases currently met by BEVs would be even higher. The average driver in 
the United States drives almost twice as far each year than drivers in Australia, France, and the 
United Kingdom.316

Passenger BEVs are currently 
able to meet most use cases in 
driving range needed, but not all.

Although passenger BEVs can already cover the majority of driving use cases in range, consumers 
may place significant weight on unmet, edge, use cases. This could even be the determining factor 
in whether they decide to buy a BEV. Therefore, ensuring that BEVs have sufficient range is a key 
physical challenge.

Continuing innovation to increase the energy density of batteries and other measures would  
be needed 
Technological innovation offers a way forward to use cases that remain unmet. Indeed, this is already 
happening. Between 2011 and 2021, the average range of BEVs increased by about 100 kilometers 
every five years.317 It is possible that the remaining tail of unmet use cases could be served by a 
continuing increase in the energy density of batteries. Although there is some uncertainty, battery 
energy density could improve by about 2 to 3 percent a year as battery technology improves.318

Increasing energy density would be enabled by changing battery chemistry.319 Within this decade, 
graphite anodes are expected to be replaced by graphene–silicon anodes (Exhibit 27). Popular 
cathode chemistries, such as nickel manganese cobalt and lithium iron phosphate, will also likely 
evolve. For example, NMC811 cathodes (80 percent nickel, 10 percent manganese, 10 percent cobalt) 
may be replaced by NMC955 (90 percent nickel, 5 percent manganese, 5 percent cobalt), and lithium 
iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes by lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) ones.

Other battery technologies that are nascent today could be game changers. For example, some 
observers suggest that solid-state batteries could have about double the energy density of today’s 
lithium-ion batteries.320

Innovation can also mitigate some of the factors that reduce the range of BEVs. For example, newer 
BEVs equipped with heat pumps can experience much lower range losses in cold temperatures than 
BEVs equipped with resistance-based heating, given the much higher efficiency of heat pumps.321

Beyond extending the range that batteries can offer, there are nontechnological options, including 
behavioral change, such as accepting the need to charge midtrip. Of course, some users may not 
be willing to accept this trade-off, since charging takes so long in comparison with filling up an ICE 
and, as discussed later, there may be concerns that charging points may not even be available. Other 
approaches to improve the situation have been emerging. One option being discussed is battery 
swapping: EV drivers would make midtrip stops at battery-swapping stations and switch out drained 
batteries for fully charged ones, with time saved relative to charging. This approach could be applied 
to use cases ranging from two-wheelers to heavy-duty trucks.322

§ § §

This is a Level 1 challenge. Battery technologies today already cover the majority of driving use cases in 
range. Only the hardest use cases—long-range driving—remain particularly challenging. Technological 
innovation has helped continue to improve battery energy density, and numerous alternate 
battery chemistries are being explored to continue improvements. Given anticipated technological 
developments, over the next decade all but the very hardest use cases could well be met.

Challenge 9: Loading up electric trucks (Level 3)
For many use cases, the ability to carry (or tow) payloads without stopping to refuel or recharge is 
important. Newer trucking technologies, such as battery electric trucks and hydrogen-powered 
trucks (also known as fuel cell electric trucks), are being considered as replacements for traditional 
ICE-based medium- and heavy-duty trucks, in an effort to reduce emissions. Both technologies 
currently have significant physical challenges that will need to be overcome. 

Battery electric trucks’ physical challenges relate to payload–range trade-offs; fuel cell  
electric trucks have gnarly interdependencies
Market penetration of electric trucks is small today. Adoption is at an early stage, especially for the 
very largest-payload use cases. The stock of such vehicles on the road would need to rise more 
than 100 times by 2050 to achieve the decarbonization of the sector modeled in McKinsey’s 2023 
Achieved Commitments scenario.323 China accounted for nearly 90 percent of medium- and heavy-
duty electric truck sales in 2022, but other regions have experienced growth only recently.324

Heavy-duty battery electric trucks on the market today are far heavier—by two or more tonnes—than 
their diesel counterparts and need to be charged after driving relatively short distances, often less 
than 400 kilometers.325

One potential solution to this challenge around range would be to deploy larger batteries in heavy-duty 
trucks. However, doing so would increase the weight of the trucks, and regulations in many geographies 
require trucks to stay within a certain weight limit. Currently, about 50 percent of all heavy-duty trucks 
in the United States carry payloads within 10 percent of the federal total weight limit. The extra weight of 
battery electric trucks is likely to affect the payloads they can carry.326 Battery electric trucks therefore 
reach a critical point at which any additional battery weight to improve range would require them to 
sacrifice payload. In other words, to increase the range of a battery electric truck by an additional 
kilometer, more battery capacity is needed, which would require extra battery weight and therefore 
reduced payload capacity.

Simulations to quantify the trade-off between payload and range, controlled by the weight of 
the battery, indicate that, to meet a range of 600 kilometers, a battery electric truck could lose 
approximately 2,500 kilograms (about 10 percent) of its payload capacity compared with a diesel 
truck (Exhibit 28).327 Longer ranges mean losing even more payload capacity. To meet a range of 
725 kilometers, a battery electric truck could lose about 4,000 kilograms (some 15 percent) of its 
payload capacity in comparison with a diesel truck. For reference, more than 50 percent of regional 
freight in the United States travels further than 600 kilometers, and 50 percent of long-haul freight 
travels further than 725 kilometers.328

This implies that major changes to the weight trucks carry, the distances they travel, or a shift in 
today’s trucking logistics and charging optimization would be needed to decarbonize trucking— 
a high degree of transformation.

The trade-off between payload and range differs by region because the profiles of trucking fleets and 
regulations vary among geographies. For instance, the average load for domestic transportation in 
Finland is about twice the average in Denmark—that is, weight limits differ significantly even within 
the EU.329 Based on the energy density of batteries today and illustrative weight regulations and 
driving profiles across payloads and distances (using US and EU data), roughly 20 to 45 percent of 
current long-haul trucking use cases could be unmet on a single charge.330

Several use cases thus continue to require higher energy densities than batteries can currently 
offer, at least with current driving patterns and weight regulations. Fuel cell electric trucks offer an 
alternative. They can carry more than battery electric trucks do, because hydrogen is more energy-
dense than batteries (it can carry a larger amount of energy for a lower weight). In general, such 
trucks may still carry a lower payload than ICE trucks for the same range because hydrogen storage 
tanks can shift weight distribution toward the drive axle, potentially above regulated limits on axle 
loads. This case is shown in Exhibit 28.331

However, scaling up fuel cell electric trucks has a different physical challenge. It would require 
building separate hydrogen-refueling stations, which have been only minimally deployed to date, and 
substantial growth in the hydrogen supply chain—a gnarly interdependency with tackling another 
Level 3 challenge (see next section and chapter 10 on the hydrogen domain).

Technological advances and changes to trucking logistics and regulations could help address  
these physical challenges
A portfolio of approaches is being considered to solve payload–range trade-offs. Deploying battery 
electric trucks and fuel cell electric trucks in use cases that make sense specifically for each will be 
important to help mitigate problems stemming from the physical challenges discussed. For example, 
fuel cell electric trucks could be particularly suited to transporting freight over very long distances, 
where BEVs could struggle to meet range requirements.332 While many options are on the table, each 
of them will require large-scale system transformations, continued innovation, or both.

1.  Technological advances in battery energy density. The relatively low energy density of batteries 
is arguably the largest physical challenge holding back battery electric trucks. If the technology 
can continue to improve—specifically, increasing battery energy density—such trucks would 
be able to carry larger payloads over long distances without stopping to refuel. By 2030, 
some estimates suggest that assuming battery densities improve, an average battery electric 
truck could carry as much payload as diesel trucks do today for almost all use cases.333 While 
most electric trucks deployed to date have ranges of less than 500 kilometers, over the past 
year manufacturers have launched new battery electric trucks that have reported ranges of 
800 kilometers while carrying full payloads.334 Nonetheless, only a few dozen trucks capable 
of the longest ranges were on the road as of early 2024, so there is a limited track record 
of performance.335 Recent innovations would need to continue to be scaled commercially. 
Alternative battery chemistries with higher densities could play an important role, but continued 
innovation would be needed, as discussed in the previous challenge.

2.  Changes in weight limits. By relaxing the total weight limit of trucks, additional battery 

weight could be carried for a given payload and range, effectively reducing the trade-off. In 
Europe, proposals are currently in place to allow the total weight of zero-emissions trucks to 
be 4,000 kilograms higher than that of ICE trucks.336 However, there are limits to how much 
additional weight trucks will be allowed to carry, for safety and operational reasons (for example, 
damage to roads and bridges).337

3.  Operational route and charging optimization. In some cases, reconfiguring routes could reduce 
the need to carry large payloads over longer distances. Such reconfigurations could include 
making short-haul routes more frequent—a recent trend—which could increase the share of use 
cases being met by current battery electric trucks.338 Or trucks could stop to recharge during any 
mandatory breaks. In the EU, truck drivers are required to take a break every 4.5 hours; they can 
travel about 400 kilometers between breaks.339 For regions with such regulations, high-power 
charging en route during mandated breaks could enable trucks to travel the same distances they 
could in an ICE, with limited impact on operations.340 However promising, these approaches do 
have limitations and difficulties. For instance, route reconfigurations could require significant 
changes in the planning of logistics for companies, and this may not be feasible, especially for 
floating (not preplanned) routes or those handled by third-party logistics operators, where routes 
are subject to daily demand. The option of charging during mandated breaks could be limited by 
both the availability of the charging infrastructure (which would need to match the places where 
stops would occur) and routes operated by two alternating drivers, so that mandatory breaks are 
not needed.341

4.  The development of hydrogen infrastructure. The development of fuel cell electric trucks would 
also heavily depend on the development of hydrogen infrastructure, namely supply and refueling 
stations along main routes. Some players are experimenting with the development of modular 
refueling stations, with decentralized on-site hydrogen production, which may support relatively 
flexible, rapid, and cost-efficient deployment. That could potentially enable operators to keep 
pace with demand by expanding.342 (For more information on the development of hydrogen 
infrastructure, see chapter 10).

This is a Level 3 challenge, where the use case is hard and the transformation is only just beginning. 
Both technologies for trucking have substantial physical challenges that need to be overcome. 
For battery electric trucks, a major challenge is that the energy density of battery technology 
today is insufficient for some use cases—a significant gap in comparison with fossil fuels to power 
trucks. For fuel cell electric trucks, the largest challenge is that the hydrogen supply chain is not yet 
mature enough to support trucking. Overall, technological innovation would need to continue, the 
deployment of trucks would need to be tailored by use case, logistical planning could require an 
overhaul, and interdependencies with other challenges would need to be solved. 

Challenge 10: Charging up EVs (Level 2) 
If the world is to shift gears toward lower-emissions mobility, there will be a need for more 
manufacturing capacity (particularly of batteries for BEVs and fuel cells for FCEVs), as well as for 
infrastructure, such as charging stations and hydrogen-refueling stations. The physical challenge 
lies in building out capacity and infrastructure at a sufficient pace and scale to meet decarbonization 
goals. This, in turn, also depends on meeting other complex interdependent physical challenges in 
critical minerals, hydrogen, and power—an example of a difficult interdependency between physical 
challenges. Mineral extraction and refining capacity would need to be scaled up, and electricity 
generation from the grid and hydrogen supply would both need to meet demand for charging where it 
takes place.

Smooth-running battery and fuel cell supply chains are needed
In McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, manufacturing capacity for batteries used 
in mobility would need to grow tenfold, to about 5,800 gigawatt-hours, by 2030.343 Manufacturing 
capacity for fuel cells would similarly need to grow, by five to six times by 2030.344

This scale-up appears to be proceeding at a robust pace. If battery production capacity growth 
were to continue at the pace observed from 2018 to 2022, this would be sufficient to meet required 
capacity by 2030.345 Planned announcements suggest that additional manufacturing capacity 
for batteries could be built to achieve 2030 targets, assuming a factory construction time of six 
months to four years.346 In the United States and Europe, recent policy initiatives aimed at providing 
incentives for battery manufacturing have triggered announcements of new capacity additions, often 
from players in Asia.347 China is expected to play a large role, accounting for more than 50 percent of 
total battery production capacity in 2030.348

Similarly, fuel cell manufacturing capacity has been growing. Today, global capacity is about 
20 gigawatts.349 Companies have announced about 70 gigawatts of new capacity. Existing and 
announced capacity are sufficient to cover about 70 percent of the capacity targeted by 2030.350

However, several key challenges remain. The scaling of battery and fuel cell manufacturing depends 
on smooth, uninterrupted supply chains. Although there have been a number of announcements of 
new battery production facilities, the supply chain could also remain relatively concentrated. China 
alone is responsible for more than 70 percent of battery production today.351 Upstream extraction 
and refinement of minerals also needs to scale up substantially and is concentrated.352 This latter key 
interdependency could prove to be the most difficult feature of the challenge (see chapter 9). 

Charging and refueling infrastructure needs to be scaled up 
More charging and refueling infrastructure would also be needed for BEVs and FCEVs. In the case 
of BEVs, both private and public chargers would be required—chargers at homes and in public 
places, such as parking lots at work or school, or along highways and city streets. In McKinsey’s 
2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, global public charging infrastructure would need to grow by 
24 percent per year between 2022 and 2030, from 2.8 million charging points to about 16 million in 
2030, and more than 40 million in 2050.353 In the United States, for example, demand for public and 
private chargers could each grow by 40 percent a year from 2022 to 2030.354 Notably, the number 
of EV-charging points would need to be much higher than today’s tally of gasoline pumps for a

simple reason: an EV takes longer to charge sufficiently to cover a given range than an ICE vehicle 
does to refuel.355

For hydrogen to play a role in decarbonizing trucking, a network of hydrogen-refueling stations for 
FCEVs would need to be built virtually from scratch because current deployment is minimal. Today, 
there are just over 1,000 hydrogen-fueling stations around the world, with the majority located in 
China, Japan, and South Korea.356 The number would need to grow dozens of times by 2050 to 
support the adoption of hydrogen-powered trucks.357 Ensuring the supply of hydrogen to refueling 
stations would be a particularly hard challenge (for further discussion, see chapter 10).

The places where charging and refueling stations are built would need to be considered carefully. For 
example, high-powered fast chargers would need to be placed along major logistics routes so that 
truck drivers can charge during mandatory breaks.

There are signals that the EV-charging infrastructure is now being ramped up, particularly in 
China, which today has about three million public charging points—more than the rest of the world 
combined.358 In the United States, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 and the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022 have spurred additional investment. Seven auto manufacturers are partnering 
to strengthen the fast-charger network in North America, adding more than 30,000 chargers across 
cities and highways starting at the end of 2023.359 In the European Union, the Alternative Fuels 
Infrastructure Regulation mandates hydrogen-refueling stations serving both cars and trucks in all 
urban nodes and every 200 kilometers along major roads from 2030 onward.360

Rolling out the charging and refueling infrastructure has momentum. Nevertheless, the pace and 
scale needed for this scale-up to meet decarbonization goals is very large. Even where legislation 
has been passed to enable the rollout, it has been slow. The United States, for instance, passed a 
bill in 2021 to build a national charging network, but chargers had been installed in only two states 
as of late 2023.361 In the European Union, planning and installing a fast BEV charger can take two 
years on average.362

Electric grids need to meet demand where the charging is taking place 
A final part of this challenge is ensuring that the grid can supply enough power for rising numbers of 
EVs, notably large fleets of medium- and heavy-duty trucks. By 2050, in McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved 
Commitments scenario, the power supply to road mobility amounts to about 5,500 terawatt-hours 
(about 7 percent of total supply in 2050, equivalent to more than 20 percent of supply today). 
Trucks have substantially larger batteries than passenger BEVs and tend to travel on similar routes, 
which could also lead to high electricity demand in geographically concentrated areas. According 
to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), California alone would require more 
than 11 gigawatt-hours a day to meet the projected 2030 charging needs of medium- and heavy-
duty vehicles. This would be roughly equivalent to 2 percent of current daily electricity demand 
in California on a winter day, which appears to be modest, but since it is only to charge trucks, it 
is still significant.363 Across the United States, this number could be nearly 140 gigawatt-hours, 
requiring nearly 69 gigawatts of additional power capacity across local distribution grids. The ICCT 
further predicts that the charging needed would be geographically concentrated, with 1 percent of 
US counties accounting for 15 percent of medium- and heavy-duty vehicle-charging demand.364 
Sufficient grid capacity would need to be available, and the careful planning of transmission and 
distribution systems would also be required—and the additional generation capacity would need to 
generate low emissions (see chapter 5). 

§ § §

This is a Level 2 challenge. Manufacturing and infrastructure capacity have been growing. Still, the 
size of the required scale-up is massive, indicating a relatively high degree of transformation and a 
need to manage interdependencies with other physical challenges, including securing minerals and 
hydrogen, as well as scaling the power system to meet charging demand.

Note: This research examines 25 significant physical challenges in seven domains at the core of the energy transition, categorized in three levels. 
Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require the deployment of 
known technologies to accelerate, and associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological 
performance (often with demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning. The focus is on physical realities because 
they influence the ability to design an interdependent system that has performance comparable to that of the current system and to reduce emissions feasibly. 
These factors influence cost and affordability. Nonphysical factors—notably cost—are important but are not the focus of this research. Assessment of required 
deployment of technologies primarily draws on McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, which assumes that countries that have committed to net 
zero (some by 2050, some later) meet those commitments, and in which warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. This scenario is used 
because it provides sufficient regional and sectoral granularity for assessing required deployment. In some instances, this research also uses scenarios from 
other sources for reasons of data availability.

Industry accounts for about one-third of global CO2 emissions in the energy system.365 Within 
industry, decarbonizing steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia is a particularly important effort  
given that these four big material pillars of the modern world account for about two-thirds of 
industrial emissions.366

 — Steel. This is a ubiquitous material, valued because of its durability, tensile strength, and 

versatility for multiple applications. About 1.8 billion tonnes is produced every year, enough to 
build the equivalent of 24,000 Golden Gate Bridges.367 The construction industry is the largest 
consumer of steel, followed by transportation, machinery, and metal products.368 Producing steel 
is the direct source of 10 percent of global CO2 emissions from the energy system.369 Each tonne 
of primary steel produced results in about two tonnes of CO2 emissions.370

 — Cement. A key ingredient of concrete, cement is a critical component of the built environment. 

Since 1950, as the global economy and population have grown and urbanized, cement 
production has soared 30-fold.371 Every year, about 4.2 billion tonnes of cement are produced,  
or enough to build one million Statues of Liberty.372 In fact, cement is the most consumed 
human-made material on Earth. It accounts for about 7 percent of global CO2 emissions from 
the energy system. 

 — Plastics. The versatility of plastics means that they are used in myriad ways. Consider, for 

instance, that plastics account for about 15 percent of the weight of an average car and for about 
50 percent of the weight of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.373 Every year, 380 million tonnes 
of plastic are produced, equivalent to the weight of about 1,000 Empire State Buildings.374 They 
account for about 4 percent of global CO2 emissions from the energy system.375

 — Ammonia. Ammonia is essential for both agriculture and industry.376 About 70 percent of 

ammonia produced is used in the manufacture of agricultural fertilizers. It has been estimated 
that, without the application of ammonia-based fertilizers and the corresponding increase in 
agricultural yields, it would not be possible to feed, at current levels, roughly half of today’s 
global population.377 The remaining approximately 30 percent of ammonia produced is used 
in a range of industrial applications, including in the manufacture of explosives, textiles, and 
pharmaceuticals and dyes.378 Every year, more than 180 million tonnes of ammonia is produced. A 
new energy system would require new types of energy carriers to transport clean energy around 
the world, and ammonia could play a key role. The use of ammonia as a carrier in transporting 
hydrogen over long distances could potentially result in its production at even higher volumes 
than today. Hydrogen converted into ammonia has higher volumetric energy density and fewer 
safety concerns and could therefore be easier to move over long distances than hydrogen itself 
(see chapter 10).379 Production of ammonia accounts for about 1 percent of global CO2 emissions 
from the energy system. The main source of emissions is the production of hydrogen, which is 
a necessary input. More than 99 percent of hydrogen is currently produced in high-emissions 
processes using fossil fuels, namely steam-methane reforming.380

As part of the energy transition, these four materials would need to be decarbonized, and as yet, 
the transformation is in its early stages. As of 2022, about seven billion tonnes a year of steel, 
cement, plastics, and ammonia were produced, and less than 10 percent of that was through low-
emissions processes. In the IEA’s Net Zero scenario, that figure would need to rise to between 90 and 
95 percent by 2050.381 Furthermore, almost all of the progress thus far has been in low-emissions 
secondary production, such as recycling. Almost no primary production is low emissions today. 
Further decarbonization would require scaling recycling but also decarbonizing primary production, 
which would be a harder endeavor.

The production processes for these four materials are difficult to decarbonize. They often rely on fossil 
fuels both as feedstocks (for example, to produce plastics or ammonia), which creates a substitution 
need; and as sources of high-temperature heat (for example, burning coal to produce high heat 
for cement production). Decarbonizing the production of high-temperature heat is harder than 
decarbonizing low- and medium-temperature heat. Electrification, in particular, is often more difficult 
for two main reasons. First, a narrower set of low-emissions technologies can deliver high heat. For 
example, heat pumps and mechanical vapor recompression evaporators can only reach temperatures 
of about 250 to 300°C. Second, the delivery of higher-temperature heat can require larger asset 
reconfigurations, because the form of heat transfer often needs to change.382 Other heat sources, 
such as alternative fuels, could play a role in producing high-temperature heat—often with less 
retrofitting required—but they also face significant challenges in securing reliable inputs. 

The direct emissions of these four industries fall into two broad categories: (1) emissions from the 
burning of fossil fuels (accounting for about 55 percent of total emissions); and (2) process emissions 
released as a byproduct of the chemical processes that take place during production of these 
materials (about 45 percent of emissions).383

In addition to these four key materials, the research also looked at a category called “other 
industries.” This group encompasses a wide variety of industries, including food processing, 
papermaking, and other general manufacturing. In this category, emissions are largely from the 
production of heat, although at relatively lower temperatures.384 Together, other industries account 
for about 12 percent of global CO2 emissions from the energy system. 

Five physical challenges have been identified in the broad industry domain: (1) furnacing low-
emissions steel; (2) cementing change for construction; (3) cracking the challenge of plastics; (4) 
synthesizing low-emissions ammonia production; and (5) heating other industries. The first four 
relate to decarbonizing the four key industrial materials and are Level 3 challenges, reflecting the 
fact that the use case is hard and the transformation is just beginning. The remaining challenge, 
associated with decarbonizing other industries, is Level 2; deployment of known technologies 
would need to accelerate.385

Decarbonizing industrial processes would require a combination of approaches 
Each specific industry faces different challenges in abating emissions, but there are some common 
approaches to decarbonization. In many cases, the easiest measure to implement is increasing 
efficiency by improving plant utilization, insulation, and equipment effectiveness, and recovering 
waste heat. Raising energy efficiency can cut emissions, and often costs, and is possible largely 
with mature technologies.386 But raising energy efficiency is not sufficient—fundamental changes in 
today’s industrial processes are required. A combination of five approaches can be considered, and 
are explored across challenges. 

 — Feedstock substitution. Switching the inputs used in order to reduce emissions that are 

generated as a byproduct of the industrial process. An example is replacing coking coal with 
hydrogen to remove oxygen from iron ore during the production of steel.387

 — Electrification of heat. Generating heat from electricity rather than fossil fuels. An example is 

electrifying crackers used to make plastics.388

 — Switch to alternative fuels. Instead of electrifying heat production, different fuels could be used. 

An example is burning hydrogen or biomass.

 — Carbon capture. Emissions not abated by other means could be removed via carbon capture.  

An example is carbon capture in cement production. 

 — End-product substitution. Industrial products that are hard to decarbonize could be replaced by 

low-emissions alternatives. An example is replacing cement with cross-laminated timber. 

The following sections explore the role these approaches could play and the physical challenges 
that may stand in the way and that would need to be addressed for decarbonization. While this 
report does not focus on the cost of decarbonization solutions, many (but not all) of these new 
approaches to decarbonizing major industrial materials would likely entail an increase in cost, 
at least in the short term. Driving this increase would be new physical realities, including more 
expensive inputs (such as hydrogen), the need to reconfigure existing industrial assets and 
processes (such as adding carbon capture), and deploying more nascent technologies.389

Challenge 12

Challenge 12: Furnacing low-emissions steel (Level 3)
Coauthored with Christian Hoffmann 

Decarbonizing the production of primary (virgin) steel—steel that is not recycled and is made from 
iron ore—is a hard physical challenge. Alternatives would be needed for both of the roles fossil fuels 
play, as a feedstock and as a source of energy. 

Primary steel accounts for about 75 percent of total steel production today. Almost all production 
today follows a high-emissions process releasing about two tonnes of CO2 emissions per tonne 
of steel created (see Sidebar 7, “Choices in steel manufacturing feedstocks and processes—and 
associated carbon dioxide emissions”).390 Secondary steel is essentially recycled steel and accounts 
for the remaining 25 percent of current steel production. It is made in electric arc furnaces (EAFs) that 
do not use fossil fuels directly.391 This is a lower-emissions process than production of primary steel, 
releasing 50 to 85 percent less CO2 for every tonne of steel produced.392

The asset base associated with primary steel production is enormous and global—more than 
1,400 blast furnaces operate today around the world.393 Most large integrated steel production 
facilities, which often contain many blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces, can produce two 
million to ten million tonnes of steel per year.394 Some sites are even larger. For instance, South 
Korea’s Gwangyang plant houses five blast furnaces and has the capacity to produce 18 million 
to 23 million tonnes of steel per year. This single facility is about six times the size of New York’s 
Central Park.395

Decarbonizing steel production will require multiple technologies, both by scaling secondary steel 
production through the mature scrap–EAF pathway and by deploying new technologies to replace 
the blast furnace–basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) process for primary steel production. Four options 
are discussed: (1) the scrap–EAF recycling process; (2) a direct iron reduction–electric arc furnace 
(DRI-EAF) process that directly reduces iron using natural gas or hydrogen reductants; (3) a DRI–
premelter–BOF process that follows the DRI with a premelter step and then produces steel in a BOF; 
and (4) a BF–BOF–CCUS process that adds carbon capture to the conventional BF-BOF process 
(Exhibit 29). 

More than 1,400 blast furnaces 
operate today around the world.

Sidebar 7. Choices in steel  
manufacturing feedstocks  
and processes—and associated 
carbon dioxide emissions 

The various steelmaking options differ in 
their feedstocks and process steps. Typical 
options are discussed below:

1. Choice of input iron. Steelmaking requires 
first and foremost a source of iron. In the 
case of primary steel, raw iron ore, which 
contains iron in the form of iron oxide, is 
used. This can differ in its grade and level of 
impurity. While the conventional BF-BOF 
process is fairly flexible on the grade it can 
process, DRI-EAF requires high-grade 
iron ore (see further discussion later in 
this chapter). In the case of secondary 
steelmaking, scrap steel is the main input. 

2. Choice of reductant. In the case of 
primary steelmaking, reductants help  
split the oxygen from the iron oxide in  
the iron ore to convert it into iron. In the 
BF-BOF process, the reductant is coke, 

made from coal. In the DRI process  
today, either coal or natural gas is used as 
a reductant. The use of hydrogen (either 
pure or blended with natural gas) as an 
alternative reductant is being developed 
in new low-emissions steel processes.1 
In the case of secondary steelmaking, no 
reductant is required. 

3. Iron-making process. In this step, 
applicable only in primary steelmaking, 
iron is produced from raw iron ore. 
Conventionally, this step is performed  
in a blast furnace, where pig (molten)  
iron is made from raw iron ore through  
a reduction process that removes 
the oxygen present in the iron ore. As 
mentioned above, this process uses coke  
as an input, producing CO2. Today, this  
step accounts for most of the emissions— 
70 percent—in integrated steel production 
that uses the BF-BOF process.2 An 
alternative process for iron making is the 
DRI process, in which the oxygen is removed 
using a reductant agent (which could be 
coal, natural gas, or hydrogen). In some 
cases, the DRI process is coupled with a 

premelter to separate the molten iron  
from impurities.3

4. Steelmaking process. Conventionally, 
this step takes place in a BOF in which pure 
oxygen is blown into a vessel containing 
pig iron to remove excess carbon and other 
impurities. In some cases, alloying agents 
such as nickel, vanadium, and manganese 
are added. This is comparatively a lower-
emissions step, accounting for only 
10 percent of steel emissions today.4 Instead 
of a BOF, an EAF, which generates heat 
from an electric arc between electrodes, 
can be used.5 EAFs can be used for making 
secondary steel and for making primary 
steel in processes following the DRI-EAF 
approach (when iron ore used in DRI is of 
sufficiently high grade). 

5. Carbon capture process. In some 
technological pathways, a carbon capture 
step could be added to remove emissions 
not abated elsewhere. This is the case for 
the BF-BOF-CCUS process but could also 
be applied to some DRI-EAF variants where 
natural gas is used as a reductant. 

The blast furnace step accounts 
for 70% of steel emissions.

pathway is that the BOF manages to remove impurities more effectively than an EAF.

Note that other novel approaches, such as direct electrification (molten oxide electrolysis) and using 
biomass as a reductant, could also be explored further, but they are not analyzed in detail here.396

Scaling these approaches would require addressing several aspects of the process. Technological 
uncertainty remains regarding the viability of scaling different technologies, given that most of them 
are fairly nascent. A large degree of reconfiguration would be needed to replace existing assets 
(for instance, blast furnaces) with new low-emissions ones, and additional inputs and infrastructure 
would be needed. Furthermore, interdependencies with other challenges, namely hydrogen and 
carbon capture, would have to be tackled. 

Overall, a mix of these technology options would likely be required, with particular options being 
deployed in different regions and with varied sequencing and timing. As discussed below, this is 
because physical challenges and trade-offs accompany each option.

Secondary steel production is relatively low-emissions and mature, but its use is currently  
limited by scrap availability and product performance 
Producing secondary steel is a mature and low-emissions process. It emits 50 to 85 percent less 
CO2 than the conventional BF-BOF approach depending on the emissions intensity of the grid 
used to power the EAF.397 As such, ramping up secondary steel manufacturing could support the 
decarbonization of overall steel production. 

There are two main limitations on scaling the production of secondary steel. The first is whether 
required inputs are available in sufficient quantities. Today, about 700 million tonnes of scrap are 
used a year, but increasing this amount would be needed to scale production of secondary steel.398 
To achieve this would require an expanded supply of scrap, which would entail changes across the 
life cycle of steel products, from design that makes recycling them easier to ensuring that they are 
collected and separated effectively when they reach the end of their usefulness, through improved 
recycling techniques. The second limitation is that steel produced from scrap may not meet the 
requirements of some steel products.399

Factoring in these hurdles, the share of global steel demand met by secondary steel could rise from 
the current 25 percent to about 45 percent by 2050, in McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments 
scenario. The remaining 55 percent would need to be met through low-emissions manufacturing of 
primary steel, described in the following sections. 

DRI-EAF requires access to crucial inputs, including low-emissions hydrogen and power,  
and suitable iron ore
The high-emissions blast furnace step could be replaced with direct reduction of iron ore using 
natural gas, hydrogen, or a combination, producing DRI.400 This reduced iron is then loaded into an 
EAF to produce steel. When using natural gas (without carbon capture), between 25 and 50 percent 
of emissions could be abated relative to the conventional BF-BOF process. The use of hydrogen as a 
reductant, instead of fossil fuels, could abate between 75 and 90 percent of emissions depending on 
the emissions intensity of the grid used to produce hydrogen and power the EAF.401

The DRI process itself is mature. Natural gas–based DRI plants have existed for decades, mostly in 
the Middle East.402 Now options are being explored to replace or blend natural gas with hydrogen, 
which would produce lower emissions with the same technology. The first fossil-fuel-free steel was 
produced in 2021 in Sweden, and multiple industrial-scale projects are expected to begin operating 
in the mid- to late 2020s.403 The primary hurdles are whether necessary inputs are available and 
addressing interdependencies with other challenges. They include the following: 

 — Low-emissions power. DRI-based steel requires a great deal of power to run the electrolyzers 
that produce hydrogen as well as for the EAF step.404 For example, producing one tonne of 
hydrogen-based steel could require more than 3.0 megawatt-hours of power, compared with 
0.1 megawatt-hour using BF-BOF.405 Some players have plans to co-locate steel plants near 
low-emissions power sources built specifically to serve those plants. For example, the planned

HYBRIT low-emissions steel project in Sweden has located its hydrogen-based DRI plant  
near hydropower and wind power sources in order to have access to the low-emissions power  
it requires.406

 — Low-emissions hydrogen. As discussed above, using low-emissions hydrogen in DRI can abate 
more emissions per tonne of steel than using natural gas.407 But in many regions, natural gas is 
currently easier to source and distribute than hydrogen.408 Some estimate that hydrogen-based 
steel production could account for more than 10 percent of hydrogen consumption by 2050, 
if efficiency, scale, transportation, and safety issues can be appropriately managed (for more 
detail, see chapter 10 on the hydrogen domain).409 One option being considered is decoupling 
the manufacturing of iron and steel. Some steelmaking facilities may opt to source DRI directly, 
obviating the need to transport or produce hydrogen locally.410

 — High-grade iron input. DRI requires high-grade iron input, supply of which is limited.411 

Using lower-grade iron ore is possible, but doing so reduces yields. Less than 10 percent 
of current global supply of iron ore is suitable for DRI, and it has proven hard to ramp up the 
amount available.412 Iron-ore projects have long lead times, and few additional projects have 
been identified that could potentially produce high-grade ore.413 Another option to consider 
is attempting to improve low-quality iron ore to make it more suitable for the DRI process, 
referred to as beneficiation. An estimated 5 percent of global iron-ore supply could be suitable 
for beneficiation in a cost-effective way.414 Even if more DRI-grade iron ore mining projects 
were scaled, and even if potential for beneficiation were achieved, it is estimated that less 
than 20 percent of global supply would be suitable as an input.415 Given this limitation, other 
technological options that can handle lower-grade iron would be required in order to produce 
low-emissions steel. These options are discussed next.

DRI-premelter-BOF is more flexible to accommodate lower-grade iron ore but is still in  
the demonstration phase 
In this approach, the first step is the direct reduction of the iron (as in the approach just discussed). 
The DRI is then loaded onto a premelter, which melts and refines it before it is finally transferred to a 
BOF, where it undergoes further refining and alloying to produce steel.416

Theoretically, the advantage of this approach is that it can accommodate lower-grade iron because 
purification of the iron ore takes place in both the premelter and the BOF.417 Like traditional DRI 
technology, this approach requires the availability of low-emissions power and reductants such as 
hydrogen. However, this approach is more technologically nascent and uncertain. While premelter 
technologies have been used in other metals, this approach has not been demonstrated at scale in 
steelmaking. Trials are ongoing at the Port Kembla Steelworks in Australia.418

BF-BOF-CCUS could be useful in managing asset turnover but has not been deployed yet  
and may not abate emissions effectively 
In this process, the conventional BF-BOF is retained and CCUS added. The inclusion of CCUS could 
be particularly useful for minimizing asset turnover that would otherwise be required in existing high-
emissions assets. 

Between now and 2030, about 60 percent of the global blast furnace capacity is due to be relined, 
that is, have their interior linings replaced or refurbished (Exhibit 30).419 This poses a choice for 
steelmakers: reline their blast furnaces or decommission them and replace them with lower-
emissions processes, discussed above. This choice is complicated by the fact that alternative 
low-emissions steel technologies are only just being commercially deployed and are not yet cost 
competitive. In the cases where steelmakers opt to reline their existing blast furnaces, this would 
effectively extend their useful life, retaining a high-emissions asset in operation. 

The advantage of CCUS would be that it could be deployed with existing assets, enabling emission 
abatement without cutting short the useful life of those assets and, therefore, essentially extending 
the time steelmakers have to consider other technologies.

However, using CCUS in steel itself has issues. The relatively low concentration of CO2 in BF-BOF flue 
gases makes it difficult and costly to capture carbon. In 2023, no BF-BOF was operating with CCUS, 
although large initial prototypes are being tested in China, Europe, Japan, and North America.420 
There is substantial uncertainty about achievable CCUS capture rates in BF-BOF, with estimates 
ranging from about 50 to 90 percent.421 Another hurdle is the fact that capacity to store and use 
the captured CO2 is location dependent and may face competition from carbon captured in other 
industries (for more details on these hurdles, see chapter 11). 

Other technologies are even more nascent 
As noted, other technologies are being studied, including molten oxide electrolysis and bioenergy-
fueled heating coupled with CCUS. The issue is that both of these technologies are only in their 
early R&D phases.422 Molten-ore electrolysis could be used to directly electrify the production of 
low-emissions steel—without requiring hydrogen or other reductants—and is expected to start 
being commercialized in the late 2020s.423 Small-scale pilots of biomass reductant are under way 
in Germany.424

§ § §

This is a Level 3 challenge. Decarbonizing steel is a hard physical challenge since primary production 
currently relies heavily on fossil fuels both for the production of high-temperature heat and as a 
reductant. Overall, the scale of the transformation is large; almost no low-emissions primary steel is 
produced today. A combination of technologies would be required, each with its own challenges. In 
some cases, technologies are already commercial and could be scaled further, notably scrap–EAF

and DRI. In other cases, many other technologies needed are still nascent, notably premelters and 
CCUS when applied to BF-BOFs, which would require additional innovation and scaling. Scaling 
low-emissions primary steelmaking would also require additional inputs, notably scrap steel, low-
emissions hydrogen and power, and high-grade iron ore. In addition, gnarly interdependencies with 
other challenges, including hydrogen and CCUS, would need to be tackled, and this would require 
collaboration among players across different sectors. 

Challenge 13

Challenge 13: Cementing change for construction (Level 3)
Coauthored with Ken Somers

Decarbonizing cement is a hard physical challenge because producing this material generates 
emissions in two distinct ways. First, process emissions arise from the chemical processes 
associated with the conversion of limestone to lime. Second, the calcination and clinkerization steps 
create heat emissions from the burning of fossil fuels for the high-temperature heat they require (see 
Sidebar 8, “Cement production,” for a detailed description of these processes). Together, these two 
account for about 85 percent of emissions associated with cement production.425

To replace current high-emissions production with lower-emissions alternatives, new technologies 
and processes would need to be scaled. It is likely that a combination of approaches would be 
needed. This research focuses on four: (1) clinker substitution to reduce process emissions;  
(2) alternative fuels and electrification options to replace fossil-fuel combustion; (3) carbon 
capture options; and (4) options to reduce cement emissions by replacing cement with alternative 
construction materials. Other novel approaches to decarbonizing cement have not been analyzed in 
detail in this research.426

Each of these approaches faces different issues, among them technological maturity and 
performance, including the ability to produce high-temperature heat without using fossil fuels; 
capture rates of CCS approaches and product performance in the case of some substitutes; 
required reconfiguration of existing assets; and the additional inputs that would have to be secured 
(Exhibit 31). 

Sidebar 8. Cement production 

Producing cement has three main stages:

1. Extraction and initial processing. 
Limestone and other raw materials are 
quarried, crushed, milled, mixed, and 
ground to a sufficiently small size. This 
stage accounts for about 5 percent of CO2 
emissions per tonne of cement produced.1

2. Clinker production. This mixture is 
preheated in a multistage combustion 
chamber called a precalciner and fed into a 

kiln, where two processes occur, both  
of which require high-temperature 
heat. First is calcination, which turns 
limestone into lime at about 800ºC to 
900ºC. Calcination accounts for almost 
90 percent of total energy consumption 
when producing high-heat in cement 
production. Second is “clinkerization,” in 
which a reaction between the lime and 
other materials happens at even higher 
temperatures of about 1,500ºC to 1,600ºC, 
accounting for about 10 percent of energy 
consumption for heat.2 CO2 is a byproduct of 

these steps, both from the burning of fossil 
fuels and from the chemical conversion from 
limestone to lime. At the end of the clinker 
production stage, small lumps of stony 
residue called clinker, the key ingredient 
in cement, are left. Together, these stages 
account for about 85 percent of CO2 
emissions of cement production.3

3. Final manufacturing. The clinker is 
ground to a powder and combined with other 
ingredients to produce cement. This final 
stage accounts for the remaining 10 percent 
of CO2 emissions per tonne of cement.4

Substituting clinker can abate process emissions and faces the least hurdles in the near term 
CO2 emitted during the conventional production of cement is directly proportional to the amount 
of clinker used, since production of clinker accounts for the lion’s share of cement emissions.427 
Therefore, a key way to abate emissions is partial substitution of clinker with alternative ingredients, 
also called supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs).428 These materials serve a similar function 
to that of clinker, contributing to the binding, hardening, and strength development of cementitious 
materials, but with lower CO2 emissions.

On the whole, the use of SCMs is commercially mature, and this option can be deployed in the 
near term. However, the cost of clinker substitutes varies greatly. They also face two main physical 
constraints: first, they vary in the degree to which they can replace clinker; second, they vary  
in availability.

In terms of performance, the substitutability of SCMs depends on the cement use case or the specific 
exposure conditions that structures may encounter. For example, there may be limits if cement is to 
be exposed to freezing-and-thawing cycles with frequent exposure to water and exposure to deicing 
chemicals, where the concern may be surface defects.429 Moreover, the proportion of clinker that can 
be substituted by SCMs is governed by current industry and regulatory standards and guidelines.

Input availability may also be an issue in some cases. Some clinker substitutes, including fly ash from 
coal power plants and slag from blast furnaces, have already been deployed, but they may become 
scarce as power and steel decarbonize.430 This could require other substitutes. Natural pozzolans and 
calcined clays are two promising alternatives to clinker that have demonstrated technical viability and 
could replace 30 to 40 percent of the clinker used today (depending on the application).431 Natural 
pozzolans are made from natural fly ash produced from volcanic material and are relatively available 
in dry or volcanic regions. Calcined clays, also referred to as metakaolin, are produced from heating a 
source of kaolinite that is naturally occurring in clay deposits, tropical soils, and industrial byproducts 
such as paper sludge, waste, and oil sands tailings.432

While more effort is needed to scale the availability of inputs, substituting clinker is progressing,  
and some cements made with calcined clay are already available in Europe. In Denmark, calcined  
clay blended cement is being sold. In France, a flash calciner to produce calcined clay was 
commissioned early in 2023.433

Using clinker substitutes is promising in the short term, but there are constraints on how  
much substitution can be done, and therefore other approaches would also be required to 
decarbonize cement. 

§ § §

Switching to electrification or alternative fuels could reduce heat emissions, but technological  
maturity and input issues remain 
Burning fossil fuels to produce high-temperature heat accounts for about 30 to 40 percent of 
total cement emissions, all of which could potentially be abated if heat could be produced with 
electrification or alternative fuels. 

The main physical hurdles to full electrification are technological maturity and the need for asset 
reconfigurations or retrofits. Technological maturity, in particular, is relevant for electrification 
options for the clinkerization step. It has been demonstrated that it is feasible to electrify the 
calcination step (which accounts for 90 percent of the theoretical heat load for cement production 
and operates below 1,000ºC) in the LEILAC pilot concept.434 This pilot has used standard resistive 
elements and new technologies, such as rotodynamic heaters, to provide heat at the desired 
temperatures. The clinkerization step (which accounts for the remaining 10 percent of the theoretical 
heat load and reaches temperatures of around 1,500ºC) is technically more challenging due to both 
the temperature increases and changes to material properties that occur in this step. The material 
becomes more viscous and sticky, which limits potential asset redesign options.435

More broadly, the need to substantially retrofit existing cement assets for full electrification is a 
challenge for both steps. This is because the heat delivery mechanism associated with electrification 
is different, and existing precalciners and kilns would need to be replaced by new electric 
alternatives. One option being considered is electrification of the calciner alone, as it is technically 
easier, and a larger fraction of the existing asset base could be reused. 

Despite such challenges, commercial approaches to electrify calcination and even clinkerization are 
starting to be deployed. For example, in Finland, a project using a RotoDynamic Heater is expected

to start industrial-scale operation by the end of 2024.436 In Sweden, an electric arc calciner has 
been tested to produce clinker using electric plasma heating instead of a traditional kiln, albeit on a 
precommercial scale. 

As well as reducing emissions, electrifying clinkerization and/or calcination could offer two additional 
benefits. The first is that it would make carbon capture easier—removing fossil fuel burning allows 
for more concentrated and controlled CO2 streams from calcination (see the section below).437 The 
second benefit would be that an electrified process, if coupled with thermal storage, would, in effect, 
be a large battery that would provide demand-side flexibility in the electricity network (see Challenge 
3 in the discussion of the power domain).

Alternative fuels such as waste or biomass are already commercially deployed, and they could be 
combined with electrification (for example, by using electricity as a source of heat for calcination, 
while using biomass for the clinkerization step). For example, in Austria, up to 90 percent of the 
fuels used in the cement industry are alternative.438 These fuels only require modest retrofits to be 
used in existing kilns, as they have similar properties to traditional fuels. However, some alternative 
fuels, notably hydrogen, require extensive kiln redesign and are less likely to play a significant role 
in cement decarbonization.439 The main issue with alternative fuels is the extent to which they will be 
available.440 Competition for such fuels may increase as other sectors decarbonize. 

Carbon capture could be deployed in cement production, but it is nascent, and performance  
at scale remains uncertain 
Carbon capture has the potential in theory to abate more than 85 percent, and as much as 
99 percent, of cement emissions of a given asset if deployed to its full potential, and it could thus  
play a key role in decarbonizing cement.441

However, several difficulties exist. The main one is the fact that cement-related flue gases have low 
concentrations of CO2—about 20 to 30 percent—and this makes it hard to reach high capture rates 
without substantial cost increases (see chapter 11).442 Furthermore, the deployment of CCUS in 
cement is still relatively nascent and has not occurred at scale. 

Initial projects are being developed in Belgium, Germany, Spain, and North America but are small 
in scale, with low target capture rates.443 The LEILAC-1 project heats limestone in a steel reactor, 
using a physically separated heat convertor that enables pure CO2 to be separated and captured 
as it is released from limestone (preventing CO2 from being released with other exhaust gases).444 
Constructed next to a cement plant in Lixhe, Belgium, the first pilot was able to capture 5 percent of a 
typical cement plant’s process CO2 emissions. With the second pilot, the aim is to capture 20 percent 
of the process emissions of a full-scale cement plant.445 Current CCUS processes would still have to 
be tested and developed at larger scales to achieve higher capture rates and increase their emissions 
abatement potential.

Alternative construction materials to cement could be deployed, but sufficient performance  
depends on the use case
Concrete today dominates urban landscapes, but a range of other materials could be used instead 
for many construction projects. Even today, the buildings of two major European airports have a 
similar shape but use different materials—Charles de Gaulle, in Paris, is primarily built using concrete, 
whereas Brussels Airport mainly uses steel.446

Some estimates suggest that alternative construction materials could substitute for more than 
10 percent of cement, and potentially many times more than that.447 One promising example is 
cross-laminated timber (CLT), which has a strength-to-weight ratio that rivals concrete. Its use has 
increased, particularly in Canada, Japan, and Sweden.448 A review of 27 studies found that CLT 
could potentially reduce the carbon footprint of multistory buildings by about 40 percent, albeit with 
significant case-by-case variation because of factors such as the location and design of buildings.449 
There are a considerable number of CLT producers, mostly in Europe and North America.450 Other 
materials could also be used in different types of buildings. For instance, the first zero-emissions 
brick production line opened in Belgium in 2022.451

One key limitation to the deployment of alternative materials is that their performance is different 
from concrete’s, and so whether they can be deployed depends massively on the specific use case. 

Overall, while many alternative construction materials are mature and could be scaled in the  
short term, there are limits—and uncertainty—about how large the substitution potential  
could be. Therefore, this approach would need to be paired with the cement decarbonization 
alternatives discussed. 

§ § §

This is a Level 3 challenge. Decarbonizing cement is a hard physical challenge because primary 
production relies heavily on fossil fuels for high-temperature heat production, and the production 
process itself creates emissions from the calcination of limestone. Almost no low-emissions cement 
is being produced today. Decarbonizing cement would require a mix of approaches, some of which 
are already feasible in the short term, especially by using alternative materials, clinker substitution, 
and some alternative fuels such as biomass—approaches that are mature and already deployed to 
an extent. However, many of the required approaches to advance decarbonization still face hard 
challenges, including technological uncertainty in electrification and performance limitations in 
current carbon capture rates. Decarbonizing cement would also require a large-scale retrofit and 
reconfiguration of existing assets as well as scaling access to important inputs, including clinker 
substitutes and biomass. 

Challenge 14

Challenge 14: Cracking the challenge of plastics (Level 3)
Coauthored with Adam Youngman

Decarbonizing plastics, one of the key products of the petrochemical industry, is a hard physical 
challenge because fossil fuels are integral to their production. As the source of the essential 
molecules that make up plastics, oil and gas products are plastics’ primary feedstocks and are also  
used to generate the high-temperature heat required for their production (see Sidebar 9, “The four 
stages of the plastics life cycle”). 

To replace the current approach with lower-emissions alternatives, new technologies and processes 
would be required. Four ways of decarbonizing plastics are discussed: (1) deploying new sources of 
heat and CCUS on processes that use fossil-fuel feedstocks; (2) switching to biobased or synthetic 
feedstock; (3) recycling end-of-life plastics to act as new feedstock; and (4) substituting plastics 
in products with other materials (Exhibit 32).452 This section focuses on the contribution of these 
approaches to decarbonizing plastics production, but it is important to note that some of them 
would also contribute to abating emissions related to upstream oil and gas emissions by leading to a 
reduction in the use of fossil fuels.

Some of these approaches are mature and deployable in the short term, but others would require 
further innovation. To deploy these options at scale, several aspects of the challenge will have 
to be considered. First, the ability of some of the new technologies to match the performance of 
existing fossil-fuel-based approaches (specifically in the ability to generate high-temperature heat) 
has not been established, and many of these technologies are still nascent. To deploy these new 
technologies at scale would require securing additional inputs—notably alternative feedstocks. 
Finally, some of these approaches would entail a large reconfiguration of the existing asset base, 
retrofits, and, in some cases, potentially scrapping and rebuilding.

Sidebar 9. The four stages of the 
plastics life cycle

The plastics life cycle generally has four 
main stages, with some variations linked to 
the specific type of plastic being produced.1 
Each stage generates a meaningful share 
of emissions, although exact shares 
depend greatly on the specific plastic being 
produced, choice of feedstock, and end-of-
life treatment. Plastics production in the EU 
is used as a reference, excluding emissions 
related to upstream extraction of fossil fuels.2

1.  Refining. Natural gas and crude oil, which 
are separated into ethane, naphtha, 
and other components (precursors), 
account for 5 to 10 percent of emissions 
from plastics production. Emissions 

2. 

are generated largely from heating and 
cooling during separations. 

Intermediate synthesis. Precursors 
are converted into ethylene and other 
monomers (short carbon chains) through 
reactions such as steam “cracking” in 
which feedstocks are heated to very 
high temperatures—as high as 850°C 
to 1,100°C—in the presence of steam.3 
Conventional steam cracking uses fossil 
fuels as the main energy source for heat. 
This stage accounts for 20 to 25 percent 
of emissions from plastics.

3.  Polymerization and product 

manufacturing. The monomers are then 
combined to form the larger molecules 
(polymers) that make up the final plastic 
resin, which is melted, molded, cooled, 
and hardened to create end products. 

The polymerization process and product 
manufacturing account for 10 to 
15 percent of emissions.

4.  End of life. Used plastics are either 

disposed of (for example in a landfill, or 
by being incinerated) or recycled. The 
emissions generated depend on how 
plastics are treated at the end of their  
life. In the EU, end-of-life emissions 
account for more than 50 percent of  
all emissions, reflecting the fact that  
more than half of plastics may be 
incinerated, releasing additional CO2 
that would otherwise remain trapped in 
the product for a long period.4 Globally, 
the share of emissions from end-of-
life treatment is much lower—about 
10 percent by some estimates—because 
incineration is less frequent, and 
landfilling is more common. 5

 Upstream oil and gas extraction and transportation operations are not included. 
 See Industrial transformation 2050—pathways to net-zero emissions from EU heavy industry, Material Economics, October 2019. All emissions figures are taken from this report, 
which examines CO2 emissions from the production of plastics and their end-of-life handling, both of which would need to be abated for the industry to achieve net-zero emissions. 
The extraction of oil and gas, the processing of polymers into finished plastic products, and the use phase of plastics are beyond the scope of this analysis. The outlined process 
in Exhibit 32 shows the production of plastics from naphtha from crude oil, which is the most common feedstock in the EU today. Processes involving other feedstocks would have 
different emissions footprints.

 Ibid.  
 Incineration accounts for most end-of-life emissions, but landfilling and recycling also generate emissions. See Examining material evidence: The carbon fingerprint, Imperial 
College London, October 2020.

New heat sources and CCUS could abate emissions from fossil-fuel-based processes,  
but both are at an early stage in plastics
Substituting fossil fuels as a source of heat with new alternative heat sources or deploying CCUS 
technologies could help lower emissions in plastics production processes that retain fossil fuels in 
their role as an input feedstock. Three approaches could be used. The first two—electrifying heat 
and using alternative fuels—would both avoid fossil fuels being burned to produce heat, thereby 
reducing emissions. The third approach, using CCUS, would capture any emissions arising from 
using fossil fuels for heat generation. In all three approaches, fossil fuels would still be used as the 
input feedstock, and the plastics produced would be identical in both makeup and performance to 
existing ones. What would vary is how heat is generated for the different steps and how any resulting 
emissions are managed.

The three options differ in their maturity and in how much asset reconfiguration they would  
entail. Electrifying heating could be used in steam cracking (the stage that accounts for  
most fossil-fuel heat emissions) through electric crackers (e-crackers).453 However, e-crackers 
face a number of obstacles. First, technologies have not been deployed commercially and  
are as yet untested at scale. Only small projects, including demonstrations being developed  
in Amsterdam since 2022, have been attempted.454 Second, they require access to low-emissions 
power either from the grid or from dedicated generation capacity, such as renewables.455

Given that plastics production is highly energy-intensive, small-scale nuclear technologies could 
be an option in some instances.456 Third, they would require retrofitting of current fossil-fuel-based 
assets, such as replacing the gas burners on the inside walls of the furnace with electric heating 
elements.457 The size of such retrofits is contingent on the specific electrification technology 
deployed. For instance, resistance heating would likely require smaller retrofits than induction 
heating or electric arcs. Retrofitting can also include rewiring the steam balance of the plant, which 
can be a substantial task. 

Instead of electrification, a second possibility to decarbonize the heat production in furnaces would 
be to use low-emissions hydrogen or biomass as fuel. This approach would require less retrofitting. 
In the case of biomass, its use as a source of heat in industry is more established, although it hasn’t 
been deployed in plastics manufacturing to any significant degree. The main limitation of this 
approach is securing sufficient biomass and hydrogen, which in the latter case requires solving  
the interdependency with hydrogen’s own challenges (see chapter 10). 

Both electrification and alternative fuels would contribute to abating emissions from the burning of 
fossil fuels but would not, in and of themselves, address other emissions related to the use of fossil 
fuels as feedstocks for plastics (for example, emissions related to end-of-life combustion).

These approaches have another drawback, too—the need to find a use for the hydrogen and 
methane formed as byproducts during the cracking process. In the conventional steam cracking 
process, these byproducts are burned as fuel. But as part of the decarbonization of cracking through 
electrification and alternative fuels, other uses for those byproducts would need to be found, since 
burning them would continue to generate emissions. This would require setting up the infrastructure 
and logistics required to ensure that these byproducts can be used elsewhere in the facility or 
provided to the market, and that they do not result in additional emissions. For example, one option 
could be an additional build-out of assets, such as an autothermal reforming reactor coupled with 
CCUS, in order to convert methane byproduct into hydrogen and capture CO2 emissions generated in 
the process.458

A third approach to decarbonizing existing processes would be to deploy carbon capture for 
emissions arising from fossil-fuel combustion. This approach would face several barriers. First, 
low concentrations of CO2 in exhaust gases are more difficult to capture than high concentrations 
(see chapter 11). Second, exhaust gases may also be contaminated with other byproducts and may 
therefore need an additional step to remove contaminants. Finally, the CO2 that is captured then 
would need to be stored or used. 

Despite these limitations, the deployment of CCUS is being explored in two different stages of 
the plastics life cycle where its use could be comparatively easier. The first is refining when CO2 
concentrations are higher than 80 percent. The second is the intermediate synthesis stage, during 
the cracking process, which, because it tends to occur in the vicinity of industrial hubs with other 
heavy emitters, could mean that the infrastructure build-out for a CCUS hub could be more efficient. 
Nonetheless, to date, there is limited practical experience with this approach because CCUS in the 
production of plastics is under development and not yet at commercial scale.459

Overall, electrification, alternative fuels, and carbon capture face difficulties in relation to 
technological maturity, such as ensuring that e-cracking and CCUS approaches deliver the required 
performance in an industrial setting; asset reconfiguration that would be required; access to required 
inputs; and addressing interdependencies with other hard challenges (such as hydrogen and carbon 
capture, discussed in chapters 10 and 11, respectively).

Alternative feedstocks could directly replace fossil-based feedstocks but would entail  
significant asset reconfiguration 
Biobased or synthetic materials could replace fossil fuels as feedstocks for the production of 
plastics. These approaches have in common that they replace fossil-fuel use as a material input but 
result in a chemically identical plastic. At the same time, they differ in important respects, including 
the degree of asset transformation required to accommodate new feedstock, how mature the

processes using them are, how easily the required inputs for feedstock would be to secure, and 
how much they would cost. 

Finally, the reduction of emissions over a full life cycle, relative to traditional fossil-fuel feedstocks, 
would significantly depend on the type of plastic being produced and the specific alternative 
feedstock used to produce it. For instance, biopolyethylene derived from plant material would 
have lower emissions than fossil-fuel-derived polyethylene. Nonetheless, there is a wide range of 
estimates of the potential for abatement of different feedstock options.460

Using biobased or synthetic materials entails capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and converting 
it into feedstocks for new plastics. Consider biobased feedstocks. Here, CO2 in the atmosphere is 
first sequestered when the biomass (such as sugar cane) is growing. Biobased feedstocks, such as 
bioethanol and bionaphtha, are then produced using this biomass. In the case of synthetic feedstocks 
(also called CO2-to-X), CO2 in the atmosphere is first captured and then combined with low-emissions 
hydrogen to produce a synthetic feedstock, an example being e-methanol (see Sidebar 10, “Different 
alternative feedstocks have different trade-offs”).461

Converting bio or synthetic feedstock into plastics monomers could have an additional advantage. In 
some cases, synthesis can be achieved at lower temperatures, which would make it easier to replace 
fossil fuels in heat generation. For instance, the dehydration process used to produce ethylene from 
bioethanol can be carried out below 500°C, compared with about 850°C in steam cracking.462

Sidebar 10. Different  
alternative feedstocks have  
different trade-offs

Many different potential bio or synthetic 
feedstocks for plastics could be used, which 
entail different trade-offs in technological 
maturity, required asset reconfiguration, and 
economics. Below, three example feedstocks 
are discussed.

 — Bioethanol. This is produced by 

fermenting sugar and transforming it into 
ethylene. The steam cracking process 
is replaced with a dehydration process. 
This technology is well developed and 
proven on a commercial scale. However, 
significant reconfigurations of the 
existing traditional production asset base 

would be required, since the dehydration 
process uses different equipment from 
existing crackers. 

 — Bionaphtha. Bionaphtha can be 

produced either as a byproduct in the 
manufacturing of hydrotreated vegetable 
oil (HVO) or through the pyrolysis of 
biomass.1 Production of bionaphtha from 
HVO is a commercialized technology, 
while biomass pyrolysis is still in its 
early development phase. The use of 
bionaphtha as a feedstock for plastics 
could be limited by competition for its use 
from other higher-value use cases, such 
as aviation fuel.

 — E-methanol. This is an example of a 
synthetic feedstock. It is formed by 
combining hydrogen with CO2 and then 

using a methane-to-olefins process to 
produce ethylene. This approach faces 
three main barriers. First, e-methanol 
inputs—both biogenic CO2 and low-
emissions hydrogen—have limited 
availability.2 Second, it hasn’t been 
deployed at scale. At the time of writing, 
almost no e-methanol is produced, 
although projects are expected to come 
online by 2025.3 Finally, significant 
reconfigurations of the existing production 
assets would be required, since the 
methane-to-olefins process uses different 
equipment from existing crackers. 

The emissions profile of these approaches 
varies significantly but is estimated to 
be lower overall than using fossil-fuel 
feedstocks.4 

1  Pyrolysis is the heating of an organic material, such as biomass, in the absence of oxygen.
2  The source of the captured carbon would influence the overall footprint of methanol. To maximize the abatement potential of e-methanol, biogenic CO2 point-sources (CO2 

released as a result of combustion or decomposition of biomass and its derivatives) or direct air capture would be needed.

The availability of bio and synthetic feedstocks may be constrained given that there will be 
competition for them during the energy transition.463 Using biobased feedstock would entail 
balancing competing uses for land and water. Synthetic feedstock production may offer higher  
output per unit of land than biomass, and it could be an option over the long term.464 However, 
technological maturity is lower, and securing the required inputs (both captured carbon and 
hydrogen) requires cracking interdependencies with the hard challenges of carbon capture 
and hydrogen. Currently, synthetic feedstock production, which can be energy-intensive and 
require advanced technologies, can also be far more expensive than traditional fossil-fuel-based 
feedstocks.465 Finally, a large amount of asset reconfiguration could be needed in both biobased 
feedstocks and synthetic feedstocks, given the different processes and equipment used—for 
instance, replacing the cracker process with a dehydration process in the case of bioethanol.

Recycling plastics would cut the need for fossil-fuel feedstocks, but scale would rely on  
additional infrastructure and innovation 
Recycling involves breaking down plastic end products, either mechanically into polymer resin  
or chemically into the base monomer.466 Both can be used to create more plastic products or even 
the chemical feedstock for new plastics production, and therefore reduce the need for new fossil-
fuel feedstock. 

Today, less than 10 percent of the plastics produced uses recycled plastics, and increasing that 
share would require overcoming a number of hurdles.467 For example, additional investment would 
be needed to improve the collection and separation of goods to minimize waste contamination, thus 
improving the quality of recycled materials. Behavioral change among consumers (which is beyond 
the scope of this research) is also important. If consumers increased their collection and sorting of 
plastic waste, the availability of that waste for recycling would accelerate. 

There are two main plastic recycling approaches, which have different advantages and drawbacks in 
how mature they are and the performance of the resulting products. 

 — Mechanical recycling. This uses mechanical processes to convert plastic waste into new 

plastics without changing the chemical structure of the material. It is a mature and common 
process, having initially been scaled in the 1970s.468 Furthermore, the process of mechanically 
recycling plastics is relatively easy to decarbonize, because it relies on low-temperature heat and 
mechanical power, both of which can be electrified.469 The main physical issue with this process 
pertains to constraints on its scale-up, given that sufficient feedstock may not be available and 
that recycled plastics can currently be used only in limited ways. Mechanical recycling relies on 
high-quality, relatively clean, sorted waste to be effective. Yet today it is still difficult to separate 
components of multilaminated products, such as some food and beverage packaging, plastic 
pipes, automotive parts, and medical devices. Furthermore, the properties of plastic waste being 
recycled and the recycling process itself limit the number of times a plastic can be mechanically 
recycled and limit potential use cases. Recycled plastics don’t exhibit the same performance as 
new ones. For example, using mechanically recycled plastics in food-grade materials is likely to 
remain difficult because of safety concerns about contaminants. As a result, while mechanical 
recycling rates could scale up significantly, there are limits to how large a share of total plastics 
production recycling could ever reach.470

 — Chemical recycling. Chemical recycling converts a wide range of mixed materials into 

hydrocarbons and precursors that can later be used as chemical feedstocks for plastics 
production. Processes include gasification and pyrolysis. Chemical recycling has an advantage 
over mechanical recycling because it offers more flexibility in which plastics can be recycled. It 
can be an option for plastics that are not suitable for mechanical recycling, such as mixed polymer 
flows, aged or contaminated plastics, and thermosets or fiber-reinforced plastics.471 Moreover, 
it does not limit the number of times the plastic can be recycled, since the recycled plastic is 
equivalent to virgin plastic and delivers identical performance.

However, chemical recycling is less technologically mature than the mechanical route. Large-
scale trials have been undertaken since the 1990s, and many, largely proven technologies exist, 
including gasification and pyrolysis, but deployment on a commercial scale has been limited. One 
consideration is that chemical recycling requires more inputs than mechanical recycling, including 
power (with large variation in how much is used, from one to seven megawatt-hours per tonne, 
depending on the plastic) and low-emissions hydrogen in the case of gasification technology.472 
Further research is needed to ascertain the environmental impact and toxicity of hazardous 
chemicals used in the process.473

Overall, then, almost all plastics recycling is still done mechanically rather than chemically.474  
That being said, some commercial-scale facilities do operate, including, for instance, the 
production of PEX pipes in Finland using plastics chemically recycled via pyrolysis.475 New 
capacity has increased substantially, from 200,000 tonnes per year in 2020 to one million in 
2023. Projects that could add eight million tonnes per year by 2027 are ongoing.476

Substituting plastics with other materials in products is an option, but the feasibility and  
abatement potential vary by use case 
In some cases, it may be feasible to substitute plastic with metal, wood, ceramics, glass, paper, or 
fabric in a wide variety of end markets from construction to packaging. In the EU, for instance, it is 
estimated that up to 25 percent of plastics currently used in packaging could be substituted with 
fiber-based alternatives without compromising functionality.477

In some cases, biobased replacement materials could be used that do not rely on fossil fuels, such as 
biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates and polyhydroxybutyrates.478 These materials are inherently 
different from conventional plastics, display different physical properties, and are produced in a 
different way. This means that producing them entails large asset reconfigurations. Deploying new 
equipment and processes would be needed, and supply chains would have to be reconfigured. In this 
way, deploying these materials goes well beyond simply replacing feedstocks in existing processes.

How much emissions abatement these materials might offer also differs by application, production 
route, downstream processing considerations, and their duration or lifetime in use relative to 
conventional plastics. Overall, substitutes for plastics should be assessed case by case.479 In many 
applications, substitutes could result in higher emissions than plastics, taking into account both 
direct and indirect emissions throughout the life cycle.480

§ § §

This is a Level 3 challenge. Decarbonizing plastics is hard because fossil fuels are integral to their 
production, both as their primary feedstock and as a source of the high-temperature heat required. 
Almost no low-emissions primary plastic production exists today. Decarbonizing plastics would 
require deploying several currently available technologies that could reduce emissions, including 
increasing mechanical recycling and using biobased feedstocks, plastics substitutes, or alternative 
fuels. However, these approaches are limited in how much they can scale. Additional innovation of 
other required low-emissions technologies would be needed. Examples include e-crackers, which 
are still not deployed on a commercial scale, and chemical recycling. Furthermore, decarbonizing 
plastics would require a large asset transformation to retrofit existing sites as well as the scaling of 
access to important inputs such as biobased feedstocks, hydrogen, and low-emissions power.

Challenge 16

Challenge 16: Heating other industries (Level 2)
Coauthored with Ken Somers 

Decarbonizing industrial heat is central to reducing the emissions of the entire industry sector. Heat 
represents about 55 percent of industrial energy demand and 20 percent of overall final energy 
demand globally.481

For the big four materials discussed earlier in this chapter, high-temperature heat is key, and 
delivering it using low-emissions processes often requires extensive reconfigurations of existing 
assets and deploying technologies that have not yet been proven at scale. But a large number of 
other industries require relatively lower-temperature heat, broadly speaking, and may therefore be 
comparatively easier to decarbonize. These include food processing, papermaking, and other general 
manufacturing sectors. These other industries account for more than half of total industrial energy 
demand and generate about 12 percent of the total global CO2 emissions of the energy system.

Across industries (including the big four), where low- or medium-temperature heat is needed, 
efficient and widespread low-emissions heating technologies are already commercially available 
today. Therefore, the major physical challenge is not a lack of technological options but the sheer 
scale of deployment that would be required. The big issue is the extent to which existing assets 
would need to be overhauled across economies. In the EU alone, there are more than two million 
manufacturing enterprises, giving a sense of the breadth of the effort that would need to  
be undertaken.482

Decarbonizing industrial heat in other industries requires broader deployment of  
mature technologies
Around 50 percent of the heat used in these other industries relies directly on the combustion 
of fossil fuels, with the rest coming from electricity or alternative fuels.483 Decarbonizing these 
industries would thus require replacing the use of fossil fuels by electrification or alternative fuels. 

Electrification of these industries could be easier, because they rely on comparatively lower 
temperatures than is the case in the large industrial materials discussed. Some 90 percent of the  
heat demanded by these other industries is of low to medium temperatures (below 500°C). For 
example, 86 percent of energy consumption for heating in food processing, and 98 percent in paper, 
wood, and pulp production, requires temperatures below 500°C. The one exception is nonferrous 
metals, such as aluminum (Exhibit 33).484 In comparison, the clinkerization process in cement requires 
heat of above 1,500°C. 

Heat represents about 55 percent 
of industrial energy demand 
and 20 percent of overall final 
energy demand globally.

consumption is categorized by the temperature requirements for both thermal and mechanical energy. High-temperature heat supports processes like smelting 
and chemical reactions, medium-temperature heat is used in drying and other moderate-temperature processes and often for mechanical energy demands, and 
low-temperature heat is applied for pre-heating or maintaining specific conditions. Mechanical energy demands, such as compression work, are typically met by 
steam turbines or electric motors.

Electrification of heat sources could abate emissions and is already feasible 
Significant decarbonization of these other industries would require the current source of heat to 
be replaced, including by direct electrification of low- to medium-temperature heat processes. 
This is already feasible because the relevant technologies are mature and available. Electric heat 
pumps for low- and medium- temperature heat are already used on industrial sites, such as for food 
processing and drying lumber in sawmills. Mechanical vapor recompression evaporators, which 
are used to separate liquids from solutions, are more efficient than their predecessors and are now 
standard for new evaporators in China.485 And for areas where heat energy is being used not to raise 
temperatures, but to produce steam that is in turn used to perform mechanical tasks, electric drives 
could be used instead.

These technologies would enable a considerable share of heating demand in other industries—the 
90 percent that uses low to medium heat—to be electrified, but deployment would need to be

stepped up. In the food and tobacco industry, for instance, electricity accounts for 29 percent of 
total final energy consumption, but in McKinsey’s Achieved Commitments scenario, this would 
need to increase to 53 percent by 2050.486

The remaining 10 percent of heat demand that requires very high temperatures in other 
industries—for instance, glass and ceramics production—may require more innovation. It is 
potentially promising that, over time, electrification technologies have been deployed successfully 
for an ever-widening range of temperatures (see Sidebar 11, “Electrifying industrial high-
temperature heat—the next frontier”).

Alternative heat sources could complement electrification
Other sources of heat could be deployed alongside electrification, including nuclear, geothermal, 
concentrated solar power, and biomass. Many of these alternative heat sources build on existing 
technologies, and some reuse waste heat that is already being produced for other goals such as 
power generation.487

Nuclear-based heat generation is being used as a heat source in chemical complexes in China.488 
New approaches are emerging in nuclear-generated heat, including the use of spent fuel rods 
that can no longer function in reactors to produce medium-temperature heat for a couple of years 
and low-temperature heat thereafter.489 Geothermal is an option capable of generating heat up 
to 200°C.490 A startup in Germany is working on deep geothermal closed-loop systems that can 
provide both heating and electrical power with full operational capacity and are expected in 2026.491 
Concentrated solar power is also being used to generate low-temperature heat alongside electrical 
power. One example of the successful implementation of this technology for industrial heat demand 
is in Oman. The primary obstacle to deploying these alternative heat sources has to do with the 
reconfiguration needed to reorient industrial processes to leverage them. Biomass is the exception, 
in that it would require the least amount of asset reconfiguration, but it faces competition for its use, 
as discussed in other sections of this chapter. 

Some new technologies could also play a role but are less mature. They include steam explosion 
processing, which could turn cellulosic biomass into a material similar to coal, which could, in turn, be 
used in existing coal infrastructure or be further processed into syngas.492

Sidebar 11. Electrifying  
industrial high-temperature 
heat—the next frontier

The range of electric technologies 
that can produce heat for industrial 
production is expanding. Four main groups 
of technologies are being developed: 
(1) heat pumps; (2) resistive heating; 
(3) electromagnetic heating; and (4) arc-
based technologies. All of these can 
convert electricity into heat at efficiencies 

of 90 to 99 percent—300 percent plus in 
the case of heat pumps—at a wide range 
of temperatures.1 In the case of low- and 
medium-temperature applications, 
deployment of electric-based technologies is 
already widespread. 

Electric technologies had long been 
considered unsuitable for producing high-
temperature heat, but new applications 
have been emerging, albeit mostly nascent 
and deployed only at small scale. McKinsey 
analysis suggests that about 80 percent of 
the heat demand for temperatures above 

1,000°C could be met by electric-based 
technologies.2 However, the majority of 
this demand would rely on technologies 
that are only in early development—in the 
R&D, prototype, or pilot project phase.3 
Example technologies include electric 
furnaces used in float glass manufacturing. 
Other examples of high-temperature heat 
being generated with electric technologies 
include e-crackers used in petrochemical 
manufacturing (as discussed in the plastics 
section) and electric kilns (as discussed in 
the cement section).

Electrification of heat could create additional flexibility in power systems
Beyond helping to decarbonize industrial processes, electrification could contribute to making the 
entire energy system more stable. Electrifying heat production in industry creates a new source of 
power demand that could be used to enhance demand-side flexibility in the power system. Such 
flexibility could, in some cases, be achieved by pairing electrification with backup sources that can 
provide heat at times when demand on the grid is higher. One example could be dual-fuel heating 
systems in which heating can switch to be provided by a backup gas furnace. Another example is 
TES, which stores excess heat to use later. When demand for electricity is high, industrial plants 
could scale down their call on the power system by leveraging either stored heat or alternative 
heating sources. 

A particular advantage of TES is its efficiency. Storing heat can have round-trip efficiencies of more 
than 90 percent. In comparison, storing power often results in round-trip efficiency of less than 
60 percent.493

Scaling TES could rely in part on technologies that are already commercially available and could 
relatively easily be deployed and integrated with existing systems—for example, providing heat for 
medium-pressure steam generation—among the most common forms of heat used in industrial 
processes in, say, the chemicals and food and beverage industries. Other forms of TES, such as 
chemical reaction storage and absorption, are still in the early stages of deployment. 

§ § §

This is a Level 2 challenge. Decarbonizing other industries would require broader deployment 
of mature technologies, namely low- and medium-temperature heating, both electric (such as 
industrial heat pumps) and based on other fuels (such as biomass). This would require a large asset 
transformation, given the millions of individual manufacturing sites spread globally. Despite overall 
technological approaches being mature, some additional innovation will still be needed to address 
the tail end of high-temperature use cases. While these challenges are hard to overcome, this 
transformation could also bring about new opportunities. Electrification can often be cost-effective. 
Electrifying industrial processes can also open up new forms of flexible demand, for example, when 
used with thermal energy storage.

Heat storage can have  
round-trip efficiencies of more  
than 90 percent, compared  
to less than 60 percent for  
power storage.

Note: This research examines 25 significant physical challenges in seven domains at the core of the energy transition, categorized in three levels. 
Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require the deployment of known 
technologies to accelerate, and associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological performance 
(often with demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning. The focus is on physical realities because they influence 
the ability to design an interdependent system that has performance comparable to that of the current system and to reduce emissions feasibly. These factors 
influence cost and affordability. Nonphysical factors—notably cost—are important but are not the focus of this research. Assessment of required deployment of 
technologies primarily draws on McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, which assumes that countries that have committed to net zero (some by 
2050, some later) meet those commitments, and in which warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. This scenario is used because it provides 
sufficient regional and sectoral granularity for assessing required deployment. In some instances, this research also uses scenarios from other sources for reasons 
of data availability.

The heating and cooling needs of buildings—the focus of this chapter—account for almost 85 percent 
of total CO2 emitted from buildings, with space heating and water heating responsible for more than 
75 percent.494 The vast majority of buildings emissions are produced on-site through the combustion 
of fossil fuels, for example in gas boilers.495 The rest of buildings emissions come from electricity that 
is used for lighting, powering appliances, and, to a lesser extent, cooking.496

Decarbonizing heating and cooling in buildings would entail deploying a variety of low-emissions 
technologies. Electrification is the main approach being considered, and heat pumps are the primary 
tool for heating and, to some extent, cooling spaces as well as heating water.497

Overall, about 10 percent of the deployment of heat pumps required in the IEA’s Net Zero scenario by 
2050 has been achieved.498 By 2050, the number of heat pumps installed in buildings would have to 
scale by around 9 times, from about 200 million today to around 1.8 billion. Sales of heat pumps have 
reached about 10 percent of the annual sales that would be required in 2050 in McKinsey’s 2023 
Achieved Commitments scenario. In this scenario, the global share of heat provided by electricity in 
households would increase from about 15 percent today to 65 percent by 2050.499

Some of the heating buildings need could come from other low-emissions solutions, such as electric 
resistance heaters, district heating, solar thermal technology, and electric or hydrogen boilers.500 
The size of the overall need for heating could also be reduced by improving energy efficiency through 
better insulation, for instance. Expanding energy efficiency is Challenge 23.

This chapter focuses on heat pumps because they are expected to play the largest role of any 
technology in decarbonizing heating in buildings. The two key physical challenges analyzed relating 
to the future deployment of heat pumps are (1) facing the cold with heat pumps; and (2) managing 
peaks in electricity demand in winter. 

The first is a Level 1 challenge, defined as requiring progress in deploying established technologies 
with the least hurdles. It involves ensuring that heat pumps perform sufficiently to meet use cases 
even where temperatures are coldest and average heat pump efficiency declines. The second is 
characterized as a Level 2 challenge that requires that the deployment of known technologies 
accelerates and that associated infrastructure and inputs scale. As heat pump penetration rises, 
more people would turn on their heat pumps at the same time, and peaks in the use of electricity in 
the winter would become more pronounced. Transformation would therefore be needed in the way 
the power system works, and managing demand peaks would require new technologies. 

The 1.8 billion heat pumps that would be needed for all buildings in 2050 would have other 
operational challenges that are not discussed in this research. They include the need to scale up 
manufacturing capacity for heat pumps, whether sufficient skilled labor is available to install them, 
whether consumers adopt them given their associated costs, and the large turnover that their 
installation would entail.501

Challenge 17: Facing the cold with heat pumps (Level 1)
Heat pumps can be a highly energy-efficient way to heat buildings.502 They work by extracting heat 
from the air, the ground, or water bodies such as rivers and ponds, and then moving it to the areas that 
need it. There are different varieties, but air-source heat pumps (ASHPs), which transfer heat from 
outside air to the interior of buildings, are the most common.503 Different types of ASHPs are used 
globally, and their sales have been rising.504 Globally, sales of heat pumps have grown 30 percent 
per year since 2020.505 In Europe, for example, sales of air-to-water heat pumps jumped by almost 
50 percent in 2022. Such heat pumps can more readily be integrated with existing water-circulation-
based heating systems, such as radiators and underfloor heating systems. In the United States, 
heat pump sales overtook gas furnace sales in 2022. Most US residential units are air-to-air models 
in ducted air systems. Nonetheless, in 2023 global sales of heat pumps decreased by 3 percent, 
although not uniformly. In the US sales declined by about 15 percent and in the European Union by 
about 5 percent, while in China they increased by 12 percent.506

The efficiency of a heat pump is measured by the coefficient of performance (COP), which typically 
ranges from two to five for heat pumps, meaning that for every unit of electrical energy consumed, 
the heat pump is able to deliver two to five units of heat.507 In comparison, the energy efficiency of a 
natural gas furnace is about 80 to 97 percent, and 95 to 100 percent in the case of electric resistance 
heating (meaning that for a unit of energy consumed, they deliver less than a unit of energy in the form 
of heat).508

In cold temperatures, more heat is needed, but heat pumps have to work harder to deliver it
Demand for heating is naturally higher in regions that experience colder temperatures. In the United 
States, for instance, the 40 percent of people living in regions where average winter temperatures are 
below freezing account for 60 percent of residential heating energy consumed (Exhibit 34).509

It is critical to understand the ability of heat pumps to supply heat to populations living in colder 
climates given that they require the most heat. ASHPs in particular can struggle to meet higher 
demand for heat in colder climates for the following two reasons:

 — Lower heating capacity. As it gets colder and there is less heat in the air outside the building, the 
total amount of heat an ASHP can deliver drops. This is also true for ground-source heat pumps 
(GSHPs) when the ground cools, although underground temperatures fluctuate only slightly 
during the year.510 As temperatures fall below freezing, most ASHPs currently on the market start 
operating at less than their full capacity.511 As temperatures continue to drop, they may be unable 
to deliver enough heat to meet households’ needs.512

 — Lower heating efficiency. When it is cold and, by definition, there is less heat in the air, ASHPs 
have to work harder to deliver the same amount of heat, and their efficiency can decline. For 
example, when temperatures drop from 5ºC to minus 10ºC, the COP of standard heat pumps 
almost halves.513 At temperatures of around minus 10°C and minus 15°C, the COP of a standard 
ASHP may drop below two (Exhibit 35).514 In such cases, the efficiency of heat pumps could be 
roughly equivalent to that of gas furnaces.515 Heating efficiency is all the more important because 
some regions and economies have high electricity costs, and such efficiency declines could mean 
that the economic business case for heat pumps in comparison with gas furnaces is more difficult 
to make.

Of course, the extent to which heating capacity and efficiency drop depends on a specific heat 
pump’s model and size, as well as the conditions of the home where it is installed (such as floor area 
and insulation). In general, research finds that at temperatures of between minus 10°C and minus 
15°C, the performance of many standard ASHPs drops substantially. In some cases, heating capacity 
may even fall below needed levels.516 At such temperatures, studies find that specialized cold-climate 
ASHPs could offer an alternative. As temperatures continue to drop and reach below minus 20°C to 
minus 25°C, even specialized heat pumps may be unable to deliver heat effectively.

Standard heat pumps deliver most of the heating needed but are currently not suitable for  
the most extreme use cases
Populations that regularly experience extremely cold winter temperatures may have issues with 
standard heat pumps and may need specialized cold-climate ASHPs to ensure more efficient heating 
at these low temperatures. To understand the degree to which this is an issue, this research considers 
the minimum outdoor temperatures that different people experience on the coldest day of the year. 

This analysis finds that about 1.2 billion people—some 15 percent of the global population—live 
in regions that experience minimum temperatures below about minus 10°C to minus 15°C at 
least once per year. About 400 million people, or some 5 percent of the world’s population, 
experience minimum daily temperatures below about minus 20°C to minus 25°C at least once 
a year (Exhibit 36).517 Overall, therefore, most people live in regions with minimum temperatures 
above about minus 10°C to minus 15°C, where standard ASHPs are able to meet heating needs 
and deliver high performance. However, for those experiencing minimum temperatures below that 
range, standard heat pumps alone may not suffice.

Innovation and alternative technologies could help address the most demanding use cases
Even with today’s technologies, it is possible to meet the heating needs of regions with extreme 
cold climates effectively—with top-performing, rather than standard, cold-climate ASHPs. New 
generations of top-performing cold-climate ASHPs have COPs greater than two at temperatures 
far below freezing and can even provide uninterrupted heat at temperatures below minus 20°C to 
minus 25°C.518 While this is not yet the case for most ASHPs on the market today, recent initiatives 
have been launched to further improve ASHP performance at these lower temperatures. For 
instance, the US Department of Energy’s Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge 
encourages industrial players to develop higher-performance heat pumps.519 As part of this initiative, 
the department set target specifications for residential cold-climate heat pumps to be operational at 
minus 26°C and have a COP of 2.1 to 2.4 at minus 15°C.520

Other heat pump technologies could also provide heat efficiently where temperatures are extremely 
low, although they have some challenges to overcome. For instance, GSHPs could be more effective 
than ASHPs; they use established technologies that can have COPs of four even at the very lowest 
temperatures.521 However, GSHPs are more difficult to install, it takes longer to do so, and they 
require more-specialized labor and more space because land needs to be dug up to install them.522 
Another option would be to have a source of backup heat on the coldest days, such as backup electric 
resistance heating or a dual-fuel system, which is a hybrid heat pump that retains a gas furnace in 
parallel with a heat pump. Of course, this option would add to the cost and the space needed and 
could lead to residual emissions.523

The performance of heat pumps has already been increasing by about 2 percent a year, and further 
improvements are likely.524 Overall, penetration of different types of heat pumps is rising, especially 
in cold climates. Norway, one of the coldest economies in the world, has an overall penetration rate of 
about 60 percent of the stock of all buildings, one of the highest rates in the world.525 Penetration of 
heat pumps in buildings in Finland, which regularly sees winter temperatures as low as minus 35°C, 
has reached more than 40 percent.526 Adoption of heat pumps in Finland has significant momentum, 
with heat pump sales increasing by 50 percent year over year in 2022.527

§ § §

Ensuring that heat pumps can cover use cases at extremely cold temperatures effectively and 
efficiently is a Level 1 challenge. The vast majority of use cases can already be met by today’s 
typical heat pumps. However, average heat pumps have lower efficiencies at low temperatures, and 
as a result, there are still some use cases not served by typical ASHPs. Additional technological 
innovations would be needed, including innovation related to alternative heat pumps, such as 
specialized cold-climate heat pumps, as well as deploying GSHPs, which is not as easy operationally 
as deploying ASHPs. Nevertheless, rapid progress has been made in delivering low-emissions 
heating in buildings and improving performance. Even in extremely cold temperatures, heat pump 
penetration is increasing. 

Challenge 18: Bracing for winter peaks (Level 2)
As heating in buildings electrifies with the use of heat pumps and other technologies, demand for 
electricity will, of course, increase (together with increased demand from other parts of the energy 
system, including industry and mobility). But higher demand for electricity is only part of the story. 
Peaks in that demand at specific times of the year (or day) create a distinct physical challenge. People 
in a particular region tend to want heat at the same time, during the coldest hours of the coldest 
days of the year. Meeting that peak demand necessarily involves a system that has plenty of spare 
capacity—like a passenger train that needs to be large enough to accommodate busy rush hours 
but may be nearly empty for much of the day. The world needs a larger power system not only to 
support the electrification of heating in buildings and other domains but also because it needs to 
have flexibility built in for these peaks. This is not a new problem—the same challenge regarding peak 
usage appeared in the case of air conditioning during summers in the United States in the 1950s.528 
Now the system needs to adjust again as use of heat pumps rises. 

Power systems need to scale up significantly to meet winter peaks in demand
In the United States, about 30 percent of space heating energy is electrified today, and some 
estimates suggest that this share could rise to about 50 percent without exceeding the current peak 
loads of the existing grid.529 This is partly because the current system already has spare capacity 
to cope with existing peaks in demand, which today occur in the summer mostly due to the use of 
air conditioning in many states.530 It is also because legacy systems across the United States are 
moving from less-efficient resistance heaters to heat pumps. However, if heat pumps spread, at some 
point peak power demand would be higher than today and would shift from typically occurring in the 
summer to happening in the winter. 

External research has estimated that, in a hypothetical scenario in which heat for buildings is fully 
electrified, every other source of demand is held constant, and no additional measures to balance 
supply and demand are put in place, the US power system peak demand could be 1.7 times today’s 
peaks (Exhibit 37).531 In colder parts of the country, such as New England, peak demand could be 
about three times today’s peaks.532 Other analyses, including studies by McKinsey, ISO–NE, and 
others, have found similar values of potential growth in peak demand of about two to three times in 
colder states in a range of different potential decarbonization scenarios.533

The key challenge, then, would be to transform the energy system so that it can manage such 
increases in peak demand while avoiding building a massively oversize and often underutilized power 
system. This would entail transforming how, and how much, energy is delivered to heat buildings, 
addressing interdependences involved in scaling up the power system, and implementing new 
technological solutions.

Various measures are being explored to reduce the extent to which peak capacity load  
needs to increase 
Part of the solution to these demand peaks could, of course, be to increase the capacity of the power 
system. However, doing so could lead to an oversize power system—able to accommodate peaks, but 
at the cost of keeping significant unused capacity sitting idle for most of the year. 

Four levers could be used to reduce the peak demand the power system has to accommodate, and 
the mix of the four could well shift over time. Many of them come with their own implementation 
issues, such as required asset retrofits and effective integration of different technologies, which 
would need to be overcome if the peak demand challenge is to be addressed.

 — Continuing to innovate technology of heat pumps. Improving the COP of heat pumps, particularly 
at lower temperatures, would reduce the amount of power needed, especially in cold-climate 
systems. If the US Department of Energy targets for the improvement of heat pump performance 
(noted earlier) were met, research estimates that the United States could potentially electrify 
up to 75 percent of heating without having to increase the current peak capacity of the power 
system.534 Some manufacturers have already succeeded in prototyping models that meet the 
department’s challenge.535

 — Creating efficiency and flexibility in managing demand. More-efficient buildings would reduce 
overall demand for heating, for example through improved insulation and reducing energy loss 
from windows. Technologies like smart thermostats can also help to better manage and adjust 
heating demand. But the potential extends beyond energy efficiency. Demand-management 
strategies could also reduce the peak (coincidental) load—by nearly 40 percent, according to 
some estimates (for a discussion on options for demand-side flexibility, see chapter 5 on the 
power domain).536 In particular, some technologies are developing that could smooth demand 
for power for heating throughout the day and manage peak periods better. For example thermal 
energy storage (TES) is a promising form of long-duration energy storage that could complement 
the electrification of heating. These technologies involve capturing and storing excess heat 
generated during periods of low heating demand and releasing it during periods when demand for 
heating is higher. For instance, heat pumps could generate heat that is stored in TES during the 
warmer part of the day when COPs are higher and power demand is lower; that heat could then be 
used by homes in the coldest parts of the day, thereby alleviating peak demand for power.537 One 
major heat pump manufacturer has announced a heating system that uses an air-to-water heat 
pump and water-based TES.538 However, with little deployment to date, the path forward for TES 
would rely on continued innovation and effective integration into the broader energy system—and 
on consumers to respond positively by changing their behavior.

 — Deploying alternative low-emissions heating solutions. Alternative heating sources that do 

not draw on the power system, such as district heating and solar thermal, could also meet some 
demand. However, these solutions cannot be rolled out in all circumstances.539 For instance, 
district heating requires a central heating source, such as a thermal power plant or surplus heat 
from industry. Solar thermal may not be efficient for geographies with low solar irradiance.

 — Backing up heat pumps with dual-fuel systems. Targeted use of dual-fuel systems for the coldest 
days of the year would lower electricity requirements while still significantly reducing emissions 
in comparison with existing fossil-fuel furnaces. The most common dual-fuel systems have a heat 
pump and a gas furnace; the latter can be used when demand for electricity is high or on very 
cold days when a heat pump alone may struggle to meet demand. Some utilities are starting to 
explore and promote dual-fuel systems. For example, utilities in Quebec have partnered with one 
another to convert customers to dual-fuel systems, and they plan to use heat pumps for more 
than 70 percent of heating needs by 2030.540 Dual-fuel systems could be particularly relevant 
in the short term because they use existing infrastructure. Research cited previously in this 
chapter suggests that in the United States, growth in peak power demand could be avoided with 
a combination of top-performing heat pumps and a very small share of fossil-fuel use in dual-use 
systems—as little as 1 to 3 percent of annual heating energy demand deployed on the coldest 
days.541 In the longer term, as TES and other technologies mature, dual-fuel systems could be 
phased out. While dual-fuel systems could be beneficial, they could complicate installations. This 
is because multiple heating units would need to be installed, which would mean maintaining the 
fossil-fuel infrastructure despite it experiencing limited use.

Managing winter peaks is a Level 2 challenge. A world in which the majority of heat for buildings is 
provided by electricity would increase demand for power on the coldest days. The power system 
would need to be scaled up to accommodate new winter peaks, but accelerating the deployment 
of other technologies and approaches could manage the extent of that scale-up. This includes 
improving the energy efficiency of buildings to reduce energy loss, using TES to smooth demand, 
deploying dual-source heating systems, and upgrading heat pumps to be more effective in colder 
environments. While these come with some implementation challenges, such as retrofitting assets 
and integrating new (often mature) technologies, they present opportunities to reduce the peak 
capacity load on the power system and manage the extent of scale-up needed.

heat for buildings is provided by 
electricity would increase demand

Note: This research examines 25 significant physical challenges in seven domains at the core of the energy transition, categorized in three levels. 
Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require the deployment of known 
technologies to accelerate, and associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological performance 
(often with demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning. The focus is on physical realities because they influence 
the ability to design an interdependent system that has performance comparable to that of the current system and to reduce emissions feasibly. These factors 
influence cost and affordability. Nonphysical factors—notably cost—are important but are not the focus of this research. Assessment of required deployment of 
technologies primarily draws on McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, which assumes that countries that have committed to net zero (some by 
2050, some later) meet those commitments, and in which warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. This scenario is used because it provides 
sufficient regional and sectoral granularity for assessing required deployment. In some instances, this research also uses scenarios from other sources for reasons 
of data availability.

Deploying the billions of low-emissions assets required for the energy transition, from electric 
cars to wind turbines to electrolyzers, would require access to the raw materials that make up their 
components. Many of those raw materials already move around the world in substantial amounts, 
examples being iron ore in the manufacture of steel, limestone for making cement, and wood for 
alternative construction materials.542 However, some materials, notably certain minerals that are 
critical for the low-emissions technologies that will be required to decarbonize many domains, will 
play a disproportionately important role in the transition. Securing these critical minerals is the main 
physical challenge—a Level 2 one—in the raw materials domain and is the focus of this chapter.

Challenge 19: Unearthing critical minerals (Level 2)
Ensuring that sufficient critical minerals are available to support the deployment of low-emissions 
technologies would require a large scale-up of their extraction and refining. These minerals will be 
needed, for instance, to produce batteries, wind turbines, electric motors, and electrolyzers. They are 
a vital enabler of decarbonization across domains.543

The many critical minerals required by the energy transition fall into four major categories related to 
how they are used. 

 — Batteries. Cobalt, graphite, lithium, and nickel, for instance, are used in batteries, such as those 

that power EVs, and for grid-level storage. 

 — Permanent magnets. Many rare earth elements are used in permanent magnets, which are key 

components of, for example, EV motors and wind turbines. 

 — Electrification and infrastructure. Copper and aluminum are used in electrical wiring, 

transmission lines, and transformers, for example. 

 — Other applications. Among other critical minerals are iridium, used in electrolyzers that enable the 

production of hydrogen, and silicon for the manufacture of solar panels. 

The scale-up of critical minerals is still in its early stages. Current supply of critical minerals is 
only about 10 to 35 percent of what would be needed by 2050 under McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved 
Commitments scenario. Both supply expansion and demand management would be needed to bridge 
the gap. 

The key factors that make this challenge difficult are whether sufficient critical minerals will 
be available, and quickly enough, to support the deployment of low-emissions technologies. 
A potential input constraint could arise if the expansion of supply does not occur sufficiently 
fast. Moreover, demand-management approaches, such as technological substitution, remain 
somewhat uncertain, and the implications of these approaches for technological performance 
must be carefully considered. 

Demand for critical minerals is expected to soar as the energy transition progresses
Under McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, demand for seven of the eight 
critical minerals investigated—lithium, cobalt, nickel, dysprosium, terbium, neodymium, and 
praseodymium—could at least double by 2030.544 For example, demand for nickel could double, 
demand for dysprosium and terbium could quadruple, and demand for lithium could increase 
sevenfold. This projected surge in demand is largely related to the needs of the energy transition. 
By 2030, in the Achieved Commitments scenario, low-emissions technologies are expected to 
drive more than 50 percent of demand for many critical minerals, and as much as 80 or 90 percent 
of demand for lithium and rare earth elements like dysprosium, praseodymium, neodymium,  
and terbium.545

The spike in demand is likely to be particularly pronounced in the years to 2030, because this is when 
most new low-emissions technologies would be likely to experience the fastest growth in deployment 
in typical net-zero scenarios. After 2030, demand for these critical minerals is expected to continue 
to grow, but at a slower pace.546

Supply is not projected to grow as fast as demand under the transition, potentially leading  
to imbalances
Considering potential demand and supply across various scenarios, the supply of critical minerals 
is not expected to increase quickly enough to keep pace with the surging demand needs of the 
transition, particularly in the period to 2030. 

McKinsey MineSpans’ base-case supply scenario, which includes operating mines and potential 
new projects (based, for example, on the development stage among other criteria), sees significant 
imbalances between projected supply and the demand that would be required in the Achieved 
Commitments scenario.547 For example, the amount of dysprosium and terbium required could

be 75 percent higher than expected supply by 2030. In the case of lithium, it could be 40 percent 
higher (Exhibit 38). Even when considering potential additional supply sources from announced 
projects in a high-case scenario, there could still be a medium to high supply-demand imbalance in 
four of the eight critical minerals examined.548 This high case includes projects still in the feasibility 
stage without confirmed financing (and where potential delays could also occur and are accounted 
for in the scenario). Reaching this high case of supply is by no means guaranteed, and would rely on 
many conditions being met, including securing the required financing and managing the concurrent 
execution of multiple projects in parallel. Historically, this has not always been achieved.

1McKinsey MineSpans’ base-case of supply includes all operating mines (corrected for depletion and expected closure where relevant), and a selection of projects 
currently under construction or at the feasibility stage, and in most cases with financing confirmed. The high-case of supply includes, for example, some projects 
in feasibility stage and no financing confirmed, with adjustments for potential delays. Note that reaching this high-case of supply is by no means guaranteed, and 
would rely on many conditions being met, including the required financing and concurrent execution of multiple projects in parallel, which has not historically 
always been the case. Potential imbalances between required demand and projected supply are classified into three categories. “High imbalance” corresponds to 
cases in which demand is more than 50% higher than projected supply. “Medium imbalance” corresponds to cases where demand is more than 10% higher than 
supply, but less than 50%. “No or low imbalance” corresponds to cases where demand is less than 10% higher or even lower than supply.

A meta review (as of early 2024) of studies of the supply-demand balance in net-zero scenarios, 
including those from the International Energy Agency, the Energy Transitions Commission, and 
the International Renewable Energy Agency, also reveals that most expect demand-supply 
imbalances.549 The exact size of those imbalances depends on assumptions about how quickly 
low-emissions technologies are deployed, the specific mix of technologies assumed (for example, 
different battery chemistries), and how quickly supply ramps up. Imbalances are expected to be more 
pronounced in the period to 2030 when demand is seen growing fastest, and supply is expected to 
take time to catch up. Thereafter, as demand growth stabilizes and supply has time to come online, 
imbalances could ease. 

This is not to say that imbalances are inevitable, particularly because there are rapid developments 
on both the supply and demand sides. For example, in 2023, the output of some critical minerals 
like lithium, cobalt, and nickel scaled rapidly, by 10 to about 25 percent.550 China’s contribution was 
notable. It scaled lithium mining output with an increase in production between 2022 and 2023 of 
almost 50 percent. 

Moreover, the knock-on dynamics are far from certain. At the same time that supply scaled up over 
the past year, EV adoption was slower than expected, reining in demand growth.551 This change in the 
supply and demand landscape in 2023 in turn led to drops in prices of some of these critical minerals, 
which in turn prompted the postponement of some previously announced projects.552

Therefore, uncertainty about the evolution of supply and demand remains, and potential imbalances 
between supply and demand need to be anticipated and managed to ensure that the transition 
continues apace.553

There is no shortage of raw materials, but questions surround how quickly they can be accessed 
The physical challenge of expanding the supply of critical minerals is not that there are insufficient 
critical minerals in the ground, but rather that it takes time for new extraction projects to come online. 
In fact, resources and reserves of metals and materials such as copper, lithium, and nickel have been 
increasing as more exploration has been undertaken and, indeed, are at an all-time high.554 However, 
lead times to access these reserves can be very long and uncertain. The IEA has estimated that, on 
average, it has taken 17 years for critical minerals projects to go from discovery to production over 
the past decade.555 Copper and nickel projects tend to have the longest lead times at 13 to 19 years. 
Lithium projects become operational quicker, at about five years. 

A number of factors explain these large variations in lead times. Physical factors such as the 
complexity of accessing the ore can play a large role. Other physical factors can also have a bearing 
on, for instance, the need to scale up (or even build from scratch) the infrastructure, such as access to 
power, water, and roads, rail, and ports, needed to support higher supply. This is not easy when mines 
are in remote locations. 

Nonphysical factors, such as the time it takes to get permits and financing, as well as whether 
enough people with the right skills are available, also determine lead times.556 Scarcity of available 
workers such as engineers has been particularly pronounced in many OECD countries. In Australia, 
for instance, job vacancies in mining have more than doubled since 2020.557 And fewer people are 
studying mining. The number of mining engineers graduating has fallen by 60 percent in Australia 
since 2014 and by 40 percent in the United States since 2016. 

Bottlenecks may be present beyond the extraction stage, during the refining of some minerals. 
Cobalt and lithium are relatively simple to refine, and therefore expanding refining capacity is less 
likely to be an issue; it can be done in as little as two years in economies where know-how and 
infrastructure are already strong.558 But other minerals, including rare earth elements and battery-
grade graphite, are more complex to refine, and refining capacity may be trickier to add.559

Another pertinent issue is that the extraction and, even more so, the refining of critical minerals 
are highly concentrated in a few countries around the globe. Therefore, sufficient access to refined 
minerals relies on the stability of global trade flows.560

Diversification would require new regions to ramp up their capacity quickly. For regions that would 
have to build refining capacity from scratch, for example, and would lack experience and expertise, 
this would be hard. In some cases, it could take decades (see Sidebar 12, “Critical minerals extraction 
and refining are highly concentrated, and diversification would take time and effort”).561

A combination of additional supply and demand levers would be required to alleviate imbalances
Imbalances between projected supply and expected demand for critical minerals would need to be 
addressed at both ends.

Accelerating supply 
There are a number of options for increasing the pace at which supply of critical minerals comes 
online. One option would be to accelerate lead times of new projects through, for instance, 
streamlining permitting and planning processes.562 Innovation in how projects are developed is 
another way to cut lead times. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, new copper and cobalt assets 
are being developed faster than ever through a mix of leveraging exploratory work undertaken 
from the 1960s to 1980s, and using modular construction to accelerate the design, planning, and 
construction phase.563

New technologies could also accelerate the time it takes to develop new projects. For example, direct 
lithium extraction could help ramp up supply more quickly. This process extracts lithium directly 
from brine without the need for extensive evaporation ponds. Some projects aim for recovery rates 
of about 90 percent, compared with 40 to 50 percent for the conventional process, and in only one 
week compared with 18 months when conventional evaporation ponds are used.564

Exploration, too, could be accelerated through the use of new technologies. For example, AI is being 
used to make exploration techniques more effective by improving estimates of prospective deposits 
and site selection.565 Other new technologies being explored, in the case of copper, for example, 
include bulk-ore sorting, coarse particle recovery, and digital twins of processing flow.566

Improving the efficiency of existing assets could also support supply increases.567 One way to 
increase efficiency is by ensuring that adequate and high-quality talent is available, for example 
through effective talent management and worker training.568

Recycled supply could also be used to supplement primary supply. End-of-life recycling rates for 
many critical minerals are relatively low.569 The EU’s Critical Raw Minerals Act has set a target of at 
least 25 percent of EU annual consumption of each strategic raw material to be met through recycling 
by 2030.570 Such measures to increase recycling can scale up the volume of supply, but their impact 
will not be immediate. This is because, in the short term at least, only a limited volume of materials is 
available to be recycled because comparatively few low-emissions assets have reached the end of 
their life.571

Reducing demand
Unlocking supply would need to be complemented with action on the demand side. In many cases, 
it may be possible to reduce the amount of critical minerals needed. Material intensity has fallen in 
many use cases. For example, the amount of lithium per unit used in EVs dropped by 30 percent, 
and the amount of polysilicon and silver used in solar panels by 60 to 80 percent, between 2010 
and 2022.572

Substitutions for some critical minerals could be possible if technological innovation allows. However, 
even if innovation pans out, there could be trade-offs; some substitutions could result in lower 
technological performance. In the case of hydrogen electrolyzers, for instance, a shift from proton 
exchange membrane to other technologies such as alkaline water electrolysis or, later on, solid oxide 
electrolyzer cells could reduce use of iridium.573 While it is less expensive than proton exchange 
membrane, alkaline water electrolysis is not capable of producing high-purity hydrogen gas required 
for fuel-cell vehicles.574

Sidebar 12. Critical minerals  
extraction and refining are 
highly concentrated, and  
diversification would take time 
and effort

Mining and refining of critical minerals today 
tend to be largely concentrated in a few 
economies. This can deliver high efficiency 
based on specialization and know-how but also 
poses risks of supply-chain disruptions that, 
if significant, could even have the potential to 
delay the energy transition. This reality has 
come increasingly into focus given recent trade 
tensions and supply disruptions. In several 
instances, these tensions and disruptions 
have affected global flows of critical minerals.1

Many of the critical minerals required for the 
energy transition, including cobalt, lithium, 
natural graphite, nickel, and rare earth 
elements, rely on the three largest supplying 
economies for more than 50 percent of their 
extraction, and more than 80 percent in the 
most extreme cases. For instance, Australia, 
Chile, and China together account for about 
90 percent of the global supply of lithium. 
The Democratic Republic of Congo accounts 
for more than 75 percent of cobalt extraction, 
and China for more than 60 percent and 
80 percent, respectively, of global extraction 
of rare earth elements and natural graphite.2

Refining of minerals tends to be even more 
geographically concentrated, with China 

being far and away the world leader.3 China 
accounts for more than 60 percent of the 
refining of cobalt, lithium, natural graphite, 
and rare earth elements.

Some diversification is under way in both 
extraction and refining. By 2030, 35 percent 
of global lithium production is expected to 
be sourced in regions that were not mining 
it in 2020.4 However, diversification may 
come up against constraints. One hurdle is 
environmental concerns. Chile, Serbia, and the 
United States have all experienced pushback 
against new mining projects from local 
communities in recent years.5 Such concerns 
relate, for instance, to energy and water 
requirements in the production and processing 
of critical minerals. Another issue is that critical 
minerals often lead to more waste rock than 
other more commonly extracted ores such as 
iron, and some of the waste rock and tailings 
generated in the extraction and processing 
can contain dangerous substances and 
damage the environment.6 The metal content in 
iron ore is typically 50 to 70 percent, compared 
to an average of less than 1 percent for copper.7 
By 2050, up to 13 billion tonnes of waste rock 
with limited applications could be created to 
produce 300 million tonnes of materials for 
clean energy technologies.8

In addition, some mineral resources occur in 
places where mining is particularly difficult, 
for example because they are only accessible 
at some times of the year due to weather 
conditions, or because there are concerns 
whether there is sufficient water.9

There are ways to mitigate some of the 
environmental impact of mineral extraction. 
One potential approach is to increase the 
efficiency of the extraction process through 
technological innovation. For example, 
reprocessing copper tailings with new 
solvents and reagents to extract more copper 
ore would reduce the amount of material 
moved from new mining operations and use 
less water.10 Direct lithium extraction could 
unlock new supplies while using less water.11

Another significant constraint is a shortage  
of skills, especially in refining. Many 
processing and refining stages of some 
critical minerals rely on know-how that 
is present in only a few economies and 
companies for specific steps, which makes 
it hard to replicate in other geographies or 
firms. It would take years or even decades to 
fully establish new capabilities.12

Potential solutions rely on international 
collaboration to develop and expand 
capabilities in new locations. In 2023, 
the Malaysian government renewed its 
partnership with the Australian mining 
company Lynas, creating the biggest refinery 
of rare earth elements outside China.13 In 
2023, 14 countries and the EU announced 
the Minerals Security Partnership with 
the aim of developing a more diversified 
mineral supply, including both extraction and 
processing, and announced new projects 
to diversify processing of minerals such as 
nickel and natural graphite.14

Another example is the fact that some automakers plan to shift toward electric motors that are free of 
rare earth elements.575 However, EVs that do not use rare earths could have lower performance, such 
as lower torque (capacity to do work) and power (ability to do work quickly).576 Finally, copper wiring 
can be replaced in many instances with aluminum, whose ore (bauxite) is more abundant. However, 
the properties of aluminum can be less suitable for some use cases; for example, it can be more 
prone to heat expansion than copper.577

These performance differences mean that alternative technologies may be suitable for some, but not 
all, use cases. For example, increasing the use of lithium iron phosphate batteries, which are already 
deployed in about 40 percent of new EVs, could help ease pressure on the supply of cobalt and 
nickel.578 These batteries also have lower energy density than the NMC (lithium nickel manganese 
cobalt) models that are currently most common, but they are still suitable for many mobility use cases 
when lower ranges are not an issue, an example being relatively small urban cars. 

To take another example, sodium-ion batteries are developing. These batteries could become an 
alternative to lithium-ion batteries, thereby reducing lithium demand. Their lower energy density 
means they can be particularly suited for use cases where density is less important, such as 
stationary grid-level storage.579 In 2023 and 2024, the first stationary projects using sodium-ion 
batteries were announced, and some EV makers are also planning on launching them for shorter-
range vehicles.580

Overall, while deployments of new technologies that require smaller quantities of critical minerals are 
starting to emerge, many of them would need to see much larger scaling. For instance, rare-earth-
free motors could scale from less than 10 percent of total supply to making up the majority of new 
supply by 2030.581

§ § §

The energy transition would require growing volumes of critical minerals, especially in the period 
to 2030. However, even with a surge in new projects that is currently anticipated, expected supply 
would not keep pace with demand in typical decarbonization scenarios. More effort would be needed 
to scale supply and manage demand, and therefore this is a Level 2 challenge. To scale extraction and 
refining capacity, constraints related to lead times, know-how, and other factors would need to be 
addressed. On the demand side, reducing material intensity and deploying new technologies that use 
alternative materials could be required. Recycling of end-of-life low-emissions technologies such as 
batteries could also play a large role. While some of these technologies are mature and already being 
deployed, others would require further innovation to narrow performance gaps, and many would 
require further scaling.

The use of LFP batteries, already 
deployed in 40 percent of new 
EVs, could help ease pressure on 
the supply of cobalt and nickel.

Note: This research examines 25 significant physical challenges in seven domains at the core of the energy transition, categorized in three levels. 
Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require the deployment of known 
technologies to accelerate, and associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological performance 
(often with demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning. The focus is on physical realities because they 
influence the ability to design an interdependent system that has performance comparable to that of the current system and to reduce emissions feasibly. These 
factors influence cost and affordability. Nonphysical factors—notably cost—are important but are not the focus of this research. Assessment of required 
deployment of technologies primarily draws on McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, which assumes that countries that have committed to net zero 
(some by 2050, some later) meet those commitments, and in which warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. This scenario is used because it 
provides sufficient regional and sectoral granularity for assessing required deployment. In some instances, this research also uses scenarios from other sources 
for reasons of data availability.

Today’s energy system relies on fossil fuels to serve as energy carriers (fuels that enable storing and 
transporting energy that can be used when and where needed) and as feedstocks for many industrial 
processes. The energy transition would require new low-emissions alternatives that could serve 
these functions, since not all use cases would be feasible, or desirable, to electrify.

Hydrogen is being discussed as an important option, especially given its versatility. It has been 
described as the “Swiss Army knife of decarbonization.”582

Carbon and

Today, hydrogen is predominantly used for refining fossil fuels (for example, to reduce the sulfur 
content of oil) and producing fertilizer (ammonia). About 90 million tonnes of hydrogen are consumed 
every year, and about 99 percent of current production results in high emissions, because it uses 
fossil fuels as an input and does not use carbon capture to abate resulting emissions.583

In a low-emissions energy system, hydrogen use could shift in two key ways. First, its production 
for current uses would have to be decarbonized. The share of low-emissions production would 
increase from about 1 percent today to more than 95 percent in 2050 under McKinsey’s 2023 
Achieved Commitments scenario.584 In this scenario, about two-thirds of this production would be 
of electrolytic hydrogen (that is, produced from the electrolysis of water using electricity), with the 
remainder mostly from fossil fuels combined with carbon capture (see Sidebar 13, “Hydrogen: From 
production to use”).585

Second, hydrogen could potentially play a much broader role than today in a low-emissions energy 
system, serving new use cases, but this would require scaling hydrogen production and doing so in 
a low-emissions way. Potential applications range from replacing fossil fuels as industrial feedstock 
in new use cases like steelmaking and plastics, to serving as an energy carrier by converting, 
transporting, and storing energy that can then fuel power generation, vehicles, and the production of 
high-temperature heat.

These roles could be enabled by hydrogen’s unique physical properties. First, hydrogen can be 
produced in low-emissions processes such as electrolysis, and it can also be used to provide low-
emissions energy. For example, using hydrogen in fuel cells produces electricity and releases water 
rather than CO2. Second, hydrogen has a high gravimetric energy density (by unit of mass) that is 
about three times larger than oil’s.586 Third, burning hydrogen can produce high-temperature heat of 
more than 2,000ºC.587 Fourth, it can be a low-emissions input to produce low-emissions steel as well 
as many chemicals and synthetic fuels (when combined with carbon). 

At the same time, other physical properties of hydrogen can be tricky to manage. First, hydrogen is 
hard to store, transport, and use. Its volumetric energy density is about one-half to two-thirds lower 
than that of natural gas.588 This means hydrogen needs to be transformed before being stored or 
transported, for example by being compressed or converted into other molecules in order to reduce 
the space it takes up.589 Furthermore, hydrogen is leaky. It is a very small molecule, and leakage can 
occur during transportation, especially when it is transported in gaseous form. Hydrogen can also 
permeate pipelines and storage tanks, affecting their structural integrity. Safety considerations are 
relevant, too. Hydrogen is highly flammable and can ignite more easily than gasoline and natural gas. 
Its flame is almost invisible, requiring special detection systems.590

Second, the processes involved in hydrogen’s production, conversion, and use entail substantial 
energy losses, for example, in the form of waste heat.  

Two physical challenges emerge from these physical properties, and both are Level 3. The first 
is harnessing hydrogen’s potential in new use cases by making the most of its advantageous 
properties, while also managing energy losses. The second is scaling the specialized infrastructure 
associated with the production, transportation, and use of hydrogen that would be needed to manage 
hydrogen’s tricky physical properties. Both would be hard to address and this leaves considerable 
uncertainty about how large a role hydrogen could play in a future energy system, and how much of 
it would be required by 2050.591 Total hydrogen production may have to scale by as much as four to 
five times from today according to McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, the IEA’s 2023 
Net Zero scenario, and Bloomberg NEF’s New Energy Outlook’s 2024 Net Zero scenario. In these 
scenarios, between 380 and 450 million tonnes of hydrogen would need to be produced by 2050.592 
Considerable scaling of production capacity of low-emissions hydrogen would be required, including 
scaling of associated capacity of electrolyzers (equipment used to produce hydrogen), from about 
one gigawatt today to about 4,000 gigawatts in 2050 in McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments 
scenario. And in this scenario, about 20 percent of total electricity consumption in 2050 could be 
used to power them.593

Sidebar 13. Hydrogen: From 
production to use

Hydrogen is produced, often transported  
and stored, and then finally used. For each 
phase of the hydrogen life cycle, different 
options exist. 

Production. There are several ways to 
produce hydrogen, each of which has a 
different emissions footprint. These different 
options are often referred to as hydrogen of 
different colors: 

 — Using unabated fossil fuels. Hydrogen 
is produced by separating hydrocarbon 
molecules into their constituent parts. 
Hydrogen produced this way is often 
referred to as gray, black, or brown.1 The 
process most frequently employed today 
is steam methane reforming, which uses 
natural gas to produce a mixture of CO2 
and hydrogen.2 More than 99 percent 
of current hydrogen production uses 
unabated fossil fuels as feedstocks. This 
is currently the lower-cost option, but has 
relatively high carbon emissions at eight 
to more than 20 tonnes of CO2 equivalent 
per tonne of hydrogen produced.3

 — Using fossil fuels with carbon capture. 

Hydrogen is produced through the same 
processes as before, but some of the 
resulting emissions are captured through 
carbon-capture technologies. Hydrogen 
produced this way is often referred to as 
blue. Hydrogen production with carbon 
capture is currently infrequent—less 

than 1 percent of hydrogen production 
currently uses carbon capture.4 It is also 
more costly than producing hydrogen 
through unabated fossil fuels, because 
of the addition of a carbon capture step. 
However, it could result in as much as 90 
to 95 percent lower emissions per tonne 
of hydrogen produced.5

 — Electrolysis. Hydrogen can be produced 
with no direct emissions by electrolyzing 
water (splitting hydrogen from oxygen in 
water molecules) through technologies 
such as alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), 
proton exchange membrane (PEM), 
and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) 
among others. Very little hydrogen—less 
than 0.5 percent of global production 
in 2022—is currently produced through 
electrolysis.6 Nonetheless, electrolyzer 
technologies are mature and proven; 
AWE and PEM electrolyzers are currently 
the most commonly used.7 Today, 
hydrogen production with electrolysis 
using renewable electricity costs more 
than hydrogen production with carbon 
capture.8 Hydrogen produced using 
electrolysis is often referred to as green, 
pink, or yellow.9

 — Other options. Pyrolysis of natural gas 
produces hydrogen and solid carbon 
rather than CO2 emissions. Hydrogen 
produced through this route is often 
called turquoise hydrogen. Only small 
demonstration projects have been 
undertaken to date.10 Naturally occurring 
hydrogen—often referred to as white 

hydrogen—could potentially be extracted 
in a similar way to natural gas. This 
source of hydrogen is at an early stage of 
exploration.

Transportation and storage. There are 
several options for transporting and storing 
hydrogen: 

 — Short-distance transportation. For 

transportation over shorter distances, 
hydrogen is usually compressed. 
Hydrogen can then be carried by trucks, 
usually for up to 500 kilometers, or by 
pipelines over a few thousand kilometers.

 — Long-distance transportation. For 

transporting hydrogen across longer 
distances, other means are needed 
beyond pipelines and for this to occur 
would require hydrogen’s volume to 
be reduced by more than compression 
can achieve. One option for reducing 
its volume would be to liquefy hydrogen 
by cooling it to minus 253ºC. Hydrogen 
can also be converted into intermediary 
chemicals (hydrogen carriers) such as 
ammonia and liquid organic hydrogen 
carriers.11 These carriers are more 
energy-dense and enable larger amounts 
of energy to be stored by unit of volume. 
The liquefied hydrogen or its carriers can 
then be transported, usually by ship. One 
main alternative to the transportation of 
hydrogen itself is the transportation of 
products that are made using hydrogen, 
such as direct reduced iron and synthetic 
fuels.

 Gray refers to hydrogen produced from natural gas. Black and brown refer to hydrogen produced from different varieties of coal. For all color references in this section see “What is 
hydrogen energy?” McKinsey, September 27, 2023; and Hydrogen colours codes, H2 Bulletin, accessed June 2024. 
 In this process, natural gas (methane) reacts with steam in the presence of a catalyst to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO). The CO produced is then converted into CO2 
in a water-gas shift reaction. Another common way of producing hydrogen today using fossil fuels is coal gasification.
 The upper end of this range corresponds to coal gasification, while the lower end corresponds to steam methane reforming, without carbon capture but with best available 
technologies. See Comparison of the emissions intensity of different hydrogen production routes, IEA, 2021, updated June 2023.

Sidebar 13. Hydrogen: From 
production to use (continued)

 — Storage. A number of different storage 
options exist depending on duration 
and type of discharge (that is, access 
to the stored hydrogen) needed. For 
smaller-scale applications, compressed 
and liquefied hydrogen can be stored 
in tanks, which enable fast discharge of 
the stored hydrogen when it is required. 
For long-term and large-scale storage, 
a number of options are possible, 
including salt caverns, depleted oil and 
gas reservoirs, and water aquifers. 
Salt caverns are suitable for frequent 
use, and this approach is mature, with 
a proven track record of hydrogen 
storage over five decades.12 But they 
are not available at all locations. Porous 
reservoirs, such as aquifers and depleted 
oil and gas fields, could be used to store 
hydrogen. However, their exploration 
has progressed more slowly and this 
approach has only been used for mixes 
of methane and hydrogen, and is not yet 
proven for pure hydrogen storage.13

Use. Hydrogen has several potential use 
cases. While it is being explored for many 
applications, its ultimate attractiveness in 
comparison with alternative technologies 
is still often debated (see the discussion 
later in this chapter as part of Challenge 20). 
Potential uses include ways in which 

hydrogen is already deployed in industrial 
settings as well as new use cases in the 
power, mobility, and industry domains. 

 — Industry feedstock. Hydrogen can be 
used as an input for many industrial 
processes. Some of them, including 
using hydrogen in the production of 
ammonia and oil refining, are already 
widely deployed. More nascent use 
cases—with first projects ramping up in 
the mid-2020s—include using hydrogen 
as a reducing agent for stripping oxygen 
from iron ore in the steel industry and the 
use of hydrogen and captured carbon to 
create feedstock for plastics production, 
such as e-methanol (see chapter 7 on the 
industry domain).14

 — Power storage and generation. 

Hydrogen can be used to store energy. 
Low-emissions power can be used to 
create hydrogen (known as power-to-
gas). When and where the energy is 
needed, the hydrogen (or a hydrogen 
derivative) that is produced can then be 
used in turbines or fuel cells to generate 
electricity. Today, there are already gas 
turbines that can be fitted to run on 
pure hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen 
and other gases such as natural gas or 
syngas—a synthetic gas produced from 
hydrogen and a mixture of other gases, 
including carbon monoxide.15 However, 
currently essentially no hydrogen is 
used to generate power at scale—
although many utilities companies have 

demonstrated co-firing of hydrogen and 
natural gas in initial trials in recent years.16

 — Mobility. Hydrogen can be used as a 
fuel for road vehicles powered by fuel 
cells where electrification with batteries 
may be challenging due to the need for 
extended ranges and heavy loads, such 
as long-haul trucks. A small number—
about 80,000—of FCEVs (including 
passenger cars, buses, and trucks) are 
currently on the road (see chapter 6 on 
the mobility domain).17 Hydrogen is also 
being considered for use in the aviation 
and maritime sectors, mostly in the form 
of hydrogen-derivate fuels, such as 
ammonia and methanol in maritime, and 
sustainable aviation fuel in aviation. While 
planes and ships that are technically able 
to run on some of these fuels are already 
available today, barely any of such fuels 
have yet been used. Fossil fuels still 
provide more than 99 percent of energy 
used in shipping and aviation.18

 — High-temperature heat. Hydrogen 
burns at temperatures of more than 
2,000ºC and could be used to provide 
high-temperature heat for industrial 
processes. Multiple pilots are exploring 
this use—although, in most cases, the 
hydrogen has been deployed in a mixture 
with natural gas rather being used by 
itself.19 In some markets, hydrogen has 
also been discussed as a potential option 
for residential heating, either in isolation 
or blended with natural gas.20

Carbon and

This massive scale-up of hydrogen production and infrastructure is still in its early stages. While 
announcements of new low-emissions hydrogen projects have accelerated across the globe, thus far, 
only a small fraction of all of the announced capacity to date—about 5 percent—has reached a final 
investment decision. This leaves a lot of uncertainty about the potential for scaling up the projects.594

Of course, hydrogen is not the only low-emissions energy carrier that could play a useful role in 
the energy transition. Energy carriers could be derived from biomass, and could also be pivotal 
in use cases ranging from industry, such as providing high-temperature heat in the manufacture 
of cement, to aviation, where they could be an input for sustainable fuel. Challenge 22, a Level 2 
challenge related to managing the footprint of biofuels, is summarized in chapter 2 of this report but 
not explored further here.595 Under the IEA’s Net Zero scenario, use of modern forms of bioenergy 
(excluding traditional biomass use) would grow by about 8 percent a year between 2022 and 2030, 
more than double the rate at which it is currently increasing.596 Continuing to scale production of 
biofuels would require managing competition for the land they would need. Developing new, more 
efficient biofuels could help, as would increasing the use of biomass sources such as waste, which 
does not increase competition for land. 

Challenge 20: Harnessing hydrogen (Level 3)
Hydrogen has significant potential to be an enabler in many domains of the energy transition, 
including power, mobility, and industry—well beyond today’s use cases. However, harnessing 
hydrogen’s potential in new use cases to complement other low-emissions solutions would require 
balancing a range of advantageous properties with the substantial physical challenges associated 
with its production, transportation and storage, and use.

Hydrogen is being considered for new use cases, some of which have other  
low-emissions alternatives
In a scenario where countries meet their stated climate commitments, the majority of potential 
hydrogen use by 2050 could come from new use cases that have so far not been deployed at scale. 
Of total potential hydrogen demand in 2050 in McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, 
only about one-quarter could come from use cases where hydrogen is already deployed. These use 
cases are mostly in industry and relate to the refining of fossil fuels and the production of ammonia 
(fertilizer) and other chemicals.597 The remaining demand would come from new use cases where 
uptake of hydrogen has not yet ramped up.

However, in these new use cases, there are often low-emissions alternatives to hydrogen. In some 
applications, the beneficial properties of hydrogen could eventually enable it to play a leading role 
in, for instance, steelmaking, as well as in shipping and long-haul aviation, where hydrogen could 
be used to make synthetic fuel.598 Such use cases could represent about 35 percent of potential 
demand for hydrogen under McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario. In other use cases, 
which account for the remaining 40 percent of potential hydrogen demand by 2050, strong low-
emissions alternatives exist, for example in the form of direct electrification. The extent to which 
hydrogen or other approaches could be used is still uncertain. For example, in power storage a 
range of technologies, including Li-ion batteries, pumped-hydro storage, novel LDES, and biogas 
could be used to provide needed storage of different durations. In road mobility, BEVs and vehicles 
that run on other low-emissions fuels, such as biofuels, can serve different use cases. In industrial 
heat production, electric heating and low-emissions fuels, such as biomass, are being developed to 
produce high-temperature heat. 

Given that there are alternatives to hydrogen in many use cases, which could either complement 
hydrogen or be used instead of it, it is important to compare the relative performance of hydrogen 
and these other options.

Using hydrogen involves energy losses, but offers other advantages
At every stage of hydrogen’s journey, from production to transportation, storage, and use, energy is 
lost. The physical processes that take place during this journey consume energy, and after each step,

less energy is available for use (for example, due to losses in the chemical reactions that occur in the 
step or the production of waste heat). 

It is important to take a close look at hydrogen’s energy losses because they can influence whether 
using hydrogen is cost-effective and therefore whether hydrogen is adopted. A large share—as 
high as 70 percent in some cases—of the total cost of producing hydrogen relates to the energy 
inputted.599 More energy is needed when hydrogen is compressed, converted, and transported, and 
this adds to cost. Furthermore, the sheer amount of energy that hydrogen may require matters for the 
design of a new energy system, because the higher the energy losses, the more additional electricity 
generation capacity would need to be built to power hydrogen production. By 2050, 20 percent of 
total electricity consumption could be used to produce hydrogen—more than total low-emissions 
electricity currently being generated.600

Because energy losses occur at each step, the end-to-end energy efficiency of hydrogen can be 
low. Energy efficiency is expressed as a ratio of the energy output at the end of each stage to the 
energy input at the beginning of that stage. In simple terms, it describes the amount of energy that 
is available for an intended end-use after a given step, divided by the amount of energy that went 
into that step. For example, during the production stage, efficiency compares the output (energy 
contained in the hydrogen produced) with the input provided (such as the electricity used to produce 
that hydrogen). In the use stage, energy efficiency compares the output (for example, the energy 
delivered from the motor of a car to its wheels) with the input provided (the energy contained in the 
hydrogen in the fuel tank). Values referenced below are based on the higher heating value (HHV) of 
hydrogen.601 In sequence, the efficiency of each step is as follows: 

 — Production. A large amount of energy is needed when hydrogen is produced in order to break 
chemical bonds and convert inputs, such as natural gas or water, into hydrogen. The energy 
efficiency of the most common production methods ranges from 75 to 80 percent. This means 
that about 20 to 25 percent of the energy that was used to produce hydrogen (for example, 
electricity) is lost, with the rest being contained in hydrogen (in HHV terms) and available for the 
next step of the process. The exact efficiency figure depends on the specific production method. 
When hydrogen is produced from unabated fossil fuels, as it is in steam-methane reforming, 
energy efficiency is about 80 percent.602 When a carbon capture step is used, efficiency drops 
to about 75 percent. And energy efficiency when hydrogen is produced through electrolysis 
currently ranges from about 75 to 80 percent when using AWE and PEM electrolyzers. Nascent 
solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolyzers, which can make use of waste heat, can deliver 
efficiency of more than 90 percent.603

 — Transportation and storage. In its raw gaseous form, hydrogen has very low volumetric density 
and therefore, to be transported and stored, it needs to be either compressed, liquefied, or 
converted into other molecules. These transformations can also entail significant energy losses 
incurred during the process. These losses could come from energy spent in compressors or in 
the reactions to convert hydrogen into another energy carrier. Overall, the energy efficiency of 
these conversions ranges from 65 to 95 percent. Efficiency is highest when hydrogen is carried 
over short distances and used without needing to be stored or transformed into other molecules. 
Efficiency is lowest when it is converted into a different energy carrier and then reconverted into 
hydrogen. Compressed hydrogen (that remains in gaseous form) transported through pipelines 
can lead to efficiencies of about 90 to 95 percent. In the case of liquid hydrogen transportation, 
energy efficiency drops to 65 to 75 percent, because a large amount of energy is spent in the 
liquefaction process.604 Additional losses can occur, their magnitude depending on how long 
the hydrogen is stored and transported. Liquid hydrogen may lose around 0.2 to 0.5 percent of 
its value every day through boil-off (essentially, evaporation) when being transported by ship, 
and close to 0.05 percent when kept in stationary storage.605 The efficiency of the conversion of 
hydrogen into ammonia is about 80 to 90 percent. However, if ammonia is then reconverted to 
hydrogen, the total efficiency drops to roughly 65 to 75 percent, given that losses occur in both

stages of the transformation. Finally, in the case of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), 
energy efficiency is about 65 percent, including the reconversion back to hydrogen.606

 — Use. Energy efficiency for the hydrogen use step ranges from 40 to 80 percent (or even 

90 percent if released heat is reused). This value corresponds to the energy that is actually 
converted into useful work (such as movement or power), compared with the energy contained in 
the hydrogen that is consumed. The remaining energy is lost, for example as waste heat. When 
hydrogen is used for heating, such as being burned in a boiler, it can reach 75 to 80 percent 
efficiency, which is similar to the efficiency of natural gas boilers.607 In road mobility use cases, the 
energy efficiency of fuel cells is typically 40 to 50 percent; the remaining energy is lost largely as 
waste heat.608 In power, it ranges between 40 and 50 percent in the case of peaking power plants 
when energy is generated, using fuel cells or turbines.609 Again, efficiencies are similar to those of 
existing natural gas turbines.610 Options that reuse released heat to, for instance, heat spaces or 
water can raise energy efficiency. For example, combined heat and power plants can have energy 
efficiencies of about 85 to 90 percent.611

Hydrogen can be less energy-efficient than electrification in specific use cases
Energy losses at each stage compound. For example, if efficiencies are 80 percent in production, 
90 percent in transportation, and 50 percent in use, end-to-end hydrogen efficiency would be 
around 35 percent.612

The result is that hydrogen use would generally lead to lower energy efficiency than direct 
electrification—when the latter is available. Consider a scenario in which electricity powers an 
electrolyzer to produce hydrogen that is then compressed and used locally, and compare this with a 
scenario in which the same electricity is instead used directly. 

If hydrogen is used in a FCEV, only about 25 to 35 percent of the energy originally available in the form 
of electricity is converted into actually running the vehicle. By comparison, a BEV may have 80 to 
90 percent energy efficiency, or up to quadruple that of a hydrogen-powered FCEV (Exhibit 39). 

When hydrogen is used to produce heat in industrial processes, it delivers end-to-end efficiencies 
of around 50 to 60 percent. In comparison, direct electrification can have energy efficiency of 90 to 
99 percent if resistance-based heating is used, and as much as 150 to 400 percent if heat pumps 
are used (although they can only reach relatively lower temperatures).613 All in all, electrification of 
industrial heat can have from close to twice to up to eight times the efficiency of hydrogen. And when 
hydrogen is used to store power, only about 25 to 40 percent of the energy drawn from the grid is 
converted back into power (round-trip efficiency) while the remaining 60 to 75 percent is lost. In 
comparison, using novel LDES can result in about 40 to 70 percent round-trip energy efficiency—
it can range from matching the efficiency of hydrogen to having three times the efficiency.614 
Li-ion batteries and pumped-hydro storage can have even higher round-trip efficiencies of 75 to 
90 percent.615

These results assume that hydrogen and electricity are produced and used locally. In a scenario 
where additional transportation losses were incurred (for example, if hydrogen were converted to 
ammonia and then back to hydrogen), overall energy efficiencies would be even lower. Of course, 
depending on how and when hydrogen is produced, the impacts on overall system efficiency can 
differ, which is discussed in the next section (see also Sidebar 14, “Limitations on and assumptions 
about energy-efficiency calculations”).

For purposes of comparison, this research 
looks at the relative efficiency of direct 
electrification and electrolytic hydrogen, 
since both start from the same form of energy 
(electricity). This enables an apples-to-apples 
comparison of the most efficient use for a 
given amount of electricity. The efficiencies of 
use cases involving other sources of energy, 
such as fossil-fuel-based ICEs and biomass-
based boilers, are not directly comparable 
and displayed only for reference. 

Because of the multiple steps and 
transformations of the hydrogen journey with 

energy losses at every stage, assumptions 
made about the precise way that hydrogen 
is produced are highly relevant to its energy 
efficiency. This analysis assumes that 
hydrogen is produced in the most common 
ways: from alkaline water electrolysis/
proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, 
and then compressed and used locally. To 
compare hydrogen-based use cases and 
direct electrification, energy efficiency was 
calculated starting from the point of use of 
electricity onward. In the case of hydrogen, 
this point is the electrolyzer; in the case of 
direct electrification, it is the point of intake 
of electricity, such as the charging of an 
electric vehicle. 

Importantly, this comparison assumes that 
hydrogen and electricity are used locally 
and at the time of production of electricity, 
and excludes losses related to the upstream 
production, storage, or distribution of that 
electricity. Such considerations could change 
relative efficiency in specific use cases.

A final caveat is that this analysis is a direct 
comparison of hydrogen and electrification 
to help dimensionalize the energy-efficiency 
implications of using hydrogen. It does not 
consider other potential upsides of producing 
and using hydrogen (or electricity) in different 
locations or at different times from where it 
was originally produced, which could affect 
overall system efficiency. We discuss this 
issue separately later in the chapter. 

While it can be less energy-efficient than electrification, hydrogen offers other advantages
Given these efficiency losses, why use hydrogen? Energy efficiency is an important performance 
parameter when comparing technologies, but it is only one of many factors determining which 
technology is appropriate for a given use. Consider, for instance, that fossil fuels also have large 
energy losses—passenger cars convert as little as 15 to at most 30 percent of the energy in diesel 
into propelling their movement.616 The fact that fossil fuels are relatively affordable and energy 
dense has enabled them to be the key fuels for most transportation over the past century despite 
energy losses. 

It is therefore also important to consider hydrogen’s other physical properties when comparing it 
with other low-emissions alternatives. Other physical properties of hydrogen could offer distinct 
advantages and complement electrification in specific use cases, including the following:

 — Producing high-temperature heat while limiting the retrofitting needed. Several industrial 

processes require very high-temperature heat and currently rely on burning fossil fuels, such 
as natural gas and coal. While different electrification technologies may be able to deliver the 
temperatures required, deploying them usually entails large retrofits of existing assets (see 
chapter 7 on the industry domain). Using hydrogen (or hydrogen combined with natural gas) in 
existing furnaces or boilers could be possible with more limited retrofitting. 

 — Storing power for very long durations. Hydrogen could provide flexibility in power systems 
by being used to store energy over weeks, months, or even seasons and making the power 
available when generation from renewables is low due to, say, a lack of wind or sun (see chapter 
5 on the power domain). Using hydrogen in this way could also enable more renewable power 
that would otherwise not be utilized to be stored and used at a later date. Compared with Li-ion 
batteries, using hydrogen for storage leads to comparatively lower fixed capital costs, but higher 
operational costs, because energy efficiency is lower.617 As such, hydrogen could be particularly 
well suited for use cases where power needs to be stored for very long durations and where 
bursts of large amounts of power are needed only intermittently or sporadically. Hydrogen 
could complement Li-ion batteries, which are efficient for use cases that require more frequent 
and short-discharge durations, such as in the case of intraday storage. Other forms of storage

over long periods are possible but have different limitations. There are limited suitable sites for 
pumped-hydro storage. Biogas used as a fuel in power generation could be limited by whether 
sufficient biomass is available (see chapter 5 on the power domain). And while novel long-duration 
energy storage systems, such as compressed air energy storage, are emerging that could play 
a role similar to that of hydrogen in long-term storage, most of those being tested today are less 
suitable for the very longest (seasonal shifting) storage purposes over the course of months. The 
longest-duration storage options currently being tested are designed for heat storage rather than 
power storage, although this could change with further innovation.618

 — Fueling vehicles that need to carry large payloads over long ranges. Hydrogen and fuels derived 
from hydrogen can be more than 100 times more energy dense by weight than current batteries 
(about one megajoule per kilogram in the case of Li-ion batteries, compared with about 140 
for hydrogen).619 The lower energy density of batteries means electric vehicles face trade-offs 
between range and payload, which affects their performance in use cases such as trucking, 
shipping, and aviation. Vehicles powered by hydrogen or hydrogen-derived fuels could carry 
larger payloads without sacrificing so much range. Furthermore, battery electric vehicles take 
longer to recharge than hydrogen-based vehicles and may face more challenges operating 
under extremely cold temperatures. In the case of trucking, hydrogen-powered trucks could be 
one option to meet some of the trickiest routes that demand the highest payloads and ranges.
In the case of aviation and shipping, electrification is expected to play a smaller role in the overall 
energy mix by 2050 than alternative fuels, such as ones based on hydrogen.620 Of course, using 
hydrogen in these cases comes with its own caveats. In volumetric terms (that is, by unit of 
volume), hydrogen’s energy density is comparatively less attractive, which means that liquefaction 
or compression would be needed. Furthermore, refueling infrastructure would need to be 
developed. Finally, there are alternative fuels beyond hydrogen that have high energy density, 
notably biofuels, and could also be considered. 

 — Substituting fossil-fuel feedstocks for industrial processes. Hydrogen could be used as a 

feedstock for many new industrial processes. In steelmaking, for instance, hydrogen can be a 
low-emissions feedstock as a reductant that replaces coke. While direct electrification (molten 
ore electrolysis) could also be possible, hydrogen-based approaches are further along the 
innovation track, with large projects already in place.621 In other industries, hydrogen combined 
with captured carbon could provide synthetic feedstocks. For example, it can be used to produce 
e-methanol, which could, in turn, be used as an alternative feedstock for plastics production. As 
in the case of fuels, alternative approaches to hydrogen could include bio-based feedstocks and 
could also be considered (see chapter 7 on the industry domain). 

For use cases where both hydrogen and other-low emissions alternatives are available, they could 
play a complementary role by being suited for slightly different use cases within a given application. 
For example, while battery electric trucks could cover the majority of freight routes, hydrogen-based 
trucks could be used for specific routes that require the very longest ranges and largest payloads 
(see chapter 6 on the mobility domain for further discussion). And while Li-ion and novel LDES could 
be used for the majority of intraday and intraweek needs, hydrogen could play a complementary role 
in the very longest seasonal duration storage use cases. 

To harness hydrogen’s advantages would require innovation, system reconfiguration,  
and matching it to the right use cases
To leverage hydrogen’s advantageous properties, a combination of approaches would be needed, 
including innovation, the reconfiguration of the energy system, and ensuring that those properties 
are deployed in the right use cases. 

 — Innovation could improve hydrogen energy efficiency to an extent. Technological advances 
already under way could lower energy losses during hydrogen’s life cycle. In production, 
SOECs have higher production efficiencies than current AWE/PEM models.622 SOECs operate 
at high temperatures (typically over 500°C) and convert water in steam into hydrogen and

oxygen, separating the two using an electrolyte.623 The heat needed to produce the steam 
could be supplied from alternative sources, such as waste heat from industry, and enhance 
overall efficiency. Two large SOEC demonstration projects began in 2023. Other electrolyzer 
technologies could offer 95 percent efficiency and are expected to be commercialized by 2025.624 
Innovation in end uses, such as combined heat and power plants, could deliver higher energy 
efficiency, too.

 — The energy system could be reconfigured to minimize the impact of energy losses. Two routes  

to achieving this are the following: 

•  Hydrogen production could be configured to happen where and when it is most beneficial 
for the efficiency of the overall system. It makes sense to produce hydrogen when and 
where it is most efficient to do so. Hydrogen can be used to store large amounts of energy 
over time. As electrolyzers can be run flexibly, hydrogen can absorb excess renewables 
production that would otherwise not be utilized—in short, hydrogen can be produced at times 
when VRE generation exceeds demand.625 Hydrogen can also be produced in areas where 
renewables deployment is most efficient. For example, on average, solar power in Spain has 
double the capacity factors as Germany.626 Of course, the relative merits of using hydrogen to 
store and move energy would need to be compared with other forms of storage and energy 
transportation, such as electric storage and transmission infrastructure. In the case of storage, 
hydrogen may be particularly suitable for very-long-duration storage in comparison with 
other options. Generally speaking, transporting hydrogen would be most efficient when the 
final demand is in the form of hydrogen, while transporting the electricity itself would be most 
efficient when the final demand is for power. The same logic would apply to hydrogen carriers. 
Consider ammonia. The efficiency of the system would be highest if ammonia is produced 
through hydrogen when and where renewables are more plentiful, and if the ammonia is 
then used in a location directly (say as an input for fertilizer production). Efficiency would be 
comparatively lower if the ammonia is reconverted back to hydrogen or electricity.  

•  Moving intermediate goods with embedded energy could lead to lower energy losses than 

transporting hydrogen itself. One of the ways to reduce transportation losses would be to use 
hydrogen locally to produce intermediate products such as HBI (hot briquetted iron from the 
DRI process), ethylene, or urea, which could then be transported over longer distances, instead 
of moving the hydrogen itself.627 This has the potential to minimize the compounded losses 
that accrue through production, transportation, storage, and use today. While promising, this 
approach would necessitate a transformation of our material production system. For example, 
using HBI as a form of transporting embedded energy would lead to a decoupling of ironmaking 
and steelmaking steps into different regions.628 

 — Hydrogen can be prioritized for use cases where it could offer the highest value and 

complement other approaches. It makes sense to employ hydrogen in use cases that can make 
the most of its advantageous properties and in a way that complements electrification and other 
low-emissions alternatives. Priority could be given to using low-emissions hydrogen where 
there is no feasible alternative for decarbonization and to use cases where hydrogen offers a 
clear benefit over low-emissions alternatives. Making sure hydrogen is used optimally would 
require careful consideration of its physical properties on a case-by-case basis. For instance, 
hydrogen’s chemical flexibility and high energy density could potentially be particularly useful 
in the production of low-emissions steel and in mobility use cases with the highest payload or 
range requirements, while hydrogen usage in cases with established high-performing electric-
based alternatives (such as low- and medium-temperature heating through heat pumps) would 
be less clear-cut.

§ § §

Harnessing hydrogen for new use cases is a Level 3 challenge. Some of hydrogen’s physical 
properties make it difficult to deploy, and can result in energy losses during its production, 
conversion, and use. As a result, using hydrogen is generally less energy efficient than direct 
electrification when the latter is available. Importantly, hydrogen does have beneficial physical 
properties. Careful assessment of where those properties could be most useful would help to clarify 
where hydrogen could most advantageously be deployed. Furthermore, losses would have to be 
managed, which would require both more innovation of individual technologies—such as new, more 
efficient electrolyzers—and configuring the energy system to ensure that hydrogen is produced when 
and where it enables the system to be more efficient overall. 

Challenge 21: Scaling hydrogen’s infrastructure (Level 3)
For hydrogen to play a larger role in a low-emissions energy system, a significant scale-up of low-
emissions production, transportation, and storage infrastructure would be needed. This, in turn, 
would require developing supporting supply chains and inputs as well as resolving associated 
interdependencies.

Hydrogen production would require scaling of capacity, and large-scale power and inputs
More than 1,000 low-emissions hydrogen production projects have been announced globally. 
Europe has the largest share of announced projects, followed by North America. Despite these 
developments, actual deployment has been slow. For example, only about 5 percent of planned low-
emissions hydrogen production capacity globally has been committed and passed final investment 
decisions.629 Today, about one gigawatt of installed electrolysis capacity has been built globally. 
That would rise by many thousand-fold to about 4,000 gigawatts by 2050 under McKinsey’s 2023 
Achieved Commitments scenario. 

Two key inputs could make expanding hydrogen production capacity harder. First, electrolytic 
hydrogen production would need a great deal of power. Hydrogen production currently accounts 
for a very small share of total electricity use. However, by 2030, 3 to 5 percent of total electricity 
generated could be dedicated to producing low-emissions hydrogen, a figure that climbs to about 
20 percent by 2050 under McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitment scenario.630 Second, one of the 
most common electrolyzer models today—PEM, which accounts for about 30 percent of current 
electrolyzer installed capacity—relies on critical inputs that could be in short supply, such as iridium 
and other platinum group metals.631

Scaling the capacity for hydrogen production while using fossil fuels in combination with carbon 
capture would also pose challenges, notably scaling CCUS technologies and transportation, storage, 
and use options for the carbon captured (see chapter 11 on carbon and energy reduction).

Scaling hydrogen production could be aided by an acceleration in the development of projects  
and innovation of electrolyzers 
To scale hydrogen production capacity, acceleration would be needed in both closing financial 
commitments and scaling up supply chains and manufacturing. In some regions, this is starting to 
happen. China is outpacing others on the volume deployed after final investment decisions, and it 
accounts for about 50 percent of electrolyzer capacity globally.632

To provide the necessary expansion of low-emissions power to enable a ramp-up in hydrogen 
production would necessitate the building of additional dedicated renewable capacity. This is 
happening in some cases, an example being the construction of an electrolysis plant in Saudi Arabia 
with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, which is to be powered by four gigawatts of renewable 
power from onshore solar, wind, and storage. When commissioned in 2026, the plant could produce 
up to 600 tons of low-emissions hydrogen a day.633 Such investments are promising, but many more 
would be needed to achieve the magnitude of the scale-up required.

Innovation could also be instrumental in addressing some of the key input constraints on scale-
ups. Different electrolyzer models could alleviate the pressure on critical mineral supplies. The first 
deployment of iridium-free PEM electrolyzers was announced in 2023.634 Other technologies, such 
as SOEC electrolyzers, could also help manage critical mineral and power needs because they can be 
more energy-efficient than currently used electrolyzer models.635

Transportation and storage infrastructure would also need to be scaled up, requiring  
innovation, new projects, and retrofits 
Hydrogen’s low volumetric density, potential for leakage, and safety considerations can make it 
hard to transport. Specialized infrastructure would therefore be needed on a large scale, alongside 
innovation in cases where technology is less mature, to make its transportation viable. 

In the case of short-distance transportation, the cumulative length of hydrogen pipelines could have 
to scale by about 40 times by 2050, from about 5,000 kilometers today to more than 200,000 by 
2050, under the IEA’s Net Zero scenario.636 One way to achieve a scale-up of this magnitude would 
be through retrofitting to repurpose the extensive network of natural gas pipelines that spans more 
than one million kilometers today.637 For example, in July 2023, Germany’s gas system operators 
presented a draft of a hydrogen-transportation network that would include about 9,700 kilometers of 
repurposed gas pipelines.638 One concern about developing hydrogen-fit pipelines is embrittlement 
in the steel and welds caused by the absorption of hydrogen atoms or molecules by the pipe material. 
As a result, some pipelines, especially older or damaged ones, would need to undergo more extensive 
retrofitting, such as using pipe coatings or alternative materials like fiber-reinforced plastics.639

Transporting hydrogen over long distances would be even harder because it would require 
approaches other than pipelines, alongside converting hydrogen into other states or other 
derivatives. Many approaches for long-distance transportation are already mature. For example, 
transportation of hydrogen carriers such as ammonia and methanol already occurs on a large 
scale.640 However, some potential approaches still require further innovation. Ammonia crackers used 
to reconvert ammonia back to hydrogen are not yet available commercially. In the case of LOHC, while 
first pilot shipments occurred in 2020 and 2022, experimentation is still under way with different 
organic carriers to improve the efficiency of the conversion process.641

Where needed, shipping would be the most likely option for long-distance transportation of 
hydrogen, derivatives, or byproducts. Shipping would need about a tenfold scale-up by 2050 under 
McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario; today, fewer than 100 ships are able to transport 
these products. Their number could potentially increase to about 1,000 by 2050, split roughly 
equally into liquefied hydrogen ships, green iron carriers, and hydrogen-derivative carriers.642 In 
addition to increasing the number of suitable ships, significant loading and unloading facilities as well 
as ammonia crackers to transform ammonia back into hydrogen would be required in ports. Here, 
too, using existing infrastructure could help, although this would necessitate extensive retrofitting. 
For instance, the European Union has approved financing for the conversion of the Hamburg LNG 
terminal in Germany so that it can support hydrogen carriers such as ammonia.643

Additional scale-up in storage options for hydrogen would also be required, from about 0.5 terawatt-
hour today to more than 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2050 under the IEA’s Net Zero scenario.644 Salt 
caverns are a mature option for storage that has been used since the 1970s, but there are limited 
numbers of them, and more forms of storage would be needed by 2050. Innovation could help. Trials 
are under way to test different storage options, including porous reservoirs, such as depleted oil 
and gas reservoirs, and water aquifers. However, these have not yet been demonstrated for pure 
hydrogen storage. Multiple projects in Europe and the United States have been launched to test 
the viability of different sites. Announced storage projects offer capacity of 30 terawatt-hours, split 
almost equally between salt caverns and depleted gas fields.645 Other new forms of storage, such as 
absorption and adsorption, are also promising because they have high densities of volumetric storage 
and higher efficiency than existing options. However, they are still nascent.646

Finally, the assets that use hydrogen would also need to scale significantly. Retrofitting could be 
an important part of this. Existing assets running on natural gas, including gas turbines for power 
generation and gas boilers for heat, could be retrofitted to take either pure hydrogen or a blend 
of hydrogen and natural gas. Current gas turbines are subject to regulatory limits on allowable 
hydrogen content (typically 1 to 5 percent of volume). However, manufacturers are working on 
designing combustors retrofitted from existing gas turbines that could run on mixed fuels made 
up of 100 percent hydrogen. EU turbine manufacturers have committed to delivering standard gas 
turbines that can handle pure hydrogen by 2030.647 Likewise, while the use of hydrogen in industrial 
heating contexts has proven feasible using existing burners, it would require some retrofitting to 
accommodate the properties of hydrogen gas.648

§ § §

Scaling up hydrogen’s infrastructure is a Level 3 challenge. The scale-up of hydrogen production 
capacity and support infrastructure is nascent. Scaling hydrogen is hard given the amount of 
specialized infrastructure and inputs required. Production capacity would need to scale up 
thousands of times, and many of the required technologies (such as some forms of long-distance 
transportation of hydrogen derivatives and reconversion to hydrogen) have not been developed at 
scale. More innovation could help manage tricky input needs (power and critical minerals) and unlock 
new approaches to transportation, storage, and use. Retrofitting existing assets could help scale 
hydrogen-ready infrastructure more rapidly, but comes with its own challenges and substantial 
dedicated infrastructure would still have to be built. 

Scaling hydrogen is hard given 
the amount of specialized 
infrastructure and inputs required.

Note: This research examines 25 significant physical challenges in seven domains at the core of the energy transition, categorized in three levels. 
Level 1 challenges require progress in deploying established technologies and face the least physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require the deployment of known 
technologies to accelerate, and associated infrastructure and inputs to be scaled. Level 3 challenges occur when there are gaps in technological performance 
(often with demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning. The focus is on physical realities because they influence 
the ability to design an interdependent system that has performance comparable to that of the current system and to reduce emissions feasibly. These factors 
influence cost and affordability. Nonphysical factors—notably cost—are important but are not the focus of this research. Assessment of required deployment of 
technologies primarily draws on McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario, which assumes that countries that have committed to net zero (some by 
2050, some later) meet those commitments, and in which warming reaches 1.6ºC relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. This scenario is used because it provides 
sufficient regional and sectoral granularity for assessing required deployment. In some instances, this research also uses scenarios from other sources for reasons 
of data availability.

Under typical decarbonization scenarios, most of the CO2 abatement required to achieve stated 
climate commitments is expected to come from replacing high-emissions technologies with new 
low-emissions ones, including, for instance, replacing cars running on gasoline with electric vehicles 
and replacing gas furnaces with heat pumps. But another opportunity comes from managing the 
emissions footprint of high-emissions assets to reduce overall CO2 emissions. 

This goal could be achieved in three ways, each of which is important to consider. First, energy 
efficiency can be a cheap and relatively quick measure to implement in order to reduce the emissions

of many energy uses, including power generation, transportation, buildings, and industry.649 Second, 
high-emissions assets could be transformed into low-emissions ones through the use of carbon 
capture technologies. Finally, any emissions that continue to occur could be directly removed from 
the atmosphere through carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and, in particular, direct air capture (DAC). 
Each of the three presents a physical challenge.

 — Challenge 23: Expanding energy efficiency (Level 2). The first approach is to ensure greater energy 
efficiency, so that less energy is used overall for a given process. This could include more efficient 
lighting and equipment, improved vehicle fuel efficiency, and industrial-process improvements. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that energy efficiency mitigation options could 
contribute more than five gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent to net emissions reduction by 2030.650 
The pace of energy efficiency improvements would have to grow in most net-zero scenarios. For 
example, in the IEA’s Net Zero scenario, improvements in energy efficiency would need to double, 
from 2 percent a year currently to just above 4 percent on average in the period to 2030.651 This 
challenge is classified as Level 2 because the technologies are mature, but a large transformation 
would be needed to retrofit many millions or even billions of assets, such as industrial sites and 
buildings. This would take time and effort and would come with deployment challenges and upfront 
costs. This challenge is summarized in chapter 2 but not explored further in this chapter.652

 — Challenge 24: Capturing point-source carbon (Level 3). The second approach is capturing any 
residual CO2 that is emitted at point sources, by using carbon capture, utilization, and storage 
(CCUS) technologies. But CCUS is harder to deploy in processes where CO2 is present at lower 
concentrations in flue gases, which is true for the majority of emissions today. Moreover, the 
captured CO2 would need to be transported and stored. Ramping up the use of CCUS would 
require resolving these issues. This is a particularly difficult, Level 3, challenge, defined as having 
a hard use case and a transformation that is only just beginning. That challenge is the focus of 
this chapter. 

 — Challenge 25: Capturing atmospheric carbon (Level 3). The third approach is developing and 

deploying a second distinct but related set of technologies, which include CDR, by capturing carbon 
directly from the atmosphere.653 DAC removes CO2 directly from the atmosphere and could play a 
role alongside nature-based carbon removal (the latter is not explored in this report). DAC currently 
captures only about 0.01 million tonnes of CO2.654 Under the IEA’s Net Zero scenario, the scale-up 
would need to be tremendous—by as much as 1,000 million tonnes by 2050.655 Overall, carbon 
removal technologies are nascent, and their high energy intensity makes their use challenging. This 
challenge is also classified as Level 3, since deployment would have to start from a negligible base 
today, and atmospheric capture could prove to be even harder than point-source capture. Again, this 
challenge is summarized in chapter 2 but is not discussed further in this chapter.

Challenge 24: Capturing point-source carbon (Level 3)
CCUS refers to a group of technologies that, as the name suggests, capture CO2 from industrial and 
power processes—point sources—to prevent it from entering the atmosphere, and then use or store 
it. These technologies have been around for decades. One is amine-based scrubbing, which has 
been used in industrial processes since the 1930s.656

CCUS could be an important tool for advancing the energy transition. In several use cases across the 
energy system, low-emissions technologies may have limitations that prevent them from delivering 
full decarbonization. In industry, for example, deploying technologies to capture carbon could 
be particularly important for reducing process emissions generated in the production of cement 
(Challenge 13), since those emissions would continue to be created even if the use of fossil fuels to 
generate heat in cement production were to be replaced completely. Furthermore, carbon capture 
technologies, if successfully applied, could be used to enable the decarbonization of existing 
infrastructure, avoiding the need for full replacement. Capture units deployed on existing industrial 
emitting equipment, such as hydrogen steam methane reformers, would lower the overall emissions

intensity of the production processes. The captured CO2 could potentially be deployed for other uses, 
for instance to manufacture synthetic fuels and chemicals such as e-methanol (see Sidebar 15, “The 
three stages of the CCUS life cycle”).657

However, various difficulties exist. Despite the fact that many CCUS technologies have been around 
for decades, widespread adoption has been limited. One important reason is that high costs have 
made the business case challenging.658 Fundamental physical challenges remain that relate to 
the effectiveness of technologies and to the storage and use of captured CO2, outlined later. As of 
2022, only about 30 commercial CCUS facilities were operating around the world, mostly in specific 
industrial processes, such as gas processing and ethanol production.659 In all, carbon capture totaled 
about 40 million tonnes of CO2 a year, or only some 0.1 percent of global emissions from the energy 
system.660 Existing facilities include the RasGas CO2 Injection Project in Qatar and the Boundary Dam 
3 in Canada, which could capture 2.2 million and 1.0 million tonnes a year, respectively.661

Overall, then, the use of CCUS remains in its early stages, and its deployment would need to expand 
by a much more significant degree under typical decarbonization scenarios.662 By 2050, the use of 
CCUS would be at least 100 times larger than today’s in McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments 
scenario. More than 4,200 million tonnes of CO2 would potentially need to be captured. However, the 
extent to which CCUS would scale is subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty.663 For CCUS 
to achieve large scale-ups, it would need to overcome physical challenges—most critically, being 
deployed in new processes with lower concentrations of CO2, which would be harder to do.

Sidebar 15. The three stages  
of the CCUS life cycle 

The CCUS life cycle includes capturing 
carbon, transporting it, and finally storing or 
using it.

Capture. Carbon capture from point-source 
emissions separates CO2 from the rest of 
the gases in a flue stream emitted by an 
industrial (or power generation) process. 
There are four main methods for achieving 
this today. Each can be capital-intensive to 
deploy and would require significant amounts 
of energy to run. 

Absorption. CO2 emissions are captured 
through a chemical reaction of the CO2 gas 
with a liquid solvent, such as an amine-
based solvent. This results in a solution that 
contains the absorbed CO2.1 Amine scrubbing 
is a mature technology that has been used 
commercially for more than 40 years. 
However, liquid amine-based solvents do not 
perform as well as solid sorbents at low CO2 
concentrations: the mass of CO2 transported 
is lower, and thus there are smaller effects 
than with solid-sorbent-based technologies.2

Membranes. Permeable or semipermeable 
membranes allow CO2 to pass through while 
blocking other components, thus reducing 
energy consumption, with a lower physical 
and chemical footprint.3 These technologies 

have been used in processes such as natural-
gas sweetening.4 However, they are mostly 
applicable only when the concentration of 
CO2 in the flue gas is high. 

Adsorption. Capture no longer occurs 
using a liquid solvent, but rather with a solid 
compound that has a CO2-reactive agent 
fixed to it. In this approach, CO2 passes over 
the solid sorbent, which separates CO2 from 
flue gases when the gas comes into contact 
with the solid surface.5 This technology has 
not yet been deployed on a large scale, but it 
has the potential to perform better at lower 
CO2 concentrations.6

Oxy-fuel combustion. Fossil fuels are burned 
with pure oxygen instead of air (oxygen is

produced from air using an air separation 
unit).7 Combusting fuels in this way results in 
a flue stream that is purer than one burned 
with air and has a higher concentration of 
CO2, making its capture easier. The CO2 
typically can be separated from the flue gas 
stream using a dehydrator. This technology 
is in its early stages of development, and 
R&D efforts are under way to improve 
performance and system design.8

Several other technologies are in the early 
research and testing phases, including 
cryogenic distillation, ceramic autothermal 
reactors, and chemical looping systems.9

Compression and transportation. Captured 
carbon can be used on site or compressed, 
liquefied, or both in order to be transported 
and stored.10 Pipelines to transport CO2 
have been operating for a long time in the 
oil and gas sector, mainly in the United 

States. Pipelines are the primary and least 
expensive mode of transporting CO2. 
The shipping of liquid and supercritical 
compressed CO2 is an emerging technology 
depending on the new generation of 
tankers, which can expand access to 
storage locations over longer distances.11 
Transportation by rail and truck is generally 
limited to low volumes and short-distance 
applications, given high per-unit costs.12

Storage. CO2 is generally stored by injecting 
compressed CO2 into geological formations, 
such as saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas 
reservoirs, and coal seams.13 It is typically 
stored in a supercritical state, reducing the 
overall volume of CO2 in storage.14 Other 
storage options are being explored, such 
as storage in concrete and in basaltic rock 
formations, where CO2 tends to mineralize 
when in contact with the chemicals in the 
rock.15 Selecting and monitoring storage sites 
is critical for safety and to avoid the risk of 
leakage; large-scale CO2 storage facilities 
have shown that the risk can be mitigated if 
storage is managed effectively.16

Use. Captured CO2 can be employed in 
many ways. Today it is most commonly used 
in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), where it 
is injected into oil reservoirs to increase 
production. About half of the 30 large-scale 
CCUS facilities operating today provide 
CO2 for use in EOR. However, EOR use goes 
hand in hand with continued emissions. 
Moreover, demand for EOR would likely 
not meet demand for CO2 captured 
under typical decarbonization scenarios. 
Therefore, other use cases for captured CO2 
would need to scale. With the potential to 
support decarbonization in other domains 
too, new approaches have started to take 
off, including producing synthetic fuels; 
producing materials such as CO2-cured 
cement and concrete, plastics, chemicals, 
and new materials, including polyethylene 
and polypropylene; and other uses, such 
as urea production, with applications in 
agriculture and food production.17 Additional 
uses matter because they could help with 
the economics of capture and strengthen its 
business case, increasing adoption.

It is harder to deploy CCUS in lower-concentration use cases, but they are the source of  
most emissions
A key physical challenge in scaling the deployment of CCUS is that capturing carbon from flue 
gases with low CO2 concentrations and higher levels of impurities is harder, is more energy-
intensive, and costs more than capturing carbon from flue gases with high CO2 concentrations and 
lower levels of impurities. 

In this report, emissions from industrial and power generation sources fall into three main categories, 
according to concentration levels (Exhibit 40).664 They are (1) high concentrations of CO2, with more 
than 50 percent CO2 concentrations in the flue stream—for instance, in natural gas processing and 
ammonia and ethanol production; (2) intermediate concentrations of 15 to 50 percent in the flue 
stream—for example, in heavy industrial processes such as steel and cement manufacture; and (3) 
low concentrations of less than 15 percent in the flue stream—for example, in coal-fired and natural 
gas–fired power plants.665

All else being equal, the effectiveness of any carbon capture system is inversely related to the 
concentration of CO2 in flue gases. Concentration affects the amount of energy needed, the type of 
technology that can be deployed, and the equipment required to capture CO2.666 Ultimately, these 
factors also affect costs; capturing CO2 in lower concentrations is more expensive. For example, 
capturing emissions during the production of steel, with concentrations between 20 and 30 percent, 
could be three to four times more costly than it is during chemical processing, where concentrations 
are relatively high, at 80 to 90 percent.

Consider energy use. More dilute concentrations require more energy.667 In the case of amine-based 
solutions, for example, lower concentrations of CO2 mean that more heat (and therefore more energy) 
is needed for the separation and recovery of the CO2 from the solution.668

Moreover, the type of technology deployed is also influenced by the concentration of CO2 and affects 
energy consumption. Chemical reactions are often employed to capture CO2 in lower concentrations, 
whereas at higher concentrations the capture could take place via “physical” mechanisms. The CO2 
captured via a chemical reaction is bound more strongly, which would require more energy to undo 
and release the CO2 for use and storage.669

Last, lower concentrations also often require the processing of a larger amount of flue gases 
to obtain the same amount of CO2 captured, which creates the need for larger or more units 
of equipment.670 For example, at lower concentrations, larger assets, such as taller scrubbing 
columns, are required. Lower concentrations also mean more stages, more time, and more packing 
and can require other enhancements in the capture equipment.671 This may also involve ancillary 
equipment, such as multiple heat exchangers, coolers, pumps, and blowers—all raising capital and 
operating costs.

So far, CCUS has been deployed almost exclusively where high concentrations are present, such 
as in the processing of natural gas, ammonia, and ethanol.672 The issue is that high-concentration 
processes account for less than 5 percent of CO2 emissions, with emissions today in the United 
States as an example.

To deploy CCUS on a larger scale would require applications in emissions streams with intermediate 
and low concentrations.673 As discussed, in 2050 about 4,200 million tonnes of CO2 would need to be 
captured in the 2023 McKinsey Achieved Commitments scenario. Of the total that would be captured 
in 2050, more than 60 percent could come from low- and intermediate-concentration point sources. 
The rest is projected to come from high-concentration point sources, mostly the production of low-
emissions hydrogen (which would grow significantly in comparison with today’s production), as well as 
from other high-concentration use cases where CCUS technologies are already mature today.674

CCUS technologies have other operational challenges 
The vast majority of carbon capture processes are not aimed at capturing 100 percent of the CO2 in 
point-source flue gases, because targeting higher capture rates is proportionately more costly. One 
of the reasons for this problem is that many industrial processes have multiple sources of emissions, 
each with its own distinct profile, and this makes it difficult to aggregate these emissions into a single 
stream to be captured. For these reasons, carbon capture is often being considered only for some 
sources of flue gas emissions and not others. In steel, where emissions happen at many points in the 
process, most target capture rates being considered range from about 50 to 90 percent.675

Moreover, operational challenges and risks surrounding first-of-their-kind plants—for instance, 
risks such as a lack of operational experience—often prevent CCUS facilities from achieving target 
capture rates and mean that effective capture rates are lower. For example, effective capture rates in 
some projects have been about 30 percentage points lower than expected when the projects were 
designed.676 Other operational issues that have an impact on effective capture include unscheduled 
downtime: the amount of time that the operating facility is not capturing carbon. 

Issues that arise in the storage stage can affect capture rates, too. They include clogging of injection 
wells, issues with monitoring instrumentation, and leakage of storage sites. 

Advances in CCUS technologies could address capture issues
A number of advances in CCUS technologies address issues in the capture stage, including capture 
at low concentrations and establishing operational best practices. A number of developing CCUS 
industry consortia share experience and best practices.677

To tackle the issue of capture in lower concentrations, several projects are under way from R&D 
to pilot, with plans to launch over the next five years.678 In the case of absorption processes, 
improvements are in the works to reduce the energy consumption of recovering captured CO2—
for example, using sterically hindered amines that form weaker bonds with the captured CO2 
and therefore require less energy to break them.679 In adsorption processes, innovations in solid 
sorbents are promising. Solid sorbents have been used since the 1990s on the International Space 
Station to remove CO2 at very low concentrations from the ambient air.680 The level of focus has also 
increased on new approaches to capture CO2—for example, oxy-fuel processes that result in higher-
concentration CO2 streams, where the carbon is easier to capture. Industrial-process reengineering 
to create purer CO2 streams is also happening in cement production, where the LEILAC project 
aims to electrify part of the heating process, thereby creating a pure CO2 stream that arises from 
process emissions, which would be easier to capture (see chapter 7).681 While these approaches are 
promising, additional exploration through more and higher-scale applications is needed to determine 
their efficacy. 

R&D investment in CCUS technologies and project deployment can accelerate advances in capture 
rates at low concentrations and help to address operational issues. The United Kingdom announced 
a £20 billion investment to strengthen its CCUS market.682 In the United States, the Energy Act of 
2020, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included 
investments in research and offered deployment incentives for CCUS technologies.683 This program 
includes authorization for various carbon management and removal programs, such as large-scale 
pilot projects and commercial-scale demonstrations in heavy industry, the development of large-
scale storage projects, and the establishment of a carbon utilization program.

Once captured, a massive amount of carbon needs to be transported and used or stored 
If carbon capture scaled up, the carbon would have to be transported and used or stored. A large 
scale-up of supporting infrastructure would be needed. 

 — Transportation. CO2 can be transported by pipeline, ship, truck, and rail, and the technology 
to transport gases or liquids via these methods is fairly mature. However, transportation 
infrastructure needs to scale up enormously to support CCUS technologies by 2050, and this 
effort remains at an early stage, especially in the case of shipping and rail.684 According to the 
IEA’s Net Zero scenario, between 30,000 and 50,000 kilometers of pipelines would be needed 
to transport CO2 by 2030, which is a 2.0 to 3.5 times increase from the 14,500 kilometers now 
under development.685 Today, 85 percent of CO2 pipelines are located in the United States.686 
More pipeline infrastructure would be needed elsewhere to support global growth in CCUS 
applications. Similarly, shipping is emerging for large-scale transportation but remains limited.687

 — Use. The most mature use case for captured carbon thus far, as noted, is enhanced oil recovery, 
or EOR. However, as also noted, use of EOR continues to produce emissions. Together with the 
fact that demand for EOR would not be likely to match demand for CO2 captured under typical 
decarbonization scenarios, this means that other use cases for captured CO2 would need to scale. 
Additional uses that have started to take off could increase the business case for CCUS and help 
with the economics of capture. They could further reduce emissions if the captured carbon was 
used to displace fossil fuels. These applications would range from use in construction materials, 
such as cement and plastics, to the creation of synthetic fuels for aviation or shipping.688 While 
their development would accelerate adoption of CCUS by strengthening the business case, today 
their high manufacturing cost and power intensity often limit feasibility (absent a market premium 
or regulatory support), as is the case with synthetic fuel.

 — Storage. High-level geological analysis suggests that the world has ample CO2 storage 
capacity—even accounting for accessibility, commercial viability, land use, and public 
acceptance—mostly in deep saline formations and depleted oil and gas fields. Current estimates 
of available storage capacity range between 8,000 gigatonnes and 55,000 gigatonnes.689 This 
by far exceeds the estimates of what is required from today to 2050 in McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved 
Commitments scenario.690 However, further study is required to ensure the long-term durability 
and permanence of the storage sites.

Different implementation models could address transportation, use, and storage challenges
With a few exceptions, most CCUS projects to date have been developed and operated by a single 
entity, which transports CO2 from one capture facility to a single injection site. An alternative 
approach would be to share infrastructure between emitters and those who provide CCUS services. 
In such business models, separate entities would deal with carbon capture, transportation, and 
storage.691 This approach could be effective because it would expand opportunities for CCUS and 
unlock scale benefits by aggregating a larger stable volume of CO2. New projects that have been 
announced attempt to do this. In total, more than 140 CCUS hubs were in development as of 2023—
more than three times as many as in 2021—with most of the activity concentrated in Europe and 
North America.692

Increased collaboration could also support the expansion of carbon capture. Projects are now relying 
on partnerships between private and public entities. For example, Porthos (the Port of Rotterdam 
CO2 Transport Hub and Offshore Storage project) aims to capture CO2 emitted by industrial 
facilities located in the port of Rotterdam and to transport and sequester the CO2 by injecting it 
into a depleted natural-gas reservoir in the North Sea. Porthos, a partnership between the Port 
of Rotterdam Authority and energy companies Gasunie and EBN, is enabled with EU funding.693 
Similarly, the Northern Lights project, a partnership among Equinor, Shell, and Total, is the first 
cross-border CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure network. It complements Longship,

which is the government of Norway’s large-scale carbon capture and storage project at a cement 
factory.694 Together, such joint efforts and their sharing of risks and costs (as well as streamlining of 
interdependencies) could support investments in these technologies. Learning from operations and 
sharing the know-how developed by executing large-scale CCUS projects can help to accelerate 
successful deployment in the future. 

§ § §

Capturing point-source carbon is a Level 3 challenge. If CCUS is to serve as an important 
decarbonization lever, physical challenges in applying it to use cases with lower concentrations of 
CO2 must be overcome. Carbon capture would potentially need to scale up more than 100 times 
by 2050, and even more than that in lower-concentration streams. New capture technologies and 
processes could help to deliver the performance required by these use cases, but many of them 
remain in the early stages of deployment. Moreover, a high degree of transformation (in the form of 
a significant scale-up of CCUS facilities and supporting infrastructure, such as pipelines and ports) 
would be required. 

If CCUS is to serve as an important 
decarbonization lever, physical 
challenges in applying it to use 
cases with lower concentrations 
of CO2 must be overcome.

gigatons in agriculture, forestry, and other land use. 
In the case of methane, more than approximately 
35 percent of global emissions arise from the energy 
system, from combustion and industrial processes, 
with the remaining 65 percent divided between 
agriculture, at about 40 percent, and waste and 
other sectors, at about 25 percent (data for 2021).

18  This report typically uses the 2023 McKinsey 
Achieved Commitments scenario to define 
progress made to date and the magnitude of the 
transformation needed. This scenario provides 
detail across different economies and types of 
assets about the deployment levels that would be 
required for those economies to meet the climate 
commitments they have made. This scenario 
assumes that countries that have committed to 
net zero (some by 2050, some later) meet those 
commitments and that warming reaches 1.6ºC 
relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. See Global 
energy perspective 2023, McKinsey, October 
2023. Other net-zero scenarios may contain slightly 
different combinations of technologies and rates 
of deployment, but the broad trends and themes 
described in this research would still apply. This 
report is based on analysis as of September 2023. 
Subsequent developments in the energy system may 
lead to different outcomes, which will be covered in 
forthcoming McKinsey research.

In the case of fertilizer, natural gas is a feedstock for 
most of today’s production of ammonia, which is in 
turn used in nitrogen-based fertilizers. In the case 
of steel, while coking coal is the most commonly 
used fossil fuel, natural gas can also be used as a 
reductant in direct iron reduction processes. In the 
case of plastics, natural gas is used as feedstock in 
many regions, as a source of ethane.

34  Among the other important issues that relate to the 
current energy system are energy security risks, in 
particular for economies that lack domestic energy 
supply; and the system’s contribution to air pollution 
and other pollution. While important, these issues 
are not highlighted in this report whose focus is 
the energy transition arising from the system’s 
production of greenhouse gas emissions. Estimates 
of impact of air pollution vary widely, but many 
studies cite five million to ten million premature 
deaths per year as a result. See “Fossil fuel air 
pollution responsible for 1 in 5 deaths worldwide,”

In many countries, and for specific communities, 
energy and associated sectors are also a source of 
jobs and economic activity. Transforming the current 
system therefore also has the potential to affect 
these parts of the world disproportionately, and 
stakeholders will need to consider how to manage 
the transition for these regions. For further detail, 
see The net-zero transition: What it would cost,  
what it could bring, McKinsey Global Institute, 
January 2022.

In some cases, the cost of individual low-emissions 
assets may also be lower than that of high-emissions 
ones. The most common example of this is the 
levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) generation from 
solar and wind onshore, which can be lower than 
fossil-fuel-based power generation’s. However, 
LCOE comparisons are an incomplete means 
to compare technologies with very different 
generation profiles (such as solar in comparison 
to gas generation). For example, LCOE does not 
factor in additional system integration costs (such 
as the need for storage or impacts on the utilization 
rate of existing thermal assets) or the value of the 
contribution of different generation assets to the 
overall power system. These aspects and others 
would need to be evaluated to design affordable 
energy systems. For more detail, see chapter 5 
of this report and “Batteries and secure energy 
transitions,” in World energy outlook special report, 
IEA, April 2024; Levelized costs of new generation 
resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2023, US 
Energy Information Administration, April 2023; 
2023 Levelized Cost Of Energy+, Lazard, 2023; and 
Projected costs of generating electricity, IEA and 
Nuclear Energy Agency, December 2020.

44  Gas-fired peaking plants are designed to balance 
fluctuating power in the electricity network, 
operating when demand is high and the electricity 
supply falls short.

45  The capacity factor of a generation asset indicates 
what share of the time it is generating power. It is 
calculated by dividing output over a period by the 
maximum possible output if the asset were running 
at full capacity continuously over the same period. 
See Land-based wind market report: 2023 edition, 
Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, US 
Department of Energy, August 2023; and McKinsey 
Battery Insights. High-emissions technologies also 
improve over time, and the relative performance of 
the system as a whole depends on improvements 
across both low- and high-emissions technologies. 
See Vehicle fuel economy in major markets 2005–
2019, IEA, August 2021. For example, the mileage of 
ICEs in the United States has roughly doubled in the 
past 50 years.

47  Raw materials encompass a wide range of physical 
elements, including minerals, fossil fuels, and 
agricultural and forestry products. This research 
focuses on critical minerals for the energy 
transition, defined as those that are essential for 
the development and deployment of low-emissions 
energy and technologies, and that may be in high 
demand while limited in their availability during the 
energy transition.

48  CO2 emissions in 2023: A new record high, but is 

there light at the end of the tunnel?, IEA, March 

49  This research uses primary energy here because 
it is a widely available global metric that gives a 
rough indication of current contributions of different 
energy sources to the energy system and therefore 
helps gauge the scale of the future transformation 
that is needed. But there are limitations to 
comparisons of primary energy contributions 
from fossil fuels and other energy sources, given 
that most energy contained in fossil fuels is lost in 
conversions. Today, almost 70 percent of primary 
energy in the United States is lost in energy 
conversions, with only 30 percent being converted 
into useful energy. While the primary energy metric 
used by the Energy Institute cited here accounts 
for some of the conversion losses by using a 
substitution method, use losses are not factored 
in. During the energy transition, therefore, not all 
primary energy supply would need to be replaced 
one-for-one, given that many electrification 
technologies have higher end-use efficiencies 
with less conversion loss. See Primary energy 
consumption as of 2022, Energy Institute, accessed 
May 2024; and Energy flow charts, Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory, 2022.

51  Share of deployment is used to understand the 

current state of the transition and to understand the 
nature of what lies ahead. Of course, today’s low-
emissions stock of assets may not exist by 2050 (for 
example, some assets may have lifetimes of ten or 
15 years and would need to be replaced before then), 
and some of today’s high-emissions assets could 
also be naturally turned over between now and 2050 
as they reach the end of their useful life. Moreover, 
the energy system is expected to grow, and some  
of the deployment required in 2050 is driven by 
growth and not solely by the substitution of existing 
low-emissions assets. Nonetheless, this measure  
of today’s deployment of low-emissions assets 
relative to the deployment needed by 2050 is a 
helpful indication of the degree of transformation 
that has been accomplished to date, how far along 
the energy transition is, and the scale of future 
transformation needed.

weather conditions. They are nuclear, hydropower, 
geothermal, and power plants with carbon capture, 
among others. See Jesse D. Jenkins, Max Luke,

61  EVs refers to battery EVs (BEVs) and fuel-cell EVs 

(FCEVs). BEVs are powered by electricity stored in a

Chapter 2

73  EV range is the distance that a vehicle can drive 

from a full to empty battery. The US Environmental 
Protection Agency tests vehicles in a laboratory 
setting, and real-world ranges will likely differ due 
to driving behaviors and use of ancillaries, such as 
air conditioning. See Fuel economy and EV range 
testing, US Environmental Protection Agency, 
November 2023; and US: Median EPA range of 
2022 BEVs amounted to 257 miles, Inside EVs,  
May 2023. Fast charging depends on the vehicle 
and the charging infrastructure. Best-in-class BEVs 
can recharge sufficiently to give them a range of 
100 kilometers in about five to ten minutes when 
using a fast charger. Average BEVs take about 
ten to 15 minutes for the same driving range. With 
slow-charging technology, it can take as much as 
six hours. See “Most fast charging electric vehicles,” 
Electric Vehicle Database, accessed May 26, 2024; 
and Charger types and speeds, US Department of 
Transportation, June 2023.  

74  The effective range of BEVs may be 20 percent  

lower than reported under normal driving conditions. 
In extreme cold weather, this figure may reach  
as much as 30 percent. The median range of a BEV—
even considering a buffer of 30 percent—would 
enable 70 percent or more of US households to 
complete their long single-day journeys (more than 
100 kilometers) without stopping to recharge on the 
vast majority of days in the year (more than 360).

81  This research maps current CO2 emissions to 

different energy-producing and energy-consuming 
sectors. Level 3 challenges associated with 
enablers, such as hydrogen or carbon capture, are 
accounted for within the domains that would rely on 
such enablers to abate current emissions. 

82  About 30 to 60 percent of total power system 
emissions are classified as Level 3. This 
quantification of power system emissions tied to 
Level 3 challenges is based on the share of potential 
emissions that could be abated by deploying VRE at 
levels at which managing their variability becomes 
harder. For more detail, see the discussion later in 
this chapter. 

83  About one-third to half of the emissions of the 
industrial domain are classified as Level 3. The 
quantification here of the industrial emissions tied 
to Level 3 challenges considers two additional 
aspects. The first is the share of the abatement 
of these four industrial materials that could still 
be achieved using existing mature technologies; 
for example, using clinker substitutes to reduce 
emissions associated with cement. The emissions 
reduction associated with such measures is not 
counted in this report’s quantification of emissions 
associated with Level 3 challenges. The second is 
the emissions associated with “other industries” 
that nonetheless rely on Level 3 challenges (that is, 
related to the decarbonization of the power domain) 
being solved. For example, the electrification of 
heating technologies in these other industries 
would rely to some extent on solving the Level 3 
challenge of variability in the power grid, and some 
portion of their emissions is therefore counted in 
the Level 3 quantification. 

84  Abating some emissions associated with 
the decarbonization of passenger vehicle 
transportation relies on solving Level 3 challenges 
in the power domain, since reaching their full 
emission abatement potential would rely on running 
on a decarbonized grid.

85  Others have made similar assessments, primarily 
considering how much emissions reduction would 
rely on technologies at different stages of maturity. 
For example, analysis by the IEA and McKinsey finds 
that 35 to 45 percent of the emissions reduction 
required by 2050 in a net-zero scenario would 
come from technologies that are not yet available 
in the market; they are in the concept, prototype, 
or demonstration stage. In this report, many Level 
3 challenges rely on technologies that typically are 
classified as being in these more nascent stages of 
maturity. The IEA figure corresponds to technologies 
in the concept, prototype, and demonstration 
phases, while the McKinsey Platform for Climate

guide, IEA, September 14, 2023. 

87  This analysis assumes that deploying VREs beyond 
the point at which they make up more than 50 to 
70 percent of all generation is a Level 3 challenge.  
At a global level, this equates to about 30 to 
60 percent of the total emissions arising within the 
power domain being associated with tackling a Level 
3 challenge. The quantification is based on analyses 
that examine the magnitude of VRE penetration 
at which required supply-side flexibility either 
significantly increases in amount or nature (through, 
for example, increases in longer-duration flexibility 
needs). Overall two quantification approaches 
were undertaken. The first approach is based on a 
literature review, which considers a wide range of 
sources that evaluate how flexibility needs evolve 
at higher penetrations of VRE as a share of total 
generation. They evaluate metrics such as total need 
for flexibility, total cost of flexibility, or the different 
types or duration of flexibility options required. 
For example, see How much storage do we need? 
Storage Lab, accessed June 2024; Energy storage 
– Underpinning a decarbonized and secure EU 
energy system, European Commission, March 14, 
2023; Net-zero power: Long duration energy storage

Council and McKinsey, November 2021; T. Brown 
and L. Reichenberg, “Decreasing market value of 
variable renewables can be avoided by policy action,” 
Energy Economics, volume 100, August 2021; and 
Conrad Nichols, When and why is long duration 
energy storage technology needed? IDTechEx, 
February 1, 2024. The second approach is based 
on McKinsey Power Model simulations of the total 
amount and type of supply-side flexibility needed 
for a sample of advanced and emerging economies. 
These simulations included evaluating the point of 
VRE deployment at which various forms of flexibility 
needed to start to grow more quickly; and at which 
novel forms of flexibility (such as novel long-duration 
energy storage [LDES] and hydrogen turbines) 
would start to account for a more material share of 
the total flexibility mix (considering as an example 
a threshold of 10 percent of the total flexibility mix). 
Given the inherent uncertainty associated with how 
required flexibility could evolve over time and across 
countries, these figures were calibrated for different 
economies according to their individual profiles and 
considered a range of potential results, rather than 
precise point estimates. 

88  Electric vehicles and heat pumps rely on a low-

emissions grid to fully reach their decarbonization 
potential and therefore rely on solving the Level 3 
challenges in the power domain.

89  Demand-side flexibility is explored as part of 

Challenge 3.

90  Flexibility is defined in this context as total flexible 
capacity divided by average power demand. 
Flexible capacity includes dispatchable generation 
assets running at low utilization (benchmarked 
against 50 percent utilization), interconnections, 
and storage. For example, from 2022 to 2050, 
flexibility would need to grow twice as fast as overall 

power demand in Italy, and seven times faster 
in India. Simulations are based on the McKinsey 
Power Model, using the McKinsey 2023 Achieved 
Commitments scenario.

is measured by emissions from the electrical

104  Global EV outlook, IEA, April 2024.

105  EV range is the distance that a vehicle can drive 

from a full to empty battery. The US Environmental 
Protection Agency tests vehicles in a laboratory 
setting, and real-world ranges will likely differ due 
to driving behaviors and use of ancillaries, such as 
air conditioning. See Fuel economy and EV range 
testing, US Environmental Protection Agency, 
November 2023; and US: Median EPA range of 
2022 BEVs amounted to 257 miles, Inside EVs, May 
2023. Fast charging depends on the vehicle and the 
charging infrastructure. Best-in-class BEVs can 
recharge sufficiently to give them a range of 100 
kilometers in about five to ten minutes when using a 
fast charger. Average BEVs take about ten to fifteen 
minutes for the same driving range. With slow-
charging technology, it can take as long as six hours. 
See “Most fast charging electric vehicles,” Electric 
Vehicle Database; and Charger types and speeds, 
US Department of Transportation, June 2023.

106  The effective range of BEVs may be 20 percent lower 
than reported under normal driving conditions. In 
extreme cold weather, this figure may reach as much 
as 30 percent. See McKinsey Center for Future 
Mobility; and Matthias Steinsträter, Tobias Heinrich,

118  The physical challenges currently associated with 

these industries also mean the production costs 
of many of the new processes being investigated 
are higher than for conventional processes. 
Decarbonizing the production of high-temperature 
heat is generally harder than decarbonizing low- 
and medium-temperature heat. Electrification, 
in particular, is often more difficult for two main 
reasons. First, a narrower set of low-emissions 
technologies can deliver high heat. For example, 
heat pumps and mechanical vapor recompression 
evaporators can only reach temperatures of 
about 250 to 300°C. Second, the delivery of 
higher-temperature heat can require larger asset 
reconfigurations, because the form of heat transfer 
often needs to change.

process in some cases, but it accounts for less than

125  Other operational challenges related to the scale-up

They include the need to scale up manufacturing 
capacity for heat pumps, whether sufficient skilled 
labor is available to install them, whether consumers 
adopt them given their associated costs, and the 
large turnover that their installation would entail. 

126  Duncan Gibb et al., “Coming in from the cold: Heat 

pump efficiency at low temperatures,” Joule, volume 
7, issue 9, September 2023. The efficiency of a heat 
pump is measured by the coefficient of performance 
(COP), which typically ranges from two to five for 
heat pumps, meaning that for every unit of electrical 
energy consumed, the heat pump is able to deliver 
two to five units of heat. For further context, see

129  This is based on a study that compares current

in the United States. It calculates peak demand 
over the course of a year in such a scenario, relative 
to today’s peak demand, assuming that a top-
performing heat pump (90th percentile) is used. 
The analysis does not consider other potential 
growth of energy demand across domains, for 
example due to population growth or electrification 
of mobility or industry. See Michael Waite and Vijay 
Modi, “Electricity load implications of space heating 
decarbonization pathways,” Joule, volume 4, issue 2,

145  Summary for policymakers, Climate change 

2022: Mitigation of climate change, IPCC, 2022. 
In this analysis, energy efficiency includes the 
following mitigation options: avoiding demand for 
energy services; efficient lighting, appliances, and 
equipment; fuel efficiency in light- and heavy-duty 
vehicles; efficiency and optimization in shipping; and 
energy efficiency in aviation and industry.

146  The rebound effect of energy efficiency happens 

when gains in energy efficiency prompt consumers 
to use more energy in some cases, and therefore 
energy demand falls less than it would have 
otherwise. Estimates of rebound effects vary 
significantly, but the literature agrees that they are 
probably well below 100 percent—improving energy 
efficiency still leads to overall savings in energy. 
See Kenneth Gillingham, David Rapson, and Gernot 
Wagner, “The rebound effect and energy efficiency 
policy,” Review of Environmental Economics and 
Policy, volume 10, number 1, winter 2016; and Paul 
E. Brockway et al., “Energy efficiency and economy-
wide rebound effects: A review of the evidence and 
its implications,” Renewable and Sustainable Energy 
Reviews, volume 141, May 2021. Moreover, empirical 
evidence suggests that realized cost savings may 
be substantially lower than modeled ones for 
specific energy-efficiency programs, particularly 
those related to retrofitting homes. Therefore, 
stakeholders seeking to improve energy efficiency 
should carefully assess which measures will actually 
result in savings. See Meredith Fowlie, Michael

166  The IEA classifies households as those that have 
access to electricity by being connected to an 
electricity grid or through a renewable standalone 
system or minigrid connection with sufficient 
capacity to deliver a minimum bundle of energy 
services. This includes the powering of several light 
bulbs, phone charging, a radio, and potentially a 
fan or television. See Electricity, IEA, accessed July 
2024; and Access to electricity improves slightly 
in 2023, but still far from the pace needed to meet 
SDG7, IEA, September 2023.

281  This is based solely on tailpipe emissions; if upstream 
emissions from fuel production (drilling, refining, and 
transportation) were included, the figure could be 
closer to three kilograms of CO2. See Comparison: 
Your car vs. an electric vehicle, US Environmental

282  The focus of this challenge is BEVs rather than 

FCEVs because, in the case of passenger vehicles, 
BEV adoption is more than 100 times that of FCEVs. 
This is not to say that FCEVs will not play a role in 
decarbonizing passenger road mobility, but most 
scenarios, including McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved 
Commitments scenario, expect BEVs rather than 
FCEVs to drive the decarbonization of passenger 
vehicles. Also see, for example, Net zero roadmap:

284  The lower-emissions grid is based on the US power

287  Running emissions are those emitted when a vehicle 
is in use and do not include emissions associated 
with a car’s manufacture. For top-performing ICEs, 
this figure assumes the 95th percentile of passenger 
vehicle tailpipe emissions and a fuel efficiency 
of approximately 35 miles per gallon, as well as 
upstream emissions associated with fuel production. 
It also assumes an average BEV fuel efficiency of 
95 miles per gallon-equivalent. The calculation 
is based on the current intensity of the US grid, 
including upstream emissions. See fueleconomy.gov,

Protection Agency, accessed May 2024; Climate 
Transparency Report 2022, Climate Transparency, 
October 2022; and Life cycle upstream emission 
factors (pilot edition), IEA, accessed June 2024.

288  This depends on the emissions intensity of the power 

grid mix used to charge the BEV.

289  The emissions intensities of the power grids, 

including upstream emissions, are 429 grams of 
CO2-equivalent per kilowatt-hour in the left panel 
(United States) and 841 grams of CO2-equivalent per 
kilowatt-hour in the right panel (India). See Climate

311  Fast charging depends on the vehicle and the 

charging infrastructure. Average BEVs take ten to 15 
minutes to give them a range of 100 kilometers. With 
slow-charging technology, it can take as much as six 
hours.  See “Most fast charging electric vehicles,” 
Electric Vehicle Database, accessed June 2024; 
and “Charger types and speeds,” US Department 
of Transportation, June 2023. FCEVs take about 
one minute. As in the prior challenge, because BEV 
adoption is much higher than that of FCEVs, and 
BEVs are expected to be the primary solution for 
passenger vehicles, this research focuses on them 
rather than on FCEVs.

312  EV range is the distance that a vehicle can drive from 
a full to an empty battery. The US Environmental 
Protection Agency tests vehicles in a laboratory 
setting. See Fuel economy and EV range testing, US 
Environmental Protection Agency, November 2023; 
and “US: Median EPA range of 2022 BEVs amounted 
to 257 miles,” Inside EVs, May 2023.

313  Under normal driving conditions, the effective 
range of BEVs may be 20 percent lower than 
reported. In extremely cold weather, this figure 
may reach as high as 30 percent. See McKinsey

326  Guidance report: Electric trucks where they  

adjusted downward by 30 percent to account for the 
loss of range. For reference, about 90 percent of 
households would have to stop to recharge less than 
ten times per year, and 20 percent of households 
would never have to stop to recharge.

315  This analysis is based on adapted data from the US 
Federal Highway Administration on household trips 
measured as the number of days per household. 
Other researchers have reached similar conclusions, 
for instance suggesting that the latest BEV models 
could cover more than 95 percent of typical daily 
trips in Germany and the United States. See

327  The payload-distance relationship is based on a 

2022 International Council on Clean Transportation 
simulation that used EU trucking regulations from 
2019 as a regulatory baseline. These regulations 
allow zero-emission powertrains to weigh two tonnes

and fuel cell systems. Proposals are currently in 
place over increasing the allowance to four tonnes.

aims to transport as much as 30 percent of road 
freight carried farther than 300 kilometers using 
other modes, such as rail and boat. See Raphaëlle 
Chapuis, Theo Delporte, Steffen Köpke, Carsten 
Lotz, and Anselm Ott, “Bold moves to boost 
European rail freight,” McKinsey, January 2022. 

330  The proportion of long-haul heavy-duty trucking 

use cases that could be unmet by BEVs on a single 
charge is estimated by combining the EU payload-
distance relationship with the US distributions 
of gross vehicle weight and distance-driven (this 
combination is due to data availability reasons). 
These distributions show, for example, that more 
than half of this US trucking segment carries up 
to 18,000 kilograms in payload on a typical daily 
journey, and that a similar proportion travels up 
to around 700 kilometers daily. Today, US federal 
trucking weight regulations are generally stricter 
than those in the EU, and the US profile tends involve 
heavier payloads and longer distances. Therefore, if 
certain US journeys are unmet under EU regulations, 
they are also unmet under US federal regulations. 
Fleet payloads and distances are based on 2018 
survey results from North America. See Hussein 
Basma and Felipe Rodríguez, Fuel cell electric tractor-
trailers: Technology overview and fuel economy,

382  For example, in the case of lower/medium 

temperature heat, heat is often delivered in the form 
of steam. Reconfiguration is then more limited to the 
mechanism to create the steam itself.

383  See Arnout de Pee, Dickon Pinner, Occo Roelofsen, 

Ken Somers, Eveline Speelman, and Maaike 
Witteveen, “Decarbonization of industrial sectors: 
The next frontier,” McKinsey, June 2018. Industrial 
emissions from burning fossil fuels for these four 
industries account for 55 percent of total industrial 
emissions and come from the generation of high-
temperature heat (35 percent), the generation of 
medium- or low-temperature heat and other fossil 
fuel uses on the industrial site (13 percent), and 
machine drive—using fossil fuels to fuel machines 
that, for instance, grind feedstocks in the production 
of cement or run compressors (7 percent). 

384  Aluminum is the exception. Its production requires 
temperatures exceeding 1,000°C. However, unlike 
the big four industrial materials, most of this high-
temperature energy demand is already delivered 
through electricity. See “Aluminum decarbonization 
at a cost that makes sense,” McKinsey, April 2023.

399  The fact that scrap steel may contain contaminants

404  This process can also use higher-emissions power 
sources, but then the carbon savings in comparison 
with BF-BOF would be lower.

405  BF-BOF plants typically have a power plant 

where off-gases from the blast furnaces are used 
to generate power, and therefore these plants 
purchase little to no power from the grid. See “The

hydrogen, the only byproduct is water, and therefore 
almost all emissions are abated. Residual emissions 
are indirect ones from the electricity used. In the

CO2 being released, albeit less than in the case of

episode seven: The electric smelting furnace,

of an EAF as in the previous pathway is that the 
BOF manages to further remove impurities more 
effectively than an EAF.

417  The BOF is used in this process to enable further 

purification of the resulting steel. Both the premelter 
and BOF emissions in this process would be limited. 
The BOF step accounts for a comparatively low share 
of emissions (less than 10 percent of the total). As for 
the premelter, using low-emissions power would lead 
to low emissions from this step.

471  Each cycle can degrade the polymer’s quality, 

leading to weaker, less-versatile plastics. This limit 
is due to the physical and chemical changes the 
polymers undergo during the recycling process. 
Chemical recycling can potentially overcome these 
limitations. It breaks down polymers into their 
monomers or other basic chemicals, effectively 
resetting the material’s properties. This process 
allows for the potential to recycle plastics 
indefinitely, as the fundamental building blocks 
can be reconstituted into new polymers without 
degradation of quality.

478  This approach is different from the previously 

discussed use of biobased feedstocks to produce 
plastics. While in the former approach, the plastics 
are chemically identical to their fossil-fuel-based 
counterparts and therefore exhibit the same 
properties, in this case the material being produced 
is different and would display different properties.

499  This share of heat provided by electricity is in terms 
of pre-efficiency useful heat in terajoules, as per 
McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments scenario.

500  District heating includes more centralized solutions 
to generate and distribute heat to buildings, such 
as geothermal solutions and using waste heat 
from power plants or industrial sites. Solar thermal 
technology consists of harnessing solar energy 
and can be used to heat water or air in buildings. 
It is important to note that these solutions cannot 
be rolled out in all situations. For instance, district 
heating requires a central heating source, such as 
surplus heat from industry, and solar thermal may 
not be appropriate for geographies with low solar 
irradiance. See Building decarbonization: How 
electric heat pumps could help reduce emissions 
today and going forward, McKinsey, July 2022;

emissions from harder-to-abate sectors by mid-
century, Energy Transitions Commission, November 
2018; and Space heating, IEA, September 2023. 

501  On the supply side, estimates suggest that global 
heat pump manufacturing capacity would need 
to quadruple in 2030 to meet projected demand 
in a net-zero scenario. The expansion of capacity 
indicated by publicly announced projects falls 
short of this goal, but short lead times of one 
to three years for manufacturing expansion or 
construction of new factories could minimize the 
gap. See Energy technology perspectives 2023, 
IEA, January 2023. In terms of other operational 
constraints, a key limit on installing heat pumps in 
new and existing buildings as well as carrying out 
the retrofits required to ensure heat pumps perform 
effectively (such as changing ductwork, pipes, or 
radiators) in existing homes is the availability of 
skilled labor. Another constraint relates to consumer 
adoption of heat pumps, which can be influenced by 
high up-front costs and, in the case of the existing 
stock of buildings, by the friction associated with 
transforming legacy heating and cooling systems. 
Such operational challenges would also need  
to be addressed.

502  The level of emissions saved by adopting heat 

pumps depends on a number of factors, such as 
the emissions intensity of the power grid and the 
refrigerant used. One common refrigerant, R-410a, 
is being phased out because of its high global 
warming potential. This research does not discuss 
refrigerants in detail because lower-emissions 
options are available and under development.

512  At a certain temperature, the heat capacity a 

heat pump can deliver may fall below the heating 
load, which means that either a larger (potentially 
oversize) or a better-performing heat pump or a 
backup source of heat would be required. See Cold 
climate air source heat pump, Minnesota Commerce 
Department, November 2017. The exact temperature 
threshold at which heating capacity falls below the 
heating load varies, but as a rule, heat pumps are 
sized to operate at a COP of at least two.

515  For example, if a local utility generates electricity 

with a combined-cycle natural gas power plant and 
50 percent energy efficiency, the efficiency of the 
heat provided by a heat pump with a COP of two 
would be 100 percent. In comparison, the average 
efficiency of a gas furnace is 80 to 97 percent

generation for both cases, excluding natural gas

542  Raw materials encompass a wide range of physical 
elements, including minerals, fossil fuels, and 
agricultural and forestry products. This research 
focuses on critical minerals for the energy 
transition, defined as those that are essential for 
the development and deployment of low-emissions 
energy and technologies, and that may be in high 
demand while limited in their availability during the 
energy transition.

544  The net-zero materials transition: Implications 
for global supply chains, McKinsey, July 2023. 
McKinsey’s Achieved Commitments scenario 
assumes that net-zero commitments are  
achieved by 2050 by leading economies through 
purposeful policies and implies a 1.6°C rise in  
global temperatures by 2100.

545  Rare earth minerals are abundant in the Earth’s  

crust but typically are dispersed. This often means 
that they lack the concentration necessary for  
viable mining.

546  Under McKinsey’s 2023 Achieved Commitments 
scenario, the pace of growth of all eight critical 
minerals is slower after 2030 than it is anticipated 
to be from now to 2030. In the case of lithium, for 
instance, the pace would drop from about 25 percent 
per year through 2030 to about 10 percent per year 
from 2030 to 2050.

547  The research is anchored on the McKinsey 

MineSpans database, which contains more than 
10,000 operating mines and mining projects in 
more than 130 economies. McKinsey MineSpans’ 
base case of supply includes all operating mines 
(corrected for depletion and expected closure where 
relevant), and a selection of projects currently under 
construction or at the feasibility stage—in most 
cases with financing confirmed.

548  McKinsey MineSpans’ high case of supply includes, 

for example, some projects in the feasibility stage 
with no financing confirmed, and with adjustments 
for potential delays. Potential imbalances between 
required demand and projected supply are classified 
into three categories. “High imbalance” corresponds 
to cases in which demand is more than 50 percent 
higher than projected supply. “Medium imbalance” 
corresponds to cases where demand is more 
than 10 percent higher than supply but less than 
50 percent. “No or low imbalance” corresponds to 
cases where demand is lower than supply or higher 
by less than 10 percent.

relative to preindustrial levels by 2100. See Global

tonnes of hydrogen were estimated to be required 
by 2050, an increase of two to six times from 
today’s total production. This is based on a range of

of projected warming above preindustrial levels. See

598  In the case of steel, carbon capture and direct 

electrification (for example, molten ore electrolysis) 
could also be possible, but they are expected to 
account for a smaller share of production than 
hydrogen-based steelmaking (see chapter 7 on 
the industry domain). In the case of shipping and 
aviation, biofuels are also expected to play a role, but 
could face limitations due to availability of feedstock. 
See “Global energy perspective 2023: Sustainable 
fuels outlook,” McKinsey, January 2024.

599  When electrolyzers are used intermittently, that 

share is about 25 to 45 percent, and up to 70 percent 
if they are used more continuously. See Global

In this section, by convention, we display efficiencies 
based on the HHV of hydrogen. This value 
corresponds to the energy released when burning 
hydrogen with oxygen, considering the latent heat 
of the resulting water vapor that could be recovered. 
Note that some sources refer to the lower heating 
value (LHV) of hydrogen when presenting efficiency 
calculations. Hydrogen’s LHV is about 85 percent of 
its HHV. Depending on whether HHV or LHV is used, 
efficiency values differ at various points in the chain 
(for example, electrolysis). The end-to-end efficiency 
of hydrogen is independent of the choice of metric. 
See Philipp Lettenmeier, Efficiency—electrolysis, 
Siemens Energy white paper, 2020; and Making 
the hydrogen economy possible: Accelerating 
clean hydrogen in an electrified economy, Energy 
Transitions Commission, March 2023.

602  All efficiency figures in this section are based  
on McKinsey Hydrogen Insights unless  
otherwise stated. 

603  Current SOECs require steam at a temperature of 

about 500°C to operate. If the heat used to generate 
this steam is waste heat from other processes, 
and its value is therefore excluded from the energy 
input, SOECs can deliver an efficiency of about 
100 percent. McKinsey Hydrogen Insights and Tony

607  In LHV terms, natural gas and hydrogen boilers are 

often described as having efficiency of more than 
90 percent, which corresponds to around 75 to 
80 percent HHV efficiency. See McKinsey Hydrogen 
Insights; H2 Science Coalition; and Oddgeir 
Gudmundsson and Jan Eric Thorsen, “Source-to-
sink efficiency of blue and green district heating 
and hydrogen-based heat supply systems,” Smart 
Energy, volume 6, May 2022. 

608  Additional losses of around 5 to 15 percent also 
occur in a hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicle;  
this relates to the inversion of alternate to direct 
current and the electric engine efficiency. See

on identifying the key contributors to affordable &

609  Energy efficiency is higher for fuel cells or combined-
cycle turbines, and lower for open-cycle turbines.

612  The end-to-end efficiency is the result of the 
multiplication of each step: 90 times 80 times 
50 percent equals 36 percent.

613  Efficiency figures are based on heat output at 

the point of its production (for instance, a boiler). 
Additional efficiencies in the delivery of that heat, 
such as in radiators in a home, are not considered.

650  Ibid. In this analysis, energy efficiency includes,  
for example, the following mitigation options: 
avoiding demand for energy services; efficient 
lighting, appliances, and equipment; fuel efficiency 
in light- and heavy-duty vehicles; efficiency and 
optimization in shipping; and energy efficiency in 
aviation and industry. 

651  Out of this increase, about 0.5 percentage point 
could come from improvements in efficiency from 
electrification and the use of renewables, which is 
broader than the scope of this challenge. However, 
the remaining 1.5 percentage points would come 
largely from technical-efficiency improvements, 
such as improved insulation in buildings, or avoided 
demand (for example, through behavioral changes 
such as higher use of public transportation or limited 
heating of buildings). See Net zero roadmap: A 
global pathway to keep the 1.5ºC goal in reach, IEA, 
September 2023.

652  This research examines 25 significant physical 

challenges associated with the transition. Twenty 
of these are explored in detail in the deep dives. 
These 20 were chosen to enable us to illustrate and 
understand the broad dynamics associated with 
the physical transformation of the energy system 
and draw overarching conclusions. Two of the three 
challenges described in this chapter are not explored 
in depth in this research: Challenge 23: Expanding 
energy efficiency, and Challenge 25: Capturing 
atmospheric carbon. 

653  CDR can be achieved using technology-based 

solutions, such as DAC, by combining bioenergy 
with CCUS to create net-negative emissions or 
using nature-based solutions, including mangrove 
restoration, afforestation and reforestation, and 
regenerative soil projects. Scaling nature-based 
solutions would require addressing barriers 
including, but not limited to, lowering the cost of 
projects, improved transparency of standards, 
practices, and services, and creating regulatory 
clarity. See Peter Mannion, Emma Parry, Mark Patel,

663  The Global CCS Institute looked at a range of 

scenarios. In those consistent with limiting global 
temperature rises to 1.5°C, total CO2 sequestered 
using CCUS is estimated to range from five 
gigatonnes of CO2 per year to 28 gigatonnes in  
2020. The average across scenarios is 11 gigatonnes. 
Under a 2°C pathway, the range is 0.4 gigatonnes 
of CO2 a year to 30 gigatonnes; the average is 
6.0 gigatonnes a year. See Scaling up the CCS 
market to deliver net-zero emissions, 2020 Thought 
Leadership, Global CCS Institute, 2020.

664  Emissions that arise from mobility and buildings are 

spread among a large number of individually small 
assets and can be described as diffuse emissions. 
Carbon capture usually isn’t thought to play a large 
role in abating these emissions.

670  Where the CO₂ is dilute, more equipment is required 
because the separation technology may rely on 
chemical rather than physical processes. See 
“Carbon capture” in Meeting the dual challenge: A 
roadmap to at-scale deployment of carbon capture, 
use, and storage, National Petroleum Council, 
December 2019 (updated March 2021). 

671  The reason is that lower concentrations also reduce 

the kinetics of capture processes.
