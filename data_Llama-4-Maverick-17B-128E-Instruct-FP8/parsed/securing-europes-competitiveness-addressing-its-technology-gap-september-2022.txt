The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the business and economics research arm of McKinsey, 
was established in 1990 to develop a deeper understanding of the evolving global economy. 
MGI's mission is to provide leaders in the commercial, public, and social sectors with the facts 
and insights on which to base management and policy decisions.

MGI research combines the disciplines of economics and management, employing the 
analytical tools of economics with the insights of business leaders. Our “micro-to-macro” 
methodology examines microeconomic industry trends to better understand the broad 
macroeconomic forces affecting business strategy and public policy. MGI’s in-depth reports 
have covered more than 20 countries and 30 industries. 

Current research focuses on seven themes: growth and competition; labor markets and 
work; financial markets and investment; consumers, behavior, and health; resources and 
sustainability; technology and innovation; and society and institutions. 

Recent reports have assessed the impact of the COVID 19 crisis on the future of work, 
productivity and growth, and consumer demand; prioritizing health; the social contract; 
Black economic mobility; the impact of AI; the Bio Revolution; physical climate risk; impact of 
corporations on economy and households; and global value chains.

MGI is led by McKinsey & Company senior partners Sven Smit, who serves as chair, and Chris 
Bradley, Kweilin Ellingrud, Marco Piccitto, Olivia White, and Jonathan Woetzel, who serve as 
directors. Michael Chui, Mekala Krishnan, Anu Madgavkar, Jan Mischke, Jeongmin Seong, 
and Tilman Tacke are MGI partners. Project teams are led by the MGI partners and include 
consultants from McKinsey offices around the world. These teams draw on McKinsey’s global 
network of partners and industry and management experts.

The MGI Council is made up of McKinsey leaders and includes Hemant Ahlawat, Michael 
Birshan, Andrés Cadena, Sandrine Devillard, André Dua, Katy George, Rajat Gupta, Eric 
Hazan, Solveigh Hieronimus, Acha Leke, Clarisse Magnin, Jurica Novak, Gary Pinkus, Hamid 
Samandari, Sha Sha, Oliver Tonby, and Eckart Windhagen. The Council members help 
shape the research agenda, lead high-impact research, and share the findings with decision 
makers around the world. In addition, leading economists, including Nobel laureates, advise 
MGI research. 

This report contributes to MGI’s mission to help business and policy leaders understand the 
forces transforming the global economy and prepare for the next wave of growth. As with all 
MGI research and reports, this work is independent and reflects our own views. This report

Preface 

In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, political and business leaders around 
the globe are keenly focused on defense, energy supply, food security, and supply chain 
disruptions. The crisis has raised concerns about resilience, self-reliance, and strategic 
autonomy. In this context, it would be all too easy to forget the vital and growing role of 
technology—the focus of this research—in competitiveness, growth, and—yes—resilience 
and strategic autonomy in Europe.

Notwithstanding urgent challenges, Europe has been experiencing a slow-motion but 
increasingly apparent crisis centered on the region’s technological capabilities and the 
competitiveness of its firms—one that requires attention if Europe is to boost growth, combat 
the specter of stagflation, finance investments in sustainability and inclusion, and maintain its 
strategic autonomy. Confronting Europe’s corporate and technology gaps with other major 
regions will require European leaders to show the same resolve and collaboration they have 
displayed in their response to the pandemic as well as to their initial response to the invasion 
of Ukraine. 

This report builds on an MGI article in May 2022, Securing Europe’s future beyond energy: 
Addressing its corporate and technology gap. Our diagnostic presents Europe’s erosion 
of corporate and technological competitiveness in depth, describes its root causes, and 
proposes actions that can turn a challenge into a high-stakes opportunity. The analysis is 
framed by the imperative of achieving sustainability, inclusion, and growth, and it gauges 
where Europe stands on all three dimensions. The research then focuses on the performance 
of European corporations, using McKinsey’s Corporate Performance Analytics (CPAnalytics) 
to examine a sample of more than 2,000 companies in Europe and the United States 
with revenue of more than $1 billion. MGI found that European companies, in aggregate, 
are significantly underperforming their US counterparts, and that technology—namely 
information and communications technology (ICT) and pharmaceuticals—is responsible 
for much of the difference. The research details corporate performance both at the sector 
level and for individual economies. We also look at ten transversal technologies that are 
permeating virtually every sector and gauge where Europe stands in each of them to 
ascertain its competitive position in the years ahead. Finally, the report discusses some areas 
where European decision makers in the public and private sectors could better leverage 
Europe’s scale and accelerate its response to disruption. 

The research was led by Sven Smit, a McKinsey senior partner in Amsterdam and chairman 
of MGI; Magnus Tyreman, managing partner for McKinsey in Europe in Stockholm; Matthias 
Evers, a former McKinsey senior partner in Hamburg; Eric Hazan, a McKinsey senior 
partner in Paris; Jurica Novak, a McKinsey senior partner in Warsaw; Solveigh Hieronimus, 
a McKinsey senior partner in Munich; Jan Mischke, an MGI partner in Zurich; and Philipp 
Ernst, a McKinsey senior expert in Hamburg. Sahil Tesfu (alumnus) and Louis-Charles 
Mosseray (alumnus) kicked off the research. The project team was led by Guillaume Dagorret, 
a McKinsey consultant in Paris, and Valentin Liebhart (alumnus), a McKinsey consultant in 
Berlin. The team comprised Lucie Bertholon, Louis Blanluet, Laura Bogaert, Mehdi Bouajila,

In brief

Addressing Europe’s corporate and technology gap

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine not only 
has been a humanitarian catastrophe 
but also has shone a harsh light on a 
range of strategic challenges, from 
defense to food and energy security, and 
made resilience an even higher priority. 
Technology is pivotal, too, for Europe’s 
strategic autonomy and resilience, as 
well as its growth and competitiveness. 
While the war in Ukraine and its impact 
are at the forefront of our minds, Europe 
also needs to address a slow-motion 
crisis centered on a corporate and 
technological gap that predated the 
invasion in February 2022. For the sake 
of long-term resilience and prosperity, 
the region needs to act decisively to 
develop and scale competitive firms and 
technologies more quickly. The following 
are the key findings: 

When Europe works, it works 
well. Europe has a strong record on 
sustainability and inclusion. Europe 
has 2.4 times lower CO₂ emissions per 
capita and 1.8 times lower CO₂ emissions 
per unit of GDP than the United States, 
and emissions are declining 30 and 
50 percent faster than in China and the 
United States, respectively. Income 
inequality as measured by the Gini index is 
30, compared with 41 in the United States 
and 39 in China. All top ten countries in 
the Social Mobility Index published by the 
World Economic Forum are European. 
Starting from the bottom quintile, it takes 
two to three generations in Scandinavia to 
attain mean income; in the United States, 
it takes five generations. Europe tracked 
other advanced economies’ sluggish 
growth in per capita GDP between 2000 
and 2019, but Europe’s per capita GDP 
is about 30 percent lower than that of 
the United States, mostly because of 
labor market choices and the fact that 
economies in Central and Eastern Europe 
have not yet caught up with their Western 
European counterparts. 

Europe’s corporations on average 
lag behind their international peers 
on metrics of profitability, growth, 
and innovation. Europe has many 

vi

high-performing companies, but, in 
aggregate, between 2014 and 2019, 
large European companies (with more 
than $1 billion in revenue) had three 
percentage points lower return on 
invested capital, grew 40 percent 
more slowly, and spent 40 percent 
less on R&D—all in comparison with 
US counterparts sampled. ICT and 
pharmaceuticals account for 60 percent 
of the growth gap and 75 percent of the 
R&D gap.

As technology permeates all sectors, 
Europe is falling behind on eight of 
ten transversal technologies. Ten 
transversal technologies are permeating 
virtually all industries. Seven link to 
digitization with strong winner-take-
most dynamics and network effects, 
putting Europe at a disadvantage. For 
instance, the top ten major companies 
investing in quantum computing are in 
the United States or China, not in Europe. 
In artificial intelligence (AI), investment 
by US corporations is six times that of 
their European counterparts. In 5G, 
Europe has strong suppliers but lags 
behind on deployment. In cleantech, 
a European stronghold, the region 
remains ahead on patents, venture 
capital funding, and world-class installed 
capacity in mature technologies. But 
even there, China intervened to take the 
lead in cleantech production in nearly 
all areas, and the United States leads 
on most breakthrough technologies 
including nuclear fusion. Technological 
disruption challenges Europe’s 
stronghold industries. For instance, 
US manufacturers account for close to 
70 percent of all kilometers traveled by L4 
fully-autonomous vehicles.

The stakes are high. We estimate that 
corporate value added of €2 trillion 
to €4 trillion a year could be at stake 
by 2040. This is equivalent to one 
percentage point of growth a year; six 
times the amount needed in Europe to 
achieve net-zero emissions by 2050; or 
about 90 percent of all current European 
social expenditure. Moreover, in a shifting 

geopolitical environment that appears 
increasingly polarized, Europe’s strategic 
autonomy and voice in the world could be 
at risk. 

In a winner-takes-most world, 
European decision makers and 
companies need to be proactive in 
favor of speed and scale. For its firms 
to compete, Europe needs to level the 
playing field and play at greater scale 
and speed. Eleven initiatives could help 
turn the tide. For instance, moving to 
joint procurement in innovation-related 
areas, from defense to healthcare, could 
promote cross-border competition 
and scale; today Europe pools only 
0.2 percent of its total public procurement 
at the European level, compared with 
45 percent at the US federal level. 
Further, could Europe create a common 
28th regime for regulating high-growth 
firms as they scale? Could it consider 
developing fast-track regulatory approval 
and decision-making processes, as 
happened in the case of COVID-19 
vaccine approval? Whether or not the 
competitive arena improves, corporate 
leaders and owners need to take more 
risks and raise competitiveness by, for 
instance, setting stretch long-term 
targets, adjusting incentives, and 
leveraging programmatic M&A and 
alliances to build scale and capabilities. 

There are reasons to be optimistic. 
Europe has many strengths, including 
high-quality education systems and 
one of the most open and connected 
economies in the world. In 2021, Europe 
experienced the largest increase in 
unicorns since 2014 and attracted a 
record $110 billion of venture capital 
funding, exceeding China’s tally. And the 
European Union has launched a number 
of initiatives aimed at addressing the 
technology gap, including the Digital 
Markets Act, Horizon Europe, and 
the Important Projects of Common 
European Interest.

1. When Europe works, 

it works well

Continuing to better the lives of all Europeans over the long haul requires sustainability, 
inclusion, and growth. The three reinforce—or can undermine—one another; it is not a 
question of or, but and.1 Growth is needed to achieve prosperity and well-being, and to pay 
for the transitions required to make Europe’s economies more sustainable and inclusive. 
Not only is sustainability critical for our planet, but without it, there can be no long-term 
prosperity. Inclusivity is a goal in its own right and is needed to strengthen aggregate demand 
and propel growth as well as to secure sufficiently broad support to sustain necessary 
sustainability investments.2 

Where does Europe stand on sustainable and inclusive growth? The region is further 
ahead than others in the battle against climate change—although progress, as elsewhere, 
is not rapid or extensive enough to secure net-zero emissions by 2050. Europe also leads 
on equality, social progress, and life satisfaction—aspects of inclusiveness—albeit with 
significant variations within regions. When Europe works, it works well (Exhibit 1).

Sustainability: Europe is a world leader on holding down the level of 
carbon emissions and the pace of reducing them

Europe remains one of the largest emitters of carbon globally, with 6.4 metric tons of CO2 per 
capita on average, but this is less than China’s 7.3 metric tons and well below 16.0 metric tons 
in the United States.3 Emissions have also been declining at a rate between 30 and 50 percent 
faster than in the United States and China. Europe has been a front-runner globally on action 
to mitigate climate change, putting in place targets for the reduction of pollution in the early 
2000s. It has pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions before other regions 
(Exhibit 2).4 European countries are global leaders on the use of renewable energy. Between 
2000 and 2018, the region increased its share of renewable energy by between 3.7 percent 
and 5.3 percent per annum, depending on the economy. In the same period, the United 
States increased its share by 3.1 percent a year, while China reduced its share by 4.1 percent 
per annum.5 

30–50%

faster decline in carbon 
emissions in Europe than in 
the United States and China

and growing,” McKinsey & Company, October 26, 2021. Countries that have experienced faster growth over the past 
four decades had lower market inequality in the 2010s. See Philippe Aghion, Reda Cherif, and Fuad Hasanov, “Fair and

2  Unless specified otherwise, in our analysis, Europe comprises the 27 member states of the European Union (EU) plus 

Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We group these economies as Europe 30. This report discusses them as 
a region. However, we acknowledge that this group includes independent countries, often with very different economic 
profiles. Moreover, these countries have a number of neighbors to the east, including Ukraine, that are part of the 
European continent and may in the future forge closer economic ties with the group of 30 countries analyzed in this 
research. In the final section, on potential actions that Europe can take, many of the measures described would need to 
happen at the level of the EU, ideally in collaboration and coordination with the other nations in the geographic region.
3  Continental Europe includes Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Switzerland. Northern 
Europe comprises Denmark, Finland, Ireland (the Republic of), Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Southern 
Europe comprises Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain. Eastern Europe comprises Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Poland, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia.

on most dimensions 

Europe leads on most dimensions of inclusion and social progress. However, there is 
significant divergence on these measures within the region with high rankings generally due 
to a strong showing by countries in Northern and Continental Europe. 

Income inequality as measured by the Gini index is only 30.6 The figure in the United States 
is 41, and in China, 39.7 The Europe 30’s gap between the top 10 percent in household 
disposable income and the bottom 10 percent was 67 percent smaller than the equivalent gap 
in the United States in 2019.8 Europe is also well placed on elements of inclusiveness such 
as gender equality. In 2019, 28 of the Europe 30 had an average score of about 10 percent 
on the Gender Inequality Index published by the United Nations Development Programme, 
compared with 20 percent for the United States.9 All the countries ranked in the top ten of the 
2020 World Economic Forum’s Social Mobility Index are European.10 Europe overall has the 
highest life expectancy in the world: the EU-27 average in 2019 was 81 years, versus 79 in the 
United States and 77 in China.11 

We used the Social Progress Index to gauge Europe’s performance on well-being.12 According 
to the index, the highest-ranked countries in 2020 were in Continental and Northern Europe. 
Norway, Denmark, and Finland took the first three places, and Sweden and Switzerland 
ranked fifth and sixth (after New Zealand). The average score for the five top-ranked 
European countries on the index was 92 (the figure for the five largest European countries by 
population was similar at 89). The United States scored 86 and China 66.13 On social progress 
overall, Europe and China are continuing to make headway, while the United States is holding 
its position or declining. 

Looking in more detail at the elements that contribute to well-being, a combination of a sense 
of personal safety, health, and the quality of the environment accounts for the leading position 
of so many European countries (Exhibit 3). Looking more closely at health, Europe has the 
highest life expectancy, five to six years on average higher than in the other major regions we 
considered. However, Eastern Europe’s average life expectancy is six years lower than the 
European average and three years lower than the US average, and on a par with China in 2019. 
Eastern Europe is also improving life expectancy more slowly than either Europe as a whole or 
China and the United States. Taking the top ten countries globally for nutrition and basic care, 
all ten are European. The United States ranks 29th and China 46th. Europe is continuing to 
improve on health, the United States is stable, and China is catching up quickly. 

9 of 
top 10

countries for life satisfaction 
were European in 2020

Northern and Continental European countries top life satisfaction rankings and score higher 
on average than the United States (Exhibit 4).14 In 2020, nine of the top ten countries for 
life satisfaction were European. However, when including all European countries, Europe’s 
ranking is lower than that of the United States. On the World Happiness Index, Europe 
scores 6.4, the United States 6.9, and China 5.1. The World Happiness Report also ranks life 
satisfaction by city, and on this measure Europe and the United States are closer; 37 percent 
of cities ranked in the global top 30 are in Europe, and 30 percent in the United States.

Several European economies lead on social mobility. Looking at the number of generations it 
takes for those born in low-income families to approach the level of the mean income in their 
country, we find that in the United States it is five generations, but only, for instance, two or 
three in Scandinavia and four in some Continental European countries (Exhibit 5).

and prosperity

Looking back over a longer period, between 1970 and 2010, Europe’s GDP growth was more 
dynamic than that of the United States on a per capita basis. Europe’s per capita GDP grew 
at 2.3 percent versus 1.9 percent in the United States, partially because of catch-up effects. 
Driven by faster population growth, in total GDP terms the US economy grew faster than the 
Europe 30 economy in aggregate.15 Between 1970 and 2010, Europe’s total GDP grew by 
2.6 percent versus 2.9 percent in the United States. While GDP per capita matters for living 
standards, total GDP matters for market scale and firm growth opportunities. 

One notable contributing factor was the convergence of the economies of Central and 
Eastern Europe once they joined the European Union (EU) in 2004 in the biggest single 
enlargement of the bloc. Eastern European economies started closing the gap with their 
western counterparts both in the run-up to 2004 and subsequently.16 The pace, extent, and 
timing of this convergence varied among these economies. Another contributory factor 
has been the impact of the Single Market, which is estimated to have added 9 percent to 
long-term European GDP. In short, its collective scale was working in Europe’s favor over 
this period.17 

However, between 2010 and 2020, European GDP growth lost steam, falling to 0.8 percent, 
compared with 1.7 percent in the United States, in the aftermath of the euro crisis in 2010 
(Exhibit 6).18 The United States ran a more expansionary macroeconomic policy than Europe 
and was more aggressive in bailing out banks—notably, bank bailouts in Europe were handled 
at the national rather than regional level. 

Additionally, Europe’s per capita GDP (in purchasing power parity terms and constant 2017 
international dollars) was $45,100 in 2019, 30 percent lower than $63,900, the figure for the 
United States.

Most US states have higher per capita GDP than most European countries (Exhibit 7). 
Moreover, only the bottom decile earns higher income, on average, than in the United States.19

Not all of Europe’s persistent per capita GDP gap with the United States translates into lower 
welfare for European citizens. Forty percent of the gap is based on settled—and widely 
supported—societal and lifestyle choices in Europe. They include opting for earlier retirement 
ages and more vacation and parental leave in Europe. There is a great deal of heterogeneity 
in the provision of public goods within Europe, which is not accounted for in GDP, but, overall, 
these choices account for 40 percent of the gap. An additional 30 percent is driven by 
persistently large divides between different regions of Europe, even if those are diminishing 
(Exhibit 8).20

on sustainability and inclusion, and some aspects of growth

Europe’s strong showing on sustainability, inclusion, and aspects of growth reflects what the 
region can achieve when it collaborates most effectively, playing to its strengths and scale. 

 — On sustainability, the European Green Deal strategy and the Fit for 55 package both 
included major funds that will contribute to Europe’s response to the climate crisis 
and support its aim to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.21 The 
€72 billion Social Climate Fund, for instance, will provide support and investments 
to vulnerable households and entrepreneurs affected by the climate action plans of 
member states. In addition, the EU’s research and innovation program for 2021 to 2027—
Horizon Europe—will allocate about 35 percent of its €95 billion budget to innovation 
supporting sustainability.22 

 — On inclusion, European direct investment and labor mobility have contributed to rapid 
growth in its less prosperous regions. Membership in the EU has enabled just short of 
22 million people in Eastern Europe to leave poverty.23 

 — On growth, Europe has created world-competitive companies in sectors from steel 
to aerospace on the back of one of the largest markets in the world. Airbus is one 
example. Amadeus is another; the global airline reservations system, formed in 1987 in a 
collaboration among Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa, and SAS, is becoming one of Europe’s 
largest and most valuable software companies. More recently, European institutional

top 20 on PISA scores

innovations such as the European Stability Mechanism created in 2012, the SURE 
program, and the NextGen EU (including the Resilience and Recovery Fund) have helped 
absorb some of the largest economic shocks in a century.

Europe has many fundamental strengths, including high-quality education systems, 
openness to trade, and relatively lower national debt. Eleven European countries rank in 
the top 20 in Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores compiled by 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Europe is home to 
43 percent of the world’s top 100 universities for life sciences, according to The Times Higher 
Education World University Rankings 2021, compared with 34 percent in the United States. 
In the case of trade, Europe is more open than the United States, although this traditional 
strength may also turn into a vulnerability in a changing geopolitical environment. For the 
Europe 30, exports accounted for 10.9 percent of GDP. In the United States, the share was 
6.8 percent. Note that these are apples-to-apples comparisons that strip out intraregional 
trade.24 Europe has the most sophisticated industrial supply chains.25 Finally, it has a lower 
level of public and private debt as a share of GDP than the United States; for 2020, the figure 
was 218 percent of GDP in aggregate, compared with 326 percent in the United States.26 

In aggregate, Europe is a leader on sustainability and inclusion, and tracks other regions 
on growth. But Europe’s future growth trajectory could be in doubt because of an 
underwhelming performance by its companies in comparison with those in the United States. 
In the next chapter, we look at corporate performance and its root causes, finding that today’s 
gaps are largely due to lagging technology in Europe.

2. Europe’s tech-driven 

corporate gap

$2t– 
$4t

of corporate value added 
could be at stake annually 
by 2040

Europe has many high-performing companies, but in aggregate, its firms are growing more 
slowly, creating lower returns, and investing less in R&D than their US counterparts. This 
largely reflects long-standing weakness on ICT and other forms of disruptive innovation. As 
technology and disruption continue to spread across sectors and exert deepening influence 
on competitiveness, Europe is vulnerable almost everywhere. 

Corporate Europe’s technology gap has long been considered a result of specialization and 
competitive advantage, with the justification that Europe is strong on other sectors such as 
industry, chemicals, materials, and fashion, for instance, and therefore the disparity is not 
something to worry about. This is no longer true. Technology is now permeating all sectors via 
transversal technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud. If 
Europe is not successful in competing in these technologies, it could lose all its strongholds 
in traditional industries. To give just one example, Europe has been a leader in automotive but 
could become a laggard in autonomous driving. 

Corporate value added of €2 trillion to €4 trillion a year could be at stake by 2040. To put 
this into perspective, that would be equivalent to about half of total forecast European GDP 
growth to 2040, six times the amount needed to transition to net zero by 2050, and about 
90 percent of all current European social expenditure. 

Unless Europe confronts its corporate and technology gap, its strong performance on 
sustainability and inclusion could become more difficult to maintain. Although some 
Europeans argue that lower growth is needed to achieve net zero, growth strengthens 
confidence and creates a healthy investment climate and new income streams that are 
needed to pay for the energy transition. Lagging growth could, moreover, undermine inclusion 
by limiting the pool of funds available to spend on social programs.27 Finally, it could also 
compromise Europe’s strategic autonomy in economics and geopolitics in an increasingly 
polarized world.28 While strategic autonomy is fully compatible with strong global trade and 
collaboration, it does require multiple supplier options as well as leading capabilities in some 
areas as a strong bargaining chip.

Europe’s clear and well-known weakness in tech is a primary source of 
a large and growing corporate performance challenge

Data show that Europe’s corporate performance is underwhelming in aggregate. To 
understand this phenomenon, we used McKinsey’s Corporate Performance Analytics 
(CPAnalytics) to examine a sample of about 2,200 companies around the world with revenue 
of more than $1 billion (see Box 1, “Corporate analysis”). Between 2014 and 2019, large 
European companies with more than $1 billion in revenue were 20 percent less profitable 
(measured by return on invested capital) than their US counterparts, grew revenue about 
40 percent more slowly, invested 8 percent less (capital expenditures relative to the stock of 
invested capital), and spent about 40 percent less on R&D (Exhibit 9).29 

27  Benjamin M. Friedman, The moral consequences of economic growth, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2010.
28  The EU defines strategic autonomy in a way that is different from the concept of sovereignty. Rooted initially in defense 

and security, it has, over time, broadened to include economics and technology. The broad concept is that Europe should 
not do everything within Europe but should never rely on a single source. See Why European strategic autonomy matters, 
European External Action Service, December 3, 2020.

29  MGI research has found that in OECD economies, the business sector has provided 72 percent of GDP; that contribution 

has tripled in per capita GDP terms since the 1960s. See A new look at how corporations impact the economy and 
households, McKinsey Global Institute, May 2021.

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gapBox 1

Corporate analysis

McKinsey & Company’s CPAnalytics 
database has about 12,000 
companies worldwide with revenue 
of more than $1 billion. For this 
analysis, we took 7,428 companies 
with headquarters in Europe and the 
United States and filtered out around 
5,000 companies for data and scope 
reasons. This left us a sample of 2,222 
companies for which we undertook 
detailed analysis. Specifically, 
we excluded: 

 — 4,381 companies that do not 

report invested capital

 — 767 subsidiary companies as well 
as financial companies for which 
return on invested capital (ROIC) 
is not an appropriate metric 

 — 301 private and state-owned 

companies, as many had a mostly 
public service provision rather 
than a profit and growth objective; 

examples include public railway 
companies and hospitals.

We then added back 243 separately 
listed subsidiary, private, or state-
owned companies following a 
company-by-company check that 
subsidiaries are separately listed and 
not consolidated with their parent 
companies, or state-owned firms that 
have a commercial remit. 

In terms of sample mix by geography 
of the CPAnalytics sample, the United 
States represents 55 percent of 
number of companies and 58 percent 
of revenue in 2014–19 while European 
countries represent, respectively, 
45 and 42 percent. The three largest 
European countries—Germany, 
the United Kingdom, and France—
represent, respectively, 44 percent in 
terms of numbers of companies, and 
55 percent in terms of revenue.

R&D intensity analysis was calculated 
from the 2020 EU Industrial R&D 
Investment Scoreboard (2019 figures) 
with the world’s top 25,000 R&D 
spenders, excluding financial and real 
estate companies.

Looking at the sample mix by 
geography of the 2020 EU industrial 
R&D scoreboard, the United States 
represents 54 percent of number of 
companies, 43 percent of revenue, 
and 58 percent of R&D spending, all 
in 2019, while European countries 
represent 46, 57, and 42 percent, 
respectively. The three largest 
European countries—Germany, 
the United Kingdom, and France—
represent more than half of Europe’s 
sample, with 51, 61, and 64 percent of 
Europe’s total, respectively.

A (possibly substantial) portion of this may reflect rising concentration and superstar 
dynamics in US firms, as well as their higher share of investment in intangible assets.30 In 2019, 
intangibles such as innovation, brands, and human, digital, and analytical capital accounted 
for 42 percent of US investment; in ten European economies, the share was 36 percent. 

Nevertheless, the numbers are startling.31 Most of the differences are observable in 
technology-creating industries, specifically tech, ICT (including large technology firms), and 
pharmaceuticals. Together, these sectors account for more than 90 percent of the return 
on invested capital (ROIC) gap, over 80 percent of the gap on capital expenditure relative 
to the stock of invested capital, more than 60 percent of the revenue growth gap, and over 
70 percent of the R&D intensity gap (Exhibit 10). While the difference in ROIC is a double-
edged sword, and there is a legitimate argument that high ROIC reflects entrenched market 
positions and pricing power, the growth and R&D gaps are clearly not sustainable for Europe. 

The ICT difference is also seen in the enterprise value (debt plus equity) of large, listed firms. 
The value of large European firms was on a par with that of US-based firms in 2000 ($7 trillion 
versus $8 trillion). However, by November 2021, those in the United States were worth more 
than double their European counterparts ($46 trillion versus $21 trillion). The six largest 
US technology firms contributed almost half to that value difference (Exhibit 11). We note 
that geopolitical turbulence in the first half of 2022, a period in which stock markets were 
highly volatile, had a greater impact on US growth stocks than on European ones; the market 
valuation gap between US and European corporations narrowed but did not close. 

30  MGI defines a superstar as a firm, sector, or city that has a substantially greater share of income than peers and is 

pulling away from those peers over time. For firms, our metric is economic profit, a measure of a firm’s invested capital 
multiplied by its return above the cost of capital. We focus on economic profit rather than revenue size, market share, or 
productivity growth because these other metrics have a risk of including firms that are simply large and might not create 
economic value. MGI’s research finds that superstar firms’ earnings represent 13 to 15 percent of the entire global pool of 
economic surplus and 22 to 25 percent of all corporate earnings worldwide. See Thomas Philippon, The Great Reversal: 
How America gave up on free markets, Belknap Press, 2019; and Superstars: The dynamics of firms, sectors, and cities 
leading the global economy, McKinsey Global Institute, October 2018.

McKinsey Global InstituteRecent signs indicate that Europe’s tech industries have picked up. According to Atomico, 
in 2021 Europe experienced the largest increase in unicorns (startups valued at more than 
$1 billion) since 2014, with 98 new unicorns.32 In 2021, Europe attracted a record $110 billion 
of venture capital funding, exceeding other markets. Nevertheless, Europe’s capital 
investment is still nearly three times lower than that of the United States, and the uptick in 
capital investment has not yet translated into companies with sufficiently large scale to move 
the needle on aggregate corporate performance. A March 2022 note from Morgan Stanley 
highlighted Europe’s rising share of small-scale funding rounds of up to $10 million, an early 
sign of generating future leading companies, and noted that talent spinning out of Europe’s 
unicorns is increasingly staying in Europe rather than going to the United States or Asia. 
Morgan Stanley said that US skeptics have started to warm to Europe. In the past three years, 
typically US-focused venture capital funds have begun to participate more in Europe deals.33

The relative performance of European companies against their US counterparts varies. 
We looked at the same four metrics of corporate performance: ROIC, revenue growth, 
capital expenditure relative to stock of invested capital, and R&D intensity (Exhibit 12). As 
may be expected, Europe has a strong record, particularly on automotive and industrials, 
and a pronounced gap in ICT and, increasingly due to the higher weight of biotech, in 
pharmaceuticals. The picture is more nuanced in other sectors. For instance, in aerospace 
and defense, large European firms tend to be smaller and less profitable, but they have 
been growing more strongly and invested a higher share of revenue in R&D than their 
US competitors; while this could be a good sign, it is as much a reflection of national 
fragmentation and a lack of European scale. In materials, European firms tend to be larger and 
growing more quickly, but they invest a lower share of their revenue in R&D.

of new value created globally 
will be digitally enabled, 
according to the World 
Economic Forum

As technology permeates sectors and scale advantages and winner-
takes-most dynamics rise, Europe’s approach may not be sustainable

Technology used to be a sector; now it is everywhere. It has spawned a range of transversal 
technologies relevant to all sectors, such as AI, quantum computing, and cloud; the core of 
competitive dynamics is now horizontal rather than vertical. Value creation is shifting to these 
horizontal areas with strong corporate winner-takes-most dynamics and network effects. 
The World Economic Forum estimates that 70 percent of the new value created in the whole 
economy over the next ten years will be digitally enabled, and the COVID-19 pandemic only 
accelerated this momentum.34 In July 2020, executives surveyed by McKinsey estimated that 
they had accelerated adoption of digitization, in the case of supply chains by 35 percent.35 

Digitization and the spread of a broad range of transformational technologies is, if anything, 
speeding up, and the potential penalty for lagging on innovation and key technologies is 
rising. In 2019, MGI analyzed nearly 6,000 of the world’s largest public and private companies 
with revenue of more than $1 billion—so-called superstars—and found that the top 10 percent 
of firms capture 80 percent of positive economic profit. The middle 60 percent of companies 
record near-zero economic profit on average, showing how hard it can be to defy market 
forces. The bottom 10 percent destroy as much value as superstars create. The gap between 
leaders and laggards is widening, suggesting that winner-takes-most dynamics are playing 
out. After adjusting for inflation, superstar companies have 1.6 times more economic profit, on 
average, than superstars 20 years earlier, and bottom-decile companies on average have 1.5 
times more economic loss.36 

Where economies and companies stand on key technologies is therefore pivotal. But what are 
the technologies that matter? McKinsey researched a wide range of tech trends and homed in 
on the ten that are most relevant.37 We look at ten transversal technologies on which Europe’s 
future performance and prosperity hinge (Exhibit 13). We compared Europe’s relative position 
to that of the leader or second-best region on the innovation, production, and adoption stages 
for the ten transversal technologies. For each metric in each of these three stages, we first 
calculated the size ratio of Europe against the leader or second-best region; for instance, in 
the case of number of patents, which is one metric in the innovation stage, if Europe issued 
18 percent of world-class patents versus 56 percent in the United States, the ratio is 0.3 
(Exhibit 14).38 The factor of each stage is the average of the ratios of respective metrics. Finally, 
we estimate that from a ratio of 0.1 to 0.7, Europe is considered lagging behind; from 0.8 to 1.2, 
Europe is on a par; and from 1.3 up, Europe is leading. 

Europe leads on only two of the ten (Exhibit 15). For some illustrative examples, see Exhibit 16.

37  For every trend, McKinsey calculated a momentum score based on the growth rate of the technologies underlying the 
trends, which we derived from an in-depth analysis of six proxy metrics: patent filings, publications, news mentions, 
online search trends, amount of private investment, and the number of companies making investments. Scores for the 
underlying technologies were then rolled into a single composite score for the trend itself. See The top trends in tech,

the technology, and the number of citations of the patents in other patent applications; the country is identified by the

sectors, including strongholds like automotive and luxury goods 

Europe is being eclipsed on industrial-scale adoption of technology. Take automotive as an 
example. There are still two European automotive companies in the world’s top three auto 
manufacturers. As of 2018, five of the top ten premium cars sold in the United States were 
European. However, as of 2021, only three of the top ten electric vehicles sold in the United 
States were European.39 Additionally, US manufacturers account for close to 70 percent of 
all kilometers traveled by L4 full-autonomous vehicles, mostly because of Europe’s lag in AI, 
late regulation, and lack of funding. Similarly, European companies account for 95 percent of 
the value of luxury brands globally, but Europe is lagging on wearable devices; Apple, Huawei, 
Samsung, and Xiaomi have a combined market share of almost 65 percent. Europe has some 
of the most productive retailers but has no online retail platform to match the size of leading 
US and Chinese online retailers. Europe has strength in software, too, but is not leveraging 
its position to establish a world-leading business-to-business software company such as

its performance even in traditional sectors where it has led the world. 

Markets have already internalized this shift. Taking market capitalization shifts as an 
imperfect proxy for investor expectations of leadership (such shifts are essentially a bet on 
future profitability and reflect increased productivity and other factors such as market power), 
European firms improved their ranking on only three of 20-plus sectors from 2000 to 2019: 
household and personal products, pharmaceuticals, and retail (Exhibit 17).

Europe’s large companies lack scale and strategic control in comparison with their US 
counterparts. US companies have almost double the market-to-book ratios of their European 
counterparts, and nearly 30 percent higher levels of book equity (Exhibit 18).

sustainability, inclusion, and Europe’s strategic autonomy 

At stake is not only the performance of Europe’s companies, its tech prowess, and its 
economic growth and prosperity, but also its progress thus far on sustainability and inclusion. 
There are arguments that lower growth is needed to achieve net zero, but growth, properly 
measured, creates new income streams that are needed to pay for the energy transition and 
for inclusion measures, preventing zero-sum dynamics.41

Growth strengthens confidence and creates a healthy investment climate and new income 
streams that are needed to pay for the energy transition. Lagging growth could, moreover, 
undermine inclusion by limiting the pool of funds available to spend on social programs.

Our analysis suggests that if Europe fails to improve on transversal technologies, European 
firms could miss out on a value-added opportunity of €2 trillion to €4 trillion a year by 2040. 
Two approaches independently lead to this result (see Box 2, “Value at stake—methodology”). 

Value at stake of €2 trillion to €4 trillion equates to 30 to 70 percent of Europe’s forecast GDP 
growth between 2019 and 2040, or one percentage point of growth a year.42 To put this into 
further context, the lost value would be equivalent to six times the annual amount needed 
to transition to net zero.43 And it would amount to about 90 percent of all current social 
expenditure in Europe (Exhibit 19).44

Value at stake—methodology

Three approaches independently 
lead to the estimated value at stake 
(Exhibit 20). 

 — First, we looked at the market 

valuations of the top 5,000 global 
companies and translated this 
into revenue growth expectations, 
assuming constant ROIC. This 
analysis generated a figure of 
€3 trillion to €4 trillion less revenue 
a year for European companies 
than for US companies by 2040, 
or €1 trillion to €2 trillion lower 
corporate value added. 

 — Second, we used a bottom-up 
analysis of the ten transversal 
technologies’ forecast market sizes 
and their equivalent in gross value 
added (estimated at 40 percent). 
The total forecast market size sums 
up to €11 trillion to €20 trillion by 

1 

Forecast data for 2020–40 from IHS Markit.

2040. Given Europe’s current share 
of global GDP (23 percent), this 
equates to €2 trillion to €5 trillion at 
stake. Then, its gross value-added 
equivalent (estimated at 40 percent 
of revenues) equals €4 trillion to 
€8 trillion. Again, given Europe’s 
current share of global GDP, this 
equates to €1 trillion to €2 trillion at 
stake for the region.

 — Finally, we used a bottom-up 

analysis of the economic impact of 
the adoption of the ten transversal 
technologies. There could be 
€16 trillion to €30 trillion of value at 
stake and, given Europe’s current 
share, this equates to €4 trillion to 
€7 trillion at stake. 

We estimated the lower bound of the 
share of gross value added of revenue 
at 0.4 for Europe, assuming that the 

remaining value added will be captured 
outside Europe.

We have not modeled the complex 
relationship between corporate value-
added growth and economic growth. 
This would require understanding, 
for instance, the value generated 
in Europe by foreign subsidiaries, 
maintaining jobs and income in Europe; 
the alternative activities European 
firms and workers would pursue; the 
split of large corporate versus smaller 
firm value added; and second-order 
effects, nonlinear effects, or feedback 
loops that would be inherent to a 
general equilibrium modeling. As an 
illustration, if we assume that only 
profits shift abroad, the gross value 
added at stake would lie in the range 
of €1 trillion to €2 trillion (assuming 
a weighted average of 43 percent of 
gross operating surplus).1

for strategic autonomy on critical technologies. Such autonomy is compatible with open 
economies and global collaboration: it can be achieved via multiple independent and various 
global sourcing options as well as a strong footprint of globally leading firms in Europe. But 
it will also require capability buildup by, and scaling of, European firms. Today, for instance, 
only 9 percent of semiconductors to meet European demand are produced in Europe, and 
European companies have only about 10 percent of the market across the semiconductor 
value chain. In infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Europe has no player with a market share of 
more than 1 percent. 

Lagging tech-creating industries are the main reason for Europe’s corporate gap. This leaves 
the region vulnerable competitively in ten transversal technologies that are increasingly 
influencing the dynamics of virtually every sector. In Chapter 3, we look at the performance of 
individual European countries on sustainable and inclusive growth.

environment that is

autonomy on critical 
technologies.

of France’s electricity can be 
generated with low carbon 
emissions due to nuclear

O ver the past decade, France has emerged as a world leader on promoting 

sustainability (Exhibit 21). France’s per capita CO2 emissions are much lower than 
the Europe 30 average and the US level, and on a par with those of China. A major 
contributor to this strong showing is France’s extensive nuclear capacity, which ensures that 
about 70 percent of its electricity can be generated with low carbon emissions. France is 
the second-largest producer of nuclear energy in the world, with 56 operating reactors and 
capacity of more than 61,000 megawatts in 2021. France is performing above the Europe 30 
average on inclusion. France has higher social mobility, life expectancy, and social progress 
readings than the Europe 30 average, the United States, and China. On growth and prosperity, 
however, France lags behind. Although its per capita GDP was on a par with the Europe 30 
average in 2019, growth in per capita GDP between 2000 and 2019 was behind not only the 
Europe 30 average but also per capita GDP growth in China and the United States. 

France’s large companies outperform the economy but lag behind US counterparts on key 
metrics of corporate performance (Exhibit 22). Although they are only slightly behind their US 
counterparts—and match the Europe 30 average—on capital expenditure relative to invested 
capital stock, they lag significantly on return on invested capital and R&D intensity. Revenue 
growth is higher than the Europe 30 average, but it lags behind that of US large corporations 
by about 9 percent.

G ermany performs well on inclusion and on growth and prosperity, but less well on 

sustainability, where it lags behind the Europe 30 average (Exhibit 23). Germany’s 
per capita (consumption-based) CO2 emissions are significantly higher than those of 
China or the average of the Europe 30. The picture looks better relative to GDP. Germany has 
one of the strongest build-outs of renewables in Europe, having nearly doubled the installed 
capacity of renewables between 2011 and 2020.45 However, the country’s decision to end its 
use of nuclear power and its continued reliance on coal for power generation means that the 
country’s emissions reduction targets are at risk.46 On inclusion, Germany ranks relatively high 
on most metrics. Income inequality is on a par with the Europe 30 average, but social mobility 
is higher than the average. Life satisfaction is considerably higher than the Europe 30 average 
or in China or the United States. On growth and prosperity, Germany’s per capita GDP in 2019 
was just shy of that of the United States, and markedly higher than the Europe 30 average. 
Interestingly, however, growth in per capita GDP between 2000 and 2019 was lower than the 
Europe 30 average and China, albeit on a par with the United States. 

Turning to companies, capital expenditure relative to invested capital stock is on a par with 
the Europe 30 average and not far behind that of US counterparts (Exhibit 24). Germany is 
one of the highest spenders on R&D in the Europe 30, boosted by the vast R&D budgets of its 
automotive firms—although the rate of spending in 2019 relative to revenue was 30 percent 
below that of the United States. However, this above-average commitment to R&D has not 
been translating into higher return on invested capital and revenue growth, which lag behind 
that of large US companies by 23 percent and 54 percent, respectively.

I taly performs well on sustainability (Exhibit 25).47 Its per capita emissions and emissions 

as a share of GDP are lower than the Europe 30 average, although its consumption of 
fossil fuels is significantly higher than the Europe 30 average—indeed, at US levels. But 

Italy does not have as strong a record on inclusion, growth, and prosperity. On inclusion, it 
is notable, for instance, that Italy matches but does not surpass China on social mobility. Its 
per capita GDP is below the Europe 30 average and has decreased from its 2000 level in 
constant international 2017 dollars. Private debt is relatively low, but public debt is high. Italy 
matches the Europe 30 average for inward foreign direct investment and has a much lower 
current account deficit than the average of its neighbors. 

Corporate Italy is near the Europe 30 average and not far from US performance on capital 
expenditure relative to invested capital stock, but it lags significantly behind the Europe 30 
average and the performance of US counterparts on return on invested capital, revenue 
growth, and R&D intensity (Exhibit 26). It is notable that Italy’s R&D spending relative to 
revenue in 2019 was nearly 75 percent lower than that of the United States, and less than half 
of the Europe 30 average.

per capita GDP in 2019 for 
the Netherlands vs $45,300 
Europe 30 average

T he Netherlands’ per capita CO2 emissions (consumption based) and CO2 emissions 

per dollar of GDP (production based) are both higher than the Europe 30 average 
but much lower than the figures for the United States (Exhibit 27). Its fossil fuel 

consumption was 92 percent of primary energy in 2019, compared with the 74 percent 
average of the Europe 30—and much higher than for either China or the United States. In that 
year, 47 percent of primary energy generation came from oil, 38 percent from gas, and less 
than 8 percent from coal. The Netherlands’ performance on inclusion is strong. Compared 
with China, the Europe 30 average, and the United States, it has lower income inequality and 
higher social mobility, life expectancy, social progress, and life satisfaction. The Netherlands 
also performs well on elements of growth and prosperity. Its per capita GDP in 2019 was just 
shy of $57,000 (at constant 2017 international dollars), considerably above the Europe 30 
average of $45,300. However, inward foreign direct investment flows are weak in comparison 
with other regions, which could be explained by large financial flows following corporate 
restructurings.48 The economy ran a relatively high current account surplus of about 7 percent 
of GDP in 2020, and it carries relatively low public and private debt (although some of the 
private debt links to the country’s pension system setup). 

Large corporations in the Netherlands lag behind both the Europe 30 average and their 
US counterparts on return on invested capital, with a gap of nearly 40 percent against the 
US average (Exhibit 28). They trail US companies by an even larger margin of 75 percent on 
growth in revenue and are behind the Europe 30 average. On R&D intensity, Dutch firms 
are close to the Europe 30 average but nearly 40 percent behind their US counterparts. 
Only on capital expenditure as a share of invested capital stock do large corporates in the 
Netherlands come close to the Europe 30 and US averages.

below US counterparts

P oland’s position on sustainability is mixed (Exhibit 29). Per capita carbon emissions 

were lower in 2019 than the average of the Europe 30 and only just higher than those 
of China. This position is partly a function of the stage of economic development. In 

both China and Poland, emissions per unit of GDP are significantly higher than in the Europe 
30 and the United States. Moreover, Poland has significant higher consumption of fossil fuels 
as a percentage of primary energy consumption, with coal notably dominating the power 
sector. Poland also has a mixed record on inclusion. On the positive side, income inequality as 
measured by the Gini index is lower than in any of the three regions highlighted in this analysis. 
Its poverty rate—at the national poverty line—is in line with the Europe 30 average, below the 
rate in the United States but above the rate in China. On social mobility, life expectancy, social 
progress, and life satisfaction, Poland scores above China but below the Europe 30 average 
and the United States. On growth and prosperity, Poland’s economy lags behind both the 
Europe 30 average and the United States on the level of per capita GDP, but per capita GDP is 
growing rapidly, and the gap is narrowing, while remaining far behind the Europe 30 average. 
Poland also has a healthy current account balance and relatively low levels of private debt 
compared with the three major regions. 

Corporate Poland lags behind both the Europe 30 average and the United States on return 
on invested capital but is ahead on revenue growth and on capital expenditure as a share of 
invested capital (Exhibit 30). The sample size of large companies in the European innovation 
scoreboard was too small in Poland to provide comparative figures on R&D intensity.

S pain has a strong record on sustainability, ahead of the Europe 30 average, the United 

States, and China on per capita CO2 emissions in 2018 by some margin (Exhibit 31). 
This reflects Spain’s high use of solar power. Performance on inclusion is mixed. 

Income inequality is higher than the Europe 30 average, and the rate of poverty far higher 
than that average. Yet Spain has an above-average score on the Social Mobility Index. The 
country clearly underperforms on growth and prosperity. Growth in per capita GDP between 
2000 and 2019 was lower than that of China, the United States, and the average of the 
Europe 30, reflecting the fact that Spain suffered deeply from the banking and real estate 
crisis from 2008 and the eurozone crisis that followed. 

Looking at corporate performance, Spain underperforms both the Europe 30 average and US 
companies on return on invested capital and R&D intensity (Exhibit 32). Relatively weak return 
on investment capital may, to an extent, reflect a sector mix with high shares of infrastructure 
and retail. Interestingly, however, revenue growth is much higher than the Europe 30 average, 
and near that of US companies. This could reflect a strong bounce-back from the Spanish 
economic crisis that began in 2008.

I n common with much of Scandinavia, Sweden has a strong record overall on all three 

elements of sustainable and inclusive growth (Exhibit 33). Its per capita CO2 emissions 
are below the Europe 30 average, and on consumption of fossil fuels, it trails the rest of 
Europe, the United States, and China. Sweden’s rate has been rising since 2011, which may 
reflect the fact that the country has welcomed many refugees. According to Eurostat, non-
EU citizens are at the highest risk of poverty and social exclusion. Within the EU, the risk of 
poverty or social exclusion recorded for non-EU citizens was highest in Greece at 58 percent, 
followed by Sweden and Spain, both at 56 percent.49 Sweden’s poverty rate exceeds the 
Europe 30 average. However, Sweden performs strongly on inclusion. For instance, income 
inequality is significantly lower than the Europe 30 average, the United States, and China. 
Sweden also has a positive record on growth and prosperity. Its per capita GDP is well above 
the Europe 30 average and only modestly behind that of the United States. 

Sweden’s companies are either on a par with or above the Europe 30 average on return on 
invested capital, revenue growth, and R&D intensity (Exhibit 34). Indeed, revenue growth 
is a touch above that of US corporations. Capital expenditure relative to invested stock of 
capital is nearly 20 percent below that of US companies and somewhat below the Europe 
30 average.

S witzerland’s per capita CO2 emissions (consumption based) were high relative to those 

of China and the Europe 30 average in 2018, but just below those of the United States 
(Exhibit 35).50 However, it should be noted that Switzerland’s relatively high emissions 
come largely from CO2 embedded in imported products and services. Switzerland produces 
about 37 metric tons of CO₂ domestically per year but imports about 116 million metric tons.51 
The country’s consumption of fossil fuels in 2019 was comparatively very low. As a share of 
GDP, Switzerland’s emissions are far lower than in the rest of Europe and the other two major 
regions. On inclusion and well-being, Switzerland is in line with the Europe 30 average on 
income inequality but below average on its poverty rate at national poverty lines. However, 
on other indicators of well-being—social mobility, life expectancy, social progress, and life 
satisfaction—Switzerland is above the Europe 30 average, China, and the United States. 
Switzerland’s record on growth has been below par; between 2000 and 2019, its per capita 
GDP growth was significantly far lower than for the Europe 30, China, and the United States. 
Moreover, inward foreign direct investment flows have been negative since 2018, when US tax 
reforms led to a large repatriation of capital and earnings by US parent companies.52 Public 
debt is relatively low, but private debt is high, not least because of a taxation and pension 
system favoring mortgages. 

On return on invested capital, revenue growth, and R&D intensity, corporations 
headquartered in Switzerland outperform the Europe 30 average (Exhibit 36). On return on 
invested capital and R&D intensity, they also outperform US companies. Revenue growth 
is far higher than that of the Europe 30, which reflects the highly global exposure of large 
companies. Capital expenditure relative to invested capital stock is lower than the Europe 30 
average and that of US companies.

the Europe 30 average

T he performance of the United Kingdom on sustainability is stronger than that of 

the Europe 30, with somewhat lower per capita emissions and lower emissions 
as a share of GDP (Exhibit 37). However, its use of fossil fuels is higher than the 

Europe 30 average (although lower than in China or the United States). On inclusion, income 
inequality and the poverty rate in the United Kingdom are significantly higher than the Europe 
30 average. On a range of measures of well-being, the United Kingdom is in line with the 
Europe 30 average, although social mobility is somewhat below that average. On growth and 
prosperity, per capita GDP is in line with the Europe 30 average, but growth in per capita GDP 
lagged behind that average from 2000 to 2019. On other key metrics, including the current 
account balance, public debt, and private debt, the United Kingdom is not as well positioned 
as the Europe 30 average. 

The picture for large companies in the United Kingdom is mixed (Exhibit 38). On the positive 
side, returns on invested capital stand out; they are higher than the Europe 30 average and 
close to the US level. Capital expenditure as a share of invested capital is broadly in line with 
the Europe 30 average and a little lower than in the United States. Revenue growth is only 
about half that of the Europe 30 average, and R&D intensity was weak in 2019. 

In the next chapter, we look at relative performance on ten transversal technologies in 
more detail.

4. Europe is falling 

behind on transversal 
technologies

As next-generation technologies take hold, they increasingly determine competitive 
dynamics for companies—and Europe’s lagging position is a growing vulnerability. 

This chapter digs into the specific technology advances on which Europe’s future 
competitiveness and prosperity depend. We draw on previous McKinsey research that 
analyzed more than 40 individual technologies by technical maturity, industry impact, and 
momentum, ultimately homing in on ten technology trends that could reshape the future of 
markets and industries over the next few decades.53 For every trend, McKinsey calculated 
a momentum score based on the growth of the underlying technologies, looking at patent 
filings, publications, news mentions, online searches, private investment, and the number of 
companies making those investments. Because these trends are spreading across sectors, 
we refer to them here as “transversal technologies.” 

This research examines where Europe stands with regard to each of the ten transversal 
technologies that McKinsey identified as having transformative potential (Exhibit 39). We 
analyze the comparative positions of China, the Europe 30, and the United States, and the 
results are sobering. We find that Europe lags on eight of the ten transversal technologies, 
trailing in all three of the dimensions we considered (innovation, production, and adoption). 
Its average factor against the leading or second-best region is, respectively, 0.6, 0.6, and 0.7 
(see Box 3, “Understanding Europe’s factor scores for innovation, production, and adoption”). 
Addressing these gaps will be critical to Europe’s future competitiveness and resilience.

Europe lags on eight of ten 
transversal technologies, trailing 
in all three of the dimensions 
considered (innovation, 
production, and adoption).

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gapBox 3

Understanding Europe’s factor scores for innovation, production, and adoption 

For each of the ten transversal 
technologies, we analyze European 
competitiveness against the United 
States and China in three stages of 
product development: innovation, 
production, and adoption. 

In the innovation stage, we 
use metrics such as number of 
publications, number or share of 
patents (both total and world-
class patents), venture capital 
funding, research and development 
expenditure, and public funding 
(especially relevant when the 

technology in question is still in the 
early stage of development).

To assess the production stage, we 
used metrics such as private equity 
and corporate funding (including 
M&A) as well as the number and 
(when available) market share of 
leading players.

Finally, in the adoption stage, we 
compared the regions with metrics 
of adoption by end consumers 
(companies, consumers, or both), 
end-market market shares by region, 
and other ad hoc metrics specific to 

each of the transversal technologies 
(for example, number of robots 
installed for next-level automation 
and number of 5G subscriptions for 
future of connectivity). 

The “European factor” refers to the 
relative European position versus 
the leading or second-best region on 
the range of metrics cited above. For 
instance, if Europe issues 200,000 
patents per year in a given field while 
the corresponding number for the 
United States is 400,000, the factor 
is 0.5 times.

Next-level automation

Next-level automation includes robotics hardware, additive manufacturing, and virtualization 
processes such as digital twins that help to improve operational efficiency, shorten 
development cycles, and thus accelerate time to market.54 This transversal technology is 
forecast to generate gross value added of €130 billion by 2040 and is set to drive change in 
multiple key sectors. 

Across the three stages (innovation, production, and adoption), Europe is lagging behind the 
leading or second-best region, with an average factor of 0.8. Given its strong installed base 
and its current edge in production and adoption, Europe is well positioned, but patent activity 
and startup investments nevertheless suggest that some ground could be lost.

Why does this transversal technology matter?
Next-level automation and virtualization have huge transformative potential. Automating 
additional activities can enable businesses to improve performance by reducing errors and 
improving quality and speed—in some cases outperforming what humans can do.

Automation—to be specific, robotic automation—contributes to productivity. MGI has 
estimated that automation overall—including process automation, which is discussed in 
the section on applied AI in this chapter—could raise productivity growth globally by 0.8 to 
1.4 percent annually. These technologies could touch almost every occupation. MGI estimates 
that about half of all the activities people are paid to do in the world’s workforce could 
potentially be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies.55 Digital twins 
and additive manufacturing do not have an impact on productivity in this way. 

One of the core automation technologies is robotics hardware, which has three major 
segments. The first is industrial robots, including collaborative robots (cobots). Cobots are 
designed to perform tasks alongside human workers. The level of collaboration can vary, 
from coexistence to responsive interaction; in the latter case, the robot responds in real time 
to a person’s movement. Second is professional service robots, which are used for specific 
commercial applications, such as automated guided vehicles, warehouse automation, or 
medical surgery robots. The third segment comprises domestic service robots, such as 
lawnmowers and toy robots. 

The total robotics hardware market was valued at around $25 billion in 2020.56 In terms of 
market value, industrial robots accounted for about 54 percent, professional service robots 
for around 28 percent, and domestic service robots for about 18 percent. 

Boosted by a wider range of offerings and applications, cobots have recently been the 
fastest-growing segment of industrial robotics, increasing at 19 percent per annum from 
2017 to 2020. This is still a nascent market, however, representing about 6 percent of total 
industrial robot installations in 2020 (a share that is expected to hit 13 percent in 2022).57 The 
reality is that cobots do not often collaborate, but rather coexist in the same physical space 
without requiring a fence. This fenceless operation drives down associated infrastructure 
costs. Moreover, the robot arm is also five to ten times less expensive than a full-scale 
industrial robot arm, and this is driving their adoption for many tasks where the business case 
for robots has not yet been made. 

The growth of professional service robots is now taking off, with an expected compound 
annual growth rate of about 31 percent between 2020 and 2023 (compared with about 
8 percent for industrial robots).58 This segment is expected to account for nearly half of the 
robotics hardware market by 2025. Within this segment, logistics and automated guided 
vehicles (AGVs) systems are expected to grow at about 19 percent per year to 2025, driven 
by sweeping automation in warehouses as e-commerce demand rises and delivery cycles 
shorten. Notably, AGVs are increasingly being replaced by autonomous mobile robots (AMRs).

55

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gapAMRs are a step up from AGVs. While AGVs can detect obstacles in front of them, they cannot 
navigate round them. AMRs navigate using maps constructed by their software. By 2025, 
two-thirds of the market could consist of AMRs. Adoption of medical robots is also expected 
to soar in coming years, reflecting a wider scope of potential applications and the benefits of 
time and cost savings that enable improved clinical outcomes.59

Additive manufacturing, also commonly referred to as 3-D printing, is the process of building 
a physical object (often with plastics, steel, or ceramics) using 3-D-model data, typically 
layer upon layer.60 The total market for additive 3-D printing stood at $13 billion in 2020.61 The 
market is expected to grow at a 20 percent compound annual rate in the next ten years.62 
About 10 percent of current manufacturing processes across industries are expected to be 
replaced by additive manufacturing by 2030.63

Finally, virtualization and other dematerializing processes enable the virtual engineering 
and improved operating performance of physical assets. Digital twins are one of the primary 
examples; this involves creating a digital replica of a physical asset or process, combining 
data from both digital and physical worlds. The use of digital twins is expected to have tripled 
between 2018 and 2022, with 70 percent of manufacturers using them regularly and adoption 
rapidly increasing in construction.64 

With its industrial prowess, Europe is still a robotics leader, but it is increasingly 
challenged by the United States on innovation and China on adoption
Europe has a convincing lead in the relative installed base of robotic automation technologies. 
However, China is catching up fast and has been the largest end market for industrial robots 
since 2014. Furthermore, the United States has been out in front on world-class patents for 
automation and process virtualization. The starkest gap is in venture capital; both the United 
States and China attracted far more funding for automation startups than Europe (Exhibit 40). 
While the focus of this section is robotic automation, Europe’s relative position may be even 
less favorable in additive manufacturing and digital twin technologies. 

Innovation
The United States filed the most patents for automation and process virtualization in 2019, at 
7,197. The totals for Europe and China were 5,772 and 4,472, respectively.65 The United States 
also led in terms of world-class patents that year, accounting for 31 percent of the global total; 
Europe was not far behind with 25 percent; China had 15 percent (for reference, the rest of 
Asia combined for 24 percent).66 

Between 2015 and 2020, the United States and China attracted about the same amount of 
venture capital funding on robotics, with $5.4 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. Europe 
lagged well behind, at about $1.0 billion.67 Europe has invested more heavily in certain 
segments such as medical robotics—an area where Europe has attracted nearly 4.5 times the 
venture capital as US startups in recent years.68

McKinsey Global InstituteProduction 
Europe leads on production of robots in terms of volume but is behind the United 
States on external funding of more mature companies, that is, private equity and 
corporate investments.69 

The four leading industrial robots OEMs as of 2020 represent 70 percent of the market 
in revenue terms. Two of them, ABB and Kuka, are European players, with 27 percent of 
the market combined. The other two players are Japanese, with 43 percent combined 
market share.70 

Europe has a convincing lead in the production of professional service robots, with 55 percent 
of market share in 2019, followed by North America at 34 percent and Asia with 11 percent.71 
Europe also has nearly half of the world’s service robot suppliers in 2019, with 438 companies, 
compared with 257 based in the Americas and 185 in Asia.72 

Denmark-based Universal Robots leads global cobot production with a market share of 
about 37 percent. The next-largest manufacturers are FANUC (based in Japan) and Techman 
(Taiwan), each of which has 9 percent of the market, and Aubo, a Chinese company with 
5 percent of the market.73 The European market accounts for around 43 percent of Universal 
Robots’ revenue; the Americas represent 29 percent and Asia–Pacific 27 percent of the 
company’s revenue.74

acquisitions, and joint ventures) between 2015 and 2020, which typically target more mature 
companies, the United States led with about $36 billion.75 Europe’s figure was $16 billion and 
China’s $10 billion. However, Europe ramped up investment in 2020 to about $7 billion, higher 
than the $5 billion invested in the United States in that year.76

Adoption
Europe is still the leader in terms of robot density. The region averages 271 units per 10,000 
employees, compared with 255 in the United States and 246 in China.77 But Europe’s leading 
position reflects the heavy use of robots by a relatively small number of automation-intense 
companies and industries rather than broad adoption. In Germany, for example, just five plants 
account for 52 percent of the country’s total robot stock. 

China is catching up fast, having become the largest market for robot installation since 2014. 
Its robot density increased dramatically, from 68 in 2016 to 246 in 2020; its global ranking 
for density rose from 25th to ninth. In 2020, 168,400 industrial robots were installed in China, 
with the lion’s share in the electronics and automotive industries. In the same year, 41,800 
industrial robots were installed in Europe (with half of those in Germany) and 30,800 were 
installed in the United States.78 However, those lower figures in Europe and the United States 
may partly reflect a shortage of raw and intermediate products due to COVID-19 restrictions. 

2. Future of connectivity

The world’s digital connections are getting faster and enabling new types of remote and 
automated processes in addition to communications and information flows, with 5G and the 
Internet of Things (IoT) being the most promising technologies. 

Previous MGI research identified hundreds of use cases across more than 17 commercial 
domains that can run on an enhanced digital backbone, with the countries that are most 
connected today capturing much of the value.79 McKinsey estimates that next-generation 
connectivity could generate between €1 trillion and €2 trillion in gross value added by 2040.

Europe lags on indicators across the three stages of development, with an average factor of 
0.6. But the situation diverges depending on the technology. Europe is largely on a par with 
the other major regions on 5G but trails when it comes to the IoT. Looking at the individual 
stages, Europe is lagging on innovation and production, with a factor of 0.7 against the 
leading or second-best region, but it is far behind on production and adoption at 0.3.

Why does this transversal technology matter? 
Superfast connectivity supports the creation of new services and business models linked 
to sensor-enabled intelligent products. It opens possibilities for new offerings such as 
predictive services and augmented-intelligence services. It also creates the potential for 
companies to personalize offerings more seamlessly across channels and to heighten 
customer experiences. 

The most prominent connectivity technology is 5G, which enables connections with 
much higher speed, less latency, and dramatically reduced power consumption than its 
predecessors.80 It supports, for instance, private networks, edge computing, and mission-
critical applications. For this reason, 5G is a catalyst for many other technology trends, such 
as smart cities, Industry 4.0, and smart grids.81 

75  Corporate investment refers to merger and acquisitions deals, acquisitions of noncontrolling stakes in companies, and 

joint ventures.

United States could hit this milestone earlier—by 2023 and 2025, respectively, according to 
McKinsey telecoms specialists. 

One of the most significant applications of 5G is the IoT, networks of connected devices. 
Sensors and actuators networked to computing systems can monitor or manage the health 
and actions of connected objects and machines.83 

5G: China leads on many metrics but not knowledge creation 
Between 2003 and 2020, Europe far outpaced the United States and China in 5G-related 
scientific publications. However, the United States holds more world-class patents. Europe 
and China each hold a lead in different segments of 5G technology production, while China is 
the world leader on 5G adoption (Exhibit 41).

While Europe produces the greatest number of scientific publications, the United States leads 
on world-class patents, and China has the edge in technical innovations. Between 2003 and 
2020, Europe had a convincing lead in 5G-related scientific publications, with about triple 
the total of China and the United States.84 However, the United States has the highest share 
of world-class patents at 34 percent, compared with Europe’s 21 percent share and China’s 
14 percent.85 For patents on approved technical contributions to the 5G standard, the picture 
is different—China had 38 percent of patents in 2021, Europe 20 percent, and the United 
States 17 percent.86

Production
Europe and China each hold an edge in different aspects of 5G technology production. 
European players (Ericsson and Nokia) captured nearly 50 percent of the radio access 
network (RAN) market in 2021; two Chinese players (Huawei and ZTE) captured 35 percent.87 
In the mobile core network market, Huawei and ZTE held between 35 and 45 percent of 
the global market in 2021, followed closely by Ericsson and Nokia with shares of 30 to 
40 percent combined.88 

Looking ahead, a move toward Open RAN standards will likely shift a higher share of value to 
software development—a domain in which, traditionally, US firms have competitive strength.

Adoption
China leads the world in 5G adoption. As of January 2022, it had about 916,000 5G base 
stations against 50,000 in the United States and 112,000 in Europe.89 China is by far the 
biggest market for 5G subscriptions, with 69 percent of the global total, compared with 
12 percent for the United States and 5 percent for Europe in 2021. By 2027, China is forecast 
to maintain its lead over the United States and Europe, but to a somewhat lesser extent, with 
30 percent, 15 percent, and 9 percent of global 5G subscriptions, respectively. 90 In 2024, 
penetration of 5G (measured as the percent of connections) is forecast to be highest in China 
at 67 percent, followed closely by the United States with 65 percent; Europe is expected to be 
well behind, at 35 percent.91 

On IoT, China leads on metrics for innovation and adoption, but the United States leads 
on investment and revenue 
In IoT-related patent filings, Europe has produced less than half of China’s world-leading tally. 
Among the world’s largest IoT companies, the share of revenue generated by US players is 
more than triple that of European players (Exhibit 42).

McKinsey Global InstituteInnovation 
As of 2019, China had filed the most IoT patents, with 42,000, nearly 2.5 times the European 
tally. The United States was close behind, with about 38,000.92 

From 2015 to 2020, the United States had by far the highest total investment in startups 
(about $2.1 billion) and the highest average commitment per startup (about $55 million). In 
China, the comparable figures were about $325 million and $45 million. Europe came in well 
below, at $60 million and $3.3 million.93 

Production 
The United States currently holds the largest market share in the IoT. In 2020, 35 percent 
of the revenue generated by the world’s 100 largest IoT companies went to US-based 
companies. This compares with 26 percent generated by Chinese companies and 10 percent 
generated by European companies.94 

Adoption
China is the global leader in IoT adoption. Its three largest telecommunications players 
provided 75 percent of global IoT connections in 2020, up sharply from 27 percent in 2015.95 
AT&T in the United States and Vodafone in the United Kingdom had shares of 6 percent and 
4 percent of cellular IoT, respectively. By 2025, China and the United States are also expected 
to lead in the industrial use of IoT, with about 37 percent and 32 percent of the global market, 
respectively. Europe is forecast to have a share of some 23 percent.96

3. Distributed infrastructure

Distributed infrastructure encompasses cloud and edge computing. Cloud computing 
enables companies to use computing power in centralized locations. Off-site centralized 
servers are central to the business models of anything as a service (XaaS) companies 
providing infrastructure (IaaS), system infrastructure software (SISaaS), platforms (PaaS), and 
software (SaaS). However, the cloud is not an exclusive tool for all workloads. Edge computing, 
which consists of on-site, nearby, or decentralized infrastructure and devices, is placed near 
the locations where insights need to be generated or data need to be stored. These resource-
dense centers decrease latency time by more efficiently retrieving data from the centralized 
and dense cloud, reducing cost. Edge computing increases speed and lowers concern about 
data privacy since computation happens more locally (with central control). This aligns well 
with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and other data residency regulations. 

McKinsey estimates that distributed infrastructure will generate gross value added of 
€400 billion to €1.6 trillion by 2040 as the market grows. 

Europe lags behind on distributed infrastructure, with an average factor of 0.3—one of the 
lowest scores of the ten transversal technologies. Europe has an insignificant share in the 
production stage (0.1) as well as an innovation gap (0.2). Its adoption factor is closer, at 0.7.

Why does this transversal technology matter?
McKinsey has estimated that cloud computing can unlock more than $1 trillion in value 
for Fortune 500 companies alone. Almost all of that comes from business innovation and 
optimization rather than simply lowering IT costs. Distributed infrastructure essentially 
democratizes computing power. The most powerful benefits to businesses are accelerated 
time to market, less complex innovation, easier scalability, and lower risk. Cloud platforms 
enable companies to deploy new digital experiences for customers in days rather than 
months. They enable analytics that would not have been possible or would have been too 
expensive on traditional platforms.97

Cloud computing is a relatively mature market, but it continues to grow. Spending on cloud-
related services (IaaS, SISaaS, PaaS, and SaaS) is expected to more than double between 
2021 and 2025, from $385 billion to $809 billion.98 

Edge computing is a smaller and comparatively nascent segment. However, spending on edge 
hardware, services, and software is expected to grow rapidly at a forecast compound annual 
rate of 16 percent between 2021 and 2025, from $153 billion to $275 billion, with 50 percent 
of that on edge services.99 

Growth in cloud and edge computing comes at the expense of spending on traditional IT 
infrastructure. By 2025, McKinsey estimates that more than 75 percent of enterprise-
generated data will be processed by edge or cloud computing.100

The United States leads on metrics of innovation, production, and adoption, with Europe 
and China sharing second place
The United States is the clear global leader in distributed infrastructure, with Europe and 
China lagging but roughly matching each other. The US lead holds across patents and market 
share (Exhibit 43). In fact, the top ten cloud and edge companies by market capitalization are 
all based in the United States. European players account for less than 0.1 percent of global 
market capitalization.

McKinsey Global InstituteInnovation
The United States leads on metrics of knowledge, with 53 percent of world-class patents as 
of 2019. For Europe, the figure is 14 percent, and for China, 13 percent.101 The United States 
also captured 55 percent of all global venture capital funding for distributed infrastructure 
startups between 2015 and 2020, compared with 37 percent for Asia (including China) and 
5 percent for Europe.102

Production
Here again, the United States leads—on funding, revenue, and market capitalization. It 
accounted for 76 percent of private equity and M&A funding between 2015 and 2020. Asia 
(including China) had 13 percent, and Europe less than 10 percent.103 Four US companies—
Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta (then Facebook)—contributed more than 70 percent 
of the $111 billion of total global investment in cloud in 2019. Three Chinese companies—
Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent—had a combined share of 10 percent. No European player spent 
more than $1 billion.104 

101  World-class patents are identified through the number of countries where a patent is actively held, the relevance of 

the technology, and the number of citations of the patents in other patent applications; the country is identified by the 
address of the patent holder(s). See Jan C. Breitenger, Benjamin Dierks, and Thomas Rausch, World-class patents in 
future technologies: The innovation power of East Asia, North America, and Europe, Bertelsmann Stiftung, June 2020.

for 73 percent of revenue from cloud services in 2021. Chinese players had a share of 
9 percent, with no European player capturing more than 2 percent of the market.105 Looking 
at specific segments, the picture is similar. First, in the IaaS segment, European players have 
an insignificant market share, with no company accounting for more than 1 percent as of 
2020. In contrast, US companies accounted for 67 percent of global revenue, and Chinese 
companies held 14 percent.106 In the case of SaaS, the United States generated 85 percent 
of revenue in 2020, the United Kingdom 7 percent, and China 4 percent. However, China 
appears to be taking market share from both the United Kingdom and the United States at an 
increasing pace.107

Finally, looking at the market capitalization of cloud computing companies as of 2019, the top 
ten companies in the world are all based in the United States.108 European players account for 
less than 0.1 percent of global market capitalization. 

Adoption
European companies are lagging behind their US peers on investment in cloud services. 
Gartner estimated that US companies would direct about 14 percent of their total IT spending 
to the cloud, while many European (French, German, Italian, Spanish) companies and China 
are expected to spend about 8 percent each by 2022. Within Europe, the Netherlands and the 
United Kingdom stand out but are still not on a par with the United States.109 The highest share 
of IT infrastructure in the cloud is in the Americas, at 52 percent; Europe’s figure is 47 percent, 
and Asia’s is 42 percent as of 2021.110 

4. Next-generation computing

Next-generation computing largely comprises quantum computing and neuromorphic 
hardware. Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to deliver 
advances in computation to solve complex problems, typically statistical in nature, that are 
difficult for current computers to handle.111 Neuromorphic processing units are hardware 
inspired by the human brain. They are one of the key types of specialized hardware emerging 
to overcome the limitations of general-purpose central processing units, such as energy 
consumption and data rate limitations from accessing external memory. Neuromorphic 
hardware can be designed to reflect the structure of neural networks, leading to performance 
and energy improvements for training and inference. 

The technology could generate up to €1 trillion in gross value added across industries by 
2040.112 Of this, between €300 billion and €600 billion of value could be generated in 
automotive, chemicals, finance, and pharmaceuticals.113 

Europe is significantly behind the leading or second-best region with an average factor of 
0.5 across the three stages, even though European governments have increased funding for 
next-generation computing.

quantum computing and 
related fields from Europe 
since 2010

Why does this transversal technology matter? 
Next-generation computing can radically accelerate development cycles and lower barriers to 
entry across industries. High computational capabilities enable new ways to use AI, including, 
for instance, molecule-level simulation. This can significantly reduce the testing needed 
for a range of applications, leading to disruption in industries such as materials, chemicals, 
and pharmaceuticals. It can enable highly personalized product development, including in 
medicine, and faster diffusion of self-driving vehicles. In biological and biomedical research, 
for instance, scientists used to rely on finding random mutations to identify beneficial traits, 
but the interaction between biology and ever faster and more sophisticated computing 
is helping to accelerate the R&D process and raise its productivity.114 In 2020, the global 
quantum computing market was valued at $412 million.115 

The United States and China are ahead in the quantum computing race on 
many indicators
China leads both the United States and the Europe 30 on share of world-class patents, 
the United States is well ahead of both other regions on private investment, and China has 
the most public investment of the three regions. Europe is catching up and leading with 
publications related to quantum computing and related fields. Today, the field is nascent 
(which is why we do not include an analysis of production or adoption), but it is expected to 
experience substantive innovation and investment in coming years (Exhibit 44). Europe has 
recognized the importance of this transversal technology with nearly $9 billion in public 
funding up to 2021.116 However, private investment in this field by US and Chinese tech giants 
is far greater.

Europe leads on publications related to quantum computing and other related fields. Since 
2010, the region has generated 35 percent of relevant articles globally. The US figure was 
28 percent, and China’s 13 percent.117 

McKinsey data show that Chinese researchers had 53 percent of patents related to quantum 
computing at the end of 2021, the EU approximately 11 percent, and the United States about 
10 percent.118 

The United States and China are investing heavily in quantum computing. Of the top ten major 
tech companies investing in quantum computing, 50 percent are based in the United States 
and 40 percent in China; the EU is not represented in the top ten.119 In the United States, tech 
firms including Alphabet, Amazon, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Microsoft are investing their 
own capital in in-house quantum computing innovation and research. In China, the same 
applies to Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent. The companies do not disclose most of their 
investment publicly, but some announcements have given an idea of scale. For instance, IBM 
said it invested $400 million in quantum computing research initiatives in 2021.120 Between 
2017 and 2019, Alibaba invested $15 billion in a three-year program of quantum computing 
R&D.121 Alphabet announced plans to spend several billion dollars to build a new fault-tolerant 
quantum computer by 2029.122 Companies such as Alibaba, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft have 
already launched commercial quantum computing cloud services.123 With time, the complexity 
as well as the types of problem that can be addressed will increase.124 

The United States also has a lead on venture capital and startup investment. As of the end 
of 2021, announced and raised startup funding in quantum computing totaled $2.1 billion, 
more than double the tally in 2020.125 Between 2010 and 2021, venture capital funding in 
North America totaled $1 billion; in Europe, the figure was $265 million. Private funding of 
quantum computing overall is expected to continue to increase sharply as the technology 
commercializes, and the United States is expected to maintain its lead.126 Of the ten largest 
venture capital deals in quantum computing ever recorded, four involved US companies; two 
others were in the United Kingdom.127 China is not represented in the top ten venture capital 
deals, but, again, it is difficult to know for certain what funding is under way. Of the top 11 
quantum computing startups, four are US-based and one is Europe-based.128 They include 
IonQ, Rigetti, Zapata, and PsiQuantum in the United States, and Quantinuum in Europe.129 
Chinese startups do not feature much on such lists, but there is evidence of activity. For 
instance, in 2021, Origin Quantum unveiled China’s first homegrown quantum computing 
operating system.130

On public funding of quantum computing, China is in the lead, with Europe a close second. By 
2021, China had invested between $10 billion and $15 billion of public funding. Europe has 
committed nearly $9 billion of combined EU and national investment in quantum research and 
infrastructure. The United States committed about $2 billion.131

McKinsey Global Institute5. Applied AI

€1t–€2t

of gross value added could 
come from applied AI 
by 2040

This technology applies AI algorithms to enable computers to make sense of real-world data, 
including video and images (using computer vision), text (using natural language processing), 
and audio (using speech technology). It contributes to the digitization of natural environments, 
eliminating labor needs or complementing labor where technology can work better. This is 
done by training algorithms with sample data, recognizing patterns, interpreting, and then 
acting on the information.132 

The technology could generate €1 trillion to €2 trillion of gross value added by 2040. 

Europe lags very significantly behind on many metrics for applied AI, with an average factor of 
0.4 across the innovation, production, and adoption stages. This is despite increased public 
funding and the fact that the region leads on publications. 

Why does this transversal technology matter? 
AI applications will eventually augment the way humans interact with machines. They will 
power automation, accelerate R&D and development cycles, and eliminate repetitive tasks. 
To give just a few examples, machine learning can be used to detect anomalies and therefore 
enable predictive maintenance and quality control in manufacturing. AI-driven logistics 
optimization can cut costs by enabling real-time forecasting. AI can also provide customer 
service and improve personalization through the use of improved speech recognition and 
more efficient processing.133

Applied AI is likely to have a significant impact over the next decade, not only economically 
but also on security issues. (AI is vital in swarm intelligence used in defense applications, 
for example.)134 The global AI market was valued at $36 billion in 2020 and was already 
up to $57 billion in 2021.135 It is expected to be valued at more than $360 billion by 2028, 
representing compound annual growth of 30 percent between 2021 to 2028.136 

A 2021 McKinsey Global Survey indicated that AI adoption has continued to rise globally; 
56 percent of all respondents said that they had adopted AI in at least one function, up from 
50 percent in 2020.137 Previous MGI research looked at five broad categories of AI (computer 
vision, natural language, virtual assistants, robotic process automation, and advanced 
machine learning) and estimated that about 70 percent of companies will have adopted at 
least one of the five by 2030. The analysis found that AI had the potential to deliver additional 
global economic activity of about $13 trillion by 2030, or 1.2 percent additional GDP growth 
per year. If delivered, this impact would compare well with that of other general-purpose 
technologies through history.138

The United States is the world’s AI leader
Today, the United States leads in applied AI, being home to corporations responsible for 
65 percent of global private investment. For its part, China is a full-spectrum peer competitor 
with high adoption of certain AI applications.139 Europe is in third position but is ramping 
up, having committed $3 billion to $4 billion in public funding to AI development in 2019. 
However, front-runners are in a position to capture the majority of the economic value that will 
eventually be created (Exhibit 45).140

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gapInnovation
The United States currently leads on several indicators of AI innovation. In 2019, it had a 
47 percent share of AI-related world-class patents; China had a 17 percent share and the 
EU 16 percent.141 In the same year, however, China had the biggest share—22 percent—of 
peer-reviewed AI publications in the world; Europe had 21 percent, and the United States 
15 percent.142 A majority of these publications are generated in academia, but government 
institutions are the second-largest source of publications in Europe and China. In contrast, in 
the United States, the second-largest source of publications is corporations. 

The United States also leads on AI venture capital investment, with $8 billion of funding in 
2020 against $5 billion in China and $2 billion in Europe.143 China led in public investment, 
with an estimated $8 billion ($5 billion nondefense and $2 billion defense) in 2018.144 In 2020, 
US public investment in AI was $6 billion, of which $5 billion was for defense.145 The closest 
comparative figures for public investment in AI in Europe are for 2019, when the region 
invested an estimated $3 billion to $4 billion; this total includes spending both by the EU and 
by member states and individual countries.146

private companies in the 
United States than in Europe

Production 
The United States invested six times as much as Europe in AI private companies, and more 
than twice as much as China. In 2020, the US private sector invested about $24 billion in AI, 
compared with $10 billion in China and $4 billion in the EU.147 

AI market share is also highest in the United States, which has a combination of established 
tech giants and startups with the potential to disrupt hardware and cybersecurity. Of the 
seven giants of the AI age, four (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft) are in the United 
States, and three (Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent) are in China. The United States is also home to 
two hardware giants, Intel and Nvidia.148 Of the ten AI startups with the highest valuations, five 
are in the United States, four in China, and one in Europe (Switzerland).149 

Adoption 
Europe lags behind the United States and China in adoption of practical AI applications, 
including facial recognition, voice recognition, and fintech.150 According to McKinsey’s Global 
Survey on Artificial Intelligence 2021, about 61 percent of Chinese organizations had adopted 
AI in at least one business function.151 This compared with 51 percent of organizations in North 
America and 46 percent of those in Europe.152 Use of this technology is growing quickly. In 
each of the three regions, company adoption of at least one AI technology roughly doubled 
between 2018 and 2021. 

In speech technology, Chinese firms are attracting more users than their US counterparts 
in every language, including English. In facial recognition, SenseTime and Megvii have 
developed cutting-edge applications that can identify individuals from China’s population 
of 1.4 billion in seconds. However, concerns about privacy have limited adoption in both the 
EU and the United States.153 The world’s top voice recognition startup, China’s iFlytek, has 
700 million users, almost twice the number of people who speak to Apple’s Siri. In fintech, 
significant usage of Chinese mobile apps has generated increased data about individual 
consumer behavior, which can feed into other fintech applications including AI-driven 
assessments. WeChat Pay’s 900 million Chinese users far outnumber Apple Pay’s 44 million 
users in the United States, for example. While two-thirds of Americans still rely on credit 
cards, 90 percent of urban Chinese primarily use mobile payments (spending $150 on mobile 
platforms for every dollar Americans spend). 154 

6. Future of programming

The future of programming describes the changing environment for software developers 
due to smarter algorithms that require less manual coding. It is sometimes referred to as 
“Software 2.0.”

According to several estimates, the worldwide market for low- and no-code solutions is 
expected to grow fivefold, from about $13 billion in 2020 to anywhere from $65 billion to 
$80 billion in 2025.155 McKinsey estimates a value at stake for this technology of roughly 
$150 billion by 2040.

On metrics of innovation, Europe is estimated at 0.3 the size of the sole leader, the 
United States.

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gap27%

of global venture capital 
funding of Software 2.0 
and engineering analytics 
companies for Europe vs 
73% for the United States

Why does this transversal technology matter?
Software 2.0 refers to the concept of machine-written programs to reach an operator- or 
human-set goal, such as winning a game of chess.156 The focus of the programmer thus can 
shift from designing the code to designing the overarching framework and ensuring that 
the correct data are used as the input into machine learning. A prominent example of this 
technology is low- or no-code platforms. As the name suggests, these are platforms that 
allow users to tackle problems previously addressable only by trained coders, eliminating 
the need for 90 percent of programming time. Code is still written, but the user creates the 
program through an intuitive interface that does not require as much knowledge of coding 
as before. Gartner estimates that 70 percent of applications will be developed via low- and 
no-code platforms by 2025, compared with less than 25 percent in 2020.157

Software 2.0 enables rapid scaling and diffusion of data-rich AI-driven applications. It 
can enable use cases like autonomous vehicles that are possible only with AI models. It 
also makes it easier for organizations to customize existing code and automate mundane 
programming tasks. Broadly, too, this technology will further accelerate emerging trends 
in machine learning that can surmount some of the complexities that currently hamper the 
development and application of AI models. 

This technology could reduce the workforce required for software development and analytics 
to a fraction of its current levels; alternatively, if the workforce is held constant, Software 2.0 
could accelerate software development. Netflix, for instance, has reduced time to deployment 
16-fold.158 

The United States leads on metrics of innovation and production, far ahead of Europe, 
while China does not appear to have a significant presence
The United States is well ahead of Europe, with 73 percent of global venture capital funding 
of Software 2.0 and engineering analytics companies, followed by Europe with 27 percent.159 
China and the rest of the world do not have a significant presence. Looking specifically at low- 
and no-code startups, venture capital funding is largely concentrated in the United States, 
which has 85 percent of the total; Europe’s figure is 15 percent.160 The United States is also 
ahead on production, being home to 75 percent of the largest low- and no-code platforms; 
Europe accounts for 10 percent of such platforms.161 However, this market is relatively 
fragmented; most applications serve niche needs and have relatively low economies of scale 
(Exhibit 46).

McKinsey Global Institute7. Trust architecture

A trust architecture provides a framework that enables data to flow through a service-
oriented system in a verifiable way. Technologies include blockchain, an environment in which 
users trust a system without necessarily trusting any of its components.162 While blockchain 
is most commonly associated with digital currencies, it can also underpin many other 
applications, such as the tracking of international trade shipments and smart contracts that 
can replace paper-based documentation systems.163 Trust architecture also includes zero-
trust security, an approach to preventing data breaches by eliminating the concept of trust 
by default from an organization’s network architecture and instead following the principle of 
“never trust, always verify” through strict access controls and frequent authentication.164 It 
should be noted, however, that advances in quantum computing could supersede some of the 
current use cases. 

McKinsey estimates that the technology could generate up to €800 billion in gross value 
added by 2040. Gross value added will tend to accrue largely to adopters of the technology. 

Europe lags behind the United States in trust architecture, with a factor of 0.5 scored across 
the innovation, production, and adoption stages. 

Why does this transversal technology matter? 
Trust architecture is important as a way to mitigate cyberrisk, helping commercial 
organizations and individuals verify information, identities, and transactions, conducting 
business with fewer intermediaries and delays. 

Two metrics illustrate the relevance of these technologies. Funds equivalent to about 
10 percent of global GDP could be stored on blockchain technology by 2027.165 And about nine 
billion records were compromised in 2019 because of insufficient security.166

The United States has driven many of the advances in trust architecture and is home to a 
majority of the world’s top blockchain players (Exhibit 47). This trend has particular relevance 
in the country for a number of reasons, including the lack of a standard national ID, a large 
unbanked population that relies on paper payments, and a payment infrastructure that is not 
as modernized as European systems. These issues create a greater need for solutions that 
can improve the speed and security of payments and transactions. Europe, by contrast, does 
not have the same kind of business case.

US private investment in 
blockchain vs $800 million 
from EU companies in 2020

Innovation 
The United States leads on world-class patents with 42 percent of the global total. Europe’s 
share is 19 percent, and China’s 13 percent. The United States is also in front on venture 
capital funding for trust architecture. In 2020, venture capital blockchain funding totaled 
$5 billion in the United States, compared with $2 billion in the EU. In the case of cybersecurity 
venture capital funding, the United States was even further ahead, with total funding of 
$7 billion versus $260 million in the EU.167

Production 
The United States leads on private corporate funding. In the case of blockchain, US 
companies invested $2 billion in 2020, compared with $800 million from EU companies. US 
private investment in cybersecurity was $42 billion versus the EU’s $370 million in 2020.168 

US players dominate this field. Seventy percent of the top blockchain technology players are 
US companies (JP Morgan, Linux, IBM, Coinbase, Accenture, Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs); 
20 percent are in Europe (Ethereum, Swift). The United States also has 70 percent of the top 
players in the cybersecurity software space: Cisco, Akamai, Forcepoint, Palo Alto Networks, 
Illumio, Okta, Unisys.169 Others are in Australia and Canada. 

Adoption 
The United States leads in government funding of blockchain, which totaled nearly $3 billion 
in 2021. The EU figure was $2 billion, and the China figure $1 billion.170 Corporations in 
China and the United States also lead on adoption of blockchain technologies. In 2021, 
64 percent of the top 100 US companies had implemented blockchain; in China, the share was 
57 percent, and in the EU 33 percent.171 

8. The Bio Revolution

Advances in biological sciences and the accelerating development of computing, automation, 
AI, and data analysis have coincided to fuel a wave of biological innovation that MGI 
has characterized as the Bio Revolution. This is a broad landscape of innovation across 
technologies and domains. MGI focused on four areas: biomolecules, or the mapping, 
measuring, and engineering of molecules; biosystems, the engineering of cells, tissues, and 
organs; biomachines, the interface between biology and machines; and biocomputing, or the 
use of cells or molecules such as DNA for computation. 

We estimate that gross value added of €300 billion to €500 billion could be generated by this 
group of transversal technologies in 2040. 

Europe trails with a factor of 0.6 across the three stages, scoring broadly on par on innovation 
with 0.8, but lagging behind on production (0.4) and adoption (0.5). 

Why does this transversal technology matter?
The Bio Revolution is a growing and already broad area of innovative technology. MGI 
cataloged a pipeline of about 400 visible use cases in multiple industries, almost all of which 
are scientifically feasible today. These applications alone could have direct annual global 
economic impact of $2 trillion to $4 trillion over the next ten to 20 years. More than half of 
the direct impact of the applications is likely to be outside health, primarily in agriculture 
and consumer products. The economic impact of biomolecules and biosystems accounts 
for about 95 percent of the estimated total impact—between $1.7 trillion and $3.4 trillion. 
Biomachines account for about 5 percent at $100 billion to $200 billion, and biocomputing, a 
growing if nascent area, less than 1 percent of the total.172 

Considering potential knock-on effects, new applications yet to emerge, and additional 
scientific breakthroughs, the full potential could be far larger. To give a sense of the potential 
scale, as much as 60 percent of today’s physical inputs to the global economy are either

global disease burden could be addressed using science that is conceivable today.173

While European academics are prolific, the United States leads on innovation, with China 
catching up 
Europe led on research publications with twice the volume of the United States and three 
times the number from China between 2018 and 2020. However, the United States filed more 
patents than either of the other regions and invested more in early-stage funding—$29 billion 
during this period, compared with $6.4 billion for China and $6.2 billion for Europe. Europe 
has only one company in the world’s biotech top ten. US companies originated twice as many 
of the therapeutics approved between 2018 and 2020 as European companies. China is 
catching up rapidly on all dimensions (Exhibit 48).174

Innovation
In 2021, European institutions had a convincing lead in the number of pharmaceutical-related 
scientific publications, with 736,000, more than the United States and China combined.175 On 
the top 50 percent of publications—an indicator of high-quality research—Europe matched 
the United States from 2014 to 2017 (with 243,000 and 242,000, respectively). China was 
behind, with 95,000, but its tally grew quickly, at a 33 percent rate, between 2011–15 and 
2014–17.176 

The United States filed some 50,000 biotech patents between 2015 and 2020, followed by 
Europe with about 40,000 and China with about 39,000. In 2021, China had the most biotech 
patents granted, with about 23,500, a dramatic increase from just 8,000 in 2020. Meanwhile, 
the United States had 11,900 biotech patents granted, and Europe had nearly 5,500 in 2021.177 

Finally, between 2018 and 2020, the United States led on total early-stage funding with 
$29 billion, compared with China and Europe at $6.4 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.178 
The gap in early-stage biotech funding between Europe and the United States is widening, 
while China has been catching up with Europe. Between 2015–17 and 2018–20, Europe’s 
funding grew by 13 percent per year, compared with 17 percent for the United States and 
18 percent for China.179

Production
Half of the world’s top 25 biotech companies in 2022 in market capitalization are based in 
the United States. Europe is home to five, including the Danish company Novo Nordisk, the 
world’s number one. China had three players in the top 25 in 2022.180 

Regarding the next generation of biotech, the United States was home to 65 percent of all 
newly founded biotech companies between 2018 and 2020, compared with 24 percent for 
Europe and 12 percent for China.181 Between 2015–17 and 2018–20, China’s share rose from 
8 percent to 12 percent.182 While China’s manufacturing leadership lies in non-tech-intensive 
segments such as generic drugs and biosimilars, it has demonstrated innovative leadership 
in certain technologies. For instance, Nanjing Legend Biotech emerged as the leader in 
CAR T-cell therapies in 2017.183 In partnership with Johnson & Johnson, the company secured 
approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2022.184

Adoption
The majority of new biotech therapies approved between 2018 and 2020 originated from US 
companies. In that period, US companies achieved about 30 FDA and European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) approvals, versus 15 for European companies.185 Although many more biotechs 
are listed in China, their global presence so far is limited. In 2020, Chinese biotech companies 
had had only four drugs approved by the FDA and the EMA.186

of around $9 billion annually. Europe’s public funding from both the EU and its constituent 
countries comes to about $5 billion a year. China’s annual public spending is estimated at 
about $2 billion per year.187

9. Next-generation materials

Next-generation materials refers to major innovations in the properties, manufacturing 
processes, and market applications of metals, polymers, ceramics, composites, and 
coatings. Innovations in materials can occur on different scales. They can, for instance, 
include improved structural properties at the nanometer scale, novel surface geometries 
at the micrometer scale, and creation of new materials markets and applications at a global 
scale.188 In this report, we chose to focus on three categories of next-generation materials 
that have significant impact on several industries and innovate in physical and environmental 
performance. Overall, this technology could generate gross value added of about €70 billion 
by 2040. 

Europe leads on some metrics in next-generation materials overall, with a factor of 1.3. It leads 
in production, with a factor of 2.0, and in adoption, with a factor of 1.2, while lagging behind the 
United States on some metrics of innovation, with a factor of 0.7. 

Why does this transversal technology matter? 
Materials design and the invention of new materials have very broad impact across sectors, 
from transportation to health and renewable energy. They can change the economics of 
a wide range of products and services by being more efficient and potentially cheaper to 
produce from a total-cost-of-ownership standpoint. Future construction materials will enable 
the reduction of the sector’s carbon footprint. 

We focus on these three large subsegments of next-generation materials: 

 — Nanomaterials. Nanotechnology includes carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles, graphene, 

titanium dioxide, and other new materials. Applications are relevant to cleantech, 
aerospace, and medical technology, among other sectors. This segment was valued at 
nearly $2 billion in 2020, and that is expected to grow at a 35.5 percent compound annual 
rate from 2020 to 2026.189

 — Composites. These include fiber-reinforced polymers (for instance, glass and carbon), 
ceramic matrix composite, metal matrix composite, reinforced concrete, translucent 
concrete, engineered wood, plywood, engineered bamboo, wood-plastic composite, 
cement-bonded wood fiber, and syntactic foams.190 The largest of these segments, fiber-
reinforced polymers, was valued at an estimated $34 billion in 2020 and is expected 
to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4 percent from 2020 to 2024.191 When 
considering the next step in the value chain, including composite products, components, 
design, and tooling services, the market reached a value of $78 billion in 2020, and it is 
expected to grow at 9 percent per year to 2025.192 

 — Future construction materials. Responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, the construction industry faces a major decarbonization challenge. 
Concrete is the largest contributor, accounting for about 4.5 percent of global GHG and 
7 percent of CO2 emissions in 2019. Reducing its environmental footprint can be achieved 
via several avenues, including redesigning with alternative building materials, such as 
cross-laminated timber (CLT), and reducing emissions per unit of building material by

concrete—green cement. 193 The global green cement market was estimated to be valued 
at $22 billion to $27 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow between 8 and 13 percent per 
year in the next five to 10 years.194 While relatively nascent, the CLT market is estimated to 
have been $1.1 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow by 14.5 percent per year to 2027. 

Nanomaterials: The United States leads on most indicators, but Europe is strong on 
funding and patents
Europe and the United States each held about one-quarter of global world-class patents 
in 2019, and the two are approximately equal on venture capital spending and global 
nanomaterials suppliers. However, Europe leads in corporate investment and adoption; it was 
the largest end market in 2020 (Exhibit 49).

Innovation
Europe and the United States broadly match each other on patents, with more than 
25 percent of world-class patents in 2019. China is some way behind but because of Japan’s 
strong position, East Asia as a whole (excluding China) is on a par with Europe and the United 
States.195 Looking at venture capital investment from 2015 to 2020, the United States had a 
slight lead with about $1 billion, compared with Europe’s $900 million; both were far ahead 
of Asia (including China) with $518 million. However, this picture varies across subsegments. 
Europe has invested twice as much venture capital as the United States in graphene in recent 
years, for instance.196

Across all nanomaterial segments, Europe has slightly more global suppliers than the United 
States (108 versus 101); both are well ahead of China, which has 20 nanomaterials suppliers 
with global footprints.197 In the largest segment (carbon nanotubes), the United States has a 
greater number of global suppliers, while Europe has some of the world’s leaders, including 
Nanocyl, which produces multiwall carbon nanotubes, and OCSiAI, one of the largest 
single-wall carbon nanotube producers. Many European players are among the top global 
suppliers of graphene, including Directa Plus, Haydale Graphene, and Versarien. Europe also 
captured the largest share of corporate investment in nanomaterials from 2015 to 2020, with 
$594 million against the $148 million invested in the United States and $417 million in Asia 
(including China).198 

Adoption 
Europe accounted for 33 percent of global sales, compared with 22 percent for the United 
States and 23 percent for Asia (including China).199

Next-generation composites

While China is the largest end market for fiber-reinforced polymers, the United States, 
Europe, and Japan are the leaders in production. 

Composites have applications in many markets. Europe is a leading adopter in aerospace 
(because of the presence of Airbus and its supplier ecosystem) and in oil and gas. China 
leads in automotive, followed closely by Europe, where stringent emissions regulations have 
led manufacturers to shift to lighter-weight materials. China and Europe together lead in 
electronics. The United States leads in boatbuilding and marine, sports and recreation, civil 
infrastructure, construction, and utility infrastructure. The United States and Europe are on a 
par on industrial applications (Exhibit 50).200

Innovation
The United States was far in front in venture capital investment in carbon fiber startups, 
between 2015 and 2021 with $912 million and 156 deals. In that segment, Europe posted 
$149 million in funding across 108 deals, while China stood at $85 million and 29 deals.201 

Production
Europe and the United States are roughly even, with ten and nine top global suppliers of 
composites, respectively; China has five. However, the United States and China captured the 
largest shares of market in volume in the largest subsegments (glass fiber and carbon fiber). 
Europe’s strength in next-generation composites resides in its intermediate players operating 
in high-end applications and differentiating themselves from others through innovation rather 
than on price; examples include Gurit and Saertex. Looking beyond the three regions, Japan 
has a very strong position in next-generation composites (notably in carbon fiber) with global 
leaders Toray Industries, Teijin Limited, and Mitsubishi Rayon.

Adoption
China was the largest end market for fiber-reinforced polymers (especially carbon and glass, 
the largest segments of next-generation composites). It represented 27 percent of the global 
market in 2020, followed by the United States with 24 percent and Europe with 21 percent.202

McKinsey Global InstituteFuture construction materials
Europe matches the United States for innovative companies in construction materials 
overall. Looking at specific subsegments, Europe appears to lead in the production of both 
green cement and CLT courtesy of its large incumbents. Europe and the United States share 
leadership on adoption, depending on the market (Exhibit 51).

Innovation
Of the six companies leading innovation in construction materials, three are based in the 
United States and three in Europe.203 One of the most promising next-generation materials for 
construction is green cement. Startups active in this field are mostly US-based; they include 
Calera Corporation, Ceratech, and Solidia Technologies. However, Europe also has a strong 
presence, with companies such as Ecocem and Cenin.204 Broadly speaking, Europe appears 
to be ahead of the United States in next-generation construction materials, including green 
cement, with China third.

Production
Again thanks to its large incumbents, Europe leads in the production of green cement, 
with three companies in the top ten players in the market; the United States and China 
have one each.205 European players also have a strong position in the CLT industry, with 
production shares of between 60 and 65 percent.206 Global leader Stora Enso had 20 percent 
of the global market in 2020, and several large players are located in Austria, Germany, 
and Switzerland.207 

Adoption
North America remains the largest end market for green cement, with approximatively 35 to 
45 percent of market share in 2020. However, Europe is gaining ground significantly because 
of a supportive regulatory environment, tax reliefs, and other benefits.208 Europe holds about 
40 percent of the end-market share in CLT, while the United States has approximatively 
15 percent.209

The future of cleantech

Cleantech is an umbrella term for a wide range of technologies. It encompasses solar, wind, 
and hydro power, all of which are well established, as well as newer technologies that are 
breaking through, including fusion, next-generation energy storage, and hydrogen. In this 
section we focus on six technologies in the innovation stage (nuclear fusion; carbon capture, 
use, and storage [CCUS]; smart grids; next-generation batteries; long-duration energy 
storage [LDES]; and hydrogen) and six in the production stage (solar, wind, hydrogen, nuclear 
fission, hydropower, and energy storage).210 

This transversal technology could generate gross value added of up to €400 billion by 2040. 
Europe leads on innovation, lags on production, and is on a par with China on adoption; the 
average factor is 1.0. 

Why does this transversal technology matter? 
Clean technologies are sliding down the cost curve and becoming more disruptive to 
traditional business models. They are beginning to affect both the structure of industries 
and their competitive dynamics. These technologies will clearly have a significant impact 
on energy industries, the power sector, transportation, buildings and infrastructure, and 
other areas. 

In the EU, McKinsey has estimated that stakeholders will need to allocate an additional 
€5 trillion (an average of €180 billion a year) to clean technologies and techniques in order to 
transition to net zero and that doing so would ultimately lower operating costs. From 2021 to 
2050, the EU would save an average of €130 billion annually in total system operating costs, 
with most savings coming in transportation.211 

The global cleantech market was valued at $285 billion in 2020 and is forecast to expand 
to $425 billion in 2026.212 About 75 percent of global energy is expected to be produced by 
renewables by 2050.213

Europe’s head start in cleantech has started to wane
Europe was the clear cleantech pioneer between 1990 and 2010, but its lead subsequently 
began to diminish. 

Europe has the most ambitious emissions reduction targets; the EU has committed to 
reducing the region’s emissions by 55 percent by 2030.214 The region leads on patents and 
venture capital funding; it also uses the highest share of renewables in its overall energy mix. 
Yet China now dominates cleantech production in nearly all areas, often with market shares 
of more than 50 percent. On innovation, the United States is generating more breakthrough 
technologies (Exhibit 52).

commercial CCUS projects 
operating in United States 
in 2021 vs 3 each in Europe 
and China

On venture capital investment, Europe has historically lagged behind the United States but 
has recently reversed that trend. Between 2013 and 2019, $60 billion was invested globally 
in cleantech startups. Of that, $29 billion went to the United States and Canada, $20 billion to 
China, and $7 billion (or 12 percent of the total) to Europe.216 However, Europe outpaced China 
and the United States in 2020, with $6.2 billion of venture capital investment in cleantech.217 
Europe’s stronger venture capital investment showing appeared to be set to continue, with 
$7 billion committed as of June 2021. In 2020, public R&D investment in Europe in cleantech 
reached $10.4 billion, while the United States invested $8.2 billion.218 

The United States has a clear lead on several metrics for breakthrough technologies, 
specifically on six key technologies: nuclear fusion, CCUS, smart grids, next-generation 
batteries, LDES, and hydrogen. Europe, however, leads on green hydrogen (just 
behind Japan).219

 — Nuclear fusion. Of 23 companies showcased by the Fusion Industry Association in 2021, 
13 are in the United States, seven in Europe, and one in China. In recent years, about 
$2.4 billion of funding went to private companies, with private funding representing nearly 
95 percent of the total. Of this, 80 percent went to the top four companies, all of which are 
based in the United States.220 

 — CCUS. In 2021, the United States had 14 commercial CCUS projects in operation, and 
Europe and China three each.221 The high number in the United States is thanks to the 
US 45Q tax credit for carbon sequestration alongside complementary policies such as 
California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). The LCFS provides a credit of $50 per ton 
of CO2 that is permanently stored, and $35 per ton used in enhanced oil recovery or other 
beneficial uses for 12 years from the commencement of operation of the project. Looking 
ahead, European countries are now more heavily investing in infrastructure, with 35 
commercial CCUS projects as of 2021. In comparison, the United States has 56 projects, 
and China has three. 

 — Smart grids. Looking at the top 20 players in total patents filed, the United States 

accounts for 3,200 patents, a share of 44 percent. China has 1,200 patents, or 22 percent 
of the total, and Europe has 850 patents, or 12 percent. US-based Qualcomm leads 
patenting in this area with 2,500 patents, or 34 percent of the global total.222

 — Next-generation batteries. Looking at the top 50 innovative companies in funding 
since creation, the United States is far ahead, with $19.1 billion investment and 26 
companies. Europe has about one-third of these figures, with $7.0 billion investment and 
17 companies.223 China is lower still, with about $3.0 billion.224 However, funding is highly 
concentrated in the largest battery manufacturers. Europe’s major player, Northvolt, had 
accumulated investment of $6.5 billion as of May 2022 by developing the world’s first low-
carbon battery at scale.225

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gap — LDES. The first two unicorns in this field are US companies: ESS Inc. and Form Energy. 
Their market capitalization is already ten times that of their European counterparts.226 A 
gravity storage US startup, Energy Vault, was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and 
had already attained unicorn status as of early 2022.227 However, European startups have 
strengthened their presence on the LDES Council launched at the COP26 climate summit 
in fall 2021. Currently, 16 European startups are taking part in the council, up from only six 
at its inception. In North America, 11 startups are part of the LDES Council, compared with 
nine in 2021.

 — Hydrogen. Between 2019 and mid-2021, Europe attracted 46 percent of global early-
stage venture capital for hydrogen-related startups, compared with 36 percent for the 
United States.

Production 
Europe leads in hydrogen production and is second to China in production of the other most 
important cleantech categories. China is also the major producer of the raw materials required 
in the cleantech supply chain. Looking in turn at the major cleantech categories: 

 — Solar. China has seven of the ten leading module players in solar manufacturing.228 China 

built 70 percent of the world’s solar photovoltaics in 2019.229 Seven Chinese manufacturers 
account for more than three-quarters of the revenue of the top ten players.230

 — Wind. Of the top ten wind power manufacturers in 2020, six were Chinese, three 

European, and one based in the United States. Looking at the total installed capacity of 
those players, China accounted for 46 percent, Europe 40 percent, and the United States 
14 percent.231 China represents 57 percent of the revenue of the top ten players, and 
Europe 43 percent.232 China started to overtake Europe on wind power manufacturing by 
the end of 2015.233

 — Hydrogen. Europe has three of the top seven H2 players. The top manufacturers are 

Linde Group (Europe), Air Liquide (Europe), Air Products (United States), Air Water (Japan), 
Taiyo Nippon Sanso (Japan), Messer Group (Europe), and Yingde Gases (China). The 
market is highly fragmented, with the top five manufacturers holding only a 5 percent 
share of the market.234 

 — Nuclear fission. While there are debates on whether nuclear fission is categorized 
within cleantech, as of February 2022, the EU Commission approved in principle 
a Complementary Climate Delegated Act including, under strict conditions, specific 
nuclear and gas energy activities in the list of economic activities covered by the 
EU taxonomy. 235 The United States accounted for 42 percent of the revenue of the top ten 
players in 2020. China had 26 percent, and Europe less than 5 percent.236

 — Hydropower. Europe and the United States each have three of the world’s top 

ten manufacturers.237

 — Energy storage (batteries). In 2019, China produced 73 percent of the worlds lithium-ion 
batteries, the United States 10 percent, and Europe 6 percent. But Europe’s aggressive 
investment and policies could boost its position. Forecasts for 2029 suggest that Europe 
could capture 16 percent of production, while China is seen as continuing to dominate 
with 70 percent, and the United States maintaining a share of 9 percent. Between April

of installed electricity from 
renewables in Europe vs  
41% in China and  
25% in the United States

2019 and April 2020, China installed 46 new mega factories, Europe installed six, and the 
United States four. China accounts for more than 80 percent of some steps of the battery 
manufacturing process.238 

Besides manufacturing, China has sprinted ahead of the US and Europe to dominate other 
key links of the cleantech supply chain, including raw materials and energy storage. China 
accounts for large shares of several key inputs needed for solar panels, batteries, and 
other green tech, including chemical lithium (50 percent of global production), polysilicon 
(60 percent), rare earth metals (70 percent), natural graphite (70 percent), cobalt refining 
(80 percent), and rare earths refining (90 percent). The United States imports 40 percent 
of its lithium, 80 percent of its cobalt, and 100 percent of its graphite.239 In Europe, 70 to 
80 percent of the nickel, lithium, and cobalt required for batteries and electrical installations is 
imported.240 Through the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II), Europe aims to have renewable 
energy increase to 32 percent in its energy mix by 2030; it may need to increase imports of 
these composites to achieve that goal.241

Adoption 
Europe had the highest share of renewables in its overall energy mix in 2020, with 50 percent 
of its installed electricity capacity coming from renewables; China’s share was 41 percent, 
and the US share was 25 percent. In total electricity produced, China leads with 1.7 terawatt-
hours, with Europe at 1.2, and the United States at 0.6. In per capita terms, Europe had 
2.3 gigawatt-hours per million while China had 1.2.242 

Looking at public and private capital expenditures on the deployment of low-carbon 
technology, Europe led in 2020 by investing $166 billion into the energy transition (that 
is, renewables, energy storage, electric vehicles and heating, hydrogen, and carbon 
capture and storage). China was second with $135 billion, and the United States third with 
$85 billion. Within Europe, the top five countries on private and public investment are 
Germany ($39 billion), the United Kingdom ($26 billion), France ($20 billion), the Netherlands 
($19 billion), and Spain ($13 billion).243 Looking at the individual types of cleantech: 

 — Solar. In 2020, China had the highest installed capacity, with 34 percent of the world’s 
solar PV capacity, having added 50 gigawatts in 2019. Europe had 24 percent, and the 
United States 11 percent. Europe leads on installed capacity per capita, with 295 watts per 
capita, versus 147 watts in China.244

 — Wind. In 2020, China had the highest installed capacity, with 38 percent of the global 

total, and it is adding 20 gigawatts a year. Europe had 28 percent, and the United States 
19 percent.245

 — Hydro. In 2020, China had 28 percent of global capacity installed, Europe 17 percent, and 

the United States 8 percent.246

 — Nuclear. In 2020, Europe led with 117 gigawatts (of which 61 gigawatts were in France), 
which was 29 percent of the world’s total installed capacity. The United States had 96 
gigawatts installed or 24 percent of the total, and China 50 gigawatts or 13 percent.247 

 — Electric vehicles. Until recently, China had the largest EV market, with 1.2 million vehicles 

out of the global total of 2.3 million, and vehicles were largely supplied by domestic 
players. However, Europe caught up and moved marginally ahead of China in 2020; its EV

Europe’s lagging position on all but two out of the ten transversal technologies identified as 
being pivotal for performance across sectors leaves companies competitively vulnerable—
even in sectors in which the region has traditionally had strongholds. In the next chapter, we 
look at some potential ideas that European political, regulatory, and business decision makers 
might consider in order to enable corporations in the region to up their scale and speed and 
thereby level the playing field with their counterparts in other major economies.

5. A range of 

impediments stand in 
the way of progress

Europe needs to address a range of impediments that may prevent it from competing in the 
face of increasing disruption and winner-takes-most dynamics. They include broad and 
complex issues such as inflexible labor markets, lagging digital infrastructure, and a suboptimal 
environment for attracting tech and entrepreneurial talent, among others. From a wide range 
of challenges, four stand out: fragmentation leading to lack of scale, a lack of established 
technology ecosystems, less developed risk-capital funding, and a regulatory environment that 
could be more supportive of disruption and innovation (Exhibit 53). 

These four impediments feed through to others, overall making Europe a less appealing 
environment to start new companies and attract tech and entrepreneurial talent. Fragmentation 
and a lack of scale-up capital compromise European companies’ operations. A relative lack of 
developed and dynamic tech ecosystems contributes to the absence of a level playing field for 
European corporates. Regulation needs to be tailored in such a way as enabled rapid decision 
making, agility, and innovation. Other impediments seem to be consequences of these four 
rather than root causes. Take entrepreneurial talent as an example. If Europe were to fix its 
scale, venture capital, and ecosystems gaps as well as the regulatory approach, there is a high 
chance that this talent would seek and find opportunities in Europe rather than elsewhere. All the 
impediments that we look at in this chapter reinforce one another. For instance, if venture capital 
is insufficient, it is less likely that ecosystems can develop, and vice versa.253

scale because of fragmentation. The EU alone has 27 countries with 24 official languages, 
and differences in laws and regulations (although they are converging), culture, consumer 
behavior, and even distribution and marketing channels among them. Consider that a 
European startup can address a market similar to the size of the continental United States 
only by accessing all 27 member countries that belong to the Single Market—but an 
incomplete Single Market with a range of regulatory approaches (Exhibit 54). Companies 
scaling up in Europe cite a lack of regulatory harmonization as the second most important 
barrier for growth.254 

The fragmented European value pool means that the region’s startups are forced to 
internationalize earlier in their journey—with all the effort that entails. About 70 percent of 
European unicorns have established a global or partly global geographic footprint to reach 
unicorn status, compared with 50 percent of US unicorns.255 In itself, early internationalization 
is positive; what is less positive is that European companies are scaling more slowly and often 
in the United States before they return to Europe.

create large, integrated data sets for training AI models.256 In the United States, the collection 
and management of data are concentrated in a few big technology companies. The scale 
of China’s technology ecosystem is anchored on tech giants such as Alibaba, Baidu, and 
Tencent, and the fact that more than 70 percent of Chinese consumers are omnichannel 
shoppers who generate an explosion of consumer data. According to Ericsson estimates, 
China’s data traffic may grow by 25 percent per year between 2021 and 2027, enabling it 
to maintain its position as the world’s largest source of consumer data.257 Chinese citizens 
shared more data than those in those in other countries—45 percent versus 25 to 35 percent 
in the United States and Western Europe, according to one survey—if that means they obtain 
choice, tailored products and services, and higher quality.258 The availability and scale of data 
sets are essential for training AI systems where products and services are rapidly moving 
from pattern recognition and insight generation to more sophisticated forecasting techniques 
requiring extensive databases.259

In the case of trust architecture, cybersecurity governance models differ among EU member 
states, and even within them, the responsibility for cybersecurity is often divided among many 
entities. These differences may make cooperation in responding to cross-border incidents 
and exchanging intelligence on potential threats more difficult even at the national level 
(let alone the European level).260 Analysis of national audit offices by the European Court of 
Auditors revealed that weaknesses in public authorities’ governance arrangements and risk 
management were perceived as the highest risks.261

As for the Bio Revolution, the fragmentation of the European market is a key challenge. The 
marked differences among countries’ healthcare systems create multiple paths to innovation 
and financing for companies.262 In funding, for instance, the pool of public and private capital 
for biological innovation is expanding in Europe, but Europe’s investor base is dispersed. 
Between 2018 and 2020, 47 percent of the early-stage venture funding raised by European 
biotech companies was from investors in their home country, compared with 25 percent from 
European investors outside of the home market, which is nearly on a par with the share of 
US investors (21 percent).263 The fact that so much of such funding is raised in local markets 
in Europe, and those local markets are, by definition, relatively small compared with, say, the 
entirety of the United States, goes some way to explain Europe’s scale-up funding gap. 

Lack of established technology ecosystems

Technology ecosystems matter for several reasons. First, much innovation is now 
concentrated in digital, and the presence of large firms with large data sets and a larger 
network of users is needed to roll out innovation rapidly. Notably, examining the top ten tech 
companies in each of the United States and Europe by spending on R&D, the US top ten 
spends about four times the amount (Exhibit 55). 

Second, there is a strong feedback loop: the most successful ecosystems and firms are 
those that attract an ever-greater share of global talent and capital, making them yet more 
successful. Third, a high share of founders has previously learned the ropes in the most 
successful large firms, and they bring some of the founding capital from the stock options 
they were given. 

Europe does have impressive ecosystems, including Germany’s Mittelstand, the Paris-
Region competitiveness cluster, and the pharma-biotech Golden Triangle between London, 
Oxford, and Cambridge. However, Europe is far from matching the United States and other

wave technological companies, with only 37 “decacorns” (private venture-backed companies 
valued at more than $10 billion) as of July 2021. There are 134 in the United States. This 
disparity that may now turn into a disadvantage for Europe in future battlegrounds.264 Europe 
has no cluster at the level of China’s Shenzhen or, in the United States, Silicon Valley and the 
cluster around Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, home to the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology. According to a ranking of the world’s largest clusters of inventive activity based 
on patent filings, Paris is the only European center in the top ten, ranked tenth.265 

Yet because of path dependency, a gap in technologically capable firms and ecosystems will 
now make it harder to keep pace in the future. 

In the case of trust architecture, for instance, Europe’s lagging position on 5G, and its 
dependence on China for 5G infrastructure, leaves it vulnerable. These shortcomings in 
connectivity affect Europe’s global public cloud market and data control. In 2020, the top five 
IaaS providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, Google, and Huawei) accounted for 80 percent of 
the cloud market, which is valued at $64 billion.266 

Fifty-six percent of global private corporate investment in AI ($24 billion) was in the United 
States, largely accounted for by a few US tech giants.267 Europe’s lack of tech companies 
of comparable scale explains why it lags on AI funding. The EU, the European Investment 
Fund, and the European Investment Bank are launching new investments to support AI in 
the EU, but these efforts may not be sufficient to overcome path dependency and relatively 
weak ecosystems.

Path dependency is also relevant in next-generation computing and the future of 
programming. On the first, a large share of private investment is taking place in-house at large 
US tech giants with funding totaling $1 billion, four times that in Europe.

Less developed risk-capital funding

Europe has a more conservative capital market structure and a lack of angel investor money 
from successful founders that links back to its lack of established technology ecosystems. 
European firms thus have less ample access to risk capital and venture capital. Historically, 
Europe has devoted much less to venture capital funding than the United States—3.4 times 
less in 2019 and 2.8 times less in 2021. In 2021, Crunchbase data show, the United States 
attracted 47 percent of global venture capital funds invested, Europe 17 percent, and China 
12 percent. However, the gap between Europe and the United States narrowed to 2.8 times in 
2021. Europe remained ahead of China. In 2021 in the United States, venture capital funding 
totaled $300 billion. China’s figure was $131 billion and Europe’s $103 billion (for the EU-27, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).268

 — Late to the game. While the first US venture capital firm was established in 1946, Europe 

did not enter the venture capital sector until the 1990s. 

 — Less government support. Academic research has found a positive correlation between 
public venture capital and private capital investment.269 Historically, the total number and 
average annual budget of distinct equity entrepreneurial finance policies in Europe was 
on a par with those of the United States.270 Yet the United States has invested largely in 
early-stage applied research projects in other financing schemes, notably though the US 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which funded the research that 
created, for instance, the internet and the microchip.271 Public support for venture projects 
and capital has started ramping up in Europe through the 2018 Venture EU megafund and 
a range of innovation programs, but these efforts still need to scale up to match current 
investment needs. 

 — More active US stock market. The United States has a more active stock market, and 

this enables and encourages US venture capital activity. Indeed, many European startups 
look to international investors for their late-stage funding rounds and go to the US market. 
Ninety-five percent of all deals of $250 million and above involve US or Asian investors.

 — Regulatory environment. Across Europe (except for Sweden), current regulation has a 

high bar for pension funds to invest in illiquid alternative assets. Pension funds account for 
an annual average 8 percent of total venture capital fundraising in Europe, compared with 
20 percent in the United States. European pension funds have $3 trillion in assets under 
management but less than 0.02 percent invested, so there is potential for any increase to 
have a large impact. Europe also lacks the large university endowments that commonly 
invest in new ventures in the United States. The lack of depth in capital markets has an 
impact on Europe’s progress on the Bio Revolution. McKinsey’s Biotech Innovation Index 
shows that Europe’s main challenge is to transform its research powerhouses into newly 
funded biotechs.272 This also reflects a lack of funding—early stage, total, IPOs, and mutual 
funds. Early-stage funding has been growing but is still materially below the levels in the 
United States and China, and the gap is widening. Total funding is lower for EU biotechs 
than for their US and Chinese counterparts, although Europe is catching up, with series 
E rounds and average value of large (more than $100 million) late-stage funding similar to 
those in both other regions. Similarly, the mean IPO size for EU biotechs was four to five 
times larger on US exchanges than on European exchanges. Investment funds in Europe 
are maturing, but they still lag behind those in the United States. The three largest biotech 
funds in the United States are twice as large as their European counterparts. 

Regulatory environment and disruptive innovation

Despite an abundance of anecdotes about EU overregulation, from the curvature of bananas 
to flying empty planes to maintain airport slots, the Single Market has been an extremely 
successful driver of smarter regulation and competition, in particular product-market 
regulation. There, Europe scores higher on the OECD index than the United States and China, 
with a score of 1.4 versus 1.7 and 3.0 (where 0 is high and 6 is low), respectively. Also, against 
conventional wisdom, the degree of precaution in US and European risk regulation is similar.273 

In some instances, however, the EU is more precautionary—and slower—in its approach than 
the United States.

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gap — Autonomous vehicles. Since 2018, China has established standards to authorize L4 test 
AVs to circulate. Beijing and Shenzhen have authorized L4 autonomous taxi services. In 
the United States, California approved circulation of test AVs. Waymo, based in Silicon 
Valley, is the leading L4 AV player by kilometers tested, with close to 55 percent of the 
global total. In Europe, regionwide common legislation on L4 AVs is absent. Germany and 
the United Kingdom are closest to putting legislation forward to allow L4 AVs only in very 
restricted test areas and under strict conditions. 

 — Blockchain. China was the first major region to take proactive steps toward blockchain 
regulation, with the aim of being the world leader. In 2016, its Ministry of Industry and 
Information Technology led the preparation of a legal policy research report on blockchain 
in finance. EU regulation is being planned but has not yet been ratified. In March 2022, 
the European Parliament decided to enter into negotiations with EU governments on the 
final shape of a bill formalizing new rules.274 In the United States, the president issued an 
executive order in March 2022 that requires various government agencies to produce 
papers on a range of regulatory questions as a stepping-stone toward regulation.275 
Regulation needs to be smart to be effective. The US regulatory framework on 
cryptocurrencies has striven to find a balance between policy objectives such as financial 
stability and consumer protection and enabling innovation. 

 — Biotech. In 2015, the European Commission gave EU member states the ability to opt 

out of growing genetically modified food products; 19 out of the (then) 27 member states 
chose to ban them, while they are widespread in other countries.276 Measured by land 
used, the leading producers are the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Canada.277 
Approaches to the sharing of genomic data differ, too. The EU’s General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) has special provisions for the careful guarding of such data. The United 
States treats genomic data in the same way as health data.278 The EU also takes a more 
precautionary approach than the United States to regulation of alien invasive species.279 
In turn, the EU was the first region in the world to define a policy and legal framework for 
the approval of biosimilar medicines; the first biosimilar was approved in 2006, nearly a 
decade before the first one was approved in the United States.280 

 — Distributed infrastructure. Europe’s lagging position on adoption may reflect relatively 
tight regulation of data security and privacy in the region, among other factors, including 
decreasing the speed of integration of services, especially in banking and healthcare.281 
Europe’s regulation may hinder companies’ adoption of cloud and edge services as a 
significant part of their IT infrastructure. This may limit the ability of local players to scale 
quickly and to compete with market leaders. 

 — Applied AI. A European Digital Single Market has yet to be fully developed and Europe 

has chosen to have stronger rules to protect privacy, including the GDPR. In a 2020 survey 
conducted by the European Commission, firms in the EU said that a lack of internal data 
and insufficient access to public and private data sets stood in the way of their adoption of 
AI.282 AI, machine learning, and deep learning tools such as recommendation engines and 
search algorithms need extensive data pools. The data issue therefore also has an impact 
on the future of programming.

McKinsey Global InstituteOverall, the EU’s score on the ability of the legal framework to adapt to digital business 
models—as compiled by the World Economic Forum—is below that of the United States 
(Exhibit 57).283 

Labor market flexibility

The EU’s score on the business friendliness of labor-market regulation is 20 percent lower 
than that of the United States and 35 percent below China’s. This is important in a period 
of accelerated automation and technological disruption, which implies the need for very 
large-scale reskilling and labor reallocation across activities and firms. Labor market 
rules may benefit from being reviewed to ensure that they can support faster reallocation 
where appropriate. Flexicurity principles that protect workers and people rather than jobs, 
spearheaded by Denmark and now adopted in parts of Europe, are preferable to regulations 
centered on higher employment protection in the period of disruption ahead.

Despite the strength of Europe’s education systems, including its robust science base, 
translation of scientific research into commercial opportunities is relatively slow in Europe.284 
The EU has less basic-school entrepreneurial education and training than either China 
or the United States, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. There are also 
many instances of effective collaboration between companies and academia in Europe. 
Nevertheless, there is less translation of university research into commercial applications 
and less entrepreneurism. One metric worth noting is that 12 percent of company founders 
in Europe have a PhD; it is 31 percent in the United States. EU startups tend to be run 
by academics with less industry experience than their US counterparts.285 R&D in next-
generation materials is lower in Europe than in other major regions, and there is less 
collaboration between universities and the private sector. 

In the European biotech sector, as with other technologies, the translation of scientific 
research into commercial opportunities has tended to be slower and less extensive than 
in other major economies, partly reflecting the fact that much of the funding for academic 
research tends to be independent of how the research is applied in the market. Furthermore, 
academic regulations in Europe pertaining to academics taking equity stakes in companies, 
for instance, can be restrictive than in the United States.286 To bridge this gap, tech transfer 
offices and technology licensing offices have been established at most top European 
research institutes and universities, but they remain small. According to the European Patent 
Office, more than half of them have ten or fewer employees, and only one to three employees 
who deal with patent commercialization.287

Public innovation procurement and basic R&D

$124b

public R&D investment 
in Europe in 2020 
vs $144 billion in the 
United States and  
$55 billion in China

Basic research is the foundation for success in many horizontal industries. Europe still has 
strength here, but its position is weakening. In 2020, Europe invested $124 billion in public 
R&D, while China invested $55 billion and $144 billion was invested in the United States. 
Europe’s investment is highly fragmented across member states.288 Europe has relatively 
limited R&D funding from external sources such as state-funded private initiatives, examples 
being DARPA and the National Institutes of Health. Defense spending, so often a catalyst 
to broader innovation, has a role to play. The US government spends seven times more on 
defense R&D than Europe. Europe’s public R&D spending stands at about 0.7 percent of GDP, 
on a par with the United States. 

Moreover, Europe’s academic research ecosystem is challenged by the increasing migration 
of its human capital to the United States and Japan, for instance. Among several factors 
explaining this phenomenon, the appeal for outside-EU academic institutions is the superior 
financial rewards. Average salaries of EU researchers were 37 percent lower than those in 
the United States.289 Beyond remuneration, other factors behind the brain drain from Europe 
to other geographies include short-term fixed contracts for researchers early in their careers 
and attractive migration policies.290

McKinsey Global InstituteThe environment for attracting tech and entrepreneurial talent

Europe’s ability to attract the right talent to innovate is constrained by several factors, 
including the fact that it has fewer successful scale-up companies that offer high pay, a 
lack of stock options that act as an incentive for people with high skills as well as difficulties 
in using them, and immigration policies that do not focus on attracting outside tech talent 
and entrepreneurs. 

Europe has about the same number of STEM graduates as the United States as a share 
of their respective populations—0.20 percent versus 0.19 percent. However, China has 
0.34 percent of the total population (2016 figures) (Exhibit 58).

go to Europe vs 60% to  
the United States

Moreover, Europe is not attracting the world’s immigrant inventors, drawing about 35 percent 
while the United States’ figure is 60 percent.291 A contributory factor is Europe’s more limited 
use of skills-based immigration—the number of highly skilled workers given EU “blue cards” 
in 2018 was nearly 80 percent lower than the number of people given employment-based 
immigrant visas each year in the United States. 

Risk-averse mindset

Academic literature and surveys suggest that EU firms and individuals are more risk averse 
in business than their counterparts in the United States. A 2021 McKinsey executive survey 
on the future of growth found that European firms were more risk averse than their US 
counterparts on four out of five aspects of risk aversion.292 The World Economic Forum found 
that European firms underperform their US counterparts on embracing disruptive ideas and 
that they have a weaker appetite for entrepreneurial risk than in either the United States 
or China.293 

The World Economic Forum also found that Europeans have less of an appetite for 
entrepreneurial risk than individuals in the United States or China. A European Central Bank 
report found that risk aversion in investment decisions is more prevalent in the eurozone than 
in the United States, where the share of households holding risky assets is more than double 
the share in the eurozone.294 In a similar vein, a Flash Eurobarometer survey conducted with 
Gallup in 2009 found that US respondents were more likely to prefer competition and taking 
risks than their European or Chinese counterparts.295 In the United States, 16 percent of adults 
are entrepreneurs; in Europe, the share is only 6 percent. In the United States, 39 percent of 
media portrayals of entrepreneurs is positive; in Germany, that applies to only 10 percent of 
such coverage. 

Turning to how risk aversion may be affecting Europe’s position in transversal technologies, 
take next-generation computing as an example. Quantum technologies are deep tech, 
requiring specialized investors who support technologies whose technical risk is higher than 
their market risk. The United States outweighs the top 100 deep-tech investors in numbers 
and size of available budgets for emerging opportunities.296 Given that predicted disruptions 
across industries through quantum computing may be almost a decade out, investors willing 
to support long-haul innovations with risk are required. The EU’s Horizon has created a fund 
solely for deep tech, some venture capital players believe public funding may come with more 
restrictions for startups than traditional venture capital investments. 

European players may also be less encouraged to take risks. Europe offers less “skin in the 
game” incentives such as stock option plans. Six times more employees in the United States 
have access to different forms of participation ownership than in the EU.297 One study of

CEOs have more equity, their companies are more likely to perform better.298

McKinsey Global InstituteDigital infrastructure

Europe lags behind both the United States and China on digital infrastructure, and this may 
have a negative impact on the productivity of firms.299 In the United States, 92 percent of the 
population had access to ultra-high-speed (100 megabits) broadband in 2019. China is almost 
on a par with the United States with a 90 percent share; Europe is at 67 percent. Between 
2012 and 2018, investment in telecommunications infrastructure was $4,955 per household 
in the United States, compared with $1,610 in Europe (comparative data for China are not 
available). In the fourth quarter of 2019, the United States had 64 5G base stations (low- and 
midband) per million people, China 86, and the EU eight. In the case of cloud, even within 
Europe US-based companies have 66 percent of the market, and European cloud providers 
control only 16 percent. Taking another metric, economies’ dependence on satellites for 
navigation, imaging, and telecommunications is increasing. In 2021, the United States had 
3,891 satellites in orbit, the EU 505, and China 490.300 Due to Europe’s legacy devices and 
systems, capital-intensive upgrades may be needed to utilize the full potential of next-level 
automation, enabling all devices, sensors, and machines to work as a unified system.301 

Europe faces several challenges to address if it is to progress on innovation and scaling. Many 
of these have long been recognized by decision makers in the region, and the EU, the United 
Kingdom, and others have been acting to address them and enable companies to build scale 
in key technologies. In the final chapter of this report, our attention turns to what decision 
makers in the public and private sectors might also consider to vault the region forward—and 
catch up with others.

6. Achieving scale, 

speed, and a level 
playing field

In a winner-takes-most world, European decision makers and companies will need to go 
after competitiveness and growth. The diagnostic offered in this report thus far suggests 
that European decision makers may now need to consider new stances and fresh trade-offs 
in order to propel corporate and tech performance forward with more scale and speed. As 
noted, Europe has many strengths that it can leverage, including high-quality education 
systems producing a large pool of STEM talent. Europe is also the most open and connected 
large economy, with the most sophisticated industrial fabric and supply chains. Moreover, 
there are signs of positive momentum on which to build, including indications that new 
company formation and venture capital investment are starting to pick up, and the fact that 
the continent has launched a flurry of initiatives designed to up Europe’s game on technology 
and innovation. 

As winner-takes-most dynamics spread, Europe needs to play at greater scale and speed, 
and level the playing field for its firms.

As the sources of competition and growth shift toward disruptive innovation and intangibles, a 
winner-takes-most dynamic emerges in which scale, speed, and established tech ecosystems 
are increasingly vital. A changing geopolitical landscape complicates and deepens 
the challenge. 

In this context, the challenges discussed in the previous chapter put Europe at a 
disadvantage (Exhibit 59). Four challenges stand out and mutually reinforce one another: 
market fragmentation and lack of economic scale; smaller and less established technology 
ecosystems and firms; less developed risk-capital and scale-up funding; and a complex and 
slow regulatory environment that could be more supportive of disruption and innovation. 
Other impediments seem to be consequences more than root causes of those four. Take 
entrepreneurial talent as an example. If Europe were to address its scale, venture capital, and 
ecosystems gaps and its regulatory approach, there is a high probability that entrepreneurs 
would seek and find opportunities in Europe rather than elsewhere.

for what needs to be done at the institutional level. Many initiatives are being designed 
and launched. In the EU, the €95 billion Horizon Europe program, the Smart Specialization 
initiative, and the Important Projects of Common European Interest framework are but a few 
recent examples.302 

Yet if Europe wants to address its corporate performance gap and avoid a potential slow-
motion crisis unfolding over the years ahead, it could usefully consider one question: does the 
collective total of all the initiatives under way and planned not only match the scale and impact 
of what leading regions are doing but exceed it, and therefore enable catch-up from today’s 
weaker position? 

The implication is not that Europe simply copies the recipes used by other regions, but 
that it ensures that it enables its firms to compete at scale and speed and on a more level 
playing field. 

To help European firms to compete, Europe could reevaluate trade-
offs on 11 policy and regulatory initiatives 

We identify 11 initiatives as a thought starter that could form part of an integrated package to 
change the rules of the game for European firms, overcoming current handicaps. They would 
enable firms to build scale and attract scale-up funding, operate at higher speed and with 
greater degrees of freedom, and level the playing field with other regions and established 
firms. Many of those have been the topic of long-running debates and suggested trade-offs, 
yet this diagnostic suggests revisiting the current stance on them. We invite comments and 
collaboration to advance these initial ideas.

Scale and scale-up funding 
In transversal technologies where scale of markets, firms, and investment matters, Europe 
could increase and pool its resources as well as support cross-border scale-up and 
consolidation. European decision makers are bringing forward many initiatives aimed at 
enabling corporations to build scale in key tech areas. Some of the most prominent are 
the following: 

 — Horizon Europe. This is the main European research funding program of €95 billion from 
2021 to 2027, or €14 billion a year. The previous program (Horizon 2020) had €80 billion 
in funding. For comparison, the annual federal R&D budget of the United States for 2021 
was $165 billion, or more than ten times larger. 

 — Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI). This framework allows for 
a combination of private funding, EU funds, and national funding (above the normal limits 
for state aid) for major cross-border infrastructure or innovation projects. For instance, 
the Battery IPCEI pooled about €3 billion of public funding plus more than €9 billion of 
private funding. As of 2022, only three innovation IPCEIs are in place—two covering the 
battery value chain, one covering microelectronics—but several more are being proposed 
on health, hydrogen, cloud computing, and semiconductors. This framework has been 
criticized for lack of broad-based participation by small and medium-size enterprises and 
small member states. Only France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden have participated in more 
than two IPCEIs.

302  See Horizon Europe, European Commission; What Is Smart Specialisation? European Commission; Important projects 
of common European interest (IPCE), European Commission; and Thierry Breton, “How a European Chips Act will put 
Europe back in the tech race,” European Commission, September 15, 2021. 

105

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gap — Chips Act. This legislation aims to mobilize €43 billion of public and private investment 
with the objective of having a 20 percent market share for Europe by 2030; only a small 
share is committed public funding. This initiative will promote R&D and production of chips 
in Europe with the aim of achieving meaningful scale. The US CHIPS and Science Act has 
a funding envelope of $52 billion, all public money. 

 — Scale-up Europe. President Emmanuel Macron of France launched this initiative in 

2021 in collaboration with the European Commission and other member states. The aim 
is for Europe to become home to ten tech giants, each valued at more than €100 billion, 
by 2030.303 The initiative centers on three areas of action: (1) funding the final stages 
of development of scale-ups to support the emergence of world-class businesses of 
the future with deep ties in Europe; (2) making Europe a magnet for tech talent; and (3) 
fostering the development of world-class European breakthrough innovation companies. 

 — Fund of funds. One major announcement in 2022 was the creation of a pan-European 
fund of funds dedicated to late-stage funding and scale-ups, with €3.5 billion of total 
initial funding.

 — JEDI (Joint European Disruptive Initiative). This nonprofit private effort to create a 

European DARPA has received informal approval from France and Germany and has an 
initial budget of €50 million to €100 million—much lower than its US counterpart, which 
had a budget of about $3.5 billion in 2021. 

Europe could further consider the following initiatives:

1. Develop a European corporate rule book or 28th regime for high-growth firms. 
Companies scaling up in Europe cite a lack of regulatory harmonization as the second most 
important barrier to growth. European startups must contend with the fact that Europe is not 
a single market but a collection of countries with their own languages, cultures, regulations, 
and governments; customer behavior varies, and distribution and marketing are more 
challenging. The fragmented European value pool means that the region’s startups need to 
deal with cross-border complexity earlier in their journey, and many use the US market to 
scale before returning to other parts of Europe. About 70 percent of European unicorns have 
established a global or partly global geographic footprint to reach unicorn status, compared 
with 50 percent of US unicorns.304 Within the Single Market, the streamlining of regulation 
has been progressing, but full harmonization of standards for taxes (including VAT or 
employee stock options), regulation, labor rules, and administrative processes would be all but 
impossible in short time frames. Europe could therefore develop an additional 28th regime (a 
pan-European regulatory entity alongside the 27 EU member states and affiliated countries) 
as a common standard on top of national ones and allow high-growth firms that opt in and 
comply to operate in all European countries.

106

McKinsey Global Institute2. Facilitate and encourage cross-border consolidation, including completing the 
Single Market, revisiting antitrust rules, and removing political obstacles. More scale 
also requires more cross-border consolidation of existing large firms—not only to create 
more global leaders but also to support the development of ecosystems of innovative 
B2B suppliers around them. Completing the Single Market could help. A recent survey of 
all European Roundtable of Industrialists members found that the completion rate of the 
Single Market is 75 percent.305 More integration is needed in energy, particularly renewables 
and hydrogen, including for instance harmonizing taxation, removing infrastructure 
bottlenecks, and improving cross-border grid capacity. For instance, BASF cannot fully use 
its own offshore wind energy because of grid bottlenecks and lacking interconnectors and 
surcharges on renewable energy. Finance is another area for attention. Work still needs to be 
done on accelerating progress toward a capital markets union and banking union. In digital, 
establishing common data standards to ease data sharing across the EU member states and 
developing a common EU framework for the IoT, AI, and the deployment of 6G are next steps. 
The CEO of Deutsche Telecom, for instance, has expressed regret that there is no European 
electronic identity (eID) scheme. Today, 14 member states offer national eID schemes, but 
users face obstacles when trying to access public services in another EU country; the rest 
do not use eID. Private eID wallets compete, and each one struggles to gain critical mass, 
leaving the lion’s share of the market to tech giants. The respective frameworks and proposals 
are in place, but the work now needs to be implemented.306 European decision makers 
should consider removing political barriers to consolidation of what are often considered 
“national champions.” Finally, more consolidation would mean revisiting concentration rules 
in individual member states for M&A in sectors where competition is truly global. The aim 
is not to raise concentration or reduce competition. Quite the contrary, the motivation is 
to move from fragmented national competition (as is, arguably, the case today in sectors 
like banking) to truly European and global competition (as is already largely the case in, for 
instance, automotive).

3. Build European basic research and scale-up capital, including a “European DARPA,” 
venture capital structures, and changes to pension institutions. Europe’s later-stage 
growth funding is only about one-tenth that of the United States. The average amount for 
series D and E rounds raised by European startups is about $1 billion; the average amount 
in the United States is between $10 billion and $15 billion.307 Moreover, organizations like 
DARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), and the National 
Institutes of Health provide several billions of dollars to hundreds of R&D programs for 
breakthrough technologies. Europe could consider building equivalent institutions, for 
instance further developing JEDI. In the United Kingdom, legislation creating a new Advanced 
Research and Invention Agency, with £800 million of funding over four years, was going 
through Parliament in spring 2022.308 Europe could also reduce restrictions and capital 
requirements to enable asset managers and pension funds to invest more in alternative asset 
classes like venture capital and private equity. As discussed in Chapter 5, European pension 
funds find it difficult to invest in illiquid, alternative assets because of regulatory restrictions, 
which could be addressed. Europe could go one step further and build pension institutions 
that can operate at the scale and level of sophistication of global leaders.309 Finally, it could 
do more to crowd in private venture capital, building on the initiative of the Venture Capital 
Funds-of-Funds under the auspices of VentureEU to create a public venture capital fund.310 
Venture capital funding is about one-third of the US level. The United States has double

lower volume of deals rather than ticket sizes. 

4. Pool more public procurement and R&D support among a coalition of the willing, 
including in defense and healthcare. Europe has strengths in basic research. It is home to 
43 percent of the world’s top 100 life sciences universities and 26 percent of the top 100 for 
computer science.311 Within the EU, there is considerable integration of scientific research 
with a web of collaborations across the region through the European Research Council. 
Moreover, the EU earmarks funds to help less prosperous countries within Europe to build up 
their research infrastructure.312 Yet, as noted in chapter 5, there is still a brain drain to other 
countries and regions. Moreover, Europe pools only 0.2 percent of its total public procurement 
at the European level, compared with 45 percent at the federal level in the United States. In 
particular, the United States spends four times the combined budget of European states on 
defense and space, although it is noteworthy that in February 2022, Germany announced 
€100 billion of additional spending in 2022 to modernize the military in response to Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine; this funding is a national initiative and not an example of pooled public 
procurement.313 Similarly, the US federal government spends four times more on public R&D 
than is spent at the EU level. For instance, in the case of semiconductors, European states 
have in the past devoted only a few billion dollars in investment in a fragmented way, but 
in a welcome move in February 2022, the EU announced new EU-level funding of nearly 
€50 billion by 2030, much closer to US funding of $52 billion.314 Moving to joint procurement in 
innovation-related areas, from defense to healthcare to education technology, would allow for 
larger bets, permit a more regional focus, and help build an environment for scaling up leading 
European firms in those areas. The most obvious example is defense. However, innovation 
and pre-commercial procurement in other large-spending areas like medical and educational 
technology and supplies, or construction systems and materials, could be pooled. Joint 
procurement of broader healthcare or education services could also dramatically reshape 
those sectors, but this would require major reforms. Pre-commercial procurement and 
procurement of innovative solutions instruments exist but are not used at scale. At the same 
time, European leaders could consider increasing compensation schemes for lagging regions. 

5.  Increase development and crisis support to European regions in need. EU structural 
funds and the Recovery and Resilience Facility are widely respected. Yet US intrastate 
fiscal transfers are four times greater than transfers within the EU. Enhanced support for 
economically less developed parts of Europe could help them reach their full potential and 
usefully extend and consolidate the inner market—so long as effective governance could 
be put in place, both locally and at the European level. This would include both monetary 
transfers and support for economic development.

McKinsey Global InstituteSpeed and simplicity
Europe could balance its precautionary principle and consensus among member states with 
accelerated decision making and failure tolerance. European regulators have shown that 
they can become more agile. In response to the need for a rapid reaction to the pandemic, the 
European Medicines Agency significantly sped up its authorization for COVID-19 vaccines 
from anywhere between one and two years to only six months. This speed could now be 
applied to a broad range of innovation-related areas, along with the following measures: 

6. Rebalance the regulatory approach from a precautionary consumer-protection 
imperative to one that balances costs and benefits of rapid experimentation and 
disruptive innovation. In certain breakthrough technologies, Europe could choose to ease 
requirements for consumer protection, currently grounded in the precautionary principle, to 
allow faster research on, and rollout of, new disruptive innovation, with the aim of achieving 
better outcomes for citizens rather than minimizing risks. For instance, EU regulation of data 
privacy and autonomous mobility may encourage activities in areas like AI and autonomous 
vehicles, respectively, to move to other regions—and thus for the rules to be made elsewhere. 
Furthermore, it could also ensure that regulation is consistently outcome oriented rather than 
restriction based. Data privacy and consumer protection should continue to rank high on 
Europe’s priority list, but they should be thought of in a way that allows more experimentation 
and innovation. Coul d Europe, for instance, become a front-runner in the secure exchange 
and ownership of data—learning from the good and bad of the “India stack” (biometric 
payment, health data, and so on, which are stored safely and with standardized application 
programming interfaces to access and share)? Or could Europe build on the EU Data 
Governance Act, which has rules for data intermediaries and data sharing, particularly in the 
case of public data? Smart thinking can always be applied to regulation to boost speed. For 
instance, the European Commission has proposed new legislation on batteries and waste 
batteries that will, for the first time, govern the entire battery life cycle; put in place mandatory 
requirements for sustainability, including, for instance, minimum recycled content and end-of-
life management; and introduce due diligence obligations on the sourcing of raw materials.315

7. Develop fast-track regulatory approval and decision-making processes. In disruptive 
innovation, speed matters. Yet Europe tends to move more slowly than other regions, from 
lengthy consensus-based decision making to slower administrative processes, such as 
patenting being half as fast as in the United States. European regulators could take an 
accelerated approach similar to the one that unfolded in the case of COVID-19 vaccines 
to tech-enabled sectors in which it aims to lead, even if that means occasional failures, 
setbacks, and adjustments. This could be particularly powerful when paired with a common 
corporate rule book. The EU could consider ways to adjust governance to enable more speed, 
particularly in light of the possible accessions in coming years of more countries into the 
union. One aspect of this could be cross-industry corporate agenda-setting governance.

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gap8. Embrace faster labor reallocation and reskilling. As disruptions spread, more workers 
will need to change occupation or activities. For rapid technology adoption, labor markets 
will need to be sufficiently flexible. One advantage for Europe in moving swiftly in response to 
changes in labor markets is the strength of its higher education system and its robust pool of 
skills. However, labor market rules will now need to be amended to support faster reallocation. 
Flexicurity principles that protect workers and people rather than jobs, spearheaded by 
Denmark and now adopted in other parts of Europe, are preferable to regulations centered 
on higher employment protection that slow down labor reallocation in the period of 
disruption ahead.

Level playing field with established firms and ecosystems 
Where might state intervention be needed for the competitiveness of European firms in 
a global context? Europe has long promoted competition and has recently taken strong 
measures on digital gatekeepers. It could also do the following: 

9. Ensure a level playing field for smaller firms around natural digital monopolies. The 
EU has already put in place a digital strategy that includes the Digital Markets Act and the 
Digital Services Act to ensure that large online platforms that act as gatekeepers in digital 
markets behave fairly. The Digital Markets Act is an EU regulation to govern natural digital 
monopolies; the EU legislated on service unbundling in rail, power, and telecommunications in 
a similar way. The act provides for major social media messaging services to interoperate with 
other messengers, for instance, and for third-party app stores and payment methods to be 
imposed on iOS and Android. The act includes sanctions in the case of noncompliance, such 
as fines of up to 10 percent of worldwide turnover. For instance, WhatsApp would be required 
to interoperate with other messengers; third-party app stores and payment methods would 
be imposed on iOS and Android. The initiative is a step toward service unbundling in “natural 
digital monopolies” as previously seen in rail, power, and telecoms. The act includes sanctions 
in case of noncompliance; for instance, fines of up to 10 percent of worldwide turnover. 
Europe could consider further stepping up action that allows smaller firms to innovate around 
and on top of those gatekeepers rather than being pushed out or swallowed. This could 
include a continued strong stance and faster action on service unbundling, but also open or 
regulated access to platform services and data. 

10. Initiate a debate about how to protect nascent technology-savvy firms before 
they face the full force of global-scale competitors. European innovators need more 
time to scale in a more fragmented market, and they have lower valuations than their US 
counterparts, making them easy targets. Giving them time to grow could help maximize 
the innovative power of smaller firms and build capabilities in Europe. A number of national 
initiatives originated in this spirit. For instance, the competition authority in the Netherlands 
fined Apple, alleging that it was not offering app creators any alternatives to using its in-house 
payment systems (with 30 percent commissions). Germany’s competition authority has 
been given more powers to act on abusive practices and target companies that dominate a 
particular market. In a similar vein, the United Kingdom is setting up a tech watchdog focused 
on market dominance.316 In addition, other regions have gone as far as mandating local 
operations and capability transfer of global firms. Great care will be needed, because cross-
border competition and takeovers are also a great source of international learning, scaling, 
and funding.

110

McKinsey Global Institute11. Double down on talent as Europe’s prime success factor in future markets. Europe 
has the second-highest number of STEM graduates of any region in the world, but the 
region could ramp up skills development, thereby positioning companies and workers to be 
competitive in an increasingly technology-driven world. Europe is also losing out to the United 
States on attracting immigrant inventors. About 35 percent of the world’s immigrant inventors 
migrate to Europe, but about 60 percent go to the United States.317 Numerous European 
countries already have programs to attract talent, including through skill-based immigration 
systems and talent visas (for example, the United Kingdom recently announced a High 
Potential Individual visa). Yet the number of highly skilled workers who secured EU blue cards 
in 2018 was nearly 80 percent lower than the number of people given employment-based 
immigrant visas each year in the United States.318 European decision makers could consider 
greater coordination, increased budgets, and more visibility to attract, develop, and retain 
STEM and entrepreneurial talent. The recent commitment to a new European Tech Talent 
service desk in collaboration with the European Startup Nations Alliance is an example of 
what can be done.319

Whether or not the competitive arena improves, corporate leaders and 
owners need to step up their game to take risks and compete

Even if policy and regulation were to create a more enabling environment in which European 
firms can compete, they, too, need to step up, developing scale and agility in order to grow 
and succeed—not only today on the national and regional levels, but globally and for decades 
to come. Nonexecutive boards have a strong role to play as they define ambitions, strategies, 
and guardrails. Hedging will not be enough to succeed. Private leaders can usefully take a 
range of actions, of which we highlight the following three examples:

 — Set stretch long-term targets and adjust incentives. In the current environment of 

disruptions, corporations need to set their sights beyond their incumbent business, 
develop a vision for global leadership ten to 20 years out, and take risks and deploy capital 
and R&D investment commensurate with that vision. European companies and their 
boards could also consider adjusting executive and employee compensation to better 
align with those visions and the risk-taking needed. Today, only about 5 percent of the 
private-sector workforce in Europe has some kind of employee ownership, compared 
with about 20 percent in the United States.320 The largest European tech companies have 
already taken this approach.

 — Leverage programmatic M&A and alliances to acquire the scale and capabilities 

needed.321 This would extend to cross-border European and global consolidation, 
including—painfully—sell-side M&A where global leadership is out of reach. It would also 
include using vertical and capability-based acquisitions to ramp up the development of 
innovation strengths and ecosystems, for instance using corporate venture capital. This 
is the approach taken by German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim, whose 
corporate venture capital arm has investment capacity of €250 million, enabling the 
group to access new therapies, including cancer treatments.322 Companies should also be 
proactive in seeking and developing cross-sector alliances to accelerate the development 
of transversal technologies, as Total and PSA are doing on battery manufacturing.323 
Companies and entrepreneurs can also seek to set up new disrupters.

Securing Europe’s competitiveness: Addressing its technology gap — Invest in innovation and technology governance and capabilities at scale and pace. 
Companies will need to implement agile and more customer-centric innovation 
governance able to deal with higher-risk, long-term projects. They will need to find—or 
reallocate—funds on a larger scale and target them more toward long-term innovation 
and business development than used to be the case. And they will need to build skills. 
Siemens, for instance, enabled 380,000 employees in 200 countries to upskill and reskill 
in digital capabilities in 2021 through a dedicated learning platform.324 

European countries have been leaders on sustainability and inclusion. They are now 
concerned with the security of supply chains, energy, food, and defense. How much should 
the region also worry about its corporate and technology gap, which is jeopardizing future 
growth and strategic autonomy—and when? Can the momentum of common action triggered 
by war in Ukraine now also provide the impetus to consider the trade-offs needed for 
technology and competitiveness that have long felt difficult? 

More work will likely be needed to determine how to tackle Europe’s gaps in corporate 
performance and innovation in detail and in practice, technology by technology and sector by 
sector, building resilience into the European model for the long term.

Governments and companies worldwide are pledging 

to achieve net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases. 

The report looks at the economic transformation that 

the transition would entail, estimating the changes 

in demand, capital spending, costs, and jobs, to 250,

Will productivity and growth return after the 

COVID-19 crisis? (March 2021)

Bold innovation by some firms under the pressure of 

the pandemic could deliver a productivity dividend, 

but that depends on corporate action broadening 

and robust demand. The research finds that there is 

potential to accelerate annual productivity growth by 

about one percentage point in the period to 2024.
