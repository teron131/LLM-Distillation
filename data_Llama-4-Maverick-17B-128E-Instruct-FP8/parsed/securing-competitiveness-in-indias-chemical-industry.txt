Executive summary

For a decade, the Indian chemical industry has been a global outperformer in demand growth and 
shareholder wealth creation. However, global headwinds have recently interrupted this momentum. Chemical 
companies in India could navigate these challenges and enhance their future prospects by boosting their 
competitiveness. 

Indian chemical industry: Interrupted momentum 
Indian chemical companies performed better than their global counterparts with strong total shareholder 
returns (TSR) growing at an annual rate of 20 percent between 2014 and 2023, compared to the global 
average of 6 percent. This changed, however, between 2020 and 2023, when average TSR growth for Indian 
chemical companies dipped to 9 percent due to falling margins. While the chemical industry also used to 
deliver better returns than the associated upstream and downstream segments in the value chain in India, 
this trend, too, has seen a downturn in the past three years.1 

The effect of global headwinds 
Multiple factors explain the declining competitiveness of Indian chemical companies. The first two are 
the fallout of stalling global demand and of overcapacity in key export markets. In the past two years, the 
chemical industry has faced a widening trade deficit with exports declining 4 percent annually.2 Year-on-year 
(y-o-y) growth of India’s chemical exports to North America dropped significantly, from 21 percent (between 
2019 and 2021) to 2 percent (from 2021 to 2023). Europe and Asia–Pacific (APAC), which accounted for 
about half of India’s chemical exports, also saw steep dips in y-o-y market growth (from 11 percent to 1 
percent in Europe, and from 10 percent to 4 percent in APAC).3 

Overcapacity in Europe could drag utilization below 70 percent by 2030 for several products, as capacity 
remains high at home and demand stalls abroad.4 Declining demand in APAC could lower utilization and 
prompt oversupply till 2025, driven by the current demand-supply dynamics in China.5 In the near term, China 
is expected to become a net exporter of petrochemicals while it has so far been a net importer. Over the 
past year, Chinese consumption has declined by nearly 15 percent. The consequent cut in export prices is 
pressuring chemical companies in India. 

The third factor is commodity price volatility. Geographical unrest, global overcapacity for a few chemicals, 
and demand-supply dynamics in China have caused and aggravated market volatility. For example, over the 
past two years, petrochemical margins dropped due to rising feedstock prices and falling capacity utilization. 
These challenges could intensify with continuing oversupply. 

While the headwinds are a common backdrop, the performance of all companies has not been uniform. The 
global economic outlook has turned volatile, but some companies have differentiated themselves through 
building their resilience and competitiveness.

Focus areas for India’s chemical leaders 
Over the past few years, chemical companies in India have emphasized growth and capital 
excellence. However, securing a competitive advantage in a volatile market could require a broader 
approach that builds in functional excellence and streamlines margin expansion. In this context, 
company leaders could focus on five proposed priorities: 

1.  Building functional excellence in every pocket of the organization: Indian chemical 

companies can build this muscle, especially through digital and analytics-based performance 
improvement that could increase their annual EBITDA by 400 to 500 basis points. 

2.  Internationalization and becoming truly global: In a macroenvironment of stalling global 

demand, Indian companies could still seek out new value pools. Toward this, they could build 
or acquire a suite of institutional capabilities such as global business development, customer 
access channels, local legal entities, supply chain infrastructure (warehouses, depots, et cetera), 
application development setups, and deep regional regulatory understanding. Doing so could 
help companies increase overall annual revenue by 10 to 30 percent. 

3.  Accelerating innovation: As they globalize, Indian chemical companies could focus on both 

application-based innovation and new product development, particularly import substitution. 
This could also potentially increase annual revenue by around 5 to 10 percent.6 A sharp focus 
on innovation and research has helped incumbent chemical companies create differentiation 
between them and their competitors. 

4.  Sustainability as a dual play—defense and offense: As the industry accelerates toward 

decarbonization to meet stricter regulatory requirements and changing customer expectations, 
companies could proactively develop an offense play where they build green alternatives based 
on green feedstock and formulations while also investing in bio-based opportunities. 

5.  Deepening and globalizing their talent pool: Companies could equip themselves with the right 
skill set and capabilities across functions such as research and development, technical sales, 
and shop-floor operations. 

Of these, the first two, improving functional excellence using digital tools, and adopting truly global 
strategies, could help to enhance margins in the near term. The remaining ideas could ensure the 
continued relevance and competitiveness of these companies. Such priorities could help the Indian 
chemical industry to shape the future of chemical companies and potentially meet the ambition of a 
US $1 trillion chemicals market by 2040.7

India’s chemical industry: 
Interrupted momentum

The Indian chemical industry has consistently rewarded its shareholders more than its counterparts 
abroad and associated industries at home. However, over the past three years, margin pressure has 
impacted returns and raised concerns about future performance.

The challenge of margins for a robust performer 
Between 2014 and 2023, India’s chemical industry outperformed the global chemicals market. Robust 
revenue growth on the back of rising demand, a keen focus on profitability, and a rise in industry multiples 
kept total shareholder returns (TSR) rising at a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 percent during 
this period.8 In the same time frame, its global counterparts were delivering returns at under 8.5 percent 
CAGR. 

India’s appeal as a manufacturing hub, coupled with its improved ease of doing business, energized 
the Indian chemical sector.9 With reliable access to raw materials, and low capital and operating costs 
(including labor, utility, and overhead expenses), the industry consistently optimized operations and built 
cost competitiveness. This, along with a culture of continuous process innovation, helped the industry 
deliver robust returns.

During this time, the Indian chemical industry also consistently surpassed associated upstream and 
downstream industries in the value chain within India, as well as the broad market index (Exhibit 2), on 
average, over the decade. However, the same trajectory appears again: between 2014 and 2023, the 
Sensex TSR had a CAGR of 13 percent, lower than the 20 percent for chemicals; but between 2020 and 
2023, the Sensex TSR attained 16 percent growth, nearly double that of chemicals, which had fallen to 
9 percent. This drop in performance requires closer examination.

The impact on total shareholder returns 
The TSR decomposition10 of 38 top chemical companies in India shows that the TSR decline is the 
outcome of their margins falling from 12 percent, on average, in 2020 to 10 percent by 2023 (Exhibit 3).  
The gradual erosion in shareholder returns witnessed in the past three years is at odds with the 
attractive revenue growth during the same period (2020 to 2023). Revenue CAGR rose to 17 percent 
at this time, from 11 percent between 2017 and 2020. However, a part of the revenue growth between 
the two time periods can be attributed to price escalation in the chemical industry, as reflected in 
the wholesale price index (WPI) of chemicals and chemical products growing at a CAGR of 11 percent 
between 2020 and 2023.11

10 TSR decomposition explains the impact of key factors such as revenue growth, change in margins, and invested capital on TSR in that 
period. TSR depends on factors affecting capital gains as well as other factors, such as dividend yield, affecting cash flow contribution.

The drop in TSR occurs against the backdrop of an increasing influence of revenue growth, rather than 
margins, as a determinant of industry performance. Mapping the revenue CAGR and net operating profit 
after tax (NOPAT) margin trend for the 38 companies studied showed that 23 companies grew their 
revenue CAGR between 2020 and 2023, as compared to between 2017 and 2020. This growth, however, 
coincided with a decline in their average NOPAT margins and consequently the TSR across the same 
period (Exhibit 4).

02

The effect of global 
headwinds

The pressures faced by the chemical industry reflect the sluggish global consumption over the last four 
years. At the root of the slowdown is an interplay of three factors: stalling demand growth in India’s export 
markets, overcapacity in major global economies, and commodity price fluctuations. Together, these are 
hurting the competitiveness of the industry as a whole and reducing the margins of chemical companies in 
India. 

The world’s top consumers have been slowing down spending. Per capita consumption in countries such 
as the US, China, Japan, and the EU nations has been slackening, and projections indicate stagnation 
between now and 2030.12 Per capita consumption in India, however, is expected to rise.

Intertwined factors affecting competitiveness
A combination of three headwinds has been affecting Indian chemical companies. First, while the country 
has healthy consumption growth at home, its chemical exports are facing stalling demand growth, with a 
4 percent annual decline over the past two years. Second, as India’s biggest importers see their demand 
slow down or rapidly add internal capacity, Indian exports to these countries are falling, dragging industry 
margins with them. Finally, external factors such as ongoing geopolitical instability are disrupting 
supply chains. This leads raw material prices to fluctuate, further impacting competitiveness in a highly 
commodity-dependent industry.

Global stalling demand and overcapacity 
As import dependency grows and exports decline, India’s trade deficit has doubled since 2019 (Exhibit 
5). The 4 percent decline in exports comes on top of around a 5 percent drop in volumes across exports. 
The volumes of petrochemical (petchem) exports, primarily building blocks and polymers, have fallen at 
a rate of over 15 percent in the past two years.

Exhibit 5
A 4 percent year-over-year decline in exports, as imports increased, led to a

Petchem13 is the key segment facing a twin blow: exports have been declining at around 8 percent, 
while imports have been rising at around 8 percent. The widening trade deficit contributes to around 
80 percent of the total chemicals trade imbalance. Lagging cracker infrastructure in the country and 
the scarcity of key feedstocks and minerals could continue this trend. Polymer imports, which make 
up a third of all petchem imports, have grown steadily at 15 to 16 percent over the past four years, 
pushing up imports overall.14 Of these imports, the two largest polymers, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and 
polypropylene (PP), are expected to account for around 13 percent and around 8 percent, respectively, 
of total petchem imports.15 The dip in exports is primarily due to building blocks such as C8 (paraxylene) 
and C6 (benzene).

13 Petchem includes building blocks, intermediates, and end products (C1–C8 derivatives).

The specialty chemicals16 segment is expected to drive exports growth, showing a consistent growth of 
around 5 percent y-o-y over the past four years. India could remain a net exporter in the segment, driven 
by agrochemicals, dyes and pigments, cosmetics/personal care, and food ingredient chemicals that 
account for around 80 percent of total Indian specialty chemical exports. While exports in the inorganic 
chemicals segment have grown steadily, contributing to nearly 8 to 10 percent of exported value, the 
segment remains reliant on imported raw materials such as phosphorus, potassium, and titanium. 

Across all geographies, exports show a drop in a comparison of growth rates from 2021 to 2023 versus 
2019 to 2021 (Exhibit 6). North America grew 21 percent y-o-y from 2019 to 2021. However, from 2021 
to 2023, that trend was reversed, with petchem and specialty chemicals exports dropping, likely due to 
supply chain constraints and industry destocking. For example, in 2023, chemical companies carried 
approximately 75 days of inventory, compared to the prepandemic average of 45 days.17 

16 Specialty chemicals include dyes and pigments, agrochemicals, electronic chemicals, flavors and fragrances, cosmetic chemicals, 

nutraceutical ingredients, food and feed additives, plastics additives, rubber-processing chemicals, adhesives and sealants, construction 
chemicals, specialty polymers, cleaners, industrial and institutional, surfactants, textile chemicals, water management chemicals, paper 
chemicals, flame retardants, lubricating oil additives, antioxidants, petroleum refining and chemical process catalysts, biocides, and 
corrosion inhibitors.

In Latin America, too, growth of imports from India declined from 17 percent in 2019 to 2021 to minus 4 
percent from 2021 to 2023. Overall, total imports fell by 37 percent with reducing trade deficits, indicating 
an increasing reliance on domestic production. Additionally, competition with Chinese suppliers leading to 
price cuts has potentially contributed further to the decrease. 

Europe and APAC, which constitute nearly 50 percent of the Indian exports market, showed a 
consumption slump in the period of 2021 to 2023 compared with the preceding two years (Exhibit 7). In 
Europe, consumption slowed down from 11 percent yearly growth to 1 percent, while APAC experienced a 
drop from 10 percent to 4 percent in this period.

Overcapacity in Europe 

The falling demand for European exports means that utilization across a range of products could dip 
to under 70 percent by 2030,18 an estimate based on existing supply, currently announced capacity 
additions, and forecasted demand projections. 

European chemical exports are facing headwinds across geographies. In China, the surge in local 
capacity has led to a nearly 7 percent year-on-year decline in exports from Europe. Inflation Reduction 
Act incentives for domestic manufacturers in the US are also potentially impacting demand from 
Europe.19 In the Middle East, there has been a move toward specialty chemicals, away from upstream 
crude oil domination, with increasing investments by state-owned players in specialty chemicals in 
China.

Stalling demand in APAC 
Lower utilization is expected across major petchem value chains (ethylene, propylene, polyethylene 
terephthalate, PVC) in APAC. This is expected to result in an oversupply in the near term until 2025, 
driven primarily by a slowdown in demand in China.20 Further, capacity additions of naphtha crackers, 
ethane crackers, methanol-to-olefins and coal-to-olefins plants, and propylene dehydrogenation 
(PDH) plants are expected for polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Here, the analysis of 
utilization is based on demand projections. 

For near-term supply, capacity is projected based on announcements to invest in facilities, while for 
the longer term, conservative estimates have been derived.21 In the medium term till 2027, the market 
is expected to be balanced for PE and PVC due to increasing utilization in the face of anticipated 
demand. However, PP and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) could remain in oversupply with an overall 
slowdown in the plastics, resin, and fiber markets. In the longer term, by 2032, these products are 
expected to reach a balance between supply and demand.

China’s growing capacity is likely to disrupt global markets going forward. The country plans additional 
capacity of around 22 million tons for propylene and 30 million tons for ethylene by 2027. This, along 
with overall demand sluggishness, creates an overcapacity scenario. In fact, around 60 percent of 
the confirmed capacity additions for ethylene worldwide is expected from China.22 From being a net 
importer of petrochemicals, China is projected to surpass self-sufficiency and become an exporter. 

Overall, in China, production has risen by 6 percent from 2019 to 2023 (Exhibit 8, where the production 
index is shown with production value in 2019 indexed to 100). In contrast, total consumption grew by 19 
percent from 2019 to 2022 but declined by 15 percent the following year. Driven by a 13 percent fall in 
sales and an 8 percent dip in imports, this decline has created an oversupply. As a result, Indian players 
face steep pricing pressure from Chinese counterparts in export markets, and as demand continues to 
stagnate, Indian export value could further decline.

Commodity price fluctuations 
A number of global supply chain disruptions are impacting energy supply worldwide. The chemical 
industry, heavily dependent on commodities, is feeling the heat of market volatility. We analyzed this in 
the context of petrochemicals based on the two key drivers—feedstock prices and capacity utilization. 
When crude oil prices dipped from 2015 to 2018, margins soared for PE and PS (Exhibit 9), reflecting 
a healthy demand-supply balance. However, 2021 to 2023 saw a double blow to margins, as crude oil 
prices declined by nearly 17 percent and utilization declined by three to five percentage points globally.

As companies continue to diversify into specialty chemicals, the impact of commodity price volatility goes 
down. However, oversupply could continue in the coming years, causing utilization challenges and margin 
pressure. 

The need for resilience 
Despite the headwinds forming a common backdrop for all chemical companies, a few have successfully 
built resilience and performed better than their peers. These companies have typically overcome the 
headwinds by adopting an agile operating model, meticulously identifying value chain and market 
adjacencies and building in cost prudence across operations and capital expenditure. In this context, 
chemical companies in India could reflect on some crucial questions: 

1.  Have they capitalized on their cost leadership position in key value chains where they have a 

structural competitiveness? 

2.  Have they doubled down across exhaustive demand centers, becoming truly global or attaining a fair 

market share in primary/secondary home markets?

3.  Have they ensured that application development with their customers/partners is a core part of 

their DNA? Has customer centricity been their key area of focus? 

4.  Have they holistically thought through the approach on value creation through the shift toward 

sustainability? Are they using an offense approach or playing defense? 

5.  Have they considered inorganic strategies for growth and delivering value to customers, such as 

mergers and acquisitions (M&A)? 

The answers to these questions could guide companies as they consider their approach to build 
resilience for the future.

Focus areas for India’s 
chemical leaders

Securing a competitive advantage could shape greater resilience for companies in a volatile market. The 
leaders of chemical companies could consider five priorities: striving for functional excellence using digital, 
becoming truly global, accelerating application-based innovation and product development, focusing 
on sustainability (both defense and offense), and deepening and globalizing the talent pool. The first two, 
improving functional excellence using digital tools, and adopting truly global strategies, could enhance 
margins in the near term. The other three could foster continued relevance and competitiveness.

1.  Building functional excellence in every pocket of the organization: Most Indian chemical 

companies underinvested in this during the growth phase of the industry. The adoption of digital and 
analytics-based performance improvement, where most Indian companies have remained behind 
peers, could help to enhance annual EBITDA by 400 to 500 basis points. 

2.  Becoming truly global: Even in a macro scenario of stalling global demand, Indian companies could 
identify new value pools, and go after them by building or acquiring a suite of institutional capabilities 
such as global business development, customer access channels, local legal entities, supply chain 
infrastructure (warehouses, depots, et cetera), application development setups, and deep regional 
regulatory understanding. Companies building on these moves could see an overall annual revenue 
increase of 10 to 30 percent. 

3.  Accelerating innovation: A sharp focus on innovation and research has helped incumbent chemical 
companies differentiate against their competitors. Indian chemical companies could focus on both 
application-based innovation and new product development, particularly import substitution. This 
could increase annual income by around 5 to 10 percent. 

4.  Sustainability as a dual play (defense and offense): While the industry accelerates toward 

decarbonization as a defense move to meet tighter regulations and changing customer expectations, 
companies could also develop an offense play. This could entail building green alternatives and 
formulations while also investing in bio-based opportunities. 

5.  Deepening and globalizing the talent pool: Companies could equip themselves with the right skill 
sets and capabilities across functions such as research and development, technical sales, and shop-
floor operations.

1. Building functional excellence in every pocket of the organization
Chemical companies could control costs through digital and analytics-led operations excellence, dynamic 
pricing, procurement excellence, and supply chain management. 

Digital interventions are a relatively untapped tool to help chemical companies embed operational 
excellence. Industry 4.0 technologies such as advanced analytics, AI, and cloud computing have made the 
leap from proof of concept to the shop floor in a host of industries, and the chemical industry must not be 
left behind.

Companies embarking on a digital and analytics enablement journey could be guided by focused 
improvement areas such as the World Economic Forum (WEF)’s  accredited 4th Industrial Revolution 
(4IR) Lighthouse (Exhibit 10). These could help to chart the path to transform factories, enabling them to 
change ways of working and empower analytics-backed decision making in everyday operations. The 
4IR technologies could de-bottleneck capacities, improve conversion, and reduce costs without major 
capital expenditure. Digital initiatives surface complex interrelationships between material properties 
and process parameters, helping companies to improve yield, energy efficiency, throughput, and 
product quality for a potential annual EBITDA boost of around four to five percentage points across 
manufacturing interventions.

Securing competitiveness in India’s chemical industry

In the last six years, only two chemical players (materials and petrochemicals) are among the 153 WEF-
identified Lighthouses across different industry sectors, with none from India.23 With greater digital uptake, 
this could change. A digital and analytics leader in petrochemicals and refining (one of the two WEF 
chemical Lighthouses mentioned above) achieved around 10 percent annual EBITDA impact through 20 
advanced analytics use cases, ranging from yield and throughput improvement using sensors, to quality 
improvement through predictive modeling and in-process traceability. 

While 90 percent of CEOs acknowledge the transformative potential of digital and analytics, only around 
17 percent have actively invested in such initiatives.24 Surveys show that three misconceptions are at the 
root of this gap: first, the belief that the talent required to set up digital interventions is tough to onboard; 
second, that the current data and technology architecture of the company cannot support advanced 
analytics; and third, a perceived difficulty of upskilling the existing workforce to adopt the data-backed 
decision-making mindset. Overcoming these limiting beliefs could help unlock significant value. 

Dynamic pricing is especially relevant for the chemical industry, with its volatile prices of basic building 
blocks, capacity constraints, and demand-supply imbalances. It also has buyers from multiple industries, 
each with varying willingness to pay. Being able to frequently adjust end-product prices is especially useful 
in this context and could help improve return on sales by 1 to 3 percent.25 

A global specialties player used advanced analytics-based machine-learning algorithms for pricing. It implemented a 
better-structured system that included features such as appropriate premiums for differentiated products, levels of 
discount for large and long-term customers, and the capabilities to track and ensure pass-through of raw material cost 
increases. Over the period of a year, the company increased its return on sales by three percentage points.

Data-driven value-based pricing is a useful tool to segment customers for dynamic pricing. This could allow 
companies to set transaction-level prices for differentiated products such as specialty chemicals, factoring 
the value created by the product, brand value, competition, and customer relationship. Several chemical 
companies worldwide now adopt a “next-best-alternative”26 pricing approach for their largest customer 
accounts that buy differentiated products. 

Companies keen to try dynamic pricing could set up the right data infrastructure to support digital pricing 
tools and put in place organizational systems and processes to adhere to price realization.27 

Procurement excellence, or obtaining raw materials at the right price, specification, quantity, and quality, 
is fundamental to company profitability. Purchasing expenditures are equivalent to 40 to 60 percent of

26 Next-best-alternative pricing is an approach that helps sales teams set a price based on an assessment of the incremental value to the 

customer that the supplier’s product creates in comparison with the customer’s next-best-alternative product.

sales revenue for specialty chemical players and 60 to 80 percent of revenue for commodity products 
manufacturers.28 Raw material pricing volatility further creates an imperative for the right purchasing 
decisions.

Procurement leaders could use digital tools and advanced analytics to boost resilience in this scenario. 
They could examine their exposure to EBITDA fluctuations through commodity price risks by analyzing 
and investigating the correlations between the prices of feedstocks and their end products.29 They 
could also use data-driven models to predict price movements for optimal procurement decisions. 
Such models are built through a fundamental understanding of market forces, identifying and mapping 
variables, defining potential situations for modeling, followed by data ingestion, and feature engineering 
of the variables identified as well as developing and sustaining price-prediction models and simulators. 

Building on top of digital, generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) could improve performance and 
unlock substantial value in procurement, especially across spend bases consisting of indirect and MRO 
(maintenance repair operation) spends. Gen AI can operationally classify unstructured data such as 
work orders for spares, inspection reports for services, and shift logs for shop-floor-based maintenance. 
This enables the archetyping of critical spend buckets at a granular level, tightens external vendor 
management, and improves workforce efficiency.

AI models have helped companies to generate a forecasted price curve for buying commodities, through price prediction 
based on machine-learning techniques and geospatial analysis. Take the example of a chemical manufacturer that 
developed a model to predict the price of coal, using index movements, demand-supply dynamics, econometric data, 
weather forecasts, and satellite imagery. Price predictions were used to inform an algorithmic procurement strategy, 
improving buying and hedging risk. Such models can be customized to simulate potential future scenarios of prices under 
the changes of specific variables, incorporating private and public data to ensure companies capture value.

While digitizing procurement could be the answer, a McKinsey survey of chief procurement officers and 
CXOs found that more than half (55 percent) did not know the best-in-class solutions for procurement.30 
It will also be important to rethink the capabilities necessary for enabling digital procurement, for 
instance, setting up the right channels to validate market intelligence, cross-category collaboration for 
initiatives such as e-auctions, inventory optimization, et cetera. 

With respect to supply chain management, chemical companies are experiencing high demand 
variability and long forecast lead times, increasingly complex and tightly interconnected raw material 
value chains, and heightened customer expectations. We see three areas of potential significant 
impact from digital and analytics in chemical value chains: first, probabilistic demand forecasting 
using predictive analytics; second, end-to-end network optimization including closed-loop planning 
and margin-optimized production; and third, robotics in material handling within warehouses and 
transportation.

Securing competitiveness in India’s chemical industry

2. Becoming truly global 
In a macro scenario where global demand is stalling, companies can seek out the most strategic spaces 
where they could play—that is, the right international markets and the right end-use segments—through 
data-driven micromarket mapping and customer universe buildout. Armed with data on regional trends, 
target customers in end-use industries, market size, market share, and growth and margin potential, 
companies could discover cross- and upselling opportunities in global markets. Tapping into such new 
value pools could potentially increase annual revenues by around 10 to 30 percent. 

It would then be critical to design a how-to-win road map to capture export markets. Companies could 
invest in infrastructure in the form of local legal entities, supply chain setups near key ports (including 
stocking units, long-term shipping line agreements, et cetera), and sales offices for their second-
home global markets. While traditional go-to-market choices such as direct versus distributor will be 
important, Indian chemical companies could also tap into evolving new-age digital channels in the 
mature chemical markets of China and Europe. These include open B2B platforms (online stores, deal 
match portals, vertical buy/sell platforms) and brand proprietary B2B platforms. 

Investing in key talent pools such as global sales teams proficient in local languages and market 
dynamics, application development scientists, and regulatory experts is also important. Our research 
on B2B customer decision journeys shows that 80 percent of the buyers in the chemical and materials 
industries find it helpful to speak to someone in person when they get a completely new product or 
service. Having a direct presence in a global market could have significant implications for a sales 
organization going to market.31

Additionally, companies could build global sales organizations to create a dynamic experience for 
customers and use digital tools and data to power sales operations. Providing e-commerce-like 
transparency and resolving pain points across the customer decision journey through digital platforms 
could improve customer experience scores.

A global B2B chemical company rolled out a new commercial performance management tool with a tailor-made 
dashboard to its sales organization. The interactive tool allowed users to see detailed financials, assess pricing 
opportunities, and check funnel progress. They could filter the data as needed for crucial transparency on matters related 
to the team, individual sales representatives, and even customers. This data unlocked consistently fact-based, productive 
discussions at the regular performance huddles across all levels of the organization.¹

18, 2022, McKinsey.

M&A could also act as a major contributor to top-line growth among companies, using bolt-on 
acquisitions to access new geographical markets, market segments, products, and technical 
applications. International M&A could help to acquire new digital capabilities, build resilient supply 
chains, and upgrade operating models.

3. Accelerating innovation 
Indian chemical companies, as they internationalize, could focus on improving both application-
based innovation and new product development, particularly for import substitution. With growing 
commoditization in parts of the industry, many question the value of innovation and the expense of 
R&D versus returns. While innovation performance can vary a great deal, the outcome depends on the 
familiarity of technology and degree of penetration in the end market or application. The development 
journey for any new product or application is complex, with a significant lead time. However, despite this 
lag between implementation and results, the benefits are substantial. For companies, such initiatives 
could bring about an average annual uplift of 10 to 30 percent of revenue. 

Companies could start prioritizing their new product development pipeline based on market or customer 
needs, putting a clear and appropriate product strategy in place. Additionally, since India imports 
approximately US $60 billion of chemicals today,32 it represents an opportunity to tap this white-space 
demand through import substitution. The application of gen AI in R&D could also be a tool to open up a 
variety of opportunities (Exhibit 11).

Once a focused product pipeline is designed, a stage-gate process could be institutionalized. This 
could be digitally enabled through recipe and patent logs, checklists and signoff across stages, and 
powered by digital dashboards to track progress and lower cost and time of development. Postlaunch 
excellence is equally important to introduce a new product to customers with a compelling pitch and 
sales conversion process. 

Application-based innovation can also generate significant value in familiar markets. For example, while a 
silicon-focused chemical company could be a leader in textiles-focused siloxanes or elastomers, it would 
still have white spaces to tap into in other applications and end-use segments such as footwear, leather, 
construction, personal care, et cetera. It might target these opportunities through focused application 
development. 

Companies could get through difficult times by investing in smart R&D and innovation to find new 
sources of growth and profit. They can differentiate themselves in this way, creating value out of tough 
experiences and putting strategic distance between them and their competitors.

An agrochemical player used AI-driven analytics on IP trends to identify gaps and opportunities. The company discovered 
it was behind its peers in patent activity in its top three investment areas. A broader look at the sector level of activity 
also indicated if there were any other potential blind spots, while peer group activity comparison showed areas where the 
client was leading beyond the gaps in their portfolio. This resulted in a 30 to 40 percent increase in research productivity.

4. Sustainability as a dual play (defense and offense) 
As investors and consumers increasingly expect strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
practices from companies, organizations in India and abroad are responding with efforts to decarbonize 
and attain net zero. By the very nature of its industry, chemicals is a space that can make a big difference 
to such efforts, given that it contributes to 2 percent of the total global emissions and 1 percent of India’s 
emissions.33 Indian chemical companies have the opportunity to play a defense game and keep pace with 
rising stakeholder expectations and also go on the offense with their sustainability initiatives. 

Three actions could constitute a defense play. First is by tracking and evaluating ESG impact. ESG 
scores are increasingly important as drivers of market capitalization, therefore it is imperative for Indian 
companies to track their ESG impact, unpacking their scores to examine and compare the underlying 
performance measures. 

Second, managing and understanding exposure is important. Climate change risk could eventually be 
priced into market value. Therefore, companies must take stock of their exposure to climate change and 
its possible impact (for example, effluent discharge, carbon footprint, et cetera). 

Third, the time is ripe for companies to act, moving beyond pledges to actionable, detailed transition 
plans for net-zero commitments that could earn stakeholder trust and benefits (for example, lower cost of 
capital). 

Playing the offense game on sustainability is an opportunity to modify and shift the portfolio of chemical 
companies. Exploring green growth opportunities could require two measures: introducing green 
products developed through sustainable processes, and entering greener segments with bio-based 
investments.34 Indian chemical companies may want to explore opportunities to introduce bio-based or 
less carbon-intensive products, thereby balancing their portfolio of products. There exist a plethora of 
white spaces in the chemical industry that companies could leverage through green business initiatives 
(Exhibit 12).

Many Indian chemical companies are yet to gather significant momentum with their sustainability 
commitments, and those on this journey are largely taking a defense-first approach so far. Proactively 
prioritizing green initiatives could be a growth opportunity for chemical companies, ensuring their 
relevance, demand, and competitiveness in the long term. 

5. Deepening and globalizing the talent pool 
India’s chemical companies would need to overcome a critical talent shortage across all levels and 
functions of the organization to secure competitiveness. With many institutes lacking the right curriculum 
and infrastructure, India relies on foreign talent for chemical R&D.35 Similar issues affect the blue-collar 
workforce. They lack the essential vocational skills related to basic chemistry, adherence to standard 
operating processes, and awareness on environment, health, and safety (EHS). This, coupled with 
inadequate training infrastructure, results in an annual deficit of 100,000 to 150,000 skilled workers in 
the chemical industry.36

This talent gap could be overcome in a few ways. To train the blue-collar workforce, companies could 
direct part of their corporate social responsibility budgets to support apprenticeships at industry 
and technical institutes, such as industrial training institutes (ITIs). The government could also help 
set up more ITIs near chemical belts and encourage private players to participate in public-private 
partnerships. Technical institutes could introduce relevant courses such as chemical processes, 
reaction engineering, and equipment selection, while implementing SLAs and quality checks to bring 
in competent faculty. 

Bridging the R&D talent gap would require supporting students with crucial industry connections. 
For example, exchange programs or internships in sunrise segments including operational data 
analytics and industrial biochemistry could be added. Directing private fund investments to institutes 
for upgrading research labs and hiring PhD-qualified professors would also strengthen the R&D 
ecosystem. Setting up labs and application development centers in global chemical hubs could help 

Securing competitiveness in India’s chemical industry

27

companies boost their holistic talent profile. Since a lack of strong leadership and a robust middle-
management layer can act as a bottleneck and hinder growth, companies could hire top global sales, 
technical, and management teams across geographies and maintain a global leadership team. 

Creating awareness about the industry’s commitment to growing end markets and working to address 
the world’s sustainability problems could be an asset. It could help to attract and retain top talent that 
has the most relevant knowledge and skills, and give that talent a platform to innovate and get greater
