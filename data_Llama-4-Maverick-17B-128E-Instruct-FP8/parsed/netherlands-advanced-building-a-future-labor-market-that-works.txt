Netherlands advanced: 
Building a future  
labor market that works

The Netherlands has high ambitions for living standards, housing, 
healthcare, education, and the environment, requiring higher 
productivity growth through technology and a “train of job transitions.”

This report is a collaborative effort by Dieuwert Inia, Hagar Heijmans, Marc de Jong, Reinout Goedvolk, 
and Sven Smit, with Alexander Veldhuijzen, Martijn Repko, and Wouter van Aanholt. 

For many years, the Netherlands has enjoyed 
a robust economy and strong workforce. With a 
vast active workforce of 9.6 million people (out of 
a population of 17.6 million),1 the country has one 
of the highest employment rates2 and workforce 
productivity rates in the European Union.3 Globally, 
it ranks fifth for competitiveness,4 sixth for 
happiness,5 ninth for social progress,6 and tenth on 
the UN Human Development Index.7

ability to reach its social and economic goals. 
Most notably, an aging population due to low 
birth rates and declining productivity growth are 
causing tightness in the labor market.8 Meanwhile, 
increasing inequality in terms of income and labor 
conditions,9 signs of declining quality in education,10 
and increasing prevalence of mental and physical 
health issues11 put further pressure on the market.

However, ongoing trends are putting pressure on 
the labor market and could hamper the country’s

2030 labor market that works for the future of the 
Netherlands, two levers are essential: increasing 
productivity by investing in technological 
innovation, and realizing a “train of job transitions” 
through reskilling and upward development to 
move people to the (higher-productivity) jobs 
demanded. Last, it proposes priorities for an 
orchestrated action plan for three critical shortage 
areas to get the train moving.

Projections for the Dutch labor  
market in 2030
While demands on the workforce are rising, 
the supply of labor is not. The result is a 
growing tightness in the labor market, marked 
by an increased number of job openings per 
unemployed person.12 The tightness in the labor 
market has increased in the past ten years (with 
the COVID-19 pandemic stalling this trend only 
temporarily). By 2022, 54 percent of employers 
were struggling to attract new employees,13 and as 
of first quarter 2024, there were 110 vacancies per 
100 unemployed people.14

According to our projections for 2030, a modeled 
scenario with continuation of the demand growth 
coming from historic GDP growth (1.6 percent 
CAGR from 2010 to 2022)15 combined with the  
low productivity growth of the same period  
(0.4 percent CAGR)16 and limited increase of the 
working population would triple the tightness in  
the labor market, resulting in a labor shortage  
of 1.4 million people, or a demand for 390 people per 
100 unemployed. This is the result of historic labor 
demand growth on top of the vacancies in 2022 
due to economic growth (more than 940,000) and 
societal ambitions (more than 280,000) compared 

with a projected labor force increase of 250,000. If 
the increased demand is fulfilled, it could result in a 
GDP growth of slightly more than 2 percent per year. 
Conscious socioeconomic choices regarding sector-
specific policies, investments, and subsidies could 
lower the labor shortage to 0.9 million or increase 
it to 1.8 million. These choices would not solve the 
structural shortage, but they are still vital. Pressure 
on the market is likely to force the market to settle, 
potentially on suboptimal scenarios that could 
affect multiple factors such as broad prosperity or 
economic growth.

Technological innovations that could decrease the 
pressure on the labor market could shift demand 
toward jobs that require more-advanced skills. In a 
scenario with 1.8 percent productivity growth per 
year, based on the slower Europe scenario from the 
report A new future of work: The race to deploy AI 
and raise skills in Europe and beyond,17 150,000 jobs 
are expected to disappear in segments with declining 
demand and 400,000 are expected to be gained in 
segments with increasing demand between 2022 
and 2030. Overall, jobs are projected to move from 
basic- and intermediate-skill work to advanced- 
skill work, particularly among knowledge workers  
(Exhibit E1). 

Existing shortages are likely to increase, in particular 
in three critical areas of work: skilled manual labor, 
digital and tech jobs, and health and social care. 
The Netherlands could face shortages in these 
areas of work of 100,000, 105,000, and 245,000 
people, respectively. New inflow will likely not fill the 
high demand in these specific shortage areas. This 
means people who are already in the market will 
have to fill these jobs, requiring increased mobility 
within the labor market. Most people will not be able 
to transition directly from areas with oversupply to 

Existing shortages are likely to increase, 
in particular in three critical areas of 
work: skilled manual labor, digital and 
tech jobs, and health and social care.

those with shortages, because their skills will often 
not align with areas of work that have increasing 
job openings. To create a labor market that works 
for the future, the Netherlands needs a “train of 
job transitions” in which multiple people learn new 
skills and shift roles to fill open needs (Exhibit E2). 
This combines lateral reskilling and upward and 
continuous development to transition workers 
into higher-productivity jobs. The annual number 
of people who need to be reskilled is projected to 
multiply by 1.4 compared to the period from 2010 
to 2020, with the average number of professions 
per career rising from 1.9 to 2.4. 

In addressing the tightness in the labor market in 
these ways, two paradoxes arise. While shortages 
should give companies incentives to onboard new 
people, train people, improve productivity, and 
implement solutions and innovations, the pressure 
caused by tightness could propel people and 
organizations in the opposite direction, resulting 
in higher obstacles to participation, more labor 
market dropouts, and less mental capacity or 
time for technological solutions. In addition, a 
tight labor market could diminish the incentives 
for workers to up- and reskill because there are 

plenty of job opportunities, while according, to 
our analysis, the rate of up- and reskilling should 
actually increase. Breaking through these 
paradoxes needs to be a priority.

What needs to happen: 
Transforming the labor market
Deliberate choices are required to build a 
future labor market with enough people and the 
right skill sets to fulfill demand and realize the 
country’s ambitions. This will require joint action 
to resolve the tightness and get the train of job 
transitions moving. Four elements are essential 
to uphold the Netherlands’ societal ambitions: 
increasing productivity, further optimizing 
participation, increasing labor market mobility, 
and enhancing people’s fitness to work. The first 
two elements quantitatively reduce overall labor 
market tightness, and the latter two ensure that 
the labor force is capable of fulfilling demand.

Increasing productivity could reduce the labor 
shortage by 85 to 90 percent, while continued 
efforts to optimize workforce participation could 
account for the remaining 10 to 15 percent. This 

4

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that workswould reduce the projected labor shortage in 2030 
from approximately 1.4 million people to 100,000 
to 200,000 and reduce labor market tightness to 
below 50 people per 100 unemployed (Exhibit E3).

Increasing productivity. To reduce labor market 
tightness, an increase in productivity is essential. 
According to our calculations, accelerating the 
adoption of technological innovations—that is, 
automation, digitalization, and traditional and 
generative AI—can quadruple productivity growth 
to 1.8 percent from 0.4 percent per year, reducing 
the labor shortage by about 1.1 million people at an 
aggregate level by 2030. This is an ambitious goal, 
but it can be achieved with substantial investments 
in people, organizations, and technology. In today’s 
tight labor market, increasing productivity through 
technological innovations has multiple advantages: 
it helps create economic growth, it makes industry 
more competitive, and it relieves tightness in 
the market, thereby reducing pressure on the 
workforce. Adoption of technological innovations 

is relevant for all sectors. On average, 15 percent of 
activities across sectors in the Netherlands could 
be automated from 2022 to 2030 in this ambitious 
yet achievable automation adoption scenario. 
Furthermore, in addition to increasing productivity 
within jobs through technological innovation, 
overall productivity in the Netherlands will also be 
increased if people move from lower-productivity 
toward higher-productivity jobs through reskilling 
and upward development.

Achieving this productivity growth through 
technological innovations will require sizable 
investments. There are indications that the current 
stagnation in labor productivity may in part be 
caused by lagging investments in R&D and labor-
reducing technologies.18 In 2022, Dutch investments 
in R&D amounted to 2.3 percent of GDP. To reach 
the EU ambition of 3 percent of GDP and keep up 
with the global playing field, the Netherlands would 
need to increase its investments in R&D by more 
than €6.7 billion annually.19

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that worksOptimizing participation. Optimizing workforce 
participation—mainly by enabling people who 
are willing and able to continue working past 
retirement age and by supporting part-time 
workers in working more hours—could build on 
the progress that has already been achieved to 
help reduce labor shortages by about 100,000 to 
200,000 people by 2030. This would be a two-
percentage-point increase on top of the three-
percentage-point increase achieved between 
2018 and 2022.20 While this impact is smaller  
than the potential of productivity increases,  
it’s an important part of the solution to the  
labor shortage.

Increasing labor market mobility. Increased 
mobility is essential to realize ambitions for 
productivity and participation and to match 
supply and demand at a granular level. The rate 
of both reskilling and upward mobility will need to 
increase, which will require structural changes as 
well as cultural change.

Three pairs of structural changes could help 
get the train of job transitions moving at speed. 
Establishing infrastructure to guide people in 
career changes and reskilling (such as regional 
work centers) and adopting skills-based 
recruitment practices could help move talent 
toward the right opportunities. Apprenticeship-
based learning approaches—to move people into 
paid work more quickly—and financial support for 
reskilling during the time spent training could help 
lift the financial hurdles inhibiting the transition 
from one job to the next. Finally, improving how 
reskilled individuals are integrated into their new 
roles and embracing continuous development in 
organizations are essential to ensure that people 
can be successful in their new jobs. 

Cultural changes are required in practices and 
thinking about work and learning. Society has 
to adapt to a new reality in which the majority 
of people will switch professions at some point 
in their working lives, perhaps more than once.

in which the majority of people  
will switch professions at some point  
in their working lives, perhaps 
more than once.

Existing initiatives do not yet have the scale or 
interconnections to solve this problem.

Enhancing fitness to work. Fitness to work is the 
ability to show up for work in good physical and 
mental shape with the appropriate skill set for the 
job. To maintain and enhance fitness to work in the 
coming decade, learning should be structurally 
embedded in each job. Our belief, based on 
discussions with a broad set of stakeholders, is 
that about 5 percent—or on average two hours 
per full-time week—of working time should be 
dedicated to learning and that this time should 
be built in as a core part of work. Furthermore, 
it remains important to safeguard the physical 
health of workers. Employers in physically 
demanding industries have a responsibility 
to maintain workers’ health—for example, by 
designing career paths that support employees 
in making timely transitions to less physically 
demanding or straining work within or outside the 
organization. Given the trend of rising stress levels, 
a focus on improving mental health is also required.

Where to start: An orchestrated  
action plan
The changes described above are significant. 
These demand new mindsets, cultures, practices, 
and infrastructure. Many initiatives to contribute 
to this transformation are already under way. At 
the same time, high labor shortages in certain 
areas that are crucial to realize societal ambitions 
are expected to remain without more targeted and 
comprehensive action at higher speed and scale.

An orchestrated action plan to address existing 
shortages in three areas of work that are critical 
to the Netherlands reaching its ambitions—skilled 
manual labor (especially for housing and the energy 
transition), digital and tech, and health and social 
care (especially in nursing and elderly care)—could 
get the train of job transitions moving.

Although the relative impact of various levers 
differs among areas of work, four levers 
stand out. First, more incentives and active 
conversations could help direct students toward 
pre-occupational education for high-demand 
professions. Second, reskilling could be a major 
source of inflow, especially into health and 
social care and skilled manual labor. Additional 
actions to lower the barrier to transition could 
include creating regional collaborations between 
organizations in search of skilled labor and those 
from adjacent sectors with labor abundance; 
scaling up public, private, and in-company 
education; and fostering collaboration between 
larger companies and small and medium-size 
enterprises. Third, developing solutions to 
improve worker retention, especially in health 
and social care—for example, through improved 
onboarding—could help ensure that new entrants 
stay long term. Finally, developing the existing 
workforce to fill demand for more advanced 
skills—for example, through collaboration with 
educational institutions or in-house academies—
could improve upward mobility.

There is an urgency to act now with speed and 
scale. The scale of the challenge requires a

next five years and beyond in which government, 
employers, employee organizations, educational 
institutions, and nongovernmental organizations 
collaborate to solve the pressing shortages 
in these three areas of work and catalyze the 
required labor market transformation toward 
2030 and beyond. 

The path that is outlined here for the Netherlands is 
no small undertaking; neither is it comprehensive. 
But it does suggest the scale of the effort and 
some of the critical steps for shifting the country’s 
approach to skills, learning, and work to ensure that 
the Netherlands remains a great place to live and 
work—today and in the future.

The Dutch labor 
market today 

Work can be a source of meaning in people’s 
everyday lives. It can make people feel that 
their efforts and talent really matter and make 
a difference to others and society. It gives 
structure to life and a path to personal growth and 
development, and it provides income to shape life 
and support family, friends, and passions.1

For many years, the Netherlands has enjoyed 
a robust economy and strong workforce. It has 
a stable and competitive market environment. 
It exports innovations and offers high-quality 
professional services and manufactured goods. 
And it is a hub for trade, financing, information 
technology, and high tech. As of 2022, the 
Netherlands had a vast working population of 9.6 
million people (out of a total population of 17.6 
million).2 This is partially enabled by a substantial 
increase in the number of women in the workforce 
since 1973 (Exhibit 1).3 In fact, the Netherlands 
has one of the highest labor force participation 
rates in the European Union,4 behind only Iceland 
and Switzerland.5 The Dutch labor market is also 

characterized by a significant share of part-time 
and independent workers (zzp’ers6); in 2022, 4.2 
million people, or 46 percent of the employed 
working-age population, worked part-time, and 
in 2023, 1.2 million people, or 13 percent of the 
employed working-age population, worked 
independently.7 For reference, within the European 
Union, 18 percent of employees work part-time and 
10 percent are classified as independent workers.8

Indeed, the Netherlands has a dynamic economy, 
a highly productive workforce, and a high-quality 
and accessible education system.9 These factors 
culminate in a great lifestyle and standard of living 
for its people: globally, the country ranks fifth for 
competitiveness,10 sixth for happiness,11 ninth for 
social progress,12 and tenth on the UN Human 
Development Index.13

However, ongoing trends—such as the aging 
population and declining productivity growth14—
could increase inequality and hinder the country’s 
ability to reach its social and economic goals.

These trends have already led to a tight labor 
market and are reshaping the workforce of the 
future, and they will lead to higher labor demand, 
especially in healthcare. However, at the same 
time, some workers will lose jobs to technological 
innovations, and in some cases, their skills will 
not align with jobs that are in increasing demand. 
Indeed, without action, the problem might not be 

a lack of jobs but a lack of people with the correct 
skills to fulfill all tasks and be more productive. In 
addition, increasing inequality between the lowest-
income group and the rest of the population,15 
the signs of declining quality of the educational 
system,16 and the increasing prevalence of mental 
and physical health issues17 put further pressure 
on the workforce. As a result, public services such

risk, societal ambitions such as the construction of 
sufficient housing and the green18 transition could 
be delayed, the country’s leading position in high-
tech industries could be at risk, and (perceived) 
inequality could grow as more people are, or feel, 
left out despite the rising demand for labor. 

This report provides an outlook on the implications 
for the 2030 Dutch labor market and the dynamics 
shaping it. Building on an earlier McKinsey 
report, A new future of work: The race to deploy 
AI and raise skills in Europe and beyond,19 it 
adds a more granular view on the Netherlands 
and suggests a pathway that could address the 

Dutch labor tightness. The report also builds on 
existing literature about the challenges facing the 
Netherlands’ workforce—including reports from 
DenkWerk, the Netherlands Bureau for Economic 
Policy Analysis (CPB), and the State Committee 
on Demographic Developments 2050.20 It shows 
that to realize a 2030 labor market that works 
for the future of the Netherlands, two levers are 
essential: increasing productivity by investing in 
technological innovation, and realizing a “train 
of job transitions” through reskilling and upward 
development to move people to the (higher-
productivity) jobs demanded. Last, it proposes 
priorities for an orchestrated action plan for three 
critical shortage areas to get the train moving.

Over the past several decades, the Dutch 
labor market has experienced some concerning 
developments. The aging population and declining 
productivity growth have already led to a tight labor 
market. Now, rising income inequality, signs of 
declining quality of education, and the increasing 
prevalence of mental and physical health issues 
are putting additional pressure on the market. If not 
addressed, these trends could have a significant 
negative impact on the overall labor market. Later 
in this chapter, we address the potential impact of 
the global trend of technological innovations—such 
as automation, digitalization, and traditional and 
generative AI (gen AI). 

Aging population due to high life expectancy and 
low birth rates. The population of the Netherlands 
is rapidly getting older. In 2010, the average age 
was 40.1; by 2022, it had reached 42.4.21 This trend 

is driven by high birth rates in the 1950s and 1960s, 
followed by persistently low birth rates since the 
1970s, as well as a higher life expectancy.22 As a 
result, the ratio of full-time-equivalent workers 
(FTEs) to people aged 67 and older has declined 
steadily since 2010 and is projected to continue to 
do so—particularly in the private sector (Exhibit 2).  
The aging population increases the pressure on 
the healthcare sector and on required state and 
private pension provisions. The private sector is 
fundamental to the government’s ability to fund its 
ambitions23—in 2023, for example, the sector was 
responsible for paying and collecting 76 percent 
of all tax and social security contributions (“sociale 
premies”) received by the Dutch government, 
totaling €293 billion (of the €386 billion collected 
in total). Thus, the declining rate of FTEs to 
people aged 67 and older puts pressure on the 
Netherlands’ earning capacity.

productivity growth was two-thirds lower in 
2010–22 than in 1995–2010, dropping from 1.3 
to 0.4 percent per year.24 This decline is in part a 
result of lower R&D investments and the shift of 
jobs from higher-productivity sectors (such as 
telecommunications and financial services) to 
lower-productivity sectors (such as healthcare 
and recreation).25 A breakdown of productivity 
development shows that public sector productivity 
has been stagnant since 2010 and that private 
sector productivity growth declined to 0.5 percent 
per year since 2010 from 1.6 percent per year from 
1995 to 2010 (Exhibit 3).

Increasing inequality in the population. Inequality 
refers to disparity in disposable income, job 
security, labor conditions, and educational 
opportunities between the lowest-income 
groups (approximately bottom 10 percent) and 
the rest of the population. This refers, for example, 
to the so-called working poor, such as home care 
professionals who work 24 hours per week earning 
as much as they would through social assistance

benefits, or people working two jobs who are 
still dependent on food banks.26 Organizations 
in the Netherlands have also increased their use 
of zzp’ers by about seven percentage points in 
the past 11 years.27 This leads to decreased job 
security and limited access to benefits such as 
social security, which is of particular concern for 
lower-income groups.28

Signs of declining quality of the educational 
system. A high-quality education is foundational 
for a productive workforce and social mobility. Yet 
from 2009 to 2022, Dutch PISA scores29 across 
basic skills (math, reading, and science) dropped 6 
to 10 percent in the Netherlands compared with 2 
to 4 percent in peer countries.30 Additionally, as a 
recent report highlighted, the rigor of the country’s 
central exams in math and science has declined in 
the past 30 years: 40 to 50 percent less content is 
covered in the math exams, and the questions on 
the exams are easier.31 In the long term, this trend 
could affect the competitive position of the Dutch 
workforce compared with peers.

Labor productivity growth in the Netherlands is slowing and has been 
stagnant in the public sector.

health issues. A healthy workforce is essential 
to the well-being of the nation and its people. In 
2023, employees in the Netherlands took an 
average of eight sick days.32 According to national 
statistics, employees in healthcare, administration, 
and education were absent most often, averaging 
nine to 11 days per year.33

Psychosocial work-related health problems 
are also rising: for example, around one in five 
working people in the Netherlands have burnout 
symptoms, up from one in seven in 2014.34 
Without intervention, experts predict this could 
increase to one in three by 2030.35 Similar trends 
are seen outside the workforce. For example, a 
recent study by RIVM found that 44 percent 
of students reported depression or anxiety 
symptoms, and similar percentages feel emotional 
exhaustion, often experience pressure to perform, 
or indicate significant stress and loneliness.36

Physical health issues also take a toll: people in 
physically demanding jobs expect to be able to 
work 1.7 years less, on average, than those whose 
jobs are not physically demanding.37 Furthermore, 
26 percent of Dutch workers (compared with 
11 percent in Europe overall) sit more than 8.5 
hours per day, which increases the chance 
of cardiovascular disease by 74 percent and 
premature death by 27 percent (compared with 
sitting less than four hours per day).38

Overall, the labor market is under pressure 
because of a combination of trends that cannot 
easily be reversed. Without action, these trends 
will persist. In the next two sections of the report, 
we explore the implications of these trends on the 
labor market and the challenges they present. 

Labor market tightness is  
likely to increase
The above trends contribute to a growing 
tightness in the labor market, meaning there 
is an increased number of job openings per 
unemployed person. Managing tightness in 
the labor market is a balancing act between 
labor supply and labor demand. Labor supply is 
driven by growth in the working-age population 
(number of people) and participation levels (hours 
worked per person). Labor demand is driven by 
the combination of increasing public and private 
demand and productivity (delivering more output 
with the same number of people). The number of 
vacancies per 100 unemployed people can be 
a proxy of labor market tightness39: the market 
could be considered increasingly tight above 50 
vacancies per 100 unemployed people.

The labor shortage could increase to  
1.4 million people
The tightness in the Dutch labor market has 
increased over the past ten years. The COVID-19 
pandemic disrupted the trend, with vacancies 
dipping and unemployment spiking, but the 
disruption did not last. By 2022, more than half 
of employers were struggling to attract new 
employees, and second quarter 2022 had the 
highest labor market tightness in the past 20 
years (Exhibit 4).40 As of first quarter 2024, there 
were 110 vacancies per 100 unemployed people. 
Besides the numerical equation, a mismatch of 
capabilities and skill requirements contributes 
to at least the perception of a tight market. We 
surveyed chief human resource officers (CHROs) 
at some of the Netherlands’ largest employers 
and found that about half are currently facing a 
labor shortage in specific areas or roles.41

Overall, the labor market is under 
pressure because of a combination of 
trends that cannot easily be reversed. 
Without action, these trends will persist.

A tight labor market with a high number of 
vacancies can be beneficial for people who 
are working or seeking work: it indicates low 
unemployment, meaning that people have 
more options in finding a job that fits with their 
ambitions. However, there are also significant 
downsides. Labor shortages can lead to a range 
of issues, such as longer wait times in healthcare, 
students being sent home when a teacher gets 
sick and there isn’t a substitute, and increased 
work pressure for those who are filling in the 
gaps.42 Thus, increasing tightness should be 
avoided, especially over longer periods of time.

If productivity growth does not increase, by 2030 
the labor shortage could increase to 1.4 million 
people and tightness could more than triple to 
a demand for 390 people per 100 unemployed 
(Exhibit 5). This increased shortage follows from 
the modeled effect of labor market developments 
toward 2030. Continued labor demand growth 
at 1.6 percent per year (following historic GDP 
growth) combined with productivity growth of 

0.4 percent per year—the average growth rates 
since 2010—increases the existing shortage by 
940,000 to 1.4 million. Societal ambitions, such as 
on healthcare, construction, high-tech industries, 
and the green transition, would further increase 
the shortage by 280,000 to 1.7 million. Finally, the 
projected labor force increase of 250,000 people—
in line with the moderate population growth 
scenario as projected by the State Committee on 
Demographic Developments 2050—reduces the 
shortage to 1.4 million people.43 If the increased 
demand can be fulfilled, it could result in a GDP 
growth of slightly more than 2 percent per year. 
Adjustment mechanisms in the economy are 
not considered. In this scenario where tightness 
triples, labor supply could hinder the country’s 
ability to grow its economy and realize its societal 
ambitions. The challenge of labor market tightness 
is not unique to the Netherlands: especially since 
the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple advanced 
economies, including Canada and the United 
States, have experienced increasing rates of 
unfilled vacancies.44

Socioeconomic choices affect the labor shortage
The socioeconomic decisions that governments 
and organizations make—in terms of policies, 
investments, and subsidies—have a significant 
impact on the Dutch economy. For instance, the 
debate over the extent to which the Netherlands 
should safeguard and stimulate the future of 
high-tech industries and advanced manufacturing 
could have a direct effect on the country’s 
competitive positioning and thus its economy 
and labor market. The choices made regarding 
11 key social and economic sectors could affect 
about one million jobs, or 10 percent of the 2030 
workforce (ranging from 550,000 fewer jobs 
to 425,000 more), resulting in a labor shortage 
anywhere from 0.9 to 1.8 million people (see 
sidebar “Topics of socioeconomic discussion”). 
While these choices would not solve the entire 
problem of structural tightness, they can create 
additional demand.

Different sectors could be affected depending 
on the choices made (Exhibit 6). For example, in 
high-tech industries and advanced manufacturing, 
limiting investments can decrease demand by 
about 100,000 people but likely at the expense 

of economic growth. On the other hand, if 
investments were to be increased, labor demand 
could be raised by approximately 75,000 
people, relative to the 2030 baseline projection, 
likely creating more economic growth but also 
increasing tightness. In healthcare, improving 
productivity through technological innovations 
or lowering the levels of care could decrease 
labor demand by about 250,000 people. In the 
logistics sector, increasing concerns about the 
impact of distribution centers on the landscape—
“verdozing”—could limit further sector growth and 
reduce labor demand for workers with basic skills.

Conscious socioeconomic choices are vital. 
Pressure is likely to force the market to settle, 
potentially on suboptimal scenarios that could 
affect multiple factors such as broad prosperity, 
labor market shortages, or economic growth. 
Market demand could decrease while public 
sector demand remains unchanged, hindering the 
nation’s capacity to create economic value. On 
the other hand, increased demand in the private 
sector could attract more talent, potentially 
magnifying shortages in the public sector (such 
as in healthcare). As a result, labor shortages in

Granular shifts in labor demand 
are likely to happen
Our projections suggest that the Dutch industry 
mix will change if productivity growth plays 
a significant role in resolving labor market 
tightness, likely requiring a comprehensive 
change in occupations, skills shifts, and capital 
reallocation.45 For example, a higher rate of 
housing construction would push demand within 
construction; geopolitical instability may lead to 
an increased focus on strategic autonomy46 and 
reshoring of industry.47

Technological innovations shift demand toward 
more advanced-skill jobs
Exhibit 7 provides a granular projection of the 
change in labor demand across occupation 
groups and skill levels in the Netherlands from 
2022 to 2030. This is based on a model from the 
McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), as also used 
in its 2024 report A new future of work: The 

race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and 
beyond.48 To understand potential changes in 
demand in each occupation, the model includes 
multiple drivers: automation adoption, the net-
zero transition, e-commerce growth, remote work 
adoption, increases in income, aging populations, 
technology investments, infrastructure investments, 
marketization of unpaid work, new jobs, and 
increased educational levels. It is important to note 
that the projected change in labor demand is based 
on the assumption of 1.8 percent productivity growth 
per year, in line with the slower Europe scenario in 
the same 2024 MGI report (see chapter 2 of this 
report for further details). In the period from 2022 
to 2030, we project 150,000 jobs to disappear in 
segments with declining demand and 400,000 
jobs to be gained in segments where employment 
increases. Overall, jobs are projected to move from 
basic- and intermediate-skill work to advance-skill 
work, particularly among knowledge workers (see 
sidebar “Defining types of work”). The sectoral 
breakdown shows that most of the increased 
demand will likely come from healthcare and social 
work (increasing by approximately 182,000 jobs), 
driven by the aging population. Wholesale and 
retail is the only sector with significant decline in

Governmental and organizational 
choices regarding key social and 
economic sectors in the economy could 
have consequences for the Dutch 
labor market. For this report, we have 
estimated the potential impact of such 
choices on labor demand and supply in 
11 sectors. Our assumptions are based 
on the perspectives publicly expressed 
in the discussions considering current 
government policy (Rutte IV), the party 
programs for the 2023 elections of 
the House of Representatives, and the 
opinions expressed in media and public 
debates. The 11 sectors are as follows:

1. High-tech and advanced manu- 
facturing. To what extent should the 
Netherlands safeguard and stimulate 
the future of high-tech and advanced 
manufacturing in the country?

2. Tech start-ups and scale-ups. To 
what extent should the Netherlands 
safeguard and stimulate the future of 
tech-heavy service companies (such as 
fintechs, tech-driven travel solutions, 

and tech-driven start-ups) that can 
easily cross borders? 

3. Logistics. To what extent should the 
logistics sector shrink, stay the same, 
or grow in the Netherlands, given the 
sector’s contributions to economic 
prosperity but also the growing 
concerns related to its impact on the 
landscape (“verdozing”)?

maintain the current number of livestock 
in the country and the current size of 
related livestock processing industries? 

8. Agriculture—horticulture. To what 
extent should the Netherlands maintain 
the current size of the horticulture 
industry in the country, given, for instance, 
its high dependence on low-paid labor? 

4. Multinationals. To what extent 
should the Netherlands safeguard the 
business climate for large multinational 
companies in the country? 

9. Healthcare. To what extent should 
the Netherlands invest in significantly 
increasing productivity, increase 
employment in the sector, or adjust 
current levels of care?

5. Energy transition. To what extent 
should the Netherlands drive the 
energy transition in the country? 

10. Public services. To what extent should 
the Netherlands expand public services 
such as police or education?

6. Carbon-intensive industries. To 
what extent should the Netherlands 
safeguard the future of carbon-
intensive industries in the country? 

11. Government. To what extent should 
the Netherlands increase or decrease 
the number of policy makers and civil 
servants? 

7. Agriculture—livestock and meat. To 
what extent should the Netherlands 

demand (decreasing by approximately 51,000 
jobs), driven by technological innovations and the 
sustained e-commerce evolution. Given the size 
of the sector, this still represents only a 3 percent 
decline compared with today. 

A closer look at the occupations within practical 
and knowledge work reveals several specific 
trends (Exhibit 8). Within practical jobs, net shifts 
are relatively low. Only 2,000 practical jobs shift 
out of the intermediate-skill category, while 
occupations that require basic- and advanced-
skill work gain jobs. Knowledge work shows a 
very large increase in demand for advanced-skill 
jobs, while demand for other skill levels declines 
compared with 2022. Healthcare workers are 
an exception to this trend, with demand set to 
increase across skill levels.

Existing shortages in three areas will continue 
to increase 
While Exhibit 7 looks at the job market through 
a lens of industry and skill level, it is important 
to also examine shifts in the market from an 
occupational lens, as this will determine the need 
for reskilling. For example, the healthcare and 
social work sector includes doctors and nurses 
but also nonclinical roles, such as a financial 
controller for a hospital. These occupations 
will be affected differently in the coming years. 
Therefore, we created areas of work by combining 
similar occupation groups that stretch across 
sectors and skill levels. Specifically, the focus is 
on five areas of work that are affected most or are 
facing high shortages. Skilled manual labor, digital 
and tech jobs, and health and social care are the 
areas facing shortages, while our projections

Defining types of work

We have divided occupations into two 
categories: predominantly practical 
work, which includes trade jobs, 
services, and creative professionals 
(such as order pickers, police officers, 
and welders), and knowledge 
work, which includes desk jobs and 

healthcare services (such as call-
center workers, logistical planners, 
and doctors). We also classified 
each occupation by skill level (basic, 
intermediate, or advanced) based on 
workers’ level of education, experience 
needed, and risk involved. For example,  

a paver would be classified in basic 
skills, the project planner for the 
reconstruction of the street in 
intermediate skills, and the urban 
planner designing the future outlook of 
the city in advanced skills.

suggest that jobs in basic- to intermediate-level 
business professions and predictive manual labor 
could decline. Inflow in the latter is currently high, 
and slowing inflow over the next several years 
could gradually decrease the number of people for 
these jobs, thus avoiding significant oversupply of 
people. We expect the first three areas of work to 
experience continued shortages.

Skilled manual labor. This group includes 
pipelayers, electricians, sheet metal workers, 
and other skilled workers. We project that by 
2030, this group will experience a shortage of 
100,000 people, which is 16 percent of 2030 

demand in this area of work. There is already a 
shortage of these workers, but the projected 
2030 shortage is about two times higher than the 
current vacancies.49 This is caused by an increase 
in demand (partly because of the green transition) 
combined with an expected net outflow caused by 
(early) retirements because of the physical strain 
of the work and the relatively advanced age of the 
working population. 

Digital and tech. We project this group of 
workers, including computer hardware engineers, 
statisticians, mathematicians, network architects, 
and data scientists, to face a 2030 shortage of 

22

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that worksabout 105,000 people, which is 10 percent of 
2030 demand in this area of work. While there is a 
net inflow of people into the area of work, demand 
is expected to rise more rapidly than the inflow. 
Future shortages therefore will be about four 
times higher than current vacancies.50

Health and social care. We project that by  
2030, this group of doctors, nurses, and other 
health- and social-care workers will experience  
a shortage of about 245,000 people—16 percent  
of 2030 demand in this area of work. The 
shortage is therefore approximately eight times 
higher than current vacancies.51 This is caused 
by an increase in demand (due to the aging 
population) combined with an expected net 
outflow caused by high attrition (partly because 
of high work pressure).

A train of job transitions is needed 
Historically, there have been many moments when 
a large number of jobs needed to be filled—for 
instance, around the year 2000, in response to 
large-scale adoption of online technologies.52 
New entrants into the job market have always 
played a significant role in filling such vacancies. 
Typically, these new entrants include recent 
graduates, older new entrants or reentrants to the 
labor market, and labor migrants. 

In the coming years, filling vacancies will depend 
less on new entrants and more on internal labor 
market mobility, either within an organization 
or between employers. In 2021, approximately 
110,000 new graduates and approximately 
60,000 qualified labor migrants entered the 
workforce.53 In 2030, the number of students 
leaving education is expected to remain stable 
while labor migration may be 35 percent 
lower, in line with the moderate labor migration 
scenario proposed by the State Committee on 
Demographic Developments 2050. Because the 
inflow is therefore likely to decline rather than 
increase in the coming years, it might become 
more difficult to meet the shifting demand.

According to our projections, by 2030, the 
equivalent of roughly 1.5 million jobs could be 
displaced in a scenario of increased productivity 
growth due to automation, corresponding to 
approximately 180,000 displacements per year. 
Between 2010 and 2020, there have been, on 
average, 210,000 switches of professional 

class per year (2.2 percent of the workforce). 
Assuming that the displacements by automation 
are additional to this historic level and that half of 
the people in these displaced jobs would need to 
switch professional class or develop upwards, we 
project the resulting number of annual switches 
in the labor market to increase to 300,000 per 
year (3.1 percent of the workforce).54 As a result, 
the number of people to be reskilled and upward 
developed would multiply by 1.4. This means 
that, going forward, a worker would spend, on 
average, 24 years in a profession and hence have 
2.4 professions during their career (switching 
professions 1.4 times per career). In comparison, 
this same worker in the period from 2010 to 2020 
would spend 27 years in a profession and have 1.9 
professions per career (or 0.9 switches) (Exhibit 9).

This increased switching rate could be explained 
by the fact that labor oversupply and shortages 
expected for 2030 do not match one-to-one: 
the people whose jobs disappear cannot move 
directly into new jobs because the new jobs 
will require different skills or skill levels. This 
is reflected in our survey of CHROs; about 60 
percent indicated they face skills mismatches 
today, and 65 percent expect this challenge 
to worsen in the future. Indeed, the projected 
oversupplies and shortages are expected  
to continue to grow beyond 2030 as the  
drivers—aging population and low birth rate,  
the green transition, and technological 
innovations—persist. 

Solving this mismatch therefore requires a “train 
of job transitions” in which multiple people 
learn new skills and shift roles to fill open needs. 
Instead of one person transitioning directly from 
an area of oversupply to one with shortages, 
which might be a big leap, several people make 
a transition to an adjacent area of work, creating 
a “train” from the area with oversupply to the one 
with shortages. We address how to get this train 
running in parts II and III of this report.

The paradoxes of pressure and 
tightness in the labor market
All of the above challenges, except the role 
of socioeconomic choices, imply a need for 
improved productivity, optimized participation, 
skills shifts, improved physical and mental 
health, and an improved healthy lifespan. But

these factors also indicate a paradox. While 
there is a need to onboard and train new people, 
improve productivity and pursue other workforce 
solutions, and invest in skill shifts and health,  
this is not always possible because it also takes 
time and effort from people who are already 
short on time. 

illness, or other special circumstances—into the 
workforce or into society in other ways, such 
as through volunteering. More people might be 
left behind and unable to contribute to the labor 
market, leaving untapped potential on the table. 
This could also cause more inequality and have 
negative health implications. 

Tightness in the labor market also means people’s 
workloads in sectors or roles with labor shortages 
are increased for prolonged periods—that is, they 
have to do the same work, or even more, while 
there are fewer workers. Increased workload is a 
risk factor for employee health. When people are 
overworked, they are more likely to miss days or 
leave their work, leading to increased workloads 
for the remaining people.55

In parallel, workers might not feel the need 
to re- or upskill, because a tight labor market 
provides at least the perception of enough job 
opportunities. At the same time, our projections 
suggest the rate of up- and reskilling should 
actually increase to keep the train of job 
transitions moving. While this is important on a 
market-wide level, incentives at the individual 
level might not be aligned. 

This paradox makes it challenging to relieve 
labor market pressure. In addition, worker 
shortages also lead to fewer resources to help 
integrate people who are distanced from the labor 
market—including people with disabilities, chronic 

Addressing these paradoxes is paramount to 
keeping the workforce fit for work and resolving 
the challenges of supply and demand. Finding a 
pathway to do so will require clear prioritization, 
alignment, and vision.

The projections and challenges above position 
the Netherlands at a turning point. Deliberate 
choices and coordinated initiatives are required 
to build a future labor market that can realize all 
societal ambitions. In this part of the report, we 
suggest a pathway for the Netherlands to relieve 
the tightness and maintain societal ambitions. 
Four elements must be addressed: increasing 
productivity, further optimizing participation, 
increasing labor market mobility, and enhancing 
people’s fitness to work (Exhibit 10). The first 
two elements solve the quantitative challenge of 
reducing overall labor market tightness, while the 
latter two elements ensure that the labor force 
is capable of doing the jobs in demand. In this 
report, we touch on each of these elements, but we 
pay particular attention to labor productivity and 
improving mobility through a train of job transitions, 
given the importance of these two elements on  
the future labor market.

Relieving labor market tightness 
Curbing demand could help solve the tightness, 
but it would have a negative effect on GDP growth 
and jeopardize the societal ambitions outlined at 
the start of this report. If the Netherlands were to 
sustain its current productivity growth rate of 0.4 
percent per year and projected labor force growth 
rate of 0.3 percent per year,56 GDP growth would 
likely drop to 0.7 percent per year from 1.6 percent 

Web <2024>

Exhibit 10
Exhibit <9> of <16>

per year over the past ten years. Reducing GDP 
growth to 1 percent per year would lead to a sharp 
increase of the Dutch annual budget deficit to 
approximately 5 percent per year (well above the 
EU-agreed 3 percent rule) and a debt ratio of more 
than 60 percent of GDP.57 This would therefore 
directly affect the country’s welfare and its ability to 
achieve its ambitions. 

Resolving tightness only through optimized labor 
market participation, while maintaining current 
productivity and fulfilling labor demand growth, 
would require the equivalent of 1.4 million additional 
workers by 2030. Resolving the labor market 
tightness through increased productivity would 
require productivity growth to increase to 2.0 
percent per year (up from 0.4 percent per year 
since 2010).

A feasible pathway could combine increasing 
productivity and optimizing labor participation 
while upholding the Netherlands’ societal ambition 
level. Increasing productivity by accelerating 
the adoption of technological innovations could 
account for 85 to 90 percent of the country’s ability 
to reduce the labor shortage at an aggregate 
level. Continued efforts to increase workforce 
participation could account for the remaining 10 to  
15 percent. This would reduce the projected labor 
shortage in 2030 from approximately 1.4 million 
people (as described in chapter 1) to 100,000 to  

Four critical areas could help the Netherlands shape a productive, mobile, 
healthy, and inclusive labor market.

to a demand for less than 50 people per 100 
unemployed people (Exhibit 11). 

Increasing labor productivity through technology 
Accelerating the adoption of technological 
innovations—that is, automation, digitalization, 
and traditional and generative AI—can quadruple 
productivity growth to 1.8 percent from 0.4 percent 
per year, reducing labor shortages by about 1.1 
million people at an aggregate level by 2030. This 
productivity increase can be achieved both within 
jobs (through automation) and by people moving into 
more productive jobs. In today’s tight labor market, 
increasing productivity through technological 
innovations has multiple advantages: it helps 
create economic growth, it makes industry more 
competitive, and it relieves the tightness in the 
market, thereby reducing pressure on the workforce. 

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and 
raise skills in Europe and beyond, a recent report 
from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), models 
four scenarios for productivity growth in Europe. 
The key differentiator in these scenarios is the 
speed at which technological innovations are 
adopted in the labor market; all scenarios assume 

that worker time saved because of automation is 
redeployed in the labor market. The productivity 
growth of 1.8 percent per year assumed in this report 
is in line with MGI’s slower Europe scenario. From 
a historical perspective, 1.8 percent productivity 
growth per year seems ambitious yet achievable, as 
the Netherlands reported 1.3 percent productivity 
growth per year from 1995 to 2010.58 However, 
even with the required investments, productivity 
increase is not a given, as the Netherlands saw 
a lower productivity increase of 0.4 percent per 
year between 2010 and 2022 despite technology 
innovations such as the internet.59

Adoption of technological innovations is relevant 
for all sectors (Exhibit 12). This analysis is based 
on an MGI model that breaks down some 850 
occupations into about 2,100 constituent activities 
and then determines the adoption rate based on 
the automation potential of a set of 18 capabilities. 
In the slower Europe scenario, an average of 
15 percent of activities across sectors in the 
Netherlands could be automated—such as order 
picking in warehouses. The highest automation 
potential, at 18 percent, is expected in financial 
services, insurance, and real estate, as well as 
manufacturing, energy, materials, and utilities; for

example, robotics and automation systems could 
streamline production processes. The automation 
potential in healthcare is estimated to be lower, 
at 11 percent; while adopting automation to this 
extent would be challenging, it is not sufficient to 
offset the increased demand for care, resulting in 
the increased demand and shortages discussed in 
chapter 1. The largest opportunity for automation is 
in wholesale and retail, professional and knowledge 
services, and healthcare and social services. 

Achieving this productivity growth through 
technological innovations requires sizable 
investments. The Dutch Central Planning 
Agency (CPB) sees indications that the current 
stagnating labor productivity may in part be due 
to lagging investments in R&D and labor-reducing 
technologies.60 In 2022, Dutch investments in 
R&D amounted to 2.3 percent of GDP. To reach 
the EU ambition of 3 percent of GDP and keep 

up with the global playing field, the Netherlands 
would need to invest more than €6.7 billion 
more in R&D annually.61 The private sector 
would likely be the dominant investor in these 
efforts, both materially and in capabilities, given 
that productivity is critical to stay competitive. 
Increased productivity through technological 
innovations is also critical for the public sector—
arguably even more so, given that productivity has 
been stagnant for decades, according to national 
statistics.62 The public sector is not driven by the 
same market forces as the private sector and 
hence requires alternative stimuli to reach the 
same outcome. 

The government could potentially accelerate 
technological innovation through regulatory 
action—both by creating incentives for investments 
(for example, to increase the attractiveness

to improve (cyber)security and safety. This can 
build on existing efforts such as the National 
Growth Fund (Nationale Groeifonds) project AiNed, 
which aims to grow a strong AI ecosystem in the 
Netherlands by 2027 to make the country more 
competitive with international peers.63

and 2022.65 While this action would have a smaller 
impact than productivity increases, it is still an 
important factor in solving the challenges facing 
the Dutch labor market. These efforts could focus 
on increasing both the number of hours and years 
people work and the overall number of people in 
the workforce (Exhibit 13).

For organizations to successfully execute the 
required technological innovation, simply investing 
in technology is not enough. McKinsey research 
shows that the value of digital transformations 
comes from careful and coordinated execution 
across all focus areas in an organization, including 
a business-led digital road map aligned on 
value, the right talent and capabilities, and an 
effective operating model to deliver on the digital 
ambition.64 Given the rapid pace of technological 
developments, a transformation is not about 
mastering one use case completely. It’s about 
building a minimum-viable use case; piloting, 
improving, and scaling it; and then repeating the 
process for use case after use case. This requires a 
major step up for most organizations.

In addition to increasing productivity within jobs, 
technological innovations will boost productivity in 
the Netherlands overall if people move from lower-
productivity to higher-productivity jobs through 
reskilling and upward development. We elaborate 
on this mobility in later sections of this report.

Optimizing workforce participation 
Building on progress that has already been made, 
optimizing participation in the workforce could 
help reduce labor shortages by about 100,000 to 
200,000 people by 2030. This would be a two-
percentage-point increase on top of the three-
percentage-point increase achieved between 2018 

More years. The largest contribution could likely 
come from supporting people who are willing 
and able to continue working beyond retirement 
age. From 2013 to 2023, the number of people 
aged 67 and over participating in the labor market 
doubled. Although 82 percent of these individuals 
worked part-time, this shift resulted in about 
120,000 additional FTEs in 2022.66 Sustaining this 
growth would result in approximately 60,000 to 
110,000 more workers by 2030. Additionally, this 
could improve health, as people who stay active 
longer are more likely to report better health.67 
The Netherlands could take inspiration here from 
New Zealand: in 2022, according to OECD data, 
25 percent of New Zealanders 65 and older were 
participating in the workforce, compared with 11 
percent in the Netherlands.68 According to New 
Zealand’s Retirement Commission policy lead, 
the country implemented a range of measures 
to encourage older people to continue to work, 
including eliminating a mandatory retirement age.69

More hours. Efforts to increase workers’ hours may 
be best suited to sectors with relatively low average 
hours worked per week, including education and 
healthcare.70 Several initiatives already focus on this, 
such as Het Potentieel Pakken, a nongovernmental 
organization (NGO) that works with organizations—
mostly in sectors with many part-time workers—to 
optimize for labor shortages and support employees’ 
(financial) well-being. For example, the NGO helps 

Building on progress that has already 
been made, optimizing participation  
in the workforce could help reduce labor 
shortages by about 100,000 to 200,000  
people by 2030.

organizations resolve obstacles in scheduling, 
allowing people to work fewer but longer shifts 
instead of several shorter ones. Rules and timing are 
clear, so employees are better able to balance work 
with their personal lives, and team collaboration is 
increased. The results of Het Potentieel Pakken’s 
projects show that with the new scheduling, about 10 
percent of employees increased their contracts with 
an average of five hours per week. Extrapolating 
this result for all part-time workers in the Dutch 
workforce could add the equivalent of 50,000 to 
80,000 people by 2030.

In addition to reducing labor shortages, practical 
improvements such as better scheduling and collab- 
oration can also increase labor satisfaction. This can 
in turn improve productivity and reduce absences 
from work, contributing to people’s fitness to work. 

participation by at most 1 to 2 percent (out of a 
nonworking population of 1.5 million)—because 
optimizing the participation of nonworkers remains 
challenging. To help them enter or reenter the labor 
market would require sufficient support and specific 
interventions, such as for those who currently 
have a caregiver role or who are unemployed 
due to illness or disability. This potential does not 
account for further reductions in the unemployment 
rate, because the aforementioned group is likely 
currently not actively looking for employment and 
is therefore not included in the unemployment 
statistics. Increasing labor migration in general 
could help, as the State Committee on Demographic 
Developments 2050 points out, but doing so  
could also lead to increased pressure on (public) 
services in the long term (see sidebar “The role of 
labor migration”).71

More people. Facilitating and motivating people who 
are currently not looking for work to enter or reenter 
the labor force could help reduce labor shortages 
by 15,000 to 30,000 people by 2030. The potential 
is assumed to be relatively small—it would increase 

One source of talent could be ethnocultural 
minority individuals (EMIs), according to a recent 
McKinsey report.72 EMIs represent 17 percent of 
the Dutch workforce, but on average, they are more 
likely than the nonminority population to be out of 

32

More yearsMore hoursMore peopleTotal60–11050–8015–30125–220Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that worksthe labor market. The unemployment rate is higher 
for non-western EMIs (7 percent) compared with 
native citizens (3 percent), while their labor market 
participation rate is lower (71 percent) than that 
of native citizens (75 percent). Greater inclusion 
of EMIs could be a triple win—spurring growth for 
companies by addressing talent gaps, boosting 
economic empowerment of EMIs and their families, 
and delivering benefits for the economy and wider 
society in economic inclusion and social cohesion.

Employers can play a role in all of the above 
initiatives by taking a targeted approach to 
understanding their (potential) employees’ needs 
and offering work packages and schedules 
that meet those needs. It is also important 
for employers and society at large to address 
societal prejudices that limit groups (such as older 
employees)73 from participating in the labor force.

Ensuring a fit and mobile workforce
The many shifts expected in the labor market in 
the coming years will require the workforce to be 
adaptable. Because every individual is needed 
in the labor market, people will need to learn a 
new profession more often than they do today. 
Structural changes are needed to increase market 
mobility and help people stay fit for work—in terms 
of both skills and mental and physical health. 

Increasing labor market mobility 
The labor market requires high levels of mobility, 
both vertically and horizontally, for productivity 
growth and to solve the mismatch between 
oversupply and shortages of labor expected for 
2030 and beyond. In chapter 1 of this report, we 
introduced the notion that people will need to 
reskill 1.4 times more often and that a “train of  
job transitions” would be required.

In addition, optimized participation must be financially  
beneficial to work. In a survey of 1,300 people in the 
Dutch working population, the Dutch National Bank 
found that one in three people would be willing to 
work more if the rewards were higher.74 At the same 
time, increased wages—especially for lower-paid 
jobs—could help reduce inequality and encourage 
investments in technological innovations, which are 
necessary to relieve the pressure on the market.

Higher mobility in the labor market could set the 
required train of job transitions in motion to address 
these mismatches through two pathways (Exhibit 14).  
“Lateral entrants” from adjacent job categories 
and relevant industries would switch jobs to fill 
open positions. Some of these people might 
transfer directly from industries with oversupply, 
while others may flow in from industries without 
oversupply, thus requiring those positions to also 

The role of labor migration

In this report, labor force growth 
projections take into account the mid 
scenario for labor migration from the 
State Committee on Demographic 
Developments 2050, which indicates 
average net migration of 68,000 people 
per year between 2022 and 2050.1 This 
is similar to net migration in 2014–18 and 
lower than the rate from 2019 to 2023. 
The latter years saw an average net 
migration of 130,000 per year, mainly 
driven by the war in Ukraine.2 

A recent publication by the State 
Committee on Demographic 

Developments 2050 states labor 
migration could be an effective solution 
to relieve labor market tightness and 
generate high-quality knowledge 
migration. At the same time, the State 
Committee also states that labor 
migration could increase societal 
pressures—for instance, on the housing 
market—if employers do not provide 
these services. This is especially true 
for sectors that exist primarily because 
of the availability of people working in 
low-paid occupations. According to the 
State Committee, labor migration can 
therefore not be the sole solution for 

labor market tightness that is caused 
by the aging population.3

development,” which involves preparing people 
to fulfill more advanced-skilled jobs within their 
occupation. Given the increasing demand for 
advanced-skilled work, gaps at higher skill levels 
would be filled through continuous development  
of workers.

support for reskilling during training could alleviate 
the financial hurdles preventing people from 
moving from one job to the next. Finally, improving 
how reskilled individuals are integrated into their 
new roles and embracing continuous development 
in organizations are essential to ensure that people 
can become successful in their new jobs.

Structural changes to the labor market are required 
to avoid a situation where there is enough labor 
supply but a lack of the right skill sets. Other 
organizations—for instance, DenkWerk and De 
Buitenboordmotor—have also published on this 
topic.75 Here, we highlight three pairs of changes 
that could help get the train of job transitions 
moving at speed.

Establishing infrastructure to support career 
changes (such as regional work centers) and 
adopting skills-based recruitment practices 
could help attract talent to the right opportunities. 
Apprenticeship-based learning approaches—to 
move people faster into paid work—and financial 

Establish infrastructure to support career changes. 
Typically, workers have to figure out pathways to 
career changes on their own. In contrast, pre-
occupational skilling offers highly supported 
pathways, including discussions with teachers, 
open house visits, and clear steps to follow. A 
broad societal approach in which public and private 
organizations join forces can help establish the 
required infrastructure for guidance and education. 
For example, the government recently allocated 
funding to scale regional work centers (RWC), 
which bring together national agencies, local 
government, and private labor market players in 
each region to provide guidance and support.76

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that worksAdopt skills-based recruitment practices. Lateral 
entrants face difficulties finding employment 
because established hiring practices often 
favor experience in the field of work. This is 
despite evidence suggesting that hiring based 
on skills assessment is twice as predictive of 
job performance than hiring based on work 
experience in the same field.77 Employers should 
hire applicants based on their experience and 
motivation, viewing job transitions as a promising 
sign of their ability to learn new skills and adapt, 
and take responsibility in developing existing 
employees to keep their skills relevant and allow 
them to grow. For example, Arbeidsmatchplatform, 
a collaborative effort by seven large companies 
active in the energy sector, aims to fill jobs in skilled 
manual labor by selecting people primarily on their 
skills and less on their prior education, making 
it easier for people without a background in the 
sector to find suitable jobs in this area of work.78

Adopt apprenticeship-based learning approaches. 
Existing initiatives demonstrate the benefits of 
apprenticeship programs (“leerwerktrajecten”) 
for people who switch roles mid-career. In this 
approach, workers spend less time in the classroom 
and more time learning on the job. Moreover, 
throughout our interviews we saw a preference for 
a more apprenticeship-based learning approach, in 
which new entrants learn a basic set of skills on a 
narrow set of tasks and the expand their skills while 
progressing on the job. This also allows people to 
join or rejoin the labor force more quickly. 

Support reskilling financially. People who 
are reskilling mid-career often have financial 
responsibilities, such as a family or a mortgage, and 
cannot risk the salary decrease that is common 
during the reskilling period. Even in a combined 
learning and working approach, the lack of 
funding for work-to-work transitions is a barrier.79 
People given the opportunity to reskill mention 
this financial gap as a key barrier that inhibits the 
rate of reskilling. For example, during the COVID-
19 pandemic, HR and staffing service provider 
Randstad contacted 13,000 temporary workers 
whose contracts had been terminated. Half of these 
workers received an offer to reskill, but only about 
1,000 people accepted the offer. Concerns about a 
temporary loss of income were reported as one of 
the main reasons for not accepting the offer.80

Integrate reskilled individuals in their new roles. 
Employers should adapt their organizational 
infrastructure to smoothly integrate reskilled people 
in their new occupation. For example, secondary 
vocational (“middelbaar beroepsonderwijs” or 
“MBO”) teachers who start teaching later in their 
careers experience high work pressure during 
their first years, and a third of them leave the sector. 
There is opportunity to improve the support in 
this crucial phase.81 Because of the shortages, 
time and support for on-the-job training and 
development may be limited. Tailored learning and 
development plans for lateral entrants should be 
prioritized, but few exist.

Embrace continuous development in organizations. 
The train of job transitions only works if there is 
sufficient upward mobility in the market. Employers 
have a responsibility to continue developing 
employees and providing pathways to the next 
opportunity. This will require structural changes 
to embed learning and development into the 
work rhythm of all employees. The effect of this 
is threefold: it improves mobility and therefore 
enables the train of job transitions, it improves the 
adaptability of employees and organizations, and it 
helps realize the required productivity improvement 
described earlier. 

In addition to the above three pairs of changes, 
organizations need a cultural change in behavior 
and thinking about work and learning to keep 
the train of job transitions on track. Employers, 
government, and employees have to adapt to a new 
reality in which the majority of people will switch 
professions in their working lives, perhaps even 
more than once. Employees could also benefit 
from an apprenticeship-based mindset in their 
(pre-occupational) education and training, as this 
mindset makes them more mobile and less bound 
to a specific job or industry.82

Enhancing people’s ‘fitness to work’ 
“Fitness to work” is the ability to go to work in good 
physical and mental health with the appropriate 
skills to do the job. Ensuring work is beneficial 
and not harmful to health is important to reduce 
labor force dropouts and increase productivity 
and adaptability, which decreases pressure on 
the labor market. Investments to ensure fitness to 
work are particularly relevant in sectors with high 

35

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that workslabor shortages, such as healthcare, because they 
will benefit both individual well-being and overall 
productivity improvement. 

Skill fitness. “Skill fitness” refers to the alignment 
of workers’ skills with skills that are in demand 
and to their ability to learn new skills. Ensuring 
skill fitness has been a topic of conversation in the 
Netherlands for years—not only because such 
fitness enables workers to effectively do their jobs 
but also because workers value the opportunity 
to learn. With the future needs of the workforce 
changing at a rapid pace, the importance of 
continuous development is only increasing. 
Developing new skills not only enables people to 
apply those specific skills but also trains their ability 
to learn. This experience makes their skill sets more 
adaptable for future needs. Our research indicates 
that technological innovations such as automation, 
digitalization, and traditional and generative AI will 
substantially change the demand for certain skill 
sets in the coming decade, increasing the total 
number of work hours spent on technological and 
social and emotional skills while reducing the hours 
of work on basic cognitive skills.83

Employers have been exploring training 
opportunities for years, but significant improve- 
ments can still be made on the institutional level 
to make them more effective. The participation 
rate for employee trainings in the Netherlands 
is approximately three percentage points lower 
than the average (42.4 percent) for selected peer 
countries,84 despite 86.0 percent higher spending 
on continuous vocational courses than peers.85 In 
our survey of CHROs of large Dutch companies, 
88 percent indicated that they offer trainings for 
employees to continuously develop and learn various 
skills. However, only 33 percent said their trainings 
are having the intended effect, and 64 percent 
indicated that their employee training efforts could 
be ten times more effective than they are currently. 
Smaller enterprises, on the other hand, might lack 
the scale and professional HR to implement skills 
development infrastructure in the first place.

To maintain and enhance skill fitness in the coming 
decade, learning should be embedded structurally 
in each job. Our belief, based on discussions 
with a broad set of stakeholders, is that about 5 
percent—or on average two hours per full-time 
week—of working time should be dedicated to 
learning and that this time should be built in as a 

core part of work. This is an organizational and 
individual responsibility. Based on our experience, 
we observe four elements that help improve the 
effectiveness of learning. First, organizations need 
to embed learning in their DNA by setting annual, 
monthly, or even weekly objectives for employees; 
considering these objectives in formal review 
processes; tracking the impact of learning activities 
and celebrating and role-modeling learning 
behavior. Second, employers should provide 
direction on what their employees should learn, 
in line with the future needs of the organization. 
Third, employers should create learning pathways 
for different employee segments within their 
organization. Finally, they should ensure that 
learning is directly embedded into daily tasks 
by blending learning into daily work activities—
so-called learning on the job—which also requires 
consistent and frequent coaching and feedback. 

Physical fitness. Across all industries, it is 
important to safeguard the physical health of 
workers and ensure that work does not harm 
their health—whether from hard physical labor 
and repeated movements or from excessive 
time spent sitting. Specific focus should be on 
physically demanding jobs that people typically 
cannot sustain all the way to retirement age. As 
the retirement age rises, this challenge is likely to 
grow. While technological innovations to improve 
productivity may contribute to reducing the 
physical strain of certain jobs, they will not fully 
eliminate the burden. Early retirement cannot be 
the only solution in these industries. People can 
still contribute to society later in their careers, and 
many are eager to do so. For example, firefighters’ 
employers and unions in the Netherlands recently 
agreed to change a forced 20-year retirement 
policy to be voluntary. Ideally, multiple paths 
would be available for such workers. Employers 
offering physically demanding jobs should take 
responsibility for maintaining workers’ health 
by alleviating physical strain and by designing 
opportunities to transition to less physically 
demanding or straining work within or outside  
the organization. Employees with physically 
straining jobs should be able to make timely use  
of available alternatives.

Mental fitness. Declining mental health is a 
broad societal problem that also profoundly 
affects the labor market. TNO expects stress 
on working people to increase in the coming 20 

36

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that worksyears, demanding an integrated approach by the 
government, healthcare systems, educational 
systems, and employers.86 This issue won’t 
be solved through a handful of best practices. 
However, previous research from the McKinsey 
Health Institute shows that employers have 
considerable opportunities to improve employee 
mental health through six modifiable drivers 
that focus on creating a positive and meaningful 

(social) environment at work, reducing and 
managing stress, and supporting employees to 
uphold a healthy and financially secure lifestyle.87 
The government also has a role to play—for 
example, by raising the visibility of this issue, 
focusing more on prevention, and offering tools 
to improve mental health, as outlined in the Dutch 
government’s “Approach to mental health for all of 
us” initiative.88

Strengthening the Dutch labor market through 
the four areas outlined in the previous section— 
productivity, participation, labor market mobility, 
and fitness—requires a sizable transformation. A 
“train of job transitions” should be set in motion, as 
we highlighted in the previous section. Building 
a labor market with higher mobility and more 
flexibility demands new mindsets, cultures, 
practices, and infrastructure, all of which take time 
to develop. Yet there is an urgency to act now with 
speed and scale, because the tightness in the 
labor market and the scale of national ambitions 
require immediate action. By 2030, 980,000 new 
houses need to be built.89 CO2 emissions need to 
be reduced by at least 55 percent compared with 
1990 levels.90 And the aging population will boost 
healthcare needs. Even today, the expansion of the 
electricity grid is not keeping up with increasing 
demand,91 the government is unable to execute its 
own policy because of labor shortages,92 and a lack 
of skilled IT professionals is limiting the ability of 
companies to grow their business.93

An orchestrated action plan is 
needed for three areas of work
It is crucial that all organizations—private and 
public—focus on realizing more growth in 
productivity through technological innovation to 
alleviate the tightness on an aggregate level. At 
the same time, high labor shortages in certain 
areas that are crucial to realize the aforementioned 
societal ambitions are expected to remain, unless 
more targeted and comprehensive action at higher 
speed and scale is taken to address shortages in 
three areas of work in particular: skilled manual 
labor (particularly for the housing and energy 
transition), digital and tech jobs (particularly 
advanced jobs), and health and social care 
(particularly for nursing and elderly care). Our 
projections indicate that in 2030, the Netherlands 
could face shortages in these areas of 100,000, 
105,000, and 245,000 people, respectively. The 
challenges in these three areas of work are not 
unknown, and many initiatives have already been 
taken to resolve them. However, each of these 
areas could benefit from a more collaborative, 
better orchestrated approach. For example, in the 
healthcare sector, many initiatives already exist to 
address partial elements of the challenge—such as 
optimizing participation (by Het Potentieel Pakken) 
and encouraging lateral inflow (by ZorgStart).94 At 
the same time, the inflow of MBO and HBO students 

in nursing dropped by about 25 percent from 2021 
to 2023, putting additional pressure on the sector 
in the next one to four years.95

The scale of the challenge requires a compre- 
hensive, orchestrated plan for the next five years 
and beyond through which government, employers, 
employee organizations, educational institutions, 
and NGOs all work together to solve the pressing 
shortages in these three areas of work, and 
catalyze the required labor market transformation 
toward 2030 and beyond.

On top of productivity growth, there are seven 
solution levers: giving more hours to part-time 
workers, increasing work beyond retirement age, 
expanding net inflow through pre-occupational 
skilling, reskilling, retention, upward development, 
and labor migration. The order of importance 
differs across the three areas of work. However, 
for the three areas of work we focus on, four levers 
are most critical to address: pre-occupational 
skilling, reskilling, retention, and upward 
development (Exhibit 15).

Pre-occupational skilling
An efficient labor market exhibits a healthy balance 
between the available skill sets of the labor force 
and the skill demands of the market. Currently, the 
inflow of people to the labor market is unbalanced, 
creating unnecessarily high variance in job 
prospects in different areas of work. Industry 
groups, in collaboration with employers and 
educational institutions, are already organizing 
marketing campaigns to promote education and 
jobs in areas with high market demand.96 Further 
orchestration is essential to rebalance the inflow. 
Educational institutions could engage more 
effectively with prospective students to make 
them aware of job opportunities in their areas of 
interest and potentially guide them toward fields 
with higher market demand. Government and 
employers in high-demand sectors could consider 
expediting the process by offering incentives—
such as scholarships and grants or housing 
support in locations with housing shortages—for 
certain types of education. As a last resort, 
measures could be considered to limit enrollment 
in areas of study with lower market demand 
through mechanisms such as a “numerus fixus.”

Pre-occupational skilling is a particularly promising 
solution to address shortages in advanced

digital and tech jobs, as indicated in Exhibit 12, 
by addressing a younger generation that has 
grown up with digital and tech. For example, 
Codam Coding College in Amsterdam offers 
an accessible software development program 
to a large and diverse group of people who are 
not as easily reached by traditional education.97 
Taking a broader perspective on required skills and 
adopting alternative educational methods could be 
particularly effective to increase inflow into this area.

Promoting pre-occupational education to foreign 
students could be an additional solution for these 
shortage areas. For example, barriers to entry for 
people who don’t speak Dutch are lower for certain 
digital and tech jobs compared with some other 
areas of work such as healthcare. 

Reskilling 
In addition to making sure new entrants to the 
job market have the right skills, it is necessary 
to reskill the existing labor force. Reskilling 
could be a major source of inflow into positions 
requiring more basic skills in skilled manual labor 

and health and social care, as opposed to digital, 
which requires a more advanced skill level. With 
appropriate reskilling, workers could move to 
shortage areas from other areas. Adjacent skill 
sets in other areas of work can be found in many 
sectors, both in the same company as well as in 
completely different industries.

Major companies in areas of labor abundance—for 
example, those considering reorganizations—
could make agreements with companies (or 
groups of companies) with shortages, making 
it easy for workers to find new opportunities 
in adjacent work areas. For example, Techniek 
Coalitie Limburg supports skilled manual 
laborers who were let go by VDL Nedcar in 
finding new jobs at partner companies.98 As this 
transition typically does not occur automatically, 
government could consider accelerating the 
transition by orchestrating, promoting, and 
providing incentives for such collaborations.

Educational institutions are already working on 
reskilling for lateral inflow, but not at the scale 

41

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that worksneeded and not at the maturity of pre-occupational 
education. Public, private, and in-company 
educators could support these efforts by further 
including reskilling studies in their education 
offerings. For example, FastSwitch provides 
shortened reskilling trajectories at universities of 
applied sciences (HBO) for in-demand jobs, such as 
nurses, engineering work planners, and software 
developers.99 The organization also provides—or 
helps people find—jobs with partner employers, 
where new hires will continue learning on the 
job. In addition to educational institutions, some 
companies, especially in skilled manual labor, have 
started offering their own in-company educational 
programs. However, even with these in-company 
programs, the scale of all existing reskilling educa- 
tions combined is not sufficient to solve the shortages.

The creation of sufficient reskilling positions could 
be further accelerated by providing clarity on 
the total number and geographical locations of 
required positions for these shortage areas, and by 
orchestrating to align offerings accordingly. Larger 
companies could likely play a bigger role because 
they more often have existing in-company reskilling 
infrastructure. They could, for example, open 
their training programs to small and medium-size 
enterprises within the region and share the outflow 
of reskilled workers. 

In the short term, at least for these shortage 
areas that are essential to societal ambitions, the 
government and employers can find solutions 
to bridge the financial gap during reskilling and 
to address the insecurity blocking people from 
transitioning to a new profession.

Retention 
Especially in healthcare, but also in skilled 
manual labor, outflow to other areas of work 

is high.100 Retaining the existing labor force 
in these shortage areas of work is critical, or 
hard-fought gains in attracting new workers 
will go to waste. The causes of attrition differ 
among areas of work and require specific 
solutions to ensure new entrants stay long term. 
For health and social care, solutions to relieve 
high pressure at work and ensure appropriate 
onboarding programs are likely to be particularly 
effective, as these are often mentioned as 
reasons for leaving the industry. For example, 
FastSwitch’s nursing program ensures that 
students are onboarded properly in their new 
jobs and receive sufficient attention in the early 
months of their tenure.101 In another example, the 
Practice Transition Accreditation Program, an 
evidence-based accredited registered nurse 
residency and fellowship program created by the 
American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC), 
demonstrated an 85 percent retention rate over  
12 months, compared with the industry average 
of 71 percent.102 Retention of workers in shortage 
areas can also be achieved by ensuring that workers 
switch to other organizations in the same area of 
work instead of to completely different areas.

Upward development 
In addition to lateral movements, the train of 
job transitions requires upward development. 
Companies will have to fill some of the vacancies 
by upskilling existing employees for such roles. 
They could accelerate the transition by upskilling 
people who already have most of the required skills. 
Then, they could fill the old position of the upskilled 
employee, which is likely in an area of work that is 
easier to fill, with new inflow. Upward development 
will be relevant for all three shortage areas, and 
several examples of in-company education already 
exist. For example, Alliander, an energy grid 
operator aiming to reduce the labor shortage in the 

Retaining the existing labor force in 
these shortage areas of work is critical, 
or hard-fought gains in attracting new  
workers will go to waste.

42

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that worksenergy transition, relieves shortages by training 
employees in specific required skills instead of 
training them to do everything the job entails at 
once. Alliander then employs them to perform 
those specific skills and subsequently build on their 
skill set via on-the-job training. Enexis, another 
electricity grid operator, has a similar program. 
Hospitals can take a similar approach; for example, 
the Antonius Hospital sometimes fills a need for 
a specialized intensive care nurse by upskilling a 
registered nurse already working in the hospital.103

development by providing upskilling education and 
reskilling by training lateral entrants.

In addition to the above four main solution 
elements, a few sector-specific solutions can also 
be considered as part of the orchestrated action 
plan. For example, labor migration may be effective 
at partially solving the shortage in digital and 
technical skills, and optimizing participation can 
be particularly valuable in nursing, which sees a 
relatively high share of part-time labor.104

Government, in collaboration with key employers, 
could consider accelerating upward development 
in these three shortage areas of work by jointly 
defining the standard trajectories, upskilling 
needs, and specific train of job transitions. Then, 
employers (in some cases through collaboration 
with the education sector) could support upward 

Setting the train of job transitions into motion for 
these three areas of work with shortages can serve 
as a catalyst for the broader train of transitions 
required across the labor market. In that way, this 
orchestrated action plan could lead to broader 
cultural and practical changes in terms of mobility, 
reskilling, continuous development, and productivity.

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that worksConclusion

In this report we have presented a granular 
forecast on the 2030 Dutch labor market and 
described a pathway that could guide the 
Netherlands out of its tight labor market while 
allowing the country to maintain its societal 
ambitions by increasing productivity, further 
optimizing participation, increasing labor market 
mobility, and increasing people’s fitness to work. 

Solutions are at hand. Accelerating the adoption 
of technological innovations could quadruple 
productivity growth, resolving most of the 
tightness. This acceleration is ambitious, yet 
achievable, but it does require investments in 
technology, people, and organizations. Further 
optimizing labor participation can provide an 
additional element to resolve the tightness.

Structural changes to the labor market are 
required to help avoid a situation in which there 
is enough labor supply but a lack of the right skill 
sets. In addition, a shift in culture and mindsets 
about the labor market is necessary to support 
people in becoming increasingly mobile, going 
from 1.9 professions in their life to 2.4, on average. 
These structural and cultural changes are critical 
for ensuring sufficient mobility and getting the 
train of job transitions moving. These goals

combine lateral reskilling, upward development, 
and continuous development and are enabled 
by a labor force that is fit to work. As a starting 
point, efforts could focus on three critical areas of 
work with the highest shortages: skilled manual 
labor, especially for housing and the energy 
transition; advanced digital and tech jobs; and 
nursing and elderly care, where a combination 
of improvements in pre-occupational skilling, 
reskilling, upward development, and retention  
can help fulfill needs.

There is an urgency to act now with speed and scale. 
The scale of the challenge requires a comprehensive, 
orchestrated action plan for the next five years and 
beyond in which government, employers, employee 
organizations, educational institutions, and NGOs 
all work togeteher to build a 2030 labor market that 
works for the future of the Netherlands.

The path that is outlined here for the 
Netherlands is no small undertaking; neither is 
it comprehensive. But it indicates the scale of 
the effort and suggests some critical steps for 
shifting the country’s approach to skills, learning, 
and work to ensure it remains a great place to live 
and work—today and in the future.

Technical appendix

In this technical appendix we explain the methodology, calculations, and 
inputs we used to calculate the projections in chapter 1 of the report.

Labor market tightness
Labor market tightness is calculated based on developments in the number of vacancies and the 
level of unemployment (Exhibit A1).

Labor market tightness  =

Vacancies

Unemployment

=

Labor demand-Supplied labor

Unemployment

Unemployment. Unemployment levels are taken from CBS for the 2022 base (approximately 
350,000) and are at a historic low (relative to the past ten years or so). The assumption is that 
the unemployment rate will not drop below this level, and that unemployment will grow at the 
same rate as the working population (0.3 percent per year, in line with the State Committee on 
Demographic Developments 2050).

Vacancies. The number of vacancies is calculated as the difference between labor demand and 
supplied labor (the actual number of jobs). The number of vacancies in 2030 is projected by 
modeling the changes to this demand and supplied labor between the 2022 figure from CBS 
(approximately 440,000) and 2030. The total number of vacancies has a lower bound of 100,000 
to reflect natural friction in the labor market (as seen in historic data).

Labor demand. Labor demand in 2022 is taken as the sum of supplied labor and the number 
of vacancies. For the projection of labor demand toward 2030, we used GDP growth and labor

productivity growth. For the base scenario, we used GDP growth of 1.6 percent per year and labor 
productivity growth of 0.4 percent per year from 2010 to 2022. For the increased-productivity 
scenario, we used productivity growth of 1.8 percent per year, in line with the slower Europe 
scenario outlined in the MGI report A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills 
in Europe and beyond. On top of the labor demand coming from GDP growth, we have included

Supplied labor. Supplied labor is based on CBS data on the 2022 employed working population 
(15- to 75-year-olds, 9.5 million) and is expected to grow in line with the working population growth 
of 0.3 percent per year, consistent with expectations from the State Committee on Demographic 
Developments 2050 for the population of 15- to 65-year-olds. Additionally, increased participation 
potential of the current population (125,000 to 220,000 head count equivalent) is added to the 
supplied labor. This potential is based on expert input and consists of increased participation past 
retirement age (more years), giving more hours to part-time workers (more hours), and untapped 
potential of people currently without a job (more people) specified in Exhibit 13 in chapter 2.

Impact of socioeconomic discussions
We focused on 11 topics that have received the most attention in recent socioeconomic 
discussions. For each topic, we calculated the swing in employment for low, base, and high 
scenarios. These scenarios were developed based on quantitative and qualitative sector-specific 
inputs from media and public debates, such as levels of emissions, growth of a sector, talent, or 
accepted levels of service. The base scenario is based on current policy, with the low and high 
scenarios showing potential deviations from this base development.

Labor market demand 
This report draws on the methodology and findings from three recent McKinsey Global Institute 
reports: Generative AI and the future of work in America, The economic potential of generative 
AI, and A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyond.105 The 
technical appendixes of those reports include full descriptions of the methodology used. Below is 
a brief summary of the methodology and how it was applied to produce the findings of this report.

Employment. Our analysis draws on aggregated employment and growth projections from 
Eurostat and Statistics Netherlands (CBS). Our analysis does not seek to predict overall 
employment levels; rather, it models various factors driving labor demand to understand how 
occupational composition may change.

Automation potential and adoption scenarios. To analyze the impact of automation on work 
activities, the MGI model breaks down some 850 occupations into about 2,100 constituent 
activities using data from O*NET OnLine. Each activity was further mapped to a set of  

48

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that works18 capabilities required to perform that activity. For all 18 capabilities, we assessed current 
availability of technology and scenarios for future availability across required proficiency levels. 
This helped us assess the automation potential for an activity both today and in the future. This 
potential at an activity level was further aggregated by time spent on those activities in an 
occupation to calculate occupation-level automation potential. These occupational estimates 
were then aggregated at sector and country level by a weighted average of employment in 
respective occupations to estimate overall impact.

Scenarios for automation adoption. Several factors can hinder or enable the timing and pace of 
adoption. Solutions requiring different technologies have varying levels of ease of integration. It 
takes time to integrate capabilities into current technical platforms and combine them into an 
organic entity. Further, these solutions have to be economically feasible relative to the labor cost or 
wages to allow organizations to implement them at scale. Barriers also exist on the organizational 
side. Workers’ skills and organizational structures might act as bottlenecks to implementation. 
Policies and regulations can also affect the pace of technology innovation and adoption. Finally, 
depending on their preferences, consumers might have varying levels of acceptance for automated 
solutions, which could affect the pace of adoption. To incorporate all these factors, we used the 
mathematics of the Bass diffusion model, a well-known and widely used function in forecasting, 
especially for new-product-sales and technology forecasting.

f(t)/(1-F(t)) = p + qF(t)

F(t) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of a given technology or product) and f(t) is the 
corresponding rate of change. 

We then simulated two scenarios for historic technology adoption curves. The fitted values of 
parameters p and q are consistent with historical adoption curves for multiple technologies. It 
takes about five years to reach 50 percent adoption in the earliest scenario and approximately  
16 years in the latest scenario.

Impact of automation on productivity. In our model we used GDP per full-time-equivalent 
employee (FTE) as the measure of productivity. To measure automation’s effect on productivity, 
we first calculated the number of FTEs affected by automation by multiplying the projected 
number of FTEs in 2030 by the estimated automation adoption rate. To maintain consistency with 
other data sources, we made several additional assumptions. We considered only job activities 
that are currently available and well defined as of the date of this report. Also, to be conservative, 
we assumed automation has a labor substitution effect but no other performance gains. Finally, 
we created a scenario in which FTEs displaced by automation rejoin the workforce at 2022 

This report draws on the methodology 
and findings from three recent 
McKinsey Global Institute reports.

Netherlands advanced: Building a future labor market that worksproductivity levels. Under the assumptions outlined above, we first calculated the additional  
GDP impact of FTEs rejoining the labor force after the defined automation adoption scenario  
as follows:

Additional GDP from displaced  
FTEs rejoining the economy  
=  
FTE impact of automation adoption
* 
productivity of 2022

The additional GDP is then added to 2022 GDP to derive the productivity impact and its growth 
over 2022–30.

Impact of the net-zero transition. The European Union has made international commitments 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. We examined the impact of this 
commitment on jobs using a scenario-based analysis drawing on the approach used by NGFS 
(scenario REMIND-MAgPIE 2.1-4.1, published in June 2022). We built on previous McKinsey 
research assessing the impact at a global level to analyze the specific implications for the 
Netherlands, adding sectoral and occupational dimensions to the analysis. This net-zero analysis 
assumes that current supply chain composition remains the same until 2030. We considered the 
impact of the European Union meeting its own emissions targets as well as its role in meeting 
global demand for products. Jobs gained and lost are allocated as per the occupational mix of 
2022. We considered job losses and gains directly and indirectly associated with the transition for 
operations and maintenance and capital expenditure. We did not include other macroeconomic 
forces such as population and income growth.

Long-term labor market trends. In estimating labor demand, we factored in six macroeconomic 
catalysts—rising incomes, healthcare and aging, technological innovation, infrastructure 
investment, education, and the marketization of unpaid work—across the economy. We captured 
direct and indirect jobs that could be created from each catalyst by leveraging job multipliers from 
input-output tables.

Trends accelerated by COVID-19. We incorporated broad trends accelerated by the pandemic that 
may influence labor demand and jobs in the economy through 2030, including increased remote 
work and virtual meetings and the shift to e-commerce and other virtual transactions.
