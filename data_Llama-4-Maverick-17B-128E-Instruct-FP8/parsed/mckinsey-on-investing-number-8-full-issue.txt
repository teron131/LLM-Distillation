Introduction

Welcome to the eighth volume of McKinsey on Investing, our flagship compendium of insights relevant to 
investors. These perspectives have been contributed by McKinsey colleagues across the globe who are experts 
in a diverse array of disciplines, including asset management, institutional investing, and private markets.

It’s a turbulent—and busy—time in private markets. Portfolios are fuller than ever and there is significant dry 
powder across the industry. Yet fundraising and deal making for larger transactions are well off 2021’s highs. 
Further, the slowdown in exits, coupled with declining public market valuations and the resulting denominator 
effect, has shifted investor allocations. As a result, the current fundraising environment is far more challenging 
than in the past several years. Finally, the availability of debt has fallen even as its cost has grown rapidly, making 
transactions difficult. 

In times like these, value creation in a portfolio becomes a crucial differentiator for firms and funds, focusing 
minds on pricing, procurement, and supply chain resilience and reconfiguration. Though financing is challenging 
and uncertainty high, we continue to see our clients pursue opportunities even as they manage for uncertainty 
in their portfolio companies. This strategy has yielded results in the past: firms that were more aggressive with 
integrations, capital reallocation, and investing for growth during previous corrections were able to accelerate out 
of the downturn. We will continue to publish insights as private markets evolve; if your fund would like a preview of 
our perspectives, please write or call and we will be pleased to arrange a discussion.

This issue of McKinsey on Investing steps back from the immediate challenge of the market— and the broader 
macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty— to present a longer-term perspective on how investment firms 
are evolving and the thematic ways investors have and will put money to work. We are also pleased to include new 
research that captures the state of diversity in private equity while discussing the role of institutional investors as 
a catalyst for change.

We hope you enjoy this collection and discover in it ideas worthy of your consideration. You can find these and 
other perspectives relevant to investing at McKinsey.com/Investing and in our McKinsey Insights app, available 
for Android and  iOS.

‘Making the world a better 
place never feels like work’: 
An interview with chief DEI 
officer Indhira Arrington

Ares Management’s first global chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer talks  
about how she is building the company’s DEI strategy from the ground up.

7

The business case for diversity, equity, and 
inclusion (DEI) is stronger than ever, but many 
companies’ DEI programs are stalled or have slipped 
backward. That’s because intentions aren’t the 
same as execution and process infrastructure—
something that Indhira Arrington learned in her first 
year at the global alternative asset management 
firm Ares Management (Ares), for which she is the 
managing director and first global chief DEI officer 
(CDO). Arrington believes that Ares needs to embed 
DEI into many aspects of what it and its portfolio 
businesses do, including human capital, business, 
and investment processes. 

In an interview with McKinsey’s Diana Ellsworth 
and Drew Goldstein, Arrington discusses why it’s 
important to listen and gather data before creating 
a DEI strategy and why she’s focused on building a 
culture of representation, especially when it comes 
to recruitment, retention, and talent development. 
As an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, 
Arrington feels an enormous responsibility to open 
doors for others, as sponsors and mentors did for 
her. “Making the world a better place never feels like 
work,” she says. The following is an edited version of 
their conversation. 

McKinsey: Why is DEI important to Ares? 

change beyond our own walls. And we know that if 
we can help our portfolio companies become more 
inclusive, more equitable, that can help drive long-
term performance. Before I was hired, DEI at Ares 
was largely employee driven. But our leadership 
recognized that we needed a formal structure. And 
so my role reports to both talent, meaning HR, and 
the CEO.

We’re operationalizing DEI through our people and 
culture, as well as our business and investment 
process. We’re ensuring that we have the 
infrastructure, strategy, plans, goals, and KPIs to 
hold ourselves and select portfolio companies 
accountable. We drive DEI in our investment 
process because we believe it can lead to better 
ROI, and so we have a DEI lens when we make 
investments. We’ve intentionally woven DEI into our 
procurement processes, working to identify current 
diverse spend and then find areas where we can 
transfer spend to diverse suppliers. We’re seeking 
to lead by example so that we can be in a position to 
offer advice to our portfolio companies and create 
a playbook for how they, too, can approach supplier 
diversity. We’re also looking at the impact we have 
on our communities through our philanthropy, 
maximizing our giving, our employee volunteerism, 
and our matching of employee donations. 

Indhira Arrington: The whole point of our DEI 
strategy is to be a force for good for Ares, for 
the companies in which we invest and in the 
communities in which we operate. We recognize 
the power and influence that we have to create 

What I love about our approach is, at the core, we’re 
data driven. We’re setting KPIs, and we’re holding 
ourselves accountable for the change we want to 
see—because we believe that what gets measured 
gets done. 

‘We’re holding ourselves accountable

took a very pragmatic approach and made the first 
90 days about data gathering. 

Indhira Arrington: I came in focused on listening. 
In this job, there’s work to be done everywhere you 
look. It’s difficult not to rush in and start trying to 
get things done right away. And I’m super type A, so 
it drives me crazy not to jump into execution. But I 

We began with a quantitative and qualitative 
assessment of the starting point for us and a cohort 
of our portfolio companies. When I think about 
data from a human capital perspective, I keep 
things simple. For me, it’s a + b – c: recruiting plus

promotions minus departures. Cut that by a diversity 
dimension and by title, and you can clearly see at 
any point what your representation looks like. It’s 
a nice way to start mapping out which people you 
need to spend time with and which processes to 
evaluate to understand how we got to where we are. 

I met with over 120 team members one by one. I 
was after three things: to see how they felt about 
working at Ares, where they thought we were on 
our DEI journey, and what they thought success 
should look like from a DEI perspective. I also 
looked at some external surveys to glean insight 
into how employees were experiencing the 
organization through the dimension of diversity. 
Finally, I met with functional leaders. 

The most challenging part of being a CDO is that 
you don’t own any place where the work gets done. 
You don’t own any of the functions. I’m meant to 
drive change through influence, which is awesome 
but can also be challenging. So I sat with functional 
leaders from recruiting and HR to understand our 
talent management process and with business 
leaders to understand how they viewed DEI from 
a business perspective and the procurement 
function. I worked to gather as much information  
as possible.

McKinsey: How did you create your strategic  
DEI plan? 

Indhira Arrington: Once we understood where we 
were from a DEI perspective, we set out to form 
a strategic plan. Together with a core set of our 
portfolio companies, we went through a pipeline 
assessment to help identify our diversity gaps, an 
infrastructure assessment to see whether we had 
the infrastructure in place to operationalize DEI, 
and an inclusion assessment that included a global 
inclusion survey across all participating firms. That 
last assessment gave us quantifiable inclusion 
ratings, as well as our gaps by diversity dimension, 
line of business, title, and location. We could look 
within our firms and be very surgical about how we 
were going to narrow those gaps. 

We then worked with these portfolio companies 
to create strategic plans for each individual firm, in 
addition to further refining Ares’s own strategic 
plan. Each developed a three-year DEI plan of 
its own, with a vision, objectives, initiatives, and 
metrics to monitor. In total, more than 200 DEI 
initiatives were planned. Some targeted, for 
instance, increased representation of women and 
Black, Indigenous, and people of color colleagues 
at the manager level and above. Some targeted 
increased diversity among suppliers. We upskilled 
our own team members who sat on those portfolio 
company boards so they could help drive DEI from 
the boardroom. We prepared each company to add 
DEI to the board agenda on a quarterly basis and 
are supporting them to execute on it. We’ve set up 
a community with members from each firm, which 
meets monthly to share best practices. 

McKinsey: Where have you seen the DEI strategy 
make the most difference? 

Indhira Arrington: One process we were able to 
change within Ares—and make it the new way we 
do business—was in our recruiting. We set out to 
increase representation where we have gaps. We 
found that we weren’t seeing enough diversity at 
the job seeker and qualified-candidate levels. We 
also saw that not enough candidates were getting 
through our funnel and making it to first-round 
interviews. We decided to change our process. 

We began implementing diverse talent slates at first-
round interviews. We launched a pilot in the US where 
we require a minimum of four candidates in first-
round interviews, and at least half  must be diverse. 
We worked with our recruitment team to source 
diverse talent for the slate and with our search firms 
so they also can support the diverse-slate mandate. 

We are also extremely proud of launching the 
AltFinance Investing in Black Futures initiative. 
The asset management industry is one of the least 
diverse in the US, with a substantial lack of Black 
talent. We decided to help solve this industry 
problem. Through the Ares Charitable Foundation, 

10

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022along with two industry peers, Apollo Global 
Management and Oaktree Capital Management, 
we jointly committed $90 million over a period of 
ten years through the Ares charitable foundation to 
start a nonprofit focused on engaging, attracting, 
and creating a pathway for HBCU [historically 
Black colleges and universities] students to join 
the asset management industry.1 It also provides 
need-based scholarships. 

AltFinance Investing is partnering with the 
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania 

to create a curriculum for students to understand 
the different verticals and careers within the  
asset management industry, get through industry 
case study interviews, and hopefully join us  
for a successful summer internship.2 And then it’s 
about converting the interns to full-time employees 
and working with the recruiting teams at our firms 
to hire the students and set them up for success. 
I’m excited to share that we and other firms 
recently welcomed our first cohort of interns.

Forging your own path:  
Sandra Horbach on building  
a career in private equity

The cohead of US buyout and growth at Carlyle shares thoughts on the path 
forward on diversity and inclusion, and advice on building a successful career 
in the industry.

12

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022This conversation between Sandra Horbach, 
managing director and cohead of US buyout and 
growth at Carlyle; Rodney Zemmel, senior partner 
and global leader, McKinsey Digital; and Alexandra 
Nee, partner and global head of diversity, equity, and 
inclusion for the Private Equity & Principal Investors 
Practice was recorded on October 26, 2021. It was 
part of McKinsey’s Women in Private Equity Global 
Forum, held virtually, with an audience of 143 women 
investors from 46 firms across North America and 
Europe. The following is an abridged transcript.

Rodney Zemmel: While Sandra Horbach certainly 
needs no introduction in a group like this, I’m thrilled to 
have the cohead of US buyout and growth at Carlyle 
with us. Ms. Horbach oversees Carlyle’s three largest 
private equity funds, with approximately $60 billion in 
capital under management. Prior to joining Carlyle, Ms. 
Horbach was a general partner with Forstmann Little 
& Company and also worked in the M&A department 
of Morgan Stanley. She earned her MBA from Stanford 
University and BA from Wellesley College. I’m thrilled 
to introduce Sandra to you all and look forward to our 
conversation today. Welcome, Sandra!

Alexandra Nee: Sandra, one of our first questions is 
this: As we think about how the private equity industry 
has changed recently, we would love to get your 
thoughts—for some of the women investors we have 
joining us—on how private equity has changed as a 
career over the last decade. And how will recruiting 
into these private equity roles be affected by this 
going forward?

Sandra Horbach: I would say one thing that has been 
a welcome change is a lot more focus on diversity. 
Unfortunately, a lot of investment firms are still not 
anywhere near where they need to be, especially at 
the senior levels, in terms of having diverse teams. We 
really think diverse teams result in better investment 
decisions. I’ve seen it over and over again: when we 
bring in diverse perspectives, we come out with a 
better outcome. That’s true of investment decisions. 
It’s also true of business decisions at the board level 
and within portfolio companies. So, we still have a 
long way to go as an industry, but I’m thrilled to see 
that there is definitely a lot more focus on diversity.

In terms of recruiting, I would say that we see 
more focus on specialization. When I started in the 
business, everybody was a generalist because, 
first of all, there weren’t that many of us and the 
businesses were much smaller. But today, amid so 
much competition, you really have to have an area in 
which you specialize.

The second thing I would say is I think that firms 
are looking for people coming out of different 
backgrounds, so not just necessarily the traditional 
consulting or investment banking backgrounds. I 
think people are opening the aperture to people 
with industry experience or other types of 
functional experience.

The last thing I would say is there are a lot of other 
important players who create significant value, both 
in the diligence process and post-acquisition, during 
the value-creation process. Those are some of the 
functional experts that I mentioned on the digital 
side, on the talent side, IT, et cetera. They drive a lot 
of value. So that’s going to be, I think increasingly, an 
area where people are leaning in and where we’re 
even hiring data scientists.

Alexandra Nee: You made partner initially at 
Forstmann Little and then obviously have been 
tremendously successful at Carlyle since. Is there 
any advice that you have for other women looking to 
advance to [the] top levels of their firms?

Sandra Horbach: It was a very different era when 
I made partner. At Forstmann Little, I was the first 
woman, but there were only five other people 
there when I joined, so I was the sixth investment 
professional. Fortunately, I was in a growing industry; 
and it’s always great to be in a business or a sector 
with tailwinds because as you grow, you can take on 
additional responsibility and advance very quickly. 
Today, private equity is a more mature business. The 
firms are more established, and they have more people, 
and so it does take longer to go through that path.

I also think the skills that we’re bringing as investors 
are so much more sophisticated than when I started 
out investing back in the late ’80s. The value creation

that sponsors are bringing to portfolio companies, 
and the complexity of the world, and the diligence 
that we do has completely changed. As a result, it 
takes time to get to the level where you’re able to 
master all of that to run and lead deals, which is really 
our definition of what an MD [managing director] 
should be able to do.

So, in terms of advice, I would say the most important 
thing is to be brave, be your own advocate, and don’t 
cower away from the challenging assignments. One 
of the most significant assignments I ever had was 
going in to look at a turnaround that we’d invested a 
lot of capital in. It was almost a bet-the-firm type of 
investment that had gone south. I thought, “I can’t 
believe they’re asking me to do this, because what do 
I know?” But I jumped in, and I lived at this company 
for three or four months, trying to understand the 
problems so I could make my best recommendations 
for the changes we had to make. We were successful 
in the end, and it turned out to be one of our most 
successful investments. It was one of the best things 
that could have happened to me because I was 
thrown in, and it was tough.

But if you are successful in those types of situations, 
you get a lot of credit, and you’ll advance your career. 
You learn so much more, usually, in those situations 
where you’re struggling. So, don’t be afraid of a tough 
assignment; in fact, volunteer!

I’d appreciate if you can talk about why this is 
important and what challenges, if any, your firm has 
had in implementing this. And also, are there things 
that you’ve learned which other firms looking to 
follow suit can do to be successful here?

Sandra Horbach: Yes. I have learned that it must start 
at the top, and you have to be serious about it if you 
want to see change because it’s so much easier just 
to hire somebody who looks just like you and went to 
the same school and same fraternity or worked in the 
same investment banking group and what-have-you. 
So, you really have to be committed to it. We’ve been 
committed to it for over a decade.

I would encourage other firms that are truly serious 
about diversity to set the policy and enforce it. We’ve 
seen that’s the only way it works, and it’s not going to 
happen at the speed that we all are looking for it to 
happen if we don’t.

For the past eight years, all our incoming classes 
on my team have been at least 50 percent diverse. 
That’s our pipeline of future leaders. Also, for 
all lateral hiring, we require a diverse slate, and 
that actually goes through our Diversity, Equity 
& Inclusion Council, which I’m a member of. The 
council is led by our CEO, and all the senior fund 
leaders in the firm are members, so that obviously 
speaks to how we view its importance.

The last thing I’d say is, I always tell the folks at Carlyle, 
“Use your voice and own the room.” I mean, you have 
to feel as though you deserve to have a seat at the 
table. And I’m telling you right now, you all do. But 
you have to own it and be responsible for that and 
manage your own careers.

Rodney Zemmel: Another question from the 
audience just starts with a thank you for being such 
a role model in the investing industry for so many 
women. Then it goes on to ask, “How is Carlyle 
approaching work-life balance in the new COVID-
19 normal, or the hopefully soon post-COVID-19 
normal—and particularly for working moms?”

You can’t expect somebody else to be looking out 
for you. It’s nice if they do; it’s nice to get sponsors—
that’s great; mentors are great. But at the end of the 
day, it’s on all of us to decide what we want to do and 
how forward-leaning we want to be. And then we 
just have to lean in. As I always say, “When someone 
opens the door, walk right through it, and go for it.”

Alexandra Nee: Sandra, at Carlyle, you’ve initiated a 
charge to make sure at least 50 percent of the firm’s 
incoming class are women or minority [candidates]. 

Sandra Horbach: Flexibility is the most important 
thing you can give. Carlyle is back in the office now, 
but we have gone back in a hybrid model, so we 
are giving a lot of discretion to managers. For my 
teams, we are back three days a week, but each team 
can choose which three days those are, and those 
include travel days. If you’re out traveling for three 
days at board meetings, when you return, you can 
work remotely from home. What we, and I think all 
companies, learned in the pandemic is we can trust 

14

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022our employees: they are awesome and driven. I guess 
if you’re in this industry, it’s safe to say you probably 
all are. Based on what we’ve seen, people worked as 
hard, if not harder, during the pandemic.

We have dedicated employees, and they want to 
get their jobs done, but they do want flexibility and 
they deserve it. We all work really hard, so the more 
flexibility we can give to our teams, the better.

In terms of work-life balance, I do worry that the 
increased velocity in deal timelines that we’re seeing 
really takes a toll on the team. What used to be an 
already intense four-to-six-week process is now 
condensed into a three-week process. That’s going 
to hurt us over the long run. It’s going to hurt morale. 
But I think it’ll especially hurt women. Because, let’s 
face it, we do carry a little bit more responsibility, in 
most cases both at the office and at home.

You can have the best policies in the world, but you 
also need a culture that supports diverse employees. 
In order to retain talented women, I think the most 
important thing you can give, especially now that 
firms understand you can be very effective working 
remotely, is flexibility (especially when someone’s 
earlier in their career and they are trying to balance 
family, work, and other responsibilities). So, for us, if 
someone wants to take an extended period of time 
off beyond our standard parental leave policy, we 
hold the position open for them when they come back. 
To me, it’s less about the policies you put in place than 
the culture and the attitude that embraces people’s 
circumstances.

In the early days, people would say, “Do you think 
she’s going to come back after maternity leave?” I 
would respond, “Would you ever ask that of a man? 
No. Of course, she’s going to come back.” She didn’t 
go to Harvard Business School or the Stanford 
Graduate School of Business and work four years 
before that and work here for the last eight years, just 
to walk away now.

So, it’s a long journey, but it’s about shifting the mindset 
and creating a truly inclusive culture. This is the respon- 
sibility of the leaders of an organization. If you say one 
thing and you are acting differently, people see that.

It’s also on all of us to speak up. It’s about using your 
voice so that if you have an issue, you shouldn’t just 
hold onto it yourself and think you’re going to have to 
figure it out alone. Because I know people who ended 
up quitting because they couldn’t handle certain 
things, but they never raised [those issues]. So, make 
sure you ask for help if you need it and understand 
that if you’re doing a great job, firms want to keep you, 
so they’ll work with you to adjust things accordingly. 
It will help not only you, but [also] the whole firm’s 
culture of inclusivity.

Alexandra Nee: What do you think private equity 
investment professionals don’t spend enough time 
on when looking at deals? What are the common 
missteps or the errors that cost them?

Sandra Horbach: I think it’s the people side, 
because I think a lot of private equity folks are very 
transactional. Now, with this compressed time frame, 
it’s hard to get quality time with management teams 
that are going to be your partners over the next four 
to five years. When I started in this business, you 
basically lived at the company for a month while 
you were doing your diligence. You really got to 
understand the culture, people, and strengths of an 
organization before you made the investment, as well 
as, naturally, the opportunities for improvement. It’s 
very hard to do that in today’s marketplace.

The most successful PE leaders are those who 
continually develop their network and relationships 
so that they have a relationship with someone before 
we get to the point where we’re talking about an 
investment. I always say, “If you meet a management 
team for the first time at a management meeting, you 
have already lost the deal.” Because someone else 
was there, and they’ve got a leg up, an advantage in 
that transaction.

That is actually good advice for women because 
I think men do it better than women because we 
have so many other things we’re juggling. But you 
have to take time to develop and advance your 
network, keep it current, and cultivate it. It’s so easy 
to just get absorbed doing work all the time, and 
the relationship cultivation can always be put off till 
tomorrow. But over the long run, over your career, 

Forging your own path: Sandra Horbach on building a career in private equity

those relationships are really going to serve you well if 
you’ve been a good partner. And it’s been a two-way 
street in terms of what you’ve given to those other 
professionals.

Rodney Zemmel: What [are] one or two pieces 
of career advice, particularly for women who are 
building careers in PE, that you’d want to pass on?

Sandra Horbach: I would say, “Keep at it.” If you feel 
like your career is going to be limited in your current 
firm or you don’t like the culture, don’t stay there, 
but don’t leave the industry. Go and find another 
firm. Believe me, there are so many firms out there 
now. Just redirect and pivot. It doesn’t have to be a 
name brand firm where you can go and get a positive, 
great experience—because this industry is so much 
fun. I mean, we get to see so many different types 
of businesses and situations, with so many amazing 
management teams and people, all while working 
with really smart people within our own firms. You are 
never bored in private equity. I’ve never been bored in 
30 years.

Tenacity, resiliency, grit—they pay off over a career.

The other piece of advice is just that there is no 
substitute for hard work. Many people ask me, “How 
do you get to this or that level?” I always have the same 
response: “Do the best job you can in the current job 
you’re in.” That’s how you get to the next level—really 
distinguish yourself and make sure you become 
indispensable in some area. And try to have fun too!

Don’t take yourself too seriously. There are tons of 
bumps along the road. My career looks like it was 
just straight lines. But it wasn’t, and no one’s is. You 
have to go with it to be able to deal with setbacks 
and failures and not let them get you down. I wish 
everybody well, and again, I’m happy to have been 
a role model for many years. I just want to see a lot 
more women in senior roles be able to play that role 
for their organization as well.

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022How an acquisition 
invigorated an asset 
management leader

Jenny Johnson, president and CEO of Franklin Templeton, 
explains how the firm’s acquisition of Legg Mason positions it 
for the next phase of growth.

17

Jenny Johnson grew up in the investment 
management business, rising through the ranks  
of Franklin Templeton (a firm founded by her 
grandfather) for 32 years before taking over from  
her brother as president and CEO in early 2020. 
Within days, she announced the biggest transaction 
in the company’s history: the acquisition of 
Baltimore-based competitor Legg Mason. 

The $4.5 billion transaction roughly doubled Franklin 
Templeton’s assets under management (AUM) to  
$1.5 trillion and made it the sixth-largest independent 
investment manager in the world. The merger brings 
to Franklin Templeton additional expertise in core 
fixed income, equities, and alternatives, and expands 
its multi-asset investment solutions. McKinsey’s 
Robert Byrne spoke with Johnson recently about the 
challenges of blending cultures in a merger of equals, 
the disruptions coming to the asset management 
industry, and the need to democratize access to 
high-return investment opportunities. An edited 
version of their conversation follows.

Robert Byrne: This acquisition seems like a baptism 
by fire for you as a new CEO. A few weeks after 
you took over and announced the acquisition, the 
pandemic hit. What was it like to go through so  
many experiences at the same time?

Jenny Johnson: We were all very excited about the 
Legg Mason announcement and what it meant for 
our respective companies, and of course thousands 
of employees, clients, and shareholders. For me 
personally, it served as big news to start off my 
tenure as CEO, but it was definitely a team effort.  
I had the benefit of still having the former CEO of 
Franklin Templeton as executive chairman and our 
CFO had experience with many transactions. 

We had been working on the Legg Mason 
transaction for about eight months and I was very 
involved. It was part of a multiyear strategic plan 
where we identified key growth accelerators for 
our business. And when the pandemic hit, we never 
looked back. For us it was a growth story, from filling 
product gaps to providing client diversification to 

acquiring new capabilities. In some situations, a  
CEO may face pressure from investors who look  
for short-term gains versus taking a long-term 
perspective, but we had the benefit of having long-
term shareholders. I was more confident than ever 
about our future. 

Robert Byrne: The merger closed earlier than many 
expected. How did you manage the integration? 

Jenny Johnson: The integration was about laying  
out and communicating very clear goals, and 
we’re proud of the progress we have made toward 
achieving them. One of the merger’s goals was to 
infuse talent into the firm, and getting people to be 
open to that was really important.

When you are picking talent for new roles, you want 
to be able to do that in person and I was fortunate 
to have arranged a two-week trip to visit all of Legg 
Mason’s investment boutiques that ended right 
before the lockdowns in March 2020. That made a 
huge difference because even that limited interaction 
helped build trust and move things along in the 
integration. In an acquisition, everybody is nervous 
about their future roles. As you get further up in 
the organization, there is only one seat for certain 
functions and in an acquisition of two equally sized 
firms, there are two candidates for many roles. In 
some cases, we didn’t go with a Franklin Templeton 
candidate, and those were tough conversations. 

Robert Byrne: Your father, former longtime CEO 
of Franklin Templeton, had said that Franklin does 
what’s right for the client and the business takes 
care of itself. How did that philosophy inform your 
approach to client retention? 

Jenny Johnson: The clients’ primary concern was 
that the merger would be a distraction for us, so 
it was important for us to keep them informed 
about the progress. Early on, we developed a more 
adaptable regional distribution model which pushed 
decision making and resources closer to our clients 
to be more responsive to their needs. We also 

18

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022invested significant time training our sales teams  
on the expanded range of capabilities. Once our 
clients were comfortable with the decisions we were 
making, they started to ask, “What else is available? 
Tell me how this is good for me.” We are seeing the 
benefits of cross-selling. 

Naturally, we expected there would be some 
growing pains. We had to change the relationship 
managers for some clients, which is always hard 
for people. Half the financial advisers have a new 
wholesaler supporting them and it will take time  
for those relationships to be established.

Robert Byrne: How will you define and measure the 
merger’s success as you continue the integration? 

strengths in separately managed accounts  
[SMAs] and customized solutions with the power  
of custom indexing. 

These plus the Legg Mason acquisition have greatly 
expanded our ability to create new solutions—now 
it’s like being a chef walking into the best-stocked 
kitchen. Another area that’s exciting, but will take 
time to unlock, is the diverse expertise that specialist 
investment managers can learn from each other.

Robert Byrne: You opted to not fully integrate Legg 
Mason’s independent boutiques, aiming rather 
to create what you have described as a “cross-
fertilization.” What impact does this decision have on 
the culture of the merged entity?

Jenny Johnson: It’s many of the traditional 
measurements in the industry: Are we growing the 
business? Do we see positive net flows? Are our 
solutions teams sought after as advisers? And we  
are seeing positive developments, with organic 
growth in a number of key areas. With the recent 
announcement of the acquisition of Lexington 
Partners, we now have top-tier specialist investment 
managers in all the key alternative categories. When 
we close the Lexington transaction next year, we 
expect our alternative assets under management  
to approach $200 billion. We also recently 
announced plans to acquire O’Shaughnessy Asset 
Management, which will complement our existing 

Jenny Johnson: Some of the Legg Mason 
investment teams are quite independent, and are 
fully functioning businesses with their own lawyers, 
CFOs, and other functions. As a global organization 
we can be helpful but rather than imposing this 
help on them, we let them opt in. Our philosophy 
has always been that the investment management 
teams are completely independent and the chief 
investment officer determines the investment 
process. At the same time, we have provided 
incentives to leaders of the investment teams to also 
focus on the success of the broader organization. 
A transaction gives you the flexibility to implement 
that, which would have been hard otherwise. 

‘Investment bankers will tell you why a 
transaction is a great strategic fit and 
has a great price, but they will never talk 
about culture. Yet, in our experience, 
deals succeed or fail based on whether 
the cultures mesh.’

How an acquisition invigorated an asset management leader

19

Remember that we were essentially buying nine 
cultures that we did not fully understand: the 
investment side had eight teams with unique 
cultures, plus the parent company. Investment 
bankers will tell you why a transaction is a great 
strategic fit and has a great price, but they will never 
talk about culture. Yet, in our experience, deals 
succeed or fail based on whether the cultures mesh. 

Robert Byrne: Let’s turn to broader industry trends. 
The impact of blockchain and the arrival of digital 
assets have long been topics of speculation. How 
disruptive will these changes be?

Jenny Johnson: Blockchain is the biggest disruption 
I have seen in my 30 years in this industry. Take, 
for instance, tokenization: an individual can build 
ownership rules into code that allow them to  
transfer illiquid assets much more easily. You can 
fractionalize ownership and then provide additional 
services through nonfungible token [NFT] validation. 
To put this concept into a real-world example,  
the Empire State Building could be sold to a million 
different people and those investors wouldn’t  
need to do an ownership transfer; it’s all there in  
that token. 

you got a smartphone and thought it was cool but 
did not appreciate its full capabilities. Now, you 
probably use it more than your computer. 

Robert Byrne: Do you see asset managers being  
in the vanguard of bringing these innovations to  
the masses?

Jenny Johnson: Well, I don’t know how many are 
paying attention. Franklin Templeton already has 
a money market fund built on blockchain. Many 
people think this is further off, but overnight it could 
coalesce. Is that two years from now? I don’t know, 
but once it starts, it will take off.

Robert Byrne: Where do you see pockets of 
demand for alternative investments and will the 
distribution model change?

Jenny Johnson: Our clients deserve the broadest 
range of investment choice, and expanding into 
alternatives helps to provide all clients with access 
to performance and return drivers that differ  
from more traditional investments. For an asset 
manager, alternatives also provide for the potential 
of higher margins. 

This phenomenon will unlock and democratize 
assets in a way we have never seen. It will be 
fundamental to bringing alternative investments  
to the retail space, which needs to happen. The 
illiquidity premium has been so significant that it’s 
dangerous for us as a society to only allow wealthy 
people to benefit from those returns. But it’s a 
running-with-scissors scenario: NFTs are great 
tools but, boy, if used incorrectly, smaller investors 
could potentially get hurt.  

The other concept I find fascinating is decentralized 
finance [DeFi]. Today, if I want to create a new 
company, I pitch it to friends, family, and venture 
capitalists and they become my equity providers 
before I launch the product. DeFi instead gives 
equity to the customers who help you build the 
business. When you become a user of my code,  
I can pay you in tokens that become valuable over 
time. This will change the traditional equity model, 
but we are only scratching the surface. It’s like when 

My team and I recently discussed some of the more 
complex issues that we as a manufacturer face in 
order to get private-market products to the hands 
of retail investors—whether through their financial 
professional or even inside a 401(k) plan. How do you 
value a private company daily? What about liquidity? 
Seventy-five years ago, Franklin got into mutual 
funds because back then the little guy didn’t have 
access to the market. Mutual funds were hard to 
explain and took a long time to be embraced. It was 
30-plus years before Franklin raised the first billion 
dollars, so firms have to be patient and committed.

Fast forward to today and we’re seeing the 
same concept play out with alternatives. There 
is a massive amount of money available to keep 
companies private longer. Let’s face it: when you go 
public, the scrutiny soars, so many companies prefer 
to wait. If that growth trajectory is not available to 
the retail investor, that will be a huge problem. 

20

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022Passive tends to do well in a momentum market, 
but we cannot sustain the current level of central 
bank intervention and when that stops, there will be 
more differentiation in returns, which is where active 
management does better. 

I also think data will be more and more important. 
Anybody making active decisions, whether at a 
macro or individual-company level, will be looking for 
nontraditional sources of data to gain an edge. That 
data is expensive because in data analysis there are 
far more dead ends than positive signals you can act 
on. Active asset managers will have to be as good as 
Google is at understanding how to get insights from 
data. Scale allows you to share those costs across 
a broader asset base and that will be one element 
that pushes M&A. Additionally, distribution partners 
worry about risk management, compliance, and 
technology investment. Investment companies will 
want to make sure that their partners are investing 
in those critical areas because if one of them sinks, 
it splashes back on them. That is another factor that 
will drive M&A.

Robert Byrne: You are now 20 months into your role 
as CEO. Is there anything you know now that you 
wish you knew when you started?

Jenny Johnson: Being willing to move people out of 
roles can be hard but very important. In basketball, 
if you have the point guard playing the center 
position, that person will not be effective, even if he 
or she is the greatest point guard ever. You need the 
right people in the right seats and a team that trusts 
each other. 

Robert Byrne: There has been an awakening in the 
past few years about corporations’ responsibility 
to society. Do you think the focus on purpose, 
stakeholder capitalism, and environmental, social, 
and corporate governance [ESG] issues will persist, 
and what impact does that have for your industry?

Jenny Johnson: A leading publication did a CEO 
survey a year ago asking, “Is stakeholder capitalism 
new and here to stay?” And I was one of the few who 
said no. I said that because stakeholder capitalism 
has always existed. Good companies have always 
paid attention to their clients, their community, and 
their employees, who are your biggest assets.  
All those stakeholders have to be in the minds of 
successful leaders—it’s certainly how my father  
ran the business. We are just doing a better job of 
articulating it today. 

ESG and sustainable investing are also here to 
stay, and it’s to the advantage of active managers 
because ESG data is hard to get, it’s not consistent, 
and there is a lot of window dressing. I think we will 
see a shift to investment products that truly dig in to 
measure ESG performance. Clients will be asking, 
“How did I do in my returns and what impact did I 
have?” I have five kids and I see it with them: they are 
willing to be uncomfortable to save the environment. 
My daughter will not use a plastic water bottle; she  
will forgo water if that’s the only option. This 
generation will demand that their managers go 
thoroughly through the data and measure the 
impact. People will smell it if you’re not genuine.

Robert Byrne: Do you expect M&A to play a role 
in bringing some of the shifts you have been 
describing to the mainstream marketplace?

Jenny Johnson: First and foremost, I believe the 
next decade will not be dominated by passive 
investment management like the last decade was.

The state of diversity  
in global private  
markets: 2022

New research captures regional differences in the state of diversity in 
private equity and discusses the role of institutional investors as a catalyst 
for change.

This article is a collaborative effort by Pontus Averstad, David Baboolall, Alejandro Beltrán, Eitan Lefkowitz, 
Alexandra Nee, Gary Pinshaw, and David Quigley, representing views from McKinsey’s Private Equity and  
Principal Investors Practice and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Service lines.

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022Our new report, The state of diversity in global 
Private Markets: 2022, builds on prior McKinsey 
research on diversity in the workplace to explore 
diversity in the global private markets industry, 
with a focus on private equity (PE) firms and 
institutional investors (IIs). We surveyed 42 PE 
firms and IIs around the world and conducted 
interviews with several industry leaders to 
supplement the data we received back from these 
firms. Participating PE firms directly employ more 
than 60,000 people globally.

This report provides insights into three areas for 
the industry: a view of IIs’ evaluation of diversity on 
investing deal teams today; II’s preference toward 
more diverse deal teams when allocating capital to 
PE firms; and today’s baseline of diversity for PE 
investing teams in terms of gender diversity for the 
Americas, Asia–Pacific (APAC), and Europe, and 
ethnic and racial diversity for the United States  
and Canada.

Key findings include:

 — Chief investment officers (CIOs) of leading IIs 

said they would allocate twice as much capital 
to the more gender diverse PE firm if choosing 
between two otherwise comparable firms. More 
ethnically and racially diverse PE deal teams 
would receive 2.6 times as much capital.

 — While 23 percent of all investing roles are held 

by women at PE firms globally, by the managing 
director level, only 12 percent are women.

 — PE firms’ employee diversity varies widely. At 

diversity leaders, 32 percent of MDs are women 
and 32 percent of MDs are ethnic and racial 
minorities. Diversity laggards have no women and  
2 percent ethnic and racial minorities at the MD level.

 — Geographic differences are also notable. PE 

offices in the Americas have the highest share 
of women in the C-suite and possibly the 
fewest obstacles to advancement for women; 
APAC leads the regions in investing women’s 
representation in the middle of the corporate 
ladder; and Europe leads slightly at entry-level 
investing roles.

 — Even when they make it to senior investing ranks, 
women and ethnic and racial minorities may 
still not hold the same position of power as their 
counterparts. PE investment committees (ICs) 
report 9 percent women globally and 9 percent 
ethnic and racial minorities in Canada and the 
United States—three to eight percentage points 
lower than their share of investing MD roles.

Given data collection limitations, this report 
remained largely focused on gender and ethnic 
or racial diversity within PE firms. We recognize 
there are several other categories that contribute 
to the diversity of employees. Future reports hope 
to broaden the categories examined, as well as 
expand to include PE firm Portfolio Companies, 
among other segments within private markets. The 
inaugural survey findings highlight the importance 
to IIs of having diverse talent in PE and the progress 
the PE industry has made over the course of 2021 
(for more, see sidebar “Institutional investors in the 
private market ecosystem”). It also provides clear 
areas of focus as the industry continues to prioritize 
diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Institutional investors as catalysts  
for change
As key players in private markets, given the amount 
of capital IIs allocate annually to PE firms, IIs could 
be real catalysts for change on topics like diversity 
of talent in PE—if they decide this matters (for more 
on IIs, see sidebar “Institutional investors in the 
private market ecosystem”).

Based on our study, it seems they do. IIs are 
increasingly asking for and receiving diversity data 
from PE firms seeking to raise funds. Moreover, 
once a PE firm begins to provide diversity data as 
part of fundraising, the firm is likely to continue 
providing diversity data for subsequent funds’ 
capital raises. The director of environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) of a US-headquartered 
PE firm said, “We used to get a lot more requests 
on emissions and environmental metrics than on 
diversity. But there has been an uptick in DE&I 
requests, and we share what we are doing, and talk 
about the initiatives we have in place.”

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022

Institutional investors in the private market ecosystem

“Institutional investors” is a broad term 
used to describe a range of types of 
companies that manage assets of groups, 
typically by allocating capital to various 
investment vehicles to grow value over 
time. Here we use the term IIs to include, 
but not limit to, state or local pensions (for 
example, for teachers or police), Sovereign 
Wealth Funds, Private Family Offices, 
Foundations, Endowments, Real Estate 

funds, lenders, growth or expansion funds, 
hedge funds, and venture funds.

for instance) for the companies they will 
deploy this capital to.

These IIs often directly allocate capital to 
various Private Equity companies when 
they are raising funds for a new tranche 
of investments. These Funds often have 
specific themes (for example, Buyout) 
and even at times a strategic focus (this 
could be based on industry or geography, 

Since PE funds raise significant capital from 
IIs, they are motivated to align their actions 
and strategies to IIs’ priorities, especially 
during capital raises. Data PE funds provide 
during fundraising can range from past funds’ 
performance to the talent composition of 
investment teams and firms’ ICs.

The main challenge for both the IIs and PE firms is 
a lack of standardized metrics, which makes the 
reporting process unwieldy and labor-intensive for 
PE firms. As the head of DE&I at a midsize US PE firm 
said, “I am a big proponent of the need to streamline 
and consolidate what we are asked to report. It is 
hard for organizations like ours to respond to so many 
requests for different data in different forms.”

Meanwhile, IIs are left to wade through a mix of data 
from multiple PE firms that is difficult to compare 

and therefore often not able to be used in allocation 
decision making.

The consensus among IIs that participated in our 
survey is that the state of diversity in PE today 
is poor. IIs believe that PE firms have significant 
opportunity to improve the representation of 
underrepresented groups on their investing teams, 
specifically on the dimensions of gender, ethnicity 
and race, socioeconomic background, and sexual 
orientation (Exhibit 1).

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022IIs signaled that PE firms could do more to diversify 
their ICs and the management teams at the helm 
of portfolio companies where they hold majority 
ownership (Exhibit 2).

Standardizing diversity metrics will take time. 
However, it is clear that IIs are increasingly 
considering PE investing teams’ diversity in capital 
allocation decisions. Will Goodwin, Head of Direct 
Investments at New Zealand super fund said, “When 
we look to allocate, we ask PE funds for statistics on 
DE&I, such as gender pay gap and representation. 
In our opinion, programs, like parental leave, are just 
good hygiene and table stakes these days.”

While the sample size of IIs was small, our data 
suggests that the diversity premium can be 
significant in some scenarios. Ten chief investment 
officers representing IIs with assets under 
management (AUM) ranging from $20 billion to 
$460 billion were asked to allocate a fixed amount 
of capital between two hypothetical PE funds. 
When two hypothetical PE firms had identical 

metrics except for the investing team’s diversity, on 
average, IIs would allocate twice as much capital to 
the deal team with more gender diversity and 2.6 
times as much to the team with more ethnic and 
racial diversity. Not only would the more diverse 
deal team receive more money, all else equal, the 
data suggested there may be a penalty for PE firms 
that lag peers on diverse talent: one II reported 
that they would not allocate any funding to the less 
diverse PE fund when the alternate funds’ historical 
performance was the same.

Surprisingly, in a scenario where the diversity leader 
lagged on historic performance rate, 40 percent 
of IIs still allocated more capital to the PE firm 
with greater gender diversity, in spite of its lower 
historic returns; 50 percent of IIs allocated more 
to the firm with lower historic returns but higher 
ethnic and racial diversity. Given the challenges of 
gathering data and comparing apples-to-apples 
metrics from all firms, it is too soon to quantify the 
extent to which this is occurring today in IIs’ actual 
allocating. However, responses from surveyed IIs

and a willingness to allocate accordingly exists if 
the comparative diversity data and historic fund 
performance is provided by PE firms.

Gender diversity in global private equity
Globally, PE firms have almost achieved gender 
parity in entry-level roles. As of year-end 2021, 
48 percent of all entry-level roles in PE globally 
are filled by women (for more on job levels, see 
sidebar “Job levels in private equity”). However, 
disaggregating this figure into investing and non-
investing employees reveals only 34 percent of 
entry-level investing roles are held by women, 
compared to 57 percent in non-investing entry- 
level roles (Exhibit 3).

Women in PE continue to experience obstacles to 
their career advancement. The share of minorities 
(on the dimensions of gender, ethnicity/race, or 
an intersection) within PE Investing teams often 
declines with seniority. One consequential result 
is that even senior women struggle to break into 
“the room where it happens” in PE: today, women 
make up only 9 percent of IC members despite 
comprising about 12 percent of managing director-
level investment staff (L2) and 14 percent of C-suite 
roles (L1) (Exhibit 4). (For more on the role of ICs, see 
sidebar “The role of investment committees in the 
private equity industry.”)

The fact that women’s representation on ICs is lower 
than their presence in these senior ranks (ie, L1 
and L2) may reveal an unspoken cultural dynamic

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022Job levels in private equity

We classify jobs in private equity into six levels. For most of these levels, we include 
multiple possible job titles. In descending order of seniority, the roles are:

L1. C-level executives and fund  
heads. We will be referring to this level  
as the C-level.

L3. Principals, directors, and senior  
vice presidents. We refer to jobs at this 
level as principals.

L5. Associates and managers. We refer  
to these as associates.

L6. Entry level.

L2. Managing directors or partners.  
We will refer to jobs at this level as 
managing directors.

L4. Vice presidents and senior managers. 
We refer to these jobs as VPs.

For the sake of simplicity, we will refer  
to each level with only one title.

compared to the industry average of 23 percent 
(Exhibit 5).

Globally, gender diversity in investing, particularly 
at the senior levels of PE firms, has a ways to go. Yet 
even today there is a significant spread among PE 
firms that lead on gender diversity and those that 
trail. When looking at the MD level (L2), the top 10 
percent of PE firms on gender diversity average 32 
percent investing women MDs, while the bottom 10 
percent of firms in 2021 had zero investing women 
MDs. What’s more, women’s representation at the 
top seems to impact gender diversity throughout 
the organization: PE firms that lead on percent of 
women MDs also had significantly higher shares 
of total investing women versus the industry as a 
whole—a difference of 10 percentage points higher 

Regional differences in gender diversity
The dynamics of the PE industry as a whole may 
affect the number of women in investing. However, 
regional variations also exist (Exhibit 6).

These regional differences impact different levels 
within the PE hierarchy.

PE offices in the Americas have low share of women 
in entry- and associate-level investing roles
PE offices in the Americas have the highest share 
of women in the C-suite and possibly the least 
obstacles to female advancement, with the smallest 
drop-off in share of women from associate (L5) 
to MD (L2); APAC leads the regions in women’s

representation in the middle of the corporate ladder 
(L5 and L4); and Europe leads slightly at entry-level 
investing roles (L6).

Offices in the Americas boast the highest share 
of women in top-of-the-house roles: the share of 
women in the equivalent of the C-suite is 15 percent. 
Moreover, of the regions, offices in the Americas 
have the smallest drop today (12 percentage points) 
between the share of women in Investing at the 
associate level (L5, at 25 percent) and the MD level 
(L2, at 13 percent). However, the region also ties with 
APAC for lowest share of women at the entry level (L6) 
and Europe for lowest share at post-MBA associate 
(L5) level. While American PE does comparatively well 
with retention and promotion of Investing women, this 
small base of women entering the profession may 
constrain progress in the ability to advance a greater 
share of women to MD over time.

APAC offices have the highest share of women at 
the mid-level
APAC leads the regions in share of women investors 
at post-MBA associate (L5) and VP (L4) ranks. 
Representation for women at the associate level 
(L5) in APAC offices is 31 percent, five percentage 
points higher than the global benchmark; and 
representation for women at the VP level (L4) is 
40 percent, 11 percentage points higher than the 
global benchmark. However, 2021 data shows a 
“broken rung” in the career progression for women 

in APAC offices, as the share of women plunges by 
more than 30 percentage points in the step up from 
VP (L4) to principal (L3); that is a 4.2x drop in the 
percentage of women advancing to principal (L3) in 
APAC offices. This broken rung for women from VP 
to principal was made more severe by a promotion 
gap between women and men (2 percent women vs 
20 percent men from the available pool promoted) in 
2021 and attrition of women at the L3 level in APAC.

European offices have the highest share of 
women at entry-level Investing
Europe leads the regions, though marginally, in women 
entering in entry-level Investing jobs, with 35 percent. 
However, women in Europe at the MD (L2) level have 
the lowest representation—7 percent—compared to 
all other regions and the steepest decline from post-
MBA associate level, with a 17-percentage point drop 
from L5 to L2. Given more than a third of entry-level 
investing staff are women, European PE offices have 
a real opportunity to improve their gender diversity at 
the higher ranks by evaluating sponsorship throughout 
the funnel and promotion rates of women out of the 
entry-level Investing role. However, there are positive 
signs. In 2021, Europe has the smallest gap compared 
to other regions between promotion rates for men and 
women at the mid-level to senior ranks. Even though 
promotions still favor men, in Europe, the difference in 
promotion rates between men and women into VP and 
principal is less than four percentage points.

The role of investment committees in the private equity industry

In private equity (PE), ICs are where 
investment decisions happen. Firms often 
take pride in their IC process. The intellectual 
debate and discussions that occur over 
potential assets to purchase, prices to pay, 
the level of EBITDA growth needed over the 
holding period, and how to create that value, 
all are raised and decided in ICs.

While several other operations—such 
as raising new funds or setting their 
investment strategies—are of comparable 
importance, the discussions and decisions 
made in regular IC meetings form the 
intellectual backbone of PE firms. Therefore, 
who consistently sits at the IC table matters.

Standing IC members are generally invited 
from the C-Suite (L1) and MD (L2) ranks.

Successes and challenges for ethnic 
and racial minorities echo those  
facing women
Based on data from PE firms’ US and Canadian offices, 
like women, ethnic and racial minorities only make up 
9 percent of IC members even though they make up 
almost 17 percent of Investing MDs (L2) (Exhibit 7).

White or Caucasian (hereafter “White”) professionals 
remain the largest group in Investing roles in Canada 
and the United States. They hold 70 percent of all 
investing jobs, with White men being more than eight 
times as likely as White women to be MD (L2).

People of Asian descent (hereafter “Asian 
professionals”) are the largest racial minority group 
in PE Investing roles. They hold 28 percent of these 
Investing roles at the associate level. However, the 
share of Asian investing professionals declines to 12 
percent at the MD level. Asians’ share of investing 

roles remains around or above 22 percent until it 
drops seven percentage points from the VP (L4) into 
the principal level (L3)—and even further thereafter 
to 12 percent of MDs and 5 percent at the C-suite 
level. It also should be noted that Asians are the 
only ethnic and racial minority whose share of roles 
declines substantially from L2 to L1—as White, 
Black, and Hispanic/Latino/Mestizo (hereafter 
“Hispanic”) representation increases or remains 
relatively constant from the MD to C-suite levels.

On the surface, Black and Hispanic professionals 
have similarly low representation across all levels 
of PE investing, starting at 4 to 7 percent of the 
entry and post-MBA associate levels. Both groups 
also lose roughly three to four percentage points 
from post-MBA to MD levels (L5 to L2). With 3 
percent Hispanic and 1 percent Black principals 
(L3), PE lacks Hispanic or Black role models in the 
leadership ranks for more junior professionals. One

chief human resources officer (CHRO) commented, 
“If I were a Black person looking at PE, I don’t think 
I would see a lot of people who look like me, and I 
don’t know if I would want to work there.” Despite 
the low numbers of Hispanic and Black principals, 
each group retains the small share through the 
top leadership ranks, with 3 percent and 1 percent 
of leaders, respectively, in MD and C-suite roles. 
However, looking more closely at the trends, there 
are some differences in the Black and Hispanic 
experience in PE.

Black professionals comprise 7 percent of entry-level 
Investing roles, close to double the share of Hispanic 
professionals. This number drops sharply to 4 percent 
for the associate (L5) class in the US and Canadian 
PE offices. Black gender composition seems to 
mimic the overall PE Investing gender story only at 
the post MBA and VP levels, where Black women are 
just under a third of all Black Investing professionals. 
As of the end of 2021, only 1 percent of all PE MDs 
(L2) in these offices were Black, significantly lacking 
representation from Black women. That share of 
Black women does increase slightly in the C-suite—
though Black representation (men and women) is 
still only a little over 1 percent of all US and Canadian 
reporting firms.

The Hispanic experience in PE Investing also begins 
with low representation in entry-level investing roles, 
at 4 percent. However, unlike Black professionals, 
this number grows to 7 percent at the post-MBA 
associate (L5) rank. Thereafter, there is more 
Hispanic talent compared to Black talent at senior 
levels of PE firms, with 2.5 times and 3.9 times as 
many Hispanic principals and MDs, respectively. 
And yet, despite comprising 3 percent of MD and 
C-suite roles, Hispanic representation on ICs was 
less than 1 percent. The gender imbalance for 
Hispanic professionals in PE Investing is larger 
than it is for Black professionals: Hispanic women 
only comprise about 16 percent of Hispanic 
professionals from post-MBA to principal (L5 to L3), 
dropping by nine percentage points to 7 percent of 
all Hispanic MDs. While it is clear that PE firms could 
work on attracting Hispanic and Black professionals, 
the data shows there is the most room to improve 
in attracting post-MBA Hispanic women, in 

particular; firms are also falling short in retention 
and promotion of Black and Hispanic women at the 
principal and MD levels.

However, this analysis speaks to the industry 
averages on ethnicity and race in Canada and the 
United States. Of course, there is a spectrum of 
PE firms, with the top firms close to doubling the 
industry average share of ethnic and racial minorities 
at the MD level, with 32 percent, while more than 
98 percent of MDs at the least diverse firms are 
White/Caucasian. As we saw with gender, diversity 
at the top does have an impact on the ability to retain 
diverse talent throughout the deal team (Exhibit 8).

While the industry average was 30 percent people 
from ethnic and racial minorities, industry laggards 
on MD-level ethnic and racial diversity were, on 
average, eight percentage points below industry 
average, at 22 percent ethnic and racial minorities 
across their entire investing team.

The path forward
Our findings suggest a few critical areas for leaders who 
want to make progress toward diversifying the industry:

1. 

 Evaluate IC diversity. PE firms should take 
a critical lens to the diversity of their ICs to 
understand if and why they are not more 
reflective of the makeup of their C-Suite and 
managing directors.

2.  Consider region-specific obstacles to diversity:

•  Offices in the Americas could strive for 

gender parity in hiring and attract more Black 
and Hispanic talent for post-MBA investing 
positions. PE firms may need to take a critical 
look at possible causes, such as barriers to 
entry or an unattractive culture, that results 
in low levels of representation of Black and 
Hispanic professionals even at entry levels of 
firms’ deal teams. For the current talent pool, 
firms could continue to improve promotion 
parity of women, Asian professionals, and 
Hispanics professionals into VP, principal, and 
MD roles.

•  APAC offices can mend the broken rung 

from VP to principal by evaluating barriers to 
apprenticeship, sponsorship, and promotion 
of women, as well as by working to reduce MD 
and principal female attrition.

•  European offices may reduce the loss of 
women from L5 to L2 and leverage the 

breadth of their women colleagues at L6, by 
striving for promotion parity for that first step 
up from entry level to associate level, as well 
as in external hiring for mid-tenure levels

3.   Gather more intersectional diversity data. PE 
firms’ CHROs and Heads of DEI should push to 
improve the granularity of the data collected 
around the world, where possible, and devise 
solutions with these intersectional groups in mind.

4. 

 IIs can use standardized—and simplified—
diversity metrics to evaluate PE funds. This 
will likely require collaboration among IIs. 
Furthermore, if not already asking, IIs should 
consistently require diversity metrics from all 
PE firms that approach them during fundraising.

Increasing the diversity of PE Investing teams takes 
time. While there are no quick fixes, the value to be 
gained by taking effective action could motivate 
sustained focus on the goal. Creating an equitable 
and inclusive culture will be the key to retaining a 
diverse workforce over time. The Head of HR for a 
European firm shared, “By humanizing the culture a 
bit more, we will be able to make private equity firms 
a place to spend a career for reasons beyond just 
money. By doing that, you may automatically get more 
diverse talent, including at the most senior levels.”

Jerilyn Castillo McAniff, Head of D&I at Oaktree 
Capital Management, L.P., a global investment 
manager specializing in alternative investments, 
said, “What we need are consistent metrics and 
industry benchmarks so that firms can track 
representation and progress. Without these tools, 
we all operate in a vacuum. We can all do our part 
by participating in relevant industry studies and 
benchmarks, which gather data, track trends, and 
highlight key themes. Making progress will be a 
collective effort.”

Building a more diverse set of leaders at the helm 
of the private markets industry requires sustained, 
nuanced, long-term effort. However, this research 
shows that progress is being intentionally made 
across several PE firms; and rewards come with 
that diversity, as IIs continue to prioritize and seek 
diverse talent to allocate their money to.

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022‘If you’re going to build 
something from scratch, 
this might be as good  
a time as in a decade’

In an interview with the editorial director of the McKinsey Quarterly, venture 
capitalist Bill Gurley explains the promise and perils facing start-ups at a 
moment of economic uncertainty and reveals why hybrid work may be the 
most interesting technology of all.”

Bill Gurley is one of Silicon Valley’s most 
respected venture capitalists. As a general partner 
at Benchmark, Gurley has backed a blessing of 
unicorns, including Grubhub, Liveops, Nextdoor, 
OpenTable, and, most famously, Uber. 

Gurley has often been a voice of reason amid Silicon 
Valley overexuberance and has tweeted regularly 
in 2022 about the need for start-ups to be realistic 
about the current economic environment. While 
many venture firms have a lot of money to invest, 
dealmaking has slowed considerably this year. 
Average valuations of some fundraising rounds 
have dropped as investors adjust to an economic 
slowdown and look warily ahead. But being realistic 
doesn’t necessarily mean being pessimistic: in some 
ways, says Gurley, this may be a great time to launch 
a start-up. Gurley recently joined Quarterly editorial 
director Rick Tetzeli for a wide-ranging discussion. 
An edited version of their conversation follows.

Rick Tetzeli: Thanks so much for joining me to talk 
about start-ups at what seems to be a particularly 
challenging moment. As if to prove the point, an alert 
just popped up on my screen: Robinhood is laying off 
23 percent of its workforce.

Bill Gurley: Wow. Layoffs happen so infrequently. In 
’01 and ’09, you had broadscale layoffs, but only now 
are we starting to see them this time around. Well, 23 
percent is getting into a range that actually makes 
sense. Is this their second layoff?

Rick Tetzeli: Yes, unfortunately. They did 9 percent 
earlier.

Bill Gurley: See, that’s the thing. I hate the 5 to 10 
percent layoffs. You don’t get any material impact to 
lowering your expenses. Yet you get all the cultural 
negatives of having done a layoff. You get 100 
percent of the pain and very little gain. And then 
you’re in retweet land—you end up with two or three 
of them. Anyway, that wasn’t on your original list of 
questions.

Rick Tetzeli: No, it’s not. It just happened. But it’s a 
bracing lead-in to talking about how difficult things 
might be for start-ups during what seems to be a 

time of great uncertainty. Many people feel that 
the externalities affecting so many businesses—
whether it’s the war in Ukraine, inflation, geopolitics, 
changing labor patterns—seem more complicated 
now than they have been in a long time. Do you agree 
with that? Do you think we’re entering a period of 
extended uncertainty?

Bill Gurley: It’s funny. Three or four years ago, I felt, 
like many others, that the really big problem was 
the zero-interest-rate thing, this prolonged period 
of near-zero interest rates. I even paid a massive 
amount of money to end up at this dinner with 
Warren Buffett, where we each got to ask him one 
question. My question was, “You know, if interest 
rates are zero, (1) your DCF model [which emphasizes 
discounted cash flow as the basis of valuations] 
doesn’t work, and (2) it drives all kind of speculation.” 
And he said, “You betcha!” 

I also spent time tracking down Howard Marks and 
Stanley Druckenmiller because I think there are 
so few people who have proven that they have a 
valuable point of view on macro. There are just so 
many variables with macro. You can fool yourself. I’ve 
felt that ever since my MBA macro class. 

So I’m hesitant to answer your question. That 
said, clearly you’ve had rates going up, which 
hasn’t happened in a very long time. That has had 
consequences on car loans and mortgages and 
corporate debt. And it should rein in speculation—it 
probably has already. China decoupling from the 
West is pretty scary, given that sharing and trading 
has a positive impact for both societies. If that 
were to escalate simultaneously with, say, Europe 
getting worse and maybe something in Taiwan being 
provoked, that could all be super bad. 

Having said all that, I have two things in the back of 
my mind that relate to start-ups and the start-up 
ecosystem.

First, Stephen Covey used to talk about your circle 
of influence, and Buffett talks about your circle 
of competence. Macro things are not things that 
start-ups can impact or control. So there’s not 
much reason for them to affect your thoughts about 

36

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022whether you would start a company or not. They 
might add anxiety, but I don’t know that they have 
any real impact.

Rick Tetzeli: Because it’s still about the idea. And 
the idea is good regardless.

Bill Gurley: Right. Second, the environment for 
launching a start-up was really crazy the past five 
years. And the truth is that if you’re going to build 
something from scratch, this might be as good a time 
as you’ve had in a decade. 

Real estate? You can get all the real estate you 
want. People used to fret about lease cost, but 
that’s all gone. And while people get caught up on 
whether the money’s cheap or not, getting rid of the 
distraction of all that cheap money may be a good 
thing. That whole mentality of, oh, your competitor 
raised $100 million, now you have to raise $100 
million. All those things have evaporated—for the 
better, I’d say.

A huge thing is that your access to talent is way 
better. It was so hard to get, but now it’s a lot cheaper 
than it was. There are layoffs happening. And then 
hybrid has opened up the people you can get. 
I’ve heard some pretty amazing stories. Jennifer 
Tejada, who runs PagerDuty, says they went into 
the pandemic at 85 percent Bay Area employees 
and came out at 25 percent. If you need an iOS 
programmer within 20 miles of your Silicon Valley 
location, that’s way harder than if you can shop 
globally for that.

Rick Tetzeli: Let’s stick with hybrid for a second. Do 
you think it will affect the culture of start-ups? 

Bill Gurley: Whether hybrid is good or bad is one of 
the biggest unknowns coming out of the pandemic. 
There are some pretty hard-core enterprise-type 
founders who say, “Everyone’s back in the office.” 
And then there are people whose business is 
positively impacted by hybrid work. It’s all over the 
map. I remember asking [Matt Mullenweg,] the CEO 
of WordPress, which has been 100 percent hybrid 

its whole life, about this before the pandemic. And 
he said that you need to be all or nothing, that when 
you’re in the middle ground you get into these weird 
cases of cultural confusion, where, for example, 
cliques can develop if someone’s not there. That’s 
why some people have a rule: all in person or no one 
in person. But I don’t know what makes sense.

The number-one thing people at start-ups worry 
about is missing out on serendipity—just some 
random conversation between two people who 
were out visiting a customer and then said, “Oh, wait, 
what if we did this?” and it becomes critical to the 
company’s success. That’s far more likely in a start-
up than in a big company. But, ultimately, hybrid is 
really a founder-centric decision. 

Rick Tetzeli: The pace of IPOs has slowed 
enormously this year, and valuations have collapsed. 
Earlier this year, you tweeted, “An entire generation 
of entrepreneurs and tech investors built their 
perspective on valuations during the second half of 
an amazing bull market run. The ‘unlearning’ process 
could be painful, surprising, and unsettling to many.”1 
Is this a reset like 2001 and 2008–09? How painful 
might it be? And have you learned things from the 
past downturns that apply here?

Bill Gurley: This one is different in a couple of ways. 
In 2001, there were a lot of nascent companies 
going public with, like, $1 million in revenue. That’s 
not the case this time around. Here, you’ve had a lot 
of companies with huge amounts of revenue, some 
with massive losses. There has been a huge volume 
of capital, and the scale of the companies is radically 
different. Some have raised $500 billion, $3 billion—
there was no precedent for sums like that. And some 
of that money might be dead money.

Then there’s the fact that this run went on longer 
than people thought. That may well make the pain 
a little bit bigger. It also means that there’s less 
institutional memory.

The collective venture community needs to get its 
head around the new reality as fast as possible. The

more people see what’s really going on, the quicker 
that will happen. In ’09, the response to the downturn 
was pretty swift. But you had the benefit that ’01 was 
only seven or eight years in the rearview mirror. While 
there’s still some institutional memory around the 
Valley, it’s been a very long time since 2009.

Rick Tetzeli: So what are you telling your portfolio 
companies? 

with that, the better you’ll do. That’s just pragmatic. 
This goes back to the very first topic we talked about, 
layoffs. If you’re going to do it, how material does it 
need to be?

Rick Tetzeli: Layoffs, of course, can be particularly 
tough on a company. Don’t you ever worry that 
people could cut too aggressively at this point?

Bill Gurley: I try to convey that they need to get in 
front of this. In a couple meetings, I’ve heard an owner 
or founder say, “Well, you know, we just need to 
buckle down until things get back to where they were.” 
And I’m, like, “No, the fantasy was the past five years.” 

What we’re in now may just be normal, right? This 
may be average. And that’s very hard for people. It’s 
especially hard for a founder.

This will sound trite, but a founder who, say, owns 15 
percent of a company that raised a round at $1 billion 
has done the math. They’ve mentally banked that 
they’re worth $150 million—pretax, of course, but 
they forget that. But now, they’re not! And it’s just 
super hard for them to accept that that was from a 
fantastical time that’s probably behind us.

Rick Tetzeli: So how does that personal shock of 
going from being worth $150 million to being worth 
$50 million—

Bill Gurley: Or $15 million—

Rick Tetzeli: How does that affect how they manage?

Bill Gurley: Well, if they’re in denial they can make 
a lot of mistakes. They don’t cut enough cost. They 
don’t lay off enough people. They continue to think 
they can just go raise money, but they don’t realize 
their cost of capital has changed by 5x. If they do not 
fully understand the situation they’re in, that’s super 
problematic.

You have to play the game on the field. If everything 
has reset, it has reset. The sooner you get in touch 

Bill Gurley: I’ve never seen that in my history. 
Everybody says, “We’re getting to the bone.” 
Everyone says that. And I know it’s a touchy subject 
because people are losing their jobs. But companies—
even small start-ups—are way more resilient than 
people realize. It’s the norm that you cut 30 percent, 
and everything keeps going. You don’t lose all your 
customers. And some people find, “Oh, wait, we’re 
moving a little faster.” Sometimes things get better. I 
mean, yes, eventually some companies go bankrupt. 
But I’ve never seen someone do too much. You can 
always hire back. I think 95 percent of the time, the 
failure is the other way, of not doing enough.

Rick Tetzeli: You’ve tweeted that “Benchmark never 
changes our investment cycle due to economic 
swings.”2 Why? 

Bill Gurley: Well, our firm has a very unique focus. 
Around 85 to 90 percent of our funds are deployed 
on first-money and early-stage investments. And our 
approach has become even more unique because so 
many of our competitors have gone multistage.

And once you start doing late-stage things, the 
current environment has a drastic impact. But if 
you’re doing early-stage, these kinds of swings don’t 
really put you off the next incremental investment. 
There have been plenty of great companies started 
in the troughs to suggest that there’s no reason to 
stop investing. 

The same thing is true at the peaks. There were 
firms that pulled out in ’96 because they thought 
things had expanded too broadly, and they missed 
three of the greatest years of returns in the history 
of the business. 

2 Bill Gurley (@bgurley), Twitter, June 20, 2022, 6:15 p.m. 

38

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022We really try to learn from our mistakes. We tried 
to expand internationally once, but it didn’t work 
for us. So in about 2006, 2007, we capitulated and 
went back. And our conviction in our focus was even 
stronger, because we saw that we did better work 
once we refocused.

We had that on our mind as everyone in the Valley 
started expanding in more recent times. And I will tell 
you, for the six or seven years prior to the past year, 
people would meet with us and tell us that we were 
stupid, that we were leaving money on the table. But 
in the past six months, that’s all reverted. Now it’s all, 
oh, you guys are still brilliant.

There is another reason why I like our model. We’re 
running much smaller funds than some of our peers, 
who probably pull down ten times the capital we do 
each year. Those firms have massive management 
fees as a result. As an investor, I just take more pride 
in us doing well when our limited partners are doing 
well. So if the majority of our compensation is on the 
carry side instead of the fee side, I just feel better 
about it.

Rick Tetzeli: Are companies still coming to you 
seeking frothy valuations, or has that changed from 
a year ago?

Bill Gurley: I think we’re partially corrected. It takes 
a while for people to come around to the fact that 
everything’s been reset. It’s a slow process. It’s also 
why M&A is delayed. People think, “Oh, everything’s 
peaked,” so M&A should just take off now. But like 
founders with valuations, late-stage investors that 
invested at a certain number aren’t going to like it if 
you try and sell the company at a third of the price 
they paid. So things are slow to get corrected.

Rick Tetzeli: You’ve been pushing for direct listings 
and other nontraditional ways of going public. Do you 
think that has become a fully accepted part of the 
game? Do you think these methods will become even 
more customary going forward?

Bill Gurley: I hope so. Both the NYSE and the 
Nasdaq have been approved for direct listings with a 
set of parameters that are still being worked on. But 

with the market resetting, I don’t think this is on the 
SEC’s [US Securities and Exchange Commission] 
priority list. They’ve got other issues at the forefront.

There is definitely a category of founders who have 
the financial knowledge of how markets work and 
how markets should work that prefer it. They know 
that it’s ridiculous that a human would pick the price 
and the allocation when an algorithm can do it in an 
auction. I remain convinced that eventually everyone 
will do it. 

Rick Tetzeli: Is the Bay Area still the hub of 
everything tech, the way it was when you moved out 
there 25 years ago?

Bill Gurley: First of all, there are places that have 
had incremental success over the last two decades. 
Seattle has just been phenomenal for start-ups. New 
York has had a couple of really big wins. So things 
have already opened up.

Hybrid creates a much bigger question mark for the 
Bay Area. 

The number-one risk of being outside the Valley was 
always, “Can I get the executive talent?” You could 
always get programmers. You could always get 
customer support people. Now, with hybrid, maybe 
you can get the executive talent, too. Found your 
company in Chicago and hire your executive talent 
even if they want to keep living in the Bay Area.

The other thing that has reinforced the Bay Area 
is that, culturally, everywhere you go, you run into 
someone connected to the industry. That creates 
a ton of serendipity outside the office. It leads to 
companies being started and people changing jobs, 
and it leads to idea propagation. Matt Ridley talks 
about ideas having sex and how that can impact 
innovation and increase productivity. Silicon Valley is 
a great example of that. 

The ideas that are relevant can be very ephemeral 
and fleeting. Take something like knowing how to 
gain customers on an iOS app. You could have been 
a marketing guru for 20 years, but if you went on 
vacation for five years and then came back, you 

‘If you’re going to build something from scratch, this might be as good a time as in a decade’

39

know nothing, right? You know nothing. There’s a 
constant reinforcement of what’s happening that has 
always been an advantage to being in the Valley.

Well, if you’re working on, say, a Web3 project these 
days, you’re probably doing so on a Discord channel. 
They’re all working in Discord. And so that’s where 
you’re having those moments where ideas might 
have sex on a constant, daily basis, in a Slack-like 
way that cuts out geography. That’s really interesting.

Rick Tetzeli: You mentioned Web3. We haven’t 
talked much about technology per se, but I’m 
wondering if before we close you could tell me what 
is the most promising tech trend that you’re looking 
at right now? Is it Web3 or crypto or some of the 
other things we hear about? Or is there something 
else that has the greatest potential?

Bill Gurley: For me, personally—I’m not speaking for 
my firm—I’m most motivated by all this stuff we’ve 
been talking about around hybrid and the fact that I 
can hire someone from around the globe instead of 
20 miles from my office. Think about the productivity 
and innovation unlock that that might create. There 

are all kinds of problems that entrepreneurs need to 
solve. How do you get the serendipity back? How do 
you measure productivity? These kinds of Slack- and 
Zoom- next-generation things are super interesting 
to me. For instance, I would think that there should 
be some kind of new version of LinkedIn because of 
all this. 

On crypto, there’s a moment of reckoning right 
now that I think is highly dependent on regulatory 
ambiguity and what happens in Washington. We’re 
kind of stuck until that is clarified.

I also think that the crypto industry is in desperate 
need of some hard-core proof points. There’s a lot of 
rhetoric. I mean, as everyone says, Bitcoin is its own 
thing. It is a proven, hard-core protection against 
your government coming after your money. You 
could theoretically escape a dictatorial or tyrannical 
country with your money on this thing—reemerge 
elsewhere and still have your money. That’s a real 
feature that has been obtained, and people can 
bet on whether that’s valuable. I would call it an 
achievement. But I don’t know how many other 
achievements there have been.

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022Infrastructure investing 
will never be the same

Traditionally staid and stable, infrastructure investing has been shaken up 
by revolutions in energy, mobility, and digitization, making it imperative for 
investors to reassess the strategy’s risk and return dynamics.

Infrastructure investing has long offered 
investors the best of both worlds: low-maintenance 
investments with predictable risk profiles and strong, 
consistent returns, even through chaotic periods.

The past few months have been turbulent, with 
significant inflation, increases in interest rates, 
declining equity markets, and a looming threat  
of recession. This uncertain panorama comes on  
the heels of the deep disruptions caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic. While infrastructure 
investments are seen as better able than other 
investments to withstand such pressures, investors 
in the asset class still have to deal with the impact of 
structural shifts in the economic environment.

Meanwhile, there are deeper, more gradual ways in 
which the asset class is changing—and investors 
need to change with it. Revolutions in energy, 
mobility, and digitization are introducing new 
dynamics to existing infrastructure investments that 
previously appeared almost impervious to change. At 
the same time, economic and social transformations 
are introducing new types of investments that 
represent opportunity for investors.

The infrastructure shake-up and the unpredictable 
pace at which the energy transition is unfolding 
require investors to scrutinize their existing 
portfolios and ensure that assets are correctly 
rated for risk/return. Some investments viewed as 
low-risk, low-return “super core” assets may carry 
more risk than is currently understood, particularly 
as entire fuel sources and related assets are phased 
out of the economy. On the other hand, maturing 
network technology, combined with large-scale 
social changes such as the acceptance of remote 
working, have moved some digital assets down the 
risk spectrum. Investors need to understand which 
categories assets belong to today and adjust their 
portfolios accordingly.

Exposure to new types of infrastructure assets 
demands that investors manage higher levels of risk. 

Many next-generation investments are self-evident, 
such as electric-vehicle (EV) charging networks, 
battery storage, hydrogen distribution, and smart 
motorway and rail technology, 5G telecom networks, 
and data centers. These assets offer many of the 
characteristics that infrastructure investors look 
for: real assets, protected market positions, and the 
potential to generate stable cash yields. However, to 
get exposure to these new asset classes, investors 
will have to accept a period of significant investment 
and negative cash flow, along with development, 
technology, and commercial risks.

Benefiting from emerging opportunities calls for 
more active investing. It can be hard to come by 
alternative-energy infrastructure deals that meet 
even the modest $200 million minimum ticket 
size for many investors. The few that do are often 
exorbitantly priced, with EBITDA multiples reaching 
the mid-20s in some cases. To participate in the 
energy transition, investors will need to source deals 
more creatively and be willing to build businesses. 
For decades, returns from infrastructure investing 
have been more stable than those in both public 
and private equity markets and have provided a 
comforting record of success. But hidden within the 
steady graph lines are pockets of value destruction 
that should serve as a warning against complacency. 
By being aware of the factors causing the sea 
change in infrastructure, and knowing what pivots 
to make in response, investors can best prepare for 
the future.

The infrastructure shake-up requires 
investors to scrutinize assets’ risk/
return profile
Traditional risk-based classifications are being 
challenged by fundamental drivers led by the energy 
transition, including sustainability targets, electric 
mobility, and digitization. These forces mean that 
investors should assess the risk/return profile of 
specific assets and potentially recategorize them to 
account for new sources of both risk and growth.

42

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022Infrastructure’s traditional taxonomy
As the infrastructure investment sector matured 
over the last few decades, the asset class branched 
into funds in three categories: super core, core, and 
core-plus.

Super-core investments are the lowest risk  
and lowest return. Traditionally, super core has 
included assets such as regulated utilities— 
which have regulated tariffs and little volume 
variation—and availability-based public–private 
partnership projects.

Core investments are relatively low risk and low 
return. Traditional assets in this category have 
included nonregulated oil pipelines and demand-
risk transport-related assets such as toll roads, 
highways, and airports. Some assets that were of 
little interest to infrastructure investors a few years 
back, such as fiber-optic technology and telecom 
towers, are now considered core infrastructure.

Core-plus investments carry more risks and can 
offer returns approaching those of private equity 
investments, at 15 percent or more. Such assets 
mimic the characteristics of classic infrastructure 
investments (see sidebar, “What is a classic 
infrastructure investment?”) but are not universally 
considered part of the asset class. Fish transport, 
holiday villages, and crematoria are examples of 
core-plus assets.

Reassessing risk and return
In the past, individual assets sometimes moved up or 
down the risk/return spectrum. But with changes in 
energy, mobility, and digitization, more assets need 
to be reassessed: assets that have long dwelled 
squarely within an asset subcategory may need to 
move to a different bucket today, and there may be 
big shifts from super core all the way to core-plus. 
Dramatic reshuffling is occurring because assets 
that were once seen as immutably stable, such as 
gas pipelines, are now exposed to significant energy 
transition risk.

What is a classic infrastructure investment?

Historically, infrastructure investors 
have looked for investments that have 
the following attributes:

 — are downside protected (meaning 

they will perform well irrespective of 
the economic cycle)

 — are real, capex-intensive assets 
(something you can touch; that is 
anchored in the ground)

 — are essential services (such as energy 
provision or transport infrastructure)

 — provide cash yields (something that 
is operational, profitable, and has 
sufficient cash flow to pay back to the 
shareholders) driven by high EBITDA 
margins that provide risk protection, 
a cushion for up-front capital 
expenditures, and higher leverage

 — offer steady and stable returns 
(and are not exposed to volatile 
commodity price markets or  
demand uncertainties)

 — have barriers to entry, either via  
a regulated monopoly or long- 
term contracts

 — are typically within energy (such as 
electricity or power distribution, oil 
pipelines and storage terminals, and 
renewables with power-purchase 
agreements); telecom (such as mobile 
towers, fiber, and data centers); 
transport (including seaports, 
airports, roads, and rail); and certain 
healthcare and education assets

Infrastructure investing will never be the same

43

Examples of recent asset subclass migrations 
include the following:

 — Gas networks carrying methane hydrocarbons, 
which in a net-zero transition would potentially 
need to be phased out in regions where gas is 
substituted for low-carbon alternatives: while 
hydrogen can utilize some of these assets, the 
general view is that gas distribution will be 
required less, and that additional money will 
need to be spent to repurpose the networks. 
These risks mean that gas distribution is moving 
from super core to core or even core-plus.

 — Digital infrastructure assets (such as mobile 

towers and fiber networks) that have moved down 
the risk spectrum as network communications 
technology matures: Digital assets now show 
returns that have moved them all the way from the 
core-plus to the super-core range.

 — Power networks, which typically have a 

regulated return and stable revenues, are seen 
as super core: However, growing investment 
demands create deployment and regulatory 
risks that need to be taken into account.

 — Motorway service areas (MSAs) that distribute 
fuel for internal-combustion engines (ICEs): as 
the number of EVs increase, fuel consumption 
for ICEs will likely decrease, but the greater need 
for EV charging stations presents a significant 
business opportunity for MSAs. This potential 
demand means that MSAs could move from 
core-plus to core.

A new era demands that investors 
change their approach
Investors should be aware of a broader sea change 
in the risk/return profile across the whole asset 
class. Investors have become accustomed to 
thinking of infrastructure as a haven. A record of 
steady returns relative to most other alternative

investors need to move beyond the historical 
underwriting approach that focused almost 
exclusively on relatively static technical assessments 
and financial models. Today, other factors need to be 
layered on for a full-picture understanding.

However, today there are relatively few assets that 
promise the steady returns that infrastructure 
investors became accustomed to in recent decades, 
leading investors to lower their expectations for 
future returns (Exhibit 2).

Moreover, infrastructure contains pockets of value 
destruction—most notably, downturns in telecom- 
and transport-related assets caused by the onset 
of the pandemic—that need to be managed wisely 
(Exhibit 3).

Investors should adopt a new approach  
to underwriting
To manage the new dynamics introduced by the 
energy transition and other structural changes, 

MSAs, for example, were traditionally evaluated 
based on traffic projections. While traffic is still 
important, the impact of EV charging means 
investors now need to understand factors including 
EV penetration, battery evolution, charging 
technology, and grid capacity.

Likewise, utilities’ diligence has moved beyond 
technical and regulatory assessments to complex 
modeling of the impact of the energy transition 
(for example, how hydrogen could be a potential 
replacement for pipelines that currently carry 
natural gas). These changes require deal teams to 
have a different set of skills and capabilities (or a set 
of experts that can apply its skills during diligence),

as well as a more proactive approach to developing 
an investment case.

Investors can use best-in-class asset 
management and technology to deliver  
superior returns
The days of sitting back and enjoying predictable, 
long-term yields have waned. The changing 
environment means that investors need to be more 
proactive about asset management, revisiting the 
risk/return dynamics of key asset classes to ensure 
that they have a current understanding of value 
drivers and trends.

years to trigger a complete reassessment of their 
portfolios and a fresh set of priority investment 
themes and theses. The speed and uncertainty 
of the energy transition, for example, can mean 
that several critical assumptions underpinning 
an investment (such as EV penetration) move 
in unpredictable directions and at unforeseen 
speed. Appropriate and timely interventions may 
be required to preserve value. Investors need 
to actively manage a complex menu of strategic, 
operational, and digital initiatives to ensure that 
assets deliver according to the management plan.

Large investors should recognize that there have 
been enough developments over the past two 

Smaller investors with a minority stake also need to 
be cognizant of, and respond suitably to, changing 
risk/return equations. In some cases, that could

over management to enforce a strategic shift, or if 
the new risk/return profile no longer matches their 
ingoing assessment.

Investors also need to use operational and digital 
levers to create buffers for inevitable downturns, 
and to correct course when fundamentals shift. 
Our experience suggests that investors can use 
digital interventions and analytics to achieve 
improvements in a range of situations including 
reducing airport congestion, enhancing predictive 
maintenance, reducing procurement spending, 
reducing hospital waiting times, and improving 
telecom network performance, among others.

investments need to be large. These concentrated 
funds are increasingly vying with one another to 
raise larger funds and maximize the size of assets 
under management (Exhibit 4). The upshot is intense 
competition for suitable infrastructure targets in a 
higher interest rate environment.

The energy transition is a prime example of a 
large-scale opportunity that could potentially be 
a recipient of these funds. The global economy 
needs an estimated $9.2 trillion in annual average 
investment in physical assets to achieve net-zero 
emissions by 2050.1 Yet this sector is growing fast 
from a small base, and there are still few investable 
targets at scale.

and wait for competition to die down, climate tech 
developers to scale, or emerging markets to mature. 
Instead, they can consider more active investing 
styles that put them in the driver’s seat.

One approach to sourcing proprietary deals is 
though detailed insights into niche markets versus 
reactive responses to competitive processes. For 
example, some investors in energy services have 
developed a proprietary view on creating value by 
scaling up and consolidating national champions in 
the nascent energy services space, helping them 
emerge successful in highly competitive auction 
processes for scarce assets in the sector.

In addition, some funds are setting up separate 
funds with a different investment profile (typically, 
higher risk and smaller ticket size) to go after the 
energy transition opportunity in its early stages. The 
intention is eventually to migrate these assets to 
their infrastructure funds when they mature, or to 
sell them to other infrastructure funds.

There are, of course, opportunities outside 
of the energy transition. For example, several 
investors have recently bought large-scale 
telecommunications companies to get access to 
fiber and towers, and have proceeded to scale these 
acquisitions or integrations.

Employing roll-up and bolt-on strategies can be 
critical to scaling up smaller investments in segments 
in which larger companies simply do not exist. In some 
cases, investors may set up their own management 
teams and build businesses from scratch. For 
example, a consortium of pension funds established 
a platform for project investments in renewable-
generation assets. The platform now comprises 
more than 150 projects across the world with a total 
generating capacity of more than three gigawatts.

Building relationships with utilities to go after carve-
out opportunities can be a way to build scale quickly 
in many areas where credible at-scale investments 
are hard to find.

Strong evidence suggests that despite pressures 
from the flood of capital and the potential 
consequences of a widely feared recession, 
infrastructure remains an attractive long-term 
investment avenue for institutional investors.2 To stay 
in the race, investors will need to push the boundaries 
of investable assets, while also adhering to the 
investment objectives underlying infrastructure as an 
asset class—and of their limited partners.

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022US wealth management:  
A growth agenda for the 
coming decade 

Mounting hopes of postpandemic recovery signal an imperative to 
prepare for the changes in technology, consumer needs, and society 
that will shape the future of the wealth management ecosystem.

Wealth management is a growth industry, but it 
is experiencing a set of accelerating disruptions. 
While the pandemic challenged the performance 
of the US wealth management industry for much 
of 2020, the last 12 months have given rise to 
optimism that the conditions for a significant 
wave of innovation and experimentation across 
the wealth management ecosystem are in place. 
The conditions include rapid technological 
advancements, fast-evolving consumer needs and 
behaviors (accelerated by the pandemic), and an 
environment of economic stimulus.

To thrive in this dynamic environment, firms must 
prioritize growth, adopt an innovation mindset, 
and be prepared to reallocate resources rapidly in 
response to the changing context. Finally, to free 
resources for strategic investment and prepare for 
any potential market downturn, firms can rethink 
their cost structures and improve the industry’s 
spotty record on cost management.

To guide these efforts, this paper offers a brief 
overview of the US wealth management industry’s 
present conditions and then presents four themes 
that define the new growth narrative we foresee. 
We recommend agenda items for wealth managers 

to address as they plan how to flourish in the 
changing ecosystem. Finally, we offer questions for 
organizational self-assessment.

Coming out of the crisis: Resilient but 
not unscathed  
At face value, the US wealth management industry 
entered 2021 from a position of strength—record-
high client assets, record growth in the number 
of self-directed and advised clients, and healthy 
pretax margins (Exhibit 1). However, beneath these 
strong headline numbers, the story was mixed, with 
the worst two-year revenue growth since 2010, as 
well as negative operating leverage. The depressed 
margins and profit pools that resulted were caused 
primarily by rock-bottom interest rates and uneven 
cost discipline (Exhibit 2).

Consequently, while the industry is now benefiting 
from vigorous market performance, it faces 
significant crosscurrents: equity-market and 
interest-rate uncertainty and industry-specific 
challenges including lack of cost discipline, 
increased competition from new entrants, and an 
aging and shrinking advisor force.

Despite this near-term uncertainty, US wealth 
management remains a growth industry, albeit with 
moderating revenue growth projections. McKinsey 
modeling suggests industry revenue pools will 
grow by about 5 percent per year over the next five 
years,¹ driven by moderating market performance, 
moderate net flows, and the continued shift from 
brokerage to advisory (where revenue yields are 
typically higher). However, the growth will not be 
equally split among industry segments. We expect 
digital advice models, including robo- and hybrid 
advisory, to continue growing fastest, potentially 
even outperforming their historical revenue growth 
of more than 20 percent per year. Next in terms 
of growth will be registered investment advisors 
(roughly 10 percent projected annual growth rate), 
followed by national/regional broker–dealers  
(6 percent), direct brokerages (5 percent), 
wirehouses (2 percent), and other broker–dealers 
(independent, retail, and insurance owned) plus 

private banks (1 percent). If interest rates return 
to prepandemic levels, wirehouses and direct 
brokerages will disproportionately benefit, given 
their reliance on interest income from cash for 
profitability, with the overall growth rate for the 
industry reaching about 7 percent a year—similar to 
the growth that occurred between 2015 and 2018.

A growth agenda for the coming 
decade
Over the last 18 months, the industry has spurred a 
significant wave of innovation and experimentation. 
It is also facing long-standing demographic shifts 
that will redistribute wealth among subsegments. 
This combination of forces will shape growth trends 
for years to come. We see four key themes: fast-
growth segments, new client needs, new products, 
and new business models (Exhibit 3).

Fast-growth segments offer new potential
Three investor segments are showing signs of 
significant and lasting growth: women, engaged 
first-time investors, and a segment we call hybrid 
affluent investors.

Women are taking center stage as investors 
over the next decade. Today, women control a 
third of total US household investable assets—
approximately $12 trillion. Over the next decade, this 
share will grow. The biggest cause of this shift will 
be demographics: as baby boomer men die, many 
will cede control of assets to their female spouses, 
who tend to be both younger and longer lived. By 
2030, American women are expected to control 
much of the $30 trillion in investable assets that 
baby boomers will possess—a potential wealth 
transfer that approaches the annual GDP of the 
United States. At the same time, younger affluent 
women are becoming more financially savvy; for 

example, 30 percent more married women are 
making financial and investment decisions than five 
years ago.2

A new wave of engaged investors are opening 
accounts. The resurgence of the engaged-investor, 
or active-trader, segment has been one of the most 
headline-catching disruptions in the industry. Since 
the start of 2020, more than 25 million new direct 
brokerage accounts have been opened, a significant 
percentage by first-time investors. This growth 
resulted from a confluence of prepandemic market 
developments (for example, the elimination of online 
brokerage commissions, access to fractional share 
capabilities) and pandemic-related trends such as 
high savings rates (enabled by lower consumption). 

While this segment’s exponential growth is likely 
not sustainable (for example, there was a sharp 
decline in trading app downloads and active daily

wealth management,” McKinsey, July 29, 2020.

users in the third quarter of 2021), it remains 
poised for accelerated growth over the next 
decade, given engaged investors’ relatively low 
median age of 35.³ The opportunity for wealth 
managers is to serve this segment by meeting 
their demand for direct brokerage-based investing 
and to build deeper relationships with them over 
time—for example, by recognizing that these new 
investors tend to express their personal values in 
their investment decisions.

Hybrid affluent investors are an opportunity to 
differentiate. While headlines have focused on the 
rise of first-time young investors with typically low 
assets, growth in the hybrid investor segment—
those with at least one self-directed account and 
a traditional advisor—has been overlooked. In 
2021, a third of affluent investors—households with 
more than $250,000 and less than $2 million in 
investable assets—were hybrid (Exhibit 4), a sharp 
increase of nine percentage points in just three 
years. The biggest beneficiaries of this trend have 
been incumbent and new direct brokerages, as well 
as some traditional wealth managers with sizable 
direct brokerage platforms.

management of channel conflicts and potential 
revenue cannibalization.

New customer needs provide an opening to 
differentiate
Investors are increasingly looking for institutions that 
can provide them with omnichannel access, integration 
of banking and wealth management services, and 
personalized offerings. As similar kinds of benefits 
become available from providers of other services, 
investors see them more as needs than as luxuries. In 
fact, fully 50 percent of high-net-worth (HNW) and 
affluent clients say their primary wealth manager 
should improve digital capabilities across the board.

Omnichannel access is no longer just ‘nice to have.’ 
One of the clearest disruptions triggered by the 
pandemic has been the sharp acceleration of digital 
adoption across consumer segments—including 
wealthier and older clients who were previously less 
digitally inclined with respect to financial advice. As 
a result, according to McKinsey’s latest Affluent and 
High-Net-Worth Consumer Insights Survey, digital 
is now the most preferred channel for clients, closely 
followed by remote (Exhibit 5).

The rapid growth of hybrid affluent investors is a 
result of two trends that are expected to persist: 
investors’ desire for human advice and the ease 
and affordability of direct investing. Therefore, to 
foster deep relationships with affluent clients and 
prevent them from investing with competitors, 
wealth managers of all types need to have both 
direct brokerage and advisor-led offerings with a 
seamlessly integrated experience across the two. 
Achieving this will not be easy; it will require careful 

This trend is even more pronounced for the HNW 
segment, which we define as households with 
more than $2 million in investable assets: roughly 
40 percent of HNW clients say phone or video 
conferences are their preferred wealth management 
channels, and only 15 percent look forward to going 
back into branches or resuming in-person visits. 
Interestingly, the preference for digital and remote 
engagement among HNW clients is higher than for 
their affluent counterparts.

Convergence of banking and investing has gone 
mainstream. Over the last three years, there has 
been a striking increase in clients’ preference to 
consolidate their banking and wealth relationships 
to achieve convenience and better relationship 
deals: the share with this preference has risen from 
13 percent in 2018 to 22 percent in 2021. The trend 
applies to both wealthy and young households 
(Exhibit 6). In particular, 53 percent of those aged 
under 45 and about 30 percent of those with  
$5 million to $10 million in investable assets prefer 
to consolidate relationships.

Banks and wealth managers alike can benefit from 
this trend, but their starting position differs by client 

segment: HNW, ultra-HNW,⁴ and older clients tend to 
consolidate banking with their primary wealth manager, 
whereas young investors are more likely to consolidate 
wealth management with their primary bank.

Clients’ reasons for consolidating with their 
primary bank or investment firm vary. High-yield 
deposits, lower management fees, and seamless 
transactions across accounts are the top three 
reasons for consolidation—and are basically table 
stakes. Beyond that, our research has found 
that banks generally win on convenience (for 
example, an existing relationship with the client,  
customer service tailored to younger clients), while 
investment firms win on products and reputation

The increased preference for consolidating 
banking and investing has been driven by a flurry 
of innovation. National banks are building wealth 
management capabilities and closely integrating 
experiences with traditional banking services, often 

in partnership with fintechs. Full-service wealth 
managers are upgrading their digital banking 
capabilities. And consumer-facing fintechs—with 
millions of users—are blurring the lines between 
investing and cash management.

responded to the demand to personalize investment 
management with customized, tax-efficient 
managed accounts. Because of their operational 
complexity, these products have typically been 
accessible only to the HNW and ultra-HNW 
segments. However, direct indexing, fractional share 
trading, and $0 online commissions are shifting 
the paradigm by enabling customized portfolios of 
securities at lower minimums.

Assets under management (AUM) in direct 
indexing tripled between 2018 to 2020, reaching 
$215 billion, or 17 percent of the retail separately 
managed account (SMA) market. We anticipate 
direct indexing volumes to triple through 2025, 
given how this new investing technology meets 
client needs, most notably the growing demand 
for tax-efficient investing and the desire of some 
retail investors, particularly younger clients, to 
ensure that their portfolio holdings reflect their 
personal values (Exhibit 7). The recent flurry 
of acquisitions of direct indexing providers 

by leading US wealth and asset managers 
will create further supply-side momentum in 
expanding the growth of the category.

Broader adoption among clients will require further 
innovation. For both self-directed and advisor-led 
models, offering direct indexing requires a careful 
consideration of the trade-offs associated with 
taxes and environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) constraints. All this creates a need for intuitive 
interfaces and analytical tools, which need to be 
integrated into the advisor desktop and workflow.

New products expand ways to serve 
customers 
Across industries, transformation arises from 
the introduction of new products. In wealth 
management, we see notable potential in two main 
categories of new products: investments in private 
markets and investments in digital assets.

Democratization of private markets. In the current 
lower-for-even-longer interest-rate environment, 
investors’ appetite for alternative investments is 
as high as ever, with the young leading the way: 
about 35 percent of 25-to-44-year-old investors 
indicate an increased demand for alternatives. 
Within alternatives, private markets (private 
equity, private debt, real estate, infrastructure, 
and natural resources), an asset class that was 
once the preserve of institutional investors, is 
making inroads to individual portfolios. Large 
private-markets firms are building out retail 
distribution capabilities and vehicles, and home 
offices make it easier for clients to access private-
markets products, often with the help of fintech 
infrastructure providers. Increased client demand 
and innovations have potential to increase the 
share of assets allocated to private markets from 
about 2 percent in 2020 to 3 to 5 percent by 2025, 
representing asset growth of between $500 billion  
and $1.3 trillion. It is imperative for wealth 

managers to facilitate this growth by making it 
easier for their clients to access private markets.

Digital assets going mainstream. The arrival of 
an army of new retail investors has proven to be 
a boon to the growth of new asset classes that 
were incubated in the margins of the market. 
Nowhere is this phenomenon clearer than in the 
realm of digital assets, which have ballooned from 
a combined valuation of $100 billion in 2019 to 
a market capitalization of more than $2.5 trillion 
today. They span multiple digital asset classes, 
or “tokens,” beyond cryptocurrencies, including 
tokenized equities, bonds debt, stablecoins 
(typically pegged to conventional currencies), art, 
and collectibles. The motivations for investors 
in digital assets are diverse—experimentation, 
speculation, the search for inflation protection, 
or getting exposure to the building blocks of 
new technology that is increasingly cast as the 
next iteration of the internet (that is, Web3). 

US wealth management: A growth agenda for the coming decade

57

Whatever the motivation, investors’ enthusiastic 
embrace of digital assets is very clear. For example, 
digital trading platform Coinbase has gathered a 
staggering 68 million verified users.

For wealth managers, digital assets present both 
an opportunity and a challenge. On the one hand, 
the cryptocurrency market has grown too large 
to ignore amid robust client demand; 11 percent 
of affluent clients and 8 percent of HNW clients 
invest in digital assets. On the other hand, three 
broad challenges are associated with offering 
cryptocurrencies. First, regulatory ambiguity—on 
asset classification and tax reporting, among other 
issues—has lingered, often creating uncomfortable 
levels of risk exposure for wealth managers. While 
it is still early days, the advent of crypto exchange-
traded funds (ETFs) could help address some 
of these challenges. Second, the infrastructure 
required for offering digital assets, including 
custody services, differs from what is required for 
traditional investment products. Lastly, digital asset 
classes are not well understood by many advisors, 
so advising on the products is challenging for them.

Wealth managers face a choice: they can take a 
wait-and-see approach and accept the business 
risks associated with staying out of a rapidly 
growing market, or they can pursue the opportunity 
aggressively by leveraging partnerships with 
fintechs while addressing heightened regulatory 
risks. What remains for certain is that over the 
longer term, there is meaningful potential for a far 
broader class of digital assets to enter the investing 
mainstream and for the underlying technologies of 
blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi) to 
revolutionize the distribution of investment products, 
including the T+0 settlement cycle. 

Advisors’ desire for independence presents an 
opportunity to serve RIAs. The last decade has seen 
a migration of advisors to registered independent 
advisors, with 24 percent of all financial advisors 
being part of an RIA in 2020, compared with 16 
percent in 2010. This shift is expected to continue 
apace, with the share of advisors affiliated with 
RIAs growing to 26 percent by 2025. Motivations for 
advisors’ migration to RIAs include the expectation 
of higher payouts plus two other factors: First, 
advisors are looking at the RIA channel as the best 
way to monetize their business, with RIA acquisition 
multiples for top advisors (those with books over 
$1 billion) two to three times higher than retire-in-
place incentives at traditional wealth managers. 
Second, technology and services firms, working 
in conjunction with the major custodians, have 
lowered barriers for advisors to launch their own 
firms. Moreover, advisors believe they can procure 
technology and services that are similar to or better 
than what traditional wealth managers provide.

While this trend presents a challenge for wirehouses 
and broker–dealers, whose advisor force is 
expected to shrink by 3 percent over the next 
five years, there is a silver lining: RIAs’ reliance 
on third-party products and solutions creates 
an opportunity for participants in the wealth 
management ecosystem to seek a share of this fast-
growing revenue and profit pool. Some ecosystem 
participants are viewing this segment in terms of 
a single product or service—lead generation, tech 
point solutions, custodial offerings, banking-as-
a-service for advisors, asset management. Others, 
including turn key asset management providers 
(TAMPs), established custodians, and traditional 
wealth managers with attacker mindsets, are 
attempting to build a next-generation, wirehouse-
quality platform for advisors.

New business models position firms  
for growth
The last of our four contours of the new growth 
narrative is the introduction of new business models. 
Two such models are of importance: offering 
services to registered investment advisors (RIAs) 
and digitizing the delivery of advice.

Therefore, wealth managers, especially those who 
rely on advisor recruiting for growth, need to look 
beyond the competitive threat posed by the fast-
growing RIA channel and explore new business 
models that would allow them to participate in this 
growing revenue and profit pool. Wealth managers 
seeking to serve the RIA segment will need to 

58

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022manage technology as a core competency, and 
those with large advisor forces will need to manage 
the advisor attrition risks associated with opening 
up the platform (even partially) to RIAs.

offering. Bringing more investors on board will 
require matching the advisor-like experience with 
personalized content and solutions.

The opportunity for digital advice models. Digital 
advice models, including robo-advisor and hybrid 
advisor models, have been around for more than 
a decade and have been the fastest-growing 
wealth management delivery model, with more 
than 20 percent annual revenue growth between 
2015 and 2020. They still account for only about 1 
percent of the market, but the growth prospects 
are high: the last three years—and last 18 months 
in particular—have marked a step increase in 
investor comfort levels with these offerings 
(Exhibit 8). In fact, the share of investors saying 
they are comfortable with remote advice grew 
from about 38 percent in 2018 to roughly 46 
percent in 2021. Among clients younger than 45, 
the comfortable share grew from 43 percent to 
59 percent. Similarly, while comfort with digital-
only advice remains modest overall at about 15 
percent, it has more than doubled since 2018 
among investors under 45, to roughly half in 2021.

Unsurprisingly, the growing interest has motivated 
wealth managers to expand into and innovate 
in this channel. However, wealth managers 
should be aware that achieving a step change in 
adoption of digital advice offerings will require 
going beyond the lower-cost value proposition, 
privileged acquisition strategies, and brand equity. 
Among investors who do not express comfort 
with robo-advisor models, the main reasons they 
give are perceived lack of personalization, privacy 
concerns, and lack of motivation to explore the 

Embracing the new growth narrative: 
A four-part agenda
Clearly, wealth management remains an attractive 
industry with strong growth fundamentals and long-
term margins. If anything, the disruptions we have 
discussed in this report expand the industry’s options 
and will shape the growth narrative for the next decade.

Given the pace of change, stasis is not a viable 
option. We recommend that wealth managers 
follow a four-part agenda for action: reposition, 
redesign, reimagine, and reallocate.

Reposition the firm for what’s next
Every wealth manager needs to take a hard look at 
the secular growth themes shaping the industry—
fast-growth segments, banking, personalization, 
new product propositions, and new business 
models—and decide, based on the firm’s unique 
sources of competitive advantage, which of these 
updrafts it should ride. Where a firm lacks natural 
advantages in capitalizing on particular growth 
themes, M&A is a critical lever for accelerating the 
repositioning of individual wealth management 
franchises. The last 24 months have seen numerous 
high-profile transactions as firms seek scale and/
or the acquisition of new capabilities to accelerate 
their strategy. We expect M&A to be a particularly 
important theme over the next 24 months as 
wealth managers reposition themselves for the 
postpandemic “next normal,” whenever it arrives.

Redesign offerings for new needs
Firms also should monitor and try to anticipate 
evolving client needs, using this information to 
redesign their offerings. Examples could include 
new value propositions (for instance, around tax 
efficiency, integration of wealth and banking, or 
specific high-growth segments), privileged access 
to new products (such as digital assets or private 
markets), or completely new business models (for 
example, light-guidance digital offerings).

Reimagine client engagement and experience
The third agenda item is to radically reimagine 
client engagement and experience. The pandemic 
has reset clients’ assumptions about how they 
want to be served, and the accelerated uptake of 
technology has created unprecedented degrees 
of freedom for wealth managers. Every wealth 
manager needs to ask, “What is the blueprint for a 
client experience model in a digital-first world?” and 

“How can such a model simultaneously deepen our 
relationships and broaden our reach?”

Reallocate resources to support the strategy
Finally, successful wealth management firms 
make a bold commitment to putting the money 
where the strategy is, and they make multiyear 
resource-reallocation decisions, including where 
firm’s top talent spends time, in favor of growth. 
Regular reallocation of resources is a critical 
but often neglected step that can close the loop 
between visionary strategic intent and successful 
implementation.

Our research across industries suggests that 
fortune favors the bold: the top third of companies, 
which have been the most dynamic resource 
reallocators, achieved 1.6 times higher total returns 
to shareholders than the bottom third (about 10 
percent versus 6 percent annualized over 20 years). 

60

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 202260%

In the wealth management context, we estimate 
that top performers are making strategic resource 
reallocation decisions to the tune of 15 percent or 
more of operating expenses over five years, whereas 
those simply dabbling with subscale experiments in 
strategic growth areas will not see results. Simply put, 
firms should not aim to be all things to all clients.

Five questions for wealth management 
executives
Given the significance of the opportunity at hand, 
wealth management executives must consider their 
firm’s readiness to capitalize on it. To provoke a self-
assessment, we offer five questions for executives 
to ponder and discuss with their teams:

1.  What are the three or four priority growth 
themes you are betting on for the next 
five years? While several growth avenues 
and disruptions are reshaping the wealth 
management landscape, the optimal recipe will 
differ depending on an individual firm’s starting 
position and its sources of competitive advantage. 
Clarifying priority growth themes and aligning 
with your executive team help  lay a foundation for 
developing a winning growth strategy.

2.  Do you have the right team and operating 

model? To paraphrase Peter Drucker’s famous 
phrase, “Execution eats strategy for breakfast.” 
A prerequisite for successful execution is 
an effective leadership team that is brought 
together around critical behaviors. In the 
context of wealth management and the shifts 
the industry is going through, these behaviors 
for executive teams must include operating in 

increase in share of investors comfortable 
with digital-only models since 2018 and 
21% increase in those comfortable with 
remote models 

an agile manner and developing connections 
across business units and functions. In addition, 
the team needs leaders who are not afraid to 
experiment and innovate and whose mandates 
are aligned with major growth themes that 
typically cut across business unit lines (for 
example, banking and wealth, segments, 
sustainability).5 

3.  Does your ability to attract sought-after 

client-facing and technology talent match 
your ambition? Over the last 12 to 18 months, 
wealth managers of different sizes and business 
models have publicly announced ambitious 
hiring targets with an emphasis on client-facing 
and technology talent. However, these plans 
have been challenged by severe labor shortages 
across industries, as a result of what has been 
dubbed the Great Attrition: 40 percent of 
employees say they are at least somewhat likely 
to leave their current job in the next three to 
six months, and 54 percent of employees say 
they leave because they do not feel valued by 
their organizations.6 Wealth management is no 
exception to this trend. 

While many of the levers for attracting and 
retaining talent remain effective, other factors 
have gained importance during COVID-19, with 
more than 80 percent of workers saying that a 
hybrid-office working model is the optimal route 
forward. In addition to rethinking their operating 
models to attract and retain talent, wealth 
managers need to take bolder and more creative 
approaches to attracting new-to-industry talent. 
These may include flexible working arrangements, 
alternative career paths (including new payout

talent), and partnerships with various types of 
educational institutions. 

programmatic M&A in the context of business 
strategy is essential for making accretive deals 
that contribute to both top-line growth and 
business value.

4.  Are you reallocating a significant portion 

5.  Do you have a partnership strategy rooted 

of your resources—spending and capital—
toward priority growth areas, including M&A? 
Systematic and dynamic resource allocation 
is an essential part of a winning business 
strategy. Achieving industry-leading levels in 
this area involves several steps: conducting 
a critical review of the firm’s existing cost 
structure, introducing a culture that continuously 
reallocates resources from low- to high-value 
tasks, increasing transparency around returns 
of individual projects, and implementing 
governance processes to enable more dynamic 
resource allocation. 

Capital reallocation can be a powerful tool for 
acceleration of growth in high-priority areas, 
which requires a clear M&A blueprint consistent 
with the broader enterprise strategy. We expect 
three major M&A themes to shape wealth 
management deal making in the next 18 to 24 
months: (a) transactions focused on platform 
synergies, mostly in the vibrant RIA market 
but also among the largest wealth managers; 
(b) transactions focused on entering adjacent 
revenue pools, such as asset management, 
banking, retirement, or payments; and (c) 
transactions to acquire capabilities that will be 
key for growth—for example, direct indexing, tax 
solutions, or wealth tech. 

While not all deals are accretive in value, the top 
25 percent of deals achieve 8.5 percent excess 
TRS. Top acquirers are distinguished from the 
rest by two characteristics: the ability to embed 
M&A in their strategic planning process and 
a clear post-acquisition playbook, inclusive 
of an integration capability. Thinking through 

in your business strategy? When it comes to 
digital, data, and technology, it is impossible for 
any organization to stay ahead of the pack on 
every dimension, so a clear partnership strategy 
is crucial. In fact, many wealth management 
incumbents already rely on fintechs to gain 
access to better technology across the value 
chain—client acquisition, client front-end, 
portfolio management, point solutions on 
advisor desktops, cybersecurity, and cloud 
infrastructure, among others. Looking ahead, it 
is important for executives and their teams to 
be clear-eyed about which capabilities will be 
a source of sustainable competitive advantage 
and then to decide how to acquire those 
capabilities: build in-house, build in-house in 
partnerships with fintechs,  
or outsource.

Despite a modest dip in profits, the US wealth 
management industry has thus far come through 
the pandemic not only unscathed but with tailwinds 
from sustained demand for advice, potential upside 
of higher interest rates, the rise of new client 
segments, and the embrace of unprecedented 
levels and speed of innovation. As the industry 
moves toward the hoped-for postpandemic 
new normal, it faces near-term macroeconomic 
uncertainty but also meaningful opportunity. 

Tomorrow’s successful managers will need to 
adapt their models to preempt the disruptions that 
lie ahead and adopt a new sense of purpose and 
innovation as they head into a period of growth.

investing organization

AI and other digital technologies are ushering in the next horizon of performance 
differentiation. Here’s how to level up.

The broad-based adoption of digital technologies 
has emerged as one of the most powerful and 
disruptive forces in industry over the past decade, 
driving a fourth industrial revolution in which entire 
sectors are being reshaped and business processes 
transformed.

As often happens with changes of this magnitude, 
those slow to join the fold have been left at a 
competitive disadvantage. We’ve now seen once-
dominant incumbent organizations lose ground 
to their more digitized competitors in nearly every 
industry. In the asset-management space, there’s 
little doubt that institutional investors face the same 
peril. Banking offers a glimpse of what institutional 
investors might face as nimble new fintechs offering 
mobile alternatives to services such as payments, 
loans, and deposits chip away at incumbents. Other 
large asset managers, such as pension plans 
and general accounts for insurance, are likely to 
experience disruptions and performance impacts if 
they remain behind the digital curve.

The good news is that we’re still at the beginning 
stages of this new era for large investors. Those 
that embrace digital and analytics as necessary 
instruments to augment decision making will have 
an enormous advantage over those that continue 
to rely on personal judgment and incomplete data. 
Already, the adoption of digital technology at scale is 
creating a new breed of investors who are faster and 
better at identifying and evaluating opportunities. 

In this article, we’ll describe the nature of the 
opportunity for investors and explain how to get 
started—while avoiding common pitfalls. 

Digital and analytics: Practically made 
for investors 
Digital technologies profoundly alter how humans 
interact with each other, objects, machines, and 
systems and rewrite the division of labor between 
humans and machines. For investors, tasks 
performed from back to front offices can be 
streamlined by using digital applications. 

Artificial intelligence and other advanced analytics 
stand at the forefront of digital. Such technologies 

enable the analysis of massive amounts of data 
to generate predictive insights at a speed and 
scale well beyond what humans alone can achieve. 
Investors already are using analytics and various 
data sources, such as Bloomberg, to support their 
investment decision process, but many are only 
starting to leverage more advanced analytics 
powered by AI. The wide availability of ever-cheaper 
data and computing power means that AI can 
enable investors to analyze more data far faster than 
previously possible. 

AI-enabled automation can also help investors 
perform repetitive tasks faster and at lower cost. 
Many investment processes are repeatable. Tedious, 
redundant analyses, for example, can now be 
carried out by computers, allowing humans to focus 
on what they do best: evaluating those machine-
generated insights to challenge their investment 
theses and factor in idiosyncratic risks that AI will 
not capture. 

The cost advantages of digital technologies increase 
the more they are used. Once the investment in 
technology has been made, organizations can 
expand the technology’s use with zero marginal 
increase in costs. Developing the ability to generate 
fresh investment insights with greater efficiency will 
prove critical for investors to remain relevant and 
competitive in the years ahead. 

Early returns from the field
While it’s still early days, there is ample evidence 
that digital and analytics can provide investors with 
a competitive advantage. Early adopters are using 
analytics to support portfolio managers across 
multiple asset classes. Some firms are using AI to 
analyze hundreds of nonconventional data sources 
to help them derive a basket of stocks with a higher 
likelihood of outperformance. A study by McKinsey 
of more than 1,000 investors found that those 
leveraging analytics had a 5.3 percent gain in return 
on investment capital (ROIC) over those that relied 
on a more traditional approach. 

In addition, there’s evidence from adjacent 
sectors. Man Group, a UK-based hedge fund 
with $154 billion in assets under management, is 

64

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022 
 
at the forefront of using AI to generate returns. It 
is continuing to push the frontiers through the 
Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance (OMI), 
a research institute it co-founded with Oxford 
University in 2007. The OMI brings together experts 
from academia and industry in a wide variety of 
disciplines. They use AI, machine learning, and other 
technologies to generate insights into markets and 
develop new tools for financial decision making. In 
real estate, using AI to forecast rent at the street-
corner level has led to stronger performance in 
data-rich markets such as the United States. During 
the COVID-19 crisis, even port-traffic recovery 
emerged as an area where AI was better suited to 
look at all available data to predict where and when 
traffic would resume. 

Despite these successes, some investors shun new 
technologies because they are wed to the belief 
that making investment decisions or enhancing the 
value of a private equity investment is more art than 
science. Still others may fear the threat that AI poses 
to their jobs and compensation.  

The reality is more nuanced. Successful use of 
digital and AI requires a clear understanding of the 
limits and strengths of the technologies—as well 
as the limits and strengths of the humans who must 
wield them. Both have essential roles. 

Getting started—while avoiding 
common pitfalls
Realizing the full potential of digital and analytics 
requires a radical change to culture and mindset. 
Organizations must shift from a culture that thinks 
in terms of individual use cases and achieving 
immediate returns on technology investments to a 
culture in which entire investment and operational 
processes (such as hiring, performance evaluation, 
and general-partner-agreement compliance) are 
reengineered to fully leverage technology. 

To reshape the organizational culture as well as the 
actual technology required for full-scale adoption of 
digital technologies, successful companies focus on 
strategy, capabilities, and execution (exhibit). There 
are pitfalls in each of these areas, and we call them 
out here so investment institutions can avoid them.

Strategy
While it’s important to be strategic rather 
than tactical, that doesn’t mean every part 
of the organization should be transformed 
immediately. To ensure impact is created early 
in the transformation, it is best to start with the 
transformation of a single business domain before 
moving to another part of the organization—a 
full portfolio such as value investing or corporate 
bonds, for example—where investing teams are 
already open to reconsidering their approach 
in order to deliver stronger performance. 
Although functions such as partner-relationship 
management, human resources, risk, or finance are 
also great candidates, demonstrating investment 
impact is more likely to galvanize the organization, 
build belief in the benefits of digitization, and create 
the excess returns required to fund future efforts.

Strategic pitfalls to avoid
Assuming leadership knows how to direct 
digitization efforts. Make sure decision makers 
get the training and background they need to 
lead the digitization effort effectively. Leaders 
with only limited technology literacy can have 
misconceptions about the power and potential of 
AI and other digital technologies, which can cause 
organizations to work on the wrong problems 
or adopt solutions that are already outdated. 
Executives must recognize that the risks of 
disrupting their internal investment processes 
with digitization are far lower than the risks of 
not adopting technology at all and losing their 
competitive advantage in the long run.

Setting the wrong goal. Many organizations 
misunderstand the real value of digital 
technologies and set about using it to replace 
humans rather than to enhance human decision 
making. On the other hand, sophisticated investors 
have seen their portfolio performance in equities 
improve by more than 50 basis points by allowing 
AI to identify a basket of stocks where portfolio 
managers should focus their attention. The 
right goal is most often to pursue digital and AI 
technologies as a means of human augmentation 
rather than replacement.

Tracking impact can be more complicated because tech solutions cut across the enterprise

Getting too narrow. Some investors focus on 
addressing smaller, individual issues with software 
that isn’t well-integrated into the overall investing 
process. As a result, they often end up launching 
dozens of small initiatives that, taken together, do 
not materially move the needle for the organization. 
Investment decision makers need to take a  
holistic, strategic view of the opportunities new 
technologies present.

Capabilities
To enable a long-term technology transformation, 
firms will need to set up the right internal capabilities 
(see sidebar, “Bringing leadership and practitioners 
into the process”). Scoring some early wins can 
inject momentum into the overall transformation, so 
these early efforts must be well supported. They 
should also fit into an overall strategic foundation 
that can ultimately support scaling of digital and 
analytics throughout the organization. Some of 
these capabilities include the following:

66

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022Sophisticated investors have seen  
their portfolio performance in equities  
improve by more than 50 basis points 
by allowing AI to identify a basket 
of stocks where portfolio managers 
should focus their attention.

 — Technology: Technology tops the list of key 

capabilities. For at-scale digital deployment, 
technology should ideally be cloud based to 
enable agility and foster innovation. Firms also 
need tooling that can enable continuous solution 
delivery and post-deployment monitoring (such 
as MLOps). 

 — Data: The approach to data is also critical. Firms 
need a vision and strategy that provide visibility 
on the full life cycle of data, from acquisition to 
insight consumption, and a data architecture and 
data governance that are supported by IT. 

 — Talent: The new talent model is much more tech 
heavy, with teams of highly technical specialists 
guided by a few seasoned investors who have 
the judgment and experience to make the best 
use of the machine-generated insights. This 
requires new processes to recruit from a wider 
array of backgrounds. The revised HR strategy 
must adapt compensation and incentives for 
the differing needs and aspirations of tech 
candidates. For instance, as a systematic asset 
manager, Man Group invested in a broad range 
of talent from different scientific backgrounds. 
These recruits are fully integrated into 

Bringing leadership and practitioners into the process

Success with digital and analytics will ultimately depend on whether leadership and practitioners buy into the new solutions 
and ways of working. Both groups should be part of the process—and receive specialized training as the first pilot ramps up. 

Leaders: The executive team needs a common understanding of digital technology and its related terms. Training should also 
focus on helping leaders champion agile development projects, finding the optimal balance between guidance and autonomy 
to allow innovative yet practical ideas to flourish.

Core practitioners: For speed and efficiency, multiple core-practitioner cohorts (data scientists, data engineers, translators, 
product owners) should be trained in parallel so the organization has the resources to move to new opportunities over time. 
Delivering these trainings in mixed cohorts and regrouping the various roles to address real business problems will help the 
organization expand its pipeline of projects while building the necessary bench to accomplish the digitization journey. 

The broader organization: From the start of the digitization journey, the central team—that is, the group responsible for driving 
the AI agenda and setting up the core analytical practices—should roll out an organization-wide digital-literacy program to help 
employees at all levels understand the rationale behind the effort and enable them to interact effectively with the central team 
to identify goals and end products.

distinction between technical (for example, data

the best opportunities and co-developing 
solutions and adoption processes with the 
investment professionals.

 — Agile: Finally, to rapidly develop, test, and 

iteratively improve tech solutions, firms will need 
a new operating model that encourages deep 
customer input and collaboration with all key 
business functions. This means empowering 
delivery teams with quick decision making, 
adaptive learning, and greater autonomy. 

Capability-building pitfall to avoid
Shiny-object syndrome. In some cases, investors 
get caught up in pursuing technology for its own 
sake, rather than leveraging a practical approach 
that is fit for purpose. Successful companies keep 
their eyes on the prize. Democratizing access to 
data, building interfaces for ease of consumption, 
embedding analytics, or using automation to focus 
high-performing resources on the tasks that add 
the most value will serve companies far better than 
building out the latest tech without a clear, practical 
application. Many investors overinvest in developing 
sophisticated AI models, for example, rather than 
weaving AI into the fabric of their organization by 
making code available and easy to use, driving 
adoption, and putting in place the capabilities, 
infrastructure, and data foundation needed to scale. 

Execution
Adapting the organizational model to maximize 
adoption of technology by end users in the 
organization may be the most challenging part of a 
digital transformation, often representing half of the 
total effort and investment. 

Doing so successfully involves three steps:

 — Establish a robust protocol for rolling out 

analytics solutions to the front line by identifying 

 — Define a framework for ongoing monitoring of 
analytics solutions to enable improvement as 
issues arise.

 — Align key stakeholders to ensure accountability 

for reinforcing adoption and ownership of new 
processes lies with the business, not IT.

Execution pitfall to avoid
Leaving end users on the sidelines. The practice of 
putting frontline users at the center of technology 
delivery helps organizations seamlessly integrate 
insights from data and analytics into the investment 
process. For example, BlackRock’s Systematic 
Active Equity team uses human insights, data, 
technology, and mathematics to drive adoption of 
digital and analytics tools across the core business 
processes and achieve better results for customers.

Industries are being fundamentally disrupted 
by digitization, and the investment space is no 
exception. However, basic digital technologies 
will eventually erode the scale advantage for 
investors, making speed the primary differentiator 
between competitors—speed that AI can help 
provide. There will likely be a dispersion of returns 
that favors players with AI-augmented workforces 
at the expense of those that continue to invest 
with less sophisticated tools. We believe a window 
of opportunity exists for investors to build both 
the foundational and advanced technological 
capabilities they need to be on the winning side. 
Now is the time to act.

Tackling inflation with active 
price management  

by Niels Adler and Nicolas Magnette

Rising inflation is prompting industrial players to pay greater attention to their pricing, cost, and 
sales management practices. According to McKinsey’s analysis of 55 European B2B companies in 
the industrial sector, active price management techniques have boosted revenues and profitability 
over the past year. Among the top-quartile companies that improved their profitability and revenue 
the most during this period, more than 50 percent said they used active pricing management 
techniques while discussing quarterly results, including the use of determined language, such 
as “taking bold pricing action.” For a successful pricing strategy, players should build their plans 
across the short-, medium- and long-term.

Space investment is 
diversifying to new orbits  
and technologies

by Ryan Brukardt, Jesse Klempner, and Brooke Stokes

Private investors are diversifying their exposure to space-related companies. Historically, a 
large portion of both private and government funding has gone toward satellites in medium-
Earth orbit (MEO) or geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) (which operates at a higher 
altitude) for purposes including GPS and TV coverage. Investors then expanded their focus to 
ventures in low-earth orbit (LEO). Today, there is growing interest in space ventures focused on 
orbits around the moon and those even farther from the Earth, with about $1 billion in private 
investment going toward these initiatives in 2021. These ventures have varied areas of focus, 
from spacecraft components and technologies to mining, infrastructure, and robotics.

Global food supply faced  
converging risks in 2022; next  
year could be even harder

by Daniel Aminetzah, Artem Baroyan, Nicolas Denis, Sarah Dewilde, Nelson Ferreira, Oleksandr 
Kravchenko, Julien Revellat, and Ivan Verlan

The global food system depends on a carefully calibrated system in which six main growing regions 
supply the majority of the world’s exported grain. The war in Ukraine— combined with early climate 
change impacts, trade restrictions, fertilizer shortages, higher energy prices, and other factors—
has thrown the system into a state of high risk. In 2022, much of the deficit in exported grain was 
caused by logistical problems that trapped grain in Black Sea ports. Next year, there could be even 
greater deficits because grain has not been planted in parts of Ukraine, and suboptimal conditions 
may further decrease harvests in this key breadbasket region. Stakeholders should consider ways 
to create a more resilient method to feed the world, including by reducing waste and accelerating 
efficiency in the food system.

Unlocking the growth 
opportunity in battery 
manufacturing equipment

by Jakob Fleischmann, Dorothee Herring, Ruth Heuss, Friederike Liebach, and Martin Linder

Europe’s battery cell–machinery equipment industry is booming on the back of rising global 
demand for electric vehicles. By 2025, the annual business opportunity for the industry 
is estimated to reach €5 billion to €7 billion. To meet this demand, roughly 30 new battery 
manufacturing facilities would need to come online across Europe, requiring up to €100 billion in 
capital expenditures. Securing equipment supply and avoiding production delays, however, will be 
key success factors in ensuring businesses can make the most of this unprecedented opportunity.

Is your capital strategy ready 
for the 21st century’s first big 
investment wave?

by Steffen Fuchs, Homayoun Hatami, Tip Huizenga, and Christoph Schmitz

The magnitude is unprecedented: between 2022 and 2050, roughly $9.2 trillion in annual 
average spending will be required to renew, upgrade, and build physical assets to meet the 
world’s decarbonization and sustainability goals. In a net-zero 2050 scenario, mobility, power, 
and buildings require the most capital spending. Successful implementation of such a colossal 
capital management strategy will be challenging. Organizations will need to address supply 
chain inefficiencies; outdated project delivery systems; and shortages of labor, equipment, 
and raw materials. The solution partly lies in adopting a CEO-led approach that focuses on 
deploying advanced analytics for better capital planning.

Spending on physical assets for energy and land-use systems in the NGFS Net Zero 
2050 scenario would rise by about $3.5 trillion annually more than today.

¹We have sized the total spending on physical assets in power, mobility, fossil fuels, biofuels, hydrogen, heat, CCS (not including storage), buildings, industry (steel 

and cement), agriculture, and forestry. Estimation includes spend for physical assets across various forms of energy supply (eg, power systems, hydrogen, and biofuel 
supply), energy demand (eg, for vehicles, alternate methods of steel and cement production), and various forms of land use (eg, GHG-efficient farming practices).
²Based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2). Based on analysis of systems that account for ~85% of overall CO₂ emissions 

today. Spend estimates are higher than others in the literature because we have included spend on high-carbon technologies, agriculture, and other land use, and 
taken a more expansive view of the spending required in end-use sectors. 

³Our analysis divides high-emissions assets from low-emissions assets. High-emissions assets include assets for fossil fuel extraction and refining, as well as fossil 

fuel power production assets without CCS; fossil fuel heat production, gray-hydrogen production; steel BOF; cement fossil fuel kilns; ICE vehicles; fossil fuel 
heating and cooking equipment; dairy, monogastric, and ruminant meat production. Low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure include assets for 
blue-hydrogen production with CCS; green-hydrogen production using electricity and biomass; biofuel production; generation of wind, solar, hydro-, geothermal, 
biomass, gas with CCS, and nuclear power along with transmission and distribution and storage infrastructure; heat production from low-emissions sources such 
as biomass; steel furnaces using EAF, DRI with hydrogen, basic oxygen furnaces with CCS; cement kilns with biomass or fossil fuel kilns with CCS; low-emissions 
vehicles and supporting infrastructure; heating equipment for buildings run on electricity or biomass, including heat pumps; district heating connections; cooking 
technology not based on fossil fuels; building insulation; GHG-efficient farming practices; food crops, poultry and egg production; and land restoration.

Cracking the growth code  
in chemicals 

by Siddhant Gupta and Ryan Paulowsky

Chemical companies need to rethink strategy. Despite high demand from emerging markets, 
many diversified and specialty manufacturers are not achieving outsize returns or consistent 
revenue growth. Only 16 percent of chemical companies—the growth champions—managed to 
grow above global GDP growth rates while delivering an ROIC [return on invested capital] higher 
than the chemical industry’s weighted average cost of capital. Slowing market momentum post-
COVID-19 risks tempering growth more. Chemical companies need to ramp up their omnichannel 
strategies, invest in digital and analytic capabilities, and reevaluate their contracting strategies to 
provide better protection against inflationary pressures.

Three pathways to fast  
and profitable growth in  
the consumer sector

by Jordan Bar Am, Simon Land, Duncan Miller, René Schmutzler, and Gage Wells 

Achieving continuous, profitable growth in the consumer sector amid continuing inflation and 
supply chain challenges is not easy. Size matters. Between 2009 and 2019, smaller companies 
(with $300 million to $3 billion in annual revenue) grew fastest. On the other hand, companies 
with more than $10 billion in annual revenue faced greater challenges and grew at only  
2.4 percent. Companies that have outperformed, both in terms of rapid growth and expanded 
margins, typically benefited from the following strategies: expanding the company’s core, 
entering into new categories and geographies, and launching disruptive businesses.

The building products industry 
is ripe for innovation 

by Matt Bereman, Jose Luis Blanco, Brendan Fitzgerald, Imke Mattik, and Erik Sjödin

The building products industry has been fraught with supply chain disruptions, labor 
shortages, and raw-materials price volatility. Our 2022 global survey of more than 500 
industry players revealed that many executives view investing in innovation, digital 
transformation, and R&D as key differentiators. But change is hard—and harder for some than 
others. To stimulate growth and avoid getting left behind due to these trends, leaders should 
focus on key value creation drivers. These include setting clear targets for innovative growth, 
doing routine interventions on cost programs, implementing marketing and sales initiatives, 
and developing a more agile approach to resource allocation.

Profit pools are shifting in  
the US healthcare industry 

by Shubham Singhal and Neha Patel

While the growth outlook for the US healthcare industry remains positive, certain segments 
are poised to outperform between now and 2025. The overall industry is expected to grow 
at 6 percent per year during this period, with payers and providers growing the fastest. For 
the payer segment, the profit pool is likely to shift toward government segments due to rapid 
growth in the 65-and-up population and increased adoption of Medicare Advantage. Positive 
outlook for providers is also driven by the aging population, in addition to the pandemic-
triggered shift in care delivery services and nonacute sites of care.

What are the biotech 
investment themes that will 
shape the industry?

by Olivier Leclerc, Michelle Suhendra, and Lydia The

Until last year, venture capital (VC) companies were investing substantially in biotech start-ups using 
innovative platform technologies to address patients’ unmet needs. This industry segment received 
more than two-thirds of the total $52 billion VC biotech funding from 2019 to 2021. Investor interest 
also surged in cell therapy 2.0, next-generation cell therapies, precision medicine, and other biotech 
platforms. This increased capital allocation has the potential to positively shape long-term drug 
development if biotech companies are able to successfully weather ongoing macro challenges, 
including slower economic growth, higher inflation, and rising interest rates.

Accelerating the energy  
transition requires more  
capital allocation

by Tamara Gruenewald, Jesse Noffsinger, Ole Rolser, Namit Sharma, Bram Smeets, Linda 
Tiemersma, Christer Tryggestad, Jasper van de Staaij, and Markus Wilthaner

The war in Ukraine has sent energy markets haywire. Amid all the volatility, some long-term 
trends—particularly the push for decarbonization—continue to develop. As countries transition 
to a low-carbon economy, substantial investments will be needed to support their emission-
reduction goals. According to our Global Energy Perspectives 2022 report, across sectors, 
annual investment in energy supply and production is expected to double by 2035 to reach $1.5 
trillion to $1.6 trillion. Decarbonization technologies are projected to make up more than a fourth 
of these total global investments. Despite their growth potential, however, the business models 
and revenue streams in a decarbonized system continue to remain uncertain.

Playing offense on circularity 
can net European consumer 
goods companies €500 billion

by Sebastian Gatzer, Stefan Helmcke, and Daniel Roos

The European consumer goods industry is witnessing rapid growth in the demand for circular 
products, led by sustainability-conscious shoppers and regulation. Beyond the obvious 
environmental benefits, there is also a strong business case for companies—particularly in 
the fast-moving consumer goods, fashion and luxury, and electronics segments—to promote 
recycled, refurbished, and reused goods. To capitalize on this value creation potential, companies 
can develop greener supply chains and operations, calibrate portfolios toward high-demand 
circular products, and command appropriate green premiums.

By 2030, European circular-economy product segments will grow at around 10 to 
15 percent annually to reach around €400 billion to €650 billion.

Startup funding in logistics 
is the next big investment 
opportunity 

by Ludwig Hausmann, Maite Pena-Alcaraz, Jaron Stoffels, Max Wiest, and Tobias Wölfel

Investors are exploring new and relatively untapped growth areas within the highly sought-
after logistics industry. Funding for logistics start-ups almost doubled in 2021, with last-mile 
delivery businesses, visibility and intelligence providers, and road-freight marketplaces 
receiving the largest share of inflows. These areas of the logistics value chain gained global 
attention amid the disruption triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. While only a few startups 
have scaled up and achieved profitability so far, more are likely to grow into mature disruptors 
over time. For incumbents to stay competitive, digitization will be key.

sees life and annuities 
as an enticing form of 
permanent capital

Private acquisitions of in-force books are growing. Here’s a  
playbook for those considering market entry, those already in,  
and insurers wondering how to respond.

Permanent capital—investment funds that do not 
have to be returned to investors on a timetable, or at 
all—is, according to some, the “holy grail” of private 
investing.1 Permanent capital owes its exalted status 
to the time and effort that managers can save on 
fundraising, and the flexibility it provides to invest at 
times, like a crisis, when other forms of capital can 
become scarce.

represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity. 
We’ll also look at the requirements for PE firms on 
the sidelines that want to enter the market, discuss 
some overlooked ways that PE owners can create 
value, and highlight some implications for life 
insurers as they consider either selling a portion of 
their book of business or emulating and competing 
with this potent new industry force.

Permanent capital can take many forms, including 
long-dated and open-ended fund vehicles. The 
balance sheet of a life and annuities company is 
one form of permanent capital that has drawn much 
attention. In 2021, private investors announced 
deals to acquire or reinsure more than $200 billion 
of liabilities in the United States. Such investors now 
own over $900 billion of life and annuity assets in 
Western Europe and North America. Assuming the 
pending deals close successfully, private investors 
will own 12 percent of life and annuity assets in the 
United States, totaling $620 billion, and represent 
more than a third of US net written premiums of 
indexed annuities. All five of the largest private 
equity (PE) firms by assets have holdings in life 
insurance, representing 15 to 50 percent of their 
total assets under management. By our count, 15 
alternative asset managers have entered the market, 
or stated their intent to do so. Insurance carriers are 
also benefiting from all the attention: many of the 
largest insurers have sold legacy books to private 
buyers, typically to improve their return on equity 
and to free up capital for reinvestment or return 
to shareholders. For some public carriers, these 
transactions have generated near-instantaneous 
expansion of their price–earnings multiple.

The trend is not new: private investing in insurance 
dates back more than 50 years to Berkshire 
Hathaway’s acquisition of National Indemnity 
in 1967. As that example shows, many forms of 
insurance beyond life and annuities can serve 
as permanent capital, including specialty and 
property and casualty (P&C). In this article, however, 
we’ll focus on the reasons why many PE firms 
have concluded that life insurance and annuities 

Why PE investments in life insurance 
are growing
The core attraction is straightforward. The balance 
sheets of life and annuities companies are well 
stocked with assets (to match the liabilities of future 
payouts and indemnities), but until payout, these 
assets need to be invested to generate returns. And 
in many cases, the cost of servicing the liabilities 
is significantly lower than the potential investment 
return. The spread represents an attractive margin.

The most common way for general partners (GPs)  
to capture the spread is to set up an insurer that  
they control through an equity investment 
(sometimes in conjunction with other investors,  
such as sovereign-wealth funds) and then acquire  
or reinsure books from other insurers. To ensure 
they earn the required returns on acquired books, 
these GPs typically influence the strategic asset 
allocation (SAA) and apply their investment 
management capabilities to earn alpha on some of 
the asset classes. The benefits to the GP in this case 
are threefold:

 — First, in our experience, executing the value-

creation playbook can generate internal rates 
of return (IRRs) of 10 to 14 percent. Investment 
returns have substantially lifted return on equity 
(ROE) in recent years. GPs achieve stronger 
investment returns largely by rotating the asset 
allocation into classes that are higher risk and 
higher return (while still meeting regulatory and 
rating agency guidelines) and achieving higher 
alpha within these asset classes. Consider what 
US PE-backed insurers have accomplished: 

1  Stephen Foley and Henny Sender, “Permanent capital: Perpetual cash machines,” Financial Times, January 4, 2015.

86

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022one analysis found that they generated 62 
basis points (bps) higher investment yield than 
the industry average.2 Within three years of 
acquisition, 80 percent of these insurers had 
increased their allocation to asset-backed 
securities (primarily collateralized loan 
obligations), and over half of their investments 
were in private loans (compared with 37 percent 
for the industry). Many PE firms have privileged, 
at-scale capabilities to originate higher risk-
return assets and deliver excess returns. What’s 
more, the approximately ten times asset-to-
equity ratio typical of insurers amplifies the 
impact of strong investment performance.

A few other factors also contribute to healthy 
IRRs. For one, disciplined owners are often able 
to operate the business more efficiently and 
effectively, as we discuss below. In addition, 
for some books like variable annuities, public 
valuations appear to be lower than private 
valuations. As such, public investors may be wary 
of the volatility and opaque risk profile, raising 
the issue of whether such books are better 
suited to private ownership.

 — Second, investing these assets provides a stable 
base for GPs to rapidly build their alternative 
credit capabilities. Credit investing is a strategic 
growth area for many firms at a time when 
PE markets are becoming more competitive. 
Acquiring a life book immediately provides 
long-term assets for the firm’s credit arm to 
invest. It’s a much faster way to reach scale and 
significantly less onerous than raising several 
credit funds. Depending on the structure of the 
vehicle, this can provide a significant source of 
fee-related earnings, which are more resilient to 
market fluctuations and more stable than carried 
interest. In particular, PE-backed insurers 
typically use structured credit products as core 
assets in their life insurance books. Origination 
of these asset classes is reaching record levels. 
For example, collateralized loan obligations, a 
core asset class for PE-backed insurers, are now 
a $760 billion market.

 — Finally, life insurance offers the potential for 
scale. Traditional life liabilities in Europe total 
€4.5 trillion; in the United States, life and annuity 
insurers carry $4.5 trillion of assets on the 
general account, with an additional $1.5 trillion 
in separate variable-annuity liabilities, and there 
are $3 trillion of private-sector defined-benefit 
liabilities. Even after many large PE acquisitions, 
a huge supply continues to be available, allowing 
PE firms that build insurance capabilities to 
scale and take full advantage of this opportunity.

Another model that some GPs follow is a partnership 
or outsourced chief-investment-officer (OCIO) 
model, in which they work with incumbent insurers 
to manage a portion of their assets for the long term 
and take only a limited equity stake, or none at all. 
In this case they still receive the benefits of scaling 
their credit capabilities, as a high-performing 
OCIO operation can attract other insurers looking 
to outsource investment management. This also 
provides a steady source of fee-related earnings, 
which can drive higher valuations for the GP. And 
as a strategy, this too has potential to be scaled, as 
other insurers seek higher allocations to these high-
yielding asset classes.

Sellers are willing
Put it all together, and it’s clear why life insurance 
is attractive to PE buyers. Further fueling the 
market is insurers’ willingness to sell: some see 
an opportunity to shift strategy and move into 
more attractive businesses; others think they 
can deliver greater value by exiting these books 
and returning the capital to shareholders. One 
example of the strategic shift is the move by many 
insurers to a capital-light, fee-based business 
model (such as investment management and 
recordkeeping) in structurally advantaged value 
pools in their domestic markets (for example, in 
defined-contribution pensions in which assets are 
growing at 6 to 8 percent annually across Europe 
and the United States). Similar to GPs with strong 
fee income in their revenue mix, insurers with a high 
proportion of fee earnings will typically trade at 
higher valuations (often nine to 12 times P/E ratio,

or 1.1 to 1.7 times book value) than those in capital-
intensive businesses (usually five to eight times, or 
less than 1.1 times book value). Selling a life back 
book can provide the needed capital to pivot quickly 
into a new business, and investors are supportive 
of such moves. For example, one broad-based US 
player divested its closed block of variable annuities 
to reduce the volatility of earnings and refocus on 
capital-light businesses. Investors responded well: 
over the subsequent three years TSR outperformed 
the life index by ten percentage points. The carrier’s 
price-to-book (PB) ratio rose from 1.2 to 1.6 times, at 
a time when the broader industry’s PB ratio fell from 
1.3 to 1.0 times.

Even as the capital-light model has gained favor, 
the traditional business has become less attractive. 
Many insurers’ earnings on in-force blocks have 
come under pressure, as guarantee rates to 
policyholders are still as high as 150 to 400 bps in 
some markets, while yields on bonds have declined 
by 150 to 300 bps since 2010–11. Naturally, this has 
strained capital as insurers have had to adjust their 
reserves to reflect future earnings expectations. 
An average insurer reinvests about 12 percent of 
its assets annually, so this profitability challenge 
becomes increasingly acute every year. PE buyers 
are subject to the same pressures, of course, but 
with their different approaches to investment and 
operations, they are better able to overcome the 
costs of the capital requirements.

In addition, operational and IT issues have continued 
to challenge profitability and require significant 
investment and management attention to address. 
For example, migrating legacy policy-administration 
systems and investing in automation can be 
attractive in the medium term but require careful 
management to prevent technical or servicing issues.

In short, opportunity abounds. But how to take 
advantage? The playbook varies for PE firms 
considering an acquisition, those that have owned a 
life book for some time, and insurers.

Market entrants: How to begin
As so many PE firms have acquired insurance 
assets, would-be entrants and firms looking to scale 
their nascent operation may find the market more 
complicated than it once was.

As always, the approach starts with strategy. PE 
firms must first get clear on their strategy for 
insurance investments, choosing from a spectrum 
that ranges from a one-off opportunistic play to 
be sold in several years to the foundation for a 
future platform—and a source of permanent capital. 
The choice of strategy has material implications 
down the line, on whether or not to insource 
IT and operational capabilities; talent strategy; 
target geographies (where market dynamics and 
regulatory factors are also important); and target 
books of business (in annuities, life, or pension risk 
transfer). Defining the approach up front will save 
costs later. Further, if the deal is large and part of a 
platform strategy, the investment could change the 
DNA of the firm, shifting the focus from PE to private 
credit, while also posing future regulatory hurdles.

Those firms that are thinking of a platform play, and 
a long-lasting and growing source of permanent 
capital, will need three capabilities: proprietary 
access to potential deals, value-creation skills to 
make the most of the deals they close, and strong 
risk-management capabilities given the nature  
of insurance.

The most common path for new entrants is to 
acquire or reinsure a closed block. As competition 
increases, some GPs are exploring alternatives, 
such as scaling organically or through a series of 
smaller transactions. However, these approaches 
are proving challenging given the need to reach 
scale to attain attractive economics. A third 
approach seen in two recent examples is a 
partnership model. New entrants could consider 
partnering with insurers in addition to making 
outright acquisitions. If the two parties share in the 
upside (and the risks) and share the capabilities (for 

88

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022example, the insurer brings some of the technical 
capabilities while the GP supplies investment skills), 
PE firms might be able to secure the benefits of 
permanent capital while avoiding the complexity of 
operating a life insurer.

There are a few risks that PE firms should be aware 
of and take action to mitigate, starting with the 
asset side of the balance sheet, including illiquidity 
and credit risk. Rotating the portfolio into higher-
risk credit assets has advantages but also creates 
risk that is important to manage, particularly as 
the portfolio has typically been invested in more 
liquid, stable assets. Managing the credit risk of the 
underlying assets, maintaining sufficient liquidity as 
needed for policyholders, and managing the mark-
to-market volatility on the credit portfolio during a 
credit downturn to maintain regulatory and rating 
stability are all critical. This risk has been latent, 
given the relatively benign credit environment in 
the past decade, but a future emergence could put 
stress on balance sheets.

A second concern is regulatory uncertainty. 
Although regulators are getting used to the idea 
of PE ownership of life carriers,3 approval can take 
time. As PE firms enter a highly regulated industry 
for the first time (and encounter all the risks of 
shifting regulation), they will need skills to engage 
well with the regulator (and ratings agencies, critical 
stakeholders in reinsurance), to build their trust, 
and, ultimately, to persuade them that the firm is a 
responsible owner.

Public opinion can be another obstacle. In two 
recent Western European deals, concerns about 
the impact of a PE owner meant that late-stage 
negotiations did not succeed.4 Finally, firms should 
consider limited partners’ (LPs) reactions to a 
life acquisition. The potential for sponsor-owned 
insurers to invest in other assets and funds raised by 
the same sponsor may change the GP/LP dynamic. 
Such governance challenges are subtle and may 
only emerge over time.

Current owners: The value- 
creation playbook
Once they’ve acquired a book, firms can turn their 
attention to driving value. Building on our guidelines 
for closed-book value creation, owners have six 
levers that can collectively improve ROE by up to 
four to seven percentage points (exhibit):

 — Investment performance: optimization of the 
SAA and delivery of alpha within the SAA

 — Capital efficiency: optimization of balance-sheet 
exposures—for example, active management of 
duration gaps

 — Operations/IT improvement: reduction of 
operational costs through simplification  
and modernization

 — Technical excellence: improvement of 

profitability through price adjustments, such as 
reduced surplus sharing

 — Commercial uplift: cross-selling and upselling 

higher-margin products

 — Franchise growth: acquiring new blocks or new 

distribution channels

Most PE firms view the first lever, investment 
performance, as the main way to create value 
for the insurer, as well as for themselves. This 
lever will grow in importance if yields and spreads 
continue to decline. Leading firms typically have 
deep skills in core investment-management areas, 
such as strategic asset allocation, asset/liability 
management, risk management, and reporting, as 
well as access to leading investment teams that 
have delivered alpha.

Capital efficiency is also well-trod ground, and for 
private insurers it presents a greater opportunity 
given their different treatment under generally 
accepted accounting principles, enabling them to

apply a longer-term lens and reduce the cost of 
hedging. However, most firms have yet to explore 
the other levers—operations and IT improvement, 
technical excellence, commercial uplift, and 
franchise growth—at scale. Across all these levers, 
advanced analytics can enable innovative, value-
creating approaches.

Operations/IT improvement
Cost cutting is a paradox for private acquirers of 
insurance books. On one hand, the opportunity is 
tempting: insurers have generally not cut costs as 
fast as other industries, and the books in question 
are often high-cost operations. On the other hand, 
acquirers sometimes underestimate the complexity 
that drives these costs, given the complicated 
nature of multiple legacy systems and nuances 
across policy vintages—to say nothing of new costs 
for postmerger integration. New entrants have 
a particular advantage here, as they can adopt 

a digital-first approach to data and technology, 
unencumbered by legacy-system issues. Our 
preliminary analysis suggests that as PE firms 
achieve scale in insurance, typically defined as at 
least $10 billion of assets, costs can be wrestled 
lower. In our study of a small sample of US and 
European closed-book acquirers, US firms, which 
have typically reached scale, enjoy costs 20 to  
40 percent lower than general life insurers in most 
major operating-cost categories. But European 
acquirers are burdened with costs 30 to 60 percent 
higher, in part due to the more complex books they 
have acquired.

Many of the techniques to address operating and 
IT costs are well understood: process streamlining, 
changes to operating location, and efforts to reduce 
overhead costs are levers most insurers have 
pulled to some degree. Many have also attempted 
to capture scale benefits. To get to the next level, 

90

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022insurers can take a comprehensive look at these 
levers to understand their interdependencies. For 
example, unlocking scale benefits requires action 
to reduce complexity of the book, by offloading 
legacy products, say, or decommissioning legacy IT 
systems. For a GP, this can reduce dividends in the 
short term but offer an attractive return given the 
longer-dated nature of these investments.

New AI techniques, including machine learning, 
can also help insurers capture more of these 
opportunities than was previously possible.  
For example, applying these methods to system 
migration and data extraction allows insurers to 
bring down part of the costs before executing  
an outsourcing contract and therefore retain  
more value.

Technical excellence
Conducting a thorough review of contractual 
terms and finding opportunities to adjust where 
appropriate (for example, through reduced surplus 
sharing) can be a material driver of value. New AI 
skills and modernized IT systems can also bolster 
the ability of insurers to apply technical and 
commercial levers. For example, AI can enhance 
an insurer’s understanding of customer blocks and 
enable it to develop a segmented approach with 
targeted interventions.

Commercial uplift
AI offers additional benefits, such as avoiding 
lapsing through a better understanding of 
customers and identifying opportunities to cross-
sell or upsell. For example, one insurer applied AI 
modeling along with a refreshed strategy for sales 
force optimization. Agents in this program  
delivered between 40 and 250 percent more  
cross-sell revenue than a control group that did  
not use analytics.

Franchise growth
Identifying attractive new blocks and ensuring an 
operating model that can successfully scale without 
raising costs significantly or damaging policyholder 
service is a critical lever. Advanced analytics can 
unlock new opportunities here as well: applying 
machine learning to model policyholder behavior  

in a target book, for example, can be 20 to  
50 percent more accurate than traditional actuarial 
methodology. Combining actuarial and AI techniques 
can unlock significant value as the franchise grows. 
For new entrants, identifying innovative ways to 
grow the franchise can be particularly attractive. 
They might, for example, expand into structured 
settlements, flow reinsurance, or coinsurance 
(particularly for those without manufacturing 
capabilities). There are at least three prominent 
examples of players that began with a closed-book 
focus but now derive significant value from organic 
growth which represents 25 to 50 percent of their 
flows and assets.

Insurers: Fight or flight?
Several leading insurers already exercise the same 
value-creation playbook that PE firms are using. In 
many cases, these insurers are better positioned 
on the operational, technical, and commercial 
levers. For example, by running operations and 
IT transformations or using analytics-powered 
methods to release capital or improve in-force 
earnings, they are creating value despite the 
challenging interest-rate environment.

Insurers are also taking a fresh look at investment 
levers and, in some cases, studying the moves 
made by GPs for potential insights. Many insurers 
are building investment skills, reviewing the 
strategic-asset allocation, and finding new ways 
to secure access to, and generate alpha from, 
higher-yielding, capital-efficient asset classes, 
provided they can effectively manage the risk. In 
more challenging asset classes, some insurers 
are exploring partnership models. For example, at 
least two insurers have recently partnered with 
alternative managers; in these deals, the insurer 
brings operations expertise, and the alternative 
manager can capture the upside from managing 
the credit investments and delivering best-in-
class capabilities for investment performance. The 
arrangement lets the insurer capture a share of 
the upside without having to build or buy all of the 
needed specialist capabilities, and can create a 
structure with which to raise external capital.

Why private equity sees life and annuities as an enticing form of permanent capital

91

For insurers who cannot see a path to building 
leading capabilities or have more attractive 
investment opportunities, sale or reinsurance of 
part or all of a capital-intensive book could free 
up significant capital. To gain the best price, they 
must understand the PE value-creation playbook 
sketched above and strike a fair deal.

The window is firmly open on this once-in-a-
generation opportunity—momentum is building, and 
more investment is sure to come. But as competition 
increases and credit spreads remain low, firms will 
need to evolve their value-creation playbook and 
deploy a broader set of levers to capture the full 
potential from this opportunity.

One final possibility for insurers facing a challenging 
value-creation path: a few insurers could pool their 
challenged assets and build sufficient scale to offer 
a compelling proposition to another insurer, either 
as a purchase or a joint venture.

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022Digitally native brands: 
Born digital, but ready  
to take on the world 

By applying the right criteria, investors can identify digitally native 
brands with the potential to outperform.

Digitally native brands (DNBs) are attracting 
significant investor attention these days—and for 
good reason. DNBs make up an increasing share  
of disruptive players in the market, comprising  
15 percent of the new unicorns funded in 2020, up 
from 10 percent in 2019 and 5 percent in 2018.1 They 
are growing, on average, at triple the rate of overall 
e-commerce,2 while the fastest-growing among  
them have scaled from $50 million in revenues to  
$1 billion in four to eight years.3 The most successful 
consumer-facing brands, including food-delivery 
apps, tech-enabled exercise equipment, and hair-
coloring systems, are innovative category disruptors 
that enjoy intense customer loyalty. 

DNBs’ online origins give them two important 
competitive advantages: deep knowledge of their 
customer base and extensive control over the 
customer file. Whether a DNB is a product, service, 
or a product-service combination, what sets them 
apart is the fact that brand owners know exactly 
who their customers are, what online behavior led 
them to their initial contact with the brand, and  
what they’re likely to buy next. This insight creates 
opportunities to build deep and lasting relationships 
with customers. It’s an advantage that can carry 
over even if, later in their life cycle, DNBs branch into 
brick-and-mortar. 

Today, low barriers to entry have encouraged an 
explosion of DNBs, flooding the market with the fruits 
of creative entrepreneurship. However, DNBs that 
break through with outsize investor returns are rare. 
Over the past two decades, fewer than 0.5 percent  
of DNBs have reached $100 million in revenues. 
In fact, more than 90 percent of businesses that 
originated through e-commerce earn less than  
$1 million in annual revenues (Exhibit 1).4 Investors 
face the challenge of sifting through concepts to 
determine which are worthy of the capital required 
to scale a business or buy into an existing  
company at high multiples. 

attractive their customer file is and how much it will 
cost to acquire new customers. There are four critical 
factors to consider when assessing whether a DNB 
has the potential for outsize performance:

1.  six key metrics

2.  categories with the most potential

3.  essential capabilities 

4.  pitfalls that can derail success

By applying the criteria outlined in each of these 
sections to the research and diligence underlying a 
potential deal, investors have the best shot at  
the golden ring of DNB investing: identifying a 
brand that was born digital but ultimately lives in the 
imagination of the world’s consumers.

Four critical factors to consider when 
assessing a DNB investment
Step one in finding a DNB with “superstar” potential 
requires developing a baseline understanding of the 
core health of the customer file: how well a business 
retains and drives spend in its customer cohorts, 
how much it costs to acquire new cohorts, and how 
much potential there is to improve in both areas. 
These bedrock principles of DNB investing are 
relatively straightforward. Then comes the hard part: 
assessing how well these pieces fit together  
and, crucially, how well they underpin a brand with  
a genuine raison d’être in the DNB landscape. 

Six key metrics
A brand’s investment attractiveness rests largely on 
a handful of key metrics, which include net customer 
growth, year-over-year customer cohort value, 
projected lifetime value (LTV), customer acquisition 
cost (CAC), contribution margin, and total 
addressable market (TAM). (For definitions of terms 
useful to DNB investors, see sidebar, “A glossary of 
terms for DNB investors.”)

There are ways for investors to gauge whether DNBs 
are equipped for growth and future profitability, 
which are primarily grounded in understanding how 

Ultimately, there are a few ratios investors can look 
at based on these metrics that have strong predictive

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022value for future success. One of the most common is the 
LTV:CAC ratio. This measure is essentially the marginal 
return on investment for acquiring every new customer. 
Cross-industry averages dictate a 3:1 LTV:CAC ratio 
as satisfactory5; however, the optimal ratio depends 
on the category dynamics and business model, with 
early-stage players focused on customer recruitment 
tolerating levels as low as 1:1.6 

Another important metric to understand is the overall 
size of the TAM to the size of the current business. This 
figure indicates how much runway the business has 
with its existing offering within the target customer 
base. Before expanding the TAM into new categories, 
geographies, and customer groups, a good ratio that 
indicates further runway is below 5 to 10 percent, 
though the degree of competition and the size of the 
market can make the ideal ratio lower.

In addition, for any business that is still unprofitable, 
tracking how losses change with revenue scaling 

can indicate whether it is gaining any operating 
leverage over time, in particular ensuring that the 
loss ratio is gradually shrinking. 

Categories with the most potential
The original generation of DNBs, which began 
emerging in the 2000s and early 2010s with brands 
such as Warby Parker and Everlane, often focused 
on cutting out the middleman to proffer goods at 
reduced prices or on selling a unique product, or both.

Today, to stand out in the marketplace, DNBs 
must offer even more compelling propositions to 
differentiate themselves from traditional brick-and-
mortar players or e-commerce offerings. The  
most successful brands typically play in categories 
with distinct dynamics, such as predictable and 
routine consumption patterns, personal and gift-
buying tendencies, strong gross margin profiles, 
favorable size/weight ratio for shipping, and low 
likelihood of returns (Exhibit 2).

A glossary of terms for DNB investors

Click-through rate (CTR): a ratio that rep-
resents the percentage of people who click 
on an ad or product listing  
displayed to them

Conversion-rate optimization (CRO): ac-
tions taken to increase the percentage of 
users who perform a desired action  
on a given website (for example, making  
a purchase)

Cost per acquisition (CPA): total cost of ac-
quiring a new customer through a specific 
action or channel

Cross-channel campaign management 
(CCCM): technology and tools associated 
with designing, executing, and measuring 

campaigns across multiple channels (for 
example, online, offline)

Earned media: publicity or visibility  
gained through efforts other than  
paid advertising

Net customer growth: the number of cus-
tomers added by the company  
in a given period, minus the number of 
customers who churned over the  
same period

Next-best product (NBP): predictive 
analytics that help support marketers in 
identifying the right merchandise to offer a 
given customer to get them to purchase

Projected lifetime value (LTV): the total 
contribution margin a company  
expects to earn over the lifetime of its rela-
tionship with a single customer

Share of voice (SOV): share of advertising 
compared with competitors

Next-best offer (NBO): predictive analytics 
that help support marketers in identifying 
the right offer (such as promotions, services, 
information) to put in front of a given cus-
tomer to get them to purchase

Year-over-year customer cohort value:  
the number of overall sales from  
a given customer cohort (for example,  
2017 customers or 2018 customers)  
as time goes on

Some of the magic of DNBs is their ability to  
quickly shift direction and fine-tune assortment, 
product variety, pricing, shipping, deals, product 
combinations, and marketing messages to  
retain and grow their customer base. Successful 
DNBs monitor tiny shifts in consumer browsing  
and purchasing behaviors (for example, trial  
and switch propensity, length of the purchase 
cycle, responsiveness to new offers) to be able to 
constantly refine their value proposition to optimize 
demand and minimize churn. 

Over time, it is essential to move from start-up to 
grown-up and find sufficient scale to leverage  
core infrastructure and build on an active customer 
base. The path we typically see begins with 
expanding beyond the current assortment (for 
example, add-on items, adjacent categories,  
or products geared to new customer segments), 
which expands customers’ share of wallet while  
also attracting potential new consumers. The next 
step is making a move to new geographies (often 
guided by early signs of cross-border purchasing), 

and ultimately entering brick-and-mortar to  
gain greater access to cheaper traffic (Exhibit 3).

A good example of a DNB following this  
playbook is Peloton, which has pulled nearly all the 
aforementioned growth levers on its path to  
$4 billion in revenues in the 2021 fiscal year.7 It 
began by growing across different distribution 
channels (for example, brick-and-mortar shops) and 
categories (such as treadmills and accessories), and 
then pursued new customer segments (for example, 
app-only customers) and new geographies (such as 
Canada and the United Kingdom).8 

These actions can expand the TAM for a given  
brand, allowing them to tap into new pools  
of customers, spending, or both. Successful brands 
approach expansion strategically, using a test- 
and-learn approach to experiment with opportunities 
(such as digital pop-up stores or new products 
offered on a limited basis) before committing to full-
scale implementation.

Essential capabilities
Successful DNB teams rely on four key capabilities: 
they build great relationships with customers;  
they offer these customers compelling reasons 
to shop with them; they pursue avenues to reduce 
customer acquisition costs and, ultimately, the 
payback period; and they use the best and latest 
technology to drive loyalty. DNBs are often  
better positioned than traditional brands to do this 
because of their origins and infrastructure; those 
that embrace more of these best practices will have 
the best chance of outperformance.

 — Community engagement: The most successful 
players aim for a relationship with consumers 
that goes well beyond traditional brand loyalty. 
Instead, they cultivate satisfied customers  
as influencers who foster brand trust and 
community participation, driving engagement 
online through both company-driven and  
user-generated content.  

Brands pursuing a high level of engagement 
must provide excellent customer service, 
including rapid resolution of issues (both directly 
reported and encountered through “social- 
media listening”), loyalty programs, and bonus  
content. For example, Gymshark built a large, 
engaged, self-reinforcing community online  
and offline through grassroots marketing and 
experimen tation across new channels, from 
Spotify to Instagram, and adapted its approach 
with the rise of newer platforms, such as TikTok.9

 — Performance marketing: To manage CAC and 
LTV effectively, high-aspiration DNBs test 
and learn to determine optimal channels for 
acquiring customers. They develop analytics 
that enable them to predict and prevent  
churn (for example, flagging and reengaging 
dormant customers). They use targeted and 
personalized ads, promotions, and referrals to 
increase awareness, traffic, and conversion.

expansion, further diversifica-

Time

Strong conversion-rate-optimization capability 
is another hallmark of a thriving DNB. Successful 
performance marketers take a surgical 
approach to optimizing click-through rate, cost 
per acquisition, paid media (for example,  
paid search, paid social media, display 
advertising, and video advertising), and earned 
media (such as organic search results).

 — Predictive analytics: Winning DNBs capitalize on 
opportunities to grow their current customer base 
by leveraging the deeper data that they can collect 
relative to their brick-and-mortar peers. Using this 
data, DNBs can personalize recommendations and 
offer bundled products and services that delight 
their customers. Based on extensive testing,  
DNBs can provide incentives (such as free samples, 
shipping, and returns) that increase spending.  

DNBs often begin their operations in a lean, 
“scrappy” manner, employing low-cost marketing 
technology stacks that can easily be modified  
to promote experimentation and adapted 
to changing customer or business needs. 
To do so, DNBs often rely on open-source 

technology solutions for managing site 
content. Content-management systems and 
flexible cross-channel campaign-management 
platforms automate and personalize customer 
communication as well as content and product 
offers across the customer journey.  

More sophisticated brands may leverage 
predictive analytics to learn how customers use 
their websites. This insight helps DNBs identify 
the most promising “next-best product” or “next-
best offer” to offer a specific customer, either  
to recommend products for their next purchase 
or replacements if they are not able to buy 
the exact item for which they were originally 
searching. This level of customization requires 
DNBs to create a unified view of each  
customer, often using a customer data platform 
or similar technology solution. 

Pitfalls that can derail success
Investors should be mindful of both conceptual  
and operational risks that can limit growth  
and profitability.

98

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022 
 
 — Constrained total addressable market: DNBs 
that are positioned in narrow niches may face 
challenges growing beyond early-stage levels. 
Investors must look at whether the business 
segment is large enough or expected to grow 
rapidly enough to make scaling feasible, or  
else be willing to bet that the company can 
expand successfully into new market segments.

 — Undifferentiated value proposition and 

innovation: DNBs that don’t offer customers 
a compelling reason to take a risk on a novel, 
online-only product will struggle to gain traction. 
No matter how well-made the product, if it  
could just as easily be sold at the corner store, it 
is unlikely to become a game-changing DNB.  

Brands stand out from the pack by delivering 
products and personality that turn customers into 
staunch and vocal loyalists.10 This requires a fresh 
point of view that customers don’t see in staid 
brands. For example, Madison Reed turned hair-
color buying on its head, so to speak, by offering 
custom color kits that arrive on a recurring 
basis; consumers can request free online color 
consultations designed to imitate sitting in a salon 
chair. Brands that offer highly novel solutions 
sometimes need to overinvest in generating an 
initial trial so that customers get used to the idea.

a path to profitability and the potential to 
improve margins as they scale. To this end, 
strong DNBs work to optimize the value chain 
by increasing their buying power, economies of 
scale, and operational efficiencies.

 — Lack of focus: If DNBs expand their services 
or products to capture a wide customer base 
before first understanding how to win the core, 
they risk building an unsustainable customer 
model with trial but low loyalty.

To be sure, investors must beware the “halo effect,” 
whereby a prospect appears golden because  
it checks off a series of boxes. While the factors 
outlined in this article are indeed associated  
with successful DNB performers, finding a winner  
is more complex than simply verifying that  
these steps are followed. The most compelling 
DNBs started online not because of an 
advantageous customer file or a wide customer 
base but because the product or service itself 
genuinely belonged there and, by existing online, 
solved problems for customers. Investors  
should remember that this core authenticity must  
be in place for the specific approaches outlined  
in this article to contribute to success. 

 — Poor unit economics: Few DNBs turn a profit for 
their first three to five years, and many fail to  
turn a profit even after a decade of growth. Over 
the past 20 years, fewer than 0.5 percent  
of DNBs have reached the $100 million revenue 
level. Even some large, publicly traded DNBs 
reinvest all earnings into additional marketing 
and capacity expansion and fail to turn a  
profit. While DNBs don’t need to be profitable to 
be an attractive investment, investors must  
be wary of DNBs that don’t provide evidence of  

DNBs represent some of the most intriguing 
consumer concepts on the market and provide 
ample opportunity for investors that succeed  
in identifying winners. There is significant risk, 
however, of getting stuck funding companies that 
can’t overcome obstacles to growth. Investors  
can approach DNBs wisely, however, by using the 
ideas presented in this article to help identify  
high-potential concepts. The reward: participating 
in a brand born of the virtual world that grows up  
to make a mark on the real world.

Climate risk and  
the opportunity for  
real estate

Real-estate leaders should revalue assets, decarbonize, and create 
new business opportunities. Here’s how.

by Brodie Boland, Cindy Levy, Rob Palter, and Daniel Stephens

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022Climate change, previously a relatively peripheral 
concern for many real-estate players, has moved 
to the top of the agenda. Recently, investors made 
net-zero commitments, regulators developed 
reporting standards, governments passed laws 
targeting emissions, employees demanded action, 
and tenants demanded more sustainable buildings. 
At the same time, the accelerating physical 
consequences of a changing climate are becoming 
more pronounced as communities face storms, 
floods, fires, extreme heat, and other risks.

These changes have brought a sense of urgency to 
the critical role of real-estate leaders in the climate 
transition, the period until 2050 during which the 
world will feel both the physical effects of climate 
change and the economic, social, and regulatory 
changes necessary to decarbonize. The climate 
transition not only creates new responsibilities for 
real-estate players to both revalue and future-proof 
their portfolios but also brings opportunities to 
create fresh sources of value.

The combination of this economic transition and 
the physical risks of climate change has created 
a significant risk of mispricing real estate across 
markets and asset classes. For example, a major 
North American bank conducted analysis that found 
dozens of assets in its real-estate portfolio that 
would likely be exposed to significant devaluations 
within the next ten years due to factors including 
increased rates of flooding and job losses due 
to the climate transition. Additionally, a study of 
a diversified equity portfolio found that, absent 
mitigating actions, climate risks could reduce annual 
returns toward the end of the decade by as much as 
40 percent.

Leading real-estate players will figure out which 
of their assets are mispriced and in what direction 
and use this insight to inform their investment, 
asset management, and disposition choices. They 
will also decarbonize their assets, attracting 
the trillions of dollars of capital that has been 
committed to net zero and the thousands of 

tenants that have made similar commitments. They 
will then create new revenue sources related to the 
climate transition.

Building climate intelligence is central to value 
creation and strategic differentiation in the real-
estate industry. But the reverse is also true: real 
estate is central to global climate change mitigation 
efforts. Real estate drives approximately 39 percent 
of total global emissions. Approximately 11 percent 
of these emissions are generated by manufacturing 
materials used in buildings (including steel and 
cement), while the rest is emitted from buildings 
themselves and by generating the energy that 
powers buildings.1

In addition to the scale of its contribution to 
total emissions, real estate is critical in global 
decarbonization efforts for reasons likely to be 
compelling for investors, tenants, and governments. 
Significant reductions in emissions associated 
with real estate can be achieved with positive 
economics through technologies that already exist. 
For example, upgrading to more energy-efficient 
lighting systems and installing better insulation 
have positive financial returns. Today, newer 
technologies also make low-carbon heating and 
cooling systems, such as heat pumps and energy-
efficient air conditioning, more cost competitive in 
many markets and climates. These cost-effective 
upgrades can create meaningful change while also 
derisking assets.   

We suggest three actions real-estate players can 
take to thrive throughout the climate transition:

 — Incorporate climate change risks into asset and 
portfolio valuations. This requires building the 
analytical capabilities to understand both direct 
and indirect physical and transition risks. 

 — Decarbonize real-estate assets and portfolios.

 — Create new sources of value and revenue 

streams for investors, tenants, and communities.

Climate risk and the opportunity for real estate

Fundamental changes brought on by the climate 
transition will open new dimensions of competitive 
differentiation and value creation for real-estate 
players. More important, leaders will make a 
valuable contribution to the world’s ability to meet 
the global climate challenge.

building supplied by a carbon-intensive energy 
grid or a carbon-intensive transportation system 
is exposed to the transition risks of those systems 
as well. All these changes add up to substantial 
valuation impacts for even diversified portfolios—
an increasingly pressing concern for real-estate 
companies (see sidebar, “We do mind the gap”).

Incorporate climate change risks into 
asset and portfolio valuations
Climate change’s physical and transition risks touch 
almost every aspect of a building’s operations 
and value. Physical risks are hazards caused by 
a changing climate, including both acute events, 
such as floods, fires, extreme heat, and storms, and 
chronic conditions, such as steadily rising sea levels 
and changing average temperatures. Transition 
risks include changes in the economy, regulation, 
consumer behavior, technology, and other human 
responses to climate change. 

Physical and transition risks can affect assets, 
such as buildings, directly or indirectly, by having 
an impact on the markets with which the assets 
interact. A carbon-intensive building obviously 
faces regulatory, tenancy, investor, and other risks; 
over the long term, so does a building that exists 
in a carbon-intensive ecosystem. For example, a 

Physical risks, both direct and indirect, have an 
uneven effect on asset performance
Several major real-estate companies have recently 
conducted climate stress tests on their portfolios 
and found a significant impact on portfolio value, 
with potential losses for some debt portfolios 
doubling over the next several years. Notably, they 
found significant variation within the portfolios. 
Some assets, because of their carbon footprint, 
location, or tenant composition, would benefit from 
changes brought on by the climate transition, while 
others would suffer significant drops in value. The 
challenge for players is to determine which assets 
will be affected, in what ways, and how to respond. 
There is also opportunity for investors who can 
identify mispriced assets.

Direct physical consequences can be conspicuous: 
the value of homes in Florida exposed to changing 
climate-related risks are depressed by roughly 

We do mind the gap

As we work with real-estate firms, we 
notice that investment teams increasingly 
recognize the impact of climate change on 
asset values. As one leader of valuations at 
a major real-estate-services firm recently 
commented to us: “This is the greatest 
deviation between modeled valuation 
and actual price that I’ve ever seen, and 
it’s because of climate.” A chief operating 
officer of a diversified real-estate investor 
told us, “We’ve seen underperformance 

of a cluster of our assets due to climate-
related factors that just weren’t considered 
in our investment theses.” 

The industry at large senses how values 
are shifting. A recent survey of finance 
experts and professionals conducted by 
researchers at New York University found 
that those who think real-estate asset 
prices reflect climate risks “not enough” 
outnumber those who think they reflect 

climate risks “too much” by 67 to 1 (in 
comparison with stock prices, in which 
the ratio was 20 to 1).1 The International 
Renewable Energy Agency has estimated 
that $7.5 trillion worth of real estate could 
be “stranded”; these are assets that will 
experience major write-downs in value 
given climate risks and the economic 
transition, making real estate one of the 
hardest-hit sectors.2

to the Journal of Urban Economics, after Hurricane 
Sandy, housing prices were reduced by up to 
8 percent in New York’s flood zones by 2017, 
reflecting a greater perception of risk by potential 
buyers.2 In California, there has been a 61 percent 
annual jump in nonrenewals of insurance (due to 
higher prices and refused coverage) in areas of 
moderate-to-very-high fire risk.3

The indirect effects of physical risk on assets can 
be harder to perceive, causing some real-estate 
players to underestimate them. For example, in 
2020, the McKinsey Global Institute modeled 
expected changes in flooding due to climate 
change in Bristol, England. A cluster of major 
corporate headquarters was not directly affected, 
but the transportation arteries to and from the area 
were. The water may never enter the lobby of the 
building, but neither will the tenants.

investors and operators are often left with a major 
capital expense or tax that wasn’t considered in the 
investment memo.  

There is also a host of less direct but potentially 
more significant transition risks that affect 
whole markets. For example, some carbon-
intensive industries are already experiencing 
rapid declines or fluctuations. In Calgary, for 
example, the combination of oil price volatility and 
market-access issues (driven by climate change–
related opposition to pipelines) has dramatically 
depressed revenues from some buildings. Vacancy 
rates in downtown Calgary reached about 
30 percent, a record high, as of January 2021. 
Investors exposed to the Calgary market have  
seen their asset values drop precipitously and  
are left trying to either hold on and hope for a 
reversal of fortunes or exit the assets and take a 
significant loss.  

The climate transition will affect both individual 
buildings and entire real-estate markets
The investments required to avoid or derisk the 
worst physical risks will drive a historic reallocation 
of capital. This will change the structure of our 
economy and impact the value of the markets, 
companies, and companies’ locations. These 
momentous changes require real-estate players 
to look ahead for regulatory, economic, and social 
changes that could impact assets. 

Among the most direct climate-transition impacts 
are regulatory requirements to decarbonize 
buildings, such as New York City’s Local Law 97. 
In June 2019, the Urban Green Council found that 
retrofitting all 50,000 buildings covered by the law 
would create retrofit demand of up to $24.3 billion 
through 2030.4 Standard property valuation 
models generally do not account for the capital 
costs required for a building to decarbonize, and 

Real-estate players should build the capabilities 
to understand climate-related impacts on asset 
performance and values
Real-estate owners and investors will need to 
improve their climate intelligence to understand 
the potential impact of revenue, operating costs, 
capital costs, and capitalization rate on assets. This 
includes developing the analytical capabilities to 
consistently assess both physical and transition 
risks. Analyses should encompass both direct 
effects on assets and indirect effects on the 
markets, systems, and societies with which assets 
interact (Exhibit 1). 

Portfolio and asset managers can map, quantify, 
and forecast climate change’s asset value impact
To understand climate change impact on asset 
values, landlords and investors can develop the 
following capabilities to understand and quantify 
risks and opportunities:

 — Prioritize. Create a detailed assessment of the 
asset or portfolio to determine which physical 
and transition risks are most important and 
which are less important (using criteria such as 
the probability of a risk occurring or the severity 
of that risk).

 — Map building exposures. Determine which 

buildings are exposed to risks, either directly (for 
example, having to pay a carbon tax on building 
emissions) or indirectly (for example, exposure 
to reduction in occupancy as tenants’ industries 
decline because of a carbon tax), and the degree 

104

of exposure (for example, how high floodwaters 
would reach). This could require detailed 
modeling of physical hazards (for example, 
projected changes in flood risks as the climate 
changes) or macro- or microeconomic modeling 
(for example, projected GDP impacts based on 
the carbon price impact on a local geography’s 
energy production mix).

 — Quantify portfolio impact. Combine 

assessments of the economic risks on individual 
buildings into an impact map that enables 
visualization of the entire portfolio (Exhibit 2). This 
requires combining knowledge of the potential 
risk or opportunity and an understanding of what 
drives the economics of a building (including 
drivers of net operating income, tenancy mix, 
and areas of cost variability).  

 — Take action. These capabilities cannot be 

isolated in a research or environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) function but should 

directly inform investment management, 
lease pricing, capital attraction and investor 
relations, asset management, tenant attraction, 
development, and other core businesses. The 
processes within organizations must shift to 
ensure that climate-related insights can be a 
source of real competitive advantage.

A portfolio revaluation informed by climate change 
risks can lead to hard choices but will also open the 
door to acting on decarbonization and exploring 
new opportunities. 

Decarbonize buildings and portfolios
McKinsey research estimates approximately 
$9.2 trillion in annual investment will be required 
globally to support the net-zero transition. If 
the world successfully decarbonizes, the 2050 
economy will look fundamentally different from 
the current economy. If it doesn’t successfully 
decarbonize, the world will experience mounting

physical risks that will strain the foundations of the 
global economy and society. In either case, the 
places where people live, work, shop, and play will 
fundamentally change. 

This approach can be complemented with 
market and policy scenarios that change the 
relative costs and benefits of each potential 
abatement lever.  

Decarbonizing real estate requires considering  
a building’s ecosystem
Ultimately, the only way to reduce the risks of 
climate change is to decarbonize. Real-estate 
players have a wide array of options for how to 
proceed, including low-carbon development and 
construction; building retrofits to improve energy 
efficiency; upgrades to heating, cooling, and 
lighting technology; and technology to manage 
demand and consumption. But decarbonization 
is not solely a technical challenge. To develop the 
most appropriate path, real-estate players need to 
understand the range of decarbonization options 
and their financial and strategic costs and benefits.

Decarbonizing real estate 
To decarbonize, industry players can take the 
following steps:

 — Understand the starting point. Quantify 

baseline emissions of each building. This helps 
real-estate players prioritize where to start (for 
example, individual buildings, asset classes, or 
regions) and determine how far there is to go to 
reach zero emissions.

 — Set targets. Decide which type of 

decarbonization target to set. There is a range 
of potential target-setting standards that take 
different approaches (for example, measuring 
absolute emissions versus emissions intensity, 
or setting targets at the sector level versus 
asset level). Players should develop a “house 
view” on targets that achieve business, investor, 
stakeholder, regulatory, and other objectives.

 — Identify decarbonization levers. Build an asset- 
or portfolio-level abatement curve. A marginal 
abatement cost curve provides a clear view 
of the potential cost/return on investment of 
a given emissions-reduction lever along with 
the impact of that lever on emissions reduction. 

 — Execute. Set up the mechanisms to effectively 
deploy the decarbonization plan. These may 
involve making changes to financing and 
governance, stakeholder engagement (investors, 
joint-venture partners, operators, and tenants), 
and a range of operational and risk-management 
aspects of the business.  

 — Track and improve. As investors, lenders, 

and tenants make their own decarbonization 
commitments, they will need to demonstrate 
that their real estate is indeed decarbonizing. 
Thus, much of the value of decarbonizing will 
come from the ability to demonstrate emissions 
reduction to potential stakeholders. Building 
the ability to monitor and progressively reduce 
emissions on the path to net zero will create an 
opportunity for players to differentiate.

Create new sources of value and 
revenue streams for investors, tenants, 
and communities
As the economy decarbonizes, real-estate players 
can use their locations, connections to utility 
systems, local operational footprints, and climate 
intelligence to create new revenue streams, improve 
asset values, or launch entirely new businesses.  

Opportunities include the following:

 — Local energy generation and storage. Real-
estate firms can use their physical presence 
to generate and store energy. For example, 
property developers have been outfitting 
buildings with solar arrays and batteries, helping 
to stabilize energy grids and reduce the costs 
associated with clean energy.5

 — Green buildings to attract more tenants. 

Developers and property managers can invest 
in developing green buildings or retrofitting 

106

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022older buildings to make them green to meet the 
growing appetite for sustainable workplaces 
and homes. 

 — Green-building materials. Players can explore 
the advantages of green steel, tall timber, 
modular construction, and other emerging 
technologies and materials that may have 
additional benefits, such as faster and lower-
cost construction.

 — Extra services on-site. Firms can introduce  
new revenue streams, including vehicle 
charging, green-facilities management, and 
other on-site services that enable occupants’ 
sustainable preferences. 

 — Services for reducing and tracking emissions. 
Firms can support occupants by tracking 
emissions and offering solutions to reduce 
carbon footprints. These services could 
include smart sensors and tracking energy 
consumption through heating, cooling, lighting, 
and space management. 

 — Differentiated capital attraction. Given 

the volume of capital that has already been 

committed to achieving net zero, firms that are 
able to decarbonize will have an advantage in 
attracting capital. Real-estate players may, for 
example, create specific funds for net-zero 
buildings or investment themes that support 
community-scale decarbonization.

The coming climate transition will create seismic 
shifts in the real-estate industry, changing tenants’ 
and investors’ demands, the value of individual 
assets, and the fundamental approaches to 
developing and operating real estate. Smart 
players will get ahead of these changes and build 
climate intelligence early by understanding the 
implications for asset values, finding opportunities 
to decarbonize, and creating opportunity through 
supporting the transition.

Real estate not only will play a critical role in 
determining whether the world successfully 
decarbonizes but also will continue to reinvent the 
way we live, work, and play through these profound 
physical and economic changes.

Innovating to net zero:  
An executive’s guide  
to climate technology

Advanced technologies are critical to stopping climate change—and 
the drive to develop and scale them is accelerating. Here are five 
themes that could attract $2 trillion of annual investment by 2025.

by Tom Hellstern, Kimberly Henderson, Sean Kane, and Matt Rogers

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022New technologies represent a critical part of the 
world’s decarbonization tool kit—and the world does 
not yet have all the technologies that it would need 
to solve the net-zero equation by balancing sources 
and sinks of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. The 
good news: McKinsey research on Europe’s net-zero 
pathway suggests that climate technologies that 
are already mature could, if deployed widely, deliver 
about 60 percent of the emissions abatement that 
will be needed to stabilize the climate by 2050. The 
challenge is that further abatement must come 
from climate technologies that aren’t quite ready, 
including 25 to 30 percent from technologies that 
are demonstrated but not yet mature and another  
10 to 15 percent from those still in R&D. 

This need for innovation makes the pace of 
decarbonization difficult to predict. When, for 
example, will clean hydrogen cost $1 per kilogram: 
in 2025 or 2050? The answer will affect the speed 
at which industries from aviation to steel can 
decarbonize. Similarly, unless manufacturers of 

utility-scale batteries can make them at low cost, 
power producers will have to keep running fossil 
fleets to cope with the intermittency of renewables. 
Uncertainty about the availability of financing for 
innovation limits capital formation and slows scale-
up. Integrating most climate technologies into 
existing infrastructure, hardware, software, and 
operational systems will be complicated, too.   

Yet there are reasons to be optimistic. Recent 
history suggests that researchers and businesses 
can deliver the necessary advances and cost 
reductions (see sidebar, “Charting cost reductions 
for climate technologies”). Over the past decade, 
the cost of some renewable-energy projects 
came down by almost 90 percent, as did the 
costs of electric-vehicle (EV) batteries, LED 
lighting, and other energy-efficient hardware. 
Capital is increasingly plentiful, evidenced by 
the revaluation of cleantech stocks that began 
in June 2020, and by the growth in investments 
earmarked for sustainability and environmental, 

Charting cost reductions for climate technologies

Absent incentives, climate technologies 
must compete with high-emissions 
technologies based on cost, efficiency, 
performance, and other attributes 
unrelated to their environmental benefits. 
Of these, high cost can be a significant 
barrier to widespread uptake—but not a 
permanent barrier. If demand for climate 
technologies is sustained over time, then 
manufacturers can create production 
efficiencies that allow them to reduce  
costs (exhibit).

For example, solar-power generation 
achieved cost parity with coal power 
in 2013 and gas power in 20151—after 
more than 30 years of research and 
investment, during which solar-module 
costs fell by about 98 percent and 
about $270 million worth of panels were 
deployed. Analysis suggests that the 
cost reductions occurred in two phases, 
each of which saw cost declines of about 
85 percent in the cost of solar modules. 
During the first phase, between 1980 
and 2000, R&D investments accounted 

for the majority of cost reductions, and 
deployments of solar modules were 
relatively small (about $15 billion). Then, 
from 2000 to 2014, governments offered 
incentives, via mechanisms such as 
feed-in tariffs and renewable portfolio 
standards, that encouraged utilities and 
other organizations to buy and install solar 
systems. Roughly $255 billion of solar 
modules were sold over this time frame, 
with economies of scale and “learning by 
doing” in manufacturing accounting for the 
majority of cost reductions.2

social, and corporate governance (ESG) objectives. 
Governments are lending strong fiscal support 
to low-carbon innovation. Pledges from big 
companies not only to cut emissions but also to 
decarbonize operations and product lines—to 
buy only renewable fuel or make only EVs—give 
confidence to entrepreneurs and their backers. 
Talk of regulatory mandates lends weight to these 
demand signals.

And, again, the need for climate technology is 
vast—which creates large potential markets and 
investment opportunities. Our estimates suggest 
that next-generation technologies could attract 
$1.5 trillion to $2 trillion of capital investment per 
year by 2025.1 To enter these markets and navigate 
them successfully, established companies, start-
ups, and investors will need a nuanced and ever-
evolving understanding of technical advances, 
customer demands and commitments, and policy 
environments. In this article, we lay out five areas 
with considerable promise, along with potential 
obstacles along the path to scale (Exhibit 1):

 — electrifying transportation, buildings,  

and industry

 — launching the next green revolution  

in agriculture

 — remaking the power grid to supply  

clean electricity

 — delivering on the promise of hydrogen 

and processes that now run on hydrocarbons and 
converting the electric-power system to renewable 
sources (see next section). Many forms of electric 
gear, from EV batteries to heat pumps to industrial 
furnaces, remain expensive. Further innovation will 
be needed to reduce costs and increase uptake 
of the electric hardware that will drive a net-zero 
society. 

Better EV batteries. Electrifying transportation 
requires cutting the cost of batteries, which can 
account for as much as half the cost of an EV. 
However, the lithium-ion batteries that are most 
common in EVs may never fall below the critical 
threshold of $100 per kilowatt-hour. To boost 
energy density and cut costs, battery chemistry will 
have to improve. Companies are working on anodes 
with high silicon content, which represent the next 
frontier. Beyond that, innovations in solid-state, 
gel, and foam electrolytes would turn ultra-high-
capacity lithium metal anodes from a concept  
into a reality, and one that is safer than today’s 
battery technology.

Battery-control software. Hardware improvements 
aren’t the only route to better batteries. Software 
control systems can also help, and even make up for 
shortfalls in chemistry. They can shorten charging 
times: imagine recharging an EV with a 300-mile 
range in ten minutes or less, instead of one hour at 
a supercharger or overnight on most home systems. 
They can prolong battery lives enough to match the 
life of the vehicle. And they could give EVs added 
pickup or hauling or towing capacity.

 — expanding carbon capture, use, and storage 

Electrifying transportation, buildings, 
and industry
Coal, oil, and gas have been the main fuels used to 
power buildings, industrial machines, and vehicles 
since the early 20th century. Getting to net-zero 
emissions will require electrifying most equipment

abatement potential are sized assuming that net-zero emissions are achieved in 2050, based on McKinsey’s 1.5°C scenario. These include only

about 7 percent of global CO2 emissions. Cutting 
those emissions would require making buildings 
more energy efficient with technologies such as LED 
lighting, high-efficiency HVAC, and energy controls. 
But efficiency alone isn’t enough. Buildings, like 
vehicles, have to go electric. Using heat pumps to 
keep buildings warm, instead of traditional boilers 
and furnaces, could cut global CO2 emissions by 
three gigatons per year if implemented worldwide. 
Today’s models are 2.2 to 4.5 times more efficient 
than gas furnaces, and recent advances, such as 
multiple or variable-speed compressors, let heat 
pumps work in cold conditions that once caused 
problems. Heat pumps do remain expensive, so cost 
declines, especially for air-source heat pumps, would 
likely have to happen before they are used widely.2 
In addition, energy-reactive windows and those 
with embedded solar cells could enable buildings to 
generate all the power they need.

Industrial electrification. As prices of renewable 
electricity and electric equipment drop, industrial 
companies could lower costs and emissions by 
electrifying their operations. The opportunity 
appears large. Industrial sectors such as cement, 
chemicals, and steel together consume more energy 
than other sectors (such as electric power and 
transportation), and only 20 percent of that energy 
is electricity. What’s more, electrical equipment is 
less costly and more reliable for many industrial 
applications, though not all. Electric furnaces, for 
example, can make heat up to 350°C, but not the 
high heat of up to 1,000°C that many industrial 
processes need. Innovation will be needed to 
address these gaps. There is also the question of 
how to finance industrial electrification. Replacing 
long-lived equipment early can mean writing it 
off, and industrial products tend to have tight 
profit margins, which can discourage companies 
from making big capital outlays. New financial 
mechanisms could help companies cover the 
up-front cost of electric equipment even with the 
long payback period. 

Launching the next green revolution  
in agriculture
Agriculture accounts for about 20 percent of global 
GHG emissions. The most significant GHG from 
agriculture is methane, which has many times 
the warming power of CO2. Reducing methane 
emissions from agriculture (and other sources) 
would require major changes to how society farms, 
eats, manages supplies and waste, and stewards 
cropland and forests. Many of the changes would  
be enabled by climate technologies, some of  
which are relatively mature while others need  
further development.

abatement by 2050

Bringing these technologies to the more than two 
billion people who work in agriculture will be one 
of the most difficult tasks on any path to 1.5°C of 
warming, requiring cost reductions, assistance 
programs, and infrastructure (such as distributed 
clean energy). These developments would amount 
to a new green revolution, one with the potential 
to surpass the gains that were realized as efficient 
farming practices were applied widely in the 1960s. 
These are some of the technologies that could 
decarbonize agriculture. 

Zero-emissions farm equipment. The largest 
amount of on-farm emissions abatement could 
be achieved by shifting from traditional fossil-
fuel equipment and machinery—such as tractors, 
harvesters, and dryers—to their zero-emissions 
counterparts. The economic potential is significant:

Climate risk and the opportunity for real estate

113

deployment of zero-emissions equipment could 
produce cost savings of $229 per ton of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Nevertheless, uptake 
of zero-emissions farm equipment and machinery 
is far behind that of EVs; most varieties are still 
in the proof-of-concept or prototype phases. 
Cost reductions and supportive financing would 
accelerate adoption.   

Meat alternatives. Between one-quarter and one-
third of global methane emissions are estimated 
to come from the digestive processes of cattle, 
sheep, and other ruminant animals. Those emissions 
will be difficult to abate unless consumers opt to 
change their diets. But some of the meat and dairy 
that people now eat could be healthfully, and cost-
effectively, replaced with protein from crops such 
as legumes and pulses. This may require more land 
and different planting practices but could also 
reduce deforestation related to the clearing of land 
for pasture. Lab technology also points toward 
meat substitutes. Some are plant-based: Beyond 
Meat and Impossible Foods are two of the leading 
names in the field. Cultivated meats—those grown 
in bioreactors from animal cells—are also advancing. 
McKinsey research suggests that this could become 
a $25 billion global industry by 2030.  

Methane inhibitors. Companies are developing feed 
supplements and substitutes that inhibit methane 
production by altering an animal’s digestive 
processes. Trials have shown that these can 
reduce methane production by 30 to 50 percent. 
Propionate precursors—a class of free acids or salts, 
such as sodium acrylate or sodium fumarate—have 
been shown to inhibit methane emissions from 
cattle without affecting animals’ growth, and one of 
these has entered the EU approval process. 

Anaerobic manure processing. Manure from 
cattle and hogs can release significant amounts of 
methane. Processing manure in anaerobic digesters 
can cut emissions and also generate biogas, a 
renewable form of natural gas that can be used 
on farms, sold to the grid, or fed into production 
of “gold hydrogen.” Such digesters are now used, 
though not widely, to control odor and pathogens. 

But companies are partnering with agriculture and 
landfill sites to produce biogas for various purposes, 
such as making compressed natural gas, which 
counts as a transport fuel under California’s low-
carbon fuel standard.

Bioengineering. Bioengineering advances 
agricultural productivity and carbon sequestration 
and thereby lowers the sector’s emissions. 
Promising technologies include editing of plant 
genes to promote disease resistance and manage 
the soil microbiome. 

Remaking the power grid to deliver 
clean electricity
Almost everywhere, power grids are old, inefficient, 
unreliable—and carbon-intensive. They are 
nowhere near ready to handle the doubling of 
electricity demand that could take place by 2050 
as electrification happens, let alone prevent a 
commensurate increase in carbon emissions. 
Modernizing and decarbonizing the grid involves 
three main tasks. One is speeding the installation of 
renewable-generation capacity; to achieve a 1.5°C 
pathway, we estimate that the global installation rate 
would need to increase from three gigawatts per 
week to 15 to 18 gigawatts. Another task is adding 
energy-storage capacity to manage the intermittency 
of solar and wind. Last is upgrading the transmission 
and distribution network to accommodate more 
front-of-the-meter and behind-the-meter assets.

Few utilities are known as risk takers. For the most 
part, they are set up—and required by regulators—
to deploy proven, mature technologies. These 
tendencies present limitations. But if innovators

McKinsey on Investing Number 8, December 2022and grid operators work together (for example, on 
accelerating the scale-up of long-duration storage) 
and regulators send helpful signals (for example, 
by defining mechanisms to reward providers of 
battery storage and other services that help deal 
with intermittency), then the following technologies 
could help create a zero-carbon grid.

Long-duration storage. Even with falling solar 
and wind costs, as well as cheaper lithium-ion 
batteries, the intermittency of renewables makes 
these technologies impractical as the sole source 
of grid power. A solution is long-duration energy 
storage, which can store enough power to supply 
a network for two weeks or more (a typical period 
of limited renewable generation in many markets). 
In comparison, lithium-ion batteries can provide 
backup power cost-effectively for only four hours. At 
a levelized cost3 of less than $20 per kilowatt-hour, 
long-duration storage would make 100 percent 
renewable systems cost-competitive in US states 
with ample wind and solar resources. Storage costs 
of $150 per kilowatt-hour would allow very high wind 
and solar penetration, provided that power systems 
also include strong demand-side management, 
backup gas turbines, or more integration of 
regional transmission networks.4 Multiple storage 
technologies are emerging, including power-to-gas, 
flow batteries, and compressed or liquefied air. Big 
and small companies are active in this market, and 
start-ups are pioneering more advanced options such 
as mechanical systems and modular pumped hydro.

Advanced controls. Today, grid utilization tends 
to average below 50 percent because the grid is 
built for times of peak demand and its performance 
worsens in extreme heat or cold. As more 
renewables and storage systems are deployed at 
the grid edge, in homes and commercial sites, they 
will make power grids more complicated to operate. 
Resilience, flexibility, safety, and efficiency can be 
improved with technologies such as solid-state 
transformers, advanced flexible AC controllers that 
allow more controlled grid flow, and high-voltage DC 
technologies for data centers.

Software and communications. Traditional 
electrical grids use idling power plants to maintain 
grid balance. These so-called spinning reserves 
are expensive to run but can respond quickly when 
demand fluctuates. Modern electric grids would 
rely on ultrafast communications to maintain grid 
balance by managing every device on the network. 
Software-defined inertial substitution (to maintain 
grid balance when there are fewer spinning 
reserves), advanced “volt-var” management (to 
maintain proper voltage over long transmission 
lines or in highly congested urban markets), and 
network-wide instrumentation for condition 
monitoring and fault isolation would help utilities 
spot issues and prevent interruptions. Distributed 
energy-management software can coordinate all 
these elements. Digitized grids will require better 
cybersecurity protection.

Vehicle-to-grid integration. As more drivers switch 
to EVs, the big batteries in their driveways and 
garages could be hooked up to the grid to provide 
energy-storage capacity. One million typical EVs 
would offer about 75 gigawatts of storage, hundreds 
of times more than today’s single biggest utility-
scale storage facility provides. Residential backup 
batteries add more. Accomplishing this integration 
requires technologies such as inverters that connect 
rooftop solar, wall batteries, EV batteries, and the 
grid, as well as fast chargers that buffer the grid 
from demand spikes while keeping EV batteries full.

Building-to-grid integration. As buildings’ energy 
controls improve, the buildings can be dispatched to 
the grid—that is, used to supply power—in ways that 
improve system performance. Buildings with energy 
storage or cogeneration could feed power onto 
the grid when called for, producing income for their 
owners. And if a utility could reduce power demand 
slightly in a central business district by signaling 
buildings to turn down lights, it could cope with 
demand spikes less expensively than by turning on a 
gas peaker plant. 

3 The levelized cost of storage refers to the full cost, per kilowatt-hour, of setting up and running a battery-storage facility.

Next-generation nuclear. Nuclear energy has an 
uneven history: from the 1950s’ promise of “too 
cheap to meter” energy to construction-cost 
overruns in the 1970s to post-Fukushima fears. Now, 
the push to decarbonize power has lent new appeal 
to nuclear generation, which is emissions-free. 
Emerging technologies include the sodium-cooled, 
molten salt, and helium-cooled reactors known 
as “GenIV”; small, sealed, modular, factory-built 
reactors; and fusion energy, an area where new 
start-ups are pushing costs down and timelines 
forward to prototype devices in the mid-2020s, 
ahead of government-backed research programs.

large-scale hydrogen projects announced between 
February and July 2021, bringing the total to more 
than 350. Direct investment in these projects, which 
would produce 11 million tons of hydrogen annually, 
is expected to top $130 billion.5 

Hydrogen has a long way to go to fulfill its potential. 
An entire infrastructure of pipes and storage facilities 
would have to be built, at great expense. Europe is 
responding with a plan, the EU Hydrogen Backbone,6 
to link low-cost supply centers with European 
demand centers. Other technologies integral to the 
hydrogen economy include the following.

High-efficiency materials. Scientific advances 
could produce materials for a wide range of 
clean-energy applications. Solar cells made 
with perovskites, a special type of crystal, could 
outperform regular silicon solar cells—and cost less 
to make. Graphene, a single-atom-thick sheet of 
carbon, could revolutionize batteries (by enhancing 
conductivity and storage capacity), solar cells (by 
offering superior conductivity contacts with lower 
light blockage), and high-efficiency transmission 
lines to carry power from remote but productive 
renewable-generation sites.

Scaling up the use of hydrogen
Hydrogen could play a significant role in 
decarbonization, as a clean-energy carrier or fuel 
ingredient with many applications. High-energy 
density and zero-carbon combustion make 
hydrogen well suited to address the 30 percent 
of GHG emissions—across sectors as diverse as 
aviation and shipping, industry, buildings, and 
road transport—that would be hard to abate with 
electricity alone. Hydrogen could ultimately satisfy 
15 to 20 percent of energy demand.

Low-cost production. If hydrogen could be made 
for less than $2 per kilogram in the European 
Union or $1 per kilogram in parts of the United 
States by 2030, major end uses would become 
economically viable. One production process is the 
electrolysis of water, whereby electricity is used 
to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen 
atoms. If electrolyzers run on renewable electricity, 
the resulting “green hydrogen” is carbon-free. (By 
comparison, “blue” hydrogen, made from natural 
gas, is carbon-intensive.) Estimates suggest that 
electrolyzer costs could fall 60 to 80 percent over 
the next decade.7  

Road-transport fuel. Hydrogen’s higher energy 
density makes hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicles 
(FCEVs) suitable for long-haul or heavy road 
transport. For FCEVs to be adopted widely, they 
would need to become less expensive, and fueling 
stations would need to be built.

hydrogen technologies stalled. Now it has new 
momentum. The Hydrogen Council identified 131

Ammonia production. This is one of the most 
promising near-term uses for low-carbon hydrogen. 
Green ammonia, made with green hydrogen, should 
be the first variety to match the cost of conventional 
ammonia production. Hydrogen is also relatively 
straightforward to integrate in ammonia production, 
so less supporting infrastructure is required. And 
ammonia can be used as a fuel or as a “vector” for 
transporting hydrogen. 

Steel production. The steel sector is one of the 
largest industrial emitters, producing about 7 to 
9 percent of global emissions. The conventional 
blast furnace–basic oxygen furnace route for steel 
production emits approximately 1.8 tons of carbon 
per ton of steel. But using green hydrogen to power 
the direct reduction of iron as a feedstock for 
electric arc furnaces (which could also be powered 
by renewables) is one route to zero-carbon steel. 
Major steel producers in Europe are now piloting 
steel production with hydrogen.

Aviation fuel. As the travel industry recovers from 
the COVID-19 pandemic, air travel is expected to 
produce 3 percent of global carbon emissions. 
These emissions will be hard to abate until planes 
are made to fly on fuels other than petroleum-based 
jet fuel. The best near-term alternative, according 
to the Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, may be 
sustainable aviation fuels made from renewable 
feedstocks such as agricultural biomass. Within 
the next decade, hydrogen could provide electric 
power for smaller aircraft equipped with fuel cells. 
Eventually, hydrogen could be used for combustion 
in larger planes.

Expanding carbon capture, use,  
and storage
Carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) is 
necessary to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors 
and to remove CO2 from the atmosphere (resulting 
in “negative emissions”). Presently, use of CCUS is 
minimal. Costs remain prohibitively high—typically 
$50 to $100 per ton of CO2 (tCO2)—and CCUS 
equipment consumes a lot of energy. Rollout of 
CCUS has generally stalled at second- or third-of-
a-kind commercial-scale installations at coal or gas 
power plants, steel plants, and refineries.

Moreover, innovation has been slow. Many existing 
CCUS plants employ 30-year-old solvent-based 
technologies for postcombustion carbon capture. 
But new technologies are emerging. Further R&D 
would be needed to reduce costs, and additional 
incentives will likely be required to make CCUS 
financially viable at commercial scale. But if the full 
cost of CCUS were to fall below $50/tCO2, it would 
make many applications economical. Here are some 
CCUS technologies that could help.

Pre- and postcombustion capture technologies. 
Precombustion technologies such as oxyfuel 
combustion represent promising ways to affordably 
capture CO2 from point sources since they increase 
the concentration of CO2 in flue gases. Development 
of new postcombustion technologies, such as 
second-generation solvent formulations, sorbents, 
and membranes, is helping bring down the cost of 
capture. Companies, governments, philanthropy, 
venture-capital, and growth-equity firms have all 
helped finance improvements in capture technology. 

Direct air capture (DAC). Withdrawing CO2 from 
ambient air is difficult because air has, at most, 
one one-hundredth of the CO2 concentration 
found in flue gases from industrial point sources. 
Nevertheless, DAC offers a way of removing CO2 
from the atmosphere—and the world is likely to 
need many different sources of negative emissions 
to achieve a 1.5°C pathway. To that end, several 
companies are investing in DAC, with the goal of 
achieving capture costs of $100/tCO2 to $150/tCO2 
by 2030, 60 to 80 percent less than today’s pilot 
projects. Low-cost DAC, coupled with low-cost 
hydrogen, could enable production of carbon-
neutral e-fuels in the near to medium term. 

Climate risk and the opportunity for real estate

117

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage 
(BECCS). Many fossil-powered plants are nowhere 
near the end of their useful lives. Taking plants 
offline before they are due would burden utilities 
with stranded assets. But the value of these assets 
could be preserved by converting them to run on 
biomass, a renewable fuel. Adding CCS equipment 
to a bioenergy plant lets it produce negative 
emissions: biomass sequesters CO2 as it grows, and 
when that biomass is burned, the CCS system keeps 
the CO2 from entering the atmosphere.

Biochar. Biochar is a stable, charcoal-like material 
made by processing waste biomass such as 
crop residues through pyrolysis or gasification. 
Adding biochar to soil can improve soil health and 
agricultural productivity, opening the door for use in 
large-scale farming. This practice could sequester 
nearly 2 gigatons of CO2 per year by 2050. Adoption 
rates will depend on the results of commercial-scale 
experiments over the next decade.

CO2-enriched concrete. Concrete has two main 
components: cement, which is the “glue” that holds 
concrete together; and aggregate, such as sand 
or crushed stone, which gives concrete most of 

its mass. Both have heavy carbon footprints, but 
companies are working on solutions that would 
sequester CO2 in concrete itself. Technologies for 
adding CO2 as an ingredient in cement could reduce 
emissions by up to 70 percent and make cement 
stronger. Emerging processes might combine 
captured CO2 with industrial-waste products such as 
fly ash, steel slag, and remediated cement to make 
artificial “rocks” for use in place of natural aggregate.

These climate technologies could contribute to 
solving the net-zero equation while creating growth 
potential for sectors and geographies. At present, 
the technologies exhibit varying levels of maturity, 
performance, market demand, and regulatory 
support. To bring them to commercial, climate-
stabilizing scale would require companies, financial 
institutions, and governments to cooperate on 
investment and research programs as well as efforts 
to integrate technologies with existing industrial 
systems. This challenge is formidable, but the 
moment to devote creativity, capital, and conviction 
to addressing it is now.
