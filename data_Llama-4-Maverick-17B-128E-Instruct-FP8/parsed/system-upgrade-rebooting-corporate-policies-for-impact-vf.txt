SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTPREFACE

One of the greatest strengths of our society is our diversity. The United States is 
made up of people with so many different perspectives, and we are collectively more 
innovative as a result. Ironically, though, a lack of diversity remains a defining feature 
in the tech industry and broader technical workforce, which are supposed to be at the 
forefront of innovation. Barely more than 25 percent of employees in the sector are 
women, and just over 4 percent are Black, Latina, or Native American (BLNA) women.1 

Pivotal Ventures is committed to expanding women’s power and influence. To achieve 
that goal, we invest in helping women—especially women of color—advance in key 
professions where they have been systematically underrepresented. That’s why we 
support the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition.

The coalition was formed by 11 companies in 2018 to double the 
number of BLNA women graduating with computing degrees by 
2025. Less than five years later, the coalition has expanded to 21 
members and six partners and has collectively pledged more than 
$26 million to BLNA women in computing. With help from many 
partners,  they’ve  almost  achieved  their  doubling  goal.  That’s 
the good news. There are more BLNA technologists than ever 
graduating from college, ready to step into the workforce. 

The  bad  news  is  that,  despite  these  gains,  BLNA  women’s 
representation in technical roles in the workforce is actually shrinking; 
it’s dropped by more than 10 percent in the past four years.2

The Reboot Coalition’s success at the college level proves that rapid 
progress is possible with a strong commitment, thoughtful strategy, 
and deep collaboration. The next step is to get similar results in the 
workplace so that BLNA computing graduates don’t just get degrees 
but actually get jobs in tech, thrive in their roles, and advance to 
leadership positions. 

Technology jobs can give millions of people new opportunities 
and keep our economy healthy—but only if all technologists get 
the support they need at every step in their professional journeys. 
Reboot is working hard to make sure they do.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTFOREWORD

What makes a good company great? 

A relentless commitment to the long term. An ability to use insightful 
data to make informed decisions. And probably most important, a 
continued investment in its people. Companies that invest in talent 
don’t just stay afloat in difficult times; they thrive in the long run.

Today, technology transcends industry. Across sectors, technologists 
bring innovation, growth, and advancements to companies of all 
shades. What’s more, technology jobs continue to be engines of 
economic growth and social mobility. 

When we published our first Rebooting Representation report in 
2018, the share of Black, Latina, and Native American (BLNA) 
women  receiving  computing  degrees  was  declining.  But  the 
efforts of our partners and countless other organizations across 
the ecosystem helped turn that around. The number of computing 
degrees awarded to BLNA women nearly doubled between 2016 
and 2021, but continued intentional investments will be required to 
sustain and propel these efforts. 

More BLNA women are ready to enter the technical workforce, 
but corporations have failed to realize gains by retaining them. In 
fact, representation of BLNA women in the technical workforce is 
shrinking; it dropped by more than 10 percent in the past four years.3 
Further, tech women’s attrition more than doubled in 2022, with 
BLNA women technologists exiting their companies at the highest 
rates.4 

Through a recent survey of more than 2,000 employees in technical roles, we identified 
cornerstone policies that drive the most impact while addressing employee needs. We also sought 
to understand company perspectives and uncover gaps in current offerings. 

As companies face constrained resources, we are excited to share a practical and feasible set 
of critical talent investment steps that will also enable companies to capitalize on the growing 
number of BLNA women graduating with computing degrees.

It is our hope that this analysis will arm companies with concrete guidance for adding new 
cornerstone policies and practices or enhancing the ones they already have. This will allow 
companies to better recruit and retain BLNA women and enhance opportunities for all their 
employees.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTEXECUTIVE SUMMARY

All great leaders want and need their people to thrive at work. Companies that 
consistently invest in their core talent tend to outperform their competitors and are 
more likely to thrive long term.

For years, companies have invested significant time and resources 
in improving representation and inclusion in the workplace. Yet 
there is still little concrete and lasting progress, particularly when 
it comes to the inclusion of Black, Latina, and Native American 
(BLNA) women in the technical workforce. This report is an effort 
to understand why, as well as what works to change that reality. 

When we published the first Rebooting Representation report in 
2018, the number of BLNA women receiving computing degrees 
wasn’t just low—it was declining. The collective power of the 
Reboot Representation Tech Coalition partners and countless 
others across the ecosystem helped turn those numbers around. 
The number of computing degrees awarded to BLNA women 
nearly doubled between 2016 and 2021. That’s worth celebrating. 

We’ve come a long way, and we know where to double down 
next: retention in the workplace. In the same moment that we see 
an increase in degree conferrals, BLNA women’s representation 
in the technical workforce is shrinking—dropping by more than 10 
percent in the past four years (from 4.6 percent in 2018 to 4.1 
percent in 2022)5—compared with 16.5 percent in the working-
age population as a whole.6 To consolidate educational gains and 
build a workforce of thriving technologists, companies need to act. 

Companies must be more intentional about ensuring that their talent strategies 
explicitly address employee needs at the intersection of gender and race or ethnicity. 
This is a smart way to prioritize talent efforts and get the most out of the investments 
companies are already making in their talent, especially at a time in which companies 
are being asked to stretch resources. When done right, this effort could lay the 
foundation for a more supportive workplace for additional groups that face steep 
barriers in the technical workforce and, ultimately, help all employees thrive. 

6

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTCompanies have a clear and tangible opportunity to reverse the decline in BLNA 
women’s representation in the technical workforce. We surveyed more than 2,000 
BLNA women in technical roles and their peers from other demographic groups about 
38 specific policies and practices at their organizations. In addition to our survey, 
this report builds on existing research, much of which focuses on the experiences of 
BLNA women (such as their sense of belonging at work). We found that, while current 
policies and practices aren’t quite hitting the mark for BLNA women in technology, 
there are concrete actions employers can take that would positively affect the 
workplace experience for BLNA women—and all employees—in technical roles. Our 
research shows the following:

•  Companies are offering policies and practices that aren’t being used. 
Only 32 percent of BLNA women said they used more than half of 
the policies and practices referenced in the survey, compared with 43 
percent of all other demographic groups. That means the investments 
companies are making in offering these policies and practices are not 
yet achieving their full potential for impact.

•  Companies should prioritize nine cornerstone policies and practices. BLNA women said nine policies and 
practices had the most impact on their ability to join their company, stay there, or advance within it.7 These nine 
interventions address three key employee needs: 

Democratizing access to information 
to level the playing field:

Increasing flexibility, enabling employees 
to work the way they work best:

01 Share salary ranges so people 

know what they can expect.

02

Create an accessible 
internal jobs board so 
employees can understand 
opportunities across the 
organization.

03 Assign mentors to support 

candidates in the interview 
process by clarifying the pro-
cess, answering questions, 
and helping candidates pre-
pare for interviews.

work remotely, hybrid, or on-site.

•  An investment in these cornerstone policies is an investment in 
employee retention. BLNA women whose organizations offer all nine 
cornerstone policies and practices reported being more than 75 percent 
more likely to stay at their companies than BLNA women at companies 
that do not offer all nine.

•  These policies benefit the entire workforce. Employees from all other 
demographic groups reported being nearly 80 percent more likely to 
be satisfied with their work experience at organizations that offered all 
nine cornerstone policies and practices.

charting clear pathways for employee 
career advancement:

Offer professional-development 
programs to help employees

and rotation opportunities).

09

Provide actionable next steps

advancement directly following 
a performance review.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTJust 36 percent of all respondents reported that their 
company currently offered all nine cornerstone policies 
and practices.8 Offering the full package is a crucial start 
for leaders who want to move the needle for BLNA women 
in the technical workforce.

Companies that do offer the cornerstone policies have 
an opportunity to take advantage of data disaggregated 
simult aneously  by  race  or  ethnicit y  and  gender. 
Disaggregated data enables companies to increase the 
return on their investment in policies and practices by 
uncovering hidden barriers to impact. Only 46 percent 
of BLNA women reported that their employer’s average 
existing cornerstone policies were designed to be accessible 
and effective for them, 16 percentage points lower than 
what their peers reported.9 That might not be surprising: the 
significant majority of companies surveyed and interviewed 
for this research had not yet set goals, measured progress, 
or tracked outcomes at the intersection of race and gender.

By exploring existing policies and practices from both 
corporate  and  technologist  perspectives,  this  report 
provides a road map to help companies prioritize the tactics 
that will make the most of limited time and resources. It 
includes key opportunities for action along with tools and 
resources to support companies in creating environments 
in which all employees feel supported and contribute fully.

To create lasting progress, business leaders must tap into three familiar (but critical) 
factors for success: collecting and disaggregating data at the intersection of race 
or ethnicity and gender to sharpen decision making; delivering results and fulfilling 
the promises that have been made to employees by focusing on the highest-impact 
practices; and iterating and improving continuously by centering the needs of BLNA 
women technologists to create a workplace in which all employees can truly thrive.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTCALL TO ACTION

Join us in creating a workplace that better supports BLNA women (and thereby all 
employees) by taking three critical steps:

A.
            Leverage disaggregated data
Use data disaggregated simultaneously by race or ethnicity, gender, and role (for 
example, technical versus nontechnical) to build a fact base, identify root causes and 
areas of opportunity, and measure progress across the organization in the following 
areas:

•  Uptake of policies and practices

•  Satisfaction with policies and practices

•  Interim outcomes (for example, promotions among those who had used 

a professional-development program)

•  Ultimate outcomes (such as representation and lower turnover at each 

seniority level of the organization and for technical-specific roles)  

Review results of disaggregated analyses at least quarterly with senior leaders to plan 
action steps.

SETTING THE STAGE

In the face of uncertainty, talent is crucial to a 
company’s ability to compete and win in tech

‘We don’t have a choice but to 
invest in talent long term if 
we want to stay competitive in 
our line of business.’ 

V P O F  TA L EN T,  T EC H N O LO G Y  H A R DWA R E CO M PA N Y 

11

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACT42 percent of all surveyed technical 
employees say they are ‘very likely’ or 
‘somewhat likely’ to look for a new job 
in the next 12 months.

In an uncertain and challenging macroeconomic environment, many 
companies are facing pressure to scale back organizational-health 
efforts. 

It’s critical that companies resist implementing strategies that put 
short-term gains ahead of the development and retention of their key 
talent. The normal cycle of business has historically included periods of 
contraction quickly followed by expansion, and it will likely continue to 
do so. Companies that prioritize effective and intentional investments in 
their core talent during an economic downturn are poised to come out 
ahead, retaining employees with the most essential skills and reaping 
benefits that could allow them to outperform their competitors and 
thrive in the long term.

Companies that look past the short term and focus 
on the long term can reap significant benefits
Organizations that consistently focused their decision making on the 
long-term implications of their strategy (as opposed to the pursuit of 
short-term gains) earned 47 percent more revenue and saw 36 percent 
higher earnings growth over a 15-year period, according to McKinsey 
research.10 Results were good for workers as well—the same companies 
added nearly 12,000 more jobs (on average per company) than their 
peers over the same period of time.11  

Companies are facing a challenging environment, and many may need 
to cut costs to relieve the pressure. But the most successful companies 
are the ones that continue investing in innovation and other key 
differentiators—such as technical talent—even as they reduce costs 
elsewhere. 

DEFINING ‘TECH’

This report focuses on the technical workforce in 
the United States, which means those with the skills 
to drive technological innovation, including roles in 
software, IT services, data science, and engineering. 

Technical  workers  are  at  the  cut ting  edge  of 
reshaping the economy—an economy that is not 
currently structured to serve or to support Black, 
Latina,  and  Native  American  women.  The  work 
of employees in technical roles can grow or shrink 
societal  disparities—and  can  have  that  impact 
through  channels  as  varied  as  how  algorithms 
distribute  opportunities  to  whose  needs  novel 
inventions serve.

In  today’s  world,  technology  often  transcends 
industry. We looked at how companies are engaging 
the technical workforce in businesses that sell goods 
and services in electronics, software, computers, AI, 
and other IT-related industries, as well as companies 
in other industries that rely on technologies such 
as physical infrastructure, hardware, and software 
to deliver value directly to customers or improve 
internal operations. 

The insights included in this report focus on the 
United  States,  but  many  of  the  companies  that 
participated in this research have operations across 
the globe. These international operations may have 
different needs given regional market and cultural 
dynamics.

1 2

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTTaking a long-term view involves real trade-offs, which can be 
difficult for business leaders to navigate in an economic downturn. 
However, intentionally investing in areas (such as talent retention)
that fuel long-term growth can help companies maximize profits 
in the long run. In practice, it means investing more (and more 
consistently) even when everyone else seems to be scaling back.  

Companies that invest in core talent are more 
likely to thrive long term
Consistently investing in talent is crucial and gives companies 
the best chance to compete during times of growth and remain 
resilient during cycles of uncertainty. 

Research published by the McKinsey Global Institute based on an 
analysis of 1,800 companies found that companies that invested 
in human capital “are more consistent and resilient performers.”12 

The  study  highlighted  two  subsets  of  companies:  People  + 
Performance Winners, which excel at creating opportunities for 
employees to build skills (measured by internal mobility, training 
hours,  and  organizational-health  scores)  while  consistently 
outperforming competitors financially, and Performance-Driven 
Companies, which can achieve above-average financial results but 
put less emphasis on people and culture. The companies in the 
first category significantly outranked all other companies when it 
came to consistency and resilience, as measured by their likelihood 
to outperform competitors and their peak pandemic revenue 
growth.13

CASE STUDY 

How investment during a crisis enabled 
a stronger position once the turmoil 
subsided 
During the 2000 recession, one large retailer shuttered 
some underperforming facilities but grew its workforce 
by 10 percent to support new high-end products and 
services. 

One of its core competitors, on the other hand, reduced its 
workforce by 6 percent. Despite creating new incentives 
to boost sales, the competitor’s sales growth fell from 19 
percent before the downturn to 8 percent after.

The retailer that made investments in people, by contrast, 
came out of the recession stronger and more profitable—
sales doubled between 1997 and 2003. On average, 
the company that invested was about 30 percent more 
profitable than its competitor three years after the crisis.1 

1  Ranjay Gulati, Nitin Nohria, and Franz Wohlgezogen, “Roaring out of 

recession,” Harvard Business Review, March 2010.

Even in times of acute crisis (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), People + Performance 
Winners were more likely to avoid taking major hits. They were 11.0 percentage points 
less likely than Performance-Driven Companies to see return on invested capital drop 
by 0.5 percentage points or more from 2019 to 2020. Notably, they were also able to 
grow revenue twice as fast (8 percent versus 4 percent).14

Despite headlines to the contrary, the race for technical 
talent is far from over
The layoffs of more than 260,000 workers since fall 2022 across both technical roles 
and other roles in the technology sector have garnered big headlines.15 

But it would be a mistake for companies to think the competition for technical talent 
is over. The majority (59 percent) of technical workers are employed by companies 
outside of the formal tech sector, where the layoff risk is lower.16 

13

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTEven with the layoffs, the number of people working in technical 
occupations is at an all-time high, at more than 6.6 million people,17 and 
unemployment remains strikingly low—2.2 percent compared with 3.6 
percent for all jobs in March 2023.18 

Companies that want to remain competitive—and position themselves 
to excel in the future—will benefit from holding on to their core 
technical talent. In the fast-moving world of technology, this means not 
only helping people with technical skills enter the workforce but also 
helping them stay there and thrive. 

Companies can commit to a through-cycle 
vision of success by continuing to invest in their 
technical talent
With the constant rise of new technologies, companies need technical 
talent to unlock growth. Technology businesses can’t expect to win 
without ensuring they have the right people—not just for the short 
term but also for the long term—to enable consistently fast action. 

And this technical talent may be at risk: our research shows that 
42 percent of all technical employees say they are “very likely” or 
“somewhat likely” to look for a new job in the next 12 months. 

The cost of not committing to a through-cycle approach is high. The 
departure of an employee can cost a company approximately 1.5 to 2.0 
times the employee’s annual salary, because resources must shift to 
recruit, onboard, and train someone new (an often lengthy and time-
consuming process).19 At the same time, productivity suffers while the 
role remains unfilled or as the replacement ramps up. A VP of talent at 
a large technology company shared, “The products that we make are 
cutting-edge, and there is a long ramp-up for onboarding and building 
the necessary level of expertise within our technical workforce. We 
don’t have a choice but to invest in talent long term if we want to stay 
competitive in our line of business.”

Companies that consistently invest in their people are investing in their 
ability to compete and win.  

In this challenging climate, continuing to invest in talent can seem 
difficult. Companies are forced to make tough decisions, and business 
leaders are asked to do more with less. But technology companies 
already possess the core strengths they need to navigate potential 
downturns successfully—their ability to collect and disaggregate data, 
deliver results, and iterate and improve continuously. 

The chapters that follow offer tools to help organizations prioritize the 
right set of talent efforts.

SUPPORTING 
BLNA WOMEN

Why it’s important to focus on Black, Latina, 
and Native American women in technical roles

‘We have tons of data, but we 
don’t have a lens into the 
breakdown of our “people 
of color” category. This is a 
problem for us because it can be 
misleading and doesn’t help us 
pinpoint where representation 
issues really lie.’ 

D I R EC TO R , T EC H N O LO G Y PRO D U C T A N D  S ERV I C E S CO M PA N Y

1 5

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTBlack, Latina, and Native American women 
are the most severely underrepresented 
demographic group in the technical workforce. 
Despite accounting for  16.5 percent  of the total 
working-age population in the United States, 
they represent only  4.1 percent  of all technical 
roles.20

In the face of uncertainty, companies should be intentional about allocating valuable 
resources. 

Implementing a through-cycle people strategy to support core talent through the 
natural upswings and downturns of the business cycle may feel overwhelming given 
that companies already face many other challenges and constraints. However, an 
organizing framework—designing strategies to respond to the needs of groups facing 
the greatest challenges—can help, and it ultimately benefits the entire workforce.

Solving  for  those  who  face  some  of  the  steepest 
barriers enables leaders to address the needs of other 
employee groups facing a milder version of some of the 
same challenges without microsegmenting their entire 
workforce to identify and address a huge variety of 
pain points. When it comes to technical talent, leaders 
can be most strategic with their resources by designing 
efforts with a specific focus on Black, Latina, and Native 
American women.  

CASE STUDY 

What do targeted approaches that benefit 
everyone look like in practice?
Pressed by disability rights activists in the early 1970s, the city 
of Berkeley, California, installed its first official “curb cut” at an 
intersection on Telegraph Avenue. Curb cuts—small ramps that 
are built into the curb of a sidewalk—were originally designed to 
address the specific needs of wheelchair users, who face some of 
the highest barriers to mobility in public spaces.1 

As curb cuts became more prevalent throughout the country, 
they not only improved mobility for wheelchair users but also 
improved safety and ease of movement for all users—people 
pushing strollers or carts, wheeling luggage, riding bicycles, and 
even running or walking.   

This is a simple but powerful example of how a tailored approach 
to address the specific challenges and needs experienced by one 
community or audience (in this case, wheelchair users) can create 
an environment that enables everyone to participate more fully. 

1  Angela Glover Blackwell, “The curb-cut effect,” Stanford Social Innovation Review, 

Winter 2017. This case study is an illustrative example of how targeted approaches 
can work in practice. It is not a road map or direct analogy for corporate practices 
addressing the intersection of race and gender.

16

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTA targeted, intentional approach that focuses on BLNA women should be a priority for 
corporate leaders for three reasons:

•  Diverse companies tend to outperform others.

•  BLNA women are underrepresented in the US technical workforce and 

face compounded barriers at the intersection of race and gender.

•  Centering  on  the  needs  of  BLNA  women  offers  companies  an 
opportunity to make serious commitments to talent and make the most 
of their resources. 

In the spirit of efficiency, some companies may be tempted to deprioritize the needs 
of BLNA women as an underrepresented portion of the technical workforce (4.1 
percent). But focusing on the needs of those with the lowest representation is one 
of the most efficient decisions leaders can make if they are serious about investing in 
talent.

In addressing the challenges that BLNA women experience in the technical workforce, 
companies can create environments that enable all their employees to feel supported 
and contribute fully, while expending fewer resources.  

As one director at a large technology company put it, “We were looking at our 
advancement data and saw imbalances in our rates of promotion across races/
ethnicities and genders. We ended up implementing a review process 
where when a colleague [a White man] is up for promotion, we look for 
other employees who have similar professional profiles but may identify 
themselves differently to see if they are ready for promotion too. Even 
if they aren’t, it’s an opportunity for us to build out more intentional 
promotion readiness plans for our employees. From this, we didn’t just 
see more equitable rates of promotion, but we also saw more employees 
getting promoted! When you solve for the most marginalized groups, 
you tend to see a benefit for others as well.”   

Diverse companies tend to outperform others

The strong and positive correlation between diversity and organizational 
performance has been well documented in research. There is no trade-
off between the two—in fact, more-diverse companies on average 
have higher profits. And the business imperative for improving the 
representation and inclusion of traditionally underrepresented groups 
has only increased over time.

For example, a McKinsey study found that companies in the top quartile 
in terms of the representation of women were 25 percent more likely 
than others to have above-average financial returns, and the companies 
in the top quartile for racial or ethnic representation were 36 percent 
more likely than others to have financial returns above their national 
industry median.21

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTThis analysis also found that the likelihood of gender-diverse companies outperforming 
competitors was increasing over time. The likelihood of the most gender-diverse 
companies seeing above-average financial returns rose from 15 percent in 2014 to 
25 percent in 2019 (Exhibit 1).22

companies committed to diversity tend to be more successful. A range of interrelated 
factors may contribute to this result: 

•  Diverse companies tend to be more innovative. Companies with above-
average diversity outperformed competitors by 19 percent in terms of 
innovation revenues (products less than three years old), on average.23

•  Teams with multiple perspectives are more likely to make 
better decisions. Companies whose teams reflect the makeup 
of potential consumers are more likely to anticipate shifts in 
consumer needs and consumption patterns.24

As one global head of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging 
at a financial services company said, “We need to be able to 
create diversified products, identifying new opportunities 
through a deep understanding of all the customers we are 
currently serving, as well as those we could potentially serve in 
the future. The only way to do that is to hire an employee base 
that actually represents all those communities.” 

•  Companies  committed  to  diversity  may  be  better  able 
to attract and retain top talent.  Seventy-two percent of 
respondents from demographic groups other than BLNA 
women reported that an employer’s commitment to diversity, 
equity, and inclusion (DEI) is important to them. 

Women leaders are 1.5 times as likely as their male counterparts to say 
they left a job in the past because they wanted to work at a company 
more committed to DEI—and these factors are especially important to 
younger candidates. Women under 30 are ten percentage points more 
likely than their more senior counterparts to say DEI has become more 
important to them in the past two years.25

•  Companies that invest in DEI tend to see greater employee satisfaction 
and retention. Organizations with DEI departments saw higher levels 
of employee satisfaction (across all employee groups) than companies 
without them, receiving approximately 6 percent higher ratings in terms 
of culture and values and about 4 percent higher ratings overall.26 

But merely increasing diversity through hiring will not suffice. Given the current 
slowdown in hiring, there are other ways to commit to ongoing organizational 
investments in inclusion to attract new employees when recruitment does ramp 
up. Companies can benefit from being intentional about how they are engaging 
and supporting employees—particularly those who are most underrepresented in 
the technical workforce—to retain them and enable them to thrive. This is not only 
the right thing to do; it can also be a competitive advantage, allowing companies to 
unlock the immense value of attracting and retaining people with a wide range of lived 
experiences. 

19

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTOVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, COMPANIES HAVE 
MADE PROMINENT COMMITMENTS TO SUPPORTIVE 
AND INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENTS

Corporate commitments to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) 
soared in response to the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others; the 
rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in the summer of 2020; and decades of 
disinvestment. Publicly, more than 2,400 CEOs signed a pledge asserting that diversity 
and inclusion are priorities.1 And according to some estimates, companies committed 
upwards of $340 billion to support racial justice between May 2020 and October 
2022.2 These commitments include the following examples: 

Committing $175 million to Black businesses and promising 
to diversify leadership 

Making a $10 million donation to ‘groups working 
on racial justice’

Setting goals to increase the number of Black employees by 20 percent 

Dedicating more than $1 billion to initiatives for closing 
the racial wealth gap 

Investing more than $100 million in lenders promoting 
racial equality 

Committing to spending more than $2 billion with Black-owned 
businesses by 2025

However, support has started to wane. While there has been growth in total 
committed amounts, the pace of monetary commitments has slowed year over year 
(down 32 percent since 2021).3 Further, additional research suggests that the actual 
amount of funding deployed is only a small fraction of what was pledged.4 This report 
provides an opportunity for companies, especially those that have already made public 
commitments, to stay true to their words and take action on those pledges.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTBlack, Latina, and Native American women are severely 
underrepresented in the US technical workforce
Despite accounting for 16.5 percent of the total working-age population in the United 
States,27 BLNA women are the most severely underrepresented demographic group in 
the technical workforce, representing only 4.1 percent of all technical roles.28

Historically, many efforts to improve representation in the technical workforce 
have treated women largely as a monolithic group, and people of color as a separate 
monolithic group. For example, a director at a technology product and services 
provider shared, “We have tons of data, but we don’t have a lens into the breakdown 
of our ‘people of color’ category. This is a problem because it can be misleading and 
doesn’t help pinpoint where representation issues really lie.” 

Although this monolithic approach may seem efficient and straightforward, it 
leaves value on the table and means companies aren’t getting as much out of their 
investments as they could be. Just as companies collect and analyze data for different 
customer segments while developing and marketing new products, they can do the 
same to ascertain what their employees really need.

Looking at overall workforce trends alone makes it difficult 
to surgically diagnose gaps, since needs and preferences 
across different communities can vary greatly. But there 
is room to take a more tailored approach when designing 
or prioritizing solutions within an organization. As one 
vice president at an IT services company cautioned, “By 
not taking a more nuanced approach to data, we may 
be missing the immense diversity of the barriers certain 
communities are facing within our company.”

BLNA women in the technical workforce 
face steep barriers
In  par t  because  BLNA  women  are  so  significantly 
underrepresented in the technical workforce, they face 
steeper barriers and challenges at the intersection of race 
and gender than many of their peers (see sidebar “BLNA 
women experience a host of challenges and barriers that 
make it more difficult to thrive in the technical workplace”). 
Therefore, deeply tuning into the needs of BLNA women 
can benefit not only them but also others who have been 
systemically excluded from the technology sector.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING AN 
INTERSECTIONAL APPROACH

All  of  the  27  companies  that  provided  data  said  they  set 
organizational goals, measured areas of progress, or tracked 
outcomes related to diversity, equity, and inclusion by either race 
and ethnicity or gender.

By stark contrast, the significant majority of companies surveyed 
or interviewed said they did not set goals, measure progress, or 
track outcomes at the intersection of race or ethnicity and gender, 
even for their internal purposes. This aligns with findings from 
the 2022 Top companies for women technologists report from 
AnitaB.org, which found that only 12.5 percent of companies 
published representation data at the intersection of race and 
gender.1

Companies can effectively take action to support Black, Latina, 
and Native American women only if they understand the pain 
points and outcomes for them specifically. Disaggregating data 
with an intersectional approach is a central first step.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTBLNA WOMEN EXPERIENCE A HOST OF CHALLENGES 
AND BARRIERS THAT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO 
THRIVE IN THE TECHNICAL WORKPLACE  

Black, Latina, and Native American (BLNA) women face challenges 
and barriers related to both their gender and their race or ethnicity. 
For  example,  they  experience  more  microaggressions,  lack 
support from supervisors when it comes to their development and 
advancement, and feel an increased sense of isolation and lack of 
belonging.1 In our research, approximately 40 percent of BLNA 
women reported experiencing prejudice related to gender or race 
at work.2 These biases can range from having their competence 
and expertise questioned to being penalized for certain types of 
behaviors based on racial or gender stereotypes. 

‘I don’t see other Black women at work, so I 
often feel like I’m not really supposed to be 
there or like I can’t be myself. It’s hard to make 
connections with the team … you can’t really be 
your authentic self when everyone around you 
makes you feel different.’ 
B L AC K  WO M A N , S E N I O R  P R O D U C T M A N AG E R , 

S TA R T- U P

Lack of representation of BLNA women in the technical workforce 
leads to isolation.  At  work,  BLNA  women  interact  with  very 
few colleagues who look like them, which can lead to feelings of 
isolation and being “othered.” Women may struggle to maintain a 
sense of identity or self and feel they need to adjust their behavior 
to assimilate. This can have a negative impact on their sense of 
belonging and overall experience at work. 

‘When you’re starting out, you don’t always 
know who to go to, how to navigate things [like] 
being assertive or [navigating motherhood]. 
There isn’t too much support or too many role 
models.’ 
N AT I V E A M E R I C A N  WO M A N , T EC H N I C A L  I N T E R N

BLNA women receive less support from supervisors and sponsors. 
Biases show up not just in daily interactions with team members 
and colleagues but also in how BLNA women in technical roles 
receive support from managers. According to our research, only 
26 percent of BLNA women felt their manager or another leader 
was supportive, compared with 35 percent of all other demographic 
groups in technical roles.3 

‘I have had to make it a point to talk to my current 
manager about sponsorship. I’m not sure that my male 
colleagues have had to do the same. There’s a difference 
between mentorship and sponsorship. I feel like 
managers are always game to mentor, and that’s great, 
but I don’t need guidance and advice—what I need is for 
someone to open doors for me; to promote and advocate 
for my work with the people I don’t have access to.’ 
L AT I N A , S O F T WA R E  E N G I N E E R , F I N T EC H

‘As a Black woman in tech, I feel that my 
managers and teammates automatically profile 
me. I feel that I am challenged more than my 
male counterparts—my input is questioned, 
my advice is brushed off. In every single 
organization I’ve worked for, the reality is that I 
feel that I need to prove myself ten times over.’

‘When I first joined the team, I felt like my skill

supervisor was assigning to me. It felt like 
a lot of administrative work. I kept getting 
complimented for being ‘so organized.’ That’s 
great, but that’s not my skill set—that’s not 
what I went to school for and what the company 
hired me to do.’

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTCompanies can make the most of their resources by focusing 
on the needs of the most underrepresented population in 
technical roles: BLNA women 
To truly get their talent strategy right (and make the most of the resources they are 
spending), companies should seek to center their policies and practices on the experiences 
of the groups that have historically been most overlooked and underrepresented. In 
doing so, organizations stand to create impact for those who face the largest challenges, 
while simultaneously delivering value to all other employees as well. 

In tech, this means addressing the specific needs of BLNA women. To reach and engage 
BLNA women effectively, companies must be more intentional about ensuring their 
talent strategy explicitly addresses employee needs at the intersection of gender and 
race or ethnicity. Doing so would enable companies to address a significant majority of 
the barriers faced by other employees. It would also lay the foundation to deepen the 
intersectional approach in the future and help to create a more supportive workplace in 
which all employees can thrive.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTThe representation of BLNA women in the 
technical workforce fell more than  10 percent 
from 2018 to 2022.

The number of BLNA women earning computing degrees nearly doubled from 2016 
to 2021. 

As these women graduate and enter the workforce, they will face a grim reality: in the 
technical workforce, the needle has moved, but not in the right direction.  

This backsliding is particularly concerning given the rhetoric and resources businesses 
have devoted to improving representation in the workplace in the past several years; 
companies spent an estimated $7.5 billion on DEI-related efforts in 2020.29 And it’s 
a huge loss for companies that are competing for scarce talent and stand to benefit 
greatly from the expertise and diverse perspectives of BLNA women technologists. 

There is still time to reverse this trend. But companies need to act.

‘Companies need to be more 
proactive about helping [BLNA 
women] navigate the path to 
career advancement—being 
told to “be good at your job and 
it’ll figure itself out” is just not 
enough for me.’

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTMore BLNA women stand ready to enter the technical 
workforce
Until recently, representation of BLNA women among computing graduates was 
moving in the wrong direction: our 2018 Rebooting Representation report found that 
the share of computing degrees going to BLNA women decreased by one-third (from 
6 percent to 4 percent) between 2006 and 2016.30 

But there is reason for optimism: the past five years have witnessed an increasing 
number of BLNA women ready to enter the technical workforce. The number of 
computing degrees awarded to BLNA women increased by 1.83 times between 
2016 and 2021 (2,815 versus 5,151), an increase that was far faster than their overall 
growth in the US population (Exhibit 2).

Two primary factors drove this growth: a significant uptick in overall computing 
degrees, which increased by 62.5 percent between 2016 and 2021 across all 
demographics, and an increase in the share of computing degrees earned by BLNA 
women specifically (see sidebar “Progress has been fueled in part by the collective 
commitment of companies and other organizations”).

COLLECTIVE COMMITMENT OF COMPANIES AND OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS  

The Reboot Representation Tech Coalition comprises 27 coalition members and 
partners committed to doubling the number of Black, Latina, and Native American 
(BLNA) women graduating with computing bachelor’s degrees by 2025. Since its 
founding, the coalition has harnessed the power of targeted philanthropy, combining 
contributions from multiple companies to create a larger grantmaking fund that’s 
dedicated to expanding the pipeline of BLNA women in computing. Members have 
collectively pledged more than $26 million to support BLNA women in computing, 
including pooled contributions of $16 million regranted by Reboot. 

Reboot’s grantmaking programs have focused on recruiting BLNA women to study 
computing and on bolstering support to ensure they are successful on their journey. 

Recruitment. Reboot developed a program with the KIPP 
Charter School Network to increase the organization’s capacity 
to provide computer science (CS) education and recruit more 
BLNA girls into CS classrooms. To do this, Reboot funded 
a weeklong summer training session to equip educators to 
teach AP Computer Science, assigning participants to monthly 
cohorts of peer teachers for continued support. Reboot also 
provided financial incentives to drive student recruitment; 
schools that reached gender parity in AP CS courses received 
additional funds. 

As a result of this program, KIPP increased enrollment in AP CS 
from approximately 120 students to 791 students, including 
389 girls, 368 of whom (95 percent) identified as Black or Latina.

Retention. Reboot’s grantmaking has focused on four key areas 
of retention in computing education: addressing academic 
needs, building a community of peers, increasing students’ 
access to career and professional development, and funding 
incentives  for  completing  coursework.  Many  of  Reboot’s 
grantees run programs that cut across multiple areas.

retention among existing members, Reboot’s grant funds two 
affinity groups—Black Wings and Latinas de RTC. Reboot’s 
support has enabled RTC to grow the two groups to 2,100 and 
1,228 members, respectively.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTThe growth in absolute numbers is certainly worth celebrating. But there’s still a 
lot more to do (see sidebar “The COVID-19 pandemic also threatens to reverse 
educational progress”). 

While the decrease in representation from 2006 to 2016 has slowly started to 
reverse, BLNA women still only represented 4.7 percent of all computing degree 
graduates in 2021 (compared with 4.2 percent in 2016) and remain underrepresented 
in comparison with other demographic groups (Exhibit 3).

THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ALSO THREATENS TO REVERSE 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 

The entire ecosystem may suffer due to the educational setbacks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The full extent of the pandemic’s long-term effects is difficult to quantify, but learning loss and enrollment 
declines may disproportionately affect Black, Latina, and Native American (BLNA) women. For example, 
recent evidence found that the pandemic exacerbated educational inequities for Black and Latino 
students. Before COVID-19 vaccines became available, 11 percent of Latino students and 10 percent 
of Black students canceled their postsecondary education plans for the fall of 2021 (compared with 6.4 
percent of the total population).1

Despite their gains in computing education, BLNA women’s representation in the 
technical workforce has fallen—dropping by more than 10 percent in the past four 
years, from 4.6 percent in 2018 to 4.1 percent in 2022 (Exhibit 4).31

This implies that, despite their efforts, companies have not been successful at 
recruiting and retaining the wave of new BLNA women technologists entering the 
workforce at the scale needed to hold representation steady, much less increase it. 
What’s more, tech women’s attrition more than doubled in 2022, with BLNA women 
technologists exiting their companies at the highest rates.32

derail representation if companies continue on their current 
course
Belt-tightening in preparation for a challenging macroeconomic climate may be 
discouraging some companies from prioritizing efforts to support all kinds of 
underrepresented groups in the technology sector. These actions appear to be 
affecting women and people of color disproportionately. 

For example, early data as tech industry layoffs began to gain 
steam  in  fall  2022  showed  that  women  accounted  for  46 
percent  of  layoffs  in  the  technology  industry,  though  they 
make up only 39 percent of workers in the industry overall.33 
Similar  early  analysis  over  the  same  time  period  found  that 
Black and Latino workers were laid off at a higher rate than their 
baseline industry representation.34 While the impact of layoffs 
is still being measured (and still shifting month by month), early 
indications of a disproportionate effect on groups that are already 
underrepresented will be a critical area to keep a close eye on 
as the data emerges. And of the employees holding technical 
roles across industries who completed our survey in February 
and March 2023, 51 percent of BLNA women reported being 
concerned about being laid off, compared with only 41 percent of 
all other demographic groups.

‘In the past several years I have seen a shift—a 
groundswell of support and commitment across 
the corporate landscape that was very inspiring. 
But I always feared that it would be temporary, 
and I feel that fear may be coming true. I have 
been really discouraged to see companies pulling 
back—I feel the urgency we once felt around these 
issues has waned.’

This  may  be  par tially  because 
the  average  tenure  of  workers 
who  lost  jobs  in  2022  was  just

may have adopted a “last in, first

neutralit y.  However,  adopting 
layoff policies based on position 
and tenure may also increase the 
likelihood that underrepresented 
employees are let go, particularly 
as many companies increased their 
efforts in diverse hiring in recent 
years. 

COMPANIES SHOULD NOT RELY SOLELY ON HIRING TO 
IMPROVE REPRESENTATION

Moments of significant hiring and of mass layoffs provide the most immediate 
opportunities to see significant changes in representation numbers—for good or for ill. 

But simply hiring diverse talent is not the full solution to improving workforce rep-
resentation. Companies must also examine their cultures to truly engage and retain 
Black, Latina, and Native American employees, both those newly hired and those who 
have a history with the organization.

‘For far too long, organizations have focused on hiring, but they haven’t 
focused on changing the conditions once people have been hired. One 
of the standard approaches to DEI is to say, “We just need to hire more 
women and people of color.” That’s a really important initiative; I 
totally endorse it. But it’s not the answer. What we have seen over the 
past 25 years is many organizations hiring women and hiring people 
of color and then having them leave. The really important message is 
that you have to interrupt bias in your basic business systems—not only 
in hiring but in performance evaluations. Where patterns of bias very 
commonly play out.’

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTBusiness leaders have a choice
Both BLNA women and their employers stand to lose—or gain—from this inflection 
point. 

The situation is simple: despite the rhetoric about addressing workplace equity and 
inclusion, things have gotten worse for BLNA women in the technical workforce. 
BLNA women’s representation in the technical workforce today is lower than it was 
five years ago, and that is not acceptable. 

Companies  have  a  choice.  They  can 
attempt to ensure that the educational 
gains achieved so far translate to lasting 
progress in the workplace. Or they can 
maintain the status quo—and risk turning 
back the clock on an entire generation of 
talented BLNA women. As one manager 
of  organizational  development  for  a 
technology solutions company shared, 
“Nobody in our organization wants Black, 
Latina, and Native American women to 
fail. It’s insidious—it happens without us 
knowing that it’s going on. But that’s not 
a good enough excuse. If we don’t start 
doing better, we are going to keep losing 
valuable talent.” 

The leaders who take a through-cycle 
approach even in a temporary economic 
downturn will benefit from the technical 
talent of a far greater number of BLNA 
women who will be equipped to enter 
the sector in the next couple of years. 
This will be a competitive advantage—
companies  that  make  this  investment 
will have far more BLNA women who 
can become role models and continue to 
attract and inspire future generations of 
top BLNA talent (see sidebar “Employers’ 
actions  may  have  more  influence  on 
retention of BLNA women than on that 
of other groups”). 

EMPLOYERS’ ACTIONS MAY HAVE MORE INFLUENCE 
ON RETENTION OF BLNA WOMEN THAN ON THAT OF 
OTHER GROUPS

More than 70 percent of Black, Latina, and Native American (BLNA) women said 
they had not yet decided whether to seek a new job in the next year or stay at their 
current organization (exhibit). By contrast, other technical employees were more 
likely to already be convinced of a set path, and respondents in the control group 
were more likely to be set on seeking a new job in the next year. 

This indicates that BLNA women may be more responsive to company action. 
Companies willing to invest have a real opportunity to retain valuable employees. 
Those that miss the moment to act will risk losing key talent and further exacerbating 
the underrepresentation of BLNA women.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTOur research found that BLNA women who work 
at organizations that offer all nine cornerstone 
policies and practices were more than  
75 percent more likely to stay longer than BLNA 
women at companies that did not offer all nine.

Many organizations are deeply committed to accelerating progress that 
enables all their employees to thrive. Some companies are gaining traction 
by investing in policies and practices that have a positive impact on BLNA 
women in technical roles (see sidebar “Defining ‘policies and practices’”). 

But there is still a lot of work left to do to refine these policies and practices.

The path to action may feel ambiguous and overwhelming, particularly 
when companies are facing other challenges and constraints. The goal of 
this report is to offer a clear road map so that organizations can prioritize 
and tailor the most crucial actions that move the needle for BLNA women 
in the technical workforce. 

‘[I would] appreciate more insight on 
navigating the workplace. Part of it can be 
the people you talk to and what they know. 
You may not know the unwritten things 
that you’re supposed to be doing—like how 
to navigate conflict or what it looks like to 
progress.’

The recommendations in this chapter are based on the nine cornerstone policies and 
practices that BLNA women identified as most impactful. These policies and practices 
fall into three themes:

•  Democratize access to information to level the playing field

•  Increase flexibility, empowering employees to work the way they work best

•  Demystify development by charting clear pathways for employee career 

advancement

3 3

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTOnly 36 percent of BLNA women reported that their companies currently offer all 
nine cornerstones. Companies can take the first step in turning these insights into 
action by offering all nine.

For  companies  that  seize  this  oppor tunit y, 
the impact could be significant. At companies 
that offered all nine cornerstone policies and 
practices, BLNA women reported being over 75 
percent more likely to stay at their organization 
longer than BLNA women at companies that did 
not offer all nine.

Collectively, these policies and practices have 
substantial  benefits  for  all  employees,  not 
just  BLNA  women:  employees  from  all  other 
demographic  groups  were  nearly  80  percent 
more  likely  to  be  satisfied  with  their  work 
experience when their companies offered all nine 
cornerstones.

To  be  clear,  simply  of fering  these  policies 
and practices will not achieve the full impact. 
However, ensuring they are accessible to BLNA 
women  will.  While  the  policies  seem  basic, 
ensuring  accessibility  is  a  crucial  and  often 
overlooked step. This chapter will also provide an 
initial road map for companies on how to get the 
greatest value out of the policies and practices 
they are already investing in.

DEFINING ‘POLICIES AND PRACTICES’

This report uses the term “policies and practices” to refer to the internal 
efforts and initiatives offered by business leaders to provide support 
throughout the employee life cycle, from hiring to employee engagement, 
career development, and advancement. 

Our employee survey focused on 38 distinct policies and practices 
identified through extensive external research and expert interviews (for 
a detailed list, see “Scope and methodology” on page 57). We focused on 
policies and practices that are visible to employees, as opposed to ones 
that take place entirely behind the scenes or out of view of employees 
below senior leadership levels. Surveyed practices include HR practices 
such as having diverse candidate pools for open roles, employee benefits 
such as personal leave or childcare subsidies, and initiatives such as formal 
mentorship or sponsorship programs that include training and resources 
for mentors or sponsors. 

In addition to our survey, this report builds on existing research, much of 
which focuses on the subjective experiences of Black, Latina, and Native 
American (BLNA) women (such as their sense of belonging at work). By 
contrast, this report creates a more tactical set of recommendations that 
are within an organization’s immediate control. 

WHY THESE POLICIES AND PRACTICES MATTER 
TO THE BOTTOM LINE 

When done well, these immediate actions can lead to increased feelings 
of belonging and satisfaction at work. This is good for business: higher 
employee satisfaction has been shown to be associated with improved 
company performance, including in the areas of customer experience, 
turnover, profitability, and productivity.1 Research published by Harvard 
Business Review showed that when employees reported being happy or 
satisfied, their employers saw average increases of 37 percent in sales, 
31 percent in productivity, and 19 percent in accuracy on tasks.2

on firm performance,” LSE Business Review, July 15, 2019.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTFiguring out where to focus resources can be overwhelming 
for leaders balancing competing priorities
The list of things to do when it comes to creating more supportive and inclusive 
work environments may seem infinite. But companies may already offer many of 
the policies and practices surveyed. On average, BLNA women reported that their 
employer offered 29 of the 38 policies and practices. 

With limited time and resources, leaders must focus on the efforts that will have the 
greatest impact—and identifying those interventions is extremely challenging. As a 
diversity and belonging leader at a tech company shared, “Sometimes I feel like we 
have way too much information. You might think that’s a good thing—but we often 
don’t know how to use it. It doesn’t end up meaningfully informing our priorities or 
decision making.” 

Companies should prioritize three key employee needs
BLNA women identified nine cornerstone policies and practices as the ones that were 
most impactful to their ability to join, stay, or advance at their company. These nine 
interventions address three key employee needs: democratizing access to information 
to level the playing field; increasing flexibility by giving employees the choice to work 
the way they work best; and demystifying development by charting clear pathways 
for development and advancement. 

The pages that follow review each key employee need, the policies that companies 
can implement to support it, and why each one matters for BLNA women—and for all 
employees. The result is a road map for companies to develop talent strategies that 
enable all their people to thrive at work.

NINE INTERVENTIONS ADDRESS THREE KEY NEEDS

Social capital, or the connections and relationships we form in both our 
personal and professional lives, provides information and resources 
that can significantly influence our ability to successfully navigate the 
workplace. 

Personal networks made up of family, friends, and others in our immediate 
communities (“people like me”) can connect us to opportunities as well 
as provide information about cultural and organizational norms (such as 
self-promotion or negotiating compensation). But access to this type of 
social capital is not distributed evenly, which can have a direct impact on 
economic outcomes over time for those who are shut out.36 BLNA women 
(and many other underrepresented communities) may have fewer and less-
influential connections because of inequities in education and income, 
which can reduce access to crucial information that other employees may 
be able to leverage.37 

‘When I’m navigating the job application 
process, I don’t have people in my corner to 
help me understand my worth. 

‘My mom may be college educated, but as a 
Black woman looking for work in the 1970s, 
opportunities were limited. Her advice was 
“Be happy you have an offer, and take the 
job.” So I never asked for more. 

‘When you show me the [salary] range, 
you’re empowering me with information.  
At least I know what I should expect.’

B L AC K  WO M A N ,  P R O D U C T  M A N AG E R ,  S TA R T- U P

At work, employees form similar social networks by connecting around shared 
identities and mutual interests, often through casual interactions such as coffee 
chats, happy hours, and team events. Although informal, these interactions are often 
a key source of less “official” organizational knowledge or advice and can also create 
additional opportunities for those who are “in the know.” 

3 6

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTBut BLNA women technologists face double exclusion based on their gender and race 
or ethnicity, which may make it difficult to create the informal social peer networks 
that might provide other employee in-groups with 
key information, resources, or other contacts to help 
them advance within their organization.

A gainst  this  backdrop,  BLNA  women  told  us 
that policies related to democratizing access to 
information  were  among  the  most  impac t ful 
(Exhibit 5). 

‘Access to information is huge for me at work. I have seen 
leaders, people who have influence, present opportunities to 
some of my male counterparts, whether it’s an open role or a big 
project. I’m the only Black female here, so I just don’t have the 
same access to these insider relationships. Tech still feels like 
a boys’ club, but increasing transparency gives everyone a fair 
chance to raise their hand.’

‘When job applicants are coming from an underrepresented 
group with limited access to information and mentorship, 
they need feedback that they’re really not getting. I see job 
interviews as being a lot harder than the actual job at hand. 
Having a mentor would be beneficial.’

06 Give employees the 

option to work remotely, 
hybrid, or on-site.

07 Enable employees to flex their 

working hours—for example, through 
compressed workweeks, alternative 
work schedules, and job sharing. 

Well-designed benefits such as paid sick leave and expanded mental health supports 
provide a critical safety net for all employees. But they can also create particularly 
welcome flexibility to support the needs of systemically underrepresented groups. 
BLNA women face some of the most significant barriers to the social and economic 
resources that can help balance caregiving needs with the demands of a career.38

These types of benefits aren’t just good for workers: paid sick leave can help reduce 
presenteeism (when an employee goes to work despite not feeling well and not in a 
position to be productive) while also improving employee satisfaction and reducing 
turnover.39 But companies need to create cultures that feel psychologically safe and 
encourage employees to make use of these benefits as they see fit.

As one Latina data analyst at a Fortune 500 company shared, 
“Flexible work hours have been majorly important to me. I 
never feel pushed to work when I feel sick. This is a large 
part of the company culture, and each of my managers has 
reinforced the practice.” 

Similarly, companies that support their employees’ mental 
health  see  better  engagement  outcomes  overall—for 
example, workers who felt they had support for their mental 
health were 26 percent less likely to report at least one 
symptom of a mental health condition. They also tended to 
perform better and have higher job satisfaction, intention to 
stay, and more positive views of their company and leaders.40

Mental  health  struggles  can  sometimes  feel  isolating 
and surrounded by stigma, but these conditions are very 
common across all communities: more than 75 percent of 
employees in the United States have struggled with at least 
one issue that affected their mental health in the past.41 This 
is compounded by the fact that BLNA women are more likely 
to face difficulties in getting access to necessary treatment 
and  support  as  a  result  of  misconceptions  and  gaps  in 
screening and diagnosis. 

3 8

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTBLNA women were more likely than other demographics to report high impact from 
policies related to empowering them to work the way they work best (Exhibit 6). 

‘I have really benefited from being a remote worker. A lot of the small talk that happens 
in the workplace centers around a culture that I am not a part of and can’t relate to. Being 
remote, I feel I have more control. I can protect myself from daily microaggressions, which 
are super draining, and can carve out time for what’s most productive and energizing for 
me as an employee.’

OPTIONS SUPPORT EMPLOYEES—NOT HARM THEIR ADVANCEMENT 

BLNA women employees reported that policies and practices that offer them the flexibility to work the way they work best had 
a greater impact than most other employer policies in their ability to join, remain at, or advance at a company. 

At the same time, when implemented without thoughtfulness about a company’s unique circumstances, flexibility programs risk 
stigmatizing or reducing the likelihood of advancement for those who make use of them. For example, employees who work in 
person at the office could benefit from a higher volume of opportunities to develop sponsorship relationships and receive more 
extensive coaching and apprenticeship from colleagues.

Therefore, companies implementing the cornerstone policies and practices around flexibility should take a few additional “value 
assurance” steps to ensure those policies or practices have a positive effect not only on retention but also on advancement:

•  Closely monitor rates of both retention and advancement—as well as overall satisfaction—for employees 
who make use of different types of flexibility programs compared with those who do not (particularly remote 
work and shifted hours). Monitoring on a quarterly basis using a short pulse survey can provide an early 
signal if any shifts are required to ensure the programs are working well and not inadvertently generating 
inequitable outcomes.

•  Hold “hybrid team” trainings with managers on equitable ways to assign stretch projects and to provide 
feedback, coaching, and mentorship to their teams when they are managing some workers in person and 
some who are working remotely.

IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT OFFERING POLICIES; 
IT’S ABOUT INTENTIONAL DESIGN 

The vast majority of companies with significant technical workforces 
already offer paid sick leave benefits. But there is still opportunity to 
improve the design and implementation of these policies to increase 
equity and efficacy. 

As one Latina software engineer at a fintech company shared, “I chose 
my current company in part because of the benefits. But once you’re in 
the job it’s different. I joined less than a year ago, so I’m hustling—I don’t 
feel like I have the time and space to take care of myself. I feel like my 
company could be more proactive about supporting us. Just offering the 
benefits isn’t enough if I’m going to feel like I need to be on all the time.” 

Flip to page 53 to learn about an approach that can help companies 
ensure that their design of these policies and practices is accessible and 
useful for BLNA women.

Research shows that women of color, specifically BLNA women, are significantly 
less likely to have opportunities for advancement and promotion to senior positions. 
According to McKinsey and LeanIn.org’s 2022 Women in the Workplace report, the 
first step up to manager proves a big obstacle to many. For example, assuming equal 
numbers of women and men at entry level, only 75 Latinas are promoted to manager 
for every 100 men. This number is even lower for Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, 
and Indigenous women. Yet this “broken rung” in the ladder is not for lack of ambition. 
The same report found that 40 percent of Latinas and 37 percent of Black women 
want to be top executives, compared with 27 percent of White women.42

Internal processes to evaluate performance and determine who gets promotions, raises, 
and access to opportunities are often affected by bias (which can be unintentional).43 
For BLNA women in technical roles, these biases can have a direct impact on their 
ability to grow professionally. When done well, internal review processes can provide 
clear “step up” opportunities, concrete feedback, and actionable next steps so that 
employees know what they need to do to improve and develop their careers. But 
that’s not the reality for many BLNA women in tech, who tend to report receiving less 
honest and less constructive feedback than White women. 

‘Companies need to help us understand expectations at every 
level. In my experience, that bar for making it to that next 
rung of the ladder is super unclear. Just tell me what I need to 
do so that there aren’t surprises—I think that’s the biggest 
opportunity in terms of making things more equal for us as 
women of color.’

forward—you can ask managers and mentors for help, but 
in my experience, the answer is usually, “Be good at your job

Although the cornerstones may seem basic, only 36 percent of survey respondents 
said their company offered all nine of these supports.44 As a first step, companies 
that don’t currently have these in place should consider implementing them using the 
checklist and best practices included at the end of this chapter.

employees are essential for companies that want to transform the demographics of 
their technical workplaces.

Additionally, given that BLNA women face some of the highest exclusions and 
barriers among demographic groups today, the types of interventions that have the 
most outsize impact for them compared with other groups could also help other 
communities that are underrepresented in the technical workforce. 

Companies are leaving value on the table
Simply having policies and practices doesn’t mean they are as useful as they could be, 
especially for BLNA women. That holds companies back from realizing the potential 
full value from the investments they are already making.

POLICY DESIGN SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR HIDDEN BARRIERS

Many companies may say, ‘Well, we already have these policies and practices,’ and think that 
their work is done. 

But what companies may not see are the hidden barriers that BLNA women are particularly 
likely to face when trying to use them—some of which originate from forces far outside the 
company walls. That prompts a need to carefully design policies and practices to account for 
those barriers. 

All employees come into the workplace with their own set of lived experiences that influence 
how they navigate their role, teams, and company. For me, growing up, my family always told 
me that, because I was a Black woman, I needed to work three times as hard, and always be on, 
to get half as far as my coworkers. 

That means that when I got to the workforce, I felt like I risked others questioning my dedication 
to my role and my work ethic when I took any time off at all. This voice in my head is part of the 
reason why even today, as a CEO, I will absolutely encourage and support my team to take the 
time they need, but I have a hard time taking the time myself. 

That is why it’s so important for companies to go beyond just offering the policy to truly 
and deeply listen to employees. That can help companies understand what pain points 
these policies and practices may be solving, how employees access and use the policies, any 
potential barriers that may exist, and what the company culture may communicate, implicitly or 
otherwise, to employees who choose to use these policies or practices.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTIntentionally designing policies to be accessible is crucial. Only 46 percent of BLNA 
women reported that their employer’s average existing cornerstone policies were 
designed to be accessible and effective for them, 16 percentage points lower than 
what their peers reported. 

Designing policies to reduce barriers to use is a key challenge 
for companies. Across the 38 policies and practices surveyed, 
there was substantial divergence between BLNA women and 
their peers from other demographics in the degree to which 
they found existing employer policies to be accessible. For 
example, BLNA women are 23 percentage points less likely 
than their peers to think that their employer’s current sick 
leave policies were designed with the needs of someone like 
them in mind (Exhibit 8). Clearly, much work is left to do to 
make all policies and practices more equitable and accessible.

at the same rate as other demographic groups. This may be related to the fact that 
they don’t perceive those efforts as being designed to be accessible and effective for 
them. 

Describing why she did not feel that she could take sick days or personal leave, one 
Latina associate principal at a tech consulting company shared the barriers she saw to 
using her company’s existing policies. “People perceive asking for help suggests a lack 
of performance or capability. Asking for help means someone else could be doing the 
job better. If I take time off, I’m weak; I’m less competent.”

Only 32 percent of BLNA women reported using more than half of the policies and 
practices in our full set, compared with 43 percent of all other demographic groups, 
meaning that companies’ investments in these policies and practices are not yet 
achieving their full impact potential (Exhibit 9).

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTWhat’s at stake when companies don’t invest in policies and practices that include 
BLNA  women?  Engaged  talent,  innovative  and  welcoming  workplaces,  and 
employee retention. 

Since the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition launched in 2018, companies have 
demonstrated the motivation, capability, and opportunity to do better—which is why 
the collective power of the coalition has helped create industry-wide change in a 
competitive, fast-moving landscape. 

Companies can build on those gains and transform the technical workforce. The 
research in this report demonstrates how company action positively affects employee 
satisfaction and retention across all demographic groups. 

Companies can help close the gap for BLNA women in the technical workforce. They 
can use data disaggregated by race or ethnicity and gender, be part of the movement 
to implement our cornerstone policies and practices, and relentlessly commit to the 
work of iterating, optimizing, and designing these policies so they work for BLNA 
women today and tomorrow.

Building an inclusive workforce, intentionally, isn’t always easy—and it can’t be done 
alone. That’s why the actions recommended in this report are tactical, well within 
reach, and an efficient place to start amid competing priorities. These tools can give 
companies the resources to move beyond checking a box to truly build inclusive 
cultures where all employees feel that they belong. 

This period in time is marked by uncertainty. But one thing is certain: companies 
can transform the technical workforce experience to the benefit of BLNA women, 
individual companies, and the entire sector. 
When  companies  rise  to  this  challenge, 
the ripple effect is a truly inclusive culture 
underpinned by well-designed and intentional 
policies and practices. This culture has the 
power to reshape representation for BLNA 
women  and  other  communities  that  have 
historically been excluded from the technical 
workforce. It also has the power to reshape 
an industry into one that innovates, disrupts, 
and leads the way. 

Getting this right is a business imperative. 
We have an opportunity to commit to a new 
horizon  and  unleash  the  full  potential  of 
BLNA women’s technical talent.

READY TO TAKE ACTION?  
HERE ARE THREE STEPS YOU CAN TAKE: 

•  Share the report with your colleagues and introduce them to the nine 
cornerstone  policies  and  practices  that  all  companies  committed  to 
investing in the workforce should implement. 

•  Connect  with  the  Reboot  Representation  team  to  discuss 
implementing  the  nine  cornerstone  policies.  If  you’re  ready  to  act, 
we want to partner with you! You can reach out directly to someone

BUSINESS CASE 
Investing in Black, Latina, and 
Native American (BLNA) women 

RETURN ON TALENT INVESTMENT

INNOVATION THROUGH DIVERSITY

Investing in talent may pay off. 
According to research 
published by the McKinsey 
Global Institute based on an 
analysis of 1,800 companies, 
companies that invest in 

human capital “are more consistent and resilient 
performers.”1 For example, from 2019 to 2021, 
People + Performance Winners grew revenue twice 
as fast as Performance-Driven Companies (8 
percent versus 4 percent).

ATTRACT TOP TALENT

Companies committed to 
diversity may be better 
able to attract and retain 
top talent. Seventy-two 
percent of respondents from 
demographic groups other 

than BLNA women reported that their employer’s 
commitment to DEI is important to them.3

Diverse companies tend 
to be more innovative. 
Companies with above-
average diversity 
outperformed competitors 
by 19 percent in terms of 
innovation revenues (products less than three 
years old), on average.2

REDUCE TURNOVER

Employee turnover is 
costly. An employee’s 
departure can cost a 
company approximately 
1.5 to 2.0 times the 
employee’s annual salary 

because resources must shift to recruit, 
onboard, and train someone new (an often 
lengthy and time-consuming process).4 At the 
same time, productivity can suffer while  
the role remains unfilled or as the 
replacement ramps up.

TO GUIDE YOUR 
POLICIES

Organizations can ensure 
their policies and practices are 
accessible and effective—and 
thereby efficient—by making sure 
they are accounting for potential 
pain points across the employee 
life cycle and experience. 

Six key design questions that leaders 
and their teams should consider  
when conceiving of or implementing 
new policies or practices: 

relevant options? 

accessible and easy to use? 

How can we use quantitative and 
qualitative data to identify how pain

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTINTENTIONAL POLICY 
DESIGN IN PRACTICE

The following is an 

example of how  

an organization 

could apply 

the key design 

questions to 

paid sick leave, 

one of the nine 

cornerstone 

policies and 

practices. 

Use quantitative and qualitative data to identify how pain points 
differ for each group:  
• Gather inputs from different types of employees, such as parents, single parents, and 

caregivers of adult dependents (including different gender and racial or ethnic identities) 
through various channels such as listening sessions, focus groups, and anonymous surveys.

• Ask employees about the barriers they see to using or getting the most out of today’s policies, 
as well as what they would like to see in the future. What makes them hesitate to use sick time 
when they need it?

• Make sure to disaggregate data at the intersection of race or ethnicity, gender, and other 

sub-categories to understand how pain points may affect Black, Latina, and Native American 
women differently. (For instance, how might pain points affect a Black senior manager at your 
company who is a single parent?) 

Offer employees multiple relevant options: 
• Offer sick days that can be used in multiple ways, such as “sick hours” to attend medical 

appointments during the workday or sick days to care for a dependent who is ill. 

Ensure all options are accessible and easy to use: 
• Eliminate unnecessary barriers, such as requiring employees to request approval within a 

certain time frame or the requirement to submit a doctor’s note as documentation.

• Be clear about the channels of communication (such as email, Slack, text message, or phone 
call) that are acceptable for notifying supervisors and HR of an absence, and specify what 
information employees need to share.

• Make sure that the policy (and any related instructions or information) is easy to find and that 

there is a single source of truth.

• Give employees access to their sick leave balance so they can keep track without needing to 

reach out to a supervisor or HR.

• If possible, provide a “buddy coverage” system so employees can take a sick day without 

feeling that they’re letting their team down, because their buddy can cover their workload for 
the day.

• Do not set expectations that a sick employee should attend meetings remotely.

5 4

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTINTENTIONAL POLICY 
DESIGN IN PRACTICE

(CONTINUED)

Communicate frequently and clearly about the practice: 
• Communicate with employees about sick leave benefits throughout the year, not just during 

open enrollment (for example, send reminders in the fall around back-to-school time).

• Ensure that communications clearly state what sick leave can and cannot be used for 

(for instance, employee illness or injury, a loved one’s illness or injury, preventive care, or 
caregiving).

• Use various communication channels to reach employees with different preferences, including 
nudges via email, webinars, in-person town halls, corporate intranet, and employee resource 
group events or communications.

Promote a culture that encourages adoption:
• Ensure that teams are supportive of colleagues when they are out by establishing a clear 

plan regarding work responsibilities or assigning buddies to cover certain critical tasks during 
absences.

• Eliminate stigma by encouraging senior leaders and people managers to role model by being 

transparent about their use of these benefits.

• Reward senior leaders and people managers who have consistently strong engagement and/or 

well-being scores (for instance, through pulse checks or employee engagement surveys).

• Train senior leaders and people managers to talk to their teams about why taking time off 
(especially during illness) is a business imperative—such as speeding time to recovery and 
reducing the chance of infecting others.

Continuously measure impact through disaggregated data and 
iterate as needed: 
• Analyze uptake across different segments of the population to identify trends (such as team, 
geography, and employee demographics), and ask employees what is useful about the current 
policy or what continued pain points they are experiencing.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTA ROAD MAP TO ACTION

The policies and practices that Black, Latina, and Native American (BLNA) women report as having the highest 
impact for them today, combined with the pressing need to address hidden barriers to access, point to a clear 
prioritized three-part road map for companies ready to take action.

Leverage disaggregated data
Use data disaggregated simultaneously by race or ethnicity, gender, and role (for example, technical versus 
nontechnical) to build a fact base, identify root causes and areas of opportunity, and measure progress across the 
organization in the following areas:

• Uptake of policies and 

• Interim outcomes (for example, 

practices

• Satisfaction with policies 

and practices

promotions among those who used a 
professional-development program)

• Ultimate outcomes (such as representation and 
lower turnover at each seniority level of the 
organization and for technical-specific roles) 

Review results of disaggregated analyses at least quarterly with senior leaders to plan action steps.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTSCOPE

This report is focused specifically on the needs of Black, Latina, and Native American 
(BLNA) women in the technical workforce. We focused on this population because 
technical jobs are among the fastest growing and highest paying45—yet BLNA women 
continue to be excluded from these roles.

As a result of this dramatic lack of representation, BLNA women in technical roles face 
particularly acute challenges in the workplace and experience greater marginalization. 
We believe that by centering our research (and solutions) on better meeting the needs 
of this population, we can help tech workers of all identities to thrive. 

It is important to recognize that not all BLNA women 
face  the  same  experiences.  Many  women  may 
experience discrimination due to other aspects of 
their identity in addition to their gender or race or 
ethnicity, including sexual orientation or a disability 
(among countless others). 

We hope that by spurring efforts to identify and 
address  the  needs  of  employees  at  the  most 
underrepresented intersection of gender and race 
or ethnicity, we will encourage further research on 
understanding how other forms of intersectionality 
affect experiences within the workplace.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTMETHODOLOGY

Key sources of input
Employee survey
Our employee experience survey canvassed 2,076 employees holding technical roles. 
Survey questions covered multiple themes (for example, policies and practices in place 
to support employees, perception of the policies and practices they both do and do 
not use, and overall sentiment about their employer) as well as demographic questions 
(such as gender, race/ethnicity, age, employment status, and role). The primary focus 
of this survey was to identify the policies and practices that are perceived to be most 
effective and to uncover gaps between companies’ current offerings and BLNA 
women’s specific needs. 

Demographics of our sample
BLNA women in technical roles
• Total respondents: 1,087

• 42 percent in technical roles in the tech sector; 58 percent in technical roles in other 

sectors

• 67 percent employed by small companies; 33 percent by medium-size and large 

companies*

• 58 percent Black/African American women; 32 percent Hispanic/Latina women; 10 

percent Native American/Alaska Native/First Nations women

Other technical employees
•  Total respondents: 989

•  57 percent in technical roles in the tech sector; 43 percent in technical roles in other 

sectors 

• 68 percent employed by small companies; 32 percent by medium-size and large 

companies*  

• 53 percent non-BLNA men; 26 percent non-BLNA women; 20 percent BLNA men**

Our employee experience survey included 38 employee-facing policies and practices 
aimed at attracting and recruiting candidates, as well as retaining and advancing 
employees (see sidebar “Full list of policies and practices included in the survey”). We 
identified this set of policies and practices based on a review of existing literature as 
well as interviews with subject matter experts. All employee experience survey data 
was collected between February 15 and March 9, 2023. 

BLNA women interviews
Between  March  5  and  March  31,  2023,  we  interviewed  BLNA  women  with 
experience in technical roles. Our interviews focused on the workplace experiences 
of individuals to gain a deeper understanding of the quantitative findings from the 
employee experience survey. Within quotations, some identifying details may have 
been removed to protect the speaker’s anonymity. Quotations may have been edited 
for clarity. 

*Small companies defined as 5,000 employees or 
fewer; medium and large companies defined as more 
than 5,000 employees.

**Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rounding.

5 8

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTCompany survey and interviews
This report is based on research on 27 companies across the United States. For the 
purposes of our research, we focused on companies within the technology sector 
whose primary business is selling technology or technological services to consumers 
or businesses, as well as companies outside of that industry that have sizable technical 
workforces. 

HR leaders provided information on DEI priorities as well as the internal policies and 
practices in place within their organizations to recruit, retain, and advance BLNA 
women in technical roles. We defined technical roles as those that are related to 
computing, programming, software development, IT services, data science, and 
engineering, among others. 

Our company survey included 40 internal and employee-facing policies and practices 
aimed at attracting and recruiting candidates, as well as retaining and advancing 
employees. We identified this set of policies and practices based on a review of 
existing literature as well as interviews with subject matter experts. 

All company survey data was collected between February 23 and March 14, 2023. 

Additionally, we conducted interviews with HR and/or DEI practitioners from 12 
companies between March 2 and April 12, 2023. Quotations may have been edited 
for clarity.

SYSTEM UPGRADE: REBOOTING CORPORATE POLICIES FOR IMPACTKey analyses
Employee survey comparative analysis
Many  of  the  analyses  in  this  report  involved  comparative 
analyses, using answers for both BLNA women and the control 
group. All comparative differences stated in this report were 
significant considering a confidence interval at 95 percent. 
Whenever an overall average is presented, it refers to the simple 
average across the 38 policies and practices for each of our 
two population samples. Many of the questions offered a five-
point labeled response scale (for example, “strongly disagree” 
to  “strongly  agree”).  Unless  otherwise  specified,  analyses 
aggregated the top two and bottom two boxes of the response 
scale (for instance, “somewhat agree” and “strongly agree”).

The nine cornerstone policies and practices included in chapter 
four were identified based on what BLNA women ranked as the 
most “impactful.” “Impactful” was determined by calculating 
the percentage of BLNA women who used a given policy or 
practice and ranked it as either “likely substantially impacting” 
their ability to get or accept an offer or stay or advance at their 
organizations, or as “I likely would not have gotten or accepted 
an offer/stayed/advanced without this.”

Technical workforce representation analysis 
The representation of different groups at the intersection of race and ethnicity and 
gender was calculated using data from the Women in the Workplace Experience 
Survey (EES), LeanIn.org and McKinsey, 2018 and 2022. The 2018 EES surveyed 
more than 64,000 employees from 81 companies. The 2022 EES surveyed more than 
40,000 respondents from 55 companies. 

This is a different data source than the BLS-driven workforce numbers for BLNA 
women used to cover an earlier time period in the 2018 Rebooting Representation 
report.

Additional key definitions
Across analyses, the report sometimes refers to percent changes and sometimes 
to differences in percentage points. Percent changes measure the rate of change 
between two percentages. Percentage point differences measure the arithmetic 
difference between the two percentages. 

When looking at computing degree graduates, the report considers Integrated 
Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) coding of CIP 11 first and second 
majors. When looking at the US working population, the report considers the 
population aged 18 to 64 from the US Census Bureau. When looking at the US 
college-aged population, the report considers the population aged 15 to 34 from the 
US Census Bureau.

“ Impactful” was determined by calculating the percentage of BLNA 
women who used a given policy or practice and ranked it as either 
“likely substantially impacting” their ability to get or accept an offer/
stay/advance at their organizations, or as “I likely would not have 
gotten or accepted an offer/stayed/advanced without this.” Please see 
“Scope and methodology” for additional details.

8  Across both BLNA women and all other demographic groups.

9  Throughout this report, insights are expressed as percent changes or 
differences in percentage points. Percent changes measure rate of 
change between two percentages. For example, if representation of 
women over 50 in tech went from 10 percent to 20 percent, there was 
a 100 percent increase in representation. Percentage point differences 
measure the arithmetic difference between the two percentages. For 
example, if 10 percent of women over 50 in tech were excited to be 
senior leaders, but 20 percent of women under 30 in tech were excited 
to be senior leaders, women under 30 in tech were 10 percentage 
points more likely to be excited to be senior leaders. Note: all data in the 
aforementioned example is illustrative.
