Insights across trends

Despite challenging overall market conditions in 
2023, continuing investments in frontier technologies 
promise substantial future growth in enterprise adoption. 
Generative AI (gen AI) has been a standout trend since 
2022, with the extraordinary uptick in interest and 
investment in this technology unlocking innovative 
possibilities across interconnected trends such as 
robotics and immersive reality. While the macroeconomic 
environment with elevated interest rates has affected 
equity capital investment and hiring, underlying 
indicators—including optimism, innovation, and longer-
term talent needs—reflect a positive long-term trajectory 
in the 15 technology trends we analyzed. 

These are among the findings in the latest McKinsey 
Technology Trends Outlook, in which the McKinsey 
Technology Council identified the most significant 
technology trends unfolding today (to know more about 
the Council, see the sidebar “About the McKinsey 
Technology Council”). This research is intended to help 
executives plan ahead by developing an understanding 
of potential use cases, sources of value, adoption drivers, 
and the critical skills needed to bring these opportunities 
to fruition. 

Our analysis examines quantitative measures of 
interest, innovation, investment, and talent to gauge the 
momentum of each trend. Recognizing the long-term 
nature and interdependence of these trends, we also 
delve into the underlying technologies, uncertainties, 
and questions surrounding each trend. (For more about 
new developments in our research, please see the 
sidebar “What’s new in this year’s analysis” on page 9; for 
more about the research itself, please see the sidebar 
“Research methodology” on pages 10–11.)

New and notable

The two trends that stood out in 2023 were gen AI and 
electrification and renewables. Gen AI has seen a spike 
of almost 700 percent in Google searches from 2022 
to 2023, along with a notable jump in job postings and 
investments. The pace of technology innovation has 
been remarkable. Over the course of 2023 and 2024, 
the size of the prompts that large language models 
(LLMs) can process, known as “context windows,” spiked 
from 100,000 to two million tokens. This is roughly the 
difference between adding one research paper to a 
model prompt and adding about 20 novels to it. And the 
modalities that gen AI can process have continued to 
increase, from text summarization and image generation 
to advanced capabilities in video, images, audio, and text. 
This has catalyzed a surge in investments and innovation 
aimed at advancing more powerful and efficient 
computing systems.

The large foundation models that power generative 
AI, such as LLMs, are being integrated into various 
enterprise software tools and are also being employed 
for diverse purposes such as powering customer-facing 
chatbots, generating ad campaigns, accelerating 
drug discovery, and more. We expect this expansion 
to continue, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. 
Senior leaders’ awareness of gen AI innovation has 
increased interest, investment, and innovation in 
AI technologies and other trends, such as robotics, 
which is a new addition to our trends analysis this year. 
Advancements in AI are ushering in a new era of more 
capable robots, spurring greater innovation and a wider 
range of deployments.

Electrification and renewables was the other 
trend that bucked the economic headwinds, 
posting the highest investment and interest 
scores among all the trends we evaluated. 
Job postings for this sector also showed a 
modest increase. 

Although many trends faced declines in 
investment and hiring in 2023, the long-term 
outlook remains positive. This optimism is 
supported by the continued longer-term 
growth in job postings for the analyzed 
trends (up 8 percent from 2021 to 2023) 
and enterprises’ continued innovation and 
heightened interest in harnessing these 
technologies, particularly for future growth. 

In 2023, technology equity investments 
fell by 30 to 40 percent to approximately 
$570 billion due to rising financing costs 
and a cautious near-term growth outlook, 
prompting investors to favor technologies 
with strong revenue and margin potential. 
This approach aligns with the strategic 
perspective leading companies are 
adopting, in which they recognize that 
fully adopting and scaling cutting-edge 
technologies is a long-term endeavor. This 
recognition is evident when companies 
diversify their investments across a 
portfolio of several technologies, selectively 
intensifying their focus on areas most likely 
to push technological boundaries forward. 
While many technologies have maintained 
cautious investment profiles over the past 
year, gen AI saw a sevenfold increase 
in investments, driven by substantial 
advancements in text, image, and video 
generation. 

Despite an overall downturn in private 
equity investment, the pace of innovation 
has not slowed. Innovation has accelerated 
in the three trends that are part of the “AI 
revolution” group: generative AI, applied AI, 
and industrializing machine learning. Gen 
AI creates new content from unstructured 
data (such as text and images), applied 
AI leverages machine learning models 
for analytical and predictive tasks, and 
industrializing machine learning accelerates 
and derisks the development of machine 

learning solutions. Applied AI and 
industrializing machine learning, boosted by 
the widening interest in gen AI, have seen 
the most significant uptick in innovation, 
reflected in the surge in publications and 
patents from 2022 to 2023. Meanwhile, 
electrification and renewable-energy 
technologies continue to capture high 
interest, reflected in news mentions and 
web searches. Their popularity is fueled 
by a surge in global renewable capacity, 
their crucial roles in global decarbonization 
efforts, and heightened energy security 
needs amid geopolitical tensions and  
energy crises.

The talent environment largely echoed the 
investment picture in tech trends in 2023. 
The technology sector faced significant 
layoffs, particularly among large technology 
companies, with job postings related to  
the tech trends we studied declining by  
26 percent—a steeper drop than the  
17 percent decrease in global job postings 
overall. The greater decline in demand for 
tech-trends-related talent may have been 
fueled by technology companies’ cost 
reduction efforts amid decreasing revenue 
growth projections. Despite this reduction, 
the trends with robust investment and 
innovation, such as generative AI, not only 
maintained but also increased their job 
postings, reflecting a strong demand for 
new and advanced skills. Electrification and 
renewables was the other trend that saw 
positive job growth, partially due to public 
sector support for infrastructure spending. 

Even with the short-term vicissitudes in 
talent demand, our analysis of 4.3 million 
job postings across our 15 tech trends 
underscored a wide skills gap. Compared 
with the global average, fewer than half of 
potential candidates have the high-demand 
tech skills specified in job postings. Despite 
the year-on-year decreases for job postings 
in many trends from 2022 to 2023, the 
number of tech-related job postings in 2023 
still represented an 8 percent increase from 
2021, suggesting the potential for longer-
term growth (Exhibit 1).

Enterprise technology 
adoption momentum 

The trajectory of enterprise technology adoption 
is often described as an S-curve that traces the 
following pattern: technical innovation and exploration, 
experimenting with the technology, initial pilots in 
the business, scaling the impact throughout the 
business, and eventual fully scaled adoption (Exhibit 
2). This pattern is evident in this year’s survey analysis 
of enterprise adoption conducted across our 15 
technologies. Adoption levels vary across different 
industries and company sizes, as does the perceived 
progress toward adoption.

We see that the technologies in the S-curve’s early 
stages of innovation and experimenting are either 
on the leading edge of progress, such as quantum 
technologies and robotics, or are more relevant to 
a specific set of industries, such as bioengineering 

and space. Factors that could affect the adoption of 
these technologies include high costs, specialized 
applications, and balancing the breadth of technology 
investments against focusing on a select few that may 
offer substantial first-mover advantages. 

As technologies gain traction and move beyond 
experimenting, adoption rates start accelerating, and 
companies invest more in piloting and scaling. We see 
this shift in a number of trends, such as next-generation 
software development and electrification. Gen AI’s rapid 
advancement leads among trends analyzed, with about 
a quarter of respondents self-reporting that they are 
scaling its use. More mature technologies, like cloud  
and edge computing and advanced connectivity, 
continued their rapid pace of adoption, serving 
as enablers for the adoption of other emerging 
technologies as well (Exhibit 3).

1Respondents may interpret these categories differently based on their organizations. As such, the results should be considered as indicative of organizations’ 
self-assessments, rather than precise measurements. 2For a deeper look at our AI-related trends, see “The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes 
and starts to generate value,” McKinsey, May 30, 2024.

McKinsey & Company

The process of scaling technology adoption also 
requires a conducive external ecosystem where user 
trust and readiness, business model economics, 
regulatory environments, and talent availability play 
crucial roles. Since these ecosystem factors vary by 
geography and industry, we see different adoption 
scenarios playing out. For instance, while the leading 
banks in Latin America are on par with their North 
American counterparts in deploying gen AI use cases, 
the adoption of robotics in manufacturing sectors varies 
significantly due to differing labor costs affecting the 
business case for automation. 

As executives navigate these complexities, they 
should align their long-term technology adoption 
strategies with both their internal capacities and 

the external ecosystem conditions to ensure the 
successful integration of new technologies into 
their business models. Executives should monitor 
ecosystem conditions that can affect their prioritized 
use cases to make decisions about the appropriate 
investment levels while navigating uncertainties and 
budgetary constraints on the way to full adoption (see 
the “Adoption developments across the globe” sections 
within each trend that showcase examples of adoption 
dimensions for the trends or particular use cases therein 
that executives should monitor). Across the board, 
leaders who take a long-term view—building up their 
talent, testing and learning where impact can be found, 
and reimagining the businesses for the future—can 
potentially break out ahead of the pack.

The 15 tech trends

This report lays out considerations for all 15 technology 
trends. For easier consideration of related trends, 
we grouped them into five broader categories: the AI 
revolution, building the digital future, compute and 
connectivity frontiers, cutting-edge engineering, and a 
sustainable world. Of course, there’s significant power 
and potential in looking across these groupings when 
considering trend combinations. 

To describe the state of each trend, we developed scores 
for innovation (based on patents and research) and 
interest (based on news and web searches). We also 
sized investments in relevant technologies and rated 
their level of adoption by organizations (Exhibit 4). 

What’s new in this year’s analysis

This year, we reflected the shifts in the 
technology landscape with two changes on the 
list of trends: digital trust and cybersecurity 
(integrating what we had previously described 
as Web3 and trust architectures) and the future 
of robotics. Robotics technologies’ synergy 
with AI is paving the way for groundbreaking 
innovations and operational shifts across the 
economic and workforce landscapes. We also 
deployed a survey to measure adoption levels 
across trends.

Exhibit 4

Each trend is scored based on its level of innovation, interest, investment, 
and adoption.

To assess the development of each technology trend, our team collected data on five tangible 
measures of activity: search engine queries, news publications, patents, research publications, 
and investment. For each measure, we used a defined set of data sources to find occurrences of 
keywords associated with each of the 15 trends, screened those occurrences for valid mentions 
of activity, and indexed the resulting numbers of mentions on a 0–1 scoring scale that is relative 
to the trends studied. The innovation score combines the patents and research scores; the 
interest score combines the news and search scores. (While we recognize that an interest 
score can be inflated by deliberate efforts to stimulate news and search activity, we believe that 
each score fairly reflects the extent of discussion and debate about a given trend.) Investment 
measures the flows of funding from the capital markets into companies linked with the trend. 

Data sources for the scores include the following:

 — Patents. Data on patent filings are sourced from Google Patents, where the data highlight 

the number of granted patents.

 — Research. Data on research publications are sourced from Lens.

 — News. Data on news publications are sourced from Factiva.

 — Searches. Data on search engine queries are sourced from Google Trends.

 — Investment. Data on private-market and public-market capital raises (venture capital and 

corporate and strategic M&A, including joint ventures), private equity (including buyouts and 
private investment in public equity), and public investments (including IPOs) are sourced from 
PitchBook.

 — Talent demand. Number of job postings is sourced from McKinsey’s proprietary 

Organizational Data Platform, which stores licensed, de-identified data on professional 
profiles and job postings. Data are drawn primarily from English-speaking countries.

In addition, we updated the selection and definition of trends from last year’s report to reflect 
the evolution of technology trends:

 — The future of robotics trend was added since last year’s publication.

 — Data sources and keywords were updated. For data on the future of space technologies 

investments, we used research from McKinsey’s Aerospace & Defense Practice.

Research methodology 
(continued)

Finally, we used survey data to calculate the enterprise-wide adoption scores for each trend:

 — Survey scope. The survey included approximately 1,000 respondents from 50 countries.

 — Geographical coverage. Survey representation was balanced across Africa, Asia, Europe, 

Latin America, the Middle East, and North America.

 — Company size. Size categories, based on annual revenue, included small companies 

($10 million to $50 million), medium-size companies ($50 million to $1 billion), and large 
companies (greater than $1 billion).

 — Respondent profile. The survey was targeted to senior-level professionals knowledgeable 

in technology, who reported their perception of the extent to which their organizations were 
using the technologies.

 — Survey method. The survey was conducted online to enhance reach and accessibility.

 — Question types. The survey employed multiple-choice and open-ended questions for 

comprehensive insights.

 — Definition of enterprise-wide adoption scores:

•  1: Frontier innovation. This technology is still nascent, with few organizations investing in or 

applying it. It is largely untested and unproven in a business context.

•  2: Experimentation. Organizations are testing the functionality and viability of the 

technology with a small-scale prototype, typically done without a strong focus on a near-
term ROI. Few companies are scaling or have fully scaled the technology.

•  3: Piloting. Organizations are implementing the technology for the first few business use 
cases. It may be used in pilot projects or limited deployments to test its feasibility and 
effectiveness.

•  4: Scaling. Organizations are in the process of scaling the deployment and adoption of the 
technology across the enterprise. The technology is being scaled by a significant number 
of companies.

•  5: Fully scaled. Organizations have fully deployed and integrated the technology across 

the enterprise. It has become the standard and is being used at a large scale as companies 
have recognized the value and benefits of the technology.

Generative AI

The trend—and why it matters

Generative AI (gen AI) has been making significant strides, 
pushing the boundaries of machine capabilities. Gen AI models 
are trained on vast, diverse data sets. They take unstructured 
data, such as text, as inputs and produce unique outputs—also 
in the form of unstructured data—ranging from text and code to 
images, music, and 3D models. 

Over the past year, we’ve seen remarkable advancements in 
this field, with text generation models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, 
Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini producing content that 
mimics human-generated responses, as well as with image-
generation tools such as DALL-E 3 and Midjourney creating 
photorealistic images from text descriptions. OpenAI’s recent 
launch of Sora, a text-to-video generator, further showcases 
the technology’s potential. Even music composition is being 

revolutionized, with models such as Suno creating original pieces  
in various styles. 

Gen AI has sparked widespread interest, with individuals and 
organizations across different regions and industries exploring its 
potential. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on the 
state of AI, 65 percent of respondents say their organizations are 
regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from 
one-third last year,1 and gen AI use cases have the potential to 
generate an annual value of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion.2  

However, it’s important to recognize the risks that accompany the 
use of this powerful technology, including bias, misinformation, and 
deepfakes. As we progress through 2024 and beyond, we anticipate 
organizations investing in the risk mitigation, operating model, 
talent, and technological capabilities required to scale gen AI.

Latest developments

 — LLMs are increasingly being embedded into various 

enterprise tools. We are witnessing a significant uptick 
in the integration of LLMs into various enterprise 
tools. This surge is fueled by the growing demand for 
automation, efficiency, personalized user experiences, 
and the capacity to decipher complex patterns that 
can lead to actionable insights. Consequently, a rising 
number of vendors are choosing to integrate LLMs into 
their applications and tools. This trend is especially 
prominent in the marketing and customer care domains, 
with Salesforce Einstein and ServiceNow serving as 
prime examples.

 — The multiagent approach has gained significant traction 
with the rapid development of LLMs and continued 
innovation. Companies now recognize the benefits 
of employing multiple language models that work in 
harmony rather than relying on a single model. This 
approach offers a fresh perspective on tackling complex 
challenges by leveraging the capabilities of multiple AI 
agents, each specializing in different domains, to solve 
a single problem collaboratively. By working together, 
these agents can not only accelerate problem-solving 
but also leverage varied perspectives and expertise to 
deliver more effective and efficient solutions. Some  
of the tools using this approach tend to be unstable,  
but as models improve, their throughput should 
significantly increase, making them increasingly  
relevant for the future.

Gen AI is a fast-growing and constantly innovating trend, 
with recent developments including the following: 

 — Multimodal generative models are on the rise. As 

gen AI continues to evolve and gain more attention in 
various industries, it’s becoming increasingly clear that 
multimodality will play a pivotal role. By combining text, 
images, sounds, and videos, AI models can generate 
outputs applicable across a wide range of industries 
and business functions. This pursuit of multimodality 
is intensifying across leading players such as OpenAI 
and Google (with its Lumiere AI web app). For example, 
Google’s Gemini showcases a powerful multimodal 
system capable of processing information in various 
formats, including text, code, tables, images, and  
even audio. 

 — Powerful open-source models are challenging their 
closed-source counterparts in performance and 
developer adoption. While significant investments 
are encouraging the development of proprietary large 
language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 with vision 
(GPT-4V), the AI community is also witnessing a surge in 
open-source models, such as Llama 3. This momentum 
is fueled by the enthusiasm of developers and users  
who welcome the unprecedented access to build 
innovative tools and study complex systems. The 
accessibility of open-source models is attracting a 
growing developer base.

 — The context window in natural-language processing 

(NLP) is expanding. This expansion allows for longer and 
smarter prompts. For instance, in early 2024, Google 
released the largest context window in the market with 
Gemini 1.5 Pro, which has a standard context window of 
128,000 tokens, with the potential to reach two million 
tokens.3 This larger context window enables the model 
to generate more coherent and contextually relevant 
responses by considering a larger amount of text. 
However, expanding prompt size can paradoxically lead 
to models getting “lost in the middle,” as they tend to 
focus on specific parts of the text while avoiding the rest.

Adoption developments across the globe

Gen AI emerges as a front-runner in the trends landscape, 
sharing the top spot with electrification and renewables 
for the highest percentage of respondents scaling its 
implementation. This underscores its significance as a 
pivotal, high-growth trend to closely monitor throughout  
the year.

Many companies have made progress throughout the year 
on adopting gen AI and are currently working on scaling 
it across their businesses. While gen AI adoption has 
surged across various sectors, the technology, media, and 
telecommunications sector has notably emerged as a leader 
in the deployment of the technology. 

The lack of availability of local language support poses 
challenges to adoption globally. Some countries, including 
India, Japan, and countries in the Middle East, have pushed 
to develop their own LLMs. In Africa, the prioritization of 
data locality and proximity hampers the building of LLMs. 

Significant progress has been made recently with the 
emergence of multilingual models. Multilingual capabilities 
could become essential for any LLM, with the primary focus 
shifting to the degree of localization, including the use of 
slang, technical terms, and other nuances.

Adoption dimensions
The adoption trajectory of advanced technologies varies for 
each technology and each use case within that technology. 
Advancements along the following dimensions could enable 
reaching the next level of adoption for gen AI:

 — a clearly defined ROI for widespread horizontal and 

vertical use cases by sector, along with a demonstrated 
ability to control risks and ensure safety with the 
development and deployment of new AI solutions

 — decreased computational costs, alongside improvement 
in overall AI efficiencies (for example, improving latency) 

‘Since gen AI captured public attention at the end of 
2022, a significant amount of focus has been placed on 
delivering value through foundation models. Many are 
already demonstrating cross-industry value, such as 
coding acceleration or sales and marketing use cases, 
as well as domain-specific models, such as protein 
engineering or chemistry discovery foundation models. 
The field continues to improve quickly with new tools—
for example, multimodal, agent-based models. Companies 
should concentrate on building capabilities in this domain 
and prioritize areas of focus to ensure they capture early 
value and aren’t left behind.’

In real life 

Real-world examples involving the use of gen AI include  
the following:

 — ING, a global financial institution, leveraged gen AI to 

enhance customer service in the Netherlands, one of its 
key markets.4 While the current classic chatbot usually 
resolves 40 to 45 percent of those chats, that leaves 
another 16,500 customers a week who need to speak 
with a live agent for help. Recognizing gen AI’s potential, 
ING developed a bespoke customer-facing chatbot to 
provide immediate, tailored assistance. This resulted 
in helping 20 percent more customers avoid long wait 
times and offering instant gratification in the first seven 
weeks of use compared with the previous solution. The 
chatbot is expected to reach 37 million customers as it 
expands across ten markets.

 — Recursion, a biotech company, has developed a new 
gen AI platform and trained an LLM to accelerate 
drug discovery. This platform enables scientists to 
simultaneously access multiple machine learning 
models that can process large amounts of proprietary 
biological and chemical data sets to save time during 
drug development.

 — Itaú Unibanco, Latin America’s largest private sector 
bank, created ad campaigns dedicated to women 
football athletes using AI.5 The campaign highlighted 
a 1941 Brazilian law that banned women from playing 
football. It used AI-generated images from conversations 
with real players and historians, among others, to create 
the “Brazilian teams that have never existed” campaign, 
paving the way for a new generation of AI-based media 
advertising. 

 — Nubank is piloting a gen AI virtual assistant to boost 
customer service.6 The virtual assistant focuses on 
delivering personalized credit-related options within 
the Nubank ecosystem. It helps customers understand 
their credit card usage, explore collateralized credit 
opportunities, and use its online payment service NuPay 

without affecting their credit limits. Additionally, it may 
offer personal loans based on the customer’s profile 
and eligibility. For the initial phase, this innovative 
solution will be available exclusively to members of 
NuCommunity, Nubank’s customer engagement 
platform. The assistant, developed using GPT-4 and 
Nubank’s proprietary tools, was designed to evolve and 
improve through continuous customer interactions, 
ensuring a dynamic, customer-focused service.

Underlying technologies

Multiple types of software and hardware power gen AI 
across the entire tech stack. These include the following:

 — Application layer. Typically, this is the interface that the 

end user interacts with (for example, chat).

 — Integration/tooling layer. Sitting between the application 
layer and foundation model, this layer integrates with 
other systems to retrieve information, filter responses, 
save inputs and outputs, distribute work, and enable 
new features. Examples include the large-language-
programming framework LangChain and vector 
databases such as Pinecone and Weaviate.  

 — Foundation models. These are deep learning models 
trained on vast quantities of unstructured, unlabeled 
data that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the 
box or adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning.

 — Digital infrastructure. This involves using the digital 
abstraction of physical infrastructure to support 
data storage, processing, and computation. Digital 
abstraction includes databases (for example, SQL and 
NoSQL) and core tech services (for example, compute, 
storage, and networking). 

 — Physical infrastructure. This encompasses hardware that 
enables computational, data storage, and networking 
needs, including data centers, AI accelerator chips, 
and data center mechanical, electrical, and plumbing 
technologies.

Key uncertainties 

The major uncertainties affecting gen AI include the 
following:

 — Will enterprise adoption experience the same level 
of exponential growth and monetization as seen in 
consumer adoption?

 — Cybersecurity and privacy concerns are prevalent, 

 — How will the market develop in terms of open-source 

notably regarding data leakage risks and vulnerabilities 
(including customer and protected data). 

 — Ethical considerations surround the responsible use of 
gen AI, including data governance, justice and fairness, 
accountability, and explainability.

 — Regulation and compliance might affect research into 

gen AI and its potential applications.

solutions versus closed-source?

 — How should companies approach gen-AI-related risks, 
including data privacy and security, equity, fairness, 
compliance, and copyright protections?

 — What strategies should policy makers adopt to address 
the risk of social engineering from third-party LLM 
solutions?

 — Copyright ownership and protection of content 
generated by open-source models remains an 
unanswered question.

 — When will error rates and avoidance of hallucinations get 
to an acceptable level for large-scale implementations of 
gen AI in everyday use cases?

 — Environmental impact may increase as training models 
expend exponentially more computational resources. 

 — Which workers will see their roles shift due to gen AI, and 

to what extent will they be affected?

 — Inaccuracies are the most recognized and experienced 
risk for gen AI uses,7 and they can affect use cases 
across the gen AI value chain. 

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with gen AI:

 — How will the cost of model creation evolve, and how will it 

affect competitive dynamics?

 — As technological advancements such as gen AI models, 
accelerators, and throughput continue to evolve, what 
are the primary use cases that companies should 
prioritize, and how should they position themselves for 
future relevance in terms of their degree of involvement, 
whether as shapers, takers, or makers?

‘Gen AI is currently at the exciting nexus of demonstrated 
proof of value, rapid innovation, significant public and private 
investment, and widespread consumer interest. The year 2023 
was the year of pilots, and, moving forward, we can expect 
to see two important areas of focus to accelerate adoption 
and value creation: one is a rapid expansion of modular and 
secure enterprise platforms that will serve as the foundation 
for developing gen AI applications, and two, a focus on the 
reskilling and rewiring of processes required in a business 
domain to drive user adoption and capture value.’

Applied AI

The trend—and why it matters

As we navigate through 2024, the impact of analytical AI 
technologies, including applications of machine learning (ML), 
computer vision, and natural-language processing (NLP), 
continues to grow across all sectors. Companies are using data 
to derive insights to automate processes, transform businesses, 
and make better decisions. McKinsey research estimates that 
AI applications can potentially unlock an economic value of $11 
trillion to $18 trillion annually.1  The excitement around generative 
AI (gen AI) has led to increasing awareness of the potential value 
of applied AI. In our recent global survey on the state of AI in 2024, 
67 percent of respondents say they expect their organizations to 
invest more in AI over the next three years.2 The survey highlights 
that organizations continue to see returns from AI efforts across 
business domains. Regulators and policy makers alike are 

also taking note of AI’s increasing impact, with the European 
Parliament, for example, passing the unified EU Artificial 
Intelligence Act.3  

However, the journey to AI adoption is filled with challenges 
and learning opportunities, such as transforming organizational 
culture to foster collaboration, trust, and adaptation to new 
ways of working; acquiring, leveraging, and organizing valuable 
sources of large data sets; and interpreting model outputs to build 
end-user trust in them. Leaders should anticipate challenges 
such as governance conflicts across the entire business—given 
the cross-domain nature of AI—and the rapid evolution of the 
regulatory and ethical landscape. Despite these challenges, 
establishing protocols and guardrails, along with effective change 
management, can help mitigate risks and ensure the successful 
incorporation of AI into business operations.

Latest developments

Recent developments involving applied AI include the 
following:

 — The emphasis on data-centric AI is growing. Rich, high-

quality data sets are essential assets for capturing value 
from AI. The shift toward data-centric AI represents a 
significant evolution in the field, as capabilities such 
as picking the right model or hyperparameter tuning 
become more automated and easier to use. Data-centric 
AI use cases are diverse and widespread, but specific 
examples include financial institutions using it to detect 
and prevent fraudulent activities, healthcare providers 
promoting transparency in AI-driven diagnoses, or 
manufacturers identifying potential biases in quality 
control systems. A company’s unique data can be 
used to train AI models to automate and optimize core 
processes and unlock new business potential. Having 
access to unique data sets can provide a distinct 
competitive advantage, which explains why companies 
such as OpenAI are actively seeking new data and 
purchasing exclusive rights. 

As companies build their own private AI environments, 
the scope of data governance will expand beyond 
privacy to address interconnected threats such as data 
poisoning (for example, tampering with the training 
data) and model hijacking (for instance, taking control 
of an existing model and manipulating it to perform 
unauthorized tasks). This transition requires robust data 
practices, including maintaining data quality, tracing 
data lineage, and employing explainable AI to foster trust 
and reduce bias. 

 — Hardware acceleration has gained significant 

momentum in applied AI. The continuous increase 
in the scale and complexity of deep learning models 

has surpassed the abilities of conventional central 
processing units, accelerating hardware development. 
To train these large models and operate them in real 
time, organizations are shifting toward specialized 
hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs), 
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-
specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and high-bandwidth 
memory (HBM) chips. Originally designed for graphics, 
GPUs now provide the parallel processing power 
needed for AI tasks. FPGAs offer adaptability for 
custom solutions at the edge, while ASICs offer top-
tier performance and efficiency for specific tasks. As 
the complexity of AI increases, the search for faster, 
more efficient hardware persists. By leveraging the 
capabilities of specialized hardware, organizations can 
spearhead the forthcoming wave of AI innovation.

 — Generative AI (gen AI) opens the door to more applied 
AI. Gen AI adoption is not only increasing among 
curious individuals but also catalyzing increased 
adoption of applied AI. We see organizations getting the 
most impact from gen AI when they intertwine it with 
applied AI use cases. For instance, a digital-marketing 
company is using gen AI to create a variety of unique 
and engaging content for its customers. However, the 
real magic happens when its applied AI systems analyze 
the performance of the generated content, identifying 
patterns and trends in user engagement. This data 
is then used to inform the gen AI system, generating 
insights to produce more effective content in the future. 
In this way, gen AI is being informed by real-world 
data and feedback. The synergy between gen AI and 
applied AI is what truly unlocks the potential of both 
technologies.

‘The prominence of generative AI has opened the aperture 
for business leaders to explore applied AI, which could 
have as much or greater business impact.’

Adoption developments across the globe

Applied AI tools are widely adopted across industries and 
regions, driven by advancements in AI capabilities and an 
increase in use cases. Most companies adopt applied AI 
technologies to increase revenue—for example, through 
integration with existing offerings or completely new 
product and revenue streams.

The technology, media, and telecommunications and 
financial-services sectors have emerged as leaders in the 
adoption of applied AI tools. Some of these companies are 
also the makers and innovators of the technology itself. 
Across industries, including financial and professional 
services, energy and materials, and consumer goods, 
companies also have made significant investments in 
applied AI tools. 

Adoption dimensions
The adoption trajectory for advanced technologies will 
look different for each technology and each use case 
within that technology. Advancements along the following 
dimensions could enable the next level of adoption for 
applied AI:

 — improved availability of plug-and-play solutions 
to allow seamless integration into existing IT and 
cloud infrastructure, combining standardized and 
interoperable industrialized ML with gen AI capabilities 
for a broader range of industry use cases and clear ROI

 — effective change management to foster continuous 
learning and knowledge sharing through training, 
best-practice dissemination, and role modeling to drive 
effective organizational adoption of AI technologies

 — robust implementation of ML-operations (MLOps) 
and large-language-model-operations (LLMOps) 
practices to ensure optimal performance of AI 
models in production environments (for more, see the 
“Industrializing machine learning” trend), enabling 
seamless scalability and sustained performance 
from minimum-viable products to enterprise-wide 
deployment

 — improved data organization, availability, and 

governance across organizations to enable AI  
use cases

In real life 

Real-world examples involving the use of applied AI 
include the following:

 — Saudi Aramco has built an AI hub to efficiently 

analyze more than five billion data points per day 
from wellheads in the oil and gas fields, enhancing 
the understanding of petro-physical properties and 
expediting decision making in exploration and drilling. 
The solutions provide real-time alerts to prevent 
business disruption, improve reservoir performance, 
and save millions of dollars by optimizing field 
development plans and well trajectories. AI technology 
is also used to predict and prevent drilling challenges, 
such as stuck pipes, and to monitor the health of 
essential equipment, such as steam traps, using 
infrared images.4  

‘Applied AI has been transforming the way we work for 
some time now. Gen AI takes this to a new level, allowing 
organizations to tackle end-to-end workflows that were 
previously too complex to go after. This is possible 
with gen AI’s powerful off-the-shelf models that are 
complemented by data-centric approaches. As we apply 
these technologies, organizations need to emphasize the 
integral human part of these workflows, ensuring that 
these solutions are built for end users, by end users.’

 — Deep reinforcement learning. This type of ML uses 

efficient processing and analysis of extensive medical 
records, encompassing both traditional and electronic 
health records. Tailored for life insurance underwriters, 
this solution simplifies the navigation of complex and 
voluminous medical documents by extracting and 
organizing critical information.5 

 — Vistra Corp, the largest competitive power producer 
in the United States, committed to a 60 percent 
emissions reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions 
by 2050.6 Among several emissions reduction 
initiatives, Vistra wanted to understand how AI might 
help it run its power plants more efficiently. The 
company used a multilayered neural network model, 
trained on two years of plant data, to determine 
optimal plant operations—for example, set points 
in the control room to achieve maximum heat-rate 
efficiency for any combination of external factors, 
such as temperature and humidity. Once power 
engineering experts validated the models, they began 
to provide recommendations to operators every 30 
minutes to enhance the plant’s heat-rate efficiency, 
helping operators meet energy targets and improve 
plant reliability. This led to a 30 percent decrease 
in duct burner usage, annual fuel savings of about 
$175,000, and reduced carbon emissions, ensuring 
more efficient, more reliable power. The insights were 
incorporated into a solution named the Heat Rate 
Optimizer (HRO), which was implemented across the 
company’s entire fleet, yielding $23 million in savings. 
Vistra has since extended the HRO to 67 additional 
power generation units across 26 plants.7

Industrializing machine learning

The trend—and why it matters

Industrializing machine learning (ML), also known as 
machine learning operations (MLOps), is the process of 
scaling and maintaining ML applications within enterprises. 
As we progress through 2024, MLOps tools are rapidly 
evolving, improving in both functionality and interoperability. 
These tools are facilitating the transition from pilot projects 
to robust business processes, enabling the scaling of 
analytics solutions, and enhancing team productivity. 
Successful industrialization of ML can help sustain solutions, 
reduce the production timeline for ML applications by eight 

to ten times, and decrease development resources by 
up to 40 percent.1 Initially introduced by a few pioneering 
companies, MLOps is becoming more widely adopted 
as more companies use AI for a broader spectrum of 
applications. The rise of generative AI (gen AI) has reshaped 
the AI landscape, demanding a corresponding upgrade in 
MLOps capabilities to service its unique demands. This is 
the newest field for novel developments in the industrializing 
ML trend. MLOps and foundation model operations (FMOps) 
are essential for industrializing and scaling gen AI safely  
and efficiently.

Latest developments

Recent developments involving industrializing ML include 
the following:

 — Monitoring and orchestration are becoming crucial 

components of MLOps. This is particularly evident in 
the complex task of upgrading enterprise technology 
architecture to integrate and manage models and 
orchestrate interaction between ML models and other 
applications and data sources. Several integration 
patterns are emerging, including those that allow 
models to call APIs in response to user queries. 
Recent advancements in integration and orchestration 
frameworks, such as LangChain and LlamaIndex, 
have greatly facilitated these developments. To 
effectively integrate these models, it’s essential for 
MLOps pipelines to incorporate specific performance 
measurement tools. For instance, they need to assess 
a model’s ability to retrieve the correct information. 
Companies such as Fiddler and Databricks are actively 
investing in this field. They offer performance tracking, 
validation, and orchestration, enabling companies to 
monitor their live operations effectively. This ensures  
the smooth facilitation of their ML applications,  
further emphasizing the importance of monitoring  
and orchestration in the successful implementation  
of MLOps.

 — The use of prebuilt solutions and APIs is on the rise. In 
recent years, there has been a significant surge in the 
availability of machine learning APIs and preconfigured 

solutions, partly due to the explosive growth of gen 
AI. Accessed predominantly through APIs, gen AI 
technologies—encompassing advanced tools such 
as computer vision libraries and pretrained image 
recognition models—have profoundly reshaped the ML 
development landscape. As these APIs gain popularity 
and continue to evolve, they are progressively assuming 
responsibilities that were once the purview of ML 
engineers, such as data preprocessing and model 
training on predefined data sets. As gen AI continues 
to evolve, its impact on the field is expected to expand, 
making it a pivotal driver of industrializing  
ML technologies.

 — MLOps is important to gen AI from the get-go. It is 
increasingly recognized that gen AI, including large 
language models, should not be viewed as separate from 
the ML ecosystem. Instead, there is a call to broaden 
the scope of MLOps to incorporate gen AI. MLOps is 
crucial in developing, deploying, and maintaining gen 
AI solutions, allowing ML algorithms to be dispatched 
quickly and effectively. By standardizing processes, 
enabling version control and tracking, and integrating 
shared metrics and monitoring, MLOps breaks down 
organizational silos and fosters close collaboration 
between data scientists, ML engineers, and operations 
teams and thus is pivotal in the end-to-end life cycle  
of gen AI.

‘The past several years have yielded huge advances in the 
mathematics of machine learning, but the tasks of making 
that math really useful have lagged. MLOps—the way that the 
math gets made useful—is finally catching up. The tools and 
processes are beginning to mature, but we still need additional 
talent and skills to reap the benefits of machine learning.’

making the technology more broadly accessible and 
understood by nontechnical employees 

In real life

Real-world examples involving industrializing ML include the 
following: 

 — Meta uses HawkEye internally to gain a comprehensive 

understanding of its ML workflows.2 HawkEye 
functions as a real-time monitor, anomaly detector, and 
analyst for potential issues, from data quality to model 
performance. It also ensures end-to-end observability 
through tracing of ML pipelines, integration with 
explainable AI, and the provision of debugging tools.

 — MLflow, an open-source platform aimed at streamlining 
ML development, is adding generative AI–centered 
capabilities. For example, its prompt engineering 
user interface provides an opportunity to try out 
multiple large language models (LLMs), parameter 
configurations, and prompts.3 

‘Solving for gaps in automated monitoring and life cycle 
management of deployed AI solutions will ensure the lasting 
and scalable impact of AI. That includes continued focus on 
gen AI: industrializing bespoke gen AI solutions will require 
robust gen AI operational ecosystems, and we see more options 
emerging for processing unstructured data, engineering and 
operating LLM flows, and automating the gen AI solutions 
life cycle. Continued progress on enablement of regulatory 
and ethical alignment and explainability will help unlock new 
areas of AI impact.’

Next-generation software development

The trend—and why it matters

The landscape of software development is currently experiencing 
a transformative shift, driven by an influx of cutting-edge 
technologies such as generative AI (gen AI) and cloud-native 
architectures. The year 2023 saw a significant rise in AI-powered 
tools, building on previous years’ advancements in software 
development and DevOps automation (for example, continuous 
integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure as code, and 
improved integrated development environments). These 
innovations are revolutionizing how engineers operate throughout 
the entire software development life cycle (SDLC), from planning 
and testing to deployment and maintenance. These technological 
breakthroughs are not only enhancing the capabilities of 
engineers but also opening doors for less technical professionals 
to participate in application development as complex tasks are 
simplified and accelerated. 

While the path to wide-scale adoption may take more time—
because of obstacles such as integration challenges, lack of 
clear measurement metrics for developer productivity, and need 
for large-scale retraining of developers and test engineers—an 
increase in the adoption of AI-powered software development 
tools is promising. Early adopters are already experiencing 
productivity boosts, laying the groundwork for more widespread 
adoption in the near future. This year promises even more 
groundbreaking possibilities as maturing technologies like user-
friendly low-code platforms, AI assistants throughout the SDLC, 
integration with gen-AI-enabled product management tools, and 
scalable cloud architectures converge, leading to democratized 
development, hyperefficiency, and exceptional adaptability.

Latest developments

Recent developments involving next-generation software 
development include the following:

 — New versions of AI-powered development tools are 
transitioning from proof of concept to wide-scale 
application. The software development industry 
has witnessed a significant turning point in the past 
year with the release of new versions of advanced 
AI-powered tools that are transforming the landscape. 
Unlike their static and off-the-shelf predecessors, 
these new versions have moved beyond the proof-
of-concept phase and now offer a higher degree of 
adaptability and customization, catering to the specific 
needs of individual projects. This shift is resulting in a 
wider application of these tools. For instance, Tabnine, 
an AI-powered auto-completion tool, has improved its 
ability to understand the context of developers’ code, 
leading to more accurate and relevant code completions. 
Developers can now create and share custom code 
templates within Tabnine, allowing them to automate 
repetitive tasks specific to their projects or coding style, 
thereby increasing the tool’s applicability on a larger 
scale.1 

 — There is a growing trend toward more integrated 
development platforms. Companies are moving 
away from a multitude of disparate tools and, instead, 
adopting a smaller number of robust or better-integrated 
solutions that offer a wide range of functionalities 
throughout the development life cycle. This shift 
provides several advantages, including streamlined 
workflows that lead to improved collaboration, reduced 
context switching, and enhanced data visibility. 

However, catering to diverse use cases within the 
organization requires a careful selection of tools with 
robust capabilities and flexibility.

 — The talent landscape will undergo changes. The 

availability of advanced underlying technologies, such as 
gen AI, is enabling software engineers to reallocate their 
time from tasks such as pure code generation to tasks 
such as architecture design and problem solving. This 
change is not only causing a strong mindset shift among 
engineers but also influencing how companies approach 
talent selection, upskilling, and onboarding. The focus 
is no longer solely on the coding skills of potential 
candidates. Instead, companies are investing in defining 
a differentiated upskilling strategy to retain and develop 
talent and are now also assessing how effectively 
candidates can utilize and adapt to these advanced tools 
in their day-to-day tasks. 

 — The focus on compliance and trust is increasing. The 
software development industry is experiencing a 
significant shift toward compliance and trust in response 
to growing concerns about legal and security risks 
associated with software tools. This past year has seen 
growing attention to compliance-focused tools like 
SonarQube, which provide features like code tagging, 
labeling, and detection to improve transparency and 
accountability. Developers are also choosing tools with 
guaranteed indemnity to mitigate potential legal risks 
associated with code generated or analyzed by the tool. 
By prioritizing compliance and safety, the industry can 
improve the quality and reliability of their software while 
also reducing the risk of legal and security issues.

‘These new-generation tools are now guaranteeing indemnity 
for use, with the ability to detect, tag, and label code. This 
metadata will make generated code easier to track and 
manage. The future of tooling is likely to see consolidation 
over time, with companies opting for several comprehensive 
tools or tool chains instead of numerous specialized ones.’

Adoption developments across the globe

In real life 

Real-world examples involving the use of next-generation 
software development include the following:

 — Citi leverages the Harness Continuous Delivery platform 
to provide an integrated experience across all stages 
of software delivery, with a user base of over 20,000 
engineers. The platform brings together all the tools and 
services involved in software delivery with the aim of 
improving performance, consistency, and maintenance 
across the enterprise while operating in the unique 
regulatory and risk management environment that 
comes with financial services. The platform helps 
streamline software delivery, automating deployment, 
testing, and change management after code approval. 
It facilitates faster rollbacks and integrates with 
observability tools for proactive issue detection and 
auto-rollback if needed. This translates into increased 
developer and operations control, reduced manual 
effort, and enhanced security.3

 — Goldman Sachs is exploring the use of gen AI tools to 
assist its software developers in writing and testing 
code. The tools can automatically generate lines of code, 
freeing developers from repetitive tasks and allowing 
them to focus on core functionalities and client needs.

The financial-services and technology, media, and 
telecommunications sectors have emerged as leaders in 
the adoption of next-generation software development. 
Investments are driven by the changing compliance 
landscape and the availability of more customizable tools. 

Adoption dimensions
From nascent to mainstream, the adoption trajectory will 
look different for each technology and even each use 
case within that technology. As AI-generated code—the 
most recent innovation within next-generation software 
development—becomes a standard way of working in the 
software development cycle, it provides an interesting 
example of how the adoption trajectory could develop. 

Advancements along the following dimensions could enable 
the next level of adoption:

 — clear and measurable ROI of AI-generated code tools 
(for example, an increase of more than 25 percent in 
developer productivity for high-complexity tasks)2 

 — a legal framework for liability of AI-generated code 

outcomes to create transparency on who bears the risk 
in case of malfunctions 

 — an increase in the applicability of AI-generated tools that 
can provide sufficient performance for most common 
software development use cases

 — implementation of AI-generated code as part of the 

core curriculum and upskilling programs for software 
developers

‘Next-generation software development tools are 
fundamentally changing the role of developers, freeing up 
capacity for improved experiences and architectures, and 
ultimately, greater value creation.’

Underlying technologies

The technologies that power next-generation software 
development include the following:

 — AI-generated code. AI applications can go beyond code 
suggestions and recommendations and also enable 
users to generate entire functions, optimize existing 
code, create boilerplate code, and adapt to different 
programming languages.

 — Low- and no-code platforms. Software development 
systems, such as Microsoft Power Apps and Google 
AppSheet, make it easier for nondevelopers to build 
applications more quickly.

 — Infrastructure as code. This is the process of configuring 
infrastructure, such as a data center, with machine-
readable code, which enables rapid reconfiguration and 
version control. The cloud, for example, is based on the 
concept of infrastructure that is fully abstracted as code.

 — Microservices and APIs. These are self-contained, 

independently deployable pieces of code that can be 
coupled to form larger applications.

 — AI-based testing. Next-generation software can use AI 
to automate unit and performance testing to reduce the 
amount of time developers spend on this task.

 — Automated code review. These applications use AI  
or predefined rules that enable users to check  
source code.

Key uncertainties

The major uncertainties affecting next-generation software 
development include the following:

 — Relying on automated testing and reviews without 

having humans check the work can lead to increased 
errors in software and erosion of user trust.

 — The growth in the use of low- and no-code tools by 

 — Comprehensive monitoring and version control could 
become more difficult due to uncoordinated changes 
and upgrades from multiple vendors.

 — Quality and security remain concerns with code 

generated by AI pair programmers, particularly if they 
are not regularly updated with the latest standards or are 
not trained on clean, fast code.

 — Addressing intellectual property, legal liability, and 

potential regulations surrounding gen-AI-generated 
code is essential for responsible development and 
deployment.

 — APIs add an extra layer of potential security 

vulnerabilities that can be exploited, and their 
customization can be a challenging task requiring 
substantial time and effort.

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with next-generation 
software development:

 — To what extent will the development of AI-generated 

code affect the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities, as 
well as number, of software engineers?

 — To what extent might no-code tech used by amateur 

developers reduce the demand for fully trained software 
development professionals?

 — From a cultural standpoint, will teams—both developers 
and nondevelopers—embrace or resist changes in ways 
of working? 

 — What intellectual property issues might affect 

AI-generated code?

 — To what extent will business units take responsibility for 
the health of applications, or will accountability continue 
to rest with a shared IT function?

nondevelopers could be limited because experienced 
developers are needed to monitor and debug

Digital trust and cybersecurity

The trend—and why it matters

Digital trust and cybersecurity enable organizations to manage 
technology and data risks, accelerate innovation, and protect 
assets. Moreover, building trust in data and technology 
governance can enhance organizational performance and improve 
customer relationships. In this trend, we include technologies that 
enhance trust (for instance, digital identity and privacy-enhancing 
technologies), cybersecurity capabilities (such as identity and 
access management), and Web3 (such as blockchain). 

The importance of digital trust and cybersecurity is increasing 
as organizations adopt emerging and maturing technologies 

within their enterprises (for example, cloud and edge computing, 
applied AI, and next-generation software development).1 While 
the adoption of these emerging technologies comes with exciting 
new benefits, it also exposes organizations to cybersecurity and 
other risks, increasing the need for digital-trust technologies. The 
adoption of digital trust and cybersecurity, however, has been 
affected by a range of factors, including integration challenges, 
organizational silos, talent shortages, and its limited consideration 
as a critical component of value propositions. Capturing the full 
benefit of digital trust and cybersecurity will require top-down 
leadership and deliberate changes to multiple spheres of activity, 
from strategy and technology to enterprise capabilities.

Scoring the trend
The digital trust and cybersecurity market has 
experienced high growth over the recent years: the 
cybersecurity market growth rate in 2021 was 12.4 
percent.¹  But, as with other trends affected by the 
macroeconomic slowdown, the digital trust and 
cybersecurity trend took a hit in 2023, compared with 
2022, across dimensions such as investment and 
talent demand. That said, the five-year view (2019–23) 
shows robust growth across all dimensions, and as the 
digitization of enterprises continues, this trend is likely 
to keep gaining traction.

Latest developments

Recent developments involving digital trust and 
cybersecurity include the following:

 — Managing generative AI risk and readiness has become a 
key focus. The rise of generative AI (gen AI) has sparked 
innovation across industries while also heightening the 
focus on managing its associated risks. Key concerns 
include fairness and bias, as gen AI can perpetuate 
existing biases embedded in training data. To counter 
these concerns, companies like IBM are creating 
fairness tool kits to identify and remove bias within AI 
models during the development process. Privacy issues 
arise as a result of gen AI’s ability to create deepfakes, 
prompting research into watermarking AI-generated 
content. The potential misuse of gen AI for cyberattacks 
underscores the importance of robust AI security 
frameworks. Intellectual property (IP) rights over gen 
AI’s creative output remain unclear, and challenges 
around the explainability of gen AI’s outputs hinder trust. 
President Biden’s executive order on gen AI, calling 
for research into these risks and the development of 
trustworthy AI standards, and the recently adopted  
EU AI Act create pressure for responsible deployment 
and will likely lead to the adoption of new tools, such as  
those coming from emerging players like Credo AI  
and Holistic AI.

 — Cybercriminals and threats are evolving at a rapid rate. 
Threat actors, including cybercriminals and state-
sponsored groups, are becoming more sophisticated. 
Their attacks exploit new vulnerabilities (for example, 
intricate ransomware that is debilitating power grids) 
and aim for maximum disruption (for example, targeting 
industrial control systems). Unfortunately, current 
security systems and company readiness are often 
not at the level needed to deal with this increased 
cybersecurity risk.

 — New buyers are emerging outside of the CISO role. 

Responsibility for cybersecurity is expanding beyond the 
office of the chief information security officer (CISO), with 
cyber spend now increasingly coming from nonsecurity 
business functions such as product and engineering.2  
Consequently, cybersecurity providers must adapt 
their strategies to use cases with a wide range of 
stakeholders, including and stretching beyond the CISO 
office. Improving cybersecurity maturity, increasing 
efficiency, and possibly increasing the use of AI-enabled 
automation remain key growth drivers.

 — The ongoing debate between cybersecurity platforms 
and best-of-breed solutions is evolving. Cybersecurity 
platforms offer a unified environment, simplifying 
management but potentially compromising on 
functionality. Conversely, best-of-breed solutions offer 
specialized tools but can struggle with data integration 
and user experience. We see a shift as the lines 
between platforms and best-of-breed solutions are 
blurring, with platforms becoming more modular and 
integrating best-in-class security tools. The market is at 
an inflection point in the “best of breed” versus “best of 
suite” debate: customers have not reached a consensus 
on a preference in any segment. Smaller companies 
might favor the simplicity of platforms, while larger ones 
may value the customization offered by best-of-breed 
solutions. The best path lies in balancing comprehensive 
security with manageable complexity while considering 
the company’s security maturity, IT staff skills, and 
growth prospects.

 — Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are sparking mainstream 

interest. After a period marked by regulatory challenges 
for crypto exchanges, multiple Bitcoin exchange-
traded funds (ETFs) have been approved. This has 
effectively lowered the entry barrier, opening up the 
world of cryptocurrencies to a wider audience. In 
addition to Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs are also gaining 
traction. Several Ethereum ETFs are currently awaiting 
approval, indicating a growing interest in diversifying 
cryptocurrency investments. While these developments 
have significantly influenced the digital-asset market, it 
remains volatile.

 — Blockchain companies are moving from piloting to 
at-scale deployment of tokenized financial assets. 
Tokenization, the process of creating a unique digital 
representation of an asset on a blockchain network, 
has started to scale after many years of promise 
and experimentation. The benefits—including 
programmability, composability, and enhanced 
transparency—can empower financial institutions to 
capture operational efficiencies, increase liquidity, and 
create new revenue opportunities through innovative 
use cases. However, as infrastructure players pivot away 
from proofs of concept to robust at-scale solutions, 
many opportunities and challenges remain to reimagine 
the future of financial services. 

2  A recent McKinsey survey on cyber market customers (n = 200) asked respondents, “In your best estimation, how much of your cybersecurity spend comes 

from outside of your CISO organization? Where does that non-CISO cyber spend come from?”

Adoption developments across the globe

 — improved government and public perception of the 

The digital trust and cybersecurity trend has seen 
high adoption levels among our trends, with some 
subcomponents achieving widespread use, while others 
remain at the forefront of innovation, such as emerging 
Web3 applications. About 30 percent of survey respondents 
reported that they had either fully scaled or were scaling 
digital trust and cybersecurity, and more than 60 percent 
mentioned they had invested in it. Financial-services 
companies, in particular, have adopted this trend, driven by 
a need to combat an increasing range of threats and meet 
regulatory requirements.  

Telecommunications, media, and technology companies 
are also at the forefront of adopting digital trust and 
cybersecurity. This is likely because they are leading the way 
in enhancing security measures, particularly in the realm of 
AI, and developing effective tools to address the constantly 
evolving threat landscape.

Companies of any size need to consider how to optimize 
their defenses as cyberthreats and regulatory and customer 
pressures increase.

Adoption dimensions
The adoption trajectory for advanced technologies 
varies for each technology and each use case within that 
technology. Advancements along the following dimensions 
could enable the next level of adoption for digital-trust and 
cybersecurity technologies:

 — new digital identity systems integrated and scaled into 

existing personal-identification processes 

 — enhanced integration of advanced technologies into 

existing cybersecurity frameworks, including upgrading 
midmarket companies’ defenses

 — strong protection mechanisms to ensure user privacy 

and control of personal data 

benefits and risks of digital identities 

 — security capabilities to meet varying regulatory 

requirements, ensuring compliance and fostering trust 

 — innovative applications with tangible real-world 

implications for Web3 to continue expansion beyond 
decentralized finance as practical applications emerge 
across various sectors—for example, the decentralized 
physical infrastructure network (DePIN), still in its early 
stages, which aims to enable cell phones to function on a 
decentralized network

In real life  

Real-world examples involving the use of digital trust and 
cybersecurity include the following:

 — Salesforce built its Einstein Trust Layer specifically to 
address security concerns about using large language 
models (LLMs) within the Salesforce platform. This 
innovative system acts as a secure intermediary for 
Salesforce users interacting with LLMs. The Einstein 
Trust Layer ensures data confidentiality and privacy by 
masking personally identifiable information (PII) before 
it is used as input for the LLM and by adhering to a zero-
retention architecture, meaning none of the Salesforce 
data is stored outside the platform or used to train 
the LLM itself. Additionally, the Trust Layer monitors 
outputs for inappropriate content and streamlines 
communication between the user and the LLM.

 — Cisco created a customer-facing trust portal called 

the Cisco Trust Portal. This self-service tool provides 
customers with on-demand access to a wide range of 
documents related to security, trust, data protection, and 
privacy compliance. The purpose of the Trust Portal is to 
assist customers in gaining a deeper understanding of 
Cisco’s security measures and evaluating the security of 
its offerings.

‘Digital-trust technologies are the cornerstone of value 
creation in the age of gen AI. By embedding robust 
security, privacy, and ethical frameworks into AI systems, 
organizations not only protect their assets but also build 
a foundation of trust that drives innovation, enhances 
customer loyalty, and unlocks new opportunities for 
sustainable growth.’ 

– Liz Grennan, partner, Stamford

 — Skyflow offers a platform called the Skyflow Data 

Underlying technologies

Privacy Vault, designed to help companies manage, 
protect, and utilize sensitive data while ensuring 
compliance and privacy.3 It acts as a secure central hub 
for sensitive data, isolating it from other systems and 
encrypting it with advanced techniques. Despite strong 
security, Skyflow’s secure APIs still allow users to utilize 
this data for workflows, sharing, or analysis—all without 
ever decrypting the original information.

 — Franklin Templeton launched the Franklin OnChain 
U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX), the first 
US-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain 
to process transactions and record share ownership. 
Toward the end of March 2024, it had exceeded 
$330 million in assets under management. The fund 
is primarily issued on the Stellar public blockchain 
and Polygon. Franklin Templeton has also announced 
plans to issue tokens on other blockchains, including 
Avalanche and Aptos.4

 — French banking giant Société Générale completed its 
first tokenized green-bond issuance on the Ethereum 
network, reflecting the growing interest in real-
world-asset tokenization among traditional financial 
institutions. The bank’s digital-asset-focused division, 
SG-FORGE, registered the issuance of digital green-
bond tokens valued at €10 million ($10.8 million). 
These security tokens were purchased by two major 
institutional investors, AXA Investment Managers and 
Generali Investments, through a private placement.

 — Citibank has developed a token service using blockchain 

technology to offer digital-asset solutions for its 
institutional clients.5 The new service, called Citi Token 
Services, converts clients’ deposits into digital tokens, 
facilitating immediate cross-border payments, liquidity, 
and automated trade finance solutions around the 
clock at virtually no cost. As an integral part of the 
bank’s Treasury & Trade Solutions, Citi Token Services 
aims to integrate these tokenized deposits into Citi’s 
global network, thereby strengthening its core cash 
management and trade finance functions.

Digital-trust and cybersecurity technologies include the 
following:

 — Zero-trust architecture. This IT security design concept 
assumes an organization’s network is compromised by 
default and, therefore, enforces access decisions for 
every interaction with every entity.

 — Digital identity. An identity consists of all the digital 
information that characterizes and distinguishes an 
individual or an entity. With self-sovereign identity, 
users control which identifying information to share 
and with whom. Passwordless identity allows users to 
verify and authenticate themselves not with traditional 
alphanumeric passwords but with alternatives such as 
biometrics, devices and applications, and documents. 
Businesses are developing “converged identity” 
solutions, which bring together different dimensions of 
identity into a single platform, enabling, for example, 
continuity as a person shifts from employee to business 
partner to customer. 

 — Privacy engineering. This practice governs the 

implementation, operations, and maintenance of privacy 
by design. It focuses on the strategic reduction of 
privacy risks, enabling purposeful decision making about 
resource allocation and effective implementation of 
privacy controls in information systems.

 — Explainable AI. This AI model covers methods and 
approaches that increase the transparency and 
interpretability of the inputs, weightings, and reasoning 
of machine learning algorithms, thus enhancing trust and 
confidence in them.

 — Technology resilience. Technology resilience is the sum 
of practices and technical foundations necessary to 
architect, deploy, and operate technology safely across 
an enterprise environment. It includes components such 
as immutable backup and self-healing networks. Such 
capabilities help organizations identify and overcome 
challenges such as latency, outages, or compromise 
and have the dual goal of reducing the likelihood of 
technology risk events and enabling faster recovery if a 
technology risk event does occur.

‘In a world where information is digital, connected, 
and widely accessible, cybersecurity forms the very 
bedrock of trust through which competitive advantage 
can be accelerated. But it must be designed, built, and 
implemented in the right way to realize the benefits.’ 

– Justin Greis, partner, Chicago 

 — Blockchain. This is a digitally distributed, decentralized 
ledger that exists across a computer network and 
facilitates the recording of transactions.

 — Smart contracts. Established in immutable code on a 

blockchain, these software programs are automatically 
executed when specified conditions (such as terms 
agreed on by a buyer and seller) are met.

cybersecurity regulations necessitate changes to local 
company policies. 

 — Tensions between privacy and fairness or privacy and

risk. Organizations should adopt comprehensive and 
adaptive cybersecurity strategies to mitigate these 
risks and ensure resilience when navigating geopolitical 
uncertainty.

 — Decentralized applications. These applications operate 
on peer-to-peer networks, removing dependence 
on centralized servers. They leverage blockchain 
technology for data storage and security, often utilizing 
cryptocurrencies for transactions and user engagement.

Key uncertainties 

The major uncertainties affecting digital trust and 
cybersecurity include the following:

 — Implementation complexity is significant, given resource 
requirements, talent scarcity, inadequate funding, lack 
of shared taxonomies and aligned risk frameworks, 
coordination challenges across multiple parties, and 
required shifts in organizational norms and practices 
needed to achieve effective deployments.

 — Compatibility challenges will be encountered when 

updating or migrating technologies and integrating them 
with legacy systems or with an abundance of fragmented 
point solutions.

 — Lack of standardization and widely accepted best 
practices for how or when to use trust architecture 
techniques across industries will continue to be 
a challenge. Additionally, differences in national 

 — Regulatory landscapes for blockchain and tokenization 
remain fragmented and under development across 
various jurisdictions, posing significant challenges for 
compliance. While some regions have begun to establish 
comprehensive frameworks, such as the EU’s Markets in 
Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, the United States and 
other countries are still navigating through legislative 
processes with bills like the Blockchain Regulatory 
Certainty Act. Therefore, it is wise to continuously 
monitor these evolving regulations to adapt and ensure 
compliance.6 

 — The path to explainability is unclear. There is no one-
size-fits-all approach to open up the black box of 
large AI models to provide meaningful explanation for 
outputs. These need to be tailored to context and data. 
However, more efficient tooling and new approaches to 
explainability create hope for future improvement.

 — Businesses have doubts about data usage. Many 

companies are worried about their confidential data 
being used to train LLMs, leading to data and IP leakage. 
This can cause them to default to more expensive 
solutions requiring in-house training. Meanwhile, to 
alleviate these fears, vendors are offering stronger 
commitments to data protection, and some are offering 
various forms of indemnity against IP claims.

 — Many executive leaders are beginning to recognize the 
importance of integrating digital-trust measures (such 
as security, resiliency, explainability, and privacy) as core 
product functionality that should be considered from 
the start of a product life cycle. This lack of prioritization 
at the inception of AI-powered products can be driven 
by the perception of ROI on these measures, with 
doubts raised by concern that measures could lower 
value creation (or increase the erosion of value). On the 
other hand, some leaders are finding that investment in 
trust accelerates adoption and value capture and, thus, 
increases ROI.

 — The value proposition and user experience of Web3 
compared with incumbent systems (which are also 
continuing to evolve) are often not fully understood. Even 
as platforms such as Reddit and Discord are beginning 
to experiment with Web3 solutions, the benefits remain 
unclear to many consumers and enterprises.7

point for regulators, especially amid recent failures 
of several nascent Web3 projects and fraud at major

 — How will regulators reconcile past standards governing 

data privacy, data permanency, and other issues with the 
capabilities and requirements of new trust technologies? 
How can regulators be increasingly proactive in a rapidly 
evolving threat and technology landscape filled with 
complexity? 

 — How can companies manage the costs of reporting with 
regulators increasing the expectations for proactive 
cybersecurity risk management?

 — What are the most critical systems and data types, 

and where are organizations typically exposed to risk? 
How can organizations be comfortable that they are 
sufficiently protected in line with the organization’s risk 
appetite, especially as the attack surface is expanding, 
data is flowing out to many cloud surfaces, and the use 
of contract workers is becoming more prevalent?

 — How can organizations embed leading concepts such as 
“zero trust” into all developments in their digital-portfolio 
architecture to future-proof security? 

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with digital trust and 
cybersecurity:

 — How do organizations manage higher customer, 

employee, and community expectations for security, 

 — Which Web3 business models and value chains 
will emerge as technically reliable, scalable, and 
commercially viable? What will unlock mainstream 
adoption?

 — How will Web3 ecosystems coexist and interconnect 
with today’s enterprise system architectures and 
hyperscaled Web2 platforms? 

‘Tokenization enhances transparency, composability, and 
programmability, enabling financial institutions to improve 
operational efficiencies, increase market liquidity, and create 
new revenue opportunities. Tokenized financial assets issued 
on blockchain are advancing from pilots to live, at-scale 
deployments, emphasizing the need for companies to advance 
their capabilities to stay ahead. Rising user awareness and 
investor demand will further accelerate this trend.’

The trend—and why it matters

Advanced-connectivity technologies can potentially 
revolutionize the experiences of consumers and industries 
such as mobility, manufacturing, and agriculture. 
Organizations have been widely adopting proven 
technologies to enhance their connectivity infrastructure, 
but they have been more hesitant to invest in some of the 
latest connectivity technologies because of unclear ROI. 

However, with cutting-edge technology—such as the latest 
generation of satellite connectivity, private 5G networks, 
and eventually 6G—progressing rapidly, telcos and other 
enterprises must prepare to reap the full benefits of these 
innovations. An increasingly connected world will require 
businesses to think through their strategies, investments, 
and business models to identify and unlock new growth 
opportunities.

Latest developments

Recent developments involving advanced connectivity 
include the following:

 — Telecommunications industry struggles continue. The 
telecom industry faces ongoing pressure to invest 
in 5G despite seeing limited gains in incremental 
revenues from the technology.1 These players continue 
to forge partnerships with next-generation technology 
companies, such as satellite connectivity providers, in 
hopes of driving innovation within their industry and 
overcoming their financial challenges. 

 — Adoption of private networks progresses. Private-

network adoption, specifically with 5G, has increased, 
with industries such as manufacturing, oil and gas, 
and mining seeking out the potential latency and 
security benefits. While the pace of adoption is modest, 
enterprises are beginning to pilot and subsequently 
implement this technology, with telecom players, OEMs, 
and cloud providers also building out the supporting 
infrastructure. 

 — 6G continues to develop, but some questions remain. 
Progress is being made through research with public–
private partnerships, regulatory preparation, and 
standardization, but there are outstanding questions 
about the road to monetization and adoption. It is still 
unclear whether the value added by 6G to certain 
applications will outweigh the associated costs and 
whether telecom companies will be able to successfully 
monetize this new innovation. In any case, securing 

external investments, critical infrastructure, and the 
right talent mix will be essential to navigating toward a 
6G future. Another source of uncertainty is that adoption 
speed will largely depend on spectrum cost and sharing 
regulation.

 — Adoption of xRAN in mobile networks is emerging. In 
2023, large partnerships formed to build out radio-
access-networks (xRAN) infrastructure. The technology 
makes use of the development of xRAN—that is, open 
interfaces (oRAN), virtualization of network functions 
(vRAN), and centralization of control (cRAN)—to 
enhance the flexibility and interoperability in the design 
and operation of wireless networks.3 Both vRAN 
and oRAN enable a potential shift away from tightly 
integrated hardware and software components from 
single vendors to open interfaces and standardization 
of components, increasing flexibility to select services 
from a wider range of vendors.

 — Deployment of LEO satellite constellations is advancing. 
Low-Earth orbit (LEO) is the orbit range for satellites 
that is closest to Earth. LEO satellite constellations offer 
wide-area coverage with significantly reduced latency 
compared with existing satellite offerings. They can be 
used to provide coverage in remote areas, as well as to 
provide connectivity for mission-critical applications. 
SpaceX-owned Starlink currently has more than 6,000 
satellites and aims to expand their fleet to tens of 
thousands of satellites.4

‘Transforming the technology architecture of networks to 
unlock cloud-like scalability, enable [generative] AI and its 
business impact, and drive platform capabilities will be crucial 
for connectivity players. On that journey, new ways to monetize 
will emerge—for example, through 5G stand-alone and network 
APIs—which will be important to pave the way for the next 
generation of RAN and broadband.’

Adoption developments across the globe

Advanced connectivity is one of the top five most adopted 
trends and is driven by the growth of technologies such 
as the Internet of Things (IoT), which rely on advanced-
connectivity capabilities. 

Outside of the technology, media, and telecommunications 
sector, financial-services and energy and materials 
companies have emerged as leaders in the adoption of 
advanced-connectivity tools, with many companies in 
these industries reporting that they are scaling or fully 
implementing the technology.

Adoption dimensions
The adoption trajectory of advanced technologies, such as 
5G private networks, varies for each technology and each 
use case within that technology. Advancements along the 
following dimensions could enable reaching the next level  
of adoption:

 — additional software applications to promote 

interoperability with existing enterprise infrastructure 
(for example, digital twins leveraging 5G capabilities)

 — clarification of spectrum licensing regulation to advance 
adoption for bands reserved for private networks in 
high-traffic areas

 — reduction in installation costs and proliferation of 5G 

end points to allow small and medium-size enterprises to 
implement the technology feasibly

 — enterprise-level holistic vision of all the use cases that 
require 5G over other connectivity technologies (such 
as Wi-Fi), along with investment in scaling the use cases 
with demonstrated proof of concept

In real life 

Real-world examples involving advanced connectivity 
include the following:

 — In January 2024, AT&T, Google, and Vodafone were 

involved in a strategic $155 million investment in AST 
SpaceMobile. The investment is intended to fund a 
“direct-to-smartphone connectivity constellation” that 
will allow wireless users to stay connected outside of cell 
tower coverage.5  

 — Verizon partnered with Allegiant Stadium, host of 

2024’s Super Bowl, to provide private 5G networks for 

coach-to-coach communications and 5G nodes for 
spectators. The company estimated that about half 
of the approximately 61,000 spectators were Verizon 
customers. They used 52 terabytes of data, up  
10 percent from the prior year.6  

 — AT&T announced that it will begin deploying oRAN in 
collaboration with Ericsson, aiming at a commercial-
scale deployment of the technology to increase the 
interoperability of its infrastructure. AT&T plans to spend 
approximately $14 billion over the five-year contract with 
Ericsson, with 70 percent of its wireless network traffic 
to pass over open platforms by 2026.7  

Underlying technologies

The noteworthy technologies in advanced connectivity 
include the following:

 — Optical fiber. Physical strands of glass provide the most 
reliable high-throughput, low-latency connectivity.

 — Low-power wide area networks. These wireless 

networks (for example, narrowband IoT, LoRa, and 
Sigfox) can cover large areas more efficiently while being 
energy efficient at the end points, focused particularly 
on providing connectivity for Internet of Things. 

 — Wi-Fi 6 and 7. Next-generation Wi-Fi offers higher 

throughput, more controllable quality of service, and a 
cellular-like level of security.

 — 5G and 6G cellular. These next-generation cellular 
technologies provide high-bandwidth, low-latency 
connectivity services with access to higher-spectrum 
frequency bands capable of handling a massive 
amount of connected end points, as well as low-power 
connectivity suitable for IoT.

 — High-altitude platform systems (HAPS). These are radio 
stations located at a fixed point 20 to 50 kilometers 
above Earth. HAPS can be deployed on lightweight 
aircraft to provide flexible capacity and access in  
remote locations.

 — Direct-to-handset satellite connectivity. Partnerships 

between telecom companies and satellite players allow 
direct access from phone to satellite, expanding network 
coverage beyond the reach of traditional cellular towers.8

‘Advanced connectivity enabled an array of industrial use 
cases and transformed the day-to-day lives of people across the 
globe. Creating value for investors is something the telecom 
industry was struggling with quite a bit, as a large share of 
extra profits is going to the tech players sitting on top of the 
advanced telecom networks.’

 — Low-Earth-orbit satellites. A constellation of satellites 

in orbits at relatively low altitudes above Earth’s surface 
can enable connecting remote or inaccessible locations 
with high-speed internet, in addition to other use cases, 
such as satellite imaging.

Key uncertainties 

Key uncertainties of advanced-connectivity adoption vary 
by technology:

 — Telco profitability is being strained as a result of 

competitive pricing, the commoditization of connectivity, 
challenges in monetizing better network quality, and the 
increasing traffic and deployment costs, all of which have 
led to challenging ROI. While advanced connectivity 
undoubtedly creates value, the connectivity layer does 
not currently capture enough to sustain investment.

 — The availability of mature use cases, such as 5G-enabled 
robotics and gaming on the go, caters to both industrial 
verticals and consumers requiring higher-service-level 
agreements, such as high throughput or low latency.

 — Ecosystem maturity plays a critical role in the adoption 

of IoT, whose uptake has been slower than expected as a 
result of a highly fragmented market, security concerns, 
interoperability, complex deployments involving a vast 
assortment of players, and a lack of standardization. 
For 5G and 6G, telecom operators’ monetization 
struggles might affect their ability to build the necessary 
infrastructure for at-scale rollouts globally. 

play a role in regulations and funding for 5G and next-
generation digital infrastructure. Currently, many 
governments are involved in the supply factors, while 
developing demand-side use cases remains the 
exception.

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with advanced connectivity:

 — What fundamental shifts does the telecom industry need 

to make to improve profitability?

 — How will changes in the fiber market (for example, 

financing and delayering) affect network options for 
customers? Will 5G be sufficiently monetized? 

 — What are the expectations from various stakeholders for 

next-generation wireless technologies?

 — What will 6G look like? What needs to happen 

technologically and financially for network equipment 
players, telecom companies, enterprises, and chip 
manufacturers to invest in and monetize 6G?  

 — Will private-network adoption take off? What do 
industrial verticals need to know about it to avoid 
missing out on its benefits?

 — Will there be an oversupply of satellites as providers 

ramp up LEO launches and benefit from technological 
advancements?9

Immersive-reality technologies

The trend—and why it matters
Immersive-reality technologies allow users to experience 
an augmented form of our world or virtual worlds while 
uncovering a series of new use cases for consumers and 
enterprises alike. These technologies simulate the addition 
of objects to real-world settings and enable interactions 
in virtual worlds by using spatial computing to render 
the physical space around users. Industry players have 
taken different approaches that range the spectrum from 

augmented reality (AR) to mixed reality (MR) to virtual 
reality (VR). The year 2023 saw tenuous investment and 
consumer demand, with start-up funding decreasing by 
roughly 50 percent1 and sales of VR headsets down by 40 
percent from 2022.2 Some notable highlights, such as the 
launch of Apple’s Vision Pro headset and continued interest 
from enterprises in digital-twin technology,3 demonstrate 
resilience despite financial and market hurdles.

Latest developments 

Recent developments involving immersive-reality 
technologies include the following:

 — The headset market is experiencing selective growth. 
Over the past year, we have seen standout headset 
launches from Apple and Meta,4 with the Vision Pro and 
Quest 3, respectively. While a significant number of 
units of the Vision Pro were sold at launch, several other 
companies are postponing the release of their headsets 
and deferring investments in hardware development. 
However, despite some delays, hardware development 
is expected to continue. The demand seems to indicate 
the proportion of consumers that are willing to accept 
the size and comfort of today’s headsets for immersive-
reality experiences at current price points.

 — Virtual worlds are expanding beyond their gaming 

roots. Virtual worlds such as Roblox5 and Fortnite6 are 
increasingly offering digital events, such as concerts, 

that allow users to engage with the programs more as 
digital experiences than games. This has led many third 
parties to form partnerships or acquire stakes in these 
platforms, such as LEGO’s partnership with Fortnite, 
which gives consumers a new way to engage with LEGO 
products and increases their brand recognition.7 

 — Enterprise adoption persists, but scaling is taking longer 

than expected. VR use cases persist in enterprise 
adoption, though at-scale adoption is taking longer than 
expected. For AR, additional advances are required to 
see significant enterprise and consumer adoption. One 
area that has seen increased implementation is digital 
twins (a digital representation of a physical object, 
person, or process, contextualized in a digital version 
of its environment to simulate real situations and their 
outcomes). Digital twins have a projected CAGR of 
approximately 30 percent over the next four years and 
have been used in combination with AR for use cases 
including manufacturing and training.8 

‘Virtual-reality and augmented-reality experiences are 
poised to reshape our lives in the coming decade, with 
innovation driving advancements across both enterprise 
and consumer use cases. Recently, we have seen growth in 
B2B applications of immersive-reality technologies such 
as spatial computing—specifically digital twins gaining 
traction for training, testing, and design in industrial 
sectors such as aerospace and defense. On the consumer 
side, virtual- and augmented-reality experiences are 
reshaping consumer engagement by offering immersive 
brand interactions.’

Adoption developments across the globe

Immersive reality falls in the middle for adoption level 
relative to other trends. Most companies that are adopting 
immersive-reality technologies are using them to increase 
the value of existing offerings through integration with the 
technologies.

The technology, media, and telecommunications sector 
has emerged as a leader in adopting immersive-reality 
technologies, with the highest percentage of companies in 
the industry scaling or fully scaling the technology. Capital 
investment has slowed, in line with the macro environment 
and partially as a result of companies narrowing the 
technologies they highly fund.

Adoption dimensions
The adoption trajectory for advanced technologies varies for 
each technology and each use case within that technology. 
For example, consider the potential adoption trajectory for 
AR headsets. Advancements along the following dimensions 
could enable the next level of adoption: 

 — decreases in battery size (that is, battery density of more 
than approximately 400 watt-hours per kilogram to 
construct a small enough battery), headset weight, and 
heat management

Consumers in the virtual world will be able to engage 
with characters and stories in the Disney universe not 
only through games but also through shopping and 
media experiences.10  

 — Porsche announced a partnership with Meta to use its 
Quest 3 MR headsets to facilitate event presentations 
and vehicle walk-throughs. This will allow multiple people 
to move around and interact in a shared VR environment 
during product showcases.11

 — In September 2023, Mercedes-Benz became one of the 
first automakers to implement digital-twin technology on 
Nvidia’s Omniverse platform. Digital twins of its factories 
and assembly lines in more than 30 locations will allow 
factory planners to optimize and streamline production 
line layouts.12 

 — Following Apple’s launch of its new AR headset, Apple 
Vision Pro, in February 2024, several companies have 
begun leveraging the technology to give consumers a 
more immersive product experience. Lowe’s recently 
launched Lowe’s Studio Style, an app that allows 
customers to design kitchen renovations inside 3D 
AR kitchen models, while the PGA launched PGA Tour 
Vision, which lets golf fans follow play and virtually walk 
the course on some of the tour’s most iconic events.13  

 — a larger optical field of view (that is, more than 90 
degrees) to enhance immersive experiences

 — increased computing power to enable seamless 

rendering and complex workloads either on the AR 
device or through external sources

Underlying technologies

Immersive-reality technologies include the following:

 — Augmented reality. AR enables partial immersion by 

adding information to real-world settings.

 — increased immersive display brightness (that is, more 

 — Virtual reality. VR immerses users in entirely virtual 

than 3,000 nits9) to allow for outdoor usage 

settings.

 — customer ecosystems to develop a library of use cases 
for integrating the technology into consumer lifestyle or 
business operations 

 — Mixed reality. MR enables a level of immersion between 
AR and VR, adding virtual elements to the real world so 
that users can interact with both.

In real life 

Real-world examples involving immersive-reality 
technologies include the following: 

 — Disney acquired a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games 
and announced a collaboration between the two 
companies to build a new virtual entertainment universe. 

 — Spatial computing. This type of computing uses the 

perceived 3D physical space around the user as a canvas 
for a user interface.

 — On-body and off-body sensors. These sensors—
embedded in handheld or wearable devices or 
mounted around users—detect objects and bodies for 
representation in virtual settings.

users, usually as vibrations.

 — Location-mapping software. This software integrates 
real-time user physical location and surroundings into 
AR to provide an overlay of the surrounding physical 
environment in the virtual environment.

Key uncertainties

The major uncertainties affecting immersive-reality 
technologies include the following:

 — Hardware and software improvements, particularly for 
AR devices, are needed to enable miniaturization and 
weight reduction, make devices more durable, improve 
sensor precision, increase user comfort, enhance heat 
management, and extend battery life.

 — The pace and level of cost reductions remain uncertain 
but will be needed to make applications more consumer-
friendly and scalable.

 — Growth in the breadth of user needs is still in question. 
While a version of immersive reality exists today, a 
true tipping point where demand grows from targeted 
niche needs to broader mass-market customer usage 
is likely a few years away. Certain business-focused 
considerations, including how end-consumer price 
points evolve, will also affect the pace of adoption. 

 — Mitigating security and privacy concerns related to 

tracking user behavior will be critical to building trust.

considering the usage of vision-limiting AR and VR 
platforms outside of highly controlled environments.

 — Proliferation of form factors. End-user devices take 
multiple forms depending on intended usage, from 
independent AR and VR platforms to peripheral AR 
accessories for mobile phones. The proliferation of 
multiple form factors is creating uncertainty in terms of 
what specific use cases each one is most appropriate for.   

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with immersive-reality 
technologies:

 — What is the potential impact of use cases in various 

settings (for example, home, workplace, commuting)?

 — How and how quickly will device hardware evolve?

 — How will immersive reality shift the new wave of remote 
and hybrid work and the human–machine interface?

 — How will enterprises effectively manage the tech 

infrastructure required for new and evolving use cases?

 — What regulatory frameworks are needed to ensure the 
safety, security, and ethical use of VR technologies, 
including content moderation, data privacy, and 
cybersecurity?

‘As widely expected, the near frenzy around immersive- 
reality technologies has mostly settled. While many global 
start-ups may feel the funding crunch, the committed 
investors and builders that remain will continue on their 
concrete product development and commercialization road 
maps over a more measured five-to-ten-year horizon.’

Cloud and edge computing

The trend—and why it matters

Enterprises are in the process of transitioning away from 
traditional on-site storage and management toward 
distribution across multiple infrastructure points that 
range from remote hyperscale data centers to on-site 
servers at the edge of the business. The public cloud 
allows enterprises to host workloads remotely and scale 
the consumption of computing and storage resources on 
demand, resulting in better economies at scale, flexibility, 
and speed of deployment of applications. With edge 
computing, organizations can process data much closer 

to where the data originate, providing lower latency, 
lower data-transfer costs, and increased data privacy 
compared with the cloud (while adhering to data residency 
laws as well). Cloud and edge computing has amplified AI 
capabilities for both training and inferencing on foundational 
models and will continue to be a major driver for the 
adoption of these technologies. Balancing workloads across 
cloud and edge (and the locations in between) will allow 
enterprises to optimize resourcing, latency, data privacy, and 
security at scale and, in turn, unlock business value.

Latest developments

Recent developments involving cloud and edge computing 
include the following: 

 — The use of cloud and edge computing has grown 

substantially due to additional AI demand. The rise of 
AI in 2023 resulted in a massive increase in cloud and 
edge usage, with a CAGR of approximately 30.9 percent 
expected in the cloud AI market between 2023 and 
2030 and an estimated increase in cloud spend of about 
20.0 percent,1 as companies train and fine-tune models 
and perform inferences. The need for extremely large 
amounts of compute for AI model training has forced 
businesses that have not yet transitioned to the cloud to 
commit to it for AI endeavors, since most on-premises 
data centers cannot meet the compute requirements 
of AI workloads. Start-ups such as Lambda Labs2 and 
CoreWeave3 also took advantage of the AI boom to 
compete with hyperscalers on providing graphics-
processing-unit (GPU) services (“GPU as a service”) for 
enterprises that do not have access to GPU compute on 
their own. 

 — Priority shifts to on-premises edge solutions. Some 
organizations are shifting focus from operating at 
the network and operator edge (computing locations 
situated at sites that are owned by a telecommunications 
operator, such as a central data office in a mobile 
network) to on-premises edge solutions that are closer 
to the end user (such as an on-site data center) to 
minimize latency and data transmit times, while demand 
for private network connectivity has driven customer 

adoption of edge-enabled use cases. A variety of 
enterprise locations are poised to take advantage of 
on-premises edge; they include manufacturing plants, 
restaurants, retail stores, and hospitals.

 — For some use cases, the shift from cloud to edge 

computing marks the next evolution of AI models. While 
2023 was mostly focused on training foundation models 
for AI, companies are expected to begin performing 
inference at scale on their models in 2024. With low 
latency taking priority when performing inference for 
some use cases, some workloads will likely shift to 
the edge as companies begin to put their models into 
commercial use.

 — Companies diversify their GPU supply base. Nvidia’s 

well-documented success in the GPU market throughout 
2023 has improved GPU access for customers, 
from hyperscalers to start-ups such as CoreWeave. 
Companies of all sizes are considering additional 
options for sourcing or building GPUs. For example, 
hyperscalers are exploring and actively working on 
a collection of sources for their compute needs and 
have started designing in-house hardware and chips. 
Other alternatives to Nvidia chips include chips from 
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel.4 However, the 
ability to interchange GPU chips is also affected by the 
software that facilitates their utilization. For instance, 
Nvidia’s CUDA platform presents more challenges in 
chip swapping than other, more standardized software 
solutions. 

‘With the increasing growth of data volumes, particularly 
with the widespread deployment of AI and generative AI use 
cases, edge and cloud will continue to work in tandem. Edge 
infrastructure will play a crucial role in enabling real-time 
inference much closer to the source of data generation. Edge 
will help enterprises maintain their edge.’

‘In 2023, we saw an acceleration of large cloud 
partnerships with CSPs [cloud service providers] in the 
context of scaling generative AI adoption. It will be very 
interesting to see how these will unfold in 2024 and 2025 
as line of sight for real profit-and-loss impact at scale is 
still emerging.’ 

– Andrea Del Miglio, senior partner, Milan

Adoption developments across the globe

Cloud and edge computing is the most widely adopted 
trend across industries and regions, boosted by the growth 
of AI. Most companies adopt cloud and edge computing 
technologies to increase the value of existing offerings, 
lower costs, better serve their customers, and optimize 
the use of computer and storage resources. Companies 
in regions like Africa show a strong interest in adopting 
cloud but struggle with a lack of local data centers from 
hyperscalers, legacy infrastructure, and connectivity 
issues.5 Cloud adoption in the Middle East is growing fast, 
with significant investment in regional data centers.6   

Some of the leading industries in adopting cloud 
and edge computing include technology, media, and 
telecommunications; energy and materials; and financial 
services.

Adoption dimensions
Enterprises are likely to seek improvements in latency, cost, 
and security, spurring the next level of adoption of edge 
computing technologies. Advancements along the following 
dimensions could enable the next level of adoption:

 — Scaled adoption of low-latency use cases (such as self-
driving cars and virtual reality headsets) or an increase 
in AI inferencing needs could lead to a shift from cloud 
to edge computing to improve latency for consumer and 
enterprise use cases and to process data much closer to 
where the data originate.

 — Enterprises could move computation from the cloud 
to the edge, potentially as a result, for example, of 
increased data security requirements.

 — A reduction in the cost of edge connectivity makes it 

more feasible for small and medium-size enterprises to 
migrate relevant, expensive cloud workstreams to the 
edge.

In real life

Real-world examples involving cloud and edge computing 
include the following:

 — McDonald’s and Google Cloud announced a multiyear 
global partnership to use edge computing for the 
restaurant’s mobile app, self-service kiosks, and other 
machinery. They will use a combination of Google’s cloud 
and edge capabilities and McDonald’s own software to 
draw insights on equipment performance and reduce 
complexity for staff.7 

 — In early 2024, the International Space Station (ISS) 
installed a Kioxia (previously Toshiba Memory) solid-
state drive (SSD) for edge computing and AI tasks. This 
upgrades the HPE Spaceborne Computer, the first 
commercial edge-computing and AI-enabled system 
on the ISS, originally installed to reduce dependency on 
mission control for data processing.8 

 — Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all released proprietary 

in-house AI chips.9

Underlying technologies

We see edge being deployed in various formats, depending 
on proximity to the user or data generated and the scale of 
resources involved.

 — Internet of Things (IoT) or device edge. IoT devices, such 
as sensors and video cameras, are used to collect and 
process data. These devices often come with basic 
computing and storage capabilities.

 — On-premise or “close to the action” edge. These are 

computing and storage resources deployed within the 
premises or a remote or mobile location where data are 
being generated.

 — Operator, network, and mobile edge computing 

(MEC). These are private or public computing and 
storage resources deployed at the edge of a mobile or 
converged-services provider’s network, typically one 
network hop away from enterprise premises.

 — Metro edge. Data centers with smaller footprints (about 
three megawatts) located in large metro areas augment 
the public cloud with near-premises computing power 
and storage to provide lower latency and greater 
availability. 

Key uncertainties 

The major uncertainties affecting cloud and edge computing 
include the following:

 — Scaling hurdles could arise as the number of edge nodes 
and devices grows, because edge computing does not 
benefit from the same economies of scale as traditional 
cloud computing. 

 — There is limited availability of talent and management 

buy-in. Companies scaling cloud computing often face a 
shortage of in-house talent to implement cloud solutions 
effectively. This shortage poses challenges in identifying 
new use cases tailored to the local context, such as 
those specific to a retail store. Additionally, it hinders  
the scaling of cloud infrastructure. This challenge 
is further exacerbated if there is a lack of local 
management buy-in.

 — Technical challenges make it difficult to maintain and 

scale cloud computing. The complexity of ML/AI models 
and the absence of readily deployable solutions pose 
significant challenges for companies seeking to build 
cloud-computing capabilities. Additionally, maintaining 
and managing edge hardware at scale can be tedious. 
Furthermore, current 5G MEC coverage is not yet 
extensive enough to support the scaling of use cases.

 — Other challenges include limited ROI visibility, an overall 
longer path to returns for edge development, a lack 
of customer understanding of value-add use cases, 
large investment requirements for scaling from pilot 
to at-scale implementations, a complicated technical 
stack requirement (especially due to integration with the 
existing tech landscape at most companies), and a lack 
of ready-to-deploy solutions.

 — Privacy in the cloud is still a concern for many 

enterprises. Some organizations are subject to strict 
data privacy laws and are generally hesitant to make 
a full migration to the cloud in the event of a breach or 
cyberattack. 

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with cloud and edge 
computing:

 — Will flexibility and positioning in a business and 

regulatory sweet spot make edge more disruptive than 
cloud? Or will inhibitors such as lack of interoperability 
and commonality of standards in networking prevent 
edge from reaching its full potential?

 — Will hyperscale cloud providers be leaders in edge 
computing? And how will telecommunications 
companies with 5G-enabled MEC contend or partner 
with hyperscalers?

 — How will rapidly evolving AI technology and, importantly, 
accompanying regulatory changes alter cloud and edge 
provider business models?

 — How will specialized chips deployed both in data 

centers and at the edge, such as AI inference or always-
on sensors, modify the competitive cloud and edge 
landscape?

 — Will the increase in the number of storage and 

processing units lead to security vulnerabilities?

 — How will the transition to green infrastructure facilitate 
the continued evolution of cloud and edge technology? 

 — As sensor costs drop and their performance increases, 
how will edge and cloud resources cope with growing 
demand for data movement and AI-enabled analytics?

 — Will reduced connectivity costs drive more edge 

adoption?

Quantum technologies

The trend—and why it matters

Quantum technologies encompass three pillars: quantum 
computing, which not only will provide a speedup over 
current computing systems for certain problems but also 
could enable applications that are impossible to implement 
on classical computers; quantum communication, which will 
be critical for secure communication in the era of quantum 
computers; and quantum sensing, which provides higher 
sensitivity in more modalities than conventional sensors for 
specific applications. The estimated full potential economic 
impact of these technologies could be upward of roughly 
$0.9 trillion. While the actual quantum advantage for useful 

applications is still outstanding, we see promising research 
and experimentation within pioneering enterprises across 
industries, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, finance, 
automotive, and aerospace. In 2023, we saw steady 
progress on both the hardware and software fronts while 
organizations took more practical steps to ensure that their 
infrastructure and security are ready for the technology. 
Quantum technology must overcome a series of technical 
hurdles to unlock its proposed benefits, which requires both 
private and public sector efforts. It’s strategically wise for 
companies to invest intelligently now to capitalize on future 
advancements.

COMPUTE AND CONNECTIVITY FRONTIERS
Quantum technologies
Scoring the trend
Despite continued interest and innovation in the past 
few years, quantum technologies saw a slowdown in 
private investments. The 2022–23 period marked a 
shift in investment toward more established companies, 
with 62 percent of funding directed to companies 
founded more than five years ago, reflecting a focus on 
scaling promising ventures. However, public sector 
investment in this field increased in 2023, underscoring 
a sustained commitment to advancing quantum 
technologies. While there is a long road ahead before 
companies can achieve large-scale fault-tolerant 
quantum computing, the groundbreaking potential for 
quantum technology to be leveraged in appropriate use 
cases could allow early innovators to extract significant 
value once key performance milestones are met.

Latest developments 

 — Strides have been made in information security 

Recent developments involving quantum technologies 
include the following:

 — Major steps forward in error correction have occurred. 
In collaboration with QuEra, MIT, and the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Harvard 
researchers demonstrated large-scale algorithms on 48 
logical units, with an error rate below 0.5 percent. This 
breakthrough was followed recently by a collaboration 
between Microsoft and Quantinuum that produced four 
reliable qubits with an error rate below 0.01 percent.1  
Teams at IBM2 and Google’s Quantum AI3 also made 
advances throughout the year to push the boundaries 
of logical qubit storage, error rate per cycle, and error 
frequency. These developments could serve as a 
promising stepping stone to necessary advancements 
on the long road from focusing on record qubit numbers 
to achieving higher-quality, scalable qubits capable of 
delivering meaningful results. Open hardware questions 
about the efficacy of several qubit technologies are 
currently being explored, as each has its own benefits, 
challenges, and optimal use cases. 

 — Additional emphasis is being placed on building out 
the full stack, including software and the integration 
of quantum into classical computing infrastructure. 
Quantum computers will be useful only for a small 
but impactful set of problems; therefore, it will be 
important to think about which parts are calculated on a 
quantum-processing unit (QPU) versus other computer 
architectures (for example, central processing units and 
graphics processing units). Moreover, while there are 
many technological hurdles to overcome, there has been 
additional emphasis on building out the rest of the stack, 
from software development kits (such as IBM’s Qiskit) 
to testing and simulation of quantum algorithms (such 
as NVIDIA’s Quantum Cloud that was built on its open-
source CUDA platform in March 2024). 

because of the progress in quantum computing. Major 
tech players are ramping up their information security 
measures to reduce the risk of newer threats emerging 
from advancements in quantum computing. These are 
termed “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks, where 
data expected to have a long shelf life are captured 
and stored so they can be decrypted once quantum 
computers are powerful enough to crack today’s 
classical public key encryption such as RSA or elliptic-
curve cryptography. For instance, various organizations 
are enhancing these classical public key encryptions 
with postquantum-cryptography algorithms this year. 
This allows these organizations to proactively mitigate 
the risks of harvest now, decrypt later attacks with 
currently available classical tools ahead of potential 
additional quantum-level protection—such as quantum 
key distribution (QKD)—maturing and becoming 
available. In December 2022, the Biden administration 
signed into law the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity 
Preparedness Act, asking government agencies to 
“adopt technology that will protect against quantum 
computing attacks.”4 Various intergovernmental 
organizations have also published policies and strategies 
to develop quantum technologies and prepare for 
potential quantum cyberattacks. 

 — Start-up partnerships with conventional enterprises 

continue. Quantum computing start-ups and 
conventional enterprises announced more partnerships 
in 2023. These continue to occur as start-ups attempt to 
get closer to the proposed use cases of their computers 
and conventional enterprises try to gain a future 
competitive edge. For example, Rolls-Royce partnered 
with quantum start-up Riverlane to develop algorithms 
and computational tools to accelerate complex material 
discovery for jet engines and other components in 
hostile environments.5

Talent and labor markets

Quantum technologies
Demand
While quantum technology has a small labor market, talent demand has more than doubled since 2019. Given 
the nascency of the technology, the number of graduates from quantum-specific programs is low. As a result, 
talent is sourced from the broader fields of physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, chemistry, biochemis-
try, and chemical engineering. All told, approximately 367,000 people graduated in 2023 with degrees relevant 
to quantum technology, with the number of universities offering programs and master’s degrees in quantum 
technology increasing by 8.3 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively, over the past year.¹  
While quantum-technology talent demand saw a slight decrease in 2023, in line with the broader talent 
market, the hiring mix of applied roles, such as data scientists, and more specialized roles, such as software 
engineers, lines up with the path followed by more mature technologies, such as AI. As quantum technology 
continues to develop, this shift toward more specialized hiring will likely strengthen.

Adoption developments across the globe

Given quantum technology’s nascency, it is unsurprising 
that it is one of the least widely adopted technologies 
across our set of analyzed trends. However, the potential 
for future quantum applications to be disruptive in select 
sectors and use cases has inspired several companies to 
engage in experimentation and pilots of different quantum 
technologies. These companies most commonly see 
the ultimate goal of adopting quantum technologies as 
increasing the value of existing offerings through better 
outcomes or products (for example, optimized portfolios 
and routing). 

The finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, energy and 
materials (including chemicals), and telecommunications 
sectors have emerged as leaders in the adoption of 
quantum technologies, with more than roughly 40 percent 
of companies in these industries reporting that they are 
conducting experiments and pilots. These industries 
cover both shapers of quantum technologies (primarily 
telecommunications and technology) and eventual end 
users, with significant use cases across chemicals, 
finance, and pharmaceuticals. Investments in quantum 
communications are driven by improvements in quantum-
resistant cryptography and QKD to protect against future 
decryption attacks by quantum computers, indicating a 
forward-looking approach to managing risk. 

Adoption dimensions
The adoption trajectory of advanced technologies varies for 
each technology and each use case within that technology. 
If or when certain technical challenges are overcome, the 

dawn of quantum computers that are powerful enough 
to jeopardize current encryption provides a potentially 
disruptive use case for quantum technologies. 

The next level of adoption likely will involve companies 
leveraging quantum computers to significantly speed up 
the solution to a set of valuable computational problems. 
Additionally, companies will be motivated to enhance their 
encryption methods to include postquantum cryptography, 
ensuring the protection of mission-critical and long-lived 
digital data. 

Advancements along the following dimensions could enable 
the next level of adoption for quantum technologies:

 — to achieve further milestones suitable for large-scale 
fault-tolerant computing, an increased number of 
physical qubits (that is, greater than 1,000) with lower 
error rates (that is, 10–6 or less) across several qubit 
platforms (for example, superconducting and spin), along 
with a road map to scalably interconnect qubits and 
possibly chips of qubits

 — to increase reliability, an increased number of logical, 

error-corrected qubits (more than 50 to 100) 

 — to secure data that retains its value over several years, 
implementation of quantum-resistant cryptographic 
algorithms (such as the four algorithms selected in 2022 
by NIST: CRYSTALS-Kyber for key establishment and 
CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS for digital 
signatures)

‘While the technology still faces challenges, significant 
advancements have been made this year, especially in the 
field of error correction. In addition, major enterprises are 
actively working to improve encryption by incorporating 
postquantum-cryptographic algorithms. This highlights the 
importance of taking proactive measures now to minimize 
the impact of potential “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks.’

In real life 

 — Several successful quantum-communications 

Real-world examples involving the use of quantum 
technologies include the following:

 — Banks are partnering with quantum businesses to 

build their capabilities. HSBC, for example, announced 
a partnership with quantum computing start-up 
Quantinuum. The companies will work together to 
explore the benefits of quantum machine learning 
and quantum natural-language processing to analyze 
customer data more accurately and prevent fraud.6 

 — Apple upgraded its iMessage encryption with a new 
protocol known as PQ3 that utilizes postquantum 
cryptography to protect messages against future 
encryption breaches from quantum computers.7 The 
company joins messaging app Signal in using the NIST-
selected Kyber algorithm.8  

 — The Biden administration, through the US Department 
of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration 
(EDA), designated 31 tech hubs across the United States, 
including the Bloch Tech Hub (Bloch), a consortium 
led by the Chicago Quantum Exchange,9 and Elevate 
Quantum Colorado (led by Elevate Quantum). Bloch 
will make use of Chicago’s universities, national labs, 
private quantum companies, investors, accelerators, and 
other partners to increase access to quantum facilities 
and meet industry demand. Elevate Quantum Colorado 
encompasses the Denver–Aurora region of Colorado 
and has proposed initiatives focused on infrastructure, 
entrepreneurship, workforce development, and 
stakeholder engagement throughout the quantum  
value chain.10 

milestones occurred throughout 2023. New York 
University and Qunnect performed a successful test 
of a ten-mile quantum network between Brooklyn and 
Manhattan, with 99 percent uptime.11 Amazon Web 
Services (AWS) researchers conducted a successful 
test of point-to-point QKD between two devices three 
miles apart in Singapore.12 A team of scientists from 
Russia and China established an encrypted quantum-
communication link using secure keys over 3,800 
kilometers, leveraging China’s quantum satellite, Mozi.13 

Underlying technologies

Noteworthy quantum technologies include the following:

 — Quantum computing. Quantum processors use the 

principles of quantum mechanics to perform simulations 
and process information. They can provide exponential 
performance improvements over classical computers for 
some applications. 

 — Quantum communication. This is the secure transfer 
of quantum information across space. It could ensure 
security of communications, enabled by quantum 
cryptography, even in the face of unlimited (quantum) 
computing power.

 — Quantum key distribution. QKD is the use of quantum 

technology to secure communications against possible 
attacks by quantum computers.

 — Quantum sensing. Quantum sensors could provide 
measurements of various physical quantities at a 
sensitivity that exceeds those of classical sensors by 
orders of magnitude.

‘Recent advancements in quantum computing show that 
we are moving away from research toward real application. 
It’s interesting to see that these advancements happen 
currently across different technologies. So the race for the 
best technology or combination of technologies—and how 
best to use them—is still on.’  

– Henning Soller, partner, Frankfurt

Key uncertainties

Big questions about the future

The major uncertainties affecting quantum technologies 
include the following:

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with quantum technologies:

 — On what timeline over the next decade will quantum 
technology advance and reach major milestones (for 
example, full error correction, quantum advantage, and 
vulnerability of current RSA encryption)? 

 — What benefits could arise from the combination of 

quantum and AI?

 — How and when should companies start to prepare for 
quantum technology, particularly the security threats 
posed by quantum computers?

 — Will talent supply catch up to demand? What levers  
are available, and how can organizations help fill the 
talent gap?

 — Technical challenges include the ability to manage a 
sufficient quantity and quality of qubits over enough 
time to derive meaningful computational results while 
navigating potential barriers to adoption (for example, 
regulatory, technological, and financial) that are not yet 
apparent. 

 — Cost-effectiveness may take time. Traditional 

supercomputers can perform most calculations that 
businesses require reasonably well and at a much 
lower cost; this is expected to change once quantum 
advantage is achieved and general-purpose quantum 
computers take center stage.

 — Ecosystems are nascent. Limited awareness and 

adoption of quantum technologies (such as differing 
levels of technology maturity and applicability 
for different industries), the need for increased 
interdisciplinary coordination required to bring 
technologies to market (for example, between academia 
and industry), and quantum companies’ continued 
work to access talent (talent includes theory, hardware, 
and software development) hinder development and 
innovation outside quantum hubs.

Future of robotics

The trend—and why it matters

Advanced robotic systems are characterized by their high 
sophistication in automating a variety of physical tasks. 
The range of use cases—from consumer-level services 
to enterprise-level assembly—has proliferated in recent 
years because of both macroeconomic conditions and 
technological advances. In terms of macroeconomics, the 
world has seen rising labor costs, aging populations, and 
additional complexity regarding offshoring labor, leading to 

tight labor markets in many countries.1 From a technological 
perspective, AI has led to many innovations that have 
increased the capabilities and accelerated the training of 
physical robots. While there are technological and social 
hurdles to overcome, widescale adoption can be key to 
unlocking productivity, shifting the economy to incorporate 
new ways of working that are fundamentally different from 
current human-centric jobs.

with more autonomous, more dexterous, and more mobile 
machines emerging [at scale]. These advances promise a 
future where robots enhance our capabilities and expand 
the operational domains of automation, from intricate tasks

Latest developments 

Recent developments involving the future of robotics 
include the following:

 — A proliferation of sectors are adopting robots. With 

increasing capabilities and decreasing costs, robots 
are branching out from assembly and manufacturing to 
new sectors such as life sciences and agriculture. In life 
sciences, for example, we have seen a surge in interest 
in automated liquid handling—robots that assist with 
pipetting, handling, and transferring liquid chemicals 
for drug development—with a range of off-the-shelf 
and custom robot options for buyers and an estimated 
market value of approximately $3 billion in 2023.2 In 
agriculture, restaurant chain Chipotle announced at 
the end of 2023 that it was investing in GreenField, a 
company that builds autonomous, lightweight robots 
that can cut weeds without damaging crops.3  

 — The types of robots are expanding. Robot types 

are expanding beyond the typical industrial robots. 
Companies in the electronics industry are using newer, 
small-scale collaborative robots (cobots) that can be 
placed on desktops to aid in material handling and 
assembly. Service robots have also seen steady growth, 
with a forecasted CAGR of approximately 18 percent 
over the next five years4 and expansion to mostly 
commercial-sector operations in the form of cleaning 
and kitchen robots. In 2023, Miso Robotics and Cali 
Group opened an automated restaurant in Pasadena, 
California—equipped with sensors, cameras, and 
algorithms, Miso’s smart commercial kitchen robot can 

cook a variety of food items and is not limited to a single 
type of cuisine or dish.5  

 — Humanoid and general-purpose robots have surged in 
interest. Although most robots are still used for specific 
tasks, AI has led to considerable interest in humanoid 
robots, which have the potential of being deployed in 
environments that will require minimal retrofitting. While 
early demonstrations still show limited functionality, 
humanoid robots are already being tested in commercial 
settings and garnering investor interest. Humanoid 
robot start-ups Figure and 1X Technologies closed $675 
million and $100 million funding rounds, respectively, 
with major investors including Microsoft, Nvidia, and 
OpenAI. 

 — AI continues to boost progress toward more 

autonomous robots. AI has been crucial to the 
development of robotics, through both the construction 
of new algorithms and techniques as well as the 
refinement of older ones. New generative AI 
approaches, such as Covariant’s robotics foundation 
models or Toyota Research Institute’s Large Behavioral 
Models (LBMs), train robots to react to unexpected 
situations and build generalizable skills. Toyota’s 
LBMs, for example, allow robots to learn a series 
of fundamental skills, such as pouring liquids and 
using tools, by observing humans. These skills are 
generalizable to many more tasks, with the company 
aiming to improve its current skill count from 60 to 1,000 
by the end of 2024.6

Adoption developments across the globe

Robotics technologies saw the highest experimentation 
rates and have had one of the lowest levels of investment 
out of all trends, indicating its emergence as a nascent 
trend with significant advancement opportunities. However, 
we do see advanced-industries companies making the 
largest average initial and run-rate investments in gross 
dollars, highlighting the maturity of robotics use cases in the 
automotive and manufacturing sectors. 

Adoption dimensions
We define the next level of adoption of humanoid or 
general-purpose robots as their wide-scale deployment 
in factories and commercial pilots at other enterprises. 
Advancements along the following dimensions could enable 
the next level of adoption:

 — increased dexterity so that robots can manipulate 
objects at a similar skill level as that of their human 
counterparts (for example, for assembly-line tasks)

 — improved battery life, allowing robots to operate 

untethered for most of a standard working day (that is, 
approximately eight hours)

 — sufficient autonomy so that robots can operate in 

certain edge-case scenarios without requiring human 
intervention when difficulties are encountered (for 
example, the ability to troubleshoot and decide on the 
next action in case of unexpected circumstances)

In real life 

Real-world examples involving the future of robotics include 
the following:

 — BMW and robotics start-up Figure signed a partnership 
that would bring the start-up’s humanoid robots to 
BMW’s auto manufacturing facilities. After undergoing 
training to perform the related functions, the robots will 
operate in the body shop, warehouse, and sheet metal 
line in the next one to two years.

 — Chevron has been using robotics company Boston 
Dynamics’ four-legged Spot robot in its oil and gas 
operations. The Spot robots are equipped with 
many different sensors to help in operations, safety, 

inspections, and more. Spot has been considered for 
use in environmental and safety monitoring, as well as in 
emergency management. 

 — After acquiring robot kitchen start-up Spyce in 2021, 

Sweetgreen opened its first restaurant that uses kitchen 
robots in 2023. The company claims that it can reduce 
the time needed to make a bowl by 50 percent and that 
the location employing the robot had 10 percent higher 
average tickets, faster throughput, and improved order 
accuracy.7  

 — In preparation for future deep-space infrastructure 

construction, such as solar-power stations, 
communications towers, and crew shelters, NASA 
developed robots that learned how to build a shelter on 
their own in about 100 hours. The test involved three 
robots—two builders and one fastener—that were 
given plans for the shelter and had to use software and 
digital simulations to determine the best approach for 
constructing the building. 

Underlying technologies

A future of more autonomous and dexterous robots will 
depend on the following technologies:

 — Autonomous technologies. Automated systems with 

sensors and AI can make independent decisions based 
on data they collect.

 — Motion and sensor technology. This technology involves 
using actuators, motors, and sensors that can enhance 
dexterity, movement, and environmental perception and 
could expand the set of use cases.

 — Connectivity technologies. Technologies such as 5G/6G, 
private networks, and the Internet of Things can enable 
real-time updates and improved security levels. 

 — Materials innovation. Using new materials (for example, 

carbon fiber and other lightweight materials) and 
processes (for example, 3D printing) can improve 
efficiency and sustainability.

 — Electrification technologies. These solutions allow 

robots to operate untethered for longer time frames, 
leading to increased versatility.

Key uncertainties 

The major uncertainties affecting the future of robotics 
include the following:

 — Safety, privacy, and accountability concerns could arise 
as robots become further integrated with society and 
work alongside humans.

 — The impact on the labor market and public perception 
might initially be negative. Although adoption of the 
trend has the potential to automate many work activities, 
it can also provide the opportunity to redesign the job 
market for new roles. Integration of robots into the 
workforce would most likely require training to upskill 
human workers for different roles or to work effectively 
with their new counterparts.

 — Access to sufficient resources, such as batteries 

and talent, will remain critical to both the technology 
development and supply of future products. 

 — The potential for regulatory shifts adds significant 

uncertainty to the market outlook, as some companies 
are concerned that regulation could reshape 
technological development and deployment plans, 
potentially leading to inconsistent practices and 
challenges in ensuring accountability and public trust in 
the development and deployment of these technologies.

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with robotics:

 — At what rate will companies adopt robots into their 

organizations? 

 — How will integration with robots reshape the workforce 

of the future?

 — When can we expect general-purpose robots?

 — What new business use cases may be created by 

 — Cross-border competition can have an outsize effect on 

advanced robots? 

global technology trade flows.

‘Labor scarcity, the need for manufacturing flexibility, 
and the productivity imperative are expected to remain 
key drivers of growth in the robotics industry. Humanoid 
robots powered by AI are anticipated to offer significant 
flexibility, enabling them to shift from single-purpose robots 
to multifunctional machines. This increased flexibility is 
expected to further propel growth in the robotics industry, 
as manufacturers seek to optimize their production processes 
and increase efficiency.’

Future of mobility

The trend—and why it matters

Technical advancements, coupled with rising sustainability 
concerns, have given rise to a new era of mobility. 
Autonomous and electric vehicles (AVs and EVs), urban 
air mobility, and ACES (autonomous driving, connectivity, 
electrification, and shared/smart mobility) technologies 
have become the focus of many organizations trying 
to revolutionize the transport of people and goods 
while improving accessibility, safety, and sustainability.1  
Although the regulatory environment remains nascent, 
ACES technology has seen accelerating adoption by both 

new industry players and incumbents in the automotive 
and aerospace industries. For example, 2023 saw 
more major steps on the path to wide-scale adoption of 
these technologies, with commercial pilot programs of 
autonomous robo-taxis in major cities and flight testing of 
urban aircraft. Even with high growth projections and early 
signs of success for many of these technologies, innovators 
still wrestle with technological, regulatory, and consumer 
sentiment issues, which have added volatility to the industry 
over the past year.

Latest developments 

Recent developments involving the future of mobility 
include the following:

 — EV demand remains high, despite recent slowing growth 
in major regions. EVs have been soaring in popularity 
for several years and remain in high demand, despite 
the recent slowing growth rate in certain regions.2 
EVs saw record sales in 2023, but manufacturers 
are seeing slowing consumer demand with lower 
growth projections for 2024, partially because of high 
prices and customer range anxiety. This is leaving 
automakers with high EV inventory and forcing some to 
cut prices. The industry is now exploring how to make 
EVs meaningfully cheaper, particularly in the United 
States and Europe. Even China, the world’s largest 
EV market, saw a slowdown in growth in 2023 that 
coincided with reduced subsidies, touching off a price 
war among domestic and foreign manufacturers.3 The 
battery industry continues to grow quickly because of 
heavy public and private investment in EV development. 
For example, approximately 30 battery factories are 
currently planned, being constructed, or operational in 
the United States alone; 13 of them are expected to open 
by 2025.

 — Robo-taxis navigate hurdles to achieve more 

widespread commercial use. In August 2023, California 
regulators granted Waymo and Cruise permission to 
operate commercial robo-taxi services in San Francisco. 
However, following a series of safety incidents, Cruise 
had its license revoked in October. Waymo continues its 
commercial operations and has gained initial regulatory 
approval to expand within California and operate on 
highways. China issued its first regulation on commercial 

AVs in December 2023, requiring a robo-taxi to remote-
operator ratio of no more than 3:1.

 — Autonomous trucking reaches a pivotal moment as 
testing begins. The year 2024 could be a watershed 
one for autonomous trucking as companies begin 
larger-scale on-the-road pilots. This is especially the 
case in the United States, where demand has been 
demonstrated, given that the trucking industry has 
been experiencing a shortage of drivers. Start-ups are 
beginning commercial tests amid a mixed regulatory and 
investment environment. Aurora Innovation, a company 
specializing in self-driving technology, began an on-the-
road pilot for commercial trucking on public highways 
between Houston and Dallas, with the goal of achieving 
fully autonomous trips by the end of 2024. Like the 
industry for robo-taxis, the autonomous trucking sector 
faces regulatory challenges related to safety concerns. 
However, interest remains strong.

 — Micromobility generally demonstrates resilience amid 
market consolidation. The micromobility sector has 
shown signs of steady growth and robust progress. 
Lime, an e-scooter start-up, reported that for the first 
time in 2022, it achieved profitability, which continued 
into the first half of 2023. Users of micromobility 
are also wide ranging: a National Association of City 
Transportation Officials (NACTO) report indicates that 
customer segments of micromobility include commuters, 
tourists, and recreational users.4 As the micromobility 
market progressed in 2023, it saw increased 
consolidation in a bid to compete for funding and chase 
profitability while also seeing postpandemic demand 
levels for e-bikes decline in Europe.

‘Batteries require building new supply chains 
from raw materials to recycling to enable the 
energy transition in mobility.’

 — The scale and breadth of drone delivery operations have 
increased. In 2023, commercial drone deliveries saw a 14 
percent increase from 2022, exceeding one million, and 
drone delivery was the only future mobility technology 
to see a significant increase in funding.5 This growth is 
partially due to favorable regulatory developments, such 
as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granting 
120 waivers for beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) 
operations in 2023.6 This includes approvals for drone 
delivery players such as UPS Flight Forward, Wing 
Aviation, and Zipline, representing a 65 percent increase 
in waivers from 2022. BVLOS operations allow drones 
to fly farther, with less costly oversight from nearby 
pilots or visual observers, making expanded operations 
possible and the economics attractive.7 

 — Funding for eVTOL aircraft experienced a slight 

decline, but the potential for certification maintains 
momentum. Funding for electric vertical takeoff and 
landing (eVTOL) aircraft experienced a slight decline, 
with eVTOL companies securing only about 50 percent 
of the funding they received in 2022. However, there is a 
positive outlook regarding potential certifications from 
regulatory bodies, which could reinvigorate the segment. 
To support this growth, players are developing additional 
infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities, including 
charging facilities and landing sites. The approval for 
commercial flights for eVTOL operators is expected to 
further accelerate the expansion of this infrastructure.

‘While last year saw both advances and setbacks, 
we’ve gotten another step closer to autonomous 
vehicles being a reality at scale. The first mass 
adoption use cases will be in autonomous trucks, 
robo-taxis, and robo-shuttles, with further advances 
in autonomy levels for personal vehicles at the same 
time. Remote operating is another interesting use case 
that we expect to grow sizably over the next years.’

Adoption developments across the globe

Among the trends observed this year, the future of mobility 
trend ranks in the bottom three for initial investment, 
adoption, and optimism. These rankings can be seen as 
indicators of the significant innovation, regulatory, and 
behavioral hurdles companies will have to overcome to 
reach next-level adoption of future mobility technologies. 

Adoption dimensions
The adoption trajectory varies for technologies and use 
cases within the future of mobility trend. For example, robo-
taxi and robo-shuttle ridesharing illustrate the potential 
adoption trajectory for consumer use cases of future 
mobility technology. 

As an extension of public transit and an alternative to 
traditional ridesharing and private vehicles, the next level of 
adoption for robo-taxis and robo-shuttles could be at-scale 
deployment of fleets in significant metropolitan areas and 
across all road types. 

Advancements along the following dimensions could enable 
the next level of adoption:

 — safety and technological reliability to be demonstrated 
for both highway and city operations to fully cover 
metropolitan areas (currently, human drivers have 
approximately five incidents per million miles)8

 — robo-taxis and robo-shuttles to become comparable to 

traditional ridesharing options in terms of cost

 — regulatory changes to lay the groundwork for scalability 
of robo-taxis in major metropolitan areas (currently, 
there are around half a dozen cities in the United States 
and China piloting the technology)9

In real life 

Real-world examples involving the future of mobility include 
the following:

 — After performing more than 700,000 robo-taxi trips 
in 2023,10 Waymo gained approval to expand its 

commercial robo-taxi services to additional parts of the 
San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. This 
expansion allows the company to operate on highways 
for the first time in designated areas. Meanwhile, Baidu’s 
Apollo Go gained approval to offer 24/7 services of its 
robo-taxis and to begin operating on highways to Beijing 
Daxing International Airport, making Beijing the first 
capital city to offer airport robo-taxi rides.11 

 — Uber had its first profitable year as a public company 

in 2023, with a net income of about $4 billion. This was 
driven by a combination of robust user growth and more 
efficient cost management practices. This milestone 
could be a potential inflection point for the company 
as it shifts from a growth-focused start-up to a more 
mature profit-oriented company and serves as a positive 
indicator of the viability of the mobility model.

 — Joby Aviation signed a six-year contract with Dubai’s 
Road and Transport Authority to conduct air taxi 
services in the city by early 2026, with Joby aiming to 
commence operations as early as 2025. The company’s 
aircraft are built to carry a driver, a pilot, and four 
passengers at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. In 
February 2024, Joby became the first developer of 
eVTOL aircraft to complete the third of five stages of the 
FAA type certification process.12  

 — E-scooter start-ups Tier Mobility and Dott merged 

to form Europe’s largest e-scooter company, with an 
additional $66 million fusion into the newly formed 
business. This merger will allow for operations spanning 
20 countries in cities such as Berlin, London, Paris, and 
Rome, with a combined annual revenue of about $250 
million.

 — Many EV automakers—including Ford and General 

Motors—announced that they would adopt Tesla’s North 
American Charging Standard (NACS) port in an effort to 
gain access to the company’s extensive supercharging 
network amid consumer concerns about unreliable 
third-party chargers.

Underlying technologies

A future of efficient, sustainable mobility will be defined by 
ACES and adjacent technologies, such as the following:

 — Autonomous technologies. Automated systems with 

sensors and AI can make independent mobility decisions 
based on data they collect.

 — Connected-vehicle technologies. Equipment, 

applications, and systems use vehicle-to-everything 
communications to improve safety and efficiency.

 — Electrification technologies. These solutions replace 
vehicle components that operate on a conventional 
energy source with those that operate on electricity.

 — Shared-mobility solutions. Hardware and advanced 
digital solutions, as well as new business models and 
social adoption, enable the use of alternative shared 
modes of transportation in addition to—or instead of—
privately owned vehicles.

 — Materials innovation. The use of new materials (for 

example, carbon fiber and other lightweight materials) 
and processes (such as engine downsizing) can improve 
efficiency and sustainability.

 — Value chain decarbonization. In addition to 

electrification, technical levers (such as green primary 
materials) can abate emissions from materials’ 
production and increase recycled materials’ use.

Key uncertainties 

The major uncertainties affecting the future of mobility 
include the following:

 — The global energy supply expansion that is required 
to meet EV demand remains uncertain. Demand for 
lithium-ion batteries is surging as EV production 
expands, necessitating more and larger battery 
factories. At the same time, critical upgrades are 
required to EV-charging infrastructure. Europe, for 
instance, may need to invest upward of €240 billion 
to complete extensive utility grid updates, increase 
renewable-energy production capacity, and provide the 
estimated 3.4 million public charging points required by 
2030 (up from 375,000 in 2021).13 

 — Safety and accountability concerns surround uncrewed 

and autonomous-mobility technologies.

 — Technology uncertainties about batteries with sufficient 
range to support more applications (such as air mobility) 
may hinder greater adoption.

 — Customer perceptions of noise and visual impact 

remain in play (for example, noise pollution from delivery 
drones).

 — Equipment and infrastructure costs are factors for 
new modes of transportation (for instance, building 
EV-charging networks).

 — Regulation shifts will occur as mainstream certification 
frameworks are developed (for example, controlling 
expanded air traffic). 

 — Privacy and security concerns for underlying AI 

algorithms and workflows that rely on consumer data 
should be addressed.

 — Access to sufficient resources (such as raw materials 
for battery production and software developers for 
autonomous-driving software) will be required to scale 
these technologies.

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with ACES technologies:

 — How will the future of mobility trends shape cities?

 — What regulatory enablers and barriers need to be 

addressed to enable widespread adoption?

 — What share of vehicle sales will autonomous vehicles 

account for, and what business models will predominate?

 — What achievements need to be made to win over 

consumer trust for autonomous vehicles and urban air 
mobility? 

 — What scale will advanced air mobility achieve in the next 

decade? 

 — What needs to be in place for advancements in 

shared mobility to deliver on anticipated financial and 
environmental impact?

granted regulatory approval for Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ 
Casgevy, the first gene therapy that uses the renowned 
CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The therapy treats rare 
blood disorders such as sickle cell disease and beta 
thalassemia, marking a significant moment for the 
technology.2

 — Researchers continue to discover new uses for AI in 
bioengineering. Advancements in AI led to additional 
successes in bioengineering in 2023. Although 
generative AI has been used in the industry for research 
and trials, many of the recent advancements in protein 
engineering and drug repurposing have used other 
proprietary AI algorithms. For example, researchers 
at the University of Pennsylvania used an AI ranking 
algorithm to reveal a previously unknown use for an 
existing drug to treat a man with idiopathic multicentric 

Castleman disease (iMCD). While using the drug for this 
purpose has not yet been tested or approved at scale, its 
utilization in this case shows promising potential. 

 — Advances in alternative-protein production continue 

despite regulatory constraints. There has been renewed 
interest in using technologies such as precision 
fermentation for producing alternative proteins. Having 
already shown its viability, the technology, which is more 
sustainable than other forms of alternative-protein 
production, was granted safety approval in 2023, with 
New Culture becoming the first company to achieve 
a generally-recognized-as-safe (GRAS) grading for 
its animal-free protein. Cultivated meat, another form 
of alternative protein, has seen a mixed regulatory 
environment, however. Italy banned the production of 
cultivated meat in a bid to protect farmers, while the 
Netherlands became the first EU government to allow 
cultivated-meat tastings.

‘We may look back at the past year as the point 
in time when gene editing became ‘everyday.’ 
We now have approved cures for a well-known 
and widespread disease like sickle cell anemia 
and also have more consumer-oriented products, 
including purple tomatoes and glow-in-the-dark 
plants. Genetic modification has been around and 
commercialized for years but never before in such a 
tangible way for the average person.’

‘The momentum of progress in bioengineering 
remains strong, driven by breakthroughs in generative 
AI technologies that have unlocked new pathways 
for innovation. The excitement surrounding these 
advancements has already led to notable developments, 
particularly in areas like protein engineering and drug 
repurposing. We can only expect more, and faster, 
adoption of these technologies as biopharma and other 
industries continue advancing their use of generative AI.’ 

– Erika Stanzl, partner, Zurich

Adoption developments across the globe

In real life 

The adoption of bioengineering technologies is low relative 
to other trends, as they are specific to certain industries and 
have higher up-front capital investment needs as they reach 
commercialization. The energy and materials industries 
have seen a relatively high percentage of respondents 
demonstrating that they have at least started experimenting 
with bioengineering. This likely arises from its potential in 
both well-established and nascent use cases—for example, 
improved fermentation processes, bio routes to develop 
novel materials with entirely new properties (for instance, 
alternatives to traditional leather), and broadening biofuels 
production to new feedstock sources. 

Adoption dimensions
Advancements along the following dimensions could enable 
the next level of adoption:

 — continued investments in scientific research and 

development to support bioengineering innovation

 — an increase in regulatory approvals of bioengineering 
innovations across most major economies (currently, 
medicine developed through the use of CRISPR is 
approved in the European Union, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States)

 — improved public perception and broader social 

acceptance of the technologies 

 — a complex infrastructure to support advanced 

bioengineering activities and the ability to scale 
operations and production to meet market demands

The following are real-world examples involving the future of 
bioengineering: 

 — After acquiring Elixirgen Scientific in 2022, Ricoh, a 

Japanese digital-services company, sought to leverage 
its expertise in digital technologies and AI to create 
more reliable disease models, leading to shorter drug 
development timelines and increased success rates. 
Ricoh accordingly entered into a CRISPR/CRISPR-Cas9 
license agreement with ERS Genomics for access to 
gene editing technology patents. The initiative aimed 
to accelerate personalized medicine, drug discovery 
research, and regenerative medicine.

 — Japan became the first country to approve a self-

amplifying mRNA vaccine that instructs the body on how 
to make more mRNA, as trial results have shown signs 
of an increased antibody response relative to traditional 
mRNA boosters. This advance could potentially allow 
for lower effective dosages and a more resilient immune 
response, leading to fewer side effects and longer-
lasting vaccines.

 — Tropic, an agricultural biotech company based in the 
United Kingdom, used CRISPR to genetically modify 
bananas so they stay fresh longer. Conventional 
techniques for creating a genetically engineered 
organism involve the introduction of foreign DNA 
from other organisms, whereas CRISPR offers a 
more targeted and precise approach to gene editing. 
The Philippines Department of Agriculture has since 
classified these bananas as non-GMO and approved 
their production.

 — Insilico Medicine is evaluating its potentially first-in-class 
antifibrotic small-molecule inhibitor on lung function in 
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The 
cause of IPF, a progressive lung disease characterized 
by the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, is unknown, 
which makes it challenging to treat effectively. 
Researchers at Insilico Medicine used a combination 
of machine learning and generative AI to identify a 
new therapeutic molecule to create a compound that 
demonstrated antifibrotic properties. While this process 
usually takes five to eight years, the compound was able 
to progress to human trials in only 18 months. 

 — Unilever announced that it will launch a version of 
its Breyers ice cream that consists of whey protein 
produced by precision fermentation. The company has 
partnered with Perfect Day, a food-tech start-up, to 
produce the whey protein to meet its sustainability goals.

 — Norfolk Plant Sciences released a genetically altered 
purple tomato with high levels of anthocyanins, a type 
of antioxidant shown to have anti-cancer and anti-
inflammatory effects. The company began selling the 
seeds to farmers and gardeners alike, allowing regular 
consumers to “grow biotech” in their own backyard.

Underlying technologies

Advancements in the following technologies will define the 
future of bioengineering:

 — Omics. Biological sciences ending in the suffix “-omics,” 
such as genomics and proteomics, focus on a different 
class of molecule and its functions. Omics are central to 
the development of bioengineering applications such as 
viral-vector gene therapy (which uses modified viruses 
to permanently replace poorly functioning genes that 
cause genetic diseases) and mRNA therapy (which uses 
messenger RNA to trigger the synthesis of proteins that 
can help prevent or fight disease).

a sample of animal cells and growing it in a controlled 
environment to produce tissue that is similar to meat 
from whole animals.

 — Biomaterials. Materials made using bioengineering 
technology are known as biomaterials. They fall 
into several different categories: bio-based drop-in 
chemicals (which can replace chemicals traditionally 
made from petrochemicals without changing 
surrounding operations), bioreplacements (new materials 
made from bio-based chemicals that provide similar 
quality and cost but better environmental performance 
than traditional chemicals), and biobetter materials 
(completely new materials produced via biochemical 
synthesis).

Key uncertainties 

The major uncertainties affecting the future of 
bioengineering include the following:

 — Regulation of bioengineering technology and products 
will play a part in governing the pace of advancements. 

 — Public perceptions and ethical concerns regarding the 
safety, cost, and quality of bioengineered products 
could determine how quickly markets develop. Concerns 
about modifying living organisms could also challenge 
advancements. 

 — Unintended consequences could occur, as biological 

systems are self-replicating, self-sustaining, and highly 
interconnected, and changes to one part of a system 
can have negative cascading effects across an entire 
ecosystem or species.

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider the following 
questions when moving forward with bioengineering 
technologies: 

 — Gene editing. A subset of genomics, gene editing 

 — How will society, in light of its diverse values and 

comprises techniques for modifying an organism’s DNA, 
usually using tools such as CRISPR-Cas9. 

principles, determine an appropriate extent for genome 
editing?

 — Tissue engineering. This technology enables the 
modification of cells, tissues, and organs. Tissue 
engineering supports various human applications, such 
as development of transplantable biomaterials and the 
generation of human tissue replicas for drug studies. 
Cultivated meat is an example of a product produced 
via tissue engineering methods. It is made by taking 

 — In conjunction with business adoption, how will the public 
perceive and adopt bioengineering? For example, how 
does cultivated meat fit within existing diets?

 — How long will it take for a variety of CRISPR-based gene 
therapies to come to fruition and become more socially 
accepted for a range of ailments?

Future of space technologies

The trend—and why it matters

Rapidly decreasing technology costs over the past decade 
have given rise to an increase in the viability and relevance 
of space technologies. Lower costs, attributable to 
reductions in the size, weight, and power needs of satellites 
and launch vehicles, have led to a growing number of 
launches and applications for space technologies. We have 
seen the rise of wide-scale satellite internet connectivity—
pioneered by SpaceX-owned Starlink, with more than 5,000 
low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites—and increased private-
market involvement and innovation around launch vehicles. 
The growing number of use cases has also attracted 

the attention and investment, of non-space-technology 
companies that see a series of opportunities within the 
realms of remote connectivity, Earth observation across 
a spectrum of frequencies, and more. Revenues of the 
industry’s “backbone”—that is, space hardware and service 
providers—could potentially grow to more than $750 billion 
by 2035, but adoption of different space technologies varies 
widely.1 While some technologies are deployed and scaling 
rapidly, many activities of the future space industry, such as 
space mining and on-orbit manufacturing, are still nascent 
and will have to navigate an array of technological and 
geopolitical hurdles in the coming years.

Latest developments 

Recent developments involving space technologies include 
the following: 

 — LEO satellite communications constellations see 

continued growth. LEO satellite constellations are in 
various stages of planning and deployment, with multiple 
companies launching and deploying constellations for 
commercial and government use. After only a few years 
of commercial operation, Starlink saw rapid growth in 
2023, reaching more than 2.3 million subscribers in over 
60 countries and launching new satellites into orbit every 
few days.2 Potential competitors, such as Amazon’s 
Project Kuiper, are testing their products in hopes of 
introducing commercial service soon. 

 — Interest and expected expansion of direct-to-device 

connection continues. Following Apple’s release of its 
direct-to-device (D2D) emergency connection on its 
iPhone, companies have increased their focus on the 
technology to broaden their coverage to remote areas. 
SpaceX has completed successful tests in partnership 
with T-Mobile.  Viasat and Skylo announced the world’s 
first global D2D network with industries such as 
agriculture, mining, and logistics as target customers.

 — Global launch activity increased. Excitement and 

attention about launches continued in 2023, with an 
estimated 223 attempted launches versus 186 in 2022, 
a 20 percent increase.3 Most of these launches are from 
US-based companies, primarily SpaceX. However, there 
was a significant uptick in activity from other countries, 
such as France and India, as they are starting to invest 
more in space exploration and involvement. The debut 
of Vulcan Centaur—a new methane-fueled rocket from 
United Launch Alliance—in early 2024 marked the 

beginning of two certification missions, adding a new 
launch alternative to the market. 

 — Lunar activity continued within the private and public 

sectors. In January 2024, Japan successfully completed 
the country’s first and the world’s most precise moon 
landing ever. This event represents the expanded 
interest in lunar landings across geographies between 
the private and public spheres. A series of private 
companies, such as Astrobotic Technology and Intuitive 
Machines, have focused heavily on constructing lunar 
landers, with Intuitive Machines’ Odysseus managing 
to land the first US spacecraft on the moon since 1972. 
NASA has recently selected Intuitive Machines, along 
with Lunar Outpost and Venturi Astrolab, to advance 
capabilities for the lunar terrain vehicle for Artemis 
astronauts, enabling them to conduct scientific research 
on the moon and prepare for future Mars missions.4 

 — Integration of offerings into end-to-end solutions is 

driven by increased interest from non-space-technology 
sectors. Space technology companies are increasingly 
focusing on providing end-to-end (E2E) solutions as the 
market matures and customers, particularly enterprises, 
demand seamless integration with their existing 
infrastructure and less complexity with implementation. 
We see this through single partnerships between space 
tech companies (such as those offering D2D technology 
or remote sensing analytics) and enterprises in industries 
such as mining, agriculture, and sustainability that are 
seeking both hardware and software solutions. For 
example, Planet Labs has contracts with Swiss Re and 
other insurers to use their satellites and software to both 
observe and provide analytics to support parametric 
agriculture insurance.5

‘Space continues to accelerate in the public 
consciousness, yet adoption is uneven, and funding 
is increasingly flowing to “winners.” Real progress is 
being made to deliver on the promises of 2020–21.’

Adoption developments across the globe

In real life 

Space technology tools are more specific to some 
industries and, therefore, experience relatively low levels 
of reported adoption across the broader market. Perhaps 
unsurprisingly, respondents from energy and materials and 
telecommunications, media, and technology companies 
self-reported that they are scaling or have fully scaled more 
than other industries, owing to how central connectivity and 
remote sensing are to these sectors. 

Adoption dimensions
The adoption trajectory for advanced technologies varies for 
each technology and each use case within that technology. 
Advancements along the following dimensions could enable 
the next level of adoption:

 — Technological evolution  facilitates easier access and 

harmonization of space data and creates opportunities for 
new revenue streams to emerge. Improved accessibility 
and usability enable non-space-technology commercial 
players to embrace space data, breaking down technical 
barriers and fostering innovative use cases.

 — Demand increase—for instance, through regulatory 
requirements for observation of key metrics—could 
be accomplished by space-based remote sensing in a 
broader range of verticals. Substantial legislation where 
third-party verification of emissions is either required or 
beneficial, such as the EU Deforestation Regulation, can 
create incentives for enterprises to use space-based 
technologies to monitor their environmental impact. 
Growth in demand is also enabled by an increasingly 
connected and mobile world, generating demand for 
satellite internet, positioning, and navigation services, 
and AI- and machine learning–powered insights for 
various applications, including disaster response and 
early trendspotting.

 — Considerable decrease of implementation costs for 
companies, aided by further E2E integration of data, 
hardware, software, and science-based methods would 
enable more enterprises to access the technology, 
integrating not only satellite data but also other relevant 
insights. For example, it can help in the sustainability 
field, with certifiable Scope 3 emissions calculations or 
certification needs.

Real-world examples involving the use of space 
technologies include the following:

 — John Deere formed a commercial partnership with 
SpaceX’s Starlink to bring D2D connectivity to its 
agricultural machinery. This will allow new features 
on new and existing machines, such as real-time data 
sharing, enhanced self-repair options (for example, 
connected support and software updates), and 
machine-to-machine communication for farmers in 
remote locations.6  

 — Qatar Airways announced that it will begin installing 
Starlink on select planes for passenger Wi-Fi. The 
company claims that customers will be able to achieve 
speeds of up to 350 megabits per second, which is 
faster than in many homes in North America.7 Other 
airlines incorporating Starlink include JSX, Hawaiian 
Airlines, airBaltic, and ZIPAIR. 

 — India successfully landed its Chandrayaan-3 lunar lander 
on the moon in August 2023. This makes India the fourth 
nation to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon8 
and the first to land on the unexplored south side.9 

 — With the International Space Station currently slated 
to be retired around late 2030, several commercial 
companies are vying to build and operate LEO space 
stations.

 — The Australian government enlisted the geospatial-
analytics company HawkEye 360 to use its remote-
sensing satellites and radio-frequency data analytics 
on a pilot program to detect and prevent illegal and 
unregulated fishing activity in the Pacific Islands. 
HawkEye 360 operates a constellation of 21 satellites, 
with plans to expand to 60 satellites by 2025.10 

 — Nanosatellite start-up Fleet Space Technologies 

purchased equity in mineral exploration company Thor 
Energy after raising $33 million in its Series C round 
in mid-2023. Together, the companies will perform 
mineral exploration tests using Fleet Space’s ExoSphere 
technology, which uses their satellites and seismic  
array technologies to create 3D models of mineral 
exploration sites.

‘For so long, space has been fascinating yet far from 
reality. But now, it is one of the biggest influences 
on our daily lives—from guiding us on our daily 
commutes to facilitating disaster relief operations. 
Space technologies enable impact on Earth.’  

– Giacomo Gatto, partner, London

Underlying technologies

Foundational space technologies include the following:

 — Small satellites. Modular small satellites can be custom 
built—by using CubeSat architectures and standard-
size building blocks—to perform a widening variety of 
missions.

 — Remote sensing. Full-spectrum imaging and monitoring 

are used to observe Earth’s features, such as 
oceanography, weather, and geology.

 — SWaP-C advancements. Reductions in the size, weight, 
power, and cost (SWaP-C) of satellites and launch 
vehicles have increased the cost-effectiveness of space 
technology and associated use cases.

 — Launch technology advancements. Technology 

advancements (for example, computer-aided design 
and material sciences), the reuse of booster structures 
and engines, the advent of new lower-cost heavy launch 
vehicles, and the increases in launch rates are opening 
access to space. We see potential for more advanced 
launch technologies, such as nuclear propulsion. 

 — Advanced-connectivity technologies. These 

technologies, including laser communications, 
electronically scanned antennas, and automated 
satellite operations, are expected to progress in the 
coming years. 

Key uncertainties

The major uncertainties affecting the future of space 
technologies include the following:

 — Cost-effectiveness of space technologies is required to 

enable further scalability. 

 — Governance mechanisms need to better define 

the allocation of spectrum and orbit usage rights 
to accommodate the increasing number of players, 
satellites, and applications.

 — Cyber risks, including data breaches, malware, and other 
cyberattacks, are growing in number and complexity 
because of the proliferation of commercial players.

Big questions about the future

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with space technologies: 

 — How can leaders define ownership and access rights to 

space and space technologies?

 — How can the industry build governance structures 

around key domains (for example, reducing unintentional 
interference, promoting safe operations, protecting 
property rights and usage, determining liability, and 
encouraging equitable data sharing)?

 — How can stakeholders coordinate to manage space 

debris and traffic effectively?

 — What will future satellite distribution look like (for 

example, balance across orbits)?

 — How will the market evolve, given a variety of factors 

(macroeconomic, the push for E2E solutions, et cetera)?

 — How will competition evolve, within the private-launch 

market?

 — With increasing competition and the risk of interference 

and gridlock in spectrum usage, could the current 
spectrum allocation system endure?

Electrification and renewables

The trend—and why it matters

Electrification and renewable-energy technologies are crucial 
for reducing global carbon emissions in accordance with the 
Paris Agreement. Achieving the agreement’s goals requires a 
45 percent reduction in global emissions by 2030 and net-zero 
emissions by 2050.1 

Fortunately, many of the technologies required to achieve these 
reductions already exist today and encompass the entire value 
chain of energy production, storage, and distribution. These 
increasingly important solutions include renewable sources 
such as solar and wind power; clean firm-energy sources such 
as nuclear and hydrogen, sustainable fuels and bioenergy, and 
energy storage; and distribution solutions such as long-duration 
battery systems and smart grids.

The shift to clean energy will have far-reaching effects on both 
energy-producing and energy-intensive sectors, and it will require 
substantial investments in physical assets for energy and land- 
use systems. So far, the total investment in physical assets for 
energy and land-use systems is still well below the $9.2 trillion 
annual investment required to reach net zero by 2050.2 While 
capacity, reliability constraints, and rising interest rates could 
slow the uptake of clean energy, growing capital spending can 
help accelerate adoption. Increased government support on 
infrastructure and permitting could likely accelerate adoption as 
well. As these technologies become more widespread, closing the 
talent gap will also be critical: McKinsey research estimates that 
climate technology value chains will require approximately 200 
million skilled workers globally by 2050.3

Latest developments in 2023

Recent developments involving electrification and 
renewables include the following:

 — Renewable generation grows amid challenges. Despite 
high interest rates and an increased focus on energy 
security, particularly in Europe, 2023 was a record 
year for renewable-capacity installation. An estimated 
50 percent more renewable-generation capacity 
(totaling 507 gigawatts) was added globally compared 
with 2022.4 This rapid deployment was underscored 
at COP28, where countries committed to tripling 
renewable-energy capacity and doubling energy 
efficiency by 2030.5  Utilities for Net Zero Alliance 
(UNEZA), an international platform for cooperation in 
power and utilities, confirmed the difficulty of achieving 
that goal without grid buildout. Further innovation, 
government support, and funding, particularly for 
emerging economies, will be necessary to continue 
the momentum toward global decarbonization by 
2050, especially considering that emissions and gas 
consumption were at all-time highs in 2023.

 — Public sector support for hydrogen increases, but 
implementation still lags. Green hydrogen remains 
an important piece of the clean-energy puzzle—for 
example, hydrogen is used in processes such as 
hydrocracking or hydrotreating at refineries. Recent 
incentives such as the US Clean Hydrogen Production 
Tax Credit, the EU Important Projects of Common 
European Interest, and the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen 
Agreement demonstrate growing interest in public 
sector support for advancing the green-hydrogen 
ecosystem and ultimately allow for economies of 
scale despite existing cost barriers.6 Despite the new 
incentives, private sector hydrogen adoption remains 
relatively small, with only 1.0 percent of global production 
(and 0.7 percent of demand in existing applications) 
coming from low-emission hydrogen.7 Factors 
contributing to slow adoption include the challenge to 

balance clean-hydrogen production with the growing 
demand for power, the high-interest-rate environment, 
and incentives that mainly target new applications 
instead of scaling existing uses. 

 — Global battery storage capacity is scaling rapidly. In 
2023, lithium-ion battery pack prices dropped by 14 
percent and are expected to decline further in 2024, 
with demand for mobile and stationary battery storage 
increasing by more than 50 percent year over year.8  
McKinsey analysis projects that demand for lithium-ion 
batteries will scale up to six times to 4,700 gigawatt-
hours by 2030, with mobility applications encompassing 
a vast majority of the market.9 Established policy 
incentives, including Europe’s Fit for 55 program, the 
US Inflation Reduction Act, the European Union’s 2035 
ban on internal-combustion-engine vehicles, and 
India’s scheme for faster adoption and manufacture of 
hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs), demonstrate 
public sector interest in continued EV adoption. 
However, widespread adoption of EVs will likely 
hinge on the expansion of charging infrastructure, as 
well as improvements in mileage and performance. 
Innovations such as solid-state batteries, which promise 
significant enhancements, are still years away from 
commercialization. 

 — Policy incentives look to spur stalled heat pump 
adoption. In 2023, global heat pump installations 
declined (approximately 3 percent) from their peak at 
111 gigawatts in 2022,10 with a 17 percent decline in the 
United States alone.11 While studies have shown that 
heat pumps can drive long-run cost and energy savings 
for residential applications, high installation costs and 
variable natural gas prices have created a hesitancy in 
further consumer adoption.12 However, existing  
subsidies for heat pump installation throughout the 
European Union13 and new tax credits in 2023–24 
through the US Inflation Reduction Act14 could look to 
reinvigorate demand.

Adoption developments across the globe 

In real life

More than 40 percent of survey respondents self-reported 
that they already are piloting, are scaling, or have fully scaled 
their electrification and renewable-energy technologies. 
Energy and materials and technology companies showed 
the greatest adoption across industries, indicating the 
significant impact electrification and renewables will have 
throughout the energy value chain. 

Adoption dimensions
Advancements along the following dimensions could enable 
the next level of adoption:

 — Further adoption of electrification and renewable-

energy technologies depends on reducing costs, which 
can be achieved through tech advances and investments 
to scale. Material efficiency will then become more 
relevant, since the supply of materials such as lithium, 
steel, and copper could become constraints if the speed 
of low-carbon energy generation increases to the levels 
required to keep pace with global net-zero commitments.

 — The future energy mix may involve ramping up 

infrastructure development for production of emerging 
technologies such as green hydrogen, batteries, and 
sustainable fuels.

 — Accelerating innovation and investment in infrastructure 
for power transmission and distribution, battery storage, 
EV charging, and smart-grid load management can 
facilitate the clean-energy transition. Streamlined 
permitting processes can reduce project lead times and 
facilitate rapid scale-up.

 — Deploying electrification and renewable-energy 

technologies at the speed and scale required for global 
decarbonization commitments could be achieved 
through a step-change increase in the supply of clean-
energy technology professionals.

 — Cross-regional collaboration can help harmonize 

standards, accelerate the global adoption of renewable-
energy technologies, and align on global energy security 
policies.

Real-world examples involving the use of electrification and 
renewables include the following:

 — Aira is a Swedish-founded, UK-based clean-energy 
technology company disrupting the European heat 
pump market with a vertically integrated, subscription-
based business model. The company overcomes 
consumer concerns about navigating complex regulation 
and high installation costs by providing end-to-end 
customer support through home energy assessments, 
grant application assistance, installation, and lifetime 
system maintenance while spreading up-front costs 
over monthly installments. Aira heat pumps can be fully 
controlled using the Aira app and deliver significant 
energy and cost savings. Over the next ten years, the 
company has set the goal of serving five million homes 
with its clean-energy technology solutions. 

 — EV OEMs are forming strategic partnerships to be at the 
forefront of battery technology. Stellantis has made an 
investment in Lyten to accelerate the commercialization 
of 3D Graphene applications to lithium–sulfur EV battery 
technology. The technology produces lithium–sulfur 
batteries without using nickel, cobalt, or manganese, 
which could potentially result in an estimated 60 percent 
lower carbon footprint than current best-in-class 
batteries.15 The rate of innovation for lithium–graphene 
batteries is spurred by a rapid increase in related patent 
filings.16 Adoption potential is significantly boosted by 
anticipated decreases in graphene costs as production 
scales up, making these advanced batteries more 
economically viable for broader markets.

 — Cloud hyperscalers are investing heavily in renewable 
energy. For example, Amazon directly invested in more 
than 100 new renewable-energy projects in 2023, 
increasing its total portfolio to over 500 projects 
globally, with a total installed generation capacity of 
more than 77,000 gigawatt-hours per year.17

Underlying technologies

Foundational technologies in electrification and renewables 
include the following: 

 — Batteries. These devices store chemical energy 

and convert it into electricity. They are applicable to 
traditional energy sources as well as renewables such as 
wind and solar.

 — Heat pumps. These devices extract heat from a source 
(that is, from air, ground, or water) and transfer that heat 
from evaporator to condenser, proving to be 2.0 to 4.5 
times more efficient than a traditional furnace or boiler.18  
They also function as air conditioners, transferring heat 
from internal spaces to outside.

offshore wind turbines are driving significant growth 
from traditional renewable sources.

 — Hydrogen. This is a versatile energy carrier that can be 
produced with minimal or zero-carbon emissions using 
electrochemical energy conversion technologies.

 — Sustainable fuels. These are fuel alternatives to 

traditional fossil hydrocarbon fuels, including both low-
carbon fuels and fuels derived from natural or alternative 
feedstock (for example, biomass, hydrogen, e-ammonia, 
and e-methanol-based fuels). 

Opportunities to leverage other tech trends with 
electrification and renewables technologies include the 
following: 

 — Energy storage. These technologies, including 

 — Future of mobility. There are expanded applications 

batteries, capture energy from various sources, such 
as electrochemical, thermal, mechanical, and chemical 
systems, to be used later.19 

of electrification and renewables in transportation; for 
example, innovative battery technologies can transform 
micromobility applications. 

 — Nuclear fission. Nuclear fission, the process of splitting 
large atoms to create energy, is a proven zero-carbon 
power source. Concerns about accidents and radioactive 
waste persist. However, the growing demand for clean 
energy is reinvigorating efforts to expand nuclear power 
capabilities. (There is also growing interest in nuclear 
fusion, the process of combining small atoms to produce 
energy, but significant technical challenges remain to be 
solved.)

 — Renewables. These are energy sources produced by 
natural power resources. New technologies such as 
advanced solar photovoltaics and both onshore and 

 — Applied AI. Real-time smart-grid monitoring enables 
dynamic energy pricing models and more efficient 
charging.

 — Industrialized machine learning. Predicting green-

hydrogen production potential from organic waste can 
enhance efficacy and yield. 

 — Immersive reality. Blueprints combined with augmented 
reality headsets could allow heat pump installers to see 
necessary ductwork changes and installation steps.

‘The technologies that enable the transition to clean 
energy are critical to delivering approximately 
50 percent of the required solution for net zero. 
Acceleration of these technologies is critically 
important. Above all, we need ambition to accelerate 
the transition.’

Key uncertainties affecting the trend 

Big questions about the future

The major uncertainties affecting electrification and 
renewables include the following: 

 — Concerns exist about the high costs of scaling 

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with electrification and 
renewables: 

renewables, generating clean firm power, and supporting 
infrastructure. 

 — How will innovations in battery storage technology 

influence the adoption of EVs and renewable assets?

 — Balancing necessary transmission and distribution 

investments with uncertain adoption timelines for EVs, 
heat pumps, and other electrification technology could 
create challenges for efficient capital deployment. 

 — Government climate policies and regulation can 

dramatically alter the timeline of climate technology 
adoption.  

 — Reskilling and transitioning skilled labor from legacy 
industries to electrification and renewables will be a 
massive workforce challenge but could also present an 
incredible opportunity for inclusive job growth around 
the world. 

 — How can public–private stakeholders collaborate to 
manage existing and emerging energy systems in 
parallel while ensuring energy security and grid stability?  

 — How will regions and organizations leverage the new 
comparative advantages brought on by an electrified 
world while increasing energy access and ensuring job 
security for employees of legacy industries? 

 — How will the power sector increase the talent pool 
of workers with skills specific to electrification and 
renewable-energy technology? 

 — Will emerging economies choose to supply growing 
populations with clean energy despite existing 
infrastructure hurdles20 and cost competition from 
hydrocarbons?21 

‘Scaling renewables and electrification technologies 
requires cost reductions, substantial investments, and 
talent. Despite challenges, 2023 marked significant 
strides in renewables, battery storage, and hydrogen 
support. However, cost competitiveness, raw materials, 
manufacturing capacity, labor transition, and 
infrastructure remain hurdles to leaping ahead.’

Climate technologies beyond electrification  
and renewables

The trend—and why it matters

Climate technologies beyond electrification and renewables 
cover technologies related to circularity and resources and 
carbon capture and removal. The production of sustainable 
goods and services can support companies in terms of complying 
with emerging regulations, creating growth opportunities, and 
attracting talent. While many technologies that mitigate the 
environmental impact of consumption are technically viable, 
few have become cost-effective enough—or have overcome 
other hurdles, such as labor upskilling and funding—to achieve 
mass scale. The scope of the challenge is also unprecedented: 

according to some estimates, an additional removal capacity of 
0.8 to 2.9 metric gigatons of CO2 per year is required by 2030 
(to be on the pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050)—three 
to ten times more than the volumes currently estimated to be 
onstream by that date.1 However, opportunities for innovators to 
capture value through scale are apparent, since a carbon removal 
market capable of enabling gigaton-scale removals at net-zero 
levels could be worth up to $1.2 trillion by 2050.2 To close the 
gap between aspirations and commitments, a step change in 
investment equal to about 0.1 percent of global annual GDP (about 
$120 billion) could be necessary.3

Latest developments in 2023

Recent developments involving climate technologies 
beyond electrification and renewables include the following:

 — Companies are expanding their commitments. This 

is evidenced by a moderate increase in targets across 
various dimensions and a more notable surge in 
corporate climate commitments. Currently, about 80 
percent of companies in the Fortune Global 500 have 
set carbon reduction targets. Beyond carbon, the 
dimensions attracting the most attention include water, 
chemicals and plastic, biodiversity, and forests. The year 
2023 witnessed a 30 percent year-over-year increase 
in the number of companies setting targets in three or 
more dimensions of nature (for example, air, water, land).4  
Europe has the greatest share of companies with nature 
targets, likely galvanized by a set of nature-related 
regulations, including the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive, EU Deforestation Regulation, and—
most recently—the EU Nature Restoration Law. Similar 
public sector action in other regions could encourage 
companies in all sectors to implement nature-positive 
levers with opportunities for an annual net benefit of up 
to $700 billion.5  

 — The adoption of agriculture technology (agtech) 

solutions for sustainable farming is growing, though 
penetration is currently relatively low. While sustainable 
agricultural practices that require behavior change 
(such as cover crops and afforestation of degraded 
cropland) have the highest adoption, practices that 
leverage technology and require a product or equipment 
change are not adopted at full scale yet, according to 
the latest US farmer survey.6 However, we see advances 
in these agtech solutions. For example, variable-rate 
fertilizer applications (VRA) benefit from advances in 
AI to generate high-precision VRA maps to account 
for field variability. This can help reduce the amount of 
fertilizer applied, which, in turn, reduces greenhouse 
gas emissions caused by excess nitrogen. Similarly, 
weed control robots are advancing and allow for 
the reduction of tillage and herbicide applications, 
which benefits carbon sequestration and reduces 
water pollution. Satellite-enabled remote-sensing 
technologies help to assess reduced tillage, sustainable 
practices for cover crops, and plant health. Further 
adoption of these technologies requires helping farmers 

overcome operational challenges and the risks that 
new technologies might entail—for example, through 
insurance and the promotion of potential yield, cost, and 
revenue benefits (such as carbon credits).

 — Public sector support for carbon management initiatives 
is increasing. Government agencies across the globe are 
leveraging a number of instruments, including grants, 
regulations, and tax breaks, to support the development 
and adoption of carbon management technologies. 
For example, in addition to other investments, the US 
Department of Energy recently awarded $13 million 
in funding to 23 projects focused on R&D in carbon 
capture through the Office of Fossil Energy and 
Carbon Management.7 This funding aims to support 
innovative solutions and advancements in carbon 
capture technologies. Furthermore, the US Department 
of Energy has allocated up to $1.2 billion, through the 
Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, to support two 
direct air capture (DAC) projects in Louisiana and Texas.8 
These DAC hubs could play a crucial role in developing 
and demonstrating large-scale carbon removal 
technologies. These initiatives from the Department of 
Energy may indicate a significant focus on addressing 
carbon management challenges and accelerating the 
development of sustainable solutions in the fight against 
climate change.

 — Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) has seen 
a step change in interest. In the past year, the global 
CCUS market has seen a step change in interest. If all 
announced projects in the pipeline are realized by 2030, 
current capacity could increase by 12 times.9 However, 
many of these projects still need confirmed funding and 
final decisions on executing the buildout. This projected 
increase in interest coincides with a proliferation of 
CCUS start-ups, new technologies, and private sector 
interest in forward agreements and long-term carbon 
offtakes. These agreements allow developers to 
finance CCUS infrastructure more easily, since they can 
demonstrate proof of an existing customer base prior to 
construction. Such market dynamics are encouraging 
signs for global net-zero ambitions, considering the 
expectation that CCUS capacity needs are expected to 
increase by over 100 times by 2050.

Adoption developments across the globe

In real life 

Adoption levels for climate technologies beyond 
electrification and renewables currently sit in the middle of 
all our trends, with over 50 percent of companies reporting 
they have invested in the trend. As these technologies move 
down the cost curve, adoption is expected to increase. 
Respondents from energy and materials companies self-
reported the greatest level of progress toward scaling 
capabilities, given the high relevance of circular-technology 
applications and carbon management to several industries 
within the sector.

Adoption dimensions 
Climate technologies beyond electrification and renewables 
are diverse, each having unique development timelines 
and use cases. The adoption trajectory for advanced 
technologies will look different for each technology and 
each use case within that technology. Advancements along 
the following dimensions could enable the next level of 
adoption for these technologies: 

 — scaling of circular technologies, which require 

collaboration across the supply chain to administer 
collection, recycling, and reintroduction into the value 
chain

 — regulatory clarity to promote investor and consumer 
confidence in alternative proteins and near-term 
innovation to maximize flavor and decrease costs for 
the many emerging alternatives that are still at the 
precommercial stage 

 — increased trust in and broader recognition of carbon 

abatement and removal schemes, including increased 
valuation of the environmental and human health 
cobenefits from nature-based carbon removal

 — lower unit costs for measurable carbon abatement and 
removal projects, as well as for products and materials 
with low-carbon equivalents 

 — accelerated deployment of carbon capture and storage 
technologies to be achieved by enhancing funding, 
research, and international collaborations to improve 
feasibility and scalability

 — pursuing net-zero or nature-positive operations over 
an extended time horizon, which requires an enduring 
ambition

Real-world examples involving the use of climate 
technologies beyond electrification and renewables include 
the following:

 — The circularity solution led by Schneider Electric, a digital 
automation and energy management company, shows 
an example of how end-to-end operations can be set up 
in a circular approach. Through ecodesign, waste-to-
resources sites, and a global network of refurbishment 
centers, this IoT-enabled architecture and platform has 
helped its customers to avoid more than 500 million 
metric tons of CO2 since 2018 and to use 27 percent 
green material content across products.10 

 — A group of investors, including Equinor and 

TotalEnergies, partnered on the first phase of the 
Northern Lights project, a first-of-its-kind carbon 
capture and storage infrastructure open to third-party 
industrial emitters. The program will facilitate the 
transportation and permanent storage of liquefied CO2 
from the European continent to the reservoirs beneath 
the North Sea. Infrastructure completion and initial 
deliveries are on track for 2024.11 

 — Running Tide is an ocean health company that 

processes, quantifies, and provides carbon credits 
through ocean-based, natural climate solutions. 
The company uses two main carbon sequestration 
techniques—terrestrial biomass sinking and ocean 
alkalinity enhancement—to capture and store oceanic 
carbon. It then quantifies carbon removal, using in situ 
measurements, lab testing, and sophisticated ocean 
models to offer accredited carbon credits with high 
confidence in sequestration permanence. To date, the 
company has removed over 25,000 metric tons of CO2 
equivalent and sold about 22,000 carbon credits.12  

 — Among other agricultural and food companies, Cargill 
expanded its existing sustainable agriculture program, 
Cargill RegenConnect, to four European countries 
(France, Germany, Poland, and Romania). The program 
pays farmers to adopt agricultural techniques that 
pull carbon from the atmosphere into the soil—such 
as cover cropping and no-till farming—based on the

Underlying technologies

There are varieties of climate technologies beyond 
electrification and renewables: 

 — Circular technologies. Design and production techniques 
and engineered materials can increase recycling and 
reuse and minimize waste.

 — Natural climate solutions. Nature-based projects 

can remove carbon or prevent emissions from being 
produced. Those can include terrestrial ecosystems 
(for example, afforestation), peatland restoration, fire 
management, and agricultural management (such as 
through optimizing grazing pathways and cover crops). 

 — Alternative proteins. These proteins can be produced 

from natural sources with significantly fewer emissions 
than animal proteins. These sources include plants  
(for instance, soybeans, wheat), microorganisms (such  
as through microbial fermentation), and cultivated  
animal cells. 

 — CCUS. CO2 can be captured—before being emitted 

into the atmosphere—typically directly from the point 
of production, such as at industrial facilities and power 
plants that use fossil fuels. The utilization of CO₂ and its 

sale as a product offer a revenue source to offset  
the cost of capture. One of the primary uses of CO₂  
today is enhanced oil recovery; other uses also are 
gaining momentum.14 

 — Engineered carbon removal. Various technologies can 

remove atmospheric CO2, including direct air capture and 
storage, bioenergy carbon capture and storage, biochar 
and bio-oil, and enhanced weathering. 

Opportunities for the integration of climate technologies 
beyond electrification and renewables with other tech 
trends include the following:

 — Applied AI. AI technologies can be used to increase the 
efficacy and efficiency of carbon capture systems.

 — Advanced connectivity. Advanced connectivity can 
improve real-time crop monitoring and automated  
micro-irrigation.

 — Future of bioengineering. Bioengineering can help in  
the development of genetically modified varieties of 
trees, crops, and seaweed that absorb more carbon with 
fewer inputs.

 — Future of space technologies. More advanced satellites 
can monitor CO2 concentrations and soil and ocean 
health and validate, quantify, and authenticate carbon 
management schemes. 

‘Carbon management technologies to reduce and 
remove carbon from the atmosphere will be an 
essential part of the world’s journey to net zero. 
Creating a gigaton-carbon-management industry in a 
few short decades to meet the climatic need presents an 
enormous challenge and an exciting opportunity for 
innovators, investors, and policy makers alike.’

Key uncertainties affecting the trend 

Big questions about the future

The major uncertainties affecting climate technologies 
beyond electrification and renewables include the following:

 — Public sector incentives such as potential policies and 
regulations could be pivotal in shaping investment 
decisions, business case viability, and public reactions to 
carbon management schemes. 

 — Natural-capital valuation through different carbon 

management incentive structures allows organizations 
to apply varying valuations for the cobenefits of natural-
capital solutions, relative to pure CO2 removal. 

 — Coordination throughout the value chain could be a 
challenge, as scaling carbon abatement and removal 
infrastructure is time and capital intensive. The need for 
coordination between public and private stakeholders at 
the local level could be an additional obstacle.

 — Standardization of the carbon market could prove 

difficult, as it is unclear how recent commitments by 
independent carbon credit standards to enhance 
transparency and consistency will affect trust in carbon 
management schemes to follow through on promises. 

Companies and leaders may want to consider a few 
questions when moving forward with climate technologies 
beyond electrification and renewables:

 — How will carbon management schemes overcome 

potential bottlenecks (for instance, raw materials, land, 
and infrastructure) as R&D, experience, and economies 
of scale help propel adoption?

 — How will debates about the efficacy of nature-based 
carbon removals compared with technology-based 
carbon removals affect investment decisions and public 
perception? 

 — Can innovations in CCUS technologies lead to significant 

cost reductions and expanded use cases? 

 — Can independent carbon credit agencies successfully 

meet certification criteria and increase scoring 
transparency to build trust and reliability in the voluntary 
carbon market? 

 — How will consumers react to the continued innovations in 

alternative proteins?

‘Nature is the technology that we have available today 
for the next critical decade and can help solve the net-
zero equation. If you want to think about a cost-effective 
way of capturing carbon or avoiding carbon loss today, 
it is through natural systems. And nature’s import goes 
far beyond its role in the climate: let’s not forget we are 
dependent on it for our lives and livelihoods.’  

– Joshua Katz, partner, Stamford
