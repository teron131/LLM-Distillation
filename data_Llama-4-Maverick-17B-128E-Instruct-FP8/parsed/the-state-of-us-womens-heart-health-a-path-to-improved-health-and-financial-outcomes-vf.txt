health and financial outcomes

Closing the cardiovascular-disease gap between men and women could help women 
regain 1.6 million years of life lost because of poor health and early death, and boost the 
US economy by $28 billion annually by 2040.

At a glance

 — Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for women. Cardiovascular conditions in the United 

States make up at least a third of the women’s health gap because of inequities between women and men in care 
delivery, efficacy, and data availability.

 — Addressing heart health at every life stage can improve a woman’s quality of life and overall health. It could lead 
to at least 1.6 million years of higher-quality life and boost the US economy by $28 billion annually by 2040.

 — In the United States, Black women have a higher prevalence of and morbidity from CVD than non-Black  

women do.

In the United States, cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
is the leading cause of death for women. Today, 
more than 60 million women are living with CVD.1 
They’re more likely than men to die from a heart 
attack and to develop heart failure in the five years 
after discharge from the hospital.2

CVD makes up over a third of the health gap 
between US men and women, as measured in 
potential years of healthy life (Exhibit 1). Analysts 
have quantified this gap in terms of disability-
adjusted life years. Building on previous research 
from the McKinsey Health Institute and the World 
Economic Forum on the women’s health gap,3 
additional insights have found that the United States 
has the potential to gain an additional $28 billion 
in GDP by 2040 by closing the gap in heart health 
between men and women.4

Women constitute half of the population, 
workforce, and community and are responsible 
for over 80 percent of a family’s medical decision 
making. Therefore, their well-being plays a pivotal 
role in shaping the overall health of families and 
communities. Enabling women to be healthier sets 
in motion a ripple effect of positive cardiovascular-
health choices in the public, private, and social 

sectors that can lead to a healthier population, 
including for caregivers.5

Addressing women’s heart health and reducing 
CVD risk factors also has potential financial benefits 
for employers. One study estimated that the per-
year price of employee absenteeism costs a large 
employer from around $17,000 for diabetes to more 
than $285,000 for physical inactivity.6

CVD presents differently in women and men. 
Yet a pervasive one-size-fits-all mentality for 
it remains throughout the healthcare delivery 
ecosystem. Research revealed that only 22 percent 
of physicians and 42 percent of cardiologists felt 
extremely well prepared to adequately assess CVD 
specific to women.7

Caring for heart health should be a priority 
throughout a woman’s lifespan, not just at older 
ages when acute symptoms are most prevalent and 
most expected by women themselves. It’s possible 
to address modifiable risk factors and focus on 
prevention before CVD sets in. For example, 
four out of five maternal deaths are preventable. 
Considering that CVD remains the leading cause 
of maternal deaths, this overlap indicates that

data. The women’s health burden reflects conditions that affect women disproportionately or differently than they do men.

mortality, and long-term health.

addressing prevention can lower maternal mortality 
related to CVD.8 The women’s heart health gap in 
the United States is addressable by providing sex- 
and gender-appropriate cardiac care and research. 
This can be supported by investments, innovation, 
education, and public-awareness campaigns.

By addressing the CVD gap between men and 
women in the United States, women could live 
longer and higher-quality lives, potentially regaining 
1.6 million years of life lost because of poor health 
and early deaths.9

Women are biologically different  
from men
A woman’s cardiovascular health is influenced  
by biological factors that are rooted in unique  
life stages. Women and men share many traditional 
risk factors for the development of CVD, such  
as obesity, smoking, and diabetes. But the  
relative impact of these may vary because of 
biological differences and behavioral practices. 
For example, literature suggests that although 
men have a higher prevalence of diabetes than 
women do, the presence of diabetes increases 
cardiovascular risk by three- to sevenfold in 
women, compared with a two- to threefold 
increase in men.10 Men have a higher prevalence

having an acute cardiovascular event.11

Estrogen, a sex hormone, is believed to have a 
protective effect on the heart and may potentially 
explain some of the differences. Estrogen plays 
a role in regulating various metabolic functions, 
such as lipid levels (amounts of fat) in the blood, 
inflammatory markers (contributing to damage to 
vessel walls), and the coagulant system (affecting 
blood clot formation).12 Additionally, estrogen is 
believed to help relax and open up blood vessels 
throughout the body, allowing for better blood flow.

The understanding of biological differences such 
as these has expanded, but major knowledge gaps 
still exist. Heart health—or lack thereof—affects 
not only the cardiovascular system but the whole 
body, including the gastrointestinal, immune, 
musculoskeletal, neurological, pulmonary, and 
renal systems. For example, midlife hypertension 
is associated with an approximately 60 percent 
increased risk of all-cause dementia, and systolic 
hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater 
than 160 millimeters of mercury) is associated with 
an approximately 25 percent increased risk of 
Alzheimer’s disease.13

By 2040, brain health and heart health together 
could contribute to nearly half of the US women’s 
health burden gap (or two million years of life lost 
each year because of poor health or early death).14 
Improving brain health and heart health together 
could add over $100 billion in annual US GDP by 
2040. Addressing CVD throughout a woman’s 
lifespan can have enormous benefits in both 
cardiovascular health and quality of life at large.

Women go through unique stages of life 
characterized by fluctuating levels of estrogen 
(such as puberty and menopause) and additional 
physiological stress on the body (such as 
pregnancy). With the increasing prevalence of CVD 
in women, novel sex-related risk factors should 
be considered in combination with behavioral, 
environmental, and social factors to guide its early 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in women 
across all stages of life (Exhibit 2).

Adolescence and puberty mark the  
first changes
A woman’s first menstrual period (menarche) usually 
occurs between the ages of 10 and 16, after a 
yearlong rise in daily estrogen output.15 Menstrual 
cycles have been shown to have an impact on a 
woman’s CVD risk later in life.

For one, the age of menarche may play a role in CVD 
risk. A study found that those who had menarche 
earlier than the age of 12 had an increased risk of 
CVD and of some of its associated risk factors, 
such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. 
The mechanisms linking early menarche and CVD 
aren’t fully understood but may be explained in part 
by genetic and lifestyle factors, such as reduced 
physical activity and excess calorie consumption.16

There’s an association between irregular menstrual 
cycles (affecting around 20 percent of women) and 
elevated body mass index, total cholesterol, and 
triglycerides, which may increase the overall risk of 
CVD. Irregular menstrual cycles also independently 
contribute to the increased risk of CVD.17 Potential 
mechanisms by which irregular or prolonged 
menstrual cycles affect cardiovascular health

include decreased estrogen exposure and shared 
risk factors, such as obesity.

There’s ample opportunity for research into better 
understanding the links between menstruation 
and the overall health of a woman. With greater 
knowledge and treatment options, women can 
embark on a lifelong journey to view their heart 
health more holistically.

Pregnancy and childbirth can strain a  
woman’s heart
Pregnancy puts a physiological strain on a woman’s 
body, including on her heart. As early as eight 
weeks into pregnancy, a woman’s body experiences 
multiple changes, including increased blood 
volume and increased cardiac output.18 Beyond 
normal physiological changes during pregnancy, a 
number of pregnancy-specific conditions have been 
associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
found that four out of five maternal deaths in the

of these deaths are CVD (cardiac and coronary 
conditions) (13 percent), thrombotic embolism 
(9 percent), cardiomyopathy (9 percent) and 
hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDPs) 
(7 percent).19 More than half of pregnancy-related 
deaths occur in the year after childbirth. Yet up to 
40 percent of women don’t access postpartum 
care, and only an estimated 18 to 25 percent of 
postpartum patients with pregnancy complications 
are seen by a primary care provider (PCP) within six 
months of delivery.20

Physicians and patients alike must be taught to 
recognize these issues. Helping pregnant women 
holistically, beyond reproductive care, creates a 
vast opportunity to reduce adverse outcomes for 
mothers and babies. It may also reduce modifiable 
risk factors for CVD before it’s too late.

Pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders
HDPs affect up to 10 percent of pregnant women in 
the US and are the cause of 7 percent of maternal 
deaths.21 HDPs include gestational hypertension 
(new-onset hypertension of 140 over 90 millimeters 
of mercury after 20 weeks’ gestation in a previously 
normotensive woman), chronic hypertension 
(hypertension before 20 weeks’ gestation), and 
preeclampsia. Women who develop HDPs in 
their first pregnancy are at an increased risk of 
recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. They are 
also at a higher risk of developing hypertension, 
stroke, and ischemic heart disease in later life.22

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific condition 
characterized by hypertension after 20 weeks of 

gestation and the presence of proteinuria (protein 
in the urine) and/or end-organ dysfunction.23 The 
mechanism of preeclampsia isn’t fully understood, 
and the only definitive cure for the condition is the 
delivery of the fetus and the placenta.24

Women with preeclampsia have a fourfold relative 
risk of developing hypertension later in life, a 
twofold risk for ischemic heart disease, a twofold 
relative risk of stroke, and a twofold relative 
risk for venous thromboembolism (Exhibit 3).25 
Furthermore, the severity of preeclampsia and its 
earlier onset are correlated with the severity of CVD 
later in life.

Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes is a pregnancy-specific 
condition defined as newly diagnosed diabetes 
mellitus beyond the first trimester of pregnancy. 
This condition affects up to 14 percent of 
pregnancies around the world.26 Gestational 
diabetes not only increases the risk of developing 
type 2 diabetes by sevenfold but also independently 
raises CVD risk (twofold for stroke and fourfold for 
myocardial infarction) later in life.27

Peripartum cardiomyopathy
Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a pregnancy-specific 
condition without a reversible cause. It presents 
near the end of pregnancy or in the postpartum 
period in a woman without known heart disease.28 
Although relatively rare (incidence of one in 1,000 
to 4,000 US live births), it can carry a high mortality 
of up to 11 percent in the United States, as shown 
in a longer-term follow-up study of patients in 
Midwestern academic centers.29

Menopause symptoms may play a role  
in hypertension
Menopause is a natural part of a woman’s biological 
aging characterized by the end of the menstrual 
cycle and reduced estrogen and progesterone. It 
typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. 
CVD is more common in postmenopausal women 
than in similarly aged men, though this isn’t the case 
prior to menopause.30 Women between the ages of 
45 and 65 (around menopausal transition) have the 
greatest rise in the prevalence of hypertension, yet 
more research is needed to understand why.31

Up to 80 percent of women may experience 
common menopausal symptoms, such as hot 
flashes and night sweats. These vasomotor 
symptoms (VMS) may play a role in hypertension and 
increased CVD risk. A study showed that women 
with frequent VMS associated with menopause had 
a 77 percent higher risk of developing CVD than did 
women with no or less-frequent VMS.32

CVD disproportionately affects women  
of color
When examining women’s cardiovascular health, 
statistics show how race and ethnicity can also 
affect women’s healthcare experience. From initial 
diagnosis to treatment outcomes, women of color 
often face disparities in care. While some progress 
has been made, substantial opportunities to 
address these inequities remain.

In the United States, 59 percent of Black women 
over the age of 20 have some form of CVD, 
compared with 43 percent of Hispanic American 
women, 43 percent of Asian American women, and 
42 percent of White women (Exhibit 4).33 American 
Indian and Native Alaskan women have a prevalence 
of type 2 diabetes—up to 72 percent in some 
communities—that’s three times higher than that of 
White American women.34

Despite having a high prevalence of CVD, persons 
of African, Hispanic, or Indigenous descent are 
underrepresented and underreported in US clinical 
trials.35 Women of color sit at the intersection

of both low representation of women and low 
representation of non-White races and ethnicities in 
clinical trials, making their representation in clinical 
trials even more pertinent.

Black women are at a significantly higher risk than 
White women of developing CVD during pregnancy, 
having preterm deliveries, and delivering low-
birth-weight infants, and they have the highest 
postpartum CVD risk, even when adjusted for 
socioeconomic status.36 In the United States, the 
incidence of preeclampsia is 60 percent higher in 
Black women than in White women.37 Additionally, 
Black women face more adverse outcomes related 
to the condition, including kidney damage and 
mortality.38 American Indian and Native Alaskan 
women have the highest mortality from peripartum 
cardiomyopathy (14.5 percent) out of all US ethnic 
and race groups.

The reasons for these discrepancies are 
multifactorial and include structural inequalities and 
health-related social needs. Addressing biases, 
providing differential training for those serving 
these communities, and offering tailored healthcare 
delivery models that address specific communities 
would create more equity in care delivery for women 
of color.

Cardiovascular research often 
underrepresents women, resulting in  
subpar treatment outcomes
Basic research, including in animal models, 
often excludes female subjects. One examined 
compilation of studies published from 2006 to 2016 
that focused on preclinical cardiovascular research 
discovered that the sex of the animals used wasn’t 
disclosed in 20 percent of the studies.39 Among

The state of US women’s heart health: A path to improved health and financial outcomesthe studies that did report the sex, only males were 
used in 72 percent of cases, only females were used 
in 13 percent of cases, and both sexes were used in 
16 percent of cases. Many researchers believe that 
including females may hamper studies because of 
the need for larger sample sizes, the increased cost, 
and the higher variability of female data as a result 
of the estrous cycle.40

Sex should be a consideration as part of initial 
study design, not only as an afterthought when 
outcomes differ. For example, between 1997 
and 2000, the US Food and Drug Administration 
removed ten drugs from the market because of 
adverse events, with one drug noted to have a 
specific cardiovascular intervention.41 Eight of 
those drugs posed greater risks to women than to 
men, and six correlated with comparatively poorer 
cardiovascular outcomes in women.

Despite US Congress passing a law in 1993 that 
required the inclusion of women in clinical research, 
a gender gap remains. A study looking at 740 trials 
in cardiovascular health from 2010 to 2017 found 
that women made up only 38 percent of study 
participants.42 Even after adjusting for prevalence, 
women were underrepresented in trials related to 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS), coronary heart 
disease, and heart failure. Additionally, although 
postmenopausal women are often the ones 
most affected by CVD, they also had the lowest 
study participation rates (26 percent).43 A smaller 
study, looking at 263 studies as recent as 2016 to 
2019, found that women were in slightly less than 
42 percent of cardiovascular studies, although 
49 percent of the female population had CVD.44

The reasons for this are multifactorial, spanning 
systemic barriers, inadequate trial design, and 
participant-specific barriers. First and foremost, 
women need to be asked to participate as routine. 
Trials need to reflect geographies where a diverse 
population of women reside or offer alternative 
means of participation, such as digital engagement.

Furthermore, women often must juggle wage 
earning with more caretaking responsibilities than 
men have. Therefore, it’s important to focus on 
finding ways to lessen the burden of clinical trial 
participation and address the challenges. Examples 
include providing assistance for aspects such as 
travel, transportation, food, eldercare, childcare, 
and other related expenses if visits to the trial sites 
are necessary and advancing the acceptability and 
ease of distributed clinical trials.45

Without enough women participating in trials, 
researchers have limited data on how treatments 
and preventative measures affect the female body, 
especially during transitions that include puberty, 
pregnancy, and menopause. Consequently, 
treatment recommendations may not be optimized 
for women, potentially leading to misdiagnosis and 
inadequate care.

For example, troponin tests, the gold standard of 
blood testing for the diagnosis of ACS (conditions 
characterized by sudden reduced blood supply 
to the heart), may be underdiagnosing women. 
Research has demonstrated the upper limits 
of normal may be twofold higher in men than in 
women; however, lab standards are based on men, 
resulting in underdiagnosis of women.46 One study 
showed that using sex-differentiated troponin levels

42 percent and 6 percent in men.47

When looking at common interventions for heart 
failure, women may experience greater risk, side 
effects, and even worse outcomes than men do. 
This finding could be the result of a variety of 
factors, from differences in body composition to 
drug metabolism to hormone level fluctuations.48 
One study found that standard dosing of common 
cardiac medications (for example, ACE inhibitors, 
angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers) 
resulted in increased drug effect in women than in 
men at the same dosage, with a higher frequency of 
side effects.49

Women miss out on sex-appropriate  
cardiac care because of care  
delivery gaps
A lack of knowledge, limited availability of sex- and 
gender-specific medical education, and various 
implicit and explicit biases contribute to the inequity 
in CVD care delivery.

The lack of knowledge persists throughout medical 
training. One study showed that only 22 percent of 
PCPs and 42 percent of cardiologists felt extremely 
well prepared to assess CVD risk in women.50 
Indeed, in one survey of over 40 medical schools 
in Canada and the United States, 70 percent 
of respondents didn’t formally include sex- or 
gender-specific content in their curriculum.51 With 
many women relying on an ob-gyn as their PCP, 

sex- and gender-specific cardiovascular training 
should expand beyond traditional primary care and 
cardiology training.52

Current risk formulas often overlook factors that 
influence women’s CVD risk—especially those 
related to menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and 
menopause (Exhibit 5). Additionally, research 
suggests that including health-related social 
needs (such as economic stability, neighborhood 
safety, and access to quality healthcare) in risk 
assessments for women, particularly women of 
color, can provide a more comprehensive picture of 
CVD risk.53

Previous research has examined gender disparity 
in cardiac treatment, particularly in relation to 
ACS. ACS presentation in men and women often 
differs. While chest pain is still the most common 
presentation in both sexes, women often report 
additional symptoms, such as abdominal pain,  
jaw pain, nausea, shortness of breath, palpitations, 
and vomiting.54 In one study, upon presentation 
to the hospital with chest pain, women were 
more likely than men to attribute their symptoms 
to stress or anxiety (20.9 percent versus 11.8 
percent). This may result in diagnostic inaccuracies 
and delayed treatment.

Furthermore, nonspecific electrocardiogram  
(EKG) changes are more common in women  
than in men—for example, estrogen-associated 
EKG changes mimicking ischemia.55 This may  
be exacerbated by incorrect placement of the  
EKG electrodes because of presumed signal

reduction by breast tissue.56 It can potentially be 
mitigated by ensuring correct positioning using 
bone landmarks. This can help minimize inaccuracies 
in the EKG and prevent misdiagnosis.57

Women continue to have worse outcomes after 
ACS compared with men.58 They’re less likely to 
undergo coronary revascularization and receive 
essential ACS treatment at admission or discharge, 
even when adjusted for demographics, patient 
characteristics, and type of hospital. Women were 
2.5 times less likely than men to be referred to a 
cardiologist after initial presentation with chest 
pain in an ambulatory care setting, particularly 
when the initial diagnosis was undertaken by a male 
physician.59 In addition, women treated by female 
physicians may have a better chance of surviving a 
heart attack.60

Similarly, a study has shown that women were less 
likely than men to receive more aggressive (and 
appropriate) risk-factor-modification treatment 
(for example, statins), particularly when they 
were treated by a male PCP.61 A large Canadian 
study focusing on atrial fibrillation found that 
male physicians were more likely to overestimate 
the risk of stroke in men but underestimate 
it in women.62 In contrast, female physicians 
could accurately estimate the risk in women but 
underestimate it in men.

It’s worth noting that even though half of medical-
school graduates are women, women currently 
make up only 15 percent of adult cardiologists 
and 4 percent of interventional cardiologists 
in the United States.63 Research conducted by 
the American College of Cardiology reported

The state of US women’s heart health: A path to improved health and financial outcomesthat almost two-thirds of female cardiologists 
consistently experienced discrimination at work, 
mostly related to gender and childbirth.64 Less 
than a quarter of men reported discrimination, 
which was largely in relation to race and religion 
rather than gender.

A survey of internal medicine trainees found that 
having a positive role model was the most important 
professional development need for both men 
and women.65 A significant majority of women 
felt that the field of cardiology lacked the positive 
role models they were looking for. This lack of 
role models, combined with discrimination, may 
discourage potential candidates from entering the 
field and perpetuate low rates of women serving as 
mentors for future trainees.

These biases extend beyond the clinical setting. 
Women are less likely than men to receive 
bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in case 
of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, resulting in lower 
survival to discharge (the odds ratio for men to 
women is 1.27).66

The use of AI in healthcare has seen a dramatic 
increase in recent years. Some uses show great 
promise. In one study, clinical-decision-making 
accuracy in chest pain evaluation was improved 
with the assistance of AI, without introducing or 
exacerbating existing gender biases.67 Amid busy 
schedules, clinicians often don’t have the time 
to stay on top of the latest research and clinical 
guidelines, so using AI tools as prompts to ask 
pertinent questions in a consultation (for example, 
assessing a woman’s menopausal history as part of 
a comprehensive CVD risk assessment) could be a 
viable solution.

However, machine learning models that are trained 
on data sets containing primarily men can result in 
suboptimal results, mistakes, and discriminatory 
outcomes, because they do not consider the sex 
and gender differences in health and disease.68

Innovation and investment in women’s 
heart health could make a difference

All ecosystem stakeholders could play a role in 
integrating a sex-specific lens at the onset of trial 
design, incorporating it into innovation design, 
testing, and launch. To continue discovering the 
most effective CVD prevention methods and 
interventions for women, greater investment in 
both women’s heart health and heart health overall 
is needed. CVD research funding made up less 
than 6 percent of the US National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) budget in 2022, with only a fifth of that 
dedicated to women’s heart health.69 That category 
includes, for example, conditions that may be unique 
to women or more prevalent in women than in men 
for which medical interventions may be different or 
there has been insufficient clinical data on women.

Women primarily drive 80 percent of healthcare 
decisions and spending for their families.70 However, 
investments continue deprioritizing sex-specific 
care. As biopharma companies are exploring new 
mechanisms of action for novel cardiovascular 
therapies, they can be leaders in developing sex-
specific strategies, from R&D to commercialization. 
For example, they can aim to understand the 
biological impacts on women of drug metabolism, 
pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics. 
Biopharma companies can also embrace a strategy 
for women’s heart health that extends beyond 
the cardiovascular system. This would require

The state of US women’s heart health: A path to improved health and financial outcomesacknowledging the overlap between therapeutic 
areas and cross-therapeutic area expansion (for 
example, into cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, and 
other areas).

In addition to expanding sex-segregated R&D 
across emerging clinical interventions that benefit 
both women and men, increased investment is 
needed for female-specific heart health conditions 
(for example, preeclampsia). In 2020, only 1 percent 
of healthcare research and innovation was invested 
in female-specific conditions beyond oncology.71

Venture capital investment in women’s health has 
increased 314 percent over the past five years; 
however, investment in FemTech (diagnostic tools, 
products, services, wearables, and software that 
use technology to address women’s health issues) 
makes up 2 percent of the overall health sector.72 
Women make up 13 percent of start-up founders 
overall yet were 24 percent of FemTech founders in 
2022—a rate that declined to 22 percent in 2023.73 
Since women only receive 2 percent of total venture 
capital funding in the United States,74 this puts 
FemTech at a potentially greater disadvantage.

In parallel, research suggests that cardiovascular-
health-related start-ups and innovations receive 
less funding than other major therapeutic areas 
do.75 And when they do receive funding, it’s  
mostly in digital health or data-driven business 
models, suggesting that start-ups with a 
cardiovascular focus outside of these fields may 
continue to be underfunded.76

Female leadership across healthcare research and 
delivery matters. While women make up the vast 
majority of the US healthcare workforce, only about 
a third of US hospitals are led by women, and less 
than 15 percent of system CEO roles are filled by 
women.77 A study across 4,271 medical products 

demonstrated that boards with women participating 
as directors announced recalls about four weeks 
earlier than boards with all men did.78 With a lower 
number of women in decision-making positions, 
there might be a blind spot regarding the potential 
and importance of women’s health innovations, 
especially in conditions such as CVD that have been 
primarily associated with men.

As a note, the investment landscape for FemTech 
is still nascent, with most companies in that field 
focused on maternal health, menstrual health, and 
fertility. Although there’s a growing opportunity to 
address women’s health beyond female-specific 
conditions, such as in cardiovascular health, fewer 
than 20 early-stage companies focus on women’s 
cardiac health—and the majority of those focus on 
maternal cardiac health.79 While FemTech funding 
has continued to increase, there’s still a lag in 
funding for women’s cardiovascular health.

Recommended actions to close the gap
Improving women’s cardiovascular-health outcomes 
will require prioritization and a strategic investment 
of resources, leadership, and dedicated time 
across all areas of health. Despite rising awareness 
over the past decades about the importance of 
recognizing women’s heart health, an economic 
opportunity amounting to $28 billion still exists to 
prevent the 1.6 million years of life lost because of 
poor health or premature deaths in women in the 
United States.

Stakeholders in the public and private sectors, 
including employers, not-for-profit organizations, 
and researchers, have an opportunity to embrace 
the business of better health. By addressing 
the existing gap and moving closer to achieving 
a healthier population, with a specific focus on

The state of US women’s heart health: A path to improved health and financial outcomeswomen’s heart health across all age groups, 
everyone could benefit.

Advance sex-specific research from basic  
sciences to clinical trials
Research could be meaningfully improved by 
shifting from a one-size-fits-all approach to 
prioritizing sex-specific differences:

 — Developing more knowledge around women and 
heart disease relies on a deeper understanding 
of biological differences. Future research could 
provide a crucial recognition of the distinctive 
vulnerabilities that women face across their 
lives, including during pregnancy.

 — Revamping and expanding clinical research 

initiatives may include conducting clinical trials 
specifically focused on women at all stages 
of life. Validating women-centric diagnostic 
tools and investigating the impact of CVD on 
vulnerable and intersectional populations could 
also improve care delivery.

 — Additional transparency and disclosure within 
research, drugs, and devices could lead to 
national dashboards on giving evidence on 
sex-based differences. As the evidence base 
becomes more robust, it could be built into 
clinical guidelines.

Improve routine health data collection, 
diagnostics, and treatment algorithms
Effective guidelines and algorithms rely on a 
foundation of comprehensive data collection and a 
balanced representation of women across all age 
groups and health conditions. Collecting women-
specific data in a standardized, easily digestible 
format should become routine. For example, the 
NIH has branded menstrual cycle information as the 
“fifth vital sign.”80

Potential avenues to improve routine health data 
collection and diagnostics include the following:

 — Improved diagnostic criteria for women and 
separate treatment pathways for men and 
women. There also may be applicability for other 
specialties—for example, one study found that 
breast arterial calcification, picked up on routine 
mammograms, may be a useful surrogate for 
atherosclerotic cardiac disease.81

 — Interoperable wearables that deliver 

information to providers. Smartphone apps 
to track heart health, telemedicine, heart 
health consultations, and wearable devices 
all empower individuals to keep track of 
their health. Future efforts may include that 
data being shared or flagged to a provider if 
something appears concerning.

 — AI assistance. As use of AI accelerates in 

healthcare settings, institutions could consider 
setting up continuous monitoring and evaluation 
of these novel technologies. Such efforts 
are essential to ensure their effectiveness 
in improving women’s cardiovascular-health 
outcomes, access, and care experience.

In all efforts to improve data collection, patient 
privacy must be paramount. All US-based 
companies should follow regulations such as the 
Health Breach Notification Rule, Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 rules, 21st 
Century Cures Act, and Code of Federal Regulations 
on information blocking.

Equip healthcare providers across the  
care continuum
Healthcare providers across the spectrum, 
including neurologists, PCPs, and ob-gyns, to name 
a few, could view women’s cardiovascular health 
as a shared responsibility to improve outcomes. 
Imagine, for example, creating a standard 
postpartum health visit that focused on not just 
the baby or the mom’s obstetric needs but also a 
comprehensive cardiovascular “debrief” from any 
high-risk events occurring during pregnancy.

The state of US women’s heart health: A path to improved health and financial outcomesOther actions may include the following:

the fields of heart health and menopause may 
benefit women of that generation.

 — Training on how to identify and mitigate 

potential biases within the healthcare setting. 
Hospital systems can further strengthen 
this approach by creating women’s health 
programs that bring together specialties such 
as cardiology, obstetrics–gynecology, oncology, 
and primary care. These specialists could not 
only serve patients but act as educational hubs 
for other providers within the hospital setting.

 — Expansion of the role that allied healthcare 
practitioners play in the management of 
CVD. Many people, such as doulas, midwives, 
and community workers, can be involved in 
cardiovascular care in women. For example, 
tailored, patient-centric, nurse-led interventions 
focused on self-management strategies have 
been shown to encourage a sense of ownership 
over a patient’s health journey and increase the 
likelihood of sustained positive behavior.82

Raise public awareness on heart health, and 
tailor prevention strategies across a lifespan
Public-education campaigns continue to play a 
valuable role in cardiovascular health. Culturally 
sensitive, accessible materials that raise awareness 
about risk factors, prevention strategies, and 
resources can be tailored to help those at risk of 
developing CVD. There are several additional ways 
that outreach could occur:

 — Employers. Workplace wellness programs 

can equip employees with the knowledge and 
tools to prioritize their heart health, potentially 
improving overall quality of life and removing 
absenteeism. Additionally, employers have 
opportunities to improve health through 
six modifiable drivers: economic security, 
mindsets and beliefs, productive activity, sleep, 
social interaction, and stress.83 Furthermore, 
employers can examine their boards and 
C-suites to assess whether they’re meeting their 
vision of a diverse and inclusive workplace.

Invest in furthering women’s heart health
Investing in businesses and initiatives that improve 
women’s cardiovascular health could have benefits 
for patients, society, and investors. By addressing 
the unmet needs in women’s heart health, 
businesses can make a substantial impact on the 
lives of women and potentially tap into a large, 
underserved market. Here are some items  
to consider:

 — Life science investors that focus on large, 

underserved markets (such as both heart health 
and associated conditions) could benefit from 
the relative lack of other players in this area. 
Most investments in women’s health have 
historically focused on reproductive health.

 — Educational institutions. This includes teaching 
sex-based differences, including challenges 
and opportunities related to women-specific 
care delivery, in medical-school curricula and 
throughout medical residency.

 — Employers that focus on heart health through 

workplace wellness programs or other initiatives 
could benefit from reduced absenteeism 
and potentially lower the healthcare costs 
associated with chronic conditions.

 — Direct to consumer. Engaging women through 
trusted channels in the moments that matter. 
Outreach can occur during pregnancy using 
pregnancy-specific apps. Baby boomers are the 
most likely to be on certain social media sites, 
so using those sites to provide resources within 

With 60 million US women living with CVD, the time 
to act is now. Despite recent advances, a health gap 
in CVD for women still exists. It’s underpinned by 
limited understanding of the biological differences 
of women from men and their impact on CVD;

of Cardiovascular Nursing, March 2024, Volume 23, Number 2.

The state of US women’s heart health: A path to improved health and financial outcomeswomen’s underrepresentation in clinical research; 
lower effectiveness of CVD prevention, diagnosis 
in women compared with men; and poorer care 
delivery for women compared with men. Addressing 
the gap by 2040 could give an annual 1.6 million 
years of life lost because of poor health or early 
death back to women. In parallel, it could boost the 
US economy by $28 billion and the global economy 
by at least $80 billion.

Closing the woman’s health gap in CVD can’t be 
done singlehandedly overnight. It will require 
a consistent and collective effort from various 
stakeholders, including community leaders, 
governments, healthcare institutions, individuals, 
investors, medical and nursing education 
boards, and workplaces. As women are often the 
cornerstones of their families, communities, and 

workplaces, addressing their health equity could 
have far-reaching effects on all strata of society. 
This can begin by reframing women’s heart health 
as a problem for everyone to tackle, not as a 
“women’s problem.”

Women’s heart health can be improved at every 
stage of life, and the wide gap reflects tremendous 
opportunity to improve the quality of life for every 
woman in the United States. In a new era, the 
burden of CVD could be erased, and women could 
better lend their talents, energy, and leadership to 
every sector of society. By prioritizing accessible 
healthcare, education, and research related to 
women’s heart health, a future is possible where 
millions of women not only live longer, healthier 
lives, but also contribute their full potential to a 
thriving global society.

This report reflects women’s health as a market segment. For the purposes of this report, the term “woman” was applied to 
any individual assigned female at birth and includes those under the age of 18. The authors acknowledge the importance of 
healthcare to the gender-fluid, nonbinary, and transgender communities and that not all people who identify as women are 
assigned female at birth.

The authors have used the phrase “sex and gender” to reflect inclusive language and recognize the need for future research 
into health issues that’s inclusive of the gender-fluid, nonbinary, and transgender communities. They also acknowledge the 
profound health differences among women based on factors such as age, disability, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, and 
socioeconomic status. Additional work and research should reflect on how to tackle these components alongside the overall 
women’s health gap.

This report presents the results of our 
investigation of the women’s health burden related 
to cardiovascular disease (CVD), the size of the  
health gap relative to men, and the potential to 
close that gap by addressing sources of structural 
or systematic bias. Building on the report 
published in 2024 by the McKinsey Health Institute 
and the World Economic Forum,1 this appendix 
outlines the approach and key assumptions for 
the numbers calculated in this piece. For more 
information on the methodology of the broader 
investigation, please see the 2024 report’s 
technical appendix. 

Calculating the burden for CVD
This analysis is based on an assessment of CVD 
burden, measured in disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), in women in the United States. It uses 
estimation from the Global Burden of Disease study 
data set published by the Institute of Health Metrics 
and Evaluation in 2019.

Estimating the GDP impact of CVD
To estimate the health gap impact in terms of GDP, 
we looked at the top conditions contributing to 
85 percent of the cardiovascular burden in females 
in the United States in 2019. These were ischemic 
heart disease (45 percent), stroke (28 percent), 
atrial fibrillation and flutter (6 percent), and 
hypertensive heart disease (6 percent). These 
conditions were chosen as part of the 64 conditions 
from the original report based on a ranking of the 
conditions contributing the most to the female 
health burden around the world, as measured 
in DALYs. 

To size the economic gap, we estimated the 
benefits of having a larger, healthier, and more 
productive female labor force and used it to project 
the annual potential GDP contribution to 2040. 
Economic impact was estimated by translating the 
potential health improvement from eliminating the 
women’s health gap into the associated earnings 
potential (estimated as the probability of being in 
work for the affected age group multiplied by the 
expected earnings). 

The economic impact was calculated across 
four buckets: fewer early deaths, fewer health 
conditions, increased productivity, and expanded 
participation. The first three factors expand the 
number of workers, and the last produces increased 
economic contribution per worker because of 
increased productivity.

The category of fewer early deaths covers the 
economic opportunity from additional women 
participating in the workforce. The category 
of fewer health conditions takes into account 
additional time in the workforce gained from being 
healthier (for example, lower rates of short-term 
absenteeism and of longer-term sickness-related 
absences). The category of increased productivity 
calculates the number of women affected by 
conditions associated with presenteeism and their 
potential for productivity increase, as well as the 
future earning potential of girls if poor health is 
avoided during childhood and adolescence. Finally, 
the category of expanded participation considers 
the growth of the workforce supply through the 
increased participation of groups not included in the 
workforce that require additional measures beyond 
the gain in healthy life (for example, people with 
disabilities and informal caregivers).
