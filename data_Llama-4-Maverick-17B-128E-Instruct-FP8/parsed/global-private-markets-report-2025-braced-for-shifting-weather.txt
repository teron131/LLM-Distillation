McKinsey Global Private Markets Report 2025

May 2025

Welcome to McKinsey’s Global Private Markets Report 2025

Conditions for global private markets were decidedly mixed in 2024. Dealmaking remained 
tepid, for instance, while fundraising across all asset classes fell to its lowest level since 2016, even 
as the performance of public markets increased. Yet capital deployment increased by double 
digits across asset classes, as managers adapted to a world of interest rates structurally higher 
than in previous years. Investor interest and confidence in private markets remained strong.  
In McKinsey’s latest survey of the world’s leading LPs, investors say that they will allocate more 
capital, not less, to private markets over the coming year. 

Conditions are likely to remain uneven for private markets. At the time of this report’s publication, 
geopolitical instability and changes in trade policy are emerging as critical challenges for 
managers and investors. Meanwhile, innovation in technology, particularly the rapid advancement 
of generative AI, has compelled leaders in private markets to build new capabilities in their quest 
to find more value. 

What struck us most when writing this report, however, is the resilience shown by private market 
stakeholders as they navigate an industry in transition. Fundraisers are looking beyond closed-
end channels to raise capital in new vehicles, such as evergreen funds. Dealmakers and operators 
are moving from traditional financial engineering to focus on sustained operational transformation. 
And LPs are moving from being passive allocators to investing in GPs themselves (as thriving 
secondaries and GP stakes markets reveal). 

In the first part of the report, we analyze how private equity, real estate, private debt, and 
infrastructure asset classes fared in 2024. In the second part, we share our perspectives on 
three pressing issues that cut across asset classes: the exit backlog in PE, the rise of alternative 
sources of capital, and the increasingly attractive world of secondaries and GP stakes. 

The perspectives shared here are based on our long-running research on private markets, our 
proprietary data, industry-leading data from external partners, and our experience in the field, 
working hand in hand with global investors, asset owners, and capital allocators. 

We hope you enjoy reading and look forward to hearing from you.

Private equity 
emerging from  
the fog

Global uncertainties remained in 2024, but the path  
forward for private equity became clearer, with a rebound  
in dealmaking and distributions.

4

Braced for shifting weatherTo the casual observer, 2024 may have felt like yet another difficult year for private equity (PE) 
globally. Fundraising remained tough—down 24 percent year over year for traditional 
commingled vehicles, marking the third consecutive year of decline. Investment returns were 
muted, especially compared with buoyant public markets.

Our analysis reveals a more nuanced picture. After two years of murky conditions, PE started to 
emerge from the fog in 2024.

For one, the long-awaited uptick in distributions finally arrived. For the first time since 2015, 
sponsors’ distributions to LPs exceeded capital contributions (and were the third highest on 
record).1 This increase in distributions arrived at an important time for LPs. In our 2025 proprietary 
survey2 of the world’s leading LPs, 2.5 times as many LPs ranked distributions to paid-in capital 
(DPI) as a “most critical” performance metric, compared with three years ago. There was also a 
rebound in dealmaking after two years of decline, with a notable increase in the value and 
number of large PE deals (above $500 million in enterprise value). Exit activity, in terms of value, 
started to whir again as well, especially sponsor-to-sponsor exits.

This resurgence was powered by a much more benign financing environment. The cost of financing 
a buyout declined (even though it remains much higher than the ten-year average), and new-
issue loan value for PE-backed borrowers almost doubled. In a sign of sponsors’ confidence amid 
improving financing conditions (spurred by monetary easing), entry multiples increased after 
declining in 2023, as sponsors could sell more companies at a higher average price per company.

The contrast between the past three years and the prior period could not have been starker.  
The rapid run-up in global interest rates from 2022 to 2023 (an increase of more than 500 basis 
points in the United States) shook PE to the core, an industry that had acclimated to cheap 
leverage for nearly a decade. There was a raft of other macroeconomic challenges too, including 
persistent inflation and increased geopolitical uncertainty. These and other headwinds 
prompted a slump in dealmaking while creating unanticipated disruptions in portfolio companies. 
They also complicated managers’ ability to determine the true earnings of target companies, 
especially those purchased at lofty valuations in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Even investors with near-term liquidity requirements—and conviction in the long-term value of 
potential acquisitions—struggled to execute deals in a cautious lending environment.

But PE is now starting to surface from these challenges—likely more resilient and durable than 
before. In our LP survey, 30 percent of respondents said they plan to increase their PE 
allocations in the next 12 months. Beyond offering LPs diversification, the continued appeal of 
the asset class can also be explained by its long-term performance trajectory. Since the turn  
of the millennium, PE has outpaced the S&P 500—rewarding those investors who can stomach 
the relatively lower liquidity that typically characterizes PE investments.

Braced for shifting weatherGPs, too, are evolving and innovating. In 2024, total global PE assets under management (AUM) 
appeared to decline3 by 1.4 percent by the traditional measure of closed-end commingled funds. 
Yet this drop does not capture the novel ways in which GPs are unlocking alternative sources of 
capital, such as from separately managed accounts, co-investments, and partnerships. These 
alternative forms of capital have provided a multitrillion-dollar boost to global PE AUM. GPs are 
also increasingly sourcing new funds from noninstitutional investors, such as high-net-worth 
individuals. They do this through multiple channels (such as aggregators and wealth managers) 
and with multiple vehicles (such as open-end and semi-open-end funds)—all of which are more 
accessible than traditional closed-end vehicles to retail and high-net-worth investors.

To address growing liquidity demands from LPs, an increasing number of GPs are creating new 
fund structures, including setting up continuation vehicles. And they are increasingly expanding 
their use of deal structures such as public-to-private (P2P) transactions and carve-outs, to 
accelerate deployment. In Europe, where P2P activity has historically been subdued, the total 
value of P2Ps was up 65 percent in 2024.

Meanwhile, scale continues to provide a competitive advantage to managers: Over the past  
five years, the top 100 GPs made approximately three times more acquisitions of competing GPs 
than they did in the previous five years. This scale could provide GPs with more flexibility and 
help them diversify income streams; although, its correlation with performance or fundraising is 
unclear (smaller, midmarket funds proved easier to raise in 2024 than the largest funds).

Of course, the fog hasn’t entirely cleared: There were some industry pockets that continued to 
face rough weather. Venture capital (VC) recorded a bigger decline in deal count and lower 
growth in deal value than other PE subasset classes globally. Across asset classes, Asia lagged 
behind North America and Europe year over year in fundraising (driven principally by a retreat 
from China), performance, and deal activity. As the fog lifts, we can more clearly see those in 
peril—even within better-performing asset classes like buyouts. Some funds are facing twin 
pressures of elevated marks and the inability to sell their portfolio companies. Over time, the 
spread between better-differentiated and better-performing funds and less-differentiated  
and worse-performing funds may widen.

The PE industry will also need to monitor and address other challenges. It is uncertain, for now, 
whether or for how long the hangover from the exuberant dealmaking of 2021 and 2022 will last. 
The exit backlog of sponsor-owned companies is bigger in value, count, and as a share of total 
portfolio companies than at any point in the past two decades. Selling these assets, especially 
when the marks are likely to remain elevated on many sponsors’ books (given high entry 
multiples in 2021 and the increasing role of GP-led secondaries, which often bring exits below 
marks), will require more than just high hopes that the market will turn. Refinancing those 
portfolio companies in an uncertain, higher-rate, and more discerning lending environment will 
also be challenging. Meanwhile, investors and operators need to consider increasing geopolitical

initiatives. All stakeholders must also confront rapid evolutions in AI. What is top of mind for the 
investors and operators we work with is building best-in-class data science teams within fund 
operations, developing AI-enabled value creation initiatives that can drive portfolio-wide impact, 
and scaling external AI partnerships.

In this first article from our flagship Global Private Markets Report, we analyze how PE fared in 
2024—and what it might mean for the year ahead. We consider this from the perspective of  
four groups: dealmakers, fundraisers, LPs, and the operators tasked with creating value in 
privately held firms.

Global PE dealmaking rebounded significantly in 2024 after two years of decline, rising by  
14 percent to $2 trillion (Exhibit 1). The uptick in activity made 2024 the third-most-active  
year on record for the asset class by value. Deal value increased across buyout, growth equity,  
and venture capital subasset classes but declined steeply in Asia (see sidebar “Asia’s  
private equity slowdown”).

Asia’s private equity slowdown

Asia was the only region that saw a decline in 
assets under management (AUM) last year, 
dropping by 5.5 percent to $2.7 trillion (exhibit). 
This was accompanied by a continued drop  
in fundraising (32 percent lower in 2024), led 
primarily by declines in China, as well as 
lackluster performance (less than 0.2 percent IRR 
through the first three quarters of 2024). As a 
result, private equity (PE) net asset value (NAV) 
and dry powder both declined in the region, falling 
2.3 percent and 20.0 percent, respectively.

In contrast to Asia, North American and 
European PE AUM increased at 4.4 percent and 
3.0 percent, respectively, from the first half of 
2023 to the first half of 2024. The AUM growth  
in both regions was driven by NAV increases  
and subdued by dry powder declines (with deal 
volumes rising and fundraising slowing).  
North America and Europe’s PE NAV rose by  
8.8 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively,  
while dry powder declined by 6.8 percent and 
10.2 percent, respectively.

Braced for shifting weatherMeanwhile, the number of PE deals across subasset classes4 dropped for a third consecutive 
year, largely because of the continued decline in venture capital’s dealmaking velocity, which saw 
a 16.9 percent year-over-year drop in count (see sidebar “Venture capital’s continued crunch”). 
Additionally, the global deal count for buyouts decreased marginally by 1.7 percent, with year-

Venture capital’s continued crunch

In 2023, fundraising for venture capital declined 
by nearly 58 percent year over year. In 2024,  
the rate of decline was lower (fundraising for 
buyouts, venture capital, and growth equity each 
declined by 23 percent to 25 percent), but the 
strategy continues to struggle across several 
metrics. This poor performance is indicative  
of the ongoing challenges of the start-up 
environment globally, as well as continued 
declines in Asia, a region that comprises  
more than half of venture capital’s total assets 
under management (exhibit).

Consider this: Last year’s $102 billion fundraising 
total for venture capital was less than a third  
of 2022’s $314 billion. Deal activity in venture

capital has also remained far more challenged 
than for buyouts across 2023 and 2024.  
While buyout’s deal value rebounded by  
15.5 percent in 2024, it was only 6.7 percent 
higher for venture capital. There was a 
noticeable gap in deal count as well: Buyout  
deal count fell by 1.7 percent compared with 
venture capital’s 16.9 percent drop.

There was some silver lining for the strategy  
last year: A marginal improvement in venture 
capital’s performance (an IRR of 1.9 percent 
through September 30, 2024, versus a negative 
IRR of 2.5 percent in the preceding 12 months). 
Even then, buyout strategy outperformed venture 
capital, with an IRR of 4.5 percent.

Venture capital led the decline in closed-end, commingled private equity 
assets under management in 2024.

in deployment. Consider the entry EBITDA multiples in the buyout subasset class, which 
reverted to 2021–22 levels, after decreasing in 2023 (Exhibit 3). The overall increase in multiples 
is a positive sign, although some of it may also be attributed to a change in the quality mix, where 
sponsors are exiting higher-quality businesses that are achieving better valuations.

Braced for shifting weatherPE financing costs eased as lender spreads and Secured Overnight Financing Rates (SOFR) 
declined in mid-to-late 2024, driven by reduced risk premiums and stabilizing rate expectations. 
GPs also levered their deals marginally more in 2024, at roughly 4.1 times net debt to EBITDA, 
versus 4.0 times in 2023, reflecting improved debt availability and lenders’ willingness to 
underwrite larger capital structures. However, buyout leverage remains below the ten-year 
average of 4.2 times and well below the 4.7 times high in 2021, indicating that while credit 
conditions have loosened, underwriting discipline and valuation pressures still constrain 
leverage expansion.

With active deployment and fewer capital calls, GPs began to draw down on the global stock of 
dry powder—the amount of capital committed but not yet deployed. Global PE dry powder 
decreased 11 percent (to $2.1 trillion) between the first half of 2023 and the first half of 2024. 
Similarly, dry powder inventory—or the amount of capital available to GPs, expressed as a 
multiple of annual deployment—fell to 1.89 years in 2024, from 2.02 in the prior year, hovering 
around historical levels (Exhibit 4).

Braced for shifting weatherOur analysis points to five global trends in dealmaking.

Bigger is back
Nowhere was the overall rebound more evident than in large buyout transactions in North 
America and Europe. Deals above $500 million in enterprise value rose in both value (37 percent) 
and count (3 percent), reflecting the increase in average deal size (Exhibit 5). This segment is 
considered a true proxy for industry health, as many of the largest sponsors are often reluctant 
to invest below this threshold, given the need to deploy at scale. In our work with investors,  
there is a growing willingness among sponsors to write bigger tickets, led by stronger conviction 
in their ability to realize higher returns and renewed confidence in the industry’s growth outlook.

Long-term trends in sector allocation persist
PE investors’ buying preferences continue to evolve. Sectors like technology outperformed 
(2024 was the third highest on record in terms of deal value), while healthcare continued its post-
COVID-19 retreat (Exhibit 6). These trends hold across deal sizes: As often happens, larger 
sponsors’ buying preferences can be mirrored in the investment choices of smaller sponsors  
that are looking to sell to them.

Braced for shifting weatherPublic companies are becoming more attractive
P2P transactions, especially in Europe, picked up in 2024. Many sponsors likely see merit in 
taking undervalued companies private rather than picking over the portfolios of their peers, 
despite the challenges involved in executing such transactions, including greater deal complexity, 
the need for large take-private premiums in bids, and greater public relations scrutiny.

Although such transactions currently remain a small part of global PE deal value and volume, they 
are gaining a growing share. In 2024, P2P deals accounted for 11 percent of total global PE  
deal value, compared with 9 percent in 2023. Europe recorded a 65 percent year-over-year 
increase in the value of such deals, with increasing participation among US sponsors (who 
were represented in nearly 75 percent of P2P deals by value in the past five years, compared with 
just 50 percent in the prior decade). The year 2024 also became the second highest on record  
in terms of the number of P2P transactions globally.

Exits are warming up but not sizzling
Buying companies is just the start of a dealmaker’s job. Selling them at the right price is what 
delivers returns for GPs and LPs. On this front, 2024 saw some improvements. PE-backed exit 
value increased by 7.6 percent to $813 billion in 2024 after two years of decline (reaching the 
third highest on record), and the average holding period for buyout deals decreased for the first 
time since 2020. As with purchasing companies, PE-backed exits larger than $500 million 
increased in both count (10 percent) and value (16 percent).

PE portfolios are getting older
Despite improvement in the pace of exits, the backlog of assets that are in their divestment period 
is growing globally. Average buyout hold times remain above the long-term average (6.7 years 
versus the average of 5.7 years over the past 20 years). In fact, the exit backlog is bigger now 
than at any point since 2005. There are more PE-backed companies (comprising a greater  
share of total GP portfolios) awaiting exit than ever before. In fact, companies in PE ownership 
(excluding add-ons) for more than four years comprised 61 percent of all buyout-backed  
assets, up from 55 percent in 2023 and the ten-year average of 53 percent. Although this 
reflects the growing influence of private investors in the overall economy5 (there are more 
PE-owned companies), crystalizing their value remains tricky.

As exit periods are extended, there are three key considerations for investors. First, they could 
think about value creation over longer time horizons. Our recent LP survey6 shows that LPs are 
receptive to longer holding periods if there is consistent value creation during that time. While  
IRR is still the top-ranked performance metric, with 35 percent of LPs ranking IRR as critical,  
21 percent of LPs now rank multiple of invested capital (MOIC) as critical (up from 15 percent 
three years ago). Given MOIC is not weighed down by longer holding periods (unlike IRR), its 
growing importance indicates LP receptiveness to longer hold periods (assuming the distributions 
still flow). Second, investors could consider exit routes even more thoughtfully. Extended holding 
periods due to a lack of suitable exit options can still jeopardize returns. As deals increase in size 
(often beyond the limits of even the largest sponsors), the number of potential exit routes

investors can prepare the ground to ensure sufficient liquidity and reckon with potentially trickier 
refinancing conditions, especially as the 2021–22 vintage acquisitions manage their borrowing.

IPOs remain tough
The relative increase in sponsor-to-sponsor exits (up 16 percent by value and 10 percent by share  
of deal count) could suggest some long-awaited narrowing of bid–ask spreads, as sellers become 
more realistic about expected valuations (Exhibit 7). But even as equity markets have rebounded, 
IPOs remain a challenging exit option. PE-backed IPOs (including reverse mergers) fell 7 percent, 
to $154 billion, in value and 20 percent in count. Anecdotally, the share of equity floated in  
an IPO also continues to decline, which makes realizing liquidity and distributions through this 
exit process tougher.

IPOs are especially critical for larger sponsors. IPOs comprised just 5 percent of the total 
PE-backed exit count in 2024, but nearly 22 percent of PE-backed exits greater than $500 million. 
As fund sizes have grown, many GPs are buying bigger companies that face more constrained  
exit options. The bigger the company, the fewer sponsors or corporates that can purchase it, 
especially if the valuation rises prior to exit. If IPOs continue to decline as a share of exits, 
sponsors may need to shift their focus more to finding long-term corporate acquirers for their 
assets (especially the larger ones).

For the typical PE GP, fundraising did not get any easier in 2024. Fundraising declined for the 
third consecutive year, decreasing by 24 percent year over year to $589 billion.

Fundraising declined in North America, Europe, and Asia, although the decline was comparatively 
smaller in Europe (falling by 11 percent) (Exhibit 8). Fundraising for buyout, growth equity,  
and venture capital declined between 23 to 25 percent each, in contrast to 2023, when buyout 
outperformed—although the 42 percent fundraising growth during the year could have been 
distorted by a few megafund closes (Exhibit 9).

GPs are also taking longer to wrap up fundraising: Funds that closed in 2024 were open for  
a record-high 21.9 months, compared with 19.6 months in 2023 and 14.1 months in 2018.  
The total number of PE funds closed also fell to the lowest level in a decade. Meanwhile, roughly 
420 buyout funds closed in 2024, which is lower than the ten-year average of around 460.

The following two trends stand out in our assessment of how PE fundraising fared in 2024.

Braced for shifting weatherMidmarket fundraising appears more resilient
In an overall down year, midmarket funds (ranging from $1 billion to $5 billion in size) were  
the only category that bucked the trend (fundraising was approximately flat year over year). This 
was the first time in three years that the largest PE fundraisers did not record fundraising  
growth, although this could be a function of fewer mega fund closures of more than $10 billion 
(Exhibit 10).

Midmarket funds are also increasingly gaining share from smaller players (Exhibit 11). Funds  
smaller than $1 billion in size were in market for five months longer than in prior years, while first-
time funds only managed to raise $34 billion in 2024, the lowest total since 2013.

Braced for shifting weatherTraditional fundraising is getting harder, even as LPs are increasing allocations
Based on proprietary benchmarking of LP target allocations from CEM Benchmarking,  
we see that LPs have consistently increased their target allocation to PE even amid 
uncertainty—rising from 6.3 percent at the beginning of 2020 to 8.3 percent at the start of  
2024 (Exhibit 12).

Our survey of leading LPs indicates that, despite being overallocated by approximately 175 basis 
points at the beginning of 2024, a greater proportion of LPs plan to increase their allocations  
to PE (30 percent), compared with those that want to reduce them (16 percent) (Exhibit 13). This 
signals investors’ fundamental conviction in the ability of the asset class to generate superior 
returns over the long run, despite any near-term challenges

How do we explain why fundraising might be getting harder even as LPs are increasing 
allocations? For one, although distributions are up, they remain lumpy—many LPs prefer to  
wait for some distributions before recommitting or subscribing to a new fund. This is  
especially true in the context of the significant exit backlog we see today. Second, more  
vehicles are competing for LPs’ funds. Third, most GPs look for multiyear commitments,  
which can complicate annual fundraising.

LPs: Distribution growth offsetting muted returns
For LPs, cash started to become king again in 2024. Distributions exceeded capital calls for the 
first half of the year, putting 2024 on track to be the first full year since 2015 where PE LPs saw 
net positive cash flows. This suggests that persistent demands from investors for liquidity were 
proactively addressed by GPs (Exhibit 14).

However, PE returns across subasset classes continued to decline, with the industry-wide IRR 
for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 decreasing to roughly 3.8 percent from  
5.7 percent in the prior year, well below the historical average of roughly 14.5 percent since 2010 
(Exhibit 15). Among subasset classes, buyouts were the strongest performer through the first 
three quarters of 2024 (4.5 percent IRR), in line with historical trends, followed by growth equity 
(4.2 percent IRR) and venture capital (1.9 percent IRR).

2024 marked the third time in the past four years that public markets outperformed overall 
private equity, a stark contrast to the previous decade, during which the latter consistently 
outperformed public equities. In fact, even after excluding the so-called Magnificent Seven,7 the 
benchmark S&P 500 returned over 17 percent through the first and third quarters of 2024, 
outperforming all private equity subasset classes. When analyzed over a longer period of ten or 
25 years, however, the buyout subasset class has historically outperformed public equities, 
which likely explains LPs’ continued support for the asset class (in addition to it providing LPs 
with diversification opportunities) (Exhibit 16).

Moreover, buyout multiples have continued to remain lower than public multiples, partly 
reflecting the so-called illiquidity penalty of investing in longer-life, more illiquid private markets 
(Exhibit 17). In 2024, the delta between public and buyout multiples grew further, with buyout 
purchases remaining cheaper than public stock purchases (as they have for more than 15 years).

7  Magnificent Seven refers to a select set of the seven highest-performing companies in the US stock market—in 2024, these 

were Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.

Braced for shifting weatherOur analysis of 2024 activity points toward a maturing industry structure and the rise of an 
ecosystem that delivers solutions around it. There are two trends that we believe are particularly 
pertinent to LPs.

LPs have become part of the liquidity solution
With liquidity remaining a pressing issue for LPs, and exits still backlogged, the secondary 
market has increasingly become a critical source of liquidity for LPs. Secondaries’ transaction 
value rose 45 percent to an all-time high of $162 billion last year, according to Jefferies’  
market review.8 More than half of this total comprised LP-led deals (reflecting how LPs found  
a way to monetize their investments). The pricing LPs could expect when trading their fund 
stakes rose from 85 percent of NAV in 2023 to 89 percent in 2024. LPs have also embraced 
GP-led secondaries, rising to an all-time high of $75 billion, 84 percent of which came from 
continuation vehicle transactions.

Asset class conviction and asset manager conviction are now in sync
If the liquidity needs of LPs have propelled the secondaries market to greater heights, their 
growing interest in directly investing in GPs is indicative of their fundamental belief in the long-
term value of GPs as well as the private equity industry. According to our LP survey, roughly  
43 percent of LPs invest in GP stakes funds today. Of those, around 56 percent (led by sovereign 
wealth funds) are considering buying direct GP stakes.

For PE operators, there has never  
been a greater need to focus on  
value creation to drive returns, given 
increasing purchase prices and 
lengthening holding periods.

Braced for shifting weatherOperators: The value creation imperative endures
For PE operators, there has never been a greater need to focus on value creation to drive  
returns, given increasing purchase prices (as a multiple of EBITDA) and lengthening holding 
periods. While multiple expansion has driven private equity returns for a decade, steeper  
entry multiples and the heightened cost of leverage mean this lever is unlikely to persist for  
the next decade.

Analysis by StepStone Group indicates that, for deals done 2010–22, leverage and multiple 
expansion comprised 61 percent of returns. The remaining 39 percent came from revenue 
growth and EBITDA margin expansion (Exhibit 18). Over the past decade, however, the expansion 
in leverage and multiples has forced managers to focus on operational improvements to  
maintain their target returns. As a result, operators’ ability to increase top-line revenue and 
improve margins is increasingly under scrutiny from GPs and LPs.

Braced for shifting weatherWe see four trends shaping how operators are creating value within their portfolios.

Companies are not doing it alone
Investors are increasingly involving themselves, through portfolio operations teams, in value 
creation. In our proprietary survey of private equity operating groups conducted in 2024,9  
we found that the average operating group size across funds of all sizes has more than doubled  
in the past three years alone. GPs are realizing that achieving returns will require dedicated 
specialist help, regardless of their AUM size.

M&A remains a key enabler of returns
Even as some of the more traditional M&A roll-up plays for sponsors have slowed, add-on  
M&A (for example, acquisitions undertaken by a PE-backed company) only appears to  
be accelerating. Add-on acquisitions (especially when the synergy case is clear) are gaining 
popularity: Roughly 40 percent of total PE deal value in 2024 was from add-ons rather  
than platform deals—the second-highest ratio in a decade after 2023 (Exhibit 19).

Braced for shifting weatherOrganic cash generation is key to managing leverage
Given higher financing costs, companies have less headroom for mistakes than before. As 
McKinsey’s research notes, rising interest rates and profitability challenges can be a toxic mix for 
companies, leading to triggered covenants and (in some cases) loss of sponsor control. Even  
as trading conditions improve, the discipline of improved cash management in the near term (and 
accelerating cash generation) are vital to achieving long-term returns.

Portfolio companies are taking the lead on exits
We are seeing portfolio companies investing more in exit preparation, given the need to achieve 
attractive returns in an environment with increased buyside scrutiny on valuations and elevated 
interest rates. Most commonly, this preparation includes investing in growth and operational 
improvement initiatives ahead of the sale process to demonstrate progress against select value 
creation theses for potential next owners. Additionally, market studies are becoming increasingly 
common to boost buyers’ conviction on growth and value creation potential, and to tackle  
nuanced questions (such as AI-related risks and energy-transition-related opportunities  
and risks).

Low visibility conditions in fog can make navigation difficult. Planes can’t take off. Ships linger  
in the port longer. Cars drive slower. As the fog dissipates, what lies ahead gets clearer  
(and brighter) and things move freely again. In the private equity industry, throughout the rough 
weather conditions of recent years, dealmakers, fundraisers, LPs, and operators strived to 
regain and maintain momentum. As the weather clears up, it reveals an industry more resilient, 
innovative, and stronger than before.

for daylight 

Real estate inched closer to a full recovery in 2024.

31

Braced for shifting weatherThe real estate industry charted an uneven path to recovery in 2024. Some strategies and 
sectors found stability, while others continued to face substantial headwinds. 

On the plus side, global real estate deal value grew in 2024 for the first time in three years, rising 
11 percent to $707 billion, from $634 billion in 2023. The partial rebound was driven by rate cuts 
that created a less unfavorable financing environment, compression in capitalization (cap) rates, 
and reduced supply in sectors such as multifamily and industrial. Additionally, asset values  
may now be stabilizing as investors improve their risk assessment of the asset class.

However, fundraising woes continued throughout the year. Global closed-end fundraising declined 
by 28 percent to $104 billion, the lowest annual total since 2012. The decline in fundraising 
varied across Asia–Pacific, Europe, and the United States. Debt fundraising declined the most, 
by 44 percent year over year—though much of the capital raised for debt strategy is being 
channeled through broader special-situation and opportunistic vehicles instead of dedicated 
debt funds. According to our analysis, opportunistic fundraising declined by 31.5 percent  
to $37 billion, though the data may be skewed by fund timing—fundraising in 2023 included the 
largest fund ever raised, an opportunistic vehicle four times the size of 2024’s largest fund.  
And while net flows from open-end core funds continued to be negative, they grew marginally  
to –$12.0 billion in 2024, up from –$12.6 billion in 2023, as investors rotated into higher- 
return strategies. 

LPs maneuvered through mixed real estate performance. Returns for closed-end real estate 
funds remained negative, with a pooled IRR of –1.1 percent through the third quarter of 2024. 
Open-end funds were also under pressure: NFI-OE1 funds recorded a gross return of –1.6 percent 
in 2024, registering their second annual decline since the 2008 global financial crisis. 

In other areas, performance improved. The NCREIF Property Index, which measures property-
level returns, saw positive property-level unlevered total returns in 2024, driven by a rebound  
in appreciation and stronger income returns. Alternative sectors also posted robust returns, with 
manufactured housing and senior housing generating total returns of 11.7 percent and  
5.6 percent, respectively, in 2024. Meanwhile, data centers, which have become real estate’s 
most sought-after sector, delivered 11.2 percent returns. GPs that have the operational 
expertise/partnerships to manage access to power, tenant relationships with hyperscalers,  
and zoning constraints were able to raise capital for data centers at scale.

As GPs look for ways to increase net operating income in the current environment, those investors 
with operational capabilities and expertise are taking market share from capital allocators. GPs 
with operational capabilities accounted for 37 percent of real estate assets under management 
in 2023, up about 11 percentage points over the past decade. For their part, some leading  
capital allocators are starting to harness the power of analytics and actively managing their 
operator partners to enhance their service delivery and ensure consistent alpha generation. 

Here’s a deep dive into these trends and implications for dealmakers, fundraisers, and LPs.

In 2024, global real estate deal value grew for the first time since 2021, reversing a multiyear 
decline2 (Exhibit 1). The strongest rebound occurred in sectors underpinned by durable secular 
fundamentals such as multifamily and industrial, where deal value increased by 20 percent  
and 16 percent, respectively. 

Real estate dealmakers in Asia–Pacific recorded the highest year-over-year growth in 
transaction value: 14 percent. Meanwhile, deal value grew by 11 percent and 10 percent in the 
Americas and in the EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) region, respectively.

Braced for shifting weatherWithin regions, deal value varied significantly by sector. In Asia–Pacific, for instance, industrial real 
estate’s deal value grew by 60 percent, fueled by supply chain reconfiguration and nearshoring 
strategies amid geopolitical shifts. In the EMEA hotel sector, deal value increased by 58 percent, 
driven by a perceived undersupply caused by rising travel demand following the COVID-19 
pandemic. And in the Americas, multifamily deal value grew by 27 percent, supported by sustained 
long-term demand for rental housing amid persistent housing affordability challenges.

The partial recovery in global deal value was driven by a few factors. Interest rate cuts created a 
less unfavorable financing environment, prompting an increase in the issuance of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities and reducing borrowing costs. As a result, some deals that weren’t 
projected to meet return thresholds at this time last year suddenly became viable. Supply also fell 
throughout 2024: Construction starts in the United States’ industrial sector, for instance, 
declined by 32 percent year over year, while new multifamily construction dropped by 41 percent. 
Cap rates also compressed across multiple sectors, signaling a more competitive pricing 
environment. For example, cap rates declined by approximately 40 basis points in the multifamily 
sector (to 5.2 percent) and by 25 basis points in the retail sector (to 7.0 percent).3 This 
compression suggests that asset values may now be stabilizing, as the market starts to  
factor in lower perceived risk of investing in commercial real estate. 

Nevertheless, a few challenges are impeding real estate’s full recovery. First, the net asset value 
(NAV) of open-end funds in the United States continues to decline. It decreased by 14 percent in 
2024, more than double last year’s 6 percent decline, but is still hovering around 2021 levels.4 Our 
research shows that NAV began to stabilize in the fourth quarter of 2024, though it remains to  
be seen whether this marks a true inflection point or a temporary bump amid ongoing valuation 
challenges. When analyzing cap rate and NAV data, it’s important to remember that cap rate 
compression reflects real-time market demand based on transaction data. Changes in NAV can 
lag, as they rely on periodic appraisals that aren’t in real time.

The partial recovery in global deal value 
was driven by a few factors, including  
an increase in the issuance of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities and 
reduction in borrowing costs.

Braced for shifting weatherAnother challenge has been a moderation in the rate of rent growth across many traditional 
sectors—even across decade-long investor favorites—after reaching record highs. For example, 
the growth in rent for multifamily properties has been less strong since the first quarter of 2022, 
from 9.7 percent to just 1.1 percent by the close of the fourth quarter of 2024. Industrial-rent 
growth has also slowed considerably over the past 12 months, settling at 2.1 percent, which is 
less than half of the average growth rate recorded during the five years leading up to the  
COVID-19 pandemic. Only a few sectors continue to see strong gains. Data centers in the United 
States are one example where rents grew by 12.7 percent in 2024, fueled by strong tenant 
demand and constrained supply.5

Our analysis points to three global trends in dealmaking. 

Surging demand for data centers
In 2024, data centers emerged as one of the strongest-performing commercial real estate 
sectors. Investor interest in the sector was driven by sustained tenant demand, constrained supply 
of power-ready sites, long-term leases with hyperscaler tenants, and attractive development 
economics (see sidebar, “The race to build data centers”). Data center occupancy levels have 
reached record highs of more than 95 percent in major markets, by most estimates. By contrast, 
most other sectors are hovering around their historical averages, except for office spaces,  
where occupancy declined to 86 percent (below the ten-year average of 90 percent).6 Moreover, 
the stabilized yield-on-cost for data center development exceeds 10 percent, while value 
creation margins are about 50 percent.7

In terms of the tenant mix, hyperscalers drove more than 4,000 megawatts of new leasing in 
2024—the highest annual volume in history—by securing large preleases with data center 
operators across major global markets.8 These forward commitments accounted for most of  
the data center demand and triggered an increase in new development, as most data center  
supply is built to suit rather than speculative. With an estimated 75 percent of the data center 
construction pipeline already preleased, hyperscalers remain a key force behind capacity 
expansion to meet accelerating digital-infrastructure needs.9

Value creation through operational capabilities
Investors with operational capabilities and expertise, and capital allocators, have historically 
represented two distinct GP approaches to investing in commercial real estate, but the former 
has gained more prominence in recent times. 

Investors with operational capabilities create value by directing property-level operations. They 
combine hands-on asset management, property operations, and development capabilities to 
improve value at the property level. By contrast, capital allocators focus on portfolio management 
and operating-partner selection. They harness investment acumen and capital structuring 
initiatives to create value in the asset without guiding detailed value creation plans at the property 
level. Both models consist of generalist GPs that invest across sectors, as well as specialist 
managers that concentrate on select sectors.

5  Reflects Green Street’s M-RevPAF (market revenue per available foot) metric, which combines changes in occupancy and asking 

rents into a single measure. The metric is reflective of a portfolio marked-to-market annually (excluding power costs). The percent 
changes can be used interchangeably with the data center sector’s conventional rent calculated per kilowatt of power capacity.

The race to build data centers 

Digital and cloud revolutions have exponentially 
increased the demand for data centers. According 
to McKinsey’s proprietary data center demand 
model projections, total data-center-critical IT 
demand was 60 gigawatts in 2024. By the end of 
the decade, the annual demand could nearly 
triple and reach around 171 to 219 gigawatts.1 

McKinsey’s analysis suggests that data center 
demand that’s unconstrained by supply could be 
well north of 250 gigawatts—a challenging feat 
given power constraints globally and in the United 
States, as well as other supply chain issues.2

To capitalize on this demand for data centers, GPs 
will need to secure sites with reliable and cost- 
effective access to power while addressing 

challenges such as power shortages, grid 
limitations, and transmission constraints that 
can restrict new development. They will need  
to manage these factors alongside traditional 
issues such as zoning restrictions and land 
availability. Equally critical is the ability to attract 
and retain a small number of hyperscaler tenants 
that now wield significant buying power  
in the market. GPs can achieve competitive 
differentiation by building deep, trusted 
relationships with these tenants, as they are 
increasingly dictating lease terms and preleasing 
decisions in major markets. GPs that have  
done these things and built operationally intensive 
platforms have succeeded in raising significant 
capital and doubling down on their data  
center investments.

2 “What the real estate industry needs to know about data centers,” McKinsey, October 15, 2024.

At a time when GPs can no longer rely on just cap rate compression to create returns, they’re 
increasingly prioritizing strategies to grow net operating income. As a result, investors with 
operational capabilities are gaining market share. Consider these data points: Although generalist 
allocators still make up the majority of real estate’s assets under management (54 percent),  
the share of investors with operational capabilities has grown by around 11 percentage points over 
the past ten years.10

Particularly in the current environment, investors with operational capabilities can create  
value through improved end-user experiences, access to and use of data, and efficient delivery 
models. This is all underpinned by investors having greater control over operations, which 
enables more robust risk management, and ultimately leads to stronger property performance, 
including higher retention of clients, ancillary-services revenue, better ROI on customer/client 
acquisition, and lower-cost property operations. Digital and data are core to driving these 
tangible outcomes in the portfolio. Such operational expertise can be built in-house or accessed 
through strategic partnerships.

capabilities (such as property management) to create value through operations. That’s no longer 
the case. Sophisticated capital allocators can now use data and technology to embed their 
expertise more efficiently in the day-to-day management of a property—for example, using data 
and tooling to track maintenance needs across properties; deploying intelligent ticketing and 
routing systems to improve response times; building tools that infuse “hospitality” into the tenant 
journey at every step; and using AI to drive capital expenditure, acquisition, and disposition 
decisions. As operational expertise becomes more central to value creation, tech enablement 
will become an even greater source of competitive advantage for both types of players, driving 
strategic distance.

The looming wall of maturities
Nearly $2.1 trillion of $4.8 trillion in commercial real estate loans in the United States are set  
to mature within the next three years, particularly in the office and multifamily sectors.11  
Many owners who delayed refinancing their loans now face valuation gaps, tighter lending  
conditions, as well as the risk of write-downs, distressed sales, or surrendering their  
properties. This environment also presents opportunities for debt fund managers to meet 
owners’ capital needs, acquire distressed assets at discounts, and offer creative financing 
solutions. For strategics, this disruption could also be a chance to reposition their portfolios 
and capitalize on market dislocations.

Investors with operational capabilities 
can create value through improved  
end-user experiences, access to and  
use of data, and efficient delivery 
models, all underpinned by strong  
risk management.

Global closed-end fundraising declined by 28 percent to $104 billion, the lowest annual total 
since 2012 (Exhibit 2). Closed-end fundraising in the United States declined by 22 percent year 
over year, while fundraising in Europe and Asia both declined approximately 50 percent. 

Opportunistic fundraising declined by 31.5 percent to $37 billion, although the decrease was 
partially driven by the timing of funds coming to market, which is likely to have skewed the overall 
total and disproportionately distorted this segment. For instance, an opportunistic vehicle that 
closed in 2023 and became the largest-ever fund to have been raised was more than four times 
the size of 2024’s largest vehicle.

Braced for shifting weatherIn fact, our conversations with leaders suggest that even though fundraising remains fragile, 
investors are increasingly willing to underwrite complexity and dislocation, with the goal of 
capturing outsize returns in a recovering market.

Real estate debt fundraising declined by 44 percent, even amid growing investor interest in the 
strategy. Meanwhile, closed-end core and core plus continued their descent to decade lows, 
declining by an aggregate of 27 percent year over year.

Two trends stand out in our assessment of how real estate fundraising fared in 2024: rising 
interest in real estate debt and continued pressures faced by open-end funds.

Rising interest in real estate debt
The decline in fundraising for dedicated real estate debt vehicles in 2024 masks the broader  
rise of real assets credit strategies—many of which are being deployed at scale through special- 
situation, opportunistic, or multiasset platforms.

In our 2025 McKinsey LP Survey, 63 percent of the respondents expressed an interest in 
investing in real estate debt in 2025, up from 56 percent in the prior year. The appeal of real 
estate debt is multifold. Credit strategies have historically offered more stable returns and  
lower risk compared with equity investments, which may be appealing to investors in a volatile 
market. In addition, the recent surge in loan maturities and the tightening of traditional bank 
lending have amplified demand for alternative financing structures such as mezzanine debt and 
preferred equity. This positions real estate credit as a vital solution for refinancing gaps and 
distressed-asset repositioning.

Although several large real estate debt funds have closed in recent months, overall fund 
formation in the segment hasn’t yet occurred. This is potentially because many credit-oriented 
deals are being executed through broader special-situation or opportunistic vehicles rather than 
within real-estate-only strategies.

There’s also structural complexity in how LPs approach the asset class. Responsibility for real 
estate credit allocations varies across LP organizations, sometimes sitting within a credit team 
and other times within the real estate team, which can create ambiguity for GPs seeking to 
engage appropriate capital allocators. While investors’ interest in the space continues to grow, a 
lack of standardized ownership of real estate credit within LP organizations may slow capital 
formation. At the same time, these challenges provide an opportunity for platforms (for example, 
a dedicated investment and operating group within an organization, often with in-house 
management and specialized expertise in a specific sector, strategy, or geography) to offer 
tailored real estate credit solutions to these investors.

In addition to organizational factors, several market dynamics may help explain the slower pace 
of dedicated fund formation. Some institutional investors (for example, life insurers and pension 
funds) may be allocating to real estate debt through direct investments rather than pooled 
vehicles. At the same time, spreads between mortgage rates and corporate credit yields have 
compressed, potentially reducing the relative attractiveness of the substrategy for some 
investors. With overall transaction activity still modest, despite growth from last year, the volume 
of equity deals requiring debt financing remains limited, dampening near-term demand for  
large-scale deployment.

39

Braced for shifting weatherOpen-end funds continue to face pressures 
In the United States, open-end core funds, as tracked by the NFI-OE Index, represent an 
important segment of institutional real estate exposure. These vehicles typically offer more 
stable income, quarterly liquidity, and lower leverage to investors, compared with closed-end  
funds and other vehicles. In 2024, net investor cash flows (calculated as distributions minus 
contributions and redemptions) improved only marginally and remained significantly negative, 
totaling –$12.0 billion compared with the all-time low of –$12.6 billion in 2023 (Exhibit 3).

While redemptions and distributions in the NFI-OE rose modestly, the slightly larger increase in 
contributions drove the marginal improvement in net flows. This improvement is a sign that, 
although investor sentiment remains cautious, confidence in real estate investing is beginning to 
improve relative to the prior year. Some of the capital flowing out of open-end funds may also  
be making its way to other commercial real estate strategies. Investors continue to rotate out of 
core and core-plus vehicles into opportunistic and value-add vehicles, as they increasingly  
opt for capital appreciation over income generation in a market where alternative sources of yield 
have grown more attractive.

to improve.

Fundraising strategies continue to expand
Beyond operations, GPs are expanding their real estate fundraising strategies out past traditional 
channels to tap high-net-worth investors and insurance capital—segments that have become 
increasingly central to capital formation. In this way, they have been able to diversify their LP base, 
unlock new sources of scale, and extend their fundraising runway. Similarly, they’re expanding 
their product offerings to include more real estate credit and special-situation strategies, often 
structured as soft-launch or multiasset vehicles. GPs are taking these actions to try to meet 
investors’ demand for flexibility, capitalize on bank retrenchment, and respond to growing 
investor appetite for dislocation-driven returns.

LPs: Repositioning in a shifting market
2024 was a mixed year for real estate returns, prompting many LPs to reassess their capital 
allocation strategy. 

Overall, real estate returns remained negative with a pooled IRR of –1.1 percent for the nine 
months ending September 30, 2024. Although 2024’s returns improved by five points from last 
year’s –6.4 percent, they remained well below the ten-year average of 6.9 percent, as measured 
by Burgiss, which calculates fund-level returns in closed-end vehicles.12

In the United States, the NCREIF Property Index posted positive total returns of 0.6 percent, 
compared with –7.6 percent in 2023. The improvement in performance was driven by  
a rebound in appreciation (–4.0 percent, compared with –11.5 percent in the prior year) and 
higher income returns (4.8 percent, compared with 4.3 percent in the prior year). 

The performance of open-end funds in the United States continued to suffer in 2024. NCREIF’s 
NFI-OE funds posted a gross return of –1.6 percent, only the second negative annual return for 
the sector since the global financial crisis.

Braced for shifting weatherAlternative sectors are getting more mainstream
By contrast, alternative sectors like data centers, manufactured housing, and senior housing 
continued to outperform traditional sectors for the third consecutive year, extending a decade-
long trend (with the exception of 2021) (Exhibit 4). In 2024, data centers posted an 11.2 percent 
return, whereas manufactured housing and senior housing achieved 11.7 percent and 5.6 percent 
returns, respectively. 

Traditional sectors have delivered strong and stable performance over time—but today, the most 
compelling opportunities are emerging in alternative sectors where few institutional managers 
currently operate. Aside from data centers, cold storage, medical-office buildings, and senior 
housing are among the sectors gaining traction with industry players. Despite historical 
outperformance, these and other alternative sectors remain underrepresented in most 
institutional real estate portfolios. Managers that have succeeded in such alternative  
sectors have done so by building dedicated platforms, recognizing that the operational 
complexity of these assets demands specialized capabilities.

Braced for shifting weatherLPs continue to raise the bar
In our work with global LPs, we’ve observed a sharp pivot toward more focused and strategic 
deployment of capital. Rather than pursuing broad diversification, many LPs are putting capital 
behind bold, conviction-driven thematic ideas such as decarbonization of the built environment, 
digital infrastructure, and demographic shifts—areas that represent targeted and impact-oriented 
opportunities. Additionally, LPs are increasingly favoring managers that can bridge the full 
breadth of their platforms, integrating capabilities across real estate, infrastructure, and credit, 
so allowing them to respond to complex, cross-sector investment theses with agility.  
LPs also continue to consolidate their relationships and work with fewer, more strategic  
partners. Skin in the game continues to matter deeply: LPs increasingly expect GPs  
to co-invest meaningful capital from their balance sheet to assess manager conviction and  
long-term commitment.

Headwinds persisted through 2024 for commercial real estate and impeded a full recovery. 
However, these pressures also highlighted areas of resilience across the asset class. Deal 
activity picked up modestly, cap rates began to stabilize in some sectors, and alternative sectors 
continued to deliver stronger relative performance. Especially amid evolving macroeconomic 
conditions, real estate’s bright spots point to early signs of recalibration—although the path to 
recovery is likely to remain uneven across sectors and geographies.

43

Braced for shifting weatherPrivate debt 
remains steady in 
the crosswinds

Private debt, once again, proved to be a resilient asset class  
in 2024. 

44

Braced for shifting weatherPrivate new-issue financing for leveraged buyouts (LBOs) increased in the United States  
and Europe in 2024, fueled by robust transaction activity in private equity buyouts amid a more 
benign borrowing environment compared with prior years. And although global private debt 
fundraising decreased by 22 percent to $166 billion, the rate of decline was lower compared with 
other private market asset classes—and was largely driven by the mezzanine substrategy. 

Private debt is going through a period of evolution. For many years, growth in the asset class, 
particularly in the direct lending strategy, was driven by banks’ retreat from leveraged lending. In 
2024, banks’ and syndicated lenders’ share of total financing increased—with more willingness 
from banks to take on risk. Average spreads in direct lending, the largest private debt substrategy, 
compressed by approximately 150 basis points to settle at about 550 basis points over base 
rates. While direct lending continued to lead new-issue LBO financing in terms of deal value and 
count, its share of global private debt deal value declined year over year. 

Amid these shifts, investor interest in private debt remains strong. In uncertain market conditions, 
the security derived from debt’s privileged position in the capital structure has appealed to 
institutional investors, as well as retail and insurance capital pools that continued to flow into 
private debt strategies in 2024. Further, investors expect the private credit ecosystem to 
continue expanding as more asset classes transition to nonbank lenders.

New opportunities are also emerging for managers. Over $620 billion in high-yield bonds and 
leveraged loans, for example, are set to approach maturity in 2026 to 2027, which could create 
refinancing opportunities and spur greater demand for private credit solutions.1 To position 
themselves well for the future, managers should remain disciplined in their underwriting, build 
capabilities in new asset classes, tap alternative capital sources, and translate geopolitical  
risks into credit opportunities.

In this report, we focus on direct lending and adjacent strategies (for example, special situations 
and mezzanine, distressed, and venture debt), excluding segments such as public or quasi- 
public credit, structured credit products, balance sheet lending by regulated institutions, and 
fund-level or sponsor financing.

Dealmakers: Growth in private debt issuance 
Comprehensive data on private debt deal volumes across strategies and geographies is often 
limited by the opaque nature of activity in this space. In sponsored direct lending (private  
loans made to PE-backed companies), available data suggests that new private debt issuance  
for LBOs increased by 30 percent year over year in the United States and Europe combined.  
The uptick was mostly a result of an increase in LBO transactions (global buyout deal value  
was up 16 percent in 2024) due to lower borrowing costs and improvement in the global 
economic outlook. 

1  “2025 credit outlook: Defying gravity,” Apollo Global Management, January 14, 2025.

45

Braced for shifting weatherOur analysis points to four global trends in dealmaking: declining financing spreads, a shift in 
LBO financing toward syndicated lenders, private debt GPs increasingly tapping insurers  
and other forms of permanent capital, and the expansion of the private debt’s footprint amid 
regulatory changes. 

Financing spreads decline 
Overall spreads declined across financing channels in 2024. In direct lending, spreads reached 
their lowest level since 2021, as banks and syndicated lenders returned to the market amid more 
favorable macroeconomic conditions. 

Direct lending spreads compressed by 120 basis points, to 550 basis points. Meanwhile, spreads 
in broadly syndicated loans (BSLs) fell 100 basis points, to 370 basis points (Exhibit 1). 

The difference between syndicated and direct lending spreads narrowed to around 180 basis 
points, down 19 percent from its 2022 peak of 221 basis points. The narrowing gap between  
the two strategies suggests that a more competitive financing market may be reducing private 
debt’s premium.

Braced for shifting weatherLeveraged-buyout financing shifts toward syndicated lenders
Direct lenders lost some market share to syndicated lenders in 2024. Direct lending’s share  
of new-issue LBO financings decreased from 88 percent to 84 percent in deal count and from 
64 percent to 54 percent in deal value. The decline was partially due to the type of deals 
transacted: Larger LBO deals (greater than $500 million) grew in value faster than smaller LBO 
deals. Since syndicated lenders typically have a greater capacity to make large investments 
given their ability to syndicate risk across multiple parties, they provided 46 percent of financing 
but just 16 percent of deals (Exhibit 2). 

Private debt managers tap more insurance and other permanent capital sources
Insurance capital and other permanent capital vehicles (for example, business development 
companies [BDCs], and interval funds) remain increasingly prominent sources of capital for 
private debt GPs. 

Private debt is particularly well suited to insurers due to its predictable cash flows, long duration, and 
risk-adjusted returns, all while allowing insurers to remain within regulatory guidelines. BDCs 
and interval funds, on the other hand, provide retail investors with access to private debt, but the

regulations. These vehicles are an increasingly popular source of financing: For BDCs tracked  
by Fitch, for example, unsecured debt issuances nearly tripled from 2023 to 2024, reaching an 
all-time high.2

Private debt expands its footprint amid regulatory reform
Over the past decade, regulatory changes have increasingly constrained banks’ lending practices, 
leading more middle-market companies to seek nonbank financing. For example, Basel IV— 
the finalized reforms of the Basel III framework—will require banks to increase capital reserves in 
a range of lending areas and may include new rules focused on liquidity (which could reduce 
banks’ appetite for longer-duration loans). The reforms could also constrain banks’ use of internal 
models and raise capital floors, limiting flexibility in the higher risk-weighted-asset segments 
such as commercial real estate and specialized credit. 

Banks are also increasingly partnering with private debt GPs to gain exposure to economic 
activities that they hope to finance by becoming originators and distributors rather than  
end owners of risk. We also observe GPs proactively seeking out such partnerships with banks. 
As regulations continue to evolve, they will shape the future landscape of nonbank lending, 
including in middle-market financing, where borrowers rely on flexible, long-duration capital.

In 2024, private debt managers deployed capital beyond midsize and highly leveraged businesses 
into a broader range of asset types in search of downside protection and diversification. In 
particular, four asset classes could increasingly shift to nonbank lenders. These include asset-
backed finance segments with higher-risk-adjusted yields (for example, aircraft loans),  
long-duration infrastructure and project finance assets, residential mortgages classified as 
“nonconforming” under bank regulations, and high-risk commercial real estate.3 Each  
of these asset types ranks highly on at least one of three criteria that contribute to banks’ 
propensity to transition them off their balance sheets (Exhibit 3).

Banks are increasingly partnering  
with private debt GPs to gain exposure 
to economic activities that they hope  
to finance by becoming originators and 
distributors rather than end owners  
of risk.

origination and underwriting capabilities specific to these new asset classes, including asset-
backed finance, project finance, and real estate debt. They can also diversify capital bases  
to include longer-duration or lower-return-threshold capital pools, driving broader participation 
across the risk/return spectrum.

Braced for shifting weatherFundraisers: Direct lending remains strong amid a cooling market
Global private debt fundraising decreased by 22 percent to $166 billion (Exhibit 4). Despite this 
decline, 2024 was the fifth-largest fundraising year ever for the asset class. In contrast, 
fundraising for direct lending—the largest private credit strategy—grew by 2 percent year over 
year to $122 billion, the third-highest annual total on record. Growth in direct lending has been 
underway for more than a decade. Investors have committed capital for direct lending strategies 
in search of high floating-rate yields, with downside protection offered by a senior position in  
the capital stack. 

On the other hand, mezzanine fundraising fell by more than 80 percent, accounting for $33 billion 
of the $47 billion aggregate decline in private debt fundraising in 2024. Fund timing is likely to 
have affected annual fundraising value for the substrategy, in which high manager concentration 
makes fundraising intrinsically more volatile. Just one of the ten largest mezzanine fundraisers  
of the last decade raised mezzanine capital in 2024 (compared with five in 2023 and three each 
in 2022 and 2021). However, some LPs are increasingly questioning whether mezzanine funds 
continue to offer compelling risk-adjusted returns, given narrowing spreads and more attractive 
opportunities elsewhere in private credit.

Fundraising declined across geographies as well. In North America, which accounts for over  
half of the global private debt fundraising total, fundraising fell by 18 percent in 2024, although it 
still grew at a 9 percent CAGR over the past five years. In contrast, Europe and Asia saw sharper 
one-year declines of 30 percent and 43 percent, respectively. Both regions also posted negative 
five-year CAGRs of –6 percent and –18 percent.

Two notable themes emerged in our analysis of 2024’s private debt fundraising numbers: 
increased manager concentration and a steady investor appetite. 

Global private debt fundraising 
decreased by 22 percent to $166 billion. 
Despite this decline, 2024 was  
the fifth-largest fundraising year  
ever for the asset class.

Braced for shifting weatherPrivate-debt fundraising is growing more concentrated 
Fundraising concentration in private debt is gradually increasing. In 2024, the top five managers 
raised 38 percent of private debt funds, a notable increase from 29 percent in 2023 and the ten-
year average of 29 percent (Exhibit 5). 

Scale can often be a source of competitive advantage in the private debt industry. Lenders  
with greater financial resources can offer borrowers a range of financing solutions, provide 
timely liquidity, and maintain larger positions across different capital segments without incurring 
excessive concentration risk. The ability of larger lenders to lead a facility through scaled 
commitments can also be advantageous in deal access and deal terms. Moreover, GPs that  
have scale are better able to invest in building the incremental capabilities (for example,  
in operations or technology) required to attract alternative capital sources, such as retail and 
insurance capital.

Braced for shifting weatherInvestor appetite holds steady
Although fundraising fell in 2024, McKinsey’s 2025 LP Survey reveals that investor appetite for 
private debt remains strong. Forty-three percent of the surveyed LPs say they expect to increase 
private debt target allocations over the next 12 months—more than the share that expressed a 
desire to invest more in private equity or real estate. Investors’ interest in the asset class is largely 
driven by private debt’s perceived superior risk-adjusted returns and investors’ desire for 
portfolio diversification. 

LPs: Subdued but consistent performance
The pooled net IRR for private debt in 2024 was 6.6 percent (this figure is annualized based  
on an IRR of 4.9 percent in the first three quarters of the year). Despite subdued returns, private 
debt outperformed private equity and real estate in 2024 and continues to attract LPs with  
its low return dispersion and absolute returns comparable to real estate, infrastructure, and 
natural resources.

Dispersion of returns remained low among private debt managers. The median IRR and 
percentile spreads for 2012 to 2021 vintage funds, as of September 2024, reveal that private 
debt managers continued to provide investors with a narrower spread of returns relative  
to other asset classes. There was a 4.7 percent difference between top- and bottom-quartile 
private debt performance, compared with the 15 percent spread in private equity and  
8 percent spread in infrastructure (Exhibit 6).

Braced for shifting weatherDefault rates remain low—for now 
According to available data on private debt defaults, which is often not comprehensive, the 
default rate in the asset class has historically been low (leading to lower losses), but it increased 
marginally in 2024. 

In 2024, Proskauer’s Private Credit Default Index rose to approximately 2.7 percent in the fourth 
quarter, compared with 1.8 percent in the first quarter.4 In comparison, broadly syndicated  
loans posted a 4.7 percent default rate as of year-end 2024, up from 4 percent at the beginning 
of the year.5

The difference between the default rates for the two strategies may be the result of private debt 
managers adopting superior risk management strategies, demonstrating an ability to better 
manage total returns compared with their counterparts in both syndicated and public markets. 
But default-driven losses could begin to rise, especially if the global economy enters a 
recessionary environment. Meanwhile, a higher-for-longer interest rate outlook and intensifying 
competition for deal flow could lead to riskier underwriting and more defaults.

In the coming years, private debt could play an increasingly prominent role in lending against 
distressed and opportunistic hard assets, as well as asset-backed lending in nontraditional 
sectors. This strategic diversification will likely highlight the ability of private debt GPs to prioritize 
yield generation while retaining downside protection—key strengths of the asset class—and 
further solidify private debt as not only a resilient but also an adaptable asset class.

5 “ BSL posts strong returns in 2024 amid robust investor demand,” LSTA, January 9, 2025. Default rate reflects defaults by 

count, inclusive of liability management transactions, as reported by LSTA. Definitions and inclusion criteria for defaults may 
vary across sources.

Braced for shifting weatherInfrastructure 
poised for clearer 
conditions 

The infrastructure asset class had a mixed year, with robust  
deal activity and stronger relative performance on the one  
hand and slower fundraising on the other. 

55

Braced for shifting weatherFrom one perspective, 2024 may have seemed like a tougher year than 2023 was for infrastructure 
leaders. Fundraising was down again, falling 15 percent year over year to become the lowest  
in a decade. GPs spent more time on the fundraising trail compared with the prior year. And the 
capital-raising environment appeared less welcoming to newcomers than ever before. 

However, there are several reasons to believe that the asset class is inching closer to a full 
recovery. Capital deployment accelerated in 2024. Deal value increased by 18 percent over the 
prior year, making 2024 the second-highest year on record (behind 2022). Our analysis suggests 
that dealmakers also executed bigger deals, since deal count increased only 7 percent over 
2023. This active deployment resulted in dry powder decreasing to $418 billion as of the first half 
of 2024, which was 10 percent lower than that at the end of 2023.

Infrastructure also appears to be the asset class in which the greatest number of investors want 
to increase allocations in the next 12 months (selected by 46 percent of the total respondents), 
according to the McKinsey LP Survey.1 There are several reasons for this bullish view. Global trade, 
which grew to nearly $33 trillion in 2024,2 has spurred major public and private investments in 
ports, rail, and logistic infrastructure. The global energy transition continues to require trillions of 
dollars’ worth of investment into infrastructure: McKinsey’s research shows that the total of  
new physical assets for clean energy and enabling infrastructure could reach approximately  
$6.5 trillion per year by 2050.3

Then there are demographic shifts: growth in population (expected to increase by nearly two 
billion in the next 30 years) and wealth ($160 trillion in wealth created in the past two decades),4 
which will likely boost demand for infrastructure, especially critical sectors like roads and energy. 
At the same time, the demand for power is also rising. In the United States, for instance, retail 
sale of electricity increased by 2 percent in 2024 from a year prior, after 15 years of near-flat 
growth, due in large part to growing electricity needs of data centers (with the power demand  
being accelerated by the use of AI and cloud computing).5

To capitalize on these opportunities in the current market environment, infrastructure managers 
are also changing how they invest—and generate returns. In previous years, infrastructure  
GPs tended to invest in distinct infrastructure verticals. Now we observe heightened investment 
at the intersection of different themes (energy and digital for data centers being a notable 
example). At the same time, greater competition for assets and the end of an extended period  
of “cheap money” is making active ownership increasingly important—if not essential—to  
drive returns. Value-oriented infrastructure GPs that are willing to focus on and underwrite  
value creation initiatives could gain strong competitive differentiation, given the sustained  
LP interest in committing to the strategy.

Braced for shifting weatherDealmakers and operators: Regaining their stride 
Infrastructure dealmaking rebounded in 2024 as GPs accelerated their pace of capital 
deployment. Globally, more deals were done, and they were made at higher prices. Deal value 
increased by 18 percent, while deal count increased by 7 percent during the year. 

Several infrastructure subsectors recorded robust deal activity. Deals in the telecom sector 
accounted for 16 percent of aggregate infrastructure deals by value in 2024, up from 3 percent  
in 2015 (Exhibit 1). This growth was primarily driven by rising demand for fiber networks and  
data centers. In fact, data centers composed 58 percent of telecom deals, compared with only  
2 percent in 2015.

Braced for shifting weatherRenewable energy (from sources including wind, solar, biomethane, and biomass) also continued to 
be a core investment theme, representing 22 percent of infrastructure deal value in 2024, slightly 
above the sector’s ten-year average of 21 percent. Although transport continued to hold the 
largest share of deal value (roughly 22 percent), the sector’s margin has considerably decreased 
over the past decade (in 2015, it accounted for 46 percent of deal value).

Our analysis highlights three main trends for infrastructure dealmakers and operators to 
consider: convergence of energy and digital, emphasis on value creation, and increase in 
investment in services.

Convergence of energy and digital
In the infrastructure sector, the clearest example of the so-called hybridization of assets is 
between energy and digital (such as with data centers).6 The proliferation of AI and cloud 
computing has increased the demand for power substantially. In 2024, the demand for data 
center power was 66 gigawatts. A proprietary McKinsey demand model projects it to reach  
219 gigawatts by 2030, reflecting a 22 percent annual growth rate. Data center owners and 
operators will likely need to upgrade their existing transmission and distribution infrastructure  
to meet this growing power demand. 

Many GPs are also looking at building or acquiring data centers in new markets where power  
is more abundant (for example, Indiana in the United States and Brazil). At the same time, 
infrastructure managers are paying more attention than ever to renewable generation, small 
modular reactors, behind-the-meter energy storage, and (for now) natural gas to power  
these centers. Consider the example of Cumulus Data Assets in the United States, a 
960-megawatt data center campus that is powered by a nuclear power plant adjacent to the 
facility and was sold to a cloud service provider.7

Emphasis on value creation
Our work with infrastructure investors reveals that dealmakers are increasingly focusing on 
active ownership of assets to generate value and deliver desired returns to investors. Successful 
GPs are pursuing several priorities beyond traditional value creation planning with their portfolio 
companies. Notably, GPs can manage project timelines through careful strategic planning to 
optimize capital deployment, prevent costly delays, and maximize asset value, especially in an 
environment where project delays are increasingly penalized with fees. 

The issue of labor management is an important aspect of strategic planning. Dealmakers and 
operators could tackle the challenge of a lack of skilled labor—particularly in the United States—
by boosting productivity (for example, through automation), focusing on retaining and upskilling 
talent, and creating flexibility across geographies (for example, by using digital twins and remote 
controls) so that skilled labor can participate in projects remotely.

Increase in investment in services
Infrastructure GPs and LPs are increasingly recognizing that service businesses can often have 
infrastructure-like attributes. For example, service businesses can be critical to various value 
chains (such as maintenance services to the water utility value chain) and often resemble 

6 “ Hybridization of assets” refers to bringing together two key investment themes or subsectors, allowing investors to have 

exposure to multiple themes through a single asset.

driven by mission-critical spending (for example, supporting the energy transition by shifting  
to more cold storage), and exhibit high barriers to entry due to the need for scale. As a result, the 
definition of an “infrastructure asset” is fast expanding to include not just hard assets but also 
maintenance of data centers and telecom assets, pipeline inspections, and more. 

Fundraisers: Facing ongoing hurdles
2024 was undeniably a tough year to be fundraising for infrastructure and natural resources. An 
aggregate $106 billion was globally raised for the asset class, down by 15 percent from 2023, 
becoming the lowest amount raised in the past decade (Exhibit 2). The number of infrastructure

the market for longer, reaching a record high of 26 months, nine months longer than it took just 
five years ago. The proportion of dollars raised by first-time funds also declined to its lowest ever, 
making up only 1 percent of all fundraising in 2024. 

Some of these declines could likely be due to scale. Larger funds tend to influence fundraising to 
a great extent in infrastructure (Exhibit 3). And in 2024, two of the largest historical fundraisers  
in the asset class did not close a fund. Both GPs, in addition to around ten other funds, are now in 
the market targeting funds of over $10 billion or similar size.

Braced for shifting weatherIn 2024, Europe experienced a 40 percent year-over-year increase in fundraising. Meanwhile in 
North America, fundraising declined by 57 percent year over year. Both of these large swings in 
fundraising may be attributed to the timing of funds coming to market.

Two key trends stand out as we look at the infrastructure fundraising landscape: the sector 
increasing its demand for value-added strategies and limited partners embracing more risk for 
superior returns.

Increasing demand for value-added strategies 
Value-added vehicles accounted for 34 percent of total infrastructure fundraising in 2024 (the 
ten-year trailing average is 19 percent), buoyed by increasing LP interest in the strategy (Exhibit 4). 
On the other hand, debt and core-plus strategies lost momentum. Fundraising for core-plus 
vehicles accounted for 13 percent of the total, lower than the ten-year average of 29 percent. 
Meanwhile, infrastructure debt fundraising fell to 4 percent against a ten-year average of 9 percent. 
These patterns are indicative of LPs increasingly moving further along the risk-reward spectrum  
to meet their return expectations. Given the shift toward value-added investing, GPs may do well 
to focus on greater active management of assets.

Infrastructure was the top-performing private asset class in 2024, with a one-year pooled net 
IRR of 6.1 percent, compared with 8.5 percent in 2023. Even so, 2024 marked the asset class’s 
weakest performance since 2011 (infrastructure has generated an approximately 9 percent 
annual average since 2000).

As LPs search for superior returns, they are increasingly seeking higher-risk opportunities. 
Brownfield and greenfield infrastructure projects, for example, accounted for 52 percent of 
infrastructure deals—the highest proportion on record—and a 20 percent gain against secondary-
stage projects over the past seven years. This may suggest that GPs are increasingly buying 
based on the underlying asset value and potential appreciation as opposed to consistent  
cash flows.

The long-term appeal of infrastructure continues to remain robust as well. In the McKinsey LP 
Survey, 46 percent of respondents indicate a desire to increase allocation to infrastructure over 
the next 12 months (versus 43 percent a year ago)—the highest for all private capital asset 
classes (Exhibit 5). This is despite LPs being overallocated to infrastructure by approximately half 
a percentage point, according to CEM Benchmarking.

Braced for shifting weatherIn the McKinsey LP Survey, 44 percent of the respondents say that they plan to increase their 
allocations to the infrastructure value-added strategy, more than they report for any other 
infrastructure strategy. Within LP groups, pension funds have the highest targeted allocation  
to infrastructure, as they are attracted to the more predictable returns of the asset class. 
Meanwhile, respondents from family offices (a relatively smaller contributor to overall 
infrastructure assets under management compared with other LP groups) show the greatest 
desire to increase target allocations over the next 12 months. Their heightened appetite  
is likely driven by a willingness to accept longer hold periods and lower need for short-term 
liquidity, compared with other investors. 

Infrastructure endured some challenges along its path to recovery in 2024. Yet stakeholders’ 
conviction in the asset class remains undeniably strong, as evidenced by increasing deployment 
from GPs and LPs’ desire to allocate more capital. This may well be because the secular drivers  
of infrastructure investment opportunities (more people, more activity, and limited government 
balance sheets) are strengthening, not diminishing. With expanding definitions of “infrastructure” 
and “hybridization of assets,” an elevated need to increase performance and return capital to 
LPs, and continued challenges in the deal environment, value creation through active ownership 
has emerged as a key tenet of success for infrastructure investors, a theme that will likely 
persist into the future.

more alternative: The rise 
of novel AUM forms 

Nontraditional sources of capital are accounting for a growing share of 
private markets’ assets under management (AUM). Here’s why. 

65

Braced for shifting weatherFor many years, asset managers and investors have generally used a single metric to track the 
inexorable rise and health of private markets: assets under management. As the thinking goes, if 
investors are giving private managers access to more and more capital, they probably trust that 
their investment decisions are valid and that private markets are stable. That view of AUM may 
require some rethinking, however. 

Between 2000 and 2023, total AUM across private market asset classes increased almost 
20-fold, reflecting CAGR of 13 percent—even factoring in leaner times for private markets in 
2022 and 2023.1

However, AUM for private markets grew by just 1 percent between year-end 2023 and the first 
three-quarters of 2024. This slowed growth, however, accounts for only those assets managed 
within closed-end commingled investment vehicles. It fails to take into account an alternative 
segment in private markets comprising a range of nontraditional forms of capital that reflects 
potentially more than half the scale of the AUM of closed-end funds.

The real measure of AUM needs to account for this alternative segment. For the purposes of this 
article, we consider three types of nontraditional capital that have become popular in recent 
years: higher-liquidity products, such as open-end funds; LP demand-driven products, such as 
separately managed accounts (SMAs) and co-investments; and permanent capital, such as 
insurance capital.

According to our analysis, these three sources of capital contributed approximately $7 trillion  
to $8 trillion in AUM in 2024, nearly 20 percent higher than in the prior year. And when this figure 
is incorporated in the overall AUM for private markets in 2024, that number increases by  
5 or 6 percent. Consequently, the size of the private market industry in 2024 is also increased  
by nearly 50 percent to approximately $22 trillion. 

In this article, we explore the growing shift to alternative forms of private capital—and what GPs 
can do to tap into this trend.

Why are alternative sources of capital proliferating?
Although traditional AUM remains the bread and butter of the typical GP (and core to GP 
economics), alternative capital pools are increasingly gaining traction for three main reasons. 
GPs and regulators are democratizing access to private markets for retail investors, and  
they are developing more customized investment solutions for institutional investors beyond  
the commingled fund model. At the same time, the private market universe is also expanding, 
with a greater number of new managers and active firms. 

Retail capital pools 
Historically, many capital pools, particularly retail investors, couldn’t access private capital 
opportunities due to regulatory restrictions, minimum requirements for check size, and liquidity 
constraints when it came to investing using commingled fund structures. Over the past few  

1   Figures are for traditional AUM, which includes closed-end commingled vehicles. Private market asset classes include 

infrastructure and natural resources, private debt, private equity, and real estate.

66

the bread and butter of the typical GP, 
alternative capital pools are increasingly 
gaining traction.

years, GPs have addressed these challenges by setting up nontraditional vehicles and innovative 
fund structures that retail investors can access more easily—a growing and largely untapped 
pool of nearly $60 trillion.2

Governments around the world have also democratized access to private markets by easing 
regulations in recent years. Regulatory changes allowing 401(k) plans to invest in alternative 
investment funds were introduced in the United States in 2020, giving a broader group of 
investors access to opportunities for private capital investment. Countries in Europe introduced 
similar regulatory changes, including an update to the European Long-Term Investment Fund 
regulation that took effect in 2024. These primarily long-term investment funds allow for greater 
retail access than typical closed-end funds do. 

Still, many retail investors have found it challenging to overcome regulatory and logistical 
obstacles, such as minimum qualifications to invest in alternative investments and large minimum 
commitments to invest in funds. Supply-side innovation has helped some retail investors 
overcome these barriers. For example, there are aggregators that connect a network of wealth 
managers with private-capital-fund products. They help wealth managers access private  
capital products for their clients and assist private capital firms with the operational challenges 
of having a large, segmented LP base. There has also been an increase in the number of fund 
administration services available, with capabilities specifically suited to managing the financial 
and accounting needs of funds with a large number of investors—particularly retail investors. 

Customized investment solutions for LPs 
Many GPs are also developing new offerings for large institutional investors, giving them greater 
customization, exposure, influence, and liquidity than closed-end commingled vehicles provide. 
Some institutional investors are tailoring their private market exposures so that they have greater 
choice and direction over their investments. For example, some LPs are creating multibillion-
dollar joint ventures with trusted GPs to deploy capital toward achieving their strategic goals 
(such as energy transition efforts and regional development) and gain benefits of scale. 

Expanding the private market universe 
Alternative sources of capital are also proliferating alongside growth in new managers and 
investment theses. Consider these statistics: Although the number of first-time buyout  
funds declined in 2024, there are now more than 17,000 private market firms active globally, 

2 Performance Lens Global Growth Cube, McKinsey, accessed March 2025.

Braced for shifting weatherwhich is 2.4 times more than a decade ago. Moreover, the number of active firms has increased 
every year for the past ten years across all asset classes and geographies. This increase in the 
private market universe is pushing GPs to widen their capital pools to maintain a strong footing. 

What value is at stake?
Alternative sources of capital can take many forms, but the three highlighted in our analysis—
higher liquidity products, LP demand-driven products, and permanent capital—show the 
greatest popularity and promise. Despite the lack of transparent data on alternative sources  
of capital, our analysis reveals that these three are estimated to have added $7 trillion to  
$8 trillion to the overall global private capital AUM in 2024, bringing the aggregate AUM to 
approximately $22 trillion (Exhibit 1).

Braced for shifting weatherGrowth in nontraditional capital has also outpaced traditional AUM growth in recent years, 
increasing an estimated 16 to 18 percent annually since 2020, compared with 10 percent growth 
in traditional AUM. The gap widened in 2024, when alternative capital sources grew between  
18 and 20 percent, while traditional capital registered tepid growth of just 1 percent.

In reviewing various forms of alternative capital for our analysis, we carefully considered a range 
of factors. To avoid the double counting of capital, our private capital AUM figures don’t include 
primary or secondary funds of funds. These vehicles represent an estimated additional $2 trillion 
in AUM that has grown by nearly 8 percent per year since 2020—driven partly by the surging 
interest in secondaries, which hit an all-time high in 2024. 

Additionally, liquid-alternative funds (which include select mutual funds and ETFs, as well as 
some closed-end funds) are highly liquid products by alternative investment standards.  
They aren’t truly private, and many of the strategies that they encompass (such as long-short 
equity strategies, derivative strategies, and many commodities strategies) fall outside our 
definition of “private capital.” These represent approximately $1 trillion in additional AUM and 
have grown at approximately 10 percent annually since 2020. Similarly, we don’t include  
public business development companies and public real estate investment trusts (given that  
they are public vehicles). However, they are worth noting, as they invest in private assets,  
similar to their private counterparts. Additionally, we haven’t included AUM contribution from 
hedge funds in our analysis.

Higher-liquidity products
Higher-liquidity products are vehicles that are open-ended or provide intermittent liquidity to 
investors. Retail investors that need higher (and more frequent) liquidity ideally want private market 
returns with public-market liquidity. For more traditional LPs, such as pension funds and family 
offices, the increased liquidity provided can play a vital role in overall portfolio construction.

Higher-liquidity vehicles include the following:

 — evergreen funds that are open-ended limited-partnership fund structures

 — real estate investment trusts that aren’t traded on an exchange

 — interval funds, which are intermittent-liquidity strategies that must provide monthly or 

quarterly liquidity

 — tender offer funds, which are similar to interval funds but leave the liquidity to  

manager discretion

 — BDCs that aren’t traded on any exchange, which are less liquid than public BDCs are  

and typically operate similarly to other intermittent-liquidity vehicles but still lend funds to 
small and mid-size businesses like public BDCs do

Across these fund structures, we estimate that there’s $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion in AUM, which has 
grown at approximately 16 percent per year since 2020. Additionally, these products contribute  
an estimated $250 billion to $600 billion in fund investments and co-investment, indicating an 
even broader impact of higher-liquidity vehicles than by direct AUM alone. 

69

Braced for shifting weatherProducts driven by LP demand
LP demand-driven offerings, including SMAs and co-investments, give LPs greater (or more 
direct) control over, exposure to, and influence on the investment of funds. GPs often use them to 
deepen their relationships with investors.

An SMA is a customized vehicle through which a single LP typically commits capital. By offering 
multiple SMAs, GPs often garner larger commitments than they would otherwise receive.  
Based on our analysis, the AUM dedicated to SMAs was between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion in 
2024 and up by 16 to 18 percent per year since 2020. 

LPs are also interested in co-investment opportunities because they can double down on their 
exposure to particular investments and reduce their fee payments in the process. Through  
these co-investments, GPs can also make bigger investments than the fund size alone would 
allow. The AUM driven by co-investment has increased by 20 to 25 percent per year since  
2020 and totaled more than $2.5 trillion in 2024. 

Permanent capital
Permanent capital is largely sourced from insurance companies. Historically, insurance 
companies have allocated a portion of their assets to alternative investments, most typically 
those assets that were expected to be held for a long period of time. More recently, however, 
leading GPs have started acquiring insurance business units with the intention of using the 
insurer’s long-held assets on the balance sheet as a pool of permanent capital that could be 
allocated for private capital investments. 

In addition, insurers not backed by private capital firms are also increasingly investing in funds, 
permanent-capital entities, private placements, and “sidecars,” among other modes of entry. On 
top of investments into fund structures previously discussed (such as open-ended funds),  
the size of private capital AUM from these insurance capital pools is estimated to be $1.5 trillion 
to $2 trillion, up by nearly 10 percent annually since 2020. This estimate doesn’t include an 
additional $2 trillion of insurance assets invested in fund structures and managed private market 
products—primarily traditional, closed-end vehicles. 

What’s the path forward for GPs? 
Given the shifts in the composition of private capital fundraising and AUM, GPs must begin  
to adapt their fundraising and investor relations efforts. There are two ways by which GPs  
can set themselves up for success: by restructuring and growing their fundraising team and  
by switching to a solution mindset. 

Restructure and grow the fundraising team
GPs can increase the size of their fundraising team and ensure it sources capital from both 
mainstream and alternative sources (for example, traditional versus SMAs and pension  
funds versus retail investors). The team must also actively seek out LPs that have had less 
exposure to private capital. Indeed, early movers are already building out armies of  
fundraisers to educate potential investors on the options now available to them, ensuring  
that their products are seen and understood. These new fundraising activities can  
include a mix of insourced and outsourced capabilities.

70

Braced for shifting weatherSwitch from a fundraising to a solution mindset
For more tailored products, such as SMAs and co-investments, GPs can curate a team dedicated 
to the specializations. The team would understand its target LPs’ distinct goals and problems 
and offer appropriate solutions. Since extra resourcing is likely to compress GPs’ margins, they 
would do well to become more efficient in their back office and benefit from economies of scale.

The story of the rise in alternative investments is one of how managers are excelling at supply 
side innovation to sustain—and boost—demand from a range of investors. In this shifting 
landscape, using only traditional AUM as a proxy for total private market AUM is akin to using 
manufacturing alone as a proxy for GDP: What about everything else? It will be critical  
for private market leaders to take these trends into account and expand their views on both 
traditional and nontraditional sources of capital.

to clearing the historic  
exit backlog

Exiting assets has become harder than ever before—but GPs  
can take some actionable steps to execute a sale in a timely and  
profitable manner.

72

Braced for shifting weatherPrivate equity (PE) sponsors are grappling with a ballooning exit problem.

Although 2024 saw a modest rise in the sales of private-equity-backed companies—up 8 percent 
by value after two consecutive years of decline—the global backlog of sponsor-owned assets  
in their divestment period, awaiting an exit,1 is bigger than at any point in the past two decades—in 
terms of value, count, and as a share of total portfolio companies. 

Consider these statistics. In 2024, more than 18,000 companies had been under PE ownership 
for more than four years—more than six times the number in 2005.2 This means that 61 percent of 
buyout-backed portfolio companies have been held beyond the four-year mark by sponsors.  
The average hold time for buyout assets was 6.7 years in 2024, a full year more than the 20-year 
average of 5.7 years. 

In 2024, we saw a mismatch in valuation expectations between buyers and sellers that led to 
several sales processes being halted. Many sponsors informally communicated to the market 
about the potential sale of several long-in-the-tooth assets, avoiding formal auction processes 
for fear that they would fail. 

In this article, we explore the steps GPs can take to increase the chances of their assets exiting in 
a timely and profitable manner. After all, while GPs are generally viewed as buyers of companies, 
it is the sale of these assets that delivers returns.

In 2024, more than 18,000 companies 
had been under PE ownership for 
more than four years—more than six 
times the number in 2005.

73

Braced for shifting weatherPrivate equity’s exit challenge
In 2024, the average PE sponsor owned more companies, valued higher, and held for longer 
relative to historical averages. The sponsors are anxious to sell these assets—both in good time 
and at attractive prices—for several reasons. For one, delays in selling companies have made 
fundraising challenging for GPs, as demonstrated in McKinsey’s Global Private Markets Report 
2025. Many LPs are withholding new commitments until they receive distributions, which exits 
enable. In our 2025 McKinsey LP Survey, 21 percent of respondents cited distributed to paid-in 
capital (DPI)3 as a critical performance metric when evaluating GPs, up from 8 percent three  
years ago (Exhibit 1). In fact, DPI is now tied with multiple on invested capital (MOIC)4 as the 
second-most-important performance metric after IRR.

In addition, extended holding periods due to a lack of suitable exits can jeopardize returns. This 
could be because returning the same IRR over a longer hold period requires GPs to generate  
a higher MOIC, placing a greater value creation burden on operators. This issue becomes more 
critical given that buyout entry multiples have nearly doubled in the past 15 years—investors  
are paying more to buy assets, which means they need to sell them at higher prices to deliver the 
same returns.

Braced for shifting weatherHowever, getting an exit right in the current market environment is no easy feat. A number of 
stalled exits in 2024 have added to growing pressure on GPs. This trend is not specific to PE; 
some corporate spin-offs also experienced stalled processes.

One factor looms large in explaining these exit challenges: a mismatch between buyer and seller 
price expectations. We can analyze this mismatch by evaluating how the valuations of maturing 
assets (for example, those held for more than four years) on sponsors’ books—typically termed as 
“marks”—compare with market-clearing prices as multiples of EBITDA for sponsor-owned 
companies in the same sector. In 2024, the marks of maturing assets were 17 percent above market-
clearing prices, according to Hamilton Lane (Exhibit 2). In comparison, the marks of maturing 
assets were only 4 percent and 3 percent above clearing prices in 2020 and 2018, respectively. 
Moreover, all PE subsectors tracked by Hamilton Lane showed uniform consistency in elevated 
marks in 2024, unlike in 2020 or 2018, when marks were elevated in select sectors.

Braced for shifting weatherWithin PE subsectors, consumer discretionary and technology assets showed the highest 
pricing mismatches, with average holding valuations as a percentage of market purchase prices 
at 129 percent and 126 percent, respectively. Even sectors with the lowest dislocations, such  
as healthcare and financials, were above the prevailing market prices in 2024, at 104 percent and 
105, respectively.

We have also observed that many PE assets traded in recent years are typically the highest-
quality assets that satisfy most of a prospective buyer’s ideal investment criteria. It is against this 
baseline that the elevated marks are measured. Put another way, the quality bar for marketable 
assets has gone up, and relatively few assets meet this bar.

Selling assets appears to be especially difficult for large sponsors, as they tend to buy bigger 
companies with more constrained exit options. Indeed, the bigger the company, the fewer sponsors 
or corporates that can purchase it (though IPOs are also an exit option for larger assets).

Preparing for an exit 
A tough environment for selling companies has made exit preparation even more vital. Drawing 
on our work with investors and previous McKinsey research, we have developed a playbook  
that GPs can use to optimize their exit preparations. The approaches vary principally based on 
the stage of the asset life cycle and the likely exit pathways. 

Stage of the asset life cycle
Leading GPs start thinking about the exit even before acquiring an asset. In our view, the best 
exit preparation is built into every stage of the investment life cycle, including the diligence 
process, the holding period, and the divestment stage. 

Diligence process. When assessing an asset’s quality during the diligence process, GPs could 
include evaluating the quality and feasibility of the exit. As such, GPs need to consider the exit 
potential for a target asset, including the likely market for the asset after a typical holding period 
and the most appropriate exit channel. Depending on the anticipated exit route, GPs can tailor 
their value creation efforts to tell a story that best suits that exit route.

Holding period. As owners turn their focus to value creation, the likely exit pathways can play  
a role in determining what gets prioritized. For example, some value creation initiatives may need 
to begin earlier than others to give the next owner confidence in underwriting these initiatives. 
Market expansion levers, for instance, may take longer to realize compared with cost-cutting 
levers. Early in the holding period, dealmakers and operators may need to think about the 
sequencing of value creation initiatives to prepare for the best exit. 

There are two distinct value creation plan (VCP) opportunities for an asset. First is the postclose 
VCP, which focuses on translating the investment thesis into a practical plan. This involves building 
a rigorous momentum case for the business, comprehensively assessing the full potential, and 
then developing a robust execution plan to close the gap between momentum and full potential. 

The second is the midcycle VCP, which is emerging as best practice in PE. A midcycle VCP can 
unlock a second S-curve of performance improvement after the impact of the postclose VCP has 
plateaued and the focus of dealmakers and operators has shifted to new assets. This midcycle 

76

Braced for shifting weatherplan could focus on improving performance across two to three actionable, high-impact levers. 
The choice of levers is critical; there needs to be enough time to show at least the green shoots  
of impact, and they should be chosen to align with what the next owner values, be that a strategic 
buyer, another sponsor, or the public markets. These midcycle VCPs are most often successful 
when run alongside a midcycle re-underwrite. In a midcycle re-underwrite, the sponsor can refresh 
its view on market evolution and incorporate fresh perspectives into the VCP.

At exit. GPs can prepare an equity story that reflects all the value creation efforts done to 
improve the asset’s performance. For example, they can not only highlight the asset’s 
performance and any changes it has undergone during the holding period but also show the 
groundwork laid for the next one to two horizons of value creation. This may boost the 
confidence of potential owners, who are likely considering their own potential exit paths, that  
the next exit can also be successful.

Likely exit pathway
PE GPs can determine the likely buyer type based on the characteristics of the asset. For 
example, larger assets could be better suited for public flotation than smaller ones, as the bigger 
the company, the fewer the sponsors or companies able to purchase it. Indeed, IPOs accounted  
for 22 percent of global PE-backed exits for assets valued at or above $500 million in 2024, 
compared with 10 percent for smaller exits (below $500 million).

Next, we explain potential approaches for the three most common exit channels in PE. 

Strategic or corporate buyer. Early on, GPs can determine potential strategic buyers for an 
asset—a short list of companies in a specific industry that are capable of transacting within a given 
deal size range and where synergies are clear. By doing so, GPs can focus their value creation 
efforts and investment on the products or business units within a portfolio company that would be 
the best strategic fit for potential strategic buyers. For example, they could invest in business 
units with the highest expected synergies or those in the most complementary geographies.

Sponsor-to-sponsor exits. GPs should consider how they communicate the uncaptured value 
creation potential of an asset. This is especially important because GP buyers, in particular, need 
to confidently underwrite profitable growth in the asset during a typical holding period. 

The universe of potential GP buyers, as well as the playbook for achieving growth, is likely to be 
different at each stage of an asset’s growth journey. For example, a lower-middle-market asset 
may be better placed to grow via a buy-and-build strategy than a large-cap asset. Thus, many  
PE GPs anticipating a sale to another sponsor typically frame the asset’s story in a way that is 
relevant to the growth playbook for an asset of a given size. 

IPO exits. This exit pathway requires GPs to demonstrate a consistent track record of organic 
growth for the asset. Additionally, given the greater coverage of an IPO, GPs would do well  
to have a clear and simple equity story. To this end, some GPs might make strategic decisions 
such as limiting expansion, focusing on a relatively short list of high-value priorities, or  
divesting business units within the asset. They may also begin upskilling the senior team and 
finance function so that the executives are fully equipped to meet the obligations of trading  
as a public company.

77

Braced for shifting weatherGPs also need to be flexible in how they plan their exit strategy. They should not make decisions 
that may preclude assets from unanticipated exit avenues that could provide greater value.

Exits are top of mind for many PE stakeholders, as the exit backlog has never been larger. While 
LPs increasingly care about distributions, exits are hard to get right, especially with today’s 
elevated marks. GPs that can master the exit playbook through all stages of the asset life cycle, 
and position the asset for exit from the beginning, stand to reap the highest rewards.

The next wave of private 
market innovation

Strategies for secondaries and GP stakes have become increasingly  
popular liquidity channels for both managers and investors. 

79

Braced for shifting weatherIn the private market industry, investors have historically allocated capital alongside GPs either 
through commingled funds or co-invest structures. Such allocation approaches have delivered 
healthy returns, surpassing public markets’ performance over the long term.1 However, the 
traditional commingled-fund approach has limitations. For one, investors may find it difficult to 
gain exposure to the trends that private market firms often capitalize on to generate economic 
gains (unless they are a part of, or own, a private capital manager or invest in a publicly listed 
manager). Second, private capital investments are almost always considered to be illiquid in 
nature: LPs allocate capital to a fund, then potentially wait five years or longer for distributions,  
with limited ability to obtain liquidity in the interim. It is also challenging for investors to remain 
allocated to an investment beyond the fund’s maturity limit.

To resolve these challenges, two investment strategies have emerged in recent years: 
secondaries and GP stakes. 

Both GPs and LPs have embraced secondaries as a liquidity channel at a time when many managers 
are sitting on a vast number of unsold assets due to a challenging exit environment. The second 
strategy—wherein GPs can sell a stake in their entity to other investors—can also help GPs source 
capital for strategic purposes. It also provides LPs with exposure to the long-term economics  
of the private market industry (for example, management fees, fund performance, and growing 
assets under management). Indeed, the performance of the GP stakes strategy, particularly  
in 2012–21 vintage funds, outmatched even that of private equity (PE) (historically the best-
performing private market asset class), with more limited variability on average.

While interest in the two strategies has been flourishing, they remain niche approaches within 
the private market universe. In our view, they both have significant potential for deployment as 
well as for sourcing additional capital.

Secondaries sustain upward momentum 
Liquidity has been top of mind for private market stakeholders over the past few years, given 
slowing exits and capital called by GPs exceeding distributions for most of this period, as we 
highlight in our Global Private Markets Report 2025.2

Secondaries allow investors to access older vintage investments across strategies and managers 
by typically purchasing at a discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the stake purchased. 

LPs can fulfill their liquidity requirements by selling their stakes in the funds on the secondary 
market before those funds have matured. Moreover, secondaries empower LPs to rebalance 
their portfolios. For example, LPs can invest in diversified sets of private capital funds without 
needing to allocate to each fund individually, which could expose them to a wider range of 
vintages. LPs can also adjust their allocations when an investment is not performing well or  
there is a change in their overall investment strategy. 

1   For example, the ten-year period between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2024, or the 25-year period 

between the fourth quarter of 1999 and the third quarter of 2024, as mentioned in the article: “Global Private Markets Report 
2025: Private equity emerging from the fog,” McKinsey, February 13, 2025.

Braced for shifting weatherThe secondaries market is beneficial for GPs too. It helps them retain control over a business that 
they may not be ready to exit (for example, because they believe they are best positioned to 
continue to drive value for that business). At the same time, it allows them to sell assets from their 
funds through a GP-led secondaries transaction. They can do so by setting up a continuation 
vehicle to hold an asset longer, especially if they believe there is significant value that can be 
created from the asset with an extended holding period. 

The growing appeal of the strategy is reflected in strong deal activity, fundraising, pricing, and 
performance data, as we analyze in the following sections. 

Deal activity
Total secondaries deal volume increased 45 percent year over year to $162 billion, making 2024 
the highest year on record.

The uptick in deal activity was driven by LP-led secondaries, which rose 45 percent to $87 billion3 
(Exhibit 1). Additionally, GP-led secondaries rose 44 percent to $75 billion. Nearly 84 percent of 
GP-led deals were continuation vehicles.

Braced for shifting weatherFundraising
In addition to using the secondaries market to exit investments, GPs have increased their 
fundraising efforts to buy more secondary stakes. Fundraising for secondaries totaled $65 billion, 
making 2024 the third-highest year on record (Exhibit 2). In comparison, total secondaries 
fundraising has averaged $71 billion annually over the past three years versus $52 billion on 
average over the past ten years.

Fundraising for secondaries remains concentrated—the top ten GPs have accounted for  
an average of 60 percent of aggregate fundraising over the past decade. Yet, we see a gradual 
increase in fundraising by managers outside the top ten; such managers raised around  
$32 billion on average in the past three years, which accounted for 45 percent of total secondaries 
capital raised during the period. This is significantly higher than the $21 billion they raised on 
average annually over the past decade.

Pricing
Secondary transactions typically trade at a discount to the NAV of the assets or the stake being 
sold to obtain liquidity faster. However, shopping for bargains is not all that matters. In the 
McKinsey LP survey, respondents ranked the discount to NAV, the track record and reputation of 
the GP, and the potential value creation in the remaining portfolio companies as the top three 
assessment criteria for potential secondaries investments.

Braced for shifting weatherSecondaries pricing as a percentage of NAV across all private market asset classes rose in  
2024 to 89 percent, up from 85 percent in 2023 (Exhibit 3).4 Buyout secondaries traded at  
the highest percentage of NAV at 94 percent. Private debt secondaries pricing rose the most, 
from 77 percent of NAV in 2023 to 91 percent of NAV in 2024. Meanwhile, real estate 
secondaries traded at the lowest percentage of NAV in 2024 at 72 percent, nearly in line with  
its trading value of 71 percent of NAV in 2022 and 2023. 

This general upward movement in pricing (reflected in the narrowing spread) will likely catalyze 
further transactions, as LPs recognize that they can exit positions in the secondaries market 
while keeping a greater share of book value.

While secondaries provide a liquidity alternative for GPs and LPs, they also function as an 
attractive risk-adjusted investment strategy. Secondaries funds are popular investments, partly 
because they provide diversification across vintages, strategies, and managers. And as the 
strategy matures, its performance is also improving. Returns of secondaries funds have been 
higher than those of PE on average over the past three vintages (Exhibit 4). 

It helps that secondaries funds offer a hedge to the industry: During bear years, the discount at 
which you can make secondaries trades rises, which drives up returns; during stronger years, the 
discount reduces, leading to fewer opportunities for multiple expansion.

Braced for shifting weatherWhen compared with other private capital asset classes, secondaries funds also posted the 
highest median return, while having the third-lowest return dispersion (Exhibit 5). Additionally, 
the median return for secondaries is more than five percentage points higher than for the two 
asset classes (private debt and infrastructure) that have lower return dispersions, indicating a 
strong relative risk/return profile for secondaries funds. 

Secondaries funds also offer a stronger liquidity profile than most other private capital funds. For 
vintages from 2000 through 2021, for example, net cash flow for the median secondaries fund 
turns positive in year eight, matched only by private debt. In comparison, median funds for other 
private capital asset classes do not reach positive net cash flow until year ten. 

GP stakes: A nascent but growing strategy 
GP stakes funds allow investors to access the business of private markets, as opposed to merely 
investing with private market firms. 

In fact, many LPs are increasingly looking to buy GPs through a GP stakes investment. Such 
investments typically involve acquiring minority equity stakes, but in rare cases, buyers can 
acquire controlling stakes in GPs as well.

Braced for shifting weatherBy selling stakes in their entity, a GP can secure capital for strategic uses, such as investing  
in infrastructure for scaling the business or building new products. The entity investing in GP 
stakes can also serve as a strategic partner that provides the staked firm with distinct 
perspectives and capabilities. In some cases, it can even assist with succession planning  
at the GP. 

For LPs, investing in GP stakes can open new investment opportunities, particularly given the 
significant tailwinds that are powering growth in the private capital industry (such as the 
continually increasing allocation targets of LPs, increased retail investor access to the industry, 
and proven long-term performance). In the McKinsey LP survey, 43 percent of the respondents 
said they invest in GP stakes funds, with more than half of this group expressing interest in directly 
investing in GPs. In particular, 70 percent of the sovereign wealth funds that participated in the 
survey expressed interest in directly acquiring stakes in a GP. 

LPs have cited many reasons for their increasing interest in this strategy. Investing in GP stakes 
could offer an attractive risk/return profile, with the downside risk limited by the resilient nature 
of GPs (see section on GP stakes performance). LPs also express confidence in the overall 
organic growth of private markets and want to capture this growth via direct exposure to GP 
economics. And, last but not least, they see a proven track record from existing GP stakes funds. 
This interest is manifested in the strategy’s robust fundraising volumes in 2024, driven largely  
by its consistent performance over the years.

For LPs, investing in GP stakes can 
open new investment opportunities, 
particularly given the significant 
tailwinds that are powering growth 
in the private capital industry.

86

Braced for shifting weatherFundraising
GP stakes remain a nascent part of overall private market fundraising. In 2024, fundraising for 
the strategy reached $4.4 billion, a significant increase compared with the prior year’s  
$600 million raised but well below the $31 billion raised in 2022 (Exhibit 6). Notably, the vast 
majority of 2022’s fundraising total had come from three flagship GP stakes funds.

At the same time, the number of GP stakes funds being raised reached its highest number ever in 
2024, with 11 fund closings. As with secondaries, the market for GP stakes funds is still shallow, 
and fundraising is dependent on the timing of the largest fundraisers. But the pace of fundraising 
has accelerated. In the past three years, for example, an average of $12 billion per year was 
raised across an average of nearly seven funds annually. In comparison, $6.7 billion across an 
average of 4.6 funds per year was raised over the prior five-year period. 

Performance
The performance of GP stakes funds—in terms of both absolute returns and the relatively low 
level of dispersion between funds—is a key factor driving the growing interest.5 For the  
2012–21 vintage funds, the median performance of GP stakes funds is consistent with buyouts 
(historically, the highest-returning PE strategy). But the difference between the top and  
bottom quartiles is far more modest (IRR of 7.9 for GP stakes funds, compared with 13.1 for 
buyout funds) (Exhibit 7).

Investing in secondaries and GP stakes presents new opportunities for LPs and GPs to engage in 
dynamic portfolio construction, while also expanding their private market exposure. To do this well, 
these investors may need to build new capabilities. For example, they would need to engage in 
effective due diligence of the manager, including appropriate valuation, and estimate the long-term 
strategic positioning of managers. GPs would need to build a data strategy to rapidly benchmark 
manager performance, measure attribution and repeatability of performance-driving mechanisms, 
and create sourcing strategies to identify and approach emerging GPs. Additionally, many GPs 
may need to embrace the idea of partnership with other managers through GP stakes transactions 
to gain knowledge and capabilities from new investment partners.
