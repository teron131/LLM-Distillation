Introduction

Today’s uncertainty and disruption of business and society is challenging leaders in unforeseen ways.

The liquidity scare in banking and accompanying interest rate sensitivity is just the latest in a series of concerning 
developments. A range of disruptions, including geopolitical conflicts and inflation in the short term and shifts in customer 
behavior and supply chain structures in the long term, have upended the concept of risk and resilience. We are living  
and working in a world of risks come to fruition. Ever-present crises and continuous external shifts are the new normal. 

It is amid this environment that with this, our 14th edition, we are changing the title of our cornerstone publication to 
McKinsey on Risk & Resilience. 

This change is more of an acknowledgment than a shift. Even before the past year, our work, research, and analysis 
on these pages had come to reflect the reality that many threats have come to life. “Risk,” as defined by financial 
institutions, has not changed, and we understand that the management of existing and potential threats is only part of 
the function. Positioning and growth amid this environment is equally essential in an effort to build resilience.

This issue explores four key themes: resilience for sustainable and inclusive growth, addressing climate risk and 
sustainability, managing risk in uncertainty, and the evolution of risk organizations.

Now more than ever, resilience is center stage. And its necessity stretches beyond any single organization or entity. Our 
socioeconomic systems have become deeply interconnected in ways that are not always apparent until crisis strikes. In 
other words, resilience—the ability to survive and thrive amid continuous tumult—is at a premium. 

This does not mean becoming risk-averse and playing defense. Leaders must identify the opportunities from 
disruptions and changes and play offense, thus balancing opportunities and risks toward resilient growth paths that 
satisfy the appetites of investors, markets, and stakeholders in their organizations while fending off rivals. This implies 
shifting management capacity from detailed planning exercises to more dynamic resource allocation, better foresight, 
and quicker adaptation capabilities in areas where the environment has changed. 

In this issue, we start by offering our most recent views on resilience as developed and extensively discussed by the 
Resilience Consortium forums in Davos, where we collaborated with the World Economic Forum, among others, to 
develop six strategic resilience themes that are dominating boardroom discussions.

Our attention then turns to Ukraine, and businesses share lessons from the first year of operating amid war. 

We then provide our latest views on climate risk and share research, insights, and best practices to help banks manage 
financed emissions in the net-zero transition.

We take a deep dive into financial and nonfinancial risks, affecting both corporates and banks, including technology, 
interest rates, operational risk events, and credit risk management.

Finally, we identify organizations succeeding in today’s environment and the keys to their success. The squeeze on 
resources for chief risk officers also is addressed, and we examine what is needed and what is not when it comes to 
building a team and management system that is strong and nimble and meets the moment.

As always, we hope you find these articles useful, informative, and actionable. We encourage you to dive deeper into 
McKinsey.com and reach out to let us know what you think at McKinsey_Risk@McKinsey.com.

Leaders of public- and private-sector 
organizations have lately faced a lifetime’s worth 
of disruption and crises. They have had to steer 
through global conflict, energy uncertainty, food 
shortages, supply interruptions, high inflation, 
market volatility, and severe climate events in a 
world still emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Unavoidably comes a recognition that the current 
and future operating environment is one of 
continuous natural and man-made disruptions. The 
reality has serious implications; understanding it 
comes with commensurate responsibilities. 

The disruptions cannot be treated in isolation, 
one after another, as they arise and reverberate 
through our fragile ecosystems and stressed 
networks. There aren’t enough resources in the 
world to do that. Many now agree that resilience 
is our key challenge: we must strengthen our 
resilience beyond a survival capacity to enable 
long-term, sustainable, and inclusive growth. The 
time has come now to act on this understanding.

Enter the “resilience agenda.” This complex effort 
has been developed by the Resilience Consortium—
government ministers, chief executives, and heads 
of international organizations—working with 
ongoing World Economic Forum (WEF) initiatives. 
The resilience agenda is designed to accelerate 
collective action across key resilience themes. It 
is the first serious program to coordinate long-
term solutions throughout the broad fabric of our 
disrupted world.

The resilience agenda was presented in depth at 
the 2023 annual meeting of the WEF in Davos, 
Switzerland.1 Discussions focused on cultivating 
leadership thinking and motivating real progress 
on the resilience objectives. Three key concepts 
were stressed:

themes, the integrated resilience agenda is an 
urgent necessity for our times. The disruptions 
revealed hidden connections among the 
themes—supply chain vulnerabilities emerged, 
energy security came into focus, and the 
contours of what must be an affordable energy 
transition became clearer. Intersectoral links can 
seemingly be adduced ad infinitum. Technology, 
for example, can become a growth engine for 
business and society, as it provides new answers 
for energy needs and healthcare provision.  

2.  The long-term perspective is imperative. 

Governments and companies naturally focus 
on finding solutions to immediate problems. 
Of equal—even paramount—importance for 
organizations and societies, however, is a long-
term focus on strategic objectives. The need 
for the long view is glaring in terms of climate 
risk; it also extends to the global supply chain, 
the geopolitical environment, technological 
innovation, people and education, and healthcare. 
Within and across these themes, long-term risks 
emerge—demographic trends, data privacy issues, 
and stubborn inequities in every socioeconomic 
dimension large and small. All must be accounted 
for in strategic planning for sustainable growth. 

3.  Progress will come only through public–private 
collaboration and international cooperation. 
Individual governments and companies cannot 
by themselves resolve the world’s problems 
or open exclusive paths to sustained growth. 
In defining long-term growth parameters, the 
private and public sectors have never needed 
each other more than they do right now. 
Disruptions do not respect borders; successful 
economic development will come only with 
international cooperation and engagement. 

1.  The resilience agenda is a complex, continuous 

effort that will extend through years and 
decades. Given the level of disruption we are 
experiencing and the interconnectedness of the 

The six resilience themes
The resilience agenda addresses six themes, which 
become the deeply interconnected areas of action 
(Exhibit 1).

1  The full white paper presenting the resilience agenda, “Seizing the momentum to build resilience for a future of sustainable inclusive growth,” 

was created by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with McKinsey. With a foreword by Børge Brende, president of the World Economic 
Forum, and Bob Sternfels, McKinsey’s global managing partner, the paper is available on McKinsey.com and WEF.org.

McKinsey & Company

The linkages and the vulnerabilities within and 
across the themes must be explored so that 
actions in one area can be aligned with the goals 
in the others and even accelerate progress toward 
them. The actions within the themes are broadly 
described below.

Geopolitical resilience
Multinational institutions need to adapt business 
strategies and reconfigure business models if they 
are to act flexibly in different geopolitical spheres. 
Policy makers and business leaders should 
deepen their grasp of economic and geopolitical 
interdependencies, collaborating with one another 
to enhance planning for a wide range of scenarios. 
Institutions active in sensitive regions should 
center business plans around a coherent set of 
values and a global ethos. Leaders need to know 
what they are for and what they are against so they 
can confidently engage (or disengage).

Policy makers can set incentives to encourage 
private-sector investment in R&D, manufacturing, 
and distribution. Industry dynamics and 
country-level competitiveness can be 

improved by optimizing company policies and 
standards on sensitive business areas such 
as trade, intellectual property, R&D, data, and 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
aims. Organizations can craft detailed, analytical 
scenarios that clarify concrete future actions, 
especially for highly probable, high-impact 
threats. An agenda of actions for each threat, 
an essential step, should be compiled based 
on a thorough understanding of geopolitical 
developments. Public–private sector cooperation 
in such scenario planning is necessary, since 
interests are highly interdependent.

Climate, energy, and food resilience
Today’s energy uncertainty is exacerbating the 
effects of a long-term decline in energy investment. 
This averaged 7.7 percent per year between 2010 
and 2014, and disinvestment has been measured 
ever since (–2.4 percent annually for the 2014– 
22 period). Coupled with insufficiently diversified 
supply chains, as well as scarcity of the labor and 
raw materials essential for the energy transition, 
static investment is putting the availability and 
security of energy at risk.

The resilience agenda for sustainable, inclusive growth

7

Organizations should define supply 
chain dependencies and reduce  
geopolitical, technological, and single- 
sourcing vulnerabilities.

The green-energy transition must include energy 
security and affordability among its primary 
objectives. A sustainable path will require 
“both/and” approaches, including efficiency 
improvements, transitional solutions (such as 
blue hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, 
and storage), as well as clean electrification with 
renewables. The resilience agenda specifies 
actions to achieve decarbonization, energy 
diversification, grid electrification, and R&D in the 
scarce materials on which the transition depends. 
It also highlights the business opportunities in the 
net-zero transition, citing research suggesting 
trillions in untapped value.  

Food, water, energy, and climate change are 
fundamentally interlinked challenges. Failure to 
solve the resilience equation will risk climate events 
of great magnitude and physical damage. Recent 
and ongoing events constrain food availability 
and push up prices. Food system resilience, 
together with nutrition security, are necessary for 
populations to live healthily. Diverse stakeholders 
will have to work together for a green-farming 
transition to make healthier food more plentiful. 
Energy availability and decarbonization are needed 
to contain climate change and enable all countries 
to produce food sustainably. Together, the public 
and private sectors must think through these 
interconnected issues and ensure that efforts are 
aligned to create food and water security along 
with energy availability.

Trade and supply chain resilience 
Organizations should define supply chain 
dependencies and reduce geopolitical, 
technological, and single-sourcing vulnerabilities. 
At the same time, resilience efforts must not 
sacrifice long-held supplier relationships and the 
global interconnections that enable prosperity. 
To build resilient supply chains, leaders should 
emphasize themes in three areas:

1.     Spot over-the-horizon risks using “early 
sensing” and scenario planning. Unlike 
attempts at prediction, this approach seeks 
to assess a range of potential outcomes given 
active forces and trends, then connects the 
outcomes to trigger-based escalation and 
action protocols.

2.    Reconfigure sourcing footprints, making 

moves measured against the value of retaining 
existing sources of supply. Vertical integration, 
where appropriate, can also be considered. 
The potential benefits of adding new sourcing 
locations should be weighed against the 
challenges inherent in unwinding long-held 
supplier relationships. In anticipation of potential 
supply disruptions, such as input shortages, 
companies can deploy multisourcing strategies.

3.    Build capabilities in the supply chain 

organization, practicing disruptive scenarios 
and rehearsing lessons from past mistakes and 

8

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023near misses. Acquire requisite new technology 
and data while building capabilities for demand 
sensing and dynamic forecasting, including 
upskilled in-house talent deployed to supply 
chain digital teams. Regarding international 
collaboration and competition, governments 
should clarify a clear rules-based framework to 
remove uncertainty and improve conditions for 
long-term investments and resilient growth.

People, educational, and organizational resilience 
Organizations need flexible operating models 
and adaptable leadership. Leaders should 
cultivate talent so that decision making can be 
decentralized and is supported by self-sufficient 
teams with on-the-spot knowledge. At the 
same time, tomorrow’s economy will need new 
skills. Societies and organizations must invest in 
education, especially early education. Leaders 
must close growing skill gaps and reduce social 
inequalities while upskilling and reskilling the 
existing workforce.

The supply gap in talent is even wider in low- and 
middle-income countries, where the pandemic 
depressed education. Poverty in education means 
a loss of potential income for individuals and an 
acute talent shortage at the national or regional 
level. To overcome these challenges, organizations 
must invest in organizational resilience, matching 
talent to strategy. That is a proven means to create 
value. Resilient organizations absorb shocks and 
turn them into opportunities, “bouncing forward” 
during crisis times. To build resilience in talent, 
leadership, and education, organizations need 
to act on a number of themes: organizational 
flexibility, adaptable leadership, diversity and 
inclusion, continuous talent and capability building, 
and a transformative approach to learning that 
addresses strategic skills.

Healthcare resilience 
A multifaceted approach is needed to meet rising 
healthcare demand and alleviate healthcare supply  
constraints while enhancing emergency preparedness.  
The overarching goal is to ensure equitable access 
to care for all. Reducing health inequities across 
social groups strengthens healthcare systems and 
contributes significantly to economic growth. 

Research indicates that by investing in preventative 
and chronic care, healthcare systems can reduce 
the global disease burden by 25 percent. The 
preventative approach promotes longer high-quality 
life—an 18-year gap in average life expectancy 
separates populations in low- and high-income 
countries. Investment areas include environmental 
sustainability, health education, availability of 
healthier food and clean water, and access to 
vaccines and preventive treatments generally.

Societies need to increase the capacity and 
productivity of the healthcare system and expand 
the workforce. These improvements will come at a 
cost, but the burden can be reduced with digitization 
and other innovations by up to 15 percent. Effective 
actions are needed to support and retain the current 
workforce while hiring, training, and developing 
new talent. More women doctors, nurses, and other 
caregivers are sorely needed, in an environment that 
provides equal pay for equal work.

Digital and technological resilience
Digitization and technology will be key drivers 
of long-term productivity gains. They will add 
agility and speed to organizations. As with all 
innovation, these efforts will be highly iterative 
and fast changing. It is nonetheless important 
that leaders develop a long-term perspective 
on the growth impact of the changes, identify 
seed opportunities, and develop a portfolio 
approach to growth. Technology will be a 
key driver of change in all resilience areas—
especially in the energy transition, education, 
healthcare, and supply chains. Disruption and 
risk resulting from technological transitions must 
be carefully managed. Action areas here will 
include cybersecurity—since threats continue 
to proliferate—and societal advocacy. Societal 
objectives include ethical parameters protecting 
personal privacy, as well as the promotion of 
inclusivity and the eradication of the digital divide. 
The International Labour Organization estimates 
that achieving universal broadband coverage 
means connecting three billion people who have 
never used the internet. Doing this alone could 
create 24 million new jobs worldwide, including 
millions of jobs for young people.

The resilience agenda for sustainable, inclusive growth

9

We must realize the underdeveloped  
potential of public–private  
collaboration to foster resilience.

Technology will be one of the biggest economic-
development factors, and it can be affected 
significantly by geopolitical trends. Policy makers 
should provide guidance to the private sector 
on acceptable dependencies versus those that 
should be reduced. The impact of digital innovation 
on society, meanwhile, can be challenging or 
even unwanted. Strategies to train workers on 
developing higher skills and to provide alternative 
careers are needed to prevent sections of the 
workforce from becoming disadvantaged and 
suffering a loss in living standards.

Four resilience enablers
The actions within the themes of the resilience 
agenda are made possible by a group of 
essential enablers:

 — Leadership and capabilities. A new leadership 

culture is needed to steer the resilience agenda. 
Resilience leaders can lean into uncertainty, 
extending foresight capabilities. They can also 
act deliberately to secure long-term solutions 
while managing the short-term issues. They 
can reshape their organizations for speed and 
agility by decentralizing decision making to self-
sufficient teams. 

 — Finance. Funding resilience will require one 
of the largest capital allocations in history. 
Public institutions alone do not have sufficient 
resources; private capital is needed, and returns 
on those investments will have to be addressed. 

Enhancements of financial and fiscal capacity 
for resilience will be achieved through better 
incentive structures, longer-term capacity 
planning, and the leveraging of capital and 
insurance markets.  

 — Sustainable economic development. Actions 
here will include improving the availability and 
affordability of housing, healthcare, and energy 
through scalable interventions; investing in 
youth education, the youth workforce, and an 
inclusive future economy; making balanced 
investments in technology to enhance 
productivity; supporting small business; and 
improving the investment environment. 

 — Public- and private-sector collaboration. We 
must realize the underdeveloped potential of 
public–private collaboration to foster resilience. 
This should be done through both small-scale 
projects of local importance and large projects 
with national vision. Strong project pipelines 
should be developed, with projects prioritized 
according to impact. Implementation must be 
highly efficient with optimal allocation of risks.

The value at stake
The value at stake in the resilience agenda for long-
term growth is enormous. Leading research shows 
that action or inaction within these resilience 
themes could have short- and long-term impact 
on GDP ranging from –8 percent to +15 percent 
(Exhibit 2).

Business building:  
The path to resilience 
in uncertain times

In an uncertain economy, executives’ first instinct might be to  
cut costs and shore up established holdings. A better way is to build 
new businesses.

by Matt Banholzer, Ralf Dreischmeier, Laura LaBerge, and Ari Libarikian

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023In stable times, business building is a powerful 
way to extend into new and higher growth areas. In 
times of great disruption and uncertainty, however, 
building new businesses becomes a critical path  
to improving an organization’s ability to survive  
and thrive.

50%

of all revenue during the next five years is  
expected to come from new businesses, 
products, and services.

Many leaders are bracing for a rough economic 
ride—they’re girding their companies against 
a series of acute global risks. In addition to 
geopolitical instability, volatile commodity 
markets, and rising inflation, they anticipate 
continued waves of global health crises, more 
frequent and severe climate hazards, and major 
shifts in consumer and industrial demand. 
These developments, they feel, could put long-
term pressure on their business models—thus 
heightening the need for resilience.1

The new reality is that crisis and disruption are 
here to stay, and conventional approaches won’t 
work the way they did in the past. Business 
building, by contrast, is a way to diversify, shore  
up, protect, and expand when others are 
contracting. Committing resources to a new 
business, however, is only part of a winning 
strategy. Incumbents need a tool kit: a road map, a 
sense of urgency, and an entrepreneurial mindset, 
using their advantages—resources and talent—
and eliminating disadvantages, such as barriers 
to innovation and systems that don’t support new 
initiatives and growth.

Traditionally, resilience meant cutting costs and 
preserving capital. While belt-tightening shouldn’t 
be ignored, the cost focus alone has never been 
sufficient—and it certainly isn’t in today’s market. 
Business is not facing just a momentary inflection 

but also a state of volatility and long-term change 
that is becoming the new normal. In an extended 
volatile environment, companies must create 
optionality to enhance their risk profiles—not only 
their exposure to markets or geographies but also 
their exposure to system-level changes (Exhibit 1).

New businesses can be the best way for 
incumbents to grow now and in future evolutions 
of the world’s current era of volatility. Established 
companies have many advantages in building 
new businesses: infrastructure, talent, facilities, 
and brand. Incumbents may, of course, face 
challenges with innovations, processes, and 
cultures that don’t lend themselves to internal 
entrepreneurship—but these are all execution-
driven challenges, and none are insurmountable.

Companies can diversify in a few ways, but building 
new businesses constitutes an especially powerful 
approach. For example, our research suggests 
business building helped companies weather 
pandemic disruptions: 34 percent of companies 
that prioritized business building kept their 
revenues from shrinking during the pandemic, 
compared with 26 percent of companies that

prioritized other organic-growth strategies.2 
Business building provides both financial as well 
as operational diversification that is broader than 
typical cost-saving measures (Exhibit 2).

At a basic level, newly built businesses help 
established companies form new customer 
relationships and accelerate growth. Organic 
growth typically generates more value, and it 
spares companies from paying a takeover premium 
on top of the stand-alone value of the acquired 
business.3 Because new businesses don’t have 
legacy costs, they can yield higher profit margins 
and be less exposed to cash flow pressures. 

And when new businesses have offerings and 
operating models that differ substantially from 
those of existing holdings, they help insulate 
an organization against inflation, supply chain 
disruption, and economic down cycles. Achieving 
these benefits involves focusing on businesses 
that foster resilience and growth.

New businesses that build resilience
Considering the challenges facing companies today, 
four types of new-business builds are particularly 
well suited to resilience. Many of these can be 
started rapidly and begin generating earnings

within 24 months—enabling success in early stages 
and beyond.

The countercyclical businesses
Catering to markets or customers with relatively 
inelastic (and growing) demand allows established 
companies to better counter cyclical swings. 
For example, data sales related to transaction 
processing are less directly correlated to consumer 
spend than swipe fees, which tend to go up and 
down with the economy and consumer confidence.

There are several approaches to building ventures 
that help organizations diversify away from 
exposure to inflation. For example, some service 

businesses generate more stable revenues than 
comparable product or capital goods businesses, 
because they can supplement their sales of larger-
ticket items such as elevators or automobiles 
with services that are smaller but longer touch. 
In such cases, companies can shift their sales 
model to accommodate cash-strapped customers 
and move from a “sell the air compressor” model 
to a “sell the tire refill” model. At times, even 
more straightforward approaches to inflation 
mitigation (for example, cost pass-throughs) are 
more palatable to customers if accompanied with 
updated business models (for example, where sales 
are linked to outcomes). In consumer products,  
for example, the notion of the “Lipstick Index”4

was coined to describe how certain, more 
accessible products (small “affordable luxuries”) 
can become popular during times of economic 
difficulty when larger purchases need to be put 
on hold. Finding these pockets of growth within 
whatever business you’re in (and even scaling to 
new businesses through novel delivery platforms, 
for instance) can be critical to survival and future 
growth but won’t happen if an organization is 
narrowly focused on cost.

Resource-light businesses
When interest rates rise and cash flow dwindles, 
new ventures that can scale without proportional 
additions of equipment or workers can reinforce 
the bottom line of a company whose other divisions 
require substantial capital assets and head count. 
These commonly take the form of marketplace 
convenors. Uber and Airbnb, for example, 
famously created e-commerce versions of these 
models. More recent examples are companies 
that have provided platforms for services that 
others provide, such as Verbling, which connects 
language tutors to students, and Bosch-owned 
Azena, which created an Internet of Things 
ecosystem for security devices. Companies such 
as these, with existing relationships and access to 
users or providers, are in a privileged position to 
scale these businesses rapidly with little capital of 
their own at risk.

Similarly, we are seeing new businesses built by 
“asset owners” take on more business functions 
that used to be done later in the value chain. 
Residential real-estate companies such as RXR 
built businesses during the 2008–09 financial 
crisis that enabled them to offer new end-to-end 
customer experiences—for example, move-in 
assistance or digital concierges for housekeeping 
or grocery delivery. This isn’t limited to residential 
real estate: commercial warehouse providers now 
offer logistical services beyond the four walls, 
workforce training, and more. If your organization 

might not be the best owner of the asset or function, 
it can still be the best connector of whatever the 
asset is to whomever needs to use it, depending on 
your business context.

Consolidated or robust supply-chain-driven 
businesses
A McKinsey survey in 2020 found that industries 
experienced supply chain disruptions lasting for 
a month or longer every 3.7 years. And this was 
before COVID-19 lockdowns, trade tensions, war in 
Ukraine, disruptive weather, and other difficulties 
snarled global supply chains. This year brought 
sharp increases in prices of commodities such as 
fertilizer, aluminum, coal, and steel. While supply 
chains and commodities tend to correct in the long 
term, midterm disruptions abound and highlight 
the comparative resilience of businesses that 
operate with light exposure to global logistics and 
overseas production.

These patterns are generating a lot of interest in 
circular business models,5 which reclaim the initial 
product for its raw materials to be used in future 
production. Such models are meeting new needs 
from a supply chain perspective but also from an 
environmental standpoint. One example that is 
being highlighted as a success is EMMA Safety 
Footwear.6 The company created the first safety 
shoe that had a fully circular business model back 
in 2017 but couldn’t scale it enough to be profitable. 
It then engaged with industry competitors to 
create a bigger ecosystem that has the scale to 
be fully profitable and significantly less vulnerable 
to shocks that affect access to raw materials and 
overseas supply chain disruptions.

Similarly, successful businesses have been  
built based on providing insights that reduce  
input costs by increasing yield. Such businesses 
have thrived in disparate sectors such as 
semiconductor manufacturing (by increasing chip 
yields) and agricultural production (by increasing

fertilizer or pesticides).

Adjacent businesses facing less (or at least 
different) headwinds
Often, value pools adjacent to a company’s core 
can be unequally affected by headwinds. The 
adjacencies—commonly value-chain or market-
segment adjacencies—can be value areas to 
enter, as some incumbent advantages may be 
transferrable. Our research suggests companies 
that master moving into adjacencies can deliver 
3 percent more TSR over time.

News Corporation was a traditional print-media 
conglomerate that found itself needing to radically 
pivot in order to survive. Digital-heavy investment 
has transformed News Corporation into a market 
leader in the online real-estate, streaming, and 
information aggregation sectors. It didn’t just move 
its news from print to online (though it did that 
as well). It executed M&A-led entries into digital 
brands such as REA in Australia and Move in the 
United States and built out adjacent services 
such as mortgage brokering through the same 

platforms. It also purchased complementary 
data businesses that could plug into existing 
services and aggregated intellectual property 
from thousands of news information sources, in 
different formats and languages.

This play can win across sectors. Many consumer-
packaged-goods companies quickly adapted 
their channel mix, launched direct-to-consumer 
(D2C) offerings, tailored products for comfort and 
at-home use, and de-emphasized items like suits or 
corporate-office furniture and equipment. Materials 
companies moved downstream, often using D2C 
or white-label brands where their inputs could 
capture more value. And financial institutions, which 
commonly catered to business-to-business or other 
institutional investors, successfully entered retail 
banking (Exhibit 3).

scale enterprises. In the current environment, 
more companies could benefit from the resilience 
new businesses can provide. But building new 
businesses is not without risk. Just 20 percent of 
incumbent companies created 66 percent of the 
viable, large-scale businesses that have been built 
in the past ten years.7 While today’s heightened 
uncertainty could make the prospect of building 
new businesses less attractive to executives 
occupied with the health of existing businesses, the 
risk of not broadening the business portfolio could 
be even greater. Corporate longevity has never 
been lower, and more than 50 percent of all revenue 
over the next five years is expected to come from 
businesses and offerings not in existence today.

Research suggests that the risks of building new 
businesses can be mitigated and that incumbents 
possess certain advantages over start-ups.8 Take a 
look at what established companies can do to boost 
their new businesses’ odds of success.

Follow a proven playbook. Applying a rigorous 
business-building methodology can raise the 
success rate of new businesses and avoid common 
critical pitfalls.9

Make business building a habit. Our 2020 survey 
found that frequent business builders—those 
that launched four or more businesses in the past 
ten years—see higher returns on investment, 
on average, than those building fewer new 
businesses. These frequent business builders 
are 2.2 times more likely than other companies to 
generate returns of five or more times their original 
investment. The difference can be attributed, in 
part, to the benefits of having a portfolio of new 
companies and developing capabilities to build and 
scale these ventures.10

Start today. Our research suggests those that 
innovated and built new businesses in the last 
downturn outperformed by 10 percent in the 
crisis and 30 percent through the cycle. Market 
discontinuities can create opportunities—the time 
to start is now.

Business building is not without risk, but not taking 
the leap may be even riskier.

As the field of risk management evolves, the value proposition  
for employees has to evolve as well.

It’s not just a figment of our collective anxiety: 
our complex and interconnected world really has 
become more volatile. The past few years have 
brought a succession of public health, economic, 
environmental, and geopolitical shocks. They’ve 
also shown that the price of inadequate risk 
management can be high. As episodes from 
the 2008 financial crisis to this fall’s meltdown 
in cryptocurrency platforms have shown, the 
consequences can quickly cascade in finance. The 
same is true in other sectors as well. Supply chain1 
breakdowns have caused factory shutdowns and 
shortages of essential goods worldwide, while 
product safety failures have caused real harm 
and major legal liabilities. But risk isn’t only about 
extraordinary events; day-to-day operational 
failures can also lead to losses, regulatory action, 
and drops in share price. 

Companies need to anticipate and avoid or manage 
a wider range of disruptions than ever before—and 
that’s where risk and compliance professionals 
come in. They are charged with keeping their employers  
resilient2 by protecting their finances, operations, 
technology infrastructure, organizational strength,  
reputations, and business models. Think of the 
credit risk analyst who flags shaky loan applications, 
the product safety engineer who certifies that 
standards are met, the healthcare compliance 
officer who protects patient data, the risk manager 
who warns about a reputational issue with a 
potential vendor, and the business continuity 
planner who swings into action when a typhoon  
hits a key supplier.

for candidates who perfectly match a checklist of 
required skills and experience. Recent research5  
from MGI and McKinsey’s People and Organizational  
Performance Practice analyzed four million 
de-identified online work histories through 2019, 
across four major economies. Zooming in on the 
17,000 risk and compliance professionals in the 
data set shows that companies are already hiring 
people into these roles from an extraordinarily 
wide range of backgrounds. Here, we look at which 
industries and occupations they’re coming from and 
whether they’re staying to build careers in risk.

The talent scarcity that has spurred companies to hire 
from a broader pool may be due to risk and compliance 
being relatively new as a formal profession (see 
sidebar, “A brief history of risk management”). It may 
also be due to retention challenges. Only 13 percent 
of the people in our data set who started in a risk and 
compliance role remained in the field through the end 
of the period we observed.

Not all of this inflow and outflow is negative. There 
is value for companies and workers alike in having 
people rotate through risk. But an overreliance 
on individuals who are new to the field could 
become a vulnerability in and of itself. Employers 
and the profession as a whole can benefit from a 
greater emphasis on developing and retaining risk 
professionals with deeper expertise. As the field 
evolves, the value proposition for employees has 
to evolve as well. This is an opportune moment for 
companies to bring more of this function out of 
“back-room silos” and into the heart of the business.

As risk management has become a bigger 
imperative, companies have been scrambling to 
fill these critical roles.3 Previous MGI research4 
projected that risk-related jobs will grow twice as 
fast as all occupations in the United States. In 2021, 
the US unemployment rate for compliance officers 
was less than half the national unemployment rate, 
the sign of a tight market.

In most cases where demand for talent outstrips 
supply, the advice would be to stop holding out 

Companies are already casting 
wide nets to fill the growing 
need for risk-related roles 
The people in our data set who were risk 
professionals at the end of their observed work 
histories took two types of routes to get there. 
Some started out in the field and stayed in their 
professional lanes, building specialized expertise 
over time. But they were the minority; a far larger 
group transitioned into risk.

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023Sidebar

A brief history of risk management

Roles dedicated to preventing and 
mitigating risk may be a wholly modern 
business phenomenon, but the basic 
principles have been practiced for 
centuries. In medieval times, seafaring 
nations distributed cargo onto different 
ships as a hedge against storms and 
pirates, while fire societies were formed 
to secure goods from burning houses. 
During the Enlightenment Era, advances in 
probability theories transformed insurance 
from speculation to mass products backed 
by hard math. 

Recognizably modern professional 
approaches to risk management gained 
wider traction after World War II. As part of 
the rebuilding effort, engineers developed 
models to help identify potential issues 
prior to embarking on large projects. 
They also explored a new methodology 
of evaluating risk by considering the 
feasible detrimental outcome measured by 
likelihood of occurrence and magnitude of 
potential consequence. Around the same 
time, factory workers sought coverage for 
work-related illnesses and accidents. In 
the 1970s, financial institutions explored 
the use of derivatives to manage risk. Chief 
risk officer positions started to emerge 
with the mandate to manage market and 
credit risk.

The 21st century has brought in a new 
wave of regulations worldwide. Not 
only has this increased the compliance 
burden for individual institutions, it 
has also formalized expectations that 
industries need to manage risk overall. 
Pharmaceutical companies, for example, 
must consider risk when allocating 
significant capital to develop new drugs 
that must clear multiple scientific and 
regulatory approval hurdles before they 
can be brought to market; they also face 
compliance, supply chain, and quality risks. 
In 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the 
United States outlined financial record-
keeping rules, and stock exchanges added 
risk management governance rules for 
listed companies. Other countries enacted 
their own rules for audit, accounting, and 
internal controls. 

Just as catastrophes in the past, such as 
fires and earthquakes, propelled safety 
standards and insurance markets, more 
recent crises have similarly provoked 
regulatory responses, compliance 
demands, and advances in risk 
management. The 2008 global financial 
crisis sent shock waves around the 
world and ushered in strong risk-related 
regulation, notably the 2010 Basel III 
Accord, which increased supervision 

and capital reserve standards for the 
financial sector. 

Major data breaches and hacking 
incidents have led companies to beef up 
their cybersecurity defenses and teams. In 
2018, the European Union implemented 
extensive GDPR regulations requiring 
businesses to protect personal data 
and creating new compliance demands. 
The rise of fintech firms has created the 
need for updated financial regulation 
and compliance standards. Meanwhile, 
with climate disasters occurring more 
frequently and the associated losses 
climbing ever higher, climate risk 
management has moved from the purview 
of development agencies and into the 
private sector. The COVID-19 pandemic 
caused unprecedented disruptions to 
healthcare systems, global supply chains, 
and more, placing resilience at the top of 
corporate and policy agendas. 
More than ever, companies need a robust 
understanding of their exposure to 
different types of shocks, vulnerabilities, 
and potential losses to bolster their 
strategic resilience. 

A whopping 90 percent of the risk and compliance 
professionals in our data set did not start in  
risk roles (Exhibit 1).6 This is double the share of  
tech professionals7 who broke into their field from 
nontech occupations—a striking comparison, since 
tech is similarly a relatively new and fast-moving 

field where demand is projected to remain strong 
well into the future. As a discipline, risk is heavily 
reliant on bringing in fresh talent to fill roles. Indeed, 
there is often value in bringing someone into risk 
who has well-rounded business experience.

6  Our analysis focused on the following occupational categories: managers, all other (which includes regulatory affairs managers, compliance 
managers, and loss prevention managers); compliance officers; business operations specialists, all other (which includes business continuity 
planners and sustainability specialists); financial examiners; financial specialists, all other (which includes financial quantitative analysts, fraud 
examiners, investigators, and analysts); and credit authorizers, checkers, and clerks.

Addressing the revolving door in risk

21

Individuals with non-risk-related backgrounds 
master new skills when they enter the field. We refer 
to the jump in skills associated with a role move as 
the “skill distance” associated with that move; this 
metric reflects the fraction of skill requirements for 
a new role that were not part of the job someone 
previously held. The workers who were new to risk 
and compliance moved an average skill distance 
of some 40 percent. This is slightly higher than the 
35 percent average across all occupations, but it 
is hardly insurmountable. Furthermore, this skill 
distance is roughly the same whether or not workers 
trying to break into risk and compliance change 
industries. Employers that take a skills-based view 
when evaluating candidates have the option to draw 
on talent across industries rather than just looking 
close to home.

Shifting into risk management from a nonrisk 
occupation also requires people to make more job 

moves through the course of their career—between 
10 and 15 percent more, on average—than those 
who stay in the same risk occupation. Perhaps 
surprisingly, however, people who started in 
different risk-related occupations moved about  
10 percent more frequently than those who started 
in nonrisk occupations. This holds whether or not 
they changed industries, perhaps reflecting the 
fact that specific types of risk functions are often 
siloed within companies—and that when committed 
risk professionals want to branch out and develop 
new capabilities, they sometimes have to change 
employers to do so.  

Not only do most risk and compliance professionals 
shift roles, but nearly half of them switch industries 
over the course of their careers. As Exhibit 1 shows, 
those risk professionals who change industries 
undertake more role moves on average than those 
who remain within the same industry.

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023Overall, 70 percent of the risk and compliance talent 
moving across industries came from industrials, 
consumer discretionary products, finance, and 
technology (Exhibit 2). But companies in certain 
sectors are more likely to hire people who already 
“speak the industry language.” Sixty percent of risk 
professionals in finance and 57 percent of those in 
healthcare started within the same industry. In both 
of these industries, regulations tend to be extensive, 
reflecting the consequences associated with things 
going wrong in these areas. Companies can benefit 
from developing professionals who combine mastery 
of risk management, knowledge of unique compliance 
requirements, and general industry know-how. 

Which non-risk-related occupations 
are the primary launching pads 
for people who enter the field?
Companies are hiring people into risk roles who 
started their careers in all sorts of other white-
collar professions. Some emerge as more common 
launching pads. Ten occupations were the starting 
points for 45 percent of these risk and compliance 
workers with nonrisk backgrounds, although they 
collectively account for just 5 percent of the varied 
“desk jobs” that feed into the field (Exhibit 3). The 
greatest numbers were sales representatives, 
financial analysts, accountants and auditors, 
management analysts, and engineers.

When moving into risk-related occupations, almost 
60 percent of those with nonrisk backgrounds 
navigate skill distances that are smaller than the 
average needed to enter the field. They include 

those who came from nine of the ten most common 
nonrisk starting occupations (with engineers being 
the exception). These jobs involve transferable 
skills, which makes a move into risk viable. Financial 
analysts, accountants and auditors, some marketing 
professionals, and customer service representatives 
all bridge a skill distance of 30 percent or less 
when they enter risk occupations. They are able 
to apply existing skills such as cost analyses, 
stakeholder presentations, and report preparation 
and dissemination while adding new capabilities 
such as regulation impact evaluation, procedure 
monitoring, and scenario planning.

But people can and do make bigger professional 
leaps. Some 40 percent of workers entering 
risk from other types of occupations bridged an 
above-average skill gap; in fact, almost half of this 
group overcame a skill distance of 50 percent or 
more. This group includes people who started their 
careers as insurance sales agents, teachers, and 
billing clerks. For example, one individual in our data 
set worked as a head cashier for a communications 
company for a few years before becoming a Title 
31 compliance officer, a job that involves reporting 
large casino transactions to thwart money 
laundering and identity theft. This career move 
involved a skill distance of about 70 percent. 

Hiring managers can take a chance on someone 
who doesn’t fit the mold precisely if they see 
that the candidate’s mind works in a way that 
meshes with what the role requires. Regardless 
of starting occupations, workers moving into risk 
and compliance for the first time generally bring a 

Companies are hiring people into risk 
roles who started their careers in all 
sorts of other white-collar professions.

set of transversal skills from their prior experience. 
These include information processing (the ability to 
compile, categorize, tabulate, audit, and verify data 
quickly and accurately), inductive reasoning (the 
ability to combine pieces of information and form 
general conclusions), and the ability to navigate a 
complex organization and influence others. These 
skills are not specific to any given domain, and they 
can make someone a great candidate for a role 
in risk and compliance. Importantly, selecting for 
these skills can remove the “paper ceiling”8 that 

often blocks many talented candidates without 
college degrees (including underrepresented 
minorities) from certain roles. 

Few people stay on a risk 
and compliance career track 
over the long term
In addition to documenting how thousands of risk 
professionals first entered the workforce, our data set 
shows the subsequent paths of people who started

are leading them out of the discipline altogether. 

and fraud at another financial company, then 
assumed a more general senior operational risk 
management role. 

Eighty-seven percent of the workers in our data set 
who started in risk and compliance roles did not stay 
in the field. This is higher than the 67 percent of the 
total workers in our sample who left their starting 
occupational category (Exhibit 4). 

The 13 percent who stayed in the risk profession 
throughout their observed work histories continued 
to make role moves and add skills over time. More 
than half of that group moved into a different risk 
occupation, a different industry, or both. One worker 
in our sample started as a financial examiner with 
a consumer discretionary company before taking 
a job as a compliance officer with a financial 
services company. After accumulating a few years 
of experience in that role, this individual went on 
to become the director of anti–money laundering 

Many professionals appear to be treating risk and 
compliance jobs as training grounds rather than 
destinations—and this is not necessarily detrimental. 
It can be healthy for individual companies if 
workers rotate in and out of risk to become more 
well-rounded. They bring differing operational 
perspectives into the risk function, then diffuse what 
they learned into the fabric of the organization when 
their stint is over. It can also be healthy for broader 
industries to have risk professionals moving across 
companies (or even from industry to industry) to 
cross-pollinate best practices. 

But should companies be concerned about the rate 
at which people are leaving the field altogether? 
If they have a thoughtfully designed rotational

mindset and related experience, perhaps not. But in 
the absence of a deliberate rotational strategy, high 
turnover could be occurring because people dislike 
the roles as structured or cannot see paths to 
advancement. Companies in this boat need to take 
action to avoid developing but then losing expertise 
and institutional memory. 

Meanwhile, demand does not appear to be waning 
anytime soon. Filling roles with people who are 
new to risk is one strategy for meeting demand; 
rotational programs are another. But companies 
need to think simultaneously about retaining people 
for the long haul.

Companies can create a stronger 
employee value proposition 
in risk and compliance
As our complex and interconnected world has gotten 
more volatile, the stakes associated with getting 
risk management right have never been higher. With 
risk and compliance becoming increasingly vital 
functions, companies need to position the field as 
a desirable career path that will attract more entry-
level talent and ensure that more people stay in the 
field to develop expertise over time.

A key place to start is by articulating the purpose 
attached to risk roles. In a 2021 McKinsey survey,9 
70 percent of respondents said that their individual 
sense of purpose is largely defined by their work; 
the importance of meaningful work was especially 
pronounced among younger respondents. Roles 
focused on climate and sustainability risks, in 
particular, may resonate with Gen Z workers. The 
risk function has a clear purpose attached to it: 
ensuring the organization’s stability, customer 
safety, and adherence to the rule of law. Beyond 
promoting these values in the hiring process, 
managers can help people see how their day-to-day 
work contributes to these priorities and recognize 
them as key contributors to the business.

Another priority for improving the appeal of risk 
as a professional path is reevaluating the day-to-
day experience and responsibilities of specific 

roles. Some of them, particularly more junior-level 
compliance roles, have traditionally involved 
detailed review and documentation to ensure that 
regulations are followed to the letter and that all 
government reporting requirements are met. If 
companies situate this work in the back office, 
siloed away from frontline operations, it stands to 
reason that people might leave the field to vary their 
experience and raise their profiles. Now, however, 
compliance management systems can remove 
some of the administrative burden, which opens the 
door to making compliance jobs into meatier roles 
where workers can exercise more judgment.

In addition to reexamining and perhaps redesigning 
specific roles, clear learning and advancement tracks 
can help junior-level professionals develop into 
senior risk leaders. People need coaching and well-
designed learning pathways to make a mental jump 
from documenting adherence to rules to thinking 
more holistically about potential threats and shoring 
up vulnerabilities. One aspect of this is becoming 
fluent with predictive analytics and the scenario 
modeling tools that are transforming the field. 
Companies can create a win-win by adopting cutting-
edge risk management technologies and creating 
learning programs for mastering them, whether 
internal or external.

Another option for breaking down silos and 
formalizing risk training could be lateral rotations. 
This could have the benefit of giving employees 
in other functions a solid grounding in why risk 
management matters while giving junior-level 
risk professionals more exposure and a better 
understanding of the risk-related challenges 
on the front lines. Beyond rotations, involving 
risk and compliance employees in other types of 
cross-functional initiatives could improve their 
connectivity with the rest of the company.

Compensation is another important lever for 
attracting and retaining risk talent, just as it is in 
any tight market. In tracking the career moves 
people made over time, our data set showed that 
people who started in risk-related jobs were on 
track to roughly match the lifetime earnings of 
“desk workers” who started in nonrisk jobs across

all industries. They are on track for 1.1 times higher 
lifetime earnings than the average worker—but 
tech professionals, who are similarly in demand, 
are on track for lifetime earnings that are 1.3 times 
higher than the average. While risk careers are a 
solid earning option, compensation may need to be 
reassessed if companies continue to expand their 
risk teams, extending a war for talent.

As the nature of risk management changes, 
companies have an opportunity to elevate the 

entire function and bring more of it out of the back 
office. It is possible to make this happen; after all, in 
the not-too-distant past, technology professionals 
were mostly walled off in IT departments and help 
desks. Now they are front and center in every aspect 
of corporate operations. In a volatile world, risk 
management similarly needs to permeate the broader 
organization and inform both operations and strategy. 
Risk and compliance professionals at all levels need 
opportunities to grow in tandem with the field.

How Ukrainian businesses 
endured amid extreme 
uncertainty

Ukrainian businesses that have survived and thrived in the face of  
an unforeseen Russian invasion offer lessons in resilience.

In the 14 months since Russia invaded Ukraine, 
Ukraine’s military successes have deservedly 
captured the world’s attention.

To compile data for this article, we surveyed 
executives across more than 100 Ukrainian 
businesses, analyzed economic data, and 
interviewed Ukraine’s top business leaders.

No less deserving of attention is the resilience of 
civilian Ukrainian businesses. Their ability to survive 
and, in many ways, thrive in extremely difficult 
situations is justifiably a source of pride and deserves 
to be recognized and celebrated far beyond 
Ukraine’s borders.

Organizations around the world routinely ask 
themselves the question: “How do I prepare  
to respond to the unknow able?” Yet examples  
of actual unknowable events are elusive. The 
Russian invasion, especially the attack on Kyiv, 
represents a unique class of events: one that  
had not been a part of any scenario build, gave  
little clear warning ahead of time, scaled within 
hours, and had a large, immediate, and irreversible 
impact on companies across the country. The 
lessons learned in this situation apply to any 
company hoping to create a tool kit to deal with  
true black swans.

Impact of the invasion on  
Ukrainian businesses
To say that conducting routine business in Ukraine 
has been difficult is an understatement. For more 
than a year, Ukrainian businesses and citizens have 
endured a 600-mile front line with territories under 
regular shelling, energy infrastructure attacks  
that decreased electricity generation capacity by 
half, and disrupted fuel supply chains and damaged 
refineries, the latter leading to hours of waiting  
in gas station lines to get just ten to 20 liters (2.5 to 
5.5 gallons) of fuel.

As we have detailed in other articles, the invasion 
has ravaged lives and livelihoods across the nation. 
Beyond the enormous human sacrifices and  
the many wounded as a direct result of the war,  
6.9 million in-country Ukrainians have been

“We didn’t really believe [there would be] a 
war since, like most other entrepreneurs, 
we thought only the escalation in the east 
was possible. However, we still had a plan 
for a crisis. On the first day of the war, top 
management and co-owners met in the 
office and decided to dedicate that day to 
ensuring the safety of our own families as 
well as the families of our coworkers. From 
the second day of the war, management 
was gathering in the reserve headquarters, 
adjusting logistics models and implement-
ing reactive actions. Our core decision 

was to continue operations—all in all, the 
company was idle for only one day.

the branch open for several days to give out 
all the parcels that were already there.

Regardless of our plan, the situation we 
faced was far from ideal. In the first week 
of the war, the volume of our deliveries 
dropped by 95 percent. Our logistic 
terminals and big branches were attacked 
with rockets. We demonstrated our resil-
ience—the second day after the attack, 
our terminal or branch would reopen and 
operate. We lost connection with some of 
our branches for days, but even when the 

The change in the logistics market occurred 
in mid-March: we reached 30 percent of 
the prewar volume of parcels; in May it was 
already 65 percent; and in July, 80 percent. 
We worked 24/7 to hold on and restore  
our volume. Having the client’s parcel as 
the center of the operations and tracking its 
each movement helped us stay afloat.”

The economy has been ravaged, contracting by

operations completely, mostly as a result of business-
critical facilities being inoperable or inaccessible  
due to the conflict. Nearly two-thirds (63 percent) 
suffered a large negative impact in some form, but 
not to a degree that required suspending operations. 
About 20 percent of companies experienced little 
direct impact and continued business as usual. About 
15 percent experienced a positive momentum—
typically companies in the transportation and 
banking sectors that were aided by a spike in 
demand for transportation services (especially truck

majority of companies (nearly 80 percent) lost more 
than 10 to 30 percent of their total sales—a heavy 
impact for any organization. This reduction in demand 
has been the biggest challenge that Ukrainian 
businesses have had to navigate—more so than 
physical attacks on facilities, disrupted supply 
chains, interruptions in energy supply, or impact on 
employee morale (Exhibit 2). The reduction occurred 
for two reasons. First, as real incomes deteriorated, 
partly due to persistent unemployment, consumer 
spending suffered. This is likely to remain a major 
challenge for Ukrainian businesses in the foreseeable 
future. Second, companies that relied on physical 
storefronts have seen a large drop in footfall. Sixty-
seven percent of retailers, for instance, felt that 

military attacks on their facilities and stores were 
the largest threat they faced.

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023aware of the speed with which issues could escalate, 
the scale of the recent invasion, and the bombing  
of most of Ukraine’s biggest cities, Kyiv in particular, 
was not something many expected. Of the leaders 
we interviewed and surveyed, none had prepared 
for an invasion of this scale. Nonetheless, businesses 
responded quickly—and largely successfully— 
in four critical areas.

Providing people with safety and purpose
For businesses, the focus on people meant both 
providing safety for employees and maintaining 
their morale and motivation. The early emphasis, 
almost universally, was a focus on safety. The 
mechanics of obtaining employee head counts, 
ensuring employee relocation to safer locations, 
and structuring outreach to families quickly became 
an urgent, nontrivial task. Within the first week, 
however, the focus shifted. As companies’ assets 
were bombed and critical infrastructure came 
under recurring attack, initial concerns about safety 
evolved into maintaining operations despite the 
extreme situation.

This push worked. Ninety percent of companies 
that suffered physical damage to facilities remained 
open (or reopened quickly). Many of these companies 
had to close, relocate, or find work-arounds for 
parts of their operations, but the company operations 

overall remained up and running. While this outcome 
seems almost natural in hindsight, motivating 
employees to return to workplaces during ambiguity 
and under dangerous working conditions required 
significantly more than just monetary reimbursement. 
In the context of war, employees working in 
companies that placed a significant emphasis 
on values and purpose, beyond pure financial 
incentives, were much more likely to continue to 
show up to work, because they understood the 
importance of their work to a broader society.

Partly because of this focus, Ukrainian businesses 
retained most of their employees. Two-thirds of 
companies have maintained more than 90 percent 
of their workforce a year into the conflict.

Nerve center: A shift to a wartime operating model
Given the constantly shifting reality of the situation, 
ensuring continuity required flexible problem-solving  
on a near-hourly basis across all levels of organi-
zations. This was particularly important as initial 
assumptions turned out to be incorrect and had to 
be changed quickly. For instance, shortly after  
the start of the invasion, many business leaders 
assumed that the first impact would be on 
communications. They started to put in place  
work-arounds to address this. A communications 
breakdown, however, never materialized in a 

Igor Khyzhnyak, CEO of Comfy, a consumer electronics retailer

“We have always been maintaining a focus 
on corporate culture, open communications, 
and shared values. From the first days of the 
full-scale invasion, I openly communicated 
with the team about the situation in the 
company by hosting daily live streams from 
the office, stores, or on the road, while at 
the same time supporting employees with 
relocating and settling in the safer regions—
this made employees feel engaged 
and valued. Second, Comfy has been 
consistently proving its values orientation 

by supporting Ukrainian defenders and 
volunteers from 2014, but in 2022, we 
doubled down on social responsibility. 
Organizing support of defenders and 
volunteers has united employees around 
a shared mission: protecting Ukrainian 
independence. As a result, we saw that 
the employer NPS [net promoter score] 
grew significantly, suggesting employees 
are proud to be part of Comfy. Focus on 
communications, culture, and values helped 
us ensure full transparency and made 

employees more engaged and motivated. 
For example, during the first days of war, 
when we were reluctant to reopen stores 
and bring employees to workplaces, teams 
in some stores proactively reached out, 
asking for permission to reopen stores and 
start working. Another example is the team 
of the store in the occupied city of Melitopol 
volunteered to organize a campaign to 
encourage looters to return stolen goods. 
Many people actually returned, and some 
even paid for, the stolen appliances.”

of IT company SoftServe

“We have developed a separate organizational structure to run 
the company in wartime. This management group was meeting 
every day to discuss key problems and to take agile actions: 
What is the situation with the clients? Are our people safe? What is 
happening on the battlefield? The group was responsible for both 
controlling the contingency plan execution, including providing 
business continuity (access to electricity with generators, access 
to internet with the help of Starlink and fiber-optic connections) and 
responding to unexpected challenges, such as escalation of war, in  
a fast and agile way. In order to focus on the most critical tasks, 
some of the noncore decisions were fully delegated to branch 
offices so that the wartime management was taking care of the 
most urgent matters.”

meaningful way. The first major infrastructure 
problem (in the areas not directly affected by 
conflict) turned out to be a debilitating lack of fuel. 
As companies started to resolve the fuel issue,  
the energy infrastructure was affected. The 
response to this called for an organizational ability 
that could not be achieved through normal  
opera tions. It required standing up some version  
of a “nerve center”—a specific organizational 
architecture that allows institutions to navigate 
fast-moving disruptions. Decision making moved, 
for instance, to cross-silo teams focused on specific 
outcomes, and interaction among different parts of 
the organization occurred in a more fluid way.

This sense of purpose and an operating model 
that emphasized agility proved to be the two most 
powerful forces that allowed companies to navigate 
the crisis (Exhibit 3).

Fadi Hraibi, chairman of the board of steel 
company Interpipe

“One of the core factors of our resilience during the war was our 
strategic decision of diversification of the sales market. About 
seven years ago, we decided to have no more than 15 percent of 
our revenue in a single market. This decision was driven by the hit in 
2014, when Ukraine was first attacked in the east and started  
to break bonds with Russia. Although this decision sometimes 
caps our revenue potential in the growing markets, it helps us 
diversify the risks and withstand major disruptions. In 2022, our 
diversification strategy helped us to quickly adjust and avoid major 
losses when the market structure and supply chain blocked some of 
the markets—it was relatively easy to refocus and double down  
on the market with rising demand and prices to avoid significant 
revenue loss.” 

Igor Smelyansky, CEO of postal  
company Ukrposhta

“Looking back, one of the core factors of withstanding the war was 
personal leadership—showing employees that the situation is under  
control, and everyone is at their place working. In this way people 
felt safe and appreciated, while the leadership felt empowered and 
deter mined to keep it going this way. The message was that  
the engine of the company is running and each of us is a critical part 
of it. Although people were motivated by brave country leadership, 
mobilizing them to continue working for the company required 
leadership of the company to show that they are sharing risk and

the importance of the company for millions of people in this trying

and able to make decisions fast.”

dealing with a full-scale war. It turned out that 
several elements of the contingency plans already  
in place were universally helpful, allowing organi-
zations to respond faster than they otherwise might 
have done.

Successful Ukrainian businesses often use 
diversification strategies to address Achilles’ 
heels such as vulnerable business lines and over-
dependence on single revenue sources, suppliers, 
and locations.

Contrast that approach with diversification outside 
of war. For many, it is a strategic choice frequently 
implemented in a cautious way—a so-called 
no-regret move—in the hopes of avoiding significant 
losses to the potential earnings in a business- 
as-usual scenario.

But diversification of the “core pain points” suggests 
prioritizing strategic resilience over potential 
marginal earnings. Companies can invest in 
resilience, even if it is not economically attractive or 
it means giving up some growth opportunities.

Personal commitment
Senior leaders gained new appreciation for their 
position as role models. Their decision to be present, 
communicating early and sincerely, also appeared  
to play an important role in setting employee 
aspirations on presence and continuity, inspired in 
part by the actions of the country’s leaders.

Future focus, and what businesses are 
hoping to do differently
Inevitably, navigating such an extreme, uncertain 
situation for so long meant that businesses faced 
more than their fair share of disappointments. 
Based on this experience, there are three areas that 
leaders are focusing on moving forward (Exhibit 4).

Increased diversification of supply 
chain and revenue sources
After the attack on Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian 
companies that were exposed to Russian markets 
and markets in east Ukraine suffered a sharp fall  
in revenue. As a result, many Ukrainian companies

originally pursued active attempts at diversification 
across geographies and the sector.

However, for many companies, this diversification 
push lost steam after some initial moves, as other 
business priorities, the passage of time, and 
optimism bias crowded out that initial focus. 
Reinstating this focus has become a priority for 
many businesses. Forty-nine percent of respon-
dents listed this as their top priority to get right, 
especially after the invasion and even at the cost of 
additional investments.

Building a resilient workforce
As the war enters its second year, business leaders 
are especially focused on the question of how to 
maintain momentum as initial adrenaline wears off 
and the challenges of prolonged conflict mount. 
They are focused on building greater resilience 
in their workforce through several mechanisms: 
formal capability building that emphasizes flexibility, 
greater situational awareness and problem-solving, 
establishing escalation mechanisms and protocols, 
regular use of tools such as premortems, and 
continuing to build trust within their teams.

Injecting imagination into resilience 
and scenario planning
A consistent theme among leaders is how to inject 
more imagination into scenario planning. One way 
that businesses are considering approaching this is 
to pick examples of historical issues, including  
ones that never became major crises, and use “what 
if” thinking to review the different ways in which  
they could have become far larger challenges. They 
would then test their strategic plans against these 
hypothetical outcomes and ensure that they  
are robust. Twenty-nine percent of leaders across 
Ukraine listed scenario planning as their top  
priority moving forward.

The lessons that Ukraine’s businesses 
can teach leaders globally
Some of the lessons that Ukrainian businesses  
can teach us are ones that we have already learned 
from other contexts. Nerve centers and agile 
operating models, for instance, were critical enablers 
of fast response during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Yet, as the sense of urgency faded, many organiza-
tions around the world found it tough to sustain  
that momentum. Ukraine serves as an important 
reminder that shared purpose, hope, and personal 
commitment during a major disruption can 
sometimes do what traditional levers cannot.  

36

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023It also serves as a reminder of how easily hard- 
won lessons (for instance, on scenario planning 
and testing Achilles’ heels) can be lost as a major 
disruption fades from memory and smaller day-to-
day challenges take its place.

These experiences also offer some surprises that 
are not commonly discussed in traditional resilience 
planning. The focus on building resilience in  
supply chains and navigating geopolitical shifts 
over the past few years has reduced the attention 
management teams give to revenue diversification. 
It is entirely possible that, if the macroeconomic 
environment continues its shift toward lower 
consumer demand, having such revenue diversi-
fication will be one of the dimensions that  
shapes future success. It also offers an important 
perspective on the need to build a resilient 

workforce—a challenge that isn’t unique to Ukraine. 
Many companies today struggle to ensure the right 
balance of judgment, situational awareness, and 
proactive action orientation in their workforce at all 
levels. They also struggle with enabling leaders  
at every level to dust themselves off after a setback 
and recommit to the path forward. The tools that 
Ukrainian businesses are using, from providing 
purpose and hope to creating tangible tool kits 
to enable escalations of protocols, could become 
important sources of insight for businesses around 
the world.

Above all, Ukrainian businesses, civilians, and 
soldiers are collectively showing the rest of the world 
how quiet resolve and determination—to persevere, 
survive, and thrive as a free society—can shape 
remarkable outcomes.

Over the past few years, many banks have made 
public commitments to reduce their “financed 
emissions,”1 meaning the emissions they finance 
in the real economy, in line with the objectives of 
the Paris Agreement. This commitment is seen in 
the number of banks joining the Net-Zero Banking 
Alliance (NZBA), which grew from 43 to 122 banks, 
representing 40 percent of global banking assets, 
in just over a year. Membership requires that banks 
commit to transitioning the emissions from their 
lending and investment portfolios to align with a 
net-zero pathway. Even more banks have conducted 
internal assessments of their financed emissions 
and are considering whether they want to set a 
public target. Yet more are considering the journey 
to measure and set targets for their financed 
emissions. Stakeholders increasingly expect 
such efforts, and in many geographies, emerging 
regulatory requirements will change the disclosure 
of financed emissions from a voluntary task to one 
required by financial or securities regulation.

The process of assessing and setting targets for 
financed emissions is far from simple. It involves 
multiple complexities arising from differences 
between sectors, geographic variation, shifting 
counterparty plans, changing industry standards, 
and a nascent and rapidly evolving data 
environment, to name a few forces. Furthermore, 
the actions that banks take to achieve targets 

often create pressure on other objectives, such 
as revenue growth in critical business areas, and 
require changes to key processes and policies—a 
situation that calls for careful reconciliation. Finally, 
banks must balance their goal of reducing financed 
emissions with the simultaneous goal of financing 
reduced emissions—which often involves increasing 
financing to responsibly heavy emitters who need 
capital to decarbonize their businesses.

Against this backdrop, best practices are emerging. 
These can enable banks to create durable, reliable 
emissions measurement capabilities; set and 
monitor progress toward well-defined targets; and 
identify opportunities to support clients in their 
decarbonization transition. In this article, we outline 
some of the most critical insights for conducting 
effective financed emissions baselining and target 
setting, following a six-step process (Exhibit 1). 

Step 1: Measuring the financed 
emissions baseline 
Before they can set objectives, decision makers 
need to establish their starting point. The emission 
baseline is a “footprint”—a measure of emissions in 
a specific time period, such as a year—that is taken 
as the starting point against which to measure 
change. A robust and accurate baseline is critical 
to understanding the current state of a bank’s

Iterative process

1   “Financed emissions” fall into Scope 3, category 15 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The relevant industry bodies are discussing an additional 
category, “facilitated emissions,” meaning emissions that arise from facilitation activities by capital markets. Because this category is not yet a 
requirement for disclosure, it is not a focus of this article.

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023business, the distance to be traveled, and the 
practical client and operational considerations that 
must be addressed.

Building a robust emissions baseline requires clear 
definitions of what the bank will measure in terms of 
the following criteria:

 — Breadth of sector coverage. Most banks 

that have measured their financed emissions 
baseline have started with a short list of 
prioritized heavy-emitting sectors, such as oil 
and gas, power generation, automotive, and 
mining. The NZBA requires its members to 
eventually set sector-level targets for priority 
sectors: agriculture, aluminum, cement, coal, 
commercial real estate, residential real estate, 
iron and steel, oil and gas, power generation, 
and transport. It is important to note that 
the Science Based Targets initiative has set 
standards for some, but not all, of these sectors. 
We recommend undertaking this exercise 
in waves, starting initially with a few priority 
sectors and then moving to cover the remaining 
sectors required by NZBA and regulation, as 
well as any other sectors that constitute the 
majority of a bank’s portfolio. This creates 
a comprehensive view of the portfolio and 
prepares the organization for measurement and 
action on climate commitment. 

 — Asset class coverage. Currently, the Partnership 
for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)—the 
financial industry’s primary greenhouse-gas 
accounting standards body—has provided 
guidance for six asset classes: listed equities 
and corporate bonds, business loans and 
unlisted equities, project finance, commercial 
real estate, mortgages, and motor vehicle loans. 
Draft methods have also been published for 
green bonds, sovereign bonds, and emissions 
removals. However, the coverage may extend 
further, as many banks have significant 
portfolios in other asset classes.2 

 — Parts of value chain included. Typically, banks 
include only specified value chain components 
in the baseline. This follows the approach 
pioneered by the Katowice banks as part of the 
Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment 
(PACTA) developed by the 2° Investing Initiative 
(2DII).3 The value chain segments in focus are 
those that control the source of the majority of 
emissions in a given sector. For example, for 
automotive manufacturing, the focus is ordinarily 
on automotive manufacturers (not upstream 
suppliers of parts or downstream users), as 
they control the choice of vehicle engine, which 
ultimately determines emissions.  

 — Greenhouse gases included. Some banks 
have included only CO2 in their emissions 
measurement, but other gases, especially 
methane, are critical drivers of emissions in 
certain sectors, including oil and gas and 
especially agriculture. We recommend as broad 
a definition as feasible, including all greenhouse 
gases, especially where they constitute the 
majority of emissions, as in agriculture. Doing so 
allows the bank to obtain a more holistic picture 
of its emissions baseline. The resulting data can 
be captured in a CO2-equivalent metric. 

 — Scope of emissions. For covered counterparties 
in the bank’s portfolio, the baseline typically 
should include Scope 1 emissions (direct 
emissions, as from fossil-fuel combustion) and 
Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions, as from 
purchasing electricity, heat, or steam). It should 
include Scope 3 emissions (emissions from 
use of products) where they are material, as in 
oil, gas, and mining. We recommend including 
Scope 3 in part because international standards 
and regulatory requirements tend to include 
Scope 3—but also because insight into Scope 3 
at a counterparty level is critical to enabling 
business development activities.

41

 — Time period for baseline. Most guidance 

recommends using the latest available year, 
which often means at least a one-year lag, 
based on when emissions reports are available. 
We recommend using the latest available data 
and noting any trends that affect potential target 
setting, with some exceptions where explicitly 
guided by industry standards (for example, in 
aviation, where the COVID-19 pandemic resulted 
in very different emissions profiles in 2020 and 
2021 than the norm). 

 — Legal entities and attribution. The measurement 

and attribution of emissions requires 
understanding in which sector the legal entities 
are active. For example, a diversified company 
might span multiple sectors. Sometimes 
financing might be identified for a specific 
purpose or sector, such as a renewable-
energy investment that requires bank finance; 
often, however, sector classification is not 
straightforward. We recommend taking as 
granular an approach as feasible, given the 
existing data, and considering a future tagging 
system to understand what will be financed. 

 — Data and attribution. In assessing portfolio 
emissions, banks should work to identify 
the best possible data source and decide 
how emissions are attributed. The climate 
data landscape is currently disparate and 
requires a carefully crafted data strategy that 
incorporates a clear climate data ownership 
model and an operating model for processes 
and procedures related to climate data 
acquisition and use, all built around a set of use 
cases. Often this requires combining multiple 
inputs—counterparties’ own data, third-party 
data sources, and where available, emissions 
estimates using public data sets for proxy 
development—and ensuring they are consistent. 
Estimates often rely on using emissions factors, 
which can be drawn from various sources (and 
are of varying quality). Corporate reporting of 
carbon emissions remains unstandardized in 

most geographies and is often not required for 
non-listed companies. However, efforts are 
under way to address this,4 which may increase 
data quality and coverage. 

 — Score the data. Working with the preceding 

criteria, the bank should assess the quality of 
the baseline data. Scoring methods exist for 
rating data coverage and quality; an example is 
PCAF’s data quality score. Scoring enables a 
better understanding of how reliable the data 
are and where improvements are needed for 
future iterations of the emissions baseline.

Step 2: Projecting the portfolio’s  
momentum case
Banks should build a momentum case—a view 
about what will happen to a given sector or given 
counterparty—for each sector. The momentum case 
is essentially the unmanaged outcome: If the bank 
continued to finance its current counterparties at 
the current rate, what would its financed emissions 
be next year, in 2025, and in 2030? The momentum 
case is based on counterparties’ announced targets 
and aspirations, industry and asset-level forecasts, 
and announced government policies and targets. 
Banks can also create bespoke scenarios and 
simulate sensitivities within the portfolio (for example, 
counterparties drawing on their lending facility, or 
counterparties missing their announced targets).

The projections in this step will be most accurate and 
relevant if the process includes the following efforts:

 — Detailed counterparty-level analysis of 

announced targets. Banks should deeply 
understand announced targets, particularly 
for the high-exposure and high-emission 
counterparties. In some cases, this requires 
translating different counterparties’ announced 
targets to a comparable metric and aligning 
targets set by parent companies with those of 
their subsidiaries, which typically have different 
emissions profiles and hence trajectories. This

assessments of how quickly a sector or 
large counterparties will decarbonize. 

work may get simpler, because sources that 
provide emissions data (for example, CDP, 
Planetrics by McKinsey, Transition Pathway 
Initiative, and Trucost) are starting to make data 
on targets available. 

 — Involvement of sector bankers and sector 
expertise. Because momentum cases are 
fundamentally views about a given sector or given 
counterparty, it is critical that a bank’s momentum 
cases take into account the knowledge of its 
individual bankers who serve clients in those 
sectors. This is particularly true in the sectors that 
are the largest exposures for a bank and where it 
likely has the most internal expertise. 

 — Accounting for realistic changes to the 

trajectory. Banks cannot simply base their 
momentum cases on the “house” view of each 
sector. A good momentum case needs to be 
derisked and account for realistic assessments 
of how quickly a sector or large counterparties 
will decarbonize. Even the best-laid plans for 
decarbonization may be derailed by exogenous 
disruptions, such as macroeconomic impacts, 
supply chain challenges, and regulatory 
changes. A bank must ensure that the 
momentum case is reliable, as it will constitute 
the basis for understanding the gap to target 
and the actions necessary to accelerate 
decarbonization. To account for uncertainty, 
some institutions have used a range of scenarios 
and outcomes, as opposed to single scenarios, 
in developing their momentum case. 

 — Embedding an understanding of technology 

assumptions. In some instances, the momentum 
case is predicated on the scaling of near-term 
technologies. Banks should start to build insight 
and expertise in these technologies, given the 
impact they could have on the reliability of their 
momentum case. 

 — Analysis of government policies to understand 
their impact. It is important to understand how 
government targets and existing and announced 
policies affect counterparties’ emissions, and 
therefore banks’ financed emissions. This is 
especially true in cross-cutting sectors such as 
power—which often represent the majority of 
counterparties’ Scope 2 emissions. For example, 
a target of 100 percent clean electricity, such 
as the US 2035 target, has an impact on the 
emissions intensity of electricity-intensive 
sectors such as aluminum. Last, there are  
ways for banks to accelerate the achievement  
of policy targets that provide opportunities  
for “green growth.” For example, a government 
target for a significant proportion of heat pumps 
in residential real estate creates a market for 
products that finance their deployment.

Step 3: Selecting a reference 
scenario to align the portfolio 
Once a bank understands the momentum case, it 
can model what it would take to align the portfolio 
with the Paris Agreement. In practice, there is not 
just one “Paris aligned” view of the world; rather, 

Managing financed emissions: How banks can support the net-zero transition

43

various organizations have published a range of 
reference scenarios. These represent pathways 
to Paris alignment and set out the associated 
temperature rises, probabilities, and emissions 
trajectories for particular sectors. 

A thoughtful choice of a reference scenario for a 
given sector requires consideration of three issues: 

 — Temperature ambition. The Paris Agreement 

expresses an objective to keep global temperatures 
well below 2°C higher than preindustrial levels—
ideally just 1.5°C higher. A pathway well below 2°C 
is very different from a 1.5° pathway: the latter 
requires much deeper and faster decarbonization, 
especially between now and 2030. Therefore, the 
bank’s choice of its temperature ambition has huge 
implications for the speed of transition required 
across the bank’s portfolio. The NZBA requires a 
1.5° pathway, which means that the more than one 
hundred banks in the alliance globally are required 
to align their lending with this pathway. 

 — Core scenario. The existing reference scenarios 
are published by organizations including the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,5 
International Energy Agency,6 Network for 
Greening the Financial System, One Earth 
Climate Model,7 and UN Inevitable Policy 
Response.8 Banks should choose a scenario for 
each sector for which they intend to set targets. 

Step 4: Determining whether 
and how to achieve the pathway 
and capture opportunities
Once the bank has established its financed emissions 
baseline, developed a momentum case, and selected 
a reference scenario, it has the information it needs 
for decision making, beginning with whether and how 
to achieve the reference scenario selected for each 
sector. It is critical for banks to assess if and how 
they can feasibly align with that pathway, taking into 
account the full set of business constraints they face.

In some exercises, this step receives too little 
attention. We believe that for banks to create a 
durable target approach, they must get this step 
right. A thorough process of feasibility assessment 
includes a few common components: 

 — Understand the business implications of 

potential targets. Banks need to assess what 
it would take, in terms of emissions reductions, 
new green and decarbonization finance, and 
P&L impact, to achieve the chosen reference 
scenario, while also considering capital 
allocation constraints, sectoral and counterparty 
concentration limits, and credit risk performance. 
Emissions feasibility assessments that are 
made in a vacuum—ignoring these realities—
are difficult to operationalize. Determining the 
potential range of impacts on the business 
requires scenario analysis (Exhibit 2). 

 — Scenario expansion. Off-the-shelf scenarios 
often lack the detail necessary to set targets 
for the bank’s priority sectors or geographies, 
or include assumptions that differ from a bank’s 
in-house views (for example, on new oil and gas 
exploration). Some banks therefore “augment” 
climate models to create custom versions of 
these scenarios, interpolating more specific 
geographic or industry-level data as required for 
their portfolios.

 — Extensive involvement of the business and 
risk. This exercise must include the business 
and risk leadership for the relevant sectors. 
Because the business and risk partners will be 
implementing the required changes to meet a 
pathway, it is critical that they fully understand 
the trade-offs required and the speed of the 
migration of the portfolio—and believe they can 
execute the plan while delivering against all the 
constraints above.

 — Identify execution levers required to achieve 
the target for each sector. Banks need to 
build a detailed approach to ensure that they 
achieve their emissions reductions target. A 
range of levers can be used to reduce financed 
emissions, including accelerating green finance 
and helping existing counterparties in their 
decarbonization transition. 

 — Purposefully identify growth opportunities. 
McKinsey Global Institute estimates that 
achievement of net zero will require about 
$9 trillion per year of capital expenditure until 
2050 in transport, buildings, infrastructure, 
power, agriculture, industry, and more.9 Banks 
that move quickly to embed net zero into their 
business execution will be best placed to 
capture share. Areas for growth need to go 

beyond classic green-finance activities such as 
renewables lending and green bonds. There will 
not be enough of that business, at a high enough 
return, to support a successful alignment of 
the portfolio. A feasible pathway will need to 
use decarbonization finance, for example, as 
a tool to grow while also aligning the portfolio 
with emissions reduction targets. This is true 
for lending, and as targets begin to include 
facilitated emissions, it will include higher return 
advisory businesses as well.  

 — Building capabilities to understand 

decarbonization technologies. Hard-to-abate 
sectors rely heavily on new technologies to 
achieve net-zero targets. Banks should start 
building the capabilities to understand these 
technologies; such capabilities will open up

business opportunities and support reliable 
credit assessments.  

Setting the target requires decisions in a few  
key areas: 

 — Explicitly address the use of carbon credits. 
Counterparties can use carbon credits to 
pursue two objectives: to become carbon 
neutral, they can compensate by purchasing 
avoidance and reduction credits, and to 
become net zero, they can neutralize by 
purchasing removal credits. Banks need a 
perspective on counterparty use of carbon 
credits, as well as an approach to prioritize real 
emission reductions.

Step 5: Setting a financed emissions  
target (if desired), based on the  
reference scenario
Based on the momentum case, the reference 
scenario, and the feasibility assessment, banks 
should then decide what the target should be. In 
practice, the process of setting targets overlaps 
with the earlier work of selecting a reference 
scenario. Determining whether scenarios are 
feasible would involve estimating the business 
impact of achieving the target associated with each 
scenario and evaluating whether meeting the target 
would be feasible. 

 — Financed emissions target metrics. Banks 

generally choose metrics from among the four 
commonly used metrics for financed emissions. 
These are absolute emissions (reduction in 
total sector-level financed emissions); physical 
intensity (reduction in emissions per unit of 
activity, such as kilometers traveled); economic 
intensity (reduction in emissions per unit of 
revenue); and absolute financing (reduction 
in exposure to a sector over time). In making 
a choice, considerations should include the 
metric’s potential impact on ability to finance 
clients and grow the portfolio, robustness in 
terms of outcomes for the environment, ease of 
tracking and measurement, levers available to 
meet the target, and relevance to the sector’s 
decarbonization pathway. Sometimes a bank 
adopts multiple metrics (see sidebar, “Other 
approaches to portfolio alignment”). 

 — Granularity. Most banks have publicly 

announced their targets at a sector level. 
However, many banks internally have cascaded 
those targets down to a more granular level, to 
ensure they are fully actionable. 

Other approaches to portfolio alignment

The Glasgow Financial Alliance for  
Net Zero refers to four other approaches 
that can be used to ensure portfolio 
alignment with a net-zero target: 

net-zero benchmark, expressed as 
a percentage indicating the extent 
to which a company undershot or 
overshot the target

builds on the benchmark-divergence 
model, translating this to a

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023 
 — How to handle decarbonization financing. A 
target focused purely on reducing financed 
emissions may not effectively address how to 
finance reduced emissions. In setting targets, 
banks should create credible ways to measure 
and report their transition financing while still 
meeting their financed emissions targets. 
This approach, addressing the demand for 
carbon, not just the supply of carbon, will be 
increasingly critical to the successful transition 
of a lending portfolio or an advisory book of 
business. This includes aligning with approaches 
being developed by bodies such as the 
International Capital Markets Association that 
have been exploring the structuring of financial 
instruments for decarbonization financing.

Step 6: Embedding execution and 
opportunity creation into the bank
For banks to reach targets, they must embed 
their net-zero commitments into their operations, 
including their commercial execution, credit 
operations, and management reporting. This 
effort needs to take into account the bank’s other 
constraints, including capital, liquidity, profitability, 
and reporting requirements. A complete effort 
involves several practices: 

 — Embed targets into credit policies, data, and 
incentives. To ensure alignment with their 
emissions targets, leading banks are building 
dedicated frameworks for activities including 
product development, credit assessment, and 
pricing. In addition, leading banks are beginning 
to embed emissions data into data collection 
processes and looking to digitize and automate 
the process of measuring financed emissions. 
Further, banks are starting to consider how to 
incentivize bankers to achieve net-zero targets, 
which can be challenging if the targets conflict 
with short-term returns. 

 — Measure, report, disclose, and adjust. 

Regulatory requirements and evolving investor 
expectations are leading banks to publish 
information on their emissions exposures and 
remediation activities. Many stakeholders 

are increasingly focused on the quality of that 
reporting and the credibility of commitments, 
including gaining more detailed insight into how 
banks will achieve and implement commitments. 
Finally, banks often caveat that there is some 
risk of restating the emissions baseline, as data 
and methodologies improve. 

 — Optimize the balance sheet for emissions. 
Ultimately, emissions are one more factor 
around which to optimize the balance sheet. 
Emission optimization helps make explicit 
the trade-off between emissions, financial 
objectives, and risk constraints. 

 — Exercise sectoral leadership in must-win 
sectors. In hard-to-abate sectors, some  
banks are working in collaboration with 
industry to develop solutions and standards. 
Banks and asset owners in the maritime 
industry, for example, have drafted the 
Poseidon Principles, which support climate 
standards and assessments specific to 
maritime shipping finance. 

 — Involve the board and management. In most 
banks, net-zero commitments have been 
approved by the board or CEO. During this 
process, it is important to go beyond traditional 
board governance committees (for example, 
risk and reputation) to tap into the expertise of 
all board members, including those who may 
have experience and insight into real-economy 
counterparties of the bank. In addition, it is 
important to bring the whole organization along 
on the journey. Robust and ongoing syndication 
is required with those on the ground, such as 
sector teams and those responsible for risk, 
finance, model risk management, and data. 

 — Acquire and retain talent and expertise. The 
industry is experiencing a shortage of deep 
and practical expertise on climate topics. It is 
critical that banks start now to improve their 
capabilities through both upskilling and hiring. 
Many new capabilities are required: capturing 
and appraising climate data, assessing clients’ 
emissions reduction targets and transition

plans, and forming a perspective on specific 
projects and strategies a client might adopt and 
developing new products and offerings. 

 — Get and manage climate data. Sourcing client-
level emissions data and other external climate 
data is very challenging; it often involves multiple 
data vendors and extracting client-level data from 
multiple sources, including often unstructured 
data sets. Several actions can support improved 
availability and usability of climate data, including 
assigning accountable data leads and clearly 
defining roles and responsibilities for data 
ownership and use, mapping the data landscape 
by priority use cases, building high-quality 
targeted data assets, and expanding the bank’s 
existing data architecture to incorporate climate 
data effectively. 

 — Build client engagement. Typically, banks 
have specialist groups handle emissions 

calculations and assessments in an initial set 
of priority sectors, which simplifies the initial 
task of involving the bankers and building their 
capabilities. However, as an institution starts 
to move to other sectors, involving the bankers 
and credit teams becomes critical. This requires 
a concerted effort on two fronts: building the 
capabilities of frontline teams and cascading 
emission reductions targets to priority clients, 
including development of client-level account 
plans for client engagement. 

Banks can play a critical role in facilitating an 
effective transition to a lower-carbon global 
economy. Banks can facilitate the growth of 
green alternatives and help companies that need 
to decarbonize. Through allocating capital and 
supporting their clients, they have the potential to 
be—as they must be—leaders in the transition.

A devilish duality:  
How CEOs can  
square resilience with 
net-zero promises

Amid turbulence on the path to net zero, leaders will have to be much 
nimbler to balance resilience with an energy future that is secure, 
affordable, and clean. Five actions can help.

What a difference a year makes. In November 
2021, business leaders showed up in force in 
Glasgow at the UN Climate Change Conference 
(COP26), pledging to take on the challenge of 
reaching net-zero greenhouse-gas-emission goals 
by 2050. While no one believed that the path to net 
zero would suddenly become easy, commitments 
made to target nearly 90 percent of CO2 emissions 
for reduction signaled that the private sector was 
truly engaged. Then major new headwinds began 
swirling: surging inflation, war in Europe, energy 
insecurity, and a potential global recession. Still, 
governments pressed ahead, passing major climate 
legislation packages in Europe and the United 
States. More than 3,000 companies have made 
commitments on net-zero pathways. 

At the time of COP26, McKinsey released a 
perspective on the requirements needed to secure 
a net-zero carbon emission transition.1 It was clear, 
given the challenges to deploying capital at scale, 
managing economic dislocations, and scaling up 
supply chains and infrastructure, that the path 
would not be linear and would include slowdowns 
and backstepping. Ultimately, sustainable systems 
are more value creating than traditional ones. But 
countries and companies must balance trade-offs 
among net-zero commitments, affordability for 
citizens, and security of energy and materials supply.

As disruptions have intensified, the moment 
confronts CEOs—an organization’s ultimate 
integrator—with a devilish duality. As net zero 
has become an organizing principle for business, 
executives are on the spot to lay out credibly how 
they will deliver a transition to net zero while building 
and reinforcing resilience against the certain 
volatility of ongoing economic and political shocks. 
The zigs and zags of present conditions will tempt 
some leaders with exclusive choices—doubling 
down on fossil fuels, for example, at the expense of 
new and emerging renewable technologies. Leaders 
will face multiple calls on their attention, as well as 
concerns about how quickly to drive a sustainability 
agenda forward.

We believe that the right response to such 
challenges has always been a matter of “and,” not 
“or”—that is, maintaining focus on the long term 
while adjusting in the face of present conditions 
rather than opting for one or the other. A resilient 
stance, being prepared to withstand shocks and 
poised to accelerate into a changed reality, permits 
companies to weather not just the current moment 
but also the future storms that are likely to come 
their way in a world of rising risks. 

The task is neither simple nor easy.2 Yet as leaders 
prepare to gather in Egypt for the 2022 UN Climate 
Change Conference (COP27), there is also good 
news: today’s reality is that sustainability, economic 
competitiveness, affordability, and national security 
dovetail as never before. To make the most of 
the situation, CEOs can shape strategy around 
resilience now to tap value-creating businesses 
tomorrow as the world continues to head toward net 
zero in the long run. In this article, we present five 
core actions to help meet the dual imperatives at the 
heart of a new sustainability strategy. 

Stormy weather
The path to net zero was always going to be fraught 
with complexities. Recently, several “weather fronts” 
have emerged, posing significant challenges to 
leaders across both the private and public sectors.

Energy availability and security
The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting 
energy crisis in Europe are reminders that, 
fundamentally, disruption in energy markets can 
wreak havoc on the global economy. In response, 
countries are boosting the use of fossil fuels, 
including coal and gas, and extending the life of 
conventional energy infrastructure, which is under 
growing pressure.

Physical risks are proliferating. Europe saw a 
record-breaking heat wave this summer. Floods 
devastated Pakistan this autumn, and tropical 
storms raged across Japan, the Koreas, and China.

50

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023In the United States, Texas saw an unprecedented 
grid failure in 2021, with a near miss in California 
this year. There are important choices to be made, 
some of which entail trade-offs between climate 
mitigation and climate adaptation—for example, 
rebuilding versus relocating and investing in 
cooling versus keeping energy consumption 
down—all of which occur within a limited envelope of 
infrastructure funding. 

Affordability
Prices are rising across the globe, driven by the 
energy crisis in Europe, the growing food crisis 
resulting from the invasion of Ukraine, and a 
recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that has 
been faster than expected, and, though welcome, 
has put pressure on supply chains. The outlook is 
ominously recessionary. 

There is a growing perception that net zero comes 
at the expense of affordability, with a zero-sum 
trade-off. The universal problems of supply chain 
and talent shortages complicate the equation, 
particularly as deployment for the new assets and 
infrastructure needed for the net-zero transition 
pick up. This, in turn, could result in price spikes 
for the key inputs needed for the net-zero transition. 
Companies also face growing challenges in securing 
the parts, labor, and specialized skills they need to 
execute on net-zero commitments. From heat pumps 
to recycled textiles and insulation installers to carbon 
management data scientists, companies are struggling 
to match supply to customer demand. 

Governance and regulation
A key tenet of any orderly transition to meeting net-
zero goals is demonstrating ongoing governance 
and cooperation among public- and private-sector 
institutions, meeting commitments, and maintaining 
public support for progress toward cutting 
greenhouse gases. The war in Ukraine has already 
reduced the potential for such cooperation. Also, the 
United States is seeing growing backlash against 
standardized environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) reporting requirements and skepticism of ESG 
funds that some criticize as punishing fossil-fuel 
producers and hurting local economies. The outlook 
for aligned standards, requirements, and public 
support is becoming murkier.

Shaping a resilient sustainability 
strategy
There is an increasingly popular view that leaders 
will need to navigate a zero-sum trade-off between 
addressing climate action headwinds and sticking 
to their commitments for achieving an orderly net-
zero transition. However, while the path to net zero 
will not be a straight line, and some regions will step 
back commitments for the short term, the long-term 
trajectory remains intact. 

More important, these discontinuities also create 
opportunities and imperatives. We believe that the 
potential is great to shape a resilient sustainability 
strategy that creates a virtuous cycle of managing 
short-term shocks; bolstering prospects for an 
affordable, clean, and secure energy future; and 
improving the long-term competitiveness and value 
creation of companies. In part, this is because 
competitors may be tempted to pause during this 
period of turbulence. That creates a chance for 
those who stay the course to gain strategic distance:

 — Energy independence via accelerated use 

of renewables and clean power and capture 
of the full potential of energy efficiency and 
distributed electricity. Diversifying the energy 
supply with renewables, green hydrogen, and 
green power promotes national energy security 
and economic competitiveness. In Europe, the 
invasion of Ukraine and the effort to develop 
a future free of dependence on Russian gas 
has prompted Europe to raise its commitment 
to renewables (alongside imported natural 
gas in the medium term and possibly nuclear 
power in the longer term). Of course, energy 
market resiliency must be built in tandem—for 
example, by rewarding the firming of capacity 
in power markets as the share of intermittent 
power generation grows. Even prior to the 
invasion of Ukraine, industrial policy across 
the larger European economies was focusing 
on clean-energy tech as a source of national 
competitiveness. Examples include European 
cleantech export policies, support for rare-
earth minerals needed for new climate tech, 
and national funding to drive local new-energy 
industrial growth (such as the US Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act). Companies that

operate in this space or serve those in it have 
clear long-term growth prospects.

 — New value from existing systems. It is 

becoming increasingly apparent that it may 
be possible to repurpose existing methods of 
carbon-intensive production with additional 
enabling technologies to future proof them for a 
sustainable future. Numerous examples—such 
as retrofitting existing industrial production 
facilities for carbon capture, use, and storage 
(CCUS); using hydrogen blends in methane 
carriers; and employing direct air capture 
(DAC)—are emerging to lower carbon intensity 
and transform existing systems into cleaner 
alternatives. Owners and operators of this 
infrastructure that invest in future proofing 
through CCUS, DAC, or other tech stand to 
make significant gains. Repurposing rather 
than stranding these assets will not just enable 
affordability and system resiliency but also 
provide incumbents with greater confidence that 
decarbonizing their legacy assets is feasible.

 — Sustainable materials transition. The energy 
transition requires a materials transition. 
Projected electric-vehicle demand, for example, 
will raise demand for cobalt, copper, lithium, 
nickel, and rare-earth minerals, putting 
further upward pressure on pricing across 
these commodity classes. Commitments to 
decarbonize automotive, consumer goods, 
packaging, and other sectors are also already 
driving supply–demand shortages in aluminum, 
plastics, and steel. We expect, for example, 
a 50 to 60 percent shortage of same-cycled 
plastics compared with demand in 2030, driving 
significant green premiums. If supply eventually 
meets demand, early movers will most stand 
to gain. With the current commodity cycle at 
a peak, cash can be reinvested in nascent 
materials opportunities that will be in clear 
demand in the longer term.

 — New sources of capital. Investors and 

incumbents have started a new wave of 
capital deployment toward net zero, including 
investments in new materials, new climate 
tech, and more adaptive supply chains. These 

investments are increasingly following a “private 
equity plus” model, with heavily involved 
investors helping build new green challengers 
from the outset. Countries and regions with 
hard-to-abate sectors are also increasingly 
important sources of climate tech and transition 
capital as they seek to decarbonize while 
preserving economic growth. These ventures 
are in their early stages as voluntary and 
policy-driven demand materializes and grows. 
But they demonstrate that while there is some 
ESG-related backlash, a broader set of clean 
investments are continuing to grow.

 — Voluntary carbon market (VCM) development. 

A critical pillar of enabling net zero and financing 
asset decarbonization is the ability to value 
carbon with liquidity. VCM will be critical. Although 
the situation is unsettled now, we see expanded 
dialogue and more concrete actions toward 
establishing VCM at the country and private-
financing levels. For example, several Southeast 
Asian governments are shaping national voluntary 
carbon exchanges, and company commitments to 
voluntary carbon have grown.

 — Reshaped value chains and reindustrialized 

nations. In some developed economies, game-
changing policies are supporting new net-zero 
value chain plays. The US Inflation Reduction Act 
commits $370 billion in climate spending, targeting 
the creation of new sustainable industries across 
the country and accelerating cleantech, such as 
green hydrogen. Another US legislative measure, 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is poised to 
prompt reindustrialization, replacing value chains 
based on internal-combustion engines with 
electric- and battery-based alternatives. In the 
European Union, the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU 
packages will create new winners across industries 
and reshape value chains in a way that brings 
affordability to the fore. New forms of public–
private partnerships will therefore also need to 
take shape. Instilling more control within regions 
and individual countries will enable them to protect 
against price shocks for citizens.

Done well, pursuing these opportunities should 
create a virtuous cycle for economies among 

52

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023affordability, decarbonization, energy security, 
job creation, and resilience. Renewable energy is 
one obvious example with the potential to promote 
energy security, create high-quality jobs, and 
reduce emissions in tandem. New sources of capital 
and VCM could make sustainable investments more 
affordable, bringing them to market sooner, and 
successful delivery of these projects would in turn 
boost returns and attract further capital. Sustainable 
materials could facilitate the energy transition 
while creating new value from existing systems and 
infrastructure. And so on. These examples illustrate 
the power and possibility of the “and”—a flywheel-like 
effect that enables meeting security, socioeconomic, 
and sustainability goals in parallel.

Across these opportunities, incumbents are 
positioned to succeed more often than not. 
Every incumbent player, especially in hard-to-
abate sectors, has two sets of opportunities: 
decarbonizing while extending fossil-fuel-based 
core business (potentially earning green premiums 
as a result, as early movers in sustainable materials 
already are) and building new sustainable 
businesses. Incumbents can use existing cash flows 
and strong balance sheets to fund new sustainable 
businesses that lay the foundation for future growth. 
They can afford to invest for the long haul and place 
bets across multiple new clean technologies—
another advantage when the end point is clear but 
the precise path to get there is not. 

Resilience today and value tomorrow: 
Five actions for CEOs
The pressure to demonstrate real progress on and 
create true value through sustainability is growing. 
The world has, however, entered an era that is 
increasingly challenging for CEOs and business 
leaders to navigate. There is a new strategic 
paradigm—one with reasonable certainty of where 
the world needs to be in the medium and long term 
and tremendous volatility in terms of how and when 
it will get there.

Leaders must build resilience to today’s shocks to 
build tomorrow’s champions. Some approaches will 
be easier than others and offer a good starting point.

Accelerate capital deployment with a private-
equity mindset
Leading with resilience while navigating toward 
net zero means participating early in the materials 
transition and green-business-building wave to 
secure exposure to promising innovations (exhibit). 
Earlier-cycle investments have higher risk but also 
higher returns because they benefit from early policy 
funding, greater willingness for counterparties to 
participate (for example, through sustainable aviation 
fuel contracts, which guarantee demand from airlines 
that allows investment in supply), new talent, and the 
opportunity to gain first-mover advantage in nascent 
and emerging value chains.

In many industries, there will be multiple sustainability 
winners. For example, we expect both hydrogen-
fueled and electric vehicles to be part of the 2050 
ground transport system. This is another reason to 
consider an investor mindset—spreading bets across 
multiple potential investments earlier. Companies can 
further manage their transition risk by aggressively 
pursuing operational decarbonization measures 
that already pay for themselves (for example, 
through energy efficiency) while making longer-term 
investments in sustainable infrastructure and building 
new businesses. Pursuing energy efficiency and 
rapidly scaling distributed clean heating (for example, 
via heat pumps) will become a critical lever in Europe 
to manage the energy crisis.

Play offense through a sustainable value  
creation strategy
Two objectives should be paramount: to extend 
and decarbonize the core business and to build 
new sustainable businesses in reshaped value 
chains. This would represent an “Apollo 11 moment” 
in many industries—a moon shot requiring not just 
incremental improvements but wholesale rethinking 
of how to build, operate, and maintain every sector 
of the economy. Leaders need to make quantum 
leaps to meet the moment, by getting smart on 
climate tech fast, engaging with the innovation 
ecosystem, and leveraging their engineering and 
business-building talent. Similarly, a focus on 
sustainability—and ESG measures, more broadly—
is defensible, pragmatic, and needed. CEOs can 
articulate their approach to ESG topics proactively

Go beyond net zero 
CEOs should also look to make their companies net 
nature positive. Actions include moving ahead in the 
game on biodiversity, demonstrating stewardship 

of shared water and air resources, ensuring a 
responsible supply chain, and contributing to a 
just transition, among other steps. Adaptation 
investments to address physical risks will also be 
critical. Companies able to weather the storm, 
literally, will have a material advantage. 

54

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023In some instances, sustainability aims come into 
conflict—for example, lithium brine operations are 
less carbon intensive than hard-rock extraction but 
consume far more water. CEOs will need to weigh 
current trade-offs carefully and invest in innovation 
that meets multiple aims, “squaring the circle” in an 
increasingly complex ecosystem. The bar is rising 
on sustainability; companies need to have a plan on 
these and other factors. 

example, requires fully rethinking design, 
manufacturing, procurement, marketing, and 
waste management processes while also better 
tracking carbon emissions and circularity. Talent 
across the organizations will need to reskill to 
meet these new demands. Companies need 
to identify the skills needed for their more 
sustainable business models and work toward 
acquiring them and building them internally. 

Build the partnership and ecosystem muscle
CEOs should realize that the challenge of maintaining 
resiliency while driving toward net zero is too great 
to go it alone. New public–private partnerships will 
be needed because many of the emerging energy 
and materials value chains will require full ecosystem 
development. Consider, for example, clean-fuel 
consortiums, such as those developing around 
hydrogen hubs, and shared CCUS networks. There 
are also opportunities to partner with competitors on 
shared tech road maps to mitigate tech risk and to 
better direct innovation funding. 

Aggressively reskill leadership teams, boards, 
and frontline workers
As companies embrace a sustainable future,  
they will need new skills. Sustainable fashion, for  

Navigating the current turbulent period for the 
net-zero agenda may require temporary responses 
that, in some cases, may look like setbacks. They 
need not be. CEOs who understand the virtues 
of strategic resilience know that addressing 
immediate hardship and building a sustainable 
future can—and should—be pursued at the same 
time. By maintaining vision, moving nimbly, playing 
offense, and embracing opportunity instead of 
recoiling from risk, leaders can improve the future 
of their businesses and the planet.

Resilience means understanding the criticality of a business process, 
the capability of the underlying technology, the business impact if the 
technology fails, and the organization’s risk tolerance.

It’s no secret that in highly competitive business 
environments, the demand for organizations to 
grow and increase revenue and profit continues to 
rise. While meeting the demand and staying current 
through digitalization, organizations must remain 
mindful to be efficient, maintain or reduce costs, 
and keep employee spending in line.

Moving forward in those two areas is difficult 
enough, but moving in those directions adds stress 
on corporate technology systems across the 
technology stack, from data to applications and 
network infrastructure. Technology constraints 
include capacity limitations, system uptime, data 
quality, and the ability to recover from a catastrophic 
technological, physical, or cyber event.

Resilient technology is critical in maintaining 
uninterrupted services for customers and servicing 
them during peak times. This requires a resilient 
infrastructure with heightened visibility and 
transparency across the technology stack to 
keep an organization functioning in the event of a 
cyberattack, data corruption, catastrophic system 
failure, or other types of incidents.

Resilient technology needs to be agile, scalable, 
flexible, recoverable, and interoperable. In addition, 
resilience needs to exist not only in the architecture 
and design but also through deployment and 
ongoing monitoring.

Understanding criticality
To achieve resilience, an organization needs to 
understand the criticality of a given process, 
evaluate the underlying technology, recognize the 
corresponding business impact, and know the 
risk tolerance of the organization and external 
stakeholders. To get there, an organization needs 
to understand where and what its resilience is 
today and be able to answer the question: Could we 
recover and rebuild after a catastrophic event?

that they have already attempted to recover from 
bare metal but were unsuccessful (for example, 
deliberate testing).

Additionally, 20 percent of respondents indicated they 
had already attempted to recover from bare metal and 
were successful, 8 percent attempted to recover from 
bare metal, 18 percent noted they had plans to attempt 
to recover from bare metal, while 36 percent stated 
there were no plans to recover from bare metal.

Technology resilience is the sum of practices and 
foundations necessary to architect and deploy 
technology safely across the technology stack 
(see sidebar “McKinsey technology resilience 
principles”). Technology resilience prepares 
organizations to overcome challenges when their 
technology stack is compromised, reducing the 
frequency of catastrophic events and enabling them 
to recover faster in the case of an event.

In the McKinsey survey, when asked what the 
recovery time objective was for their highest 
critical applications, 28 percent of respondents 
said immediate, while 34 percent said it was less 
than an hour, 14 percent said less than two hours, 
and 20 percent said less than four hours. One 
of the respondents in the survey stated, “Critical 
systems and applications down for a significant 
amount of time can cost financial institutions 
billions of dollars.”

Resilience capabilities fall on a maturity spectrum 
from simple redundancy to duplicate servers 
through to advanced capabilities with resilience 
built into architecture by design.

 — Architecture and design: Mature organizations 

incorporate technology resilience into enterprise 
design and architecture. Resilient designs 
incorporate elements of lessons learned from 
operations, incidents, and industry trends to 
make risk-informed technology investments. 

In a 2022 McKinsey survey on technology resilience 
that assessed the cybersecurity maturity level of 
more than 50 leading organizations across North 
America, Europe, and other developed markets,  
10 percent of respondents indicated they have been 
forced to rebuild from bare metal (for example, due 
to a catastrophic event), with 2 percent stating 

 — Deployment and operations: Resilient 

operations should consider not only operational 
contingencies, such as disaster recovery 
or performance demands that increase 
exponentially, but also the root cause of 
incidents that arise during business as usual  

58

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023McKinsey technology resilience principles

The following are five principles that 
we see as foundational for maintaining 
resilient technology:

 — Applications, systems, platforms, and 
the IT workforce itself are flexible 
and scalable. On an ad hoc basis, 
the enterprise can scale up or down 
services to support changing availability, 
capacity, or performance demands as 
business requirements shift. 

applications and are traceable within the 
environment. Owners are empowered 
to raise problems and prevent outages 
before they occur. 

compensate for probable failures (at 
lower maturities) and recursively inform 
future designs (at higher maturities). 

 — Data sets and applications are built to 
be agile and mobile. They must not be 
tied to a single platform or environment 
but rather can be rapidly moved 
between or across platforms as needed. 

 — Systems are interoperable and 

leverage standard API schemas that 
are defined and well-architected both 
internally and between and among 
third-party services.

 — Data sets, applications, and network 
technology infrastructure are 
fully visible to owners of data and 

 — The architecture of applications, data 
platforms, network environment, and 
the IT workforce is resilient by design—
that is, the architecture was built to 

to improve procedures, training, and tech- 
nology solutions. 

 — Monitoring and validation: This consists of reactive 
or backward-looking metrics at lower maturity 
levels. At higher maturity levels, organizations 
shift to more proactive (and ultimately predictive) 
measures to stress-test solutions prior to rollout or 
drill preplanned responses and contingency plans 
for the most likely eventualities. 

 — Response and recovery: Organizations with 
high technology resilience not only respond 
as incidents occur but also continuously feed 
lessons from their own operations, industry 
trends, and catastrophic events back into the 
design, operation, monitoring, and planning for 
their enterprises. 

Understanding the components behind the life 
cycle allows an organization to chart what its 
technology resilience journey looks like through four 
maturity levels. Levels one and two are foundational 
capabilities, while levels three and four are more 
advanced (Exhibit 1). 

Level one consists of basic capabilities where 
resilience is left to individual users and system 
owners, and monitoring involves users and 
customers reporting system outages. 

Level two consists of passive capabilities where 
resilience is through manual backups, duplicate systems, 
and daily data replication. There is also monitoring at  
the platform or data center level for system outages. 

Level three consists of active resilience through 
failover. Resilience exists through active 
synchronization of applications, systems, and 
databases, and active monitoring at the application 
level for early indicators of performance and 
stability issues. 

Level four consists of inherent resilience by design. 
Resilience is architected into the technology stack 
from the start through inherent redundancy and 
active monitoring at the data level, which includes 
anomaly detection and mitigation. 

From a life cycle standpoint, the range for 
architecture and design goes from limited visibility

of dependencies for critical and noncritical 
applications in level one to dependencies and data 
flows built in for resilience from initial design for 
critical and noncritical apps in level four.

For deployment and operations, regular system 
outages in level one take the place of resilience 
tests, and in level four, random, in-production 
failover tests validate resiliency.

In the case of monitoring and validation, in level 
one, users monitor their own systems for outages, 
whereas in level four, monitoring and alerting is built 
in by design, allowing for proactive response.

For response and recovery, responses to incidents 
in level one are ad hoc and based on best judgment, 
while in level four, detailed and diverse “break glass” 
procedures are drilled in by design.

Resilience spectrum
At the most basic level, resilience is left to the 
individual system owners and users. The database 
administrator is responsible for backups of 
organizational data, and individual employees must 
back up their own data. Moving along the maturity 
scale, organizations rely on centralized resilience 
capabilities managed by IT or a resilience function. 

Such an organization provides for centralized backup 
solutions, maintains redundant core systems, and 
monitors for system outages and application failures.

Resilience can be achieved passively by conducting 
manual backups daily. Shifting to an active 
approach involves monitoring for early indicators of 
data corruption or anomalous system behavior and 
taking preemptive action. Those indicators include 
an increasing volume of corrupt data, an unusually 
high number of brief network outages, and a 
greater than usual number of servers that require 
reboots. Active resilience further occurs through 
the continual synchronization of applications, 
systems, and databases such that redundancy is 
always maintained. Periodic failover tests are also 
conducted to validate resilience.

The most advanced level of resilience consists of 
inherent resilience. The primary differentiator is 
that resilience is built into the technology stack by 
design. Inherent resilience includes capabilities 
such as duplicate processing across systems, 
modular redundancy, and automatic fault tolerance 
within systems. True inherent redundancy enables 
the ability to conduct random in-production failover 
tests to validate resiliency. Only the technology that 
enables an organization’s most critical business 
processes needs to be inherently resilient by design.

resilience capability spectrum while making a 
continual shift toward active resilience.

nor can they be equally protected in today’s all-
encompassing digital environment. 

How to become resilient
It’s one thing to lay the groundwork and point out 
the issues behind resiliency, but just how does one 
get there? There are three keys to establishing and 
growing a more resilient technology environment:

1.  Blame-free culture: When problems arise,  

teams and managers don’t look for whom to blame. 
They focus on fixing the problem and preventing 
recurrences. Teams celebrate members who 
expose vulnerabilities and weaknesses as 
necessary to build more resilient technology. 

Some capabilities and underlying assets are more 
critical to a company and its business than others. In 
the case of a large electric utility, for example, these 
include the technology systems that enable the 
delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers. 
In the case of a global financial-services institution, 
the trading platforms and those that support 
customer transactions are most critical. The digital 
business model is, in fact, entirely dependent 
on trust and the ability to continuously provide 
customer-facing services. Ensuring resilience over 
those assets is at the heart of an effective strategy 
to protect against catastrophic events.

2.  Metric-driven approach: Teams relentlessly 

measure their own performance and focus on 
which incidents they created (for example, from 
releases or patches) or repeat incidents that have 
the same root cause. 

Three levers for building technology 
resilience
Reaching high maturity levels of technology 
resilience requires building the necessary capabilities 
and processes, using three levers as guidance. 

3.  Rehearse the outage: Teams anticipate 

1. 

problems and iteratively build up and train to 
respond to complete system outages. They 
build from individual applications to systems to 
products (systems of systems) to entire services. 

When asked in the McKinsey survey how often 
they test critical applications, slightly more than 
60 percent of respondents said they test at least 
quarterly. Of those, 14 percent said they test 
weekly, 26 percent test monthly, and 26 percent 
test quarterly. Overall, 28 percent said they test 
every six months, while 6 percent indicated they 
test annually. One respondent said, “There are 
quarterly tests. The most critical systems will 
be tested each time, less critical systems are 
spread out to every other test cycle or annual at a 
minimum.”

Risk-based resilience
Companies are moving to risk-based technology 
resilience (see sidebar “A European bank works 
toward technology resilience”). The approach 
recognizes that not all assets are created equal, 

 Prioritize services: Not all business services 
and systems should be treated equally when 
deploying technology resilience capabilities. 
Rather, organizations should define their  
most critical services. These comprise the 
crucial services needed to fulfill obligations  
to customers, business partners, regulators,  
and society. 

After identifying and obtaining cross-business 
agreement on these services, understanding the 
underlying technology landscape is essential, 
including which applications and systems 
enable the most critical business services, their 
dependencies, and how they are interconnected. 

Having visibility and transparency into the most 
critical services and underlying applications, 
systems, and dependencies allows for assessing 
the current resiliency level and prioritizing 
the target resiliency on an application-by-
application and system-by-system basis. 

In the McKinsey study on resilience, 
respondents were asked, “How long did it take

A European bank works toward technology resilience

Understanding technology resilience is 
an ongoing process, and by employing the 
three levers—prioritization, assessments, 
and remediation—organizations can find 
success. When it comes to technology 
resiliency, one European bank with 
traditional data centers recognized it 
needed to understand its deficiencies to 
be able to withstand any type of incident it 
might face, whether technologically based 
or cyber-related. 

Regulatory findings and recent crises 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, 
geopolitical conflicts, energy crises, and 
flood risks led management to evaluate 
and strengthen its technology resilience 
and crisis capabilities. 

Understanding that its technology 
landscape consisted of a mainframe 
and server environment that was largely 
on premises in data centers, the bank 
analyzed how it could enhance resiliency—
particularly by leveraging the cloud for out-

of-region recovery—and flexible scaling of 
resources and related services. 

The bank included cybersecurity and data 
privacy efforts to harmonize application 
and infrastructure requirements as one of 
the key levers for efficient implementation. 

An Asian fintech leverages  
cloud for resilience 
A fintech with a cloud-only infrastructure 
landscape launched its business and 
immediately faced security, performance, 
and scalability challenges. Through a 
review of the cloud configuration, the 
fintech identified gaps and set a path 
to enhance its resiliency. This was 
done primarily via the setup of regions/
availability zones, load balancing, data 
mirroring, and snapshots/backups 
combined with testing. The initiative 
enabled continuous service delivery in 
the face of outages and cyberattacks and 
supported the hypergrowth of customers 
using its services.

Oil and gas company transforms 
in face of acute threats 
A large oil and gas provider faced frequent 
cyberattacks, even as it undertook a digital 
transformation that had the potential 
to increase the exposure of its critical 
systems. A successful attack on its assets 
had the potential to affect the economy of 
an entire nation. 

The organization started by identifying 
and protecting its “crown jewels,” its most 
important assets, via a library of controls. 
This was supported by building capabilities 
and addressing silos (for example, between 
information technology and operational 
technology capabilities). The organization 
outlined and implemented its plan for a 
holistic cybersecurity transformation, 
including a three-year implementation 
program with prioritized initiatives, an 
estimated budget, and provisions to 
integrate technology resilience in its 
digitization effort.

you to get all your highest critical applications  
in line with recovery time objectives?” Here,  
26 percent of respondents said less than a year, 
while 28 percent said less than two years, and 
26 percent said less than three years. 

One survey respondent said, “Being clear on 
which systems are most critical is an ongoing 
challenge.” While another said, “It was during 
Superstorm Sandy that the bank became 
very concerned about its robustness, or lack 
thereof, and this became front and center 
immediately afterward.” 

2. 

 Assess current level of resilience and review 
past crises: The next step involves assessing 
existing technology resilience. Organizations 
should assess their maturity along the same 
S-curve of technology resilience, whether they 

have resilient architecture and capabilities, 
passive resilience capabilities, active resilience 
with failover capabilities, or are inherently 
resilient by design. 

Typically, organizations should assess current 
capabilities across the four dimensions in the 
technology resilience life cycle. The most mature 
organizations incorporate technology resilience 
into application and system architecture 
by design. In deployment and operations, 
resilient operations should consider not only 
operational contingencies but also the root 
cause of incidents that arise during business 
as usual to improve procedures, training, and 
technology solutions. Monitoring and validation 
involves reactive or backward-looking metrics 
at lower maturity levels. At higher maturity levels, 
organizations shift to proactive measures to look 

62

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023 
 
for early indicators of resilience issues and test 
responses and contingency plans for the most 
likely eventualities. In response and recovery, 
organizations with high technology resilience 
not only respond as incidents occur but they also 
continuously learn from their own operations, 
industry trends, and catastrophic events and 
then feed that back into technology design, 
operation, monitoring, and planning. 

Organizations should also assess past 
technology-related incidents to identify and 
uncover common contributing factors that can 
be addressed to increase technology resilience. 
Typically, this consists of selecting a broad set of 
recent incidents of varying duration and impact 
across business functions to evaluate. It can 
also include reviewing past incident-response 
logs, incident reports, and other documents 
to identify contributing factors, patterns, and 
insights that can shed light on causes behind 
the incidents. Meeting with engineers, product 
or system owners, release managers, and 
others involved in the incident and response can 
uncover what happened, what could have been 
done to prevent the incident, and initiatives that 
are already under way. 

Once completed, it’s then possible to identify 
and ultimately remediate common factors that 
led to these incidents, which may include the 
technology environment itself, the architecture 
of applications, interfaces between systems and 
third parties, and the way resilience was built 
into individual applications and systems. 

3.   Remediate gaps through cross-functional 
approach: Achieving technology resilience 
requires remediating gaps identified from the 
assessment of the organization’s technology and 
diagnostic of past incidents. In addition to directly 
remediating the gaps identified, organizations 
should take the following specific steps: 

Determine ownership and accountability of 
technology resiliency activities. Distributed 
systems can have multiple owners, and 
developers aren’t always incentivized 
to architect and design for resilience. 
Applications and systems must have clear 

ownership, developers need incentives with 
performance goals tied to the resilience 
of the applications they build, and third-
party contracts must include resilience 
requirements and clauses. The absence of 
clear system ownership and responsibility 
to remediate gaps will adversely affect the 
resilience of systems and business processes. 

Enhance governance toward resiliency levels. 
Oversight of resilience must be implemented from 
the executive level on down. The C-suite needs 
to communicate its intention and prioritization 
of resilience down through all levels of the 
organization with continuous and consistent 
messaging. Town halls, quarterly newsletters, 
and webinars are all potential avenues. Likewise, 
awards and other forms of monetary and 
nonmonetary incentives may be considered. 

Increase resilience of individual applications and 
application groups. The resilience of individual 
applications and systems also needs to be 
addressed and remediated. Those that have the 
highest number of incidents and support the 
most critical business processes need to be 
prioritized for remediation. 

Strengthen the hosting setup, whether on 
premises or on cloud. The underlying platforms on 
which applications reside also need to be designed 
and architected for resilience. Organizations 
should work to increase the resilience of their 
on-premises and cloud platforms through 
remediating known gaps and addressing 
contributing factors from past incidents. 

Work with third parties to increase the resilience 
of third-party platforms on which critical 
business processes and services depend. There 
could be incentives for third parties to build 
resilience into their systems, and contracts 
must have clear language on performance 
requirements for resilience. 

Implement regular testing, with a focus on 
automatic failover capabilities for large-scale 
environments and selective exercises for testing 
recovery from backups. Resilience is a continual 
journey, and systems must be regularly tested 

A technology survival guide for resilience

63

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and validated to ensure they meet resiliency 
requirements. Monthly failover testing of 
business-critical applications is essential both at 
the application and platform level. Failover tests 
should be designed to test not just the expected 
but also the unexpected, such as through hard 
shutdowns or introduction of capacity surges 
that mirror real scenarios. Where resilience 
is built in by design, applications should be 
randomly shut off in production to test whether 
inherent resilience is truly architected and built 
into the application or system. 

In the McKinsey survey, when asked what 
failover scenarios respondents planned or 
tested, 92 percent said they tested for a single 
data center failure and for nonphysical impact, 
while 52 percent said a dual data center failure, 
and 83 percent said physical impact (Exhibit 2). 

When asked, “Do you run unplanned failover 
testing?” (that is, randomly shut off systems and 
test the organization’s ability to respond/recover), 
54 percent said none, while 26 percent said most 
critical applications only, and 20 percent said they 
test for all applications (Exhibit 3).

The journey to technology resilience  
in three steps
With an understanding of the three levers to 
technology resilience, an organization can embark 
on its technology journey in three steps. 

Technology resilience diagnostic
Identify two to three critical business processes 
and map the underlying data sets, applications, and 
technology systems that enable the processes. 
Evaluate the resilience of each component of 
the value stream. This will lead to uncovering the 
technology resilience of the data, applications, and 
systems that underpin critical business processes 
along with risk-mitigating actions. 

Conduct an incident retrospective
Conduct a retrospective on recent technology-
related incidents to identify common contributing 
factors and develop remediation actions to 
decrease the incident rate and increase the 
resilience of the technology environment. Interview 
developers, release engineers, and others involved 
with the incidents to uncover contributing factors 
and what could have been done to prevent them. 
The result will provide a stronger perspective on

contributing factors that led to the incidents and 
actions that can be taken to decrease the incident 
rate and increase technology resilience. 

Achieving resilience is not a one-time activity; rather, 
it’s an ongoing process and capability that will take 
time to evolve into a solid defense mechanism. 

Develop a redundant technology capability
Design a resilient architecture for one or more 
components of the technology stack and a future-
state technology architecture to address the 
previous diagnostic and incident retrospective. 
These capabilities should include a transition and 
implementation plan and requirements for ongoing 
monitoring, maintenance, and validation. The 
result should be a resilient technology architecture, 
transition, and implementation plan along with 
monitoring and validation requirements. 

As with all types of protection, it’s not “you get what 
you pay for” but rather “you get what you prepare 
for.” It would be easy to throw money at all forms of 
resilience, but understanding what you possess and 
then having visibility and transparency into what 
you have will bring focus, allowing any organization 
to remain resilient and either stay up and running or 
get back to a steady state as soon as possible.

defects occur. No industry or company is a stranger 
to operational risk. These incidents carry a hefty 
price tag: according to the ORX global banking 
database, more than 65,000 loss events on average 
occurred from 2016 to 2021, with losses totaling 
close to $600 billion over the six-year period.1

losses. Moreover, the severity of the damage can 
vary widely, depending on the type of event, industry 
in which it occurs, and broader market volatility. The 
following data and discussion give a snapshot of 
what is at stake in operational-risk events. It’s far 
greater than the immediate damages reported in a 
headline (see sidebar, “Methodology”).

Direct financial losses don’t capture the full impact. 
Operational-risk events can color a company’s 
reputation among its customers and employees, 
prompting questions over whether the event reflects 
foundational issues. Regulators may increase 
their scrutiny, shifting their interaction model for a 
particular company or a broader industry.

Perhaps the most telling sign of these near- and 
long-term repercussions lies in the stock price. 
Shareholders take operational-risk events seriously: 
in the months after an event, equity losses are on 
average five times greater than direct financial 

Operational-risk events trigger 
persistent declines in share price
As news of operational-risk events hits the market, 
share price declines somewhat, in line with the actual 
fines, settlements, and monetary losses. But over 
time, total shareholder returns (TSR) continue to fall. 
Across our sample of nearly 500 operational-risk 
events at companies in North America and Europe, 
TSR declined by 2.7 percent in total returns compared 
with peers during the 120 days after the event. This is 
equivalent to $1.9 billion on average, or 3.7 times the 
average actual loss of $500 million (Exhibit 1).

In the eyes of shareholders, not all 
operational-risk events are created equal 
The decline in share price that follows an 
operational-risk event varies depending on the type 
of incident that caused it (Exhibit 2). The two most 
common subrisks in the data set are: 

1. 

Improper practices. The market reacts 
negatively but gradually to events linked to 
improper business or market practices. The data 
indicate that short-lived recovery can occur in 
the days after the event, but over the period of 
120 days, declines are nearly 2.9 percent versus 
comparable peers, or seven times the average 
actual losses from such events. 

2.  Suitability, fiduciary, and disclosure. Violations of 
suitability, disclosure, and fiduciary standards also 
trigger declines over time, but these occur faster. By 
fewer than 60 days after the event, average share 
price drop is 2.8 percent below peers’, approx- 
imately the level at which it remains at 120 days.

North American and European 
markets respond differently
The way companies communicate information about 
such events to investors may influence market 
response. Our analysis indicates that European 
markets tend to react faster and more strongly. 
Within three days, shareholder losses equal reported 
losses from the event itself; by 30 days, losses are 
five times reported losses. By 120 days, the European 
companies in our data set had seen a decline of more 
than 4 percent in their share price, equivalent to ten 
times direct losses.

The reaction of North American markets is only 
half as strong, and it’s more gradual. But as with 
European markets, TSR continues to drop over time, 
perhaps as more information emerges. Investors in 
both geographies seem to assume that the losses 
exceed the amounts reported, perhaps believing 
that operational-risk incidents signal more general 
mismanagement that may compromise the company’s 
ability to create value (Exhibit 3).

Markets punish financial-services firms 
more harshly for operational risks
Operational-risk events affect the share price of 
firms of all types, but shareholders punish financial 
institutions more strongly. By 120 days after event, 
financial firms see a decline of nearly 4 percent in 
TSR versus peers, while other firms see a decline  
of only 1 percent—equivalent to 14.0 times and  
0.9 times associated reported losses, respectively. 
This observation holds in both North America  
and Europe.

The data suggest that shareholders may read more 
into what an operational mishap says about future 
earnings potential for a financial institution. Our 
data don’t indicate whether the perception is due 

to differential conjecture about firm management, 
implications for future regulatory scrutiny, or 
something else (Exhibit 4).

The impact on TSR from operational- 
risk events is largest when markets  
are volatile
Our analysis indicates that when markets are 
volatile, operational-risk events trigger larger drops 
in the share price of affected companies compared 
with peers that have not had events. To analyze a 
statistically significant number of operational-risk 
events, we looked at loss events over five-year 
periods in the data set. In the 2005–10 period, the 
average drop in TSR (120 days after the event) for all

Methodology

To understand the effect of operational-
risk events on share price, we analyzed 
operational-risk events between 2006 and 
2020 at organizations from North America 
and Europe (including the United Kingdom), 
across sectors. Our analysis was similar 
to that undertaken by McKinsey in 2005,1 
which looked only at financial institutions.

All analysis is based on public data, 
including the financial statements of these 
organizations and their peers. We filtered an 
initial database of 19,010 operational-risk 
events sourced from the SAS Institute’s SAS 
OpRisk Global Data. We isolated a group of 
498 that met the following criteria: inflation-
adjusted losses were at least $50 million; all 
affected organizations are publicly traded 
European and North American companies 
and institutions; only events with end dates 
in or after 2006 were considered (as dated 
from their first appearance in a major news 
outlet such as the Wall Street Journal or 
Bloomberg News).

The 498 risk events examined included 
events occurring at companies in North 
America (332) and Europe including the 
United Kingdom (166). Both financial (287) 
and nonfinancial (211) companies were 
represented. Of these events, two sets 
of subrisks stood out: improper business 
or market practices (210 incidents) and 
suitability, disclosure, and fiduciary events 
(189). All other events were grouped in a 
third category which includes theft, fraud, 
and disasters (99).

Stock price and company-level data were 
sourced from the S&P Global database. 
Abnormal returns were calculated in  
two ways: how the affected firm compared 
with the broader market and how it 
performed against peers (adjusted by 
the Fama–French three-factor model, 
including market, size, and value premium). 
The top 2 percent of gainers over a  
160-day sampling window were excluded 
as outliers.

A final point is that two alternative 
methodologies for measuring impact were 
also explored, both widely used in academic 
research and industry analysis. The first 
alternative approach measures abnormal 
return for each company as the difference 
between actual and overall market return 
(instead of using the Fama–French three-
factor model). Accordingly, the impact from 
operational-risk events is defined as the 
average cumulative abnormal return over  
120 days from approximately 500 operational 
risk events in our sample. The second 
alternative approach estimates the impact as 
the average excess cumulative return of the 
affected companies relative to that of their 
respective industry peers over the same time 
window. The results and detectable patterns 
were much the same under the different 
calculation and measurement approaches.

events in the rolling five-year period was nearly  
7 percent versus only 1.5 percent during the 2010–15 
period. Over this same period, S&P 500 volatility 
dropped nearly 40 percent.2 In times of high market 
uncertainty, firms should be particularly aware that 
operational-risk losses can have a magnified effect 
on shareholder value (Exhibit 5).

What can leaders do?
The findings have several urgent implications for 
leaders as they think about the overall resilience of 
their institutions, how to minimize the risk of such events  
occurring, and how to respond when crises do hit.

The findings strongly suggest that broad market 
forces and industry dynamics can magnify adverse 
effects. Effective crisis and mitigation planning 
has to take account of these factors. Experience 
supports this view. In the not-so-distant past, 
especially before the financial crisis of 2008–09, 
many companies approached operational-risk 
measures from a regulatory perspective, with an 
economy of effort, if not formalistically. Incurring 
costs and paying fines for unforeseen breaches 
and events were accordingly counted as the 
cost of doing business. Amid crises, furthermore, 
communications were sometimes aimed at

minimizing true losses—an approach that risked a 
damaging cycle of upward revisions.

The present environment, however, is unforgiving of 
such approaches. An accelerated pace of change, 
especially in digitization and social media, magnifies 
the negative effects of missteps in the aftermath of 
crisis events. Leaders are consequently grappling 
with the long-term effects of operational-risk 
events, seeking crucially to avoid the dangers of 
underestimating their impact on market value.

The directional change in the response to 
operational risk has been from this formalistic, 

regulatory approach toward corporate resilience 
and the reduction of the most material risks. Part of 
this involves the development of robust monitoring 
and response capabilities, designed to help 
organizations understand their own position, that 
of their peers, and the broader market. In shaping 
their rapid-response capabilities, furthermore, 
organizations will need to manage stakeholders 
proactively. This includes developing an effective 
plan for communications, since the ways 
organizations communicate information to investors 
about operational-risk events have a bearing—
positive or negative—on the market’s response.

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023Rate reset presents 
banks with IRRBB 
challenge

By focusing on six key areas, banks can more accurately manage 
rising interest rates and credit spread risk across business lines, meet 
regulatory demands, and create competitive advantage.

Rising interest rates around the world can be 
helpful to banks, but they come with challenges—
especially after an extended period of low 
borrowing costs. Aside from the direct impacts of 
monetary tightening, which may have positive or 
negative effects, banks face increased uncertainty 
around customer behaviors in both their loan books 
and deposits. Amid heightened regulatory risk, 
leading institutions are now revisiting the impact 
of these changes across data, models, and risk 
management activities.

Fast changes in central bank interest rates can 
lead to significant shifts in customer behaviors and 
bank risk exposures. In the loan book, drawing and 
repayment patterns may change, and there can be 
significant disruptions in mortgage pipelines. There 
is a higher risk of deposit decay-rate instability, 
which can require increased use of decay and 
hazard models to fix repricing tenors.1 Meanwhile, 
a more intense competitive environment can 
cause individual players to see declines in liquidity 

coverage and gains in deposit beta—the percentage 
of rate change passed on to customers.

In Europe, many of these challenges are subject to 
regulatory oversight through the European Banking 
Authority’s (EBA) new guidelines for interest rate 
risk in the banking book (IRRBB), published in 
October 2022. The expanded framework motivates 
banks to balance risks against key metrics, 
including net interest income (NII) and economic 
value of equity (EVE), which represents the net value 
of assets and liabilities. It also provides rules and 
recommendations on how to calculate key metrics, 
for example, with respect to the modeling and 
composition of balance sheet exposures, yield curve 
scenarios, behavioral assumptions, and subrisk 
categories (Exhibit 1). To meet IRRBB obligations, 
many banks are now abandoning the lens of the 
past 15 years—predicated on “lower for longer”—
and taking action to manage the impacts of higher 
rates across the business.

IRRBB’s new definition of risk 
to net interest income
The current test for IRRBB supervisory outliers is 
focused on changes in banks’ EVE—the difference 
in the value of assets and liabilities before and after 
hypothetical rates shocks. Going forward, however, 
the EBA’s proposed test would equally assess the 
impact of shocks on NII. Methods for measuring NII 
risk are evolving. The new supervisory outlier test 
requires a calculation based on a static balance 
sheet, but many banks (around one in three) are 
starting to use the more realistic assumptions and 
responses to market scenarios represented by a 
dynamic balance sheet.2 Moreover, rising numbers 
of banks report that a combination of higher rates 
and the new methodology are causing them to 
breach the test limit.

McKinsey’s most recent Treasury Survey also 
reveals some potentially damaging approaches 
to measurement of delta NII, with the majority of 
respondents applying floors on deposit and mortgage 
rates. This has the effect of producing higher levels of 
variability when rates move up or down. A minority of 
banks apply floors on market rates.3

In calculating the impact of interest rate shocks, 
the EBA guidelines say banks should adopt an 
expanded definition of risk to NII that includes 
market value changes in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI) category (for example, revenues, 
expenses, gains and losses), a correction position 
on a bank’s common equity tier-1 (CET1) capital. Just 
56 percent of banks currently impose limits on OCI, 
according to McKinsey’s survey. In addition, banks 
should consider increases or declines in profit or 
losses and capital over a longer time horizon. This, 
in turn, impacts how they should treat and interpret 
behavioral models.

To understand how best to manage IRRBB 
exposure in the new regulatory environment, 
banks need to gauge trade-offs in the relationship 
between bank EVE and NII. The basic rule is that 
if a bank’s NII declines, it is less able to retain 

earnings. In a positive rate environment, an upward 
shock to interest rates yields a negative delta EVE 
and a positive delta NII. Therefore, a critical task 
is to ensure that behavioral models can impart the 
insights into deposits to minimize NII volatility while 
remaining delta EVE neutral. In practice, this means 
optimizing reinvestment and hedging activities. 
Ideally, then, it makes sense to agree on an optimal 
delta EVE/delta NII position.

McKinsey research shows that banks are taking a 
range of approaches to balancing delta EVE against 
delta NII in various rate scenarios. The differences 
are usually associated with variables that include 
currency mix, yield curves, behavioral assumptions, 
and pricing. However, the basic rule is that a bank’s 
ability to immunize NII across rate scenarios will be 
contingent on its ability to manage EVE, as well on 
as the modeling choices it makes.

A new approach to deposit 
modeling and hedging
The EBA guidelines provide clarifications and 
extensions for modeling, first relating to maximum 
tenors and then to the scope of relevant deposits, 
which have been expanded to include operational 
deposits by financial institutions. 

Best practices for deposits modeling and hedging 
include the following: 

 — Customer segmentation in line with regulatory 
classifications. Balances should be assigned 
to distinct segments. Behavioral and regulatory 
features can be used for segmentation, 
complemented by advanced analytics and 
expert judgment. 

 — Core balance modeling. Banks must determine 
their long-term stable balances, taking into 
consideration migration between current 
accounts, term deposits, and savings deposits. 

2 The static balance sheet assumption, a key component of the European Union–wide stress tests, means that the balance sheets of 
participating banks are assumed to remain constant over the stress test horizon in terms of total volume, maturity, and product mix.

 — Deposit volume modeling. Efforts should 

be made to measure the evolution of deposit 
volumes. Industry best practice is to use the 
age-period-cohort model, taking into account 
the survival rate and expected volume. 

subject to specific criteria, such as interest rate 
level, prepayment penalties, age of mortgage, 
and additional borrower background. They 
should adjust expectations to reflect likely 
shorter tenors. 

 — Deposit beta. This is defined as the sensitivity 
of client rates to changes in market rates or 
the pass-through rate. There is a trend toward 
regime-based deposit betas to better capture 
the variability of market rates being passed 
through to customers in different interest rate 
regimes. Calculation of deposit beta should 
inform hedging strategy. 

 — Hedging strategy. Risk profile of modeled 

liabilities can be covered by different hedging 
instruments. The hedging strategy can focus on 
economic value or net interest margin, or it can 
target the optimization of the risk-return profile. 
An increasing number of institutions are using 
stochastic models to test hedge ratios in the 
presence of convexity and optionality. 

An increasingly common approach is to apply 
advanced analytics to the modeling task, for 
example, by using machine learning to estimate 
classification probabilities and predict allocations as 
rates and regulatory treatments change. A random 
forest model, for example, creates multiple binominal 
regression-based decision trees and simultaneously 
selects variables. Often the analytics will point to 
previously unconsidered drivers, leading to higher-
than-expected prediction accuracy. 

The current rate environment also requires 
heightened attention to modeling and management 
of mortgages and other term loans. Acceptance 
rates may become more volatile due to changing 
prepayment behavior, as can loan life spans. 

Best practices on quantification, hedging, and pricing 
of prepayment risks are evolving. They include: 

 — Interest rate scenarios. Banks should model 
a range of scenarios and simulate potential 
prepayment behavior for each scenario. 

 — Hedging ratios and strategy. Banks should 

evaluate the value of mortgages under various 
rate scenarios and derive sensitivities to 
economic value and P&L. They should select 
hedging instruments reflecting fair value and 
P&L changes. 

 — Pricing. Institutions should adjust pricing 
based on analysis of maturities and 
prepayment behaviors. 

In a more volatile rate environment, pipeline risk 
increases, with acceptance rates tending to be less 
predictable as prices move between first lock and 
full drawing. In fixed-rate mortgages, meanwhile, 
prepayment rights can lead to significant reductions 
in repricing tenors. At the time of writing, average 
repricing tenors are well below the regulatory cap. 
Meanwhile, just a quarter of banks hedge pipeline 
risk, our most recent Treasury Survey shows.

There are related uncertainties around the quantum 
and timing of drawdowns. Again, some banks are 
tackling the challenge with advanced analytics, which 
they apply at each step in the process, from the initial 
lock, through client acceptance, and at full approval. 
Early indications are that use of supervised and 
unsupervised learning provides powerful insights into 
acceptance rates, contingent on the banks’ ability to 
marshal sufficient data across financial, behavioral, 
and macroeconomic dimensions. The analytics can 
also provide vital insights into potential hedging 
ratios and hedge timing.

 — Customer segmentation. Banks can divide the 
mortgage portfolio into customer segments 
through analysis of behavioral features. 

 — Prepayment behavior. Banks should quantify 
“constant” prepayments and prepayments 

Focusing on credit spread risk
The new IRRBB guidelines expand the perimeter for 
credit spread risk in the banking book (CSRBB) and 
set higher expectations for bank governance with 
respect to credit decisions. CSRRB is defined as a 

76

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023It is not always the case that credit 
spread volatility is directly correlated 
to credit rating, and higher-rated 
companies are often more volatile.

combination of two elements: changes in “market 
credit spread” and changes in “market liquidity 
spread,” representing the liquidity premium that 
sparks market appetite for investment and creates 
willing buyers and sellers.

There is still uncertainty regarding the scope of 
CSRBB. However, the guideline asks banks to 
consider all instruments that may be subject to 
credit spread risk, including off-balance-sheet 
items such as loan commitments. Assets at fair 
value should always be included, while changes in 
the institution’s own funding rate cannot be used 
to offset credit risk. Indeed, institutions should not 
exclude any instrument in the banking book from 
the perimeter of CSRBB ex ante, including assets, 
liabilities, derivatives, and other off-balance-
sheet items. Potential exclusion of instruments 
should be done only in the absence of sensitivity 
to credit spread risk and should be appropriately 
documented and justified (Exhibit 2).

It is not always the case that credit spread volatility 
is directly correlated to credit rating, and higher-
rated companies are often more volatile, McKinsey 
research shows. A key but sometimes ignored driver 
is debt tenor. To offset the risks associated with 
the above approaches, the EBA has introduced 
an idiosyncratic component to measures of credit 
spread risk in the banking book.

With banks starting to implement the CSRBB 
alongside IRRBB rules, some have adopted 
strategic change programs, allowing them to 

simulate CSRBB for the entire balance sheet, 
including issuances. Consequently, they can 
measure the full impact of changes in market 
liquidity and credit spread for both assets and 
liabilities. This helps them reflect a more dynamic 
view of the impact of changes to funding spreads 
in internal risk management frameworks and make 
economic capital calculations that go beyond the 
regulatory interpretation of the EBA guideline. 
Currently, just 28 percent of banks measure the 
risk of variation in their funding rates over time, 
McKinsey’s Treasury Survey shows.

Balancing the framework with  
six priorities
The EBA’s new standards for managing IRRBB  
are designed to help banks navigate the impacts  
of shifting rate environments on securities 
portfolios, pensions, and fair-value accounting. 
Meanwhile, the new supervisory outlier test 
threatens to capture many more banks than the 
existing method.

To tailor the operating model to the demands of 
IRRBB, we recommend an approach focused 
on governance, organization, and processes. 
As a first step, many banks review committee 
structures, and terms of reference, benchmarked 
against peers. A common action is to review 
organizational capabilities (size, skills, mandates) 
and responsibilities. For processes, some leading 
banks apply a twin strategic risk management 
and operational risk management lens, taking into

account escalation processes and remediation 
playbooks. Another common strategy is to apply 
dedicated KPIs to process efficiency, again 
ensuring alignment with peer groups.

Once a baseline is established, banks should seek 
out ways to manage changes in NII, including using 
advanced analytics and potentially switching to 
fair-value accounting for securities. It is increasingly 
common to fully integrate credit spreads into the 
steering process, with the focus on fair-value 
securities, while refining behavioral models to 

reflect higher levels of rate elasticity. It will also 
be imperative for banks to measure and manage 
operational deposits. All of this will best be achieved 
under a holistic governance framework that 
balances delta NII and EVE through six key priorities:

1.  Data integrity: ensuring completeness of data, 
exhaustive and correct data attribution, reliable 
data transfer, and central storage 

2.  Behavioral models: employing a full suite of 

behavioral models for deposits, mortgages, and

client behavior in different rate scenarios 

3.  Supervisory outlier test: allowing for rapid  
and frequent calculation of supervisory  
outlier testing for economic value and net 
interest income, including sensitivity and 
scenario analyses 

5.  Credit spread risk: allowing for calculation CSRBB 
for a wide range of balance sheet items, which can 
also be leverage for a broader management of 
spread risk, including funding-spread risk 

6.  Reporting: establishing a flexible and dynamic 

reporting framework that is easily accessible for 
multiple users and allows for drill downs 

4.  Business and hedging strategy: reviewing 

repricing profile of assets, liabilities, and off-
balance-sheet position, aligning average tenors, 
as well as considering application of derivatives 
and hedge accounting 

By paying close attention to management of these 
six areas, leading banks have shown that they can 
more accurately gauge the impact of rising interest 
rates and credit spread risk across key business 
lines, meet regulatory expectations, and create the 
impetus for competitive advantage.

Navigating economic 
uncertainty: New guidance 
for credit risk management

Amid persistent complexity, bank leadership teams need to urgently revisit their 
approaches to credit risk management.

by Kirtiman Pathak, Christophe Rougeaux, and Himanshu Singh

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023There is nothing new under the sun, as the  
old expression goes. But there sure are plenty  
of surprises. Rising interest rates, high inflation, 
low unemployment, supply chain concerns, 
elevated commodity prices, strong but evolving 
consumer balance sheets, low consumer 
sentiment, and febrile geopolitics are among 
factors leading to bouts of financial and economic 
volatility and deepening uncertainty for bank  
credit exposures. Indeed, the historical data  
used to support credit decisions often do not 
compute in the current context. Many banking 
leaders are quickly realizing that new approaches 
are required to navigate current conditions and to 
spot potential opportunities.

Faced with an array of unusual correlations, banks 
need to find ways to balance macro and micro risks, 
incorporating the diverse factors shaping the economy 
and understanding the implications for clients and 
portfolios. However, the current combination of 
events is unprecedented, and the challenge cannot be 
finessed by simple tweaks to model parameters. To 
both minimize risk and unlock pockets of value, more 
fundamental changes are required.

As discussed in a recent McKinsey article, 
organizations that thrive in uncertainty hone 
three kinds of edge: superior insights, clarity and 
commitment to specific actions, and speed of 
execution.1 In this article, we discuss five imperatives 
that may support edge sharpening across the 
following dimensions in credit risk management:

 — creating a range of scenarios to quickly model 

potential outcomes at a granular level 

 — revisiting risk limits and triggers to reflect 

changes in the business cycle 

 — creating new decisioning metrics 

 — prebaking menus of actions 

 — enabling faster and more flexible execution 

Decision makers that align their credit playbooks 
with these five imperatives may be better equipped 
to navigate uncertainty and develop a deeper 
understanding of the factors shaping credit quality 
over time.

Five capabilities to navigate uncertainty
In the past year, the global economy has faced 
multiple challenges, and orthodoxies that have 
evolved over recent decades have become 
more uncertain. To navigate these headwinds, 
banks require tools to help them understand 
the fundamental drivers of portfolio and obligor 
performance. Optimally, they should also reevaluate 
tactical and strategic tool kits and ensure that 
operating models enable rapid execution. Five steps 
can support actions to achieve these outcomes.

1. Cultivate the ability to quickly simulate  
impacts on portfolios and obligors across  
multiple scenarios
Increased uncertainty around future events, 
constantly shifting drivers, and an unusual 
combination of economic factors require banks  
to run scenarios that incorporate numerous 
external factors. The more factors and factor 
combinations that they can model, the easier it 
will be to identify and scope potential impacts on 
portfolios and obligors.

To support accurate modeling, scenarios must 
go beyond traditional approaches, many of which 
rely on a few standardized macroeconomic 
inputs. In a period of increased complexity, 
scenario generation requires more granular 
factors, incorporating both economic and broader 
uncertainties (for example, geopolitical risks, 
supply chain shocks). These should be combined 
with agile forecasting capabilities that enable 
rapid calculation of potential portfolio income and 
losses. Leading institutions enable faster action by 
generating new metrics every two weeks or every 
month, rather than every quarter, as was common 
in the past.

Navigating economic uncertainty: New guidance for credit risk management

To develop insights on the portfolio and obligor 
level based on scenarios, some banks are 
embracing new approaches to forward-looking 
credit assessment (Exhibit 1). To that end, they are 
exposing a range of transaction metrics to discrete 
combinations of granular macroeconomic drivers—
for example, food prices and utility bill inflation 
or rent increases and retail-customer interest 
charges. This approach enables banks to identify 
microsegments that may be vulnerable to specific 
scenarios or may prove more resilient. While the 
vulnerable microsegments present risks, the more 
resilient segments create potential opportunities 
for sustainable growth.

To effectively conduct these analyses, many banks 
are turning to highly automated implementation 
platforms that are capable of modeling and refining 
multiple scenarios and enabling analysis of impacts 
across portfolios and segments (macroeconomic 
or driver based). In many cases, the platforms 
incorporate a business-driver forecasting 
module, focusing on variables including scenario-
conditioned volumes, revenues, and expenses.

rates and dampened volatility. Current economic

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023The reasonable assumption is  
that through-the-cycle portfolio  
behavior may significantly change,  
so banks need to revisit these 
views of client performance in 
a higher rate environment.

consensus suggests these conditions may not 
return anytime soon. Indeed, the reasonable 
assumption is that the business cycle has shifted, 
and through-the-cycle portfolio behavior may 
significantly change. Banks therefore need 
to revisit through-the-cycle views of client 
performance in a higher rate environment, as well 
as verify that monitoring frameworks, triggers, 
and cascading mechanisms are still relevant and 
workable—from both a risk management and 
business growth perspective.

In assessing risk limits, it makes sense to proceed 
by business unit, product, industry, and geography. 
Limits for measures—including “one in X year” 
losses, the impact of stress scenarios, and the 
portfolio effects of downgrades or defaults—
should take into account shifting correlations and 
potential idiosyncratic events. This will lead to limit 
reanchoring that better reflects potential risks 
and outputs under different scenarios, as well as 
generating new estimates of capital needs.

Banks should also consider baseline- and stress-
loss outcomes, using the information to reevaluate 
triggers around risk appetite. There will be areas in 
which they want to tighten up on credit provision, 
but others where the risk/return trade-off may be 
more favorable in the next two to three years, based 
on the assumption that through-the-cycle portfolio 
behavior will be different than in the past.

At one bank with a diversified corporate portfolio, 
this exercise generated surprising results. Projected 
scenarios showed that the bank’s diversified 
portfolio had become relatively more concentrated 
in smaller sectors of the economy. This prompted 
decision makers to reevaluate sector concentration 
limits and refine individual obligor limits to better 
match the expected risk/return profile.

3. Develop forward-looking decisioning metrics
Effective analysis is predicated on having access 
to appropriate metrics, but current metrics are 
often backward looking; their ability to predict 
the future is tightly bound to relationships with 
historical trends. In a volatile world, in which many 
of those historical relationships are being upended, 
the predictive power of existing approaches is 
limited. In response, banks need to develop more 
forward-looking metrics that highlight risks and 
opportunities quickly enough to formulate a 
sensible strategy.

Creating a longer horizon of predictability is no 
simple task, but it can help to break performance 
down into groups of significant drivers and assess 
relevant trends both at portfolio and obligor  
levels. One institution built a performance matrix, 
plotting a range of business drivers (for example,  
a drop in demand, risks and receivables 
repayments, or dependency on energy) against 
potential impact intensities across industries 

Navigating economic uncertainty: New guidance for credit risk management

83

(Exhibit 2). It periodically reviewed the trends 
around drivers, helping calibrate the outlook for 
each industry under evolving scenarios. This was 
helpful in both managing risk and identifying 
pockets of opportunity.

For large individual obligors, it can make sense 
to go further, modeling revenues and costs under 
various scenarios and shocks to create cash flow 
curves and understand debt service coverage. 
This process can both highlight red flags and point 
to growth opportunities. Some banks are adding 
continuous-monitoring tools. These generate early-

warning signals based on financial and forward-
looking KPIs such as news flows (Exhibit 3), and 
can indicate declining credit quality as much as 
12 months in advance. Forward-looking indicators 
can also help risk managers define triggers for 
timely action at portfolio and obligor levels.

4. Use decision metric outputs to inform 
and ‘prebaked’ management levers
Accelerating change implies a higher bar for 
management preparedness. To adapt to deepening 
uncertainty, leadership teams can benefit from 
developing a set of “prebaked” actions that can be

implemented at short notice. Aligning in advance 
also allows for more creativity than decisions made 
at the spur of the moment, and will enable more 
clinical execution when required.

Through judicious monitoring of forward-looking 
metrics and indicators, bank leadership teams 
can take effective action across diverse aspects 
of credit oversight, from designing collections/
repossessions to adjusting portfolio allocation 
and refining customer engagement strategies—as 
well as timely planning for second-order impacts 
such as talent shortages. To ensure effective 
implementation, training at scale and across 
functions may be required; for example, upskilling 
of relationship managers and credit analysts  
on restructurings.

5. Enable agile decision making through cross-
functional perspectives and flatter hierarchies
Typical decision-making hierarchies are often 
insufficiently nimble to respond to a highly 
unpredictable environment. Banks need to 
rework their governance frameworks to enable 
much greater speed of decision making. While it 
can help to prebake actions and define initiation 
parameters, mobilization is also a challenge. To 
be effective, decisions should be operationalized 
through existing governance processes but at 
much faster speeds.

Speedy decision making requires efforts to  
ensure that at each forum there is 360-degree 
information flow, facilitated by cross-functional 
collaboration. In addition, there needs to be much 

Navigating economic uncertainty: New guidance for credit risk management

85

more real-time interaction between the risk 
function and the front office. The objective should 
not be absolute precision, but rather an increased 
ability to rapidly understand the direction of 
travel so that actions can be aligned. Similarly, 
to minimize bottlenecks, authority should be 
delegated within prescribed limits. Evaluating and 
adjusting authorities based on plausible scenarios 
will ensure they remain fit for purpose and help the 
organization react more rapidly.

identify and classify deposits and card-account 
spending in different categories. This can be 
aggregated at the borrower level to determine likely 
disposable income and potential shocks under 
various scenarios. Finally, a continuous-monitoring 
tool can centralize data from treasury transactions, 
news, forward-looking industry-specific indicators, 
and markets to generate segment- and obligor-level 
early-warning signals.

The route to transformation
As the global economy continues to surprise and 
the interest rate environment resets, banks should 
assess whether they have the capabilities and 
processes in place to create the three edges that 
will help them manage through uncertainty.

A good place to start is a structured evaluation of 
capabilities and processes, potentially through 
analysis across a single representative portfolio. 
This can help decision makers rapidly identify the 
capabilities that need to be enhanced across the 
board. Similarly, focusing on a few select, high-
impact portfolios can help illuminate pockets of 
value. Optimally, the exercise should be undertaken 
both from a risk function and business perspective, 
helping ensure that risks are managed and value 
realized across the institution.

A range of digital tools can provide additional 
support. For example, machine learning can help 

Amid persistent complexity, bank leadership 
teams need to urgently revisit their approaches to 
credit risk management. To navigate the changes 
required, there is an impetus to take action across 
the five dimensions discussed above, with analysis 
and responses optimized through highly automated 
implementation platforms.

As decision makers consider their options, a helpful 
first step will be to revisit current capabilities and 
resources and enhance data and forecasting 
capabilities—as well as to reconsider the 
assumptions that underlie them. At the very least, 
this will require refreshed tool libraries and more 
agile decision-making frameworks. Effectively 
implemented, these will help banks hone edges in 
credit insight, clarity, and execution, and help them 
marshal the inevitable risks and opportunities that 
define a new era of uncertainty.

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023At this moment, economies and societies are 
enduring several crises simultaneously. All have 
major humanitarian impact and potentially long-
lasting second- and third-order effects. The era is 
defined by the interplay of complex disruptions with 
disparate origins and long-term consequences. 
Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, 
record inflation and monetary tightening, supply 
disruptions, and increased geopolitical risk—all 
pose urgent questions of organizational resilience 
that cannot be addressed in isolation.

In a business environment subject to constant 
disruption, superior risk management has become 
a competitive advantage in all industries. Financial 
institutions are no exception. They are seeking 
to become more resilient. With scenario-based 
foresight, monitoring of early indicators, and crisis-
response capabilities, they can become capable of 
absorbing the shocks, pivoting, and accelerating into 
new realities. In this first of a series of articles on risk 
management in banks, we explore perspectives of 
chief risk officers (CROs) from some of the world’s 
leading banks on the evolving context and priorities.

What CROs are thinking
To discover the latest thinking of banks on risk and 
resilience, McKinsey conducted survey-based 
research in late 2021, engaging with more than  
30 CROs. We asked about the current and evolving 
banking environment, risk management practices, 
and forthcoming priorities. We quickly discovered 
that the great majority of CROs were already 
taking a long-term view when planning actions and 
identifying future themes. This perspective was only 
strengthened by the 2022 disruptions such as high 
inflation and geopolitical turmoil. Here is what the 
CROs said.

The banking environment 
Regarding the economy and business environment, 
respondents pointed out that banks were especially 
exposed to accelerating market dynamics, climate 
change, and cybercrime.

Most responding CROs (67 percent) cited pandemic 
effects as having had significant impact on 

employees and in the area of nonfinancial risk. Few, 
however, expected those effects to retain their force 
in three years’ time.

Climate change, on the other hand, is expected to 
grow in importance. Almost all respondents (92 
percent) assessed climate regulation as one of the 
five most important forces in the financial industry 
in the coming three years. Three in four (75 percent) 
stressed the significance of climate-transition 
risk—those financial and other risks arising from the 
transformation of global energy systems away from 
carbon-based fuels.

Cybercrime was consistently assessed as one of 
the top five risks by most executives (58 percent 
and increasing), now and in the coming three years. 
Other high-ranking risks included evolution of work 
practices and AI—its use and misuse. Forty-two 
percent of CROs ranked these risks in their top five 
risks in the coming three years.

Looking at the evolution of financial services, 
CROs identified accelerated digitization and the 
entry of nontraditional competitors, fintechs 
especially, as the top trends they are following. All 
respondents agreed that digital transformation 
is the most consequential initiative today; this will 
be true also in the coming three years, as these 
transformations bear significant operational and 
execution risks.

The entry of nontraditional competitors will 
significantly affect the financial sector, according 
to 75 percent of respondents; 67 percent see 
integration of fintech-vendor services into banks as 
a major trend in the coming years.

Interestingly, at the end of 2021, only one CRO 
identified the geopolitical environment as a risk 
of serious consequence for banks—a result not 
unlike the view most executives held in 2019 
toward the danger of a global pandemic occurring 
in 2019. It is likely, therefore, that the industry is 
exposed now to unanticipated risks that could 
strike in the future. Building a resilient model 
means increasing banks’ ability to respond 
effectively to unforeseen events.

More on the major risks banks face
We noted that the top three risks which most 
concerned the CROs in our survey were direct 
financial impact, harm to customers, and 
reputational damage (such as from conduct 
events). Each of these risks were ranked first by 
approximately 30 percent of responding CROs. 
They ranked the potential harm caused by these 
risks as greater than that from other risks such as 
legal or regulatory events.

A great majority of CROs stated that cyber, data, 
and technology risks (including related IT and third-
party risk) and climate risk will mostly underlie the 
adverse impact. Eighty percent of CROs, that is, 
identified these risks as rising in importance year 
after year and considered them among the top 
five risks. Credit risk also remained as one of the 
top risks for 70 percent of CROs, but was seen as 
decreasing in impact over time. Interestingly, other 
types of financial risks—for example, interest-rate 
risk, liquidity risk, and market or price risk—were 
rarely included among the top five risks.

On the topic of data, poor data quality was of 
greatest concern for 58 percent of respondents. 
The majority, that is, ranked this risk well above 
other data-related risks, such as unauthorized data 
access (28 percent) and lack of data availability. 
Half of respondents were also concerned that data 

issues will most hinder usage of advanced-analytics 
models. Regarding risks related to models, potential 
data issues ranked ahead of inaccurate models, 
model misuse, or privacy and security concerns.

Regarding time expenditure of CROs and board 
risk committees, the regulatory agenda ranked as 
the top time-consuming agenda item (40 percent) 
followed by emerging risks (15 percent), strategy 
for business growth or innovation (14 percent), and 
specific risk decisions (13 percent).

Most respondents (60 percent) expected the 
institutional share of staff dedicated to the 
regulatory agenda to grow in the coming three 
years, with additional regulatory resources needed 
most of all for climate risk, a number of nonfinancial 
risks (cyber, conduct), and credit risk.

How can risk functions lead 
the resilience effort?
Leading organizations, public and private, including 
financial institutions, are attempting to move 
to a resilient stance in relation to the disrupted 
environment. The drive for resilience is a turn away 
from the narrow crisis-response reflex and toward 
an agile state, where large, complex organizations 
protect against proximate risks, absorb shocks, 
and then pivot into the new realities. Decisions 

Resilience is a leadership orientation 
toward making choices in the crisis  
that set up organizations for growth in 
recovery periods.

the downturn. Resilience is a leadership orientation 
toward making choices in the crisis that set up 
organizations for growth in recovery periods. Risk 
must now become a function contributing to, if not 
leading, the resilience efforts of banks. 

CROs acknowledge that they need to spend more 
time considering “over the horizon risks.” This 
gap in thinking was brought into sharp focus by 
the heavy impact the COVID-19 pandemic and 
geopolitical tensions had on their institutions’ 
risk profiles—including second- and third-order 
effects—such as supply chain risk, inflation, and 
rising interest rates—which were not anticipated 
by most banking executives. 

Institutions were little prepared to address these 
highly consequential risks. The failure goes well 
beyond risk functions, however. Many organizations 
used forecasting to develop market strategies, but 
this approach failed to pick up major reality shifts 
in the recent past—from the financial crisis of the 
2000s to the pandemic to geopolitical realignments. 
Leading institutions are moving to scenario-based 
foresight to increase institutional resilience against 
over-the-horizon risks. The risk function can play an 
important role here in ensuring that the scenarios 
capture existing and expected risks, while aligning 
function priorities against scenarios.

In this area, risk leaders can focus on two 
important themes:

1.  Risk functions need to develop more 

sophisticated risk-identification processes. 
New risks emerge quickly in this dynamic 
environment, so they need to be discovered fast, 
along with their potential impact areas. 

2.  Investment is needed in foresight tools, such 
as “nowcasting,” which can feed nearly live 
quantitative data to help define scenarios and 
understand their impact on the main metrics 
of the bank. The risk and resilience function, 
modeling the strategic institutional stance, can 

develop planning cadences in which scenarios 
and action plans are continually refreshed.  

Where is risk management going?
CROs are seeing five main areas that are 
structurally evolving to shape risk management in 
the future. 

1. Evolution of the three-lines-of-defense model
Expectations on the role of the risk function are 
changing, and greater collaboration is expected 
across the lines of defense. The first line of defense, 
the owners of particular processes and operations, 
are seen by CROs as becoming more proficient 
in risk management and therefore handling more 
risk-taking decisions, such as those entailed in 
underwriting, collections, fraud management, and, 
in some cases, designing regulatory models. 

As a consequence, the three-lines-of-defense 
framework is evolving to refocus the risk function 
on typical second-line responsibilities, including 
appetite setting and monitoring, policy setting, 
the challenge role, and second-line controls and 
reporting. To be effective in its second-line role, the 
function should be stepping up its competence in 
new risk types arising in the domains of cyber and 
tech security as well as climate change.

Almost all respondents to our survey said that 
for financial risks, the delineation of roles and 
responsibilities between the first and second 
lines is clearly defined and well understood in 
their organization. The divisions are less clear for 
nonfinancial risks, however.

2. Digitization: New technology, tools, data,  
and an ‘old’ issue
The risk function can rely on new technologies, 
tools, and more data, even if some of these building 
blocks retain “old” issues. For example, new internal 
and external data and new technology, including 
AI, can improve the quality of risk monitoring and 
decision making, with early-warning systems and 
real-time controls. Here, the digital transformation, 

Risk and resilience priorities, as told by chief risk officers

91

 
highly valued by all responding CROs, is expected to 
improve the basic efficiency of the function. 

Many CROs believe, however, that they will continue 
to be affected by the old issue of poor data quality. 
As previously mentioned, more than half of 
respondents (58 percent) believe that advanced-
analytics applications will be negatively affected 
by data issues, especially poor data quality. The 
vulnerabilities can be addressed by exploring and 
developing new types of algorithms to improve the 
quality of risk decisions. The effort can be supported 
by an analytics center set up within the bank.

Reporting and monitoring, a core responsibility of 
the risk function, remains excruciatingly difficult, 
prone to manual intervention, and burdensome in 
most institutions, despite almost ten years of costly 
interventions after BCBS 239.1 Improvements are 
therefore sorely needed. Digital budgets have 
already grown significantly in recent years, however. 
Only 25 percent of CROs foresee an increase in the 
share of budget dedicated to digitizing activities. 
This means that needed improvements in reporting 
and monitoring will have to be achieved largely 
through improving risk-function efficiency.

Most CROs see existing digitization resources as 
the means to gain efficiency in traditional risk areas 
as well, especially credit risk, which will attract the 
bulk of investments, as credit decision making is 
digitized and the controls are automated.

3. Regulatory expectations
Prudential regulation is already having a significant 
impact on banks’ market positioning and risk agenda. 
These effects are expected to retain their strength (or 
grow in importance) in the next three years.

New regulatory areas, including refinements to 
existing regulation, continue to emerge. AMLA, 
the European Union’s new anti–money laundering 
authority, for example, will become operational 
in 2023. It is expected to pursue regulatory 
harmonization across borders, which will affect 

banks’ coordination and supervisory responsibilities. 
This move is in line with the general regulatory push 
for consistency in policies, tools, and risk decisions 
in complex institutions, along with the ability of those 
institutions to perform global oversight.

While retaining focus on existing regulation, CROs 
are closely watching the development of climate 
and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
regulation, which is set to evolve and tighten in the 
next three years. CROs believe that climate and 
ESG will soon be among the main regulatory themes 
affecting the financial-services industry. 

Banks have been prone to poor regulatory 
remediation processes. In response, risk 
functions at leading institutions are seeking 
to build best-in-class processes, specialized 
skills, and organizational models needed to lead 
regulatory projects. In particular, attention is 
being given to agile ways of working. Overall, 
early and proactive engagement with regulators is 
the most important means to achieve alignment  
of regulatory demands with compliance and 
control strategies. 

4. Market shifts and new risk priorities
Banks are coming under increased cost pressures 
as risk levels could rise in the short term. Low-cost 
market entrants, such as fintechs, are challenging 
business models. CROs are about evenly split in 
their expectations on the size of future risk budgets. 
Most of those who see a reduction in real spending 
are from banks that are leading in the digital 
transformation of the function. These institutions 
are driving cost reduction programs at the group 
level. Most CROs expect risk budgets will reflect 
shifting priorities and maturity in managing the 
different risks. For example, risk professionals have 
observed a 5 percent decrease in credit risk over 
the past two years; conversely, they expect certain 
risks to rise in importance, including model risk, 
climate risk, and technology-related risks. Such 
changes tend to affect the risk skill mix rather than 
the size of the function.

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 20235. Creating and demonstrating value as  
a risk function
Historically, the risk and compliance functions 
in banks have focused on defining frameworks 
and establishing standard risk processes 
and governance—such as those around risk 
identification and assessment, monitoring 
and reporting, and remediation. Now, leading 
organizations are starting to focus on the value that 
those functions can and should create. This helpful 
shift moves attention and resources from more 
bureaucratic, documentation-oriented exercises to 
execution and business outcomes. When properly 
carried through, the focus on value becomes 
a powerful lever for business simplification, 
helping to rationalize processes and controls, 
reduce unprofitable products and services, and 
consolidate risk assessments. The path ultimately 
supports better institutional performance, including 
fewer losses experienced and reduced capital 
requirements for potential large, idiosyncratic 
events. Successful institutions able to focus 
on positive outcomes are more productive and 
more responsive to all stakeholders—customers, 
investors, and regulators.  

CROs’ future priorities
CROs are preparing for the future by leading a 
number of long-term efforts simultaneously. They 
are seeking to deepen and accelerate the digital 
transformation of the function, to win the war for 
risk talent, and to build state-of-the art expertise 
in regulation, cybersecurity, analytics, and digital 
innovation. Rather than seeing fintechs and other 
new entrants as adversarial threats, for example, 

forward-looking risk leaders are embracing the 
new approaches. They are designing digital and 
lean transformations within the bank to become 
catalysts for innovation, possibly including 
partnering with fintechs. Those efforts are ongoing 
even as risk managers address more immediate 
macroeconomic and political disruptions.

Clearly, in this period of economic crisis and change, 
risk capabilities are needed more than ever. The 
needs grow in the areas of digital processes, 
with strong analytics and data control. Equal 
attention must be given to the “hard” components 
of these changes—analytics engines and data 
infrastructure—and to the “soft” ones as well—the 
upskilling of people.

The CROs of leading banks are increasingly seeing 
the risk function’s role as central to institutional 
strategy and resilience building. Progress toward 
this shift—to a holistic resilience function with a 
strategic role—has accelerated under the stress 
of simultaneous crises. Risk is able to anticipate 
evolving trends in the economic and regulatory 
environment and identify emerging threats. 
Foresight in traditional focus areas for banking as 
well as in newer topics such as ESG, cyber, and 
geopolitical changes creates potential first-mover 
advantages. Only by locating risk within institutional 
strategy will banking CEOs and CROs be able 
to exploit such valuable intelligence. In times of 
crisis, resilient organizations find the ways to make 
consequential moves early and accelerate into the 
new realities. As conditions improve, they can shift 
into growth faster than those they left behind.

risk efficiency

As global risks increase and economic uncertainty persists, the risk 
functions within the financial services industry must continue to 
evolve talent to ensure organizational resilience.

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023Chief risk officers (CROs) in the financial-services 
industry are taking a hard look at their resourcing 
levels. After years of adding personnel to improve 
controls of global, multidimensional, and emerging 
risks, CROs are now also being asked to help 
improve their institutions’ overall efficiency. This is a 
reasonable request and a tough one—especially in 
the context of recent inflationary pressures. On the 
other hand, CROs feel pressured by supervisors to 
increase their resources, both on the organizational 
and regulatory fronts. In any case, CROs must 
maintain the correct level of resources for proper 
risk management oversight in line with their 
fiduciary duties, but it can be difficult to determine 
the correct resource allocation across many types 
of risks, fragmented activities, and geographies.

To help CROs benchmark their resourcing levels 
against peers and learn where efficiencies might 
be found in their own organizations, McKinsey 
surveyed CROs at more than 30 large banks in 
Europe, North America, and Australia—more 
than half of them global, systemically important 
banks. We asked them about the resources for 
their second line of defense (LOD2) risk function 
at a granular level (based on approximately 80 risk 
and compliance management activities to ensure 
comparability and explainability) and the main 
drivers of their risk function’s evolution over the past 
few years (for example, organizational structure, 
offshoring, functional maturity, and the bank’s 
business model).

An analysis on a limited data sample indicates that 
adding more people does not necessarily lead to 
better risk management. Based on our research, 
risk efficiency and effectiveness are generally 
positively correlated. Moreover, in our experience, 
it is possible to reduce costs by 15 to 25 percent 
on a gross basis (with a portion being reinvested) 
while increasing risk effectiveness through a well-
structured risk transformation program.

Rightsizing the risk function
To rightsize the risk function, many CROs are 
mapping their risk resources by activity. But 
comparing risk functions with peers and identifying 

possible gaps is a difficult exercise. There is 
significant variation among banks about how they 
divide responsibilities between LOD1 and LOD2 (for 
example, in the credit underwriting, financial crime, 
or fraud processes), as well as between the different 
LOD2s (for instance, between risk, compliance, 
legal, and finance). To be relevant, comparisons 
need to be made at the activity level, as granularly 
as possible.

In our survey conducted in 2021, we focused on 
a metric known as risk full-time-employee (FTE) 
intensity, which is simply the number of FTEs in the 
risk function divided by the total number of FTEs at 
the bank. For more than 90 percent of the banks in 
our sample, risk FTE intensity was between 1.6 and 
3.5 percent, with a median of 2.6 percent, for a 
common standardized scope of core risk activities 
(excluding financial crime and compliance activities). 
Compared with a similar survey two years earlier, 
banks below the median tended to still build up 
their risk resources slightly, while banks above 
the median tended to streamline, thus converging 
toward the median. Looking forward, half of CROs 
expect to grow the number of risk FTEs over the 
next three years, while 20 percent anticipate a 
decrease of more than 10 percent.

The largest banks skew lower due to a slight 
downward correlation between scale and FTE 
intensity. These scale benefits helped reduce 
risk FTE intensity by 0.2 to 0.3 percent for a 
bank with 150,000 employees versus a bank 
with 50,000 employees. We found no obvious 
relation between FTE intensity and geographical 
footprint or business model at the bank level (for 
example, primarily wholesale versus primarily retail 
banking), although we observed a higher intensity 
of wholesale activities within universal banks 
(approximately 2 times higher).

Among the banks in our survey, substantial 
variations exist in risk FTE intensity across all risk 
functions due to factors such as LOD1 maturity, the 
maturity of the bank’s data management, systems 
and processes, the degree of supervisory scrutiny, 
and the history of risk events. Even so, the averages 
are helpful guideposts.

On the cost side, risk costs among the banks 
surveyed accounted for approximately 2.5 percent 
of operating expenditures. Large universal banks, 
especially with sizable corporate and investment 
banking, tend to have lower-cost-intensity ratios 
versus FTE ratios, driven by their higher use of near- 
and offshoring for risk FTEs as well as a lower ratio 
of average risk FTE cost versus front office average 
FTE cost.

Allotting resources for individual risks
Within the LOD2 risk function, credit risk 
management represents the bulk of the FTEs, with 
a median FTE intensity of 1.25 percent. We saw 
an average decrease of 4 to 5 percent of credit 
risk FTEs in the past two years, primarily in the 
credit underwriting area. That was largely due to 
continued automation of the underwriting process 
and reallocating more of these responsibilities to 
LOD1 (Exhibit 1).

We also found that market risk has an FTE intensity 
of, on average, 0.25 percent. This rose slightly  

from two years ago, particularly among banks 
that had the lowest FTE intensity in market risk. 
Regulatory activity, particularly the Fundamental 
Review of the Trading Book, helped lift this 
average. Likewise, operational risk (excluding 
compliance) also has an FTE intensity of 
0.25 percent, which has decreased over the 
past two years. Several banks have drastically 
streamlined their operational-risk functions by 
reallocating more responsibilities to the LOD1 (for 
example, monitoring and testing). Today fewer 
“generalist” operational-risk staff support the 
businesses, with more resources being allocated 
to building stronger LOD2 expertise on new 
nonfinancial risks (such as cyber, data, and IT risks).

The remaining risk FTEs are almost evenly split 
between model risk management, enterprise 
risk management, and other activities. Model 
risk management resources have been trending 
upward as many banks continue to build this 
function to implement regulations (for example, 
SR 11-7 in the United States) and expand the types 
of models being overseen, from regulatory capital

models to underwriting models, market pricing 
models, compliance models, and climate risk 
models, among others.

This upward trend in risk management resources 
is set to continue as the types of models requiring 
validation continue to grow with the introduction of 
the Prudential Regulatory Authority CP6/22 in the 
United Kingdom in June 2022. While many banks 
have built climate risk teams, by and large these are 
small (less than 15 FTEs in most cases) and serve 
mostly as a coordinating function. Other established 
teams conduct climate stress tests and incorporate 
climate risk into existing risk frameworks, processes, 
and models.

Three organizational levers to  
reshape risk for better efficiency  
and effectiveness
CROs can use these survey results to benchmark 
against peers as they consider different ways to 
reshape their risk functions. We learned in our 
survey work that three organizational levers are of 
particular interest: refocusing LOD2 responsibilities, 
balancing resources between individual businesses 
and geographies versus cross-business and global 
teams, and near- and offshoring.

First, there is an ongoing trend to refocus the 
risk function on traditional LOD2 responsibilities, 
including appetite setting and monitoring, policy 
setting, the challenge role, and second-line controls 
and reporting. Generally, LOD2 also needs to 

step up competence in new risk types, such as 
those arising in the domains of cyber and tech 
security as well as climate change. Meanwhile, 
LOD1, the owners of particular processes and 
operations, needs to become more proficient in 
risk management and handling more risk-taking 
decisions, such as those entailed in underwriting, 
exceptions management, remediation, collections, 
know-your-customer (KYC) and anti–money 
laundering (AML) and sanctions transaction 
monitoring, fraud management, and, in some cases, 
developing regulatory models.

Another choice CROs face with potentially 
important implications for their function’s 
efficiency is how much to dedicate resources to 
support and supervise individual businesses and 
geographies versus teams with a global or cross-
business mission (for example, in transversal risk 
teams or in shared services centers). This creates 
opportunities to mutualize tools and expertise, 
standardize processes and practices across the 
banks, facilitating risk management (for example, 
through consolidation of data at the bank level). The 
approaches to this issue are wide ranging. Some 
banks in our survey devote less than 10 percent of 
their risk resources to transversal risk teams and 
shared service centers, while others allocate more 
than 50 percent (Exhibit 2).

Among the activities typically managed globally 
are model risk management and model validation, 
liquidity risk management, enterprise risk 
management (ERM) activities such as stress testing

and regulatory management, and risk modeling/
analytics. Market risk is usually managed globally 
since it is primarily related to capital markets and 
Treasury services. Meanwhile, data management, 
reporting, and LOD2 controls are all good 
candidates for shared service centers.

On the other hand, credit risk management,  
and in particular underwriting and portfolio 
management, is typically managed through 
specific businesses or geographies. In these 
cases, being close to originators, clients, and 
products is unmistakably valuable.

Last, there is the question of near- and offshoring, 
though in reality most banks don’t make much 
use of either. Less than one-third of the banks in 
our sample reported having more than 10 percent 

of their risk FTEs near- or offshored. These are 
typically the largest, most international banks with 
top corporate and institutional banking operations 
and a significant share of staff in high-cost locations 
(for example, Hong Kong, London, New York, Paris, 
Singapore, and Zurich). Only a limited number of 
other banks are considering ramping up near- and 
offshoring capacity.

Among the group of banks with 10 percent or more 
of their risk FTEs near- and offshored, the median 
allocation is 33 percent. Two strategies dominate. 
One is to offshore only the parts of processes that 
require the most manual work (for instance, data 
collection for modeling, back testing of models, 
and reporting), with FTEs reporting to onshore 
managers. This approach typically limits the 
maximum offshoring level to around 30 percent 

98

McKinsey on Risk & Resilience Number 14, May 2023of risk FTEs. Alternatively, some banks choose to 
near- and offshore full processes (for example, 
full-modeling life cycle, counterparty rating, or 
the onboarding process), with managers sitting 
alongside those operations. This approach permits 
a higher level of offshoring.

The risk functions with the highest share of 
near- and offshore FTEs are operational risk (up 
to 58 percent) and ERM (up to 41 percent). The 
remaining functions (for example, credit risk and 
market risk) allocate, on average, 20 percent of their 
FTEs to near- and offshore locations. No obvious 
relation exists between the proportion of risk 
FTEs in near- and offshore locations and FTE risk 
intensity—although near- and offshoring obviously 
help mitigate costs for banks in major financial hubs.

Building an efficient and effective  
risk function
Based on our research, risk efficiency and 
effectiveness are positively correlated. Once the 
organizational-design choices are made, the best-
performing banks share several traits:

 — A strong risk culture where LOD1 responsibilities 
are clearly defined and both LOD1 and LOD2 
have the capabilities to execute on their 
responsibilities. This allows the risk function to 
focus on its LOD2 role instead of compensating 
for LOD1 shortcomings. 

 — A best-in-class credit underwriting process, 
with front-to-back workflow and digital 
straight-through processing for private 
individuals and small and medium-size 
enterprises. For corporate-credit underwriting, 
the process should incorporate credit 
risk scoring models that are streamlined, 
standardized, and digitally enabled. 

 — Enhanced digital-monitoring capabilities using 
counterparty-level credit monitoring tools (for 
example, anticipatory action early-warning 
system), automated counterparty ratings, and 
automated portfolio stress testing. 

 — Risk reporting that is automated and 

managed across business units using demand 
management and modern data architecture. 
General risk users are supported by self-service 
risk reporting that is relevant, automated, 
and based on timely, trusted data. For more 
advanced information users, flexible query 
capabilities and what-if forecasting capabilities 
are available. 

 — Improved financial-crime processes, such 
as streamlined KYC tools that use dynamic 
checklists of standards and requirements, and 
advanced analytics to AML and fraud systems 
to reduce false-positive rates to as low as 50 to 
60 percent. 

 — A front-to-back market, counterparty credit 

risk, and liquidity risk-aligned architecture and 
models that support data quality (such as risk 
systems and front-office systems using the 
same data or even integrated data) and that also 
reduce discrepancies and manual adjustments 
and checks required in LOD2. 

 — Risk organization and governance designed 
for agile decision making (such as reduced 
organizational complexity, consolidated 
teams with similar activities, and zero-based 
governance meetings) and rationalized  
risk policies. 

 — A performance management in place, with 
dashboards of metrics for risk efficiency 
and effectiveness monitored over time and 
compared across sites and regions, which 
facilitates the sharing of tools and best 
practices. 

 — End-to-end strategy for model development 

and validation, supported by a common model 
inventory and streamlined process, automation 
tools, and document repositories across LOD1 
and LOD2. 

The next frontier in risk efficiency

99

 
Many CROs are moving to a phase more focused 
on improving efficiency now that their risk 
functions have been established. The good  
news is that once a bank’s risk function reaches  
a certain level of maturity, adding more 
FTEs doesn’t necessarily lead to better risk 
management. While the risk appetite and 
circumstances of each institution vary, many 
CROs are struggling to control costs due to the 
increasing complexity of risks and regulations, 
compounded by sky-high inflation. In our 

experience, it is possible to reduce costs by  
15 to 25 percent on a gross basis, while increasing 
risk effectiveness through a well-structured risk 
transformation program. Leading firms typically 
reinvest part of these savings to continue to build 
and reinforce their risk functions.

An understanding of the suite of tools available 
to CROs, including benchmarks, modeling, and 
advanced analytics, allows for increased efficiency 
and effectiveness within their risk organizations.
