AI is already being used to further all 17 SDGs—from the goal of eliminating poverty to establishing 
sustainable cities and communities and providing quality education for all—and generative AI has 
opened new possibilities. As we look to the future, we see exciting potential for acceleration, with new 
tools and platforms putting ever-greater power in the hands of social entrepreneurs, public sector 
innovators, and private sector players to create effective solutions. But that power also brings with it 
the need to assure it is harnessed in trusted and responsible ways and that risks are monitored and 
managed actively to avoid unintended harms. 

Six years ago, it was becoming clear that AI could play a major role globally in promoting not just 
productivity and economic growth but also social good. In a 2018 report, we outlined how AI 
capabilities, from natural language processing to sound recognition and tracking, could be used in 
about 170 use cases to benefit society1—to promote equality and inclusion, improve crisis response, 
protect the environment, and deliver impact in many more ways.2

Today’s AI R&D is not just confirming our initial assessments but showing promise for further gains in 
the future. A series of improvements in AI techniques and progress on key enablers have substantially 
expanded the universe of problems that AI may be able to address. Much of this progress is centered 
on generative AI, which is enabling natural language interfaces; rapid language translation; synthesis 
of vast document repositories; creation of stories in text, images, and video; and much more.3

In this report, we take another look at how AI can become a key part of solutions to benefit people 
and the planet—and how it already has. One way to assess this is by mapping innovations and impact 
to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs (see sidebar “Methodology,” found at the end of 
the report). The SDGs comprise 17 goals and 169 targets that aim to improve lives around the world 
and protect the planet. But the UN’s 2023 update on progress toward the SDGs indicates the world 
is on track to meet only 15 percent of SDG targets.4 In real terms, this means that 2.2 billion people 
lack access to safe water and hygiene, and 3.5 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation5; 
roughly 3.3 billion people live in environments that are highly vulnerable to climate change6; and about 
750 million people are facing hunger.7

Below, we illustrate the potential of AI to catalyze progress on these pressing social issues, and we 
highlight the challenges in the domains of data quality and governance, as well as access to AI talent 
(particularly for not-for-profits), that are hindering AI from scaling. We then outline some actions that 
stakeholders—including governments, foundations, universities, and businesses—could take to 
overcome these challenges. While the opportunities have associated risks, such as embedded biases 
and data privacy and security threats, thoughtful action could accelerate the deployment of AI-based 
solutions to advance progress on the SDGs and improve lives across the globe.

How AI can accelerate 
progress toward reaching 
all of the SDGs

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetAI is not a magic bullet, and many risks need to be managed to harness its potential (see sidebar 
“Managing the risks of adopting AI”). But the universe of problems that AI can address is broad. 

Current applications of AI are applicable to all the SDGs, including modeling proteins, screening 
drugs, designing vaccines, targeting aid and public services, solving supply chain problems such as 
route optimization for last mile delivery of food in remote geographies, forecasting the long-term 
impacts of climate change or giving early warning for natural disasters, and bringing expertise to 
frontline aid workers. 

Additionally, adoption of generative AI could significantly increase and democratize access to 
new capabilities. AI tools now allow remote users to complete tasks that once required specific 
expertise, such as language translation, fact checking, identification of human or plant diseases, 
and identification of harmful online content. In a recent survey of more than 4,000 not-for-profits 
conducted by Google for Nonprofits, 75 percent of respondents said that generative AI had the 
potential to transform their marketing efforts by enhancing their translation and fact-checking 
capabilities.8 

The experts we interviewed noted that AI could address or help solve social or environmental 
challenges in two circumstances: 1) when the AI solution could solve problems that bottleneck other 
efforts in the field—for example, a solution for water leakage in residential pipes requires predictions 
about the likelihood of leaks based on analysis of data such as pipe age and location; and 2) when 
data required for the model to work is (or will soon be) available and accessible.

To map the breadth of AI’s applicability, we have developed a database of AI use cases, each of 
which highlights a type of meaningful problem whose solution could be enabled by one or more AI 
capabilities. At the time of our 2018 report, this database contained about 170 high-potential use 
cases. It now contains about 600—more than a threefold increase. This number is growing as more 
innovative uses come to light, as social impact leaders continue to experiment boldly, and as AI tools 
become more accessible and easier to use. 

The number of real-life AI deployments has also increased significantly over the past six years. In 
2018, only a small fraction of the about 170 use cases had been deployed. Today, about 490 of the 
600 use cases, or more than 80 percent, have been implemented in at least one instance (Exhibit 1).9

Adoption of generative AI could 
significantly increase and 
democratize access to new capabilities. 
AI tools now allow remote users to 
complete tasks that once required 
specific expertise.

Note: Our library of 600 use cases and our analysis of deployments are based on publicly available data, are not comprehensive, and will continue to evolve; this 
library is a starting point and should thus not be treated as exhaustive. Many AI use cases are relevant for more than one SDG, which means that successful 
deployments of these use cases can spur progress on multiple fronts. Additional research in 2023 led to the discovery of 13 use cases piloted in 2018 that were 
not accounted for in our 2018 report.

SDG goals: Good Health and Well-Being (SDG 3), Quality Education (SDG 4), Affordable and Clean 
Energy (SDG 7), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), and Climate Action (SDG 13). In fact, 
60 percent of not-for-profit AI for social good deployments were in these areas. Relative to their 
perceived AI potential, the goals for Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Life on Land (SDG 15), and Peace, Justice, 
and Strong Institutions (SDG 16) have many use case deployments, whereas Quality Education 
(SDG 4), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), and Climate Action (SDG 13) have fewer (Exhibit 2). 
We excluded Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure 
(SDG 9); and Partnerships for Goals (SDG 17) from the analysis of not-for-profit deployment, 
foundation grants, and private capital, because most projects can be tagged to these areas given 
their broad applicability.10

01002003004000102030AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetAdditionally, several SDGs that are behind on progress have relatively untapped AI potential. 
Consider the following examples: 

 — No Poverty (SDG 1): machine learning could be used to direct cash aid to those most in need or 

provide alternative credit scores to financially excluded individuals.

 — Zero Hunger (SDG 2): AI could be used to help develop new crops, better select crop regions to 

minimize crop risks, and provide early warning for nutrition crises.

 — Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions (SDG 16): machine learning could be used to detect and 

curb the spread of misinformation, provide access to information that enables advocacy for policy 
change, and improve measurement of specific policy interventions.

Below, we explore potential and existing deployments in three of the SDGs with the most widely 
recognized potential: Good Health and Well-Being (SDG 3), Quality Education (SDG 4), and Climate 
Action (SDG 13). We also explore two SDGs where AI does not have widely recognized potential but 
has had an impact in select areas: No Poverty (SDG 1) and Zero Hunger (SDG 2).

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetManaging the risks of adopting AI 

Risks are inherent to the use of AI. With generative AI (gen AI), risks include inaccurate outputs, 
biases embedded in the underlying training data, the potential for large-scale misinformation, and 
malicious influence on politics and personal well-being.1 As we have noted in multiple recent articles,2 
AI tools and techniques can be misused, even if they were originally designed for social good. 

Respondents to our survey of about 60 experts identified the top risks as impaired fairness, 
malicious use, and privacy and security concerns, followed by explainability (exhibit).3 Respondents 
from not-for-profits expressed relatively more concern about misinformation, talent issues such as 
job displacement, and effects of AI on economic stability compared with their counterparts at for-
profits, who were more often concerned with intellectual property infringement.

Algorithmic systems can inherit biases from their creators or from the data sets on 
which they are trained. When these algorithms are deployed in decision-making capabilities, these 
biases can reinforce preexisting prejudices and social inequalities, with potentially negative impacts 
on marginalized communities. One organization, Data Science for Social Good, builds bias detection 
tools that allow developers to audit data science systems for bias and equity.4 

Malicious use. Malicious use includes creating and disseminating false information or fake content, 
scams, phishing attempts, hate speech, and activities that harm individuals and national security. 
A 2022 UN report found that misinformation had been used to incite hatred against marginalized 
groups and to prevent civilians from finding humanitarian corridors during conflicts, such as the one 
in Ukraine.5 According to a recent report by the World Economic Forum, “growing misinformation and 
disinformation could further increase vaccine hesitancy, which has already led to the re-emergence 
of locally eradicated diseases.”6 The Global Disinformation Index uses models based on large 
language models (LLMs) to detect disinformation with the goal of tracking news sites supported by 
hostile states.7 Similarly, Full Fact is an independent fact checking organization that deploys a range 
of AI and machine learning methodologies to detect and curb the proliferation of misinformation 
across the evolving landscape of information-spreading platforms. 

Data privacy and security threats. Many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals use cases require 
access to health or financial data of vulnerable populations. While organizations are well aware 
of the harm that could result from breaches in their data systems, many social enterprises have 
resource constraints that may limit their ability to use the latest cybersecurity capabilities. Several 
organizations have developed data privacy guidelines, tool lists, and custom security frameworks for 
not-for-profits with limited resources.8

Performance and explainability. Many AI solutions employ complex algorithms that can make it 
difficult to identify the data or logic used to arrive at a decision. This is particularly relevant for gen 
AI solutions, which may provide inaccurate or toxic answers. Explainable AI models have several 
advantages for not-for-profits: they may make it easier to verify the correctness and fairness of 
results, to assign credit to data providers, and to assign accountability for model outcomes. The 
Allen Institute for AI recently released a platform for comparing large text data sets to measure the 
prevalence of toxic, low-quality, duplicate, or personally identifiable information used to train various 
LLMs.9

To mitigate the risks of AI, organizations must first understand and prioritize the risks they are most 
likely to face, both from inbound AI threats such as disinformation and from developing and deploying 
their AI solutions. While risks such as data privacy may be addressed through traditional software 
tools, emerging risks, such as bias in systems driven by LLMs, may require the development of new 
monitoring systems and guardrails.

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetExisting deployments related to SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being 
SDG 3 aims to promote well-being and ensure people live healthy lives.11 Specific targets for this SDG 
include reducing maternal mortality; fighting communicable diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, 
and malaria; and establishing universal access to sexual and reproductive care, family planning, and 
education. 

AI is now well integrated into many medical research pipelines. Key AI applications in this area include 
protein modeling, genome sequencing, computerized tomography (CT) analysis, vision support, 
and vaccine design. Health is relatively accessible for AI work compared with many SDGs: the field 
is technology-forward, data availability is high (relative to other SDGs), and health outcomes are 
frequently measurable. Yet major opportunities remain to support SDG 3 targets that have received 
less attention, such as treating neglected communicable diseases and preventing substance abuse.

Sample use case: Addressing maternal and newborn health in Kenya. Jacaranda Health provides 
AI-enabled solutions that improve the quality of care for women with the goal of reducing the number 
of maternal deaths in Kenya. For example, PROMPTS is an SMS exchange that sends personalized 
messages to women, empowering them to seek care. An accompanying free digital healthcare 
platform uses natural language processing to categorize user questions in real time and connects 
those who need urgent care with a help desk agent. More than two million new and expectant 
mothers have enrolled with PROMPTS. Mothers who use the services are 20 percent more likely to 
attend more than four prenatal visits; women who adopt the service are also twice as likely to use 
postpartum family planning services as women who do not.12 Jacaranda Health shares feedback from 
PROMPTS users with governments and facilities to improve their services.13

Sample use case: Addressing maternal and newborn health in India. More than 1.3 million women 
in India have died in pregnancy or childbirth over the past two decades, mostly from preventable 
causes.14 ARMMAN was founded in 2008 to address systematic problems that prevent at-risk 
women from accessing care.15 The organization developed numerous interventions, including 
mMitra, an automated voice messaging system that delivers key information on preventive care. 
These messages have a high correlation with positive health outcomes, such as improved rates of 
taking iron supplements and better knowledge of family planning. However, 40 percent of women 
drop out of the program before giving birth.16 ARMMAN has resources to call some women and 
encourage them to stay in the program. The organization partnered with Google Research India to 
develop an AI-based prediction model for this intervention that selects women to receive service 
calls. The solution is a resource optimization model based on a restless multi-armed bandit approach 
to optimize resource allocation in a changing world. In a randomized controlled trial, dropout rates 
were 32 percent lower for women called according to the algorithm than women called using a round 
robin control group method.17 Using mMitra, ARMMAN has reached roughly 3.6 million women in nine 
states, many of whom would likely have dropped out without the AI-targeted intervention. ARMMAN 
has now developed a similar AI model for use with Kilkari, a voice technology program that brings 
time-sensitive care information to families.18

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetSample use case: Predicting the structure of proteins to aid drug discovery. DeepMind developed 
AlphaFold 2 in 2020 and AlphaFold 3 in 2024 to tackle a challenge that had plagued scientists 
for more than 50 years: the protein-folding problem. This problem involves three related puzzles, 
as defined by a National Library of Medicine paper: What is the folding code? What is the folding 
mechanism? And can we predict the native structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence?19 
AlphaFold2 is an attention-based deep learning system that predicts protein structures with a 
higher degree of accuracy than was previously possible. The DeepMind team released a database 
of more than 200 million protein structure predictions that is now widely used in structural biology 
research.20 A million researchers have accessed the protein structure database since its launch, 
using the predictions to solve real-world problems, including developing treatments for neglected 
diseases and fighting antibiotic resistance.21 AlphaFold 3 extends beyond proteins to include a wide 
range of biomolecules impacting life sciences and medical research, agriculture, materials sciences, 
and more.

Existing deployments related to SDG 4: Quality Education 
SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning 
opportunities.22 Targets include establishing free primary and secondary education, ensuring equal 
access to quality preprimary education, and achieving universal literacy and numeracy. 

One in 20 school-age 
children from low-
income countries 
has internet access at 
home, while nearly 
nine in ten from high-
income countries do.

AI algorithms are already being used in this space, such as predictive 
tools that help identify a student’s likelihood of completing high school 
or dropping out and that enable at-risk students to get early intervention 
and support.23 AI can be used to create more-inclusive educational 
platforms for young children, teenagers, adults, and people with 
disabilities; increase student enrollment; and formulate lesson plans 
for teachers—including creating materials tailored to students’ unique 
development areas and interests. 

Yet implementation has proved challenging, partly because of limited 
infrastructure—including internet access and data records—in 
developing countries. Roughly one in 20 school-age children from low-
income countries has internet access at home, while nearly nine in ten 
from high-income countries do.24 Parents are unable to engage with 
schools using digital platforms due to factors such as digital literacy and 
internet access, so use cases that focus on parent engagement are not 
yet an option.

Sample use case: Enabling people who are nonverbal or experiencing learning disabilities to 
communicate. Livox uses intelligent algorithms and machine learning to adapt content for students 
with a variety of disabilities, including verbal, motor, cognitive, and visual.25 The Livox interface adapts 
to the student’s needs, and its software tracks improvements in visual, auditory, cognitive, and 
behavioral function, making it easier for teachers to monitor students’ progress. More than 25,000 
people with disabilities have used this service, which is available in 25 languages.

that works to educate girls in India’s rural and educationally underresourced areas. The organization 
uses a machine learning model to reduce the operational cost of locating girls who are not attending 
school. Before developing this model, Educate Girls staff members had to travel from village to 
village to gather the required data, which they would then manually compile and analyze to identify 
areas where their services could have the most impact. The machine learning model uses census 
data, which is manually cleaned and updated where necessary, and district-level out-of-school data 
to recommend target areas, allowing Educate Girls staff to reach a greater number of prospective 
students faster and target interventions more accurately.26 Educate Girls aims to enroll 1.6 million 
girls—or 40 percent of the population of out-of-school girls—into grades one through ten.27

Existing deployments related to SDG 13: Climate Action 
SDG 13 focuses on combating climate change and its impacts, including strengthening resilience and 
adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters and integrating climate change measures into policies 
and planning.28 

AI can be used to analyze large climate data sets and model the impact of specific variables, improve 
the yield of agriculture, and reduce emissions from transportation and industrial processes, to name 
a few applications. Not-for-profit deployments are lower than perceived potential for this SDG. In the 
past few years, AI has been used to provide detailed climate information to improve climate change 
education and awareness, and to track emissions and improve the sustainability of operations 
across industries. It has also been used to strengthen resilience efforts through the creation of early-
warning systems, forecasts for natural disasters, and up-to-date information for disaster relief. 

Sample use case: Conserving forests by stopping illegal deforestation. Global Forest Watch (GFW) 
assesses forest conditions and monitors destruction using satellites, computer vision, and deep 
learning. Governments, civil society organizations, and companies can use this data to make informed 
decisions about sustainable sourcing and conservation. For example, Friends of the Earth Nigeria, a 
civil society organization, used GFW’s forest cover and land concession data to monitor deforestation 
and corporate land acquisition. This evidence was crucial in informing policy making for the 
government of Nigeria, which resulted in nearly 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) of land being given 
back to affected communities (a result that also benefits SDG 15: Life on Land).29

Sample use case: Improving flood forecasting. Google provides actionable flood forecasts to 
governments, local aid organizations, and people at risk by combining an AI model that forecasts the 
amount of water flowing in a river with another model that predicts which areas will be affected and 
how severely.30 The Flood Hub offers flood forecasts up to seven days in advance of a risk, as well as 
providing real-time alerts. Flood Hub currently predicts riverine flooding and helps protect livelihoods 
in more than 80 countries up to seven days in advance, including in data-scarce and vulnerable 
regions.31 Between October and December 2023, Google provided the International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC) with inundation risk maps and daily flood forecasts in 20 locations suffering 
from riverine flooding made worse due to the El Niño effect in Somalia. This information enabled 
the ICRC to target its humanitarian efforts toward key activities such as publicizing risks and 
floodproofing facilities.32

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetExisting deployments related to SDG 1: No Poverty
Even for SDGs with a lower perceived potential for AI and few deployments, there are successful 
impact initiatives that can be scaled elsewhere. SDG 1, which aims to end poverty in all its forms 
globally, is one such example.33 Targets for this SDG include eradicating extreme poverty; 
implementing social protection systems; and ensuring equal rights to ownership, basic services, 
technology, and economic resources. Making progress on this SDG requires both capital and 
the political will to provide social protection and distribute resources; AI has helped improve the 
efficiency of existing distribution systems.

Sample use case: Distributing aid during the COVID-19 pandemic. The government of Togo 
partnered with UC Berkeley, GiveDirectly, Innovations for Poverty Action, and local telecom providers 
to provide aid to Togolese citizens whose livelihoods were most disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The partnerships enabled the government to pull together diverse data sources, such as geospatial 
analytics and mobile phone metadata, and use machine learning to accurately estimate poverty and 
improve aid targeting. Roughly 140,000 Togolese were remotely identified and paid. The AI approach 
helped reach 8 to 14 percent more eligible recipients than the rule-based alternative approach being 
considered at the time.34

Existing deployments related to SDG 2: Zero Hunger 
SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable 
agriculture through specific targets such as ending all forms of malnutrition, doubling the productivity 
and incomes of small-scale food producers, and promoting sustainable food production and resilient 
agricultural practices.35 AI has already been shown to improve agriculture processes and productivity, 
food quality (including nutrition), and storage and distribution processes.36 

Sample use case: Educating farmers on approaches to improve yield. Outgrow is an agricultural and 
farmer engagement platform in India that connects farmers with high-value products and services, 
including automated soil labs and microclimatic weather devices.37 Using the AI-based platform, 
farmers can predict and detect crop disease in real time, learn how and when to irrigate, and connect 
with agricultural experts in multiple Indian languages. Outgrow’s platform supports more than 18 
crops and provides services to more than 200,000 farmers. 

Sample use case: Preserving plant biodiversity and enabling the discovery of resilient genes. Future 
Seeds, a global agricultural innovation hub, uses predictive models to identify habitats that host 
important crop biodiversity.38 The organization’s Colombia-based facility uses robotics, drones, and 
AI to help scientists identify traits that can help crops cope in extreme weather conditions, including 
water stress. With the goal of preserving key specimens and supporting food security, Future Seeds 
already has the largest collection of cassava, beans, and tropical forages in the world.39

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetChapter 2
How funding for AI 
initiatives supports SDGs

13

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetFunding toward harnessing AI for the SDGs aligns directionally with the five highest-potential 
areas identified by respondents to our survey of experts. Grant and private capital funding centers 
on Good Health and Well-Being (SDG 3), Quality Education (SDG 4), Affordable and Clean Energy 
(SDG 7), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), and Climate Action (SDG 13). In addition, about 
40 percent of private capital investments into the 20,000 AI companies we analyzed contributed 
directly or indirectly toward progress on SDGs.40

About 40 percent 
of private capital 
investments into the 
20,000 AI companies 
we analyzed 
contributed directly 
or indirectly toward 
at least one of the 17 
SDG thematic areas.

Some SDGs are well funded by both grants and private capital; the 
analysis shows Good Health and Well-Being (SDG 3) receives seven 
times more grant funding than other SDGs and the most private capital, 
which corresponds with its high number of not-for-profit deployments. 
Meanwhile, others are funded predominantly by one source. Consider 
Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), Sustainable Cities and 
Communities (SDG 11), and Climate Action (SDG 13), which are primarily 
funded through private capital, and Quality Education (SDG 4), which 
receives more grant funding. Private sector capital and grant funding 
could seem to complement each other, with one source addressing 
funding gaps left by the other. However, some SDGs—such as Life Below 
Water (SDG 14) and Gender Equity (SDG 5)—are not funded significantly 
by either source. 

Funding is not always in line with where the experts we surveyed see 
potential. Consider the relatively low private capital funding for Quality 
Education (SDG 4). Even for Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7) 
and Climate Action (SDG 13), more than 50 percent of private capital 
investment went toward autonomous vehicles for improving energy 
efficiency and reducing emissions. This suggests further potential for 
private entities to deploy capital toward SDG themes where AI has high 
potential (Exhibit 3).

An analysis of the location of grant recipients’ headquarters from a database of US-majority 
foundations reveals that from 2018 to 2023, only 10 percent of grants allocated toward AI 
initiatives that address one or more of the SDGs went to organizations based in low- or middle-
income countries.41 While organizations may have impact outside of the countries where they are 
headquartered, 60 percent of experts responding to our survey agreed that AI efforts today do not 
focus enough on benefiting lower-income countries (as opposed to higher-income or developed 
countries), where the need and impact can be the highest. 

Analysis of private capital shows that 36 percent of 9,000 companies addressing SDGs are 
headquartered in the United States, but these companies received 54 percent of total funding. We 
also found that while 20 percent of 9,000 companies addressing SDGs are headquartered in lower- 
or middle-income countries, they received a higher proportion (25 percent) of total funding. One 
reason for this is that Chinese companies receive a high proportion of investment.42 The remaining 
developing countries in the sample received only 3 percent of funding while representing 7 percent of 
the sample.

40 SDGs 8, 9, and 17 were excluded from this analysis due to the general applicability of AI to those SDGs.
41 This analysis is not holistic, because it analyzed grants only from Candid, which focuses primarily on US-based foundations. 

Additionally, Candid’s database takes 1.5 to 2.0 years to update because of a lag from IRS data. See “AI for Sustainable Development 
Goals,” Candid Foundation Directory, 2018–2023.

42 China is in the middle-income category. See “The World Bank in China,” World Bank, updated April 2024.

Challenges of scaling 
AI for social good

16

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetA recent report from Stanford University and Project Evident found that AI already has a 
considerable presence in the social and education sectors: 48 percent of funders and 66 percent 
of not-for-profit respondents say their organization uses some type of AI, and about 80 percent 
of funders and not-for-profits say that their organization would benefit from using more AI.43 Fully 
realizing the potential of AI for social good will require AI solutions to be deployed on a larger scale—
for instance, moving from regional in-country pilots to cross-country or cross-continent efforts. 

According to 72 percent of respondents to our expert survey, most efforts to deploy AI for social 
good to date have focused on research and innovation rather than adoption and scaling. Fifty-five 
percent of grants for AI research and deployment across the SDGs are $250,000 or smaller, which 
is consistent with a focus on targeted research or smaller-scale deployment rather than large-scale 
expansion (Exhibit 4).

In 
our 2018 report,44 we outlined bottlenecks broadly facing the industry to deploying AI for social good. 
These are largely still the same challenges today. The three factors cited most often by respondents 
to our expert survey as impeding AI-driven progress toward SDG targets are data availability, 
accessibility, and quality; AI talent availability and accessibility; and organizational receptiveness and 
change management (Exhibit 5). While these issues are common to any organization undertaking AI 
development, not-for-profits and other social good organizations face additional unique challenges. 
Below, we dig into what’s changed in these areas since 2018 and why they are still in many cases the 
biggest hurdle in deploying AI on a large scale.

Relevant data sets for SDG-related topics are challenging to create or curate because they require 
data from less-developed regions, in languages that are less widely spoken, and from more-
vulnerable demographic groups (which are the intended beneficiaries of many SDG initiatives). Where 
rich data sets do exist—such as those owned by telecom, satellite, or financial companies—they may 
be privately owned or expensive and therefore inaccessible to small organizations. Accessible data 
can have quality issues: entries may be missing, data may be poorly organized, or data may be in 
hard-to-access formats such as paper records and spreadsheets. 

In short, many social organizations simply do not have sufficient data or must manually clean 
significant amounts of data, a process that is too resource-intensive for many organizations. 

AI talent availability and accessibility
The supply of talent in AI-related fields has increased globally. According to Stanford HAI’s AI Index 
report 2024, the penetration of AI skills significantly increased from 2015 to 2023. The countries with 
the highest penetration rates as of 2023 were Germany, India, and the United States; penetration 
was 2.2 times higher in the United States than in the rest of the world.45 Talent is thus very unevenly 
distributed. As a result, governments, social enterprises, and not-for-profits—especially those in 
low- and middle-income countries—have limited access to the skills they need to innovate with 
AI. In addition, there is growing competition from the private sector. For example, applied AI job 
postings across sectors grew by 6 percent from 2021 to 2022.46 Furthermore, SDG initiatives may 
require AI skills in combination with knowledge in other areas, such as sustainable development, 
specific organizational contexts, or local culture; this combination can be especially hard to come 
by. In a recent survey of more than 4,000 not-for-profits by Google for Nonprofits, 40 percent of 
respondents said nobody in their organization was educated in AI.47

Organizational receptiveness to AI applications 
AI can help frontline workers determine which services or support to provide for vulnerable 
populations, such as a pregnant mother in a village, a survivor of human trafficking, or an unemployed 
individual or refugee looking to enter the workforce. But organizations can implement AI tools 
only if their frontline workers are receptive. Thus, organizations may need to adapt processes to 
accommodate new ways of working,48 such as using generative AI (gen AI) tools.

Not-for-profit organizations may have additional reasons to be less receptive to AI applications, 
including the following:

 — Applications may require time- and resource-intensive training. Without such training, workers 

may misunderstand the applications and become frustrated or fail to adopt them.

 — Processes and operating models may need updating. To integrate AI applications, organizations 
usually need to simultaneously adjust processes and operating models to capture the benefits of 
these applications. These changes may be challenging and time-consuming. 

 — Explainability may need to be treated as a priority from the start. Many AI applications rely on 

recommendations or predictions, and explainability of the AI—that is, the ability to explain model 
outputs appropriately and accurately—is key to getting users to trust and engage with the 
applications.

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planet — Organizations may have concerns about AI-related risks to vulnerable people. As discussed 

above, risks such as bias, malicious use, and privacy concerns can discourage organizations from 
using AI. These risks can have particularly negative impacts on the vulnerable people not-for-
profits work with, such as pregnant mothers and survivors of human trafficking.

 — Widespread alignment may be necessary. Implementation at scale may require collaboration and 
adoption across many stakeholders, including funders, governments, frontline organizations, and 
tech companies. Any one organization that is less receptive can impede the progress of the whole 
stakeholder group. 

The emergence of simpler gen AI tools offers hope. Gen AI tools are easy to use, and they make it 
easier to develop other software, which may expand AI use among organizations with limited data 
science capabilities. Gen AI is also expected to unlock value from open data by giving low-resource 
organizations, such as some not-for-profits or organizations in low-income countries, access to 
improved user experiences.49 About 70 percent of respondents to our experts survey believe that 
gen AI will have a net positive impact on SDG progress by enhancing productivity, personalization, 
and language translation; democratizing access to knowledge and its dissemination; and increasing 
awareness that can potentially lead to policy change. However, these benefits are yet to be realized, 
and much awareness building and upskilling work remains ahead. In a Google for Nonprofits survey of 
more than 4,000 not-for-profits, 50 percent of respondents said they plan to provide gen AI training 
to the communities they serve.50 

Additional barriers to scale
In addition to the three challenges outlined above, many other obstacles could hinder progress. 
For example, many people still have limited access to the internet.51 Although compute costs are 
lower today than in 2018, they are still unaffordable for many not-for-profits, and while free tools 
are emerging to build solutions, the high costs to run recent gen AI models at scale may widen the 
gap. Grants and political will are also required to create incentives for widespread adoption of many 
applications.

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetChapter 4
How stakeholders can 
accelerate the deployment 
of AI for social good

21

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetIn this section, we outline six complementary, cross-cutting approaches that have the potential 
to mitigate one or more of the challenges above. These actions are not mapped one-to-one to the 
scaling challenges outlined above, but each could help address at least one challenge. Mission-
driven organizations, governments, foundations, universities, ecosystems of developers, businesses, 
and other stakeholders can implement these approaches to support the use of AI for social good.

1. Forming partnerships to accelerate impact
Partnerships can fulfill many needs of mission-driven organizations and alleviate many of the 
challenges discussed above. AI applications may be developed by researchers or tech companies but 
require a frontline nongovernmental organization (NGO) to adopt them for impact; partnerships can 
bring these groups together to get solutions to the front line faster. Partnerships can also supplement 
data science or engineering talent and allow groups to share or develop data; codevelop or gain 
access to critical infrastructure, models, and applications; and promote awareness and trust through 
larger stakeholder communities. 

Some stakeholders have already explored partnerships that provide expanded reach, data, and 
resources.

Partnering for reach. Khushi Baby’s digital health platforms have reached more than 17,000 medical 
centers in India through increasingly large partnerships with village and state governments. These 
partnerships have proved crucial to reaching local patients.52 

Partnering for data. AirQo, a not-for-profit in Uganda, partners with city environment management 
authorities to measure and build data sets for air quality, enabling the authorities to formulate and 
implement actions to improve air quality.53 

Partnering for resources. PATH develops solutions to address pressing health issues. It has 
partnered with Amazon Web Services for computing credits and with Microsoft’s AI for Good team to 
identify new opportunities to use AI for public health.54 

Both public and private sector organizations can build innovation ecosystems that bring together 
stakeholders, generate ideas for AI solutions that target existing issues, and reduce barriers to 
impact. 

Disha, a UN-led initiative, brings together foundations, tech and telecom companies, AI ethics 
centers, academic institutions, and data providers to jointly build responsible AI solutions. Initial 
products include a solution built in partnership with a telecom provider to serve multiple NGOs in Asia 
on disaster resilience and recovery efforts by estimating people movement and poverty incidence 
using mobile data. Coalitions such as Disha can enable the deployment of more robust, standardized, 
and shared AI products to support millions of people globally.

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planet2. Supporting the development of digital public goods
Digital public goods can include models, software, standards, content, and data intended to 
contribute to sustainable development. Their availability can also simplify the development of novel AI 
for SDG solutions, alleviating challenges related to talent, funding, and compute. 

Organizations that produce SDG-relevant data sets and models may be able to make them 
accessible—or partially accessible—for clearly defined public interest initiatives. Existing AI for SDG 
initiatives have demonstrated that data collected by governments, telecom companies, technology 
companies, utilities providers, and content creators, as well as AI models themselves, can be 
harnessed for sustainable-development efforts. For example, Google DeepMind’s GraphCast is a 
ten-day global weather forecasting system that can be used to predict extreme weather events and 
prevent adverse outcomes for millions of people. The underlying open-source model is being used by 
weather agencies such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.55

Governments, technology companies, and funders can sponsor efforts to organize and curate 
existing digital public goods, reducing technical barriers to developing AI solutions for SDGs. Open-
data initiatives have begun to provide large-scale improvements to availability and accessibility by 
improving training data, sharing data sets, and improving model performance. One such initiative 
is Data4SDGs, a network of more than 700 organizations that has brokered more than 100 data 
partnerships to support goals related to climate, health, social inclusion, education, and more.56 
In another example, Data Commons provides access to data sets from publicly available, reliable 
sources such as the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.57 Users can ask 
questions in their own language and get immediate responses, accompanied by visuals.

However, initiatives to share data, code, and best practices remain underdeveloped. One researcher 
who focuses on data science for social good told us, “The coordination is poor, and we are not 
learning from each other. We are not sharing best practices. As a result, solutions are being invented 
from scratch in different parts of the world, leading to a waste of resources.”

While open-source communities do exist—and are tracked by the Digital Public Goods Alliance58—
there is a large gap in ready-to-customize AI assets and tools across most SDGs. It may be beneficial 
for those who consume these goods to create communities around them and build on one another’s 
work.

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planet3. Bolstering quality and usability of data 
Stakeholders could improve the scalability of data-driven AI for SDG applications, while reducing 
risks and improving output quality, by creating high-quality data sets (either publicly available or 
through select access management). It is particularly critical to support data collection in resource-
poor contexts and for disadvantaged populations, and to create incentives for organizations with rich 
data sets to make them available for social good applications.

Not-for-profit organizations that do not have—or cannot access—the data they need for a particular 
purpose may benefit from getting creative. For example, Rainforest Connection’s Guardian 
Platform uses solar-powered acoustic streaming devices—connected via Global System for Mobile 
Communication (GSM)—to gather a continuous recording of forest soundscapes. This audio record 
is then transmitted to the cloud, where AI tools analyze it in real time to detect illegal deforestation 
activities, enabling immediate intervention.59 Rainforest Connection has worked with more than 100 
NGOs and local conservation agencies to deploy sensors in more than 35 countries. In addition, 
tracking “exhaust data,” such as the location and navigation route of maritime vessels, could reveal 
unregulated and illegal fishing activities.

4. Expanding the pool of AI for SDG talent
Increasing the AI for SDG talent pool will require both near-term and longer-term initiatives. In 
the near term, academic institutions or companies with technical talent can make their own talent 
available to low-resource organizations on a part- or full-time basis. In the longer term, investments in 
training or relevant degrees can help grow the talent base, particularly in underrepresented regions 
or within vulnerable communities.

For example, several large companies—including Google, Microsoft, and Two Sigma—have used 
their data science talent for social endeavors by loaning or seconding talent to other organizations or 
allocating time for them to work on social good projects.60 DataKind, a global not-for-profit, works to 
make these loaning efforts possible by pairing global data science talent with projects.61 Additionally, 
Data.org launched the Capacity Accelerator Network (CAN), with the goal of training one million data 
practitioners around the world by 2032.62

Many of the experts we spoke to emphasized that AI talent needs to have a deep understanding 
of SDG fields or target regions. Not-for-profit educational initiatives have begun expanding the 
pool of talent in social good fields. In addition, the Google DeepMind scholarship program provides 
financial support to students from underrepresented groups pursuing graduate studies in AI-related 
and adjacent fields. The program is available at universities around the world, including partner 
institutions in Africa.63

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planet5. Taking an inclusive, user-centric approach 
AI solutions can be developed before an application has been tested with the end user. Human-
centric AI is a process by which the user experience is developed in tandem with AI solutions, with 
frequent user testing including during early deployment. This approach addresses challenges related 
to low organizational receptiveness and the need for change management to adapt to AI, specifically 
gen AI. Incorporating users from the beginning can build trust with communities and help ensure 
users are receptive to solutions. It also helps organizations avoid spending development time and 
costs on solutions that do not fully meet user needs. 

For example, Rainforest Connection started because forest rangers were spending more 
time fighting loggers than restoring biodiversity. So the organization recycled cell phones into 
autonomous, solar-powered listening devices that could remotely monitor and detect logging activity 
in rainforests. The devices, called Guardians, are hidden high in trees for better cell service and 
access to sunlight for power. They use machine learning models to detect logging sounds, such as 
chain saws and trucks, around the clock. While the solution worked in theory, the need to place the 
devices high in trees was a barrier to installation. The organization worked with biodiversity scientists 
to enhance adoption by helping local community members install the devices. Today, Rainforest 
Connection monitors more than one million acres in 106 protected reserves in 35 countries.64

6. Creating a ‘business model’ (where applicable)
Fundraising can be a barrier for organizations, particularly when it comes to the increased funding 
required to move from initial pilots to at-scale solutions. Respondents to our survey of experts 
identified funding as the fourth-most-critical challenge to scaling AI for SDG impact. Some not-
for-profit organizations have created business models that supplement or offset fundraising 
requirements by establishing continual-revenue streams—either through direct technology or by 
providing platforms for local entrepreneurship.65 

For example, Thorn, a not-for-profit that builds tools to defend children from sexual abuse, offers both 
pro bono and fee-based services to a mix of not-for-profits, government agencies, and technology 
platforms.66 

Scientific breakthroughs have increased the effectiveness of AI at pattern recognition, prediction, 
and creation. This progress has coincided with a rapidly growing number of successful AI 
deployments, but there are still challenges to scaling their use for addressing the SDGs. Realizing this 
potential will require stakeholders to collaborate more closely to ensure access to adequate talent, 
robust data solutions, and AI applications and models—and to ensure these models are more open-
sourced or scalable across user geographies around the world and can therefore meet people at the 
point of need.

By collaborating to find ways to put AI to work at scale for social good, mission-driven organizations, 
governments, foundations, universities, ecosystems of developers, and businesses can help solve 
some of the world’s most challenging and intractable problems. They can help thwart human 
trafficking, ensure girls and children all over the world receive the education they deserve, protect 
forests from illegal deforestation, support the health and safety of pregnant women and newborns, 
and so much more. If these things aren’t worth fighting for, what is?

AI for social good: Improving lives and protecting the planetMethodology

We set out to understand AI’s 
potential impact on the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) and assess 
how private and charitable and public 
capital is flowing toward the SDGs with 
the highest potential for AI impact. We 
collected several kinds of data to do so:

Use case library and not-for-profit 
deployments. We created a library of 600 
use cases in which AI could be used to 
advance the SDGs and more than 1,000 
not-for-profit deployments of AI toward 
these goals. To build this data set, we used 
a range of publicly available sources made 
available by not-for-profits, foundations 
funding their activities, and the United 
Nations. 

Survey and interviews. We surveyed about 
60 experts from 17 countries and 48 
organizations (including not-for-profits, 
foundations, technology companies, 
start-ups, academic institutions, and 
government) to learn their views related to 
SDGs where AI has the highest potential, AI 
risks, and barriers to scaling. Additionally, 
we interviewed more than 50 executives 
and senior leaders from not-for-profits, 
tech companies, and foundations globally.

Foundation grants. We analyzed more 
than 1,000 foundation grants filtered 
by the search terms “AI,” “ML,” “artificial 
intelligence,” and “machine learning” from 
2018 to 2023.1 Grants went to recipients 
in countries including Australia, Brazil, 
Belgium, Canada, China, India, Norway, 

Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States.

Analysis of private capital investment. 
Based on data from PitchBook, we 
analyzed approximately 20,000 
companies that have a clear focus on AI, 
machine learning, and big data and have 
gone through a funding round since 2020. 
Based on their descriptions, companies 
were tagged to one or more SDGs. 
The total lifetime funding of all tagged 
companies was used to determine the 
total funding per SDG. Because funding 
can be applicable to multiple SDGs, when 
the value of SDG funding is calculated, 
it exceeds the total amount invested 
when considered without SDG tagging. 
Roughly 35 percent of companies were 
headquartered in the United States. 

1  Analysis focuses on grants from mostly US-based foundations, and there is typically a time lag since the data is based on IRS data. But the analysis is representative of distribution 

across SDGs as well as scale of funding. See “AI for Sustainable Development Goals,” Candid Foundation Directory, 2018–2023.
