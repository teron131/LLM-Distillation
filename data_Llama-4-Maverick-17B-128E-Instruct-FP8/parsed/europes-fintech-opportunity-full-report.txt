Executive Summary

The deteriorating macroeconomic environment in Europe and around the world is hurting start-ups 
across sectors and has hit fintechs hard, with valuations declining and access to financing becoming 
more difficult.1 Viewed from a long-term perspective, however, European fintechs continue to gain 
in strength and relevance for customers and the economy. In each of the seven largest European 
economies, as measured by GDP, at least one fintech ranks among the five top banking institutions.2 

While some fintechs may not survive the current environment, others will gain market share and benefit 
from structural trends. Those able to build resilient, profitable business models with solid cash flows will 
become more competitive in the long term.3 

Strong fintechs offer customers greater choice and convenience. The competition they bring to banking 
systems is already helping modernize the financial-sector ecosystem in several European countries. In this 
report, we focus on three key aspects of Europe’s fintech sector: founding, funding, and scaling—that is, the 
ability of fintechs to set up in the first place, the ease with which they can access capital, and how well they 
can grow and thrive (see sidebar “Sources for this report”).

Our analysis highlights growing fintech activity in every European country (chapter 1)—including some 
unexpected pockets of strength in a few comparatively small economies such as Estonia, Luxembourg, and 
Malta. At the same time, we find a wide divergence of maturity and performance among fintech ecosystems 
by country, with substantial gaps between the top one-third and the rest (Exhibit 1). Two countries in 
particular stand out for their superior fintech ecosystem performance: the United Kingdom and Sweden. 

If fintech ecosystems in all European countries were able to attain the level of performance of the best 
in the European region, the upside could be substantial (chapter 2). Our analysis suggests that if the

bottom two-thirds in Europe could catch up with the top third, and if the top third could catch up with 
the United Kingdom, the number of fintech jobs in Europe would grow by a factor of 2.7 to more than 
364,000. The potential funding would grow by a factor of about 2.3, adding about €84 billion in investments, 
and valuations could grow by a factor of 2.3, to about €981 billion—almost twice the combined market 
capitalization of Europe’s top ten banking players with €516 billion.4 

As they look to boost fintech growth, countries across Europe and stakeholders in the fintech ecosystem 
need to address some overarching challenges, including market maturity, access to capital, a regulatory 
and legal framework that does more to foster innovation and growth, the mobility of talent, the requirements 
for scaling across borders, and customer openness. Existing market prerequisites such as language or 
currency will also be a factor in determining whether fintechs can emerge and scale. 

We conclude with some of the imperatives for the fintech sector in Europe as it seeks to build on its 
momentum and inject new competition into the financial system (chapter 3). These include the need 
to foster the harmonization of market structures within the European Union, encourage more diverse 
“homegrown” capital, foster regulation with an innovative mindset, become a magnet for global talent, 
enable fintechs to thrive in target markets, and increase customer choice and access.

Europe’s fintech opportunity 1

Fintechs are a force for growth, 
modernization, and customer 
satisfaction in Europe’s 
financial-services sector

Europe’s fintech sector has moved quickly from the fringes of the European financial landscape to its 
core. In each of the seven largest European economies by GDP—France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom—at least one fintech now ranks among the top five banking 
services institutions, as measured by market value.5 Germany and the Netherlands each has three in 
its top five—and the leading banking services institution in the Netherlands also ranked as the largest 
fintech in Europe by market valuation in mid-2022. 

Underlying the significant growth of fintechs in Europe and their increasingly mainstream positions are 
the contributions they make to customers, to the continent’s financial sector, and to the overall economy 
and society.

Fintechs are substantially improving customer satisfaction
For customers, the growing appeal of fintechs is that they create value with superior service at lower costs. 

Whereas the average customer satisfaction score (a measurement of customer loyalty and satisfaction) 
for banking is 30 out of 100, the latest figures show that several fintechs easily outperform leading 
international banks; one online financial-services platform in the United Kingdom achieved a very strong 
score of 80.6 Competitive pricing for existing services is an important part of the attraction. For example, 
international transfers and the end-customer price of stock trades transacted through fintechs can 
cost just 10 percent of the rates charged by traditional banking services institutions.7 This is a significant 
competitive advantage, because pricing is one of the top two reasons why customers use fintechs. A recent 
McKinsey retail banking consumer survey in seven large European countries found that 32 percent of 
respondents listed pricing as a main reason to use fintechs or digital banks; an equivalent number cited 
easy access (Exhibit 2).8 Speed of service also ranks high across Europe—although there has been criticism 
that after a generally customer-friendly onboarding process that includes straight-through processing, 
after-sales service sometimes lags behind that of incumbent peers.

Some fintechs offer financial opportunities to customers who may not have had access to them otherwise, 
including asset classes previously available only to institutions. For example, one German fintech

investment platform gives retail investors the opportunity to invest in private-equity funds, venture capital 
(VC) funds, and infrastructure funds. Other fintechs focus on customer segments previously underserved; 
for example, a French digital bank is providing online business banking to small and medium-size 
enterprises. Peer-to-peer lending fintechs offer private and institutional investors the possibility of investing 
directly in private loans. Fintechs also provide access to cryptocurrencies and innovative value-adding 
features such as “bill split,” virtual debit cards, and smart chatbots. 

For the financial ecosystem, fintechs are a catalyst for disruptive innovation and growth
Fintechs make important contributions to the financial-services ecosystem, help create new revenue pools, 
and challenge incumbent offerings and operations. In doing so, they contribute to a more vibrant and 
robust financial sector. 

With their agility and speed, fintechs are well equipped to accommodate many new trends in the financial 
sector, including embedded finance and “distributed ledger” technology. They launch new products 
and services much faster than incumbent banks, with an average time to market of two to six months 
versus 12 to 18 months for incumbents, according to our analysis. This enables them to tap into emerging 
opportunities and markets more quickly. 

The ability of fintechs to adopt and adapt technology puts them in a solid starting position to embrace 
innovation and serve as a long-term catalyst for Europe’s prosperity. For example, one leading UK-based 
fintech has evolved from serving as a cross-border payments product for retail customers to serving small 
businesses. It now provides cross-border payment infrastructure to banks, financial institutions, and 
enterprises of all sizes.

Europe’s fintech opportunity Fintechs can serve as a bellwether  
for incumbents, signaling which  
innovations are successful.

Fintechs also act as ongoing challengers and front-runners in providing unique customer experiences and 
lean-banking processes. For incumbents, fintechs can serve as a bellwether, signaling which innovations are 
successful and highlighting ways in which incumbents can become more competitive. Today, many leading 
European banks rely on fintech partnerships across a wide range of areas, particularly in operations and 
payments. Acquisitions also allow incumbent banks to benefit from fintech know-how. For example, a large 
banking player in the United Kingdom is targeting new customer groups via the acquisition of a banking 
fintech that is supporting families in educating their children on healthy savings and spending behavior.

Our analysis suggests that the success of fintechs is not a result of a weak incumbent-banking market. 
Indeed, leading banking markets can provide a fertile breeding ground for successful fintechs. At the same 
time, strong fintech ecosystems can also be found in less developed banking markets. Thus, the structure of 
the banking market is not to blame for a suboptimal development of the fintech ecosystem. Likewise, fintechs 
per se do not pose a threat to the strength and health of the banking sector. 

In the long run, incumbents working together with fintechs as forward-thinking business partners could 
make the financial sector more robust and vibrant and strengthen the competitiveness of Europe’s financial 
industry. This can be achieved through a successful interplay of the strengths of both incumbents and 
fintechs—for example, by combining incumbents’ expertise and capabilities in credit risk assessments or 
regulatory processes with the sharp customer focus of fintechs.

Fintechs contribute to economic growth and employment
Fintechs are an important source of potential growth for the overall economy. Across Europe, they have created 
approximately 134,000 jobs, as well as fostering innovation and creating economic growth momentum.9 

A growing fintech sector creates future-focused jobs in fields such as data science, IT and programming, and 
design. Vibrant start-up hubs such as Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Lisbon, Madrid, and Paris also serve as 
magnets for both domestic and international talent, further strengthening the start-up ecosystems in these 
regions. Indeed, fintechs in Europe have scaled up their hiring significantly at a time when incumbent banks 
in Europe have been reducing their workforces by about 3 percent, or 60,000 jobs, annually since 2019.10 
Fintechs are starting from a rather modest base, but job growth is strong: in 2021 alone, the top ten European 
fintechs employed more than 20,000 individuals,11 which implies growth of more than 80 percent over two 
years since 2019. Due to a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, some fintechs have recently reduced 
staff, but we expect the overall upward trend to continue.

Europe’s fintech opportunity As of June 2022, from a value creation perspective, fintechs in Europe represent a total valuation of almost 
€430 billion. That is more than the combined market capitalization of Europe’s seven largest listed banks 
as of June 30, 2022.12 The future will show whether fintechs can fulfill the expectations implied by current 
valuations—especially given rising interest rates and therefore higher investor expectations regarding 
profitability. Indeed, these adverse macroeconomic conditions will likely persist for some time, affecting 
various segments unevenly, and valuations of several fintechs have already decreased in the latest funding 
rounds. Fintech management teams, few of which have experience navigating such environments, will 
need to pivot from a pure-growth mindset to focus on profitability and scale while meeting increased 
expectations for operational maturity.

Fintechs’ ability to attract venture capital—currently exceeding €57 billion (considering more than 700 
European fintechs)—puts them in a position to invest heavily in growth and to create competitive advantages, 
thereby contributing to the economy with successful business models. For example, fintechs invest substantial 
resources in modern IT infrastructures to achieve cost advantages, ensure scalability, and foster innovation. 

So far, fintechs in Europe have mainly focused on building up successful retail propositions. This leaves 
further opportunity to disrupt the B2B financial-services market and tap into areas such as monetization 
of bank and market data, as well as business models that embrace megatrends such as environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) investments. An emerging open-banking ecosystem in some countries could 
also fuel innovation and lower barriers to new customer propositions, such as through low-cost securities 
trading or foreign interest rate deposits.

The divergent national 
performance of fintech 
ecosystems in Europe points to 
considerable untapped potential 

Our research highlights a huge variance across European fintech ecosystems. For example, the United 
Kingdom and Sweden significantly outperform their European peers across all critical performance areas. 
We compare and discuss in detail these performance factors, which are common to fintech ecosystems in 
every country, and subsequently focus on a number of country-specific market realities that help explain 
why some places are ahead and others behind (see sidebar “Our analysis of fintech performance”).

Exhibit 3 provides an overview of the performance of European fintech ecosystems based on five KPIs. 
As well as showing that the United Kingdom and Sweden are clear leaders across all the dimensions, it 
also highlights a second tier of countries with strong fintech sectors across most of the dimensions we 
examine: Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Together with the top-ranked countries, they 
constitute the top one-third of fintech performers in Europe. 

This exercise reveals several notable findings. First, our heat map suggests that there is a correlation 
between geography and performance. Countries in northern Europe tend to significantly outperform other 
geographies. Central Europe and the Mediterranean countries are in the midfield, and eastern Europe has 
a significant gap compared with the leaders. Switzerland, a leader despite its location in central Europe, is a 
geographic outlier to this pattern.

Second, based on this analysis, strong ecosystem performance does not seem to be significantly influenced 
by market size in terms of GDP. Indeed, some of the smaller European economies in terms of GDP—
Denmark, Ireland, and the Netherlands—significantly outperform France and Germany, two of Europe’s 
largest economies.

Third, some smaller countries show singular strengths. For example, the Republic of Cyprus ranks eighth in  
the number of fintechs founded per million capita, Lithuania is a top-five country with a relatively high number 
of 6.5 deals per million capita, and Austria is in the top one-third with fintech funding of €46 per capita.

Taking a deeper look, our analysis suggests, unsurprisingly, that countries with stronger market 
prerequisites—for example, stronger scores in international rankings such as the Global Entrepreneurship 
Index and the Global Talent Competitiveness Index 2021, as well as the level of digital bank usage—are 
also those that tend to show higher performance along the growth stages (and vice versa).13 The United 
Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Denmark—all of which are leaders—rank in 
the top third for these indicators. 

13 See Zoltan Acs et al., Global Entrepreneurship Index 2019, Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute, January 2020; and Bruno Lanvin

Europe’s fintech opportunity Our analysis of fintech performance

For the analysis of overall performance, we ranked the EU-27 countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland based on the 
performance of their fintech ecosystems along the three growth stages: founding, funding, and scaling. We used five key 
performance indicators:

Stage 1: Filling the pipeline

 — number of fintechs founded per million capita in 2021

Stage 2: Funding growth

 — fintech funding per capita in 2021 in euros

 — number of deals per million capita in 2021

Stage 3: Scaling fintechs

 — number of fintech unicorns per capita in 20211

 — size of the fintech workforce as a percentage of the total workforce in 2021

To obtain an overall score, we averaged the countries’ rankings across the five KPIs and classified them as top, middle, or 
bottom third, according to their score. We acknowledge that these KPIs do not in themselves constitute a comprehensive 
analysis of all factors that can contribute to overall performance. Nonetheless, they are indicative of the key strengths and 
weaknesses of fintech performance. 

Some countries with a GDP of less than $100 billion performed relatively well on some of our KPIs. Since these numbers 
may be affected by the low sample size of fintechs in these countries in the observed time frame, we acknowledge their 
performance but do not include them in the exhibits, which focus on countries with GDP greater than $100 billion. 

1 Fintech unicorns are defined here as fast-growing, technology-based companies with a valuation exceeding $1 billion (based on recent funding rounds).

The variations in Europe’s fintech ecosystem performance are evident at all 
three growth stages 
Our analysis shows wide performance gaps in each of the three stages of founding, funding, and scaling.

Filling the fintech pipeline. For this founding criterion, we used the number of fintechs in 2021 per million 
people as the key performance metric. The analysis shows that more than half of European countries 
have fewer than ten fintechs per million residents, creating a significant gap compared with best-in-class 
countries; for example, Ireland and Switzerland each has 30 fintechs per million residents, and the United 
Kingdom has 26 (Exhibit 4). On average, the top five countries (with a GDP greater than $100 billion) have 
25 fintechs per million residents. Neither GDP nor R&D spending appears to be correlated with a “founding 
spirit” within the countries, because there is no recognizable pattern. Nevertheless, as expected, an

and aspirations of the local population as they affect the establishment of new companies—reveals that 
countries with a higher entrepreneurial index also seem to produce more fintechs per capita.14

countries in Europe that perform the best have among the highest funding per capita, as do the others in 
the top one-third of our ranking (Exhibit 5). In countries that perform less well, including Greece, Poland, 
and Romania, per capita funding is significantly lower. While some countries have managed to increase per 
capita funding by as much as a factor of six in the past three years, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Portugal still 
lag behind their peers significantly because the total volume of funding is still low.

Europe’s fintech opportunity The growth rate in recent years of fintech funding in some countries—such as Germany, Greece, and 
Ireland—has been lower in comparison with markets such as the Netherlands and France. This lower growth 
rate makes it harder to launch future fintechs and more challenging for existing ones to scale. When it 
comes to different growth stages, the United Kingdom is the top performer in both early-stage (seed and 
series A) and late-stage (series B+) per capita funding (Exhibit 6). The United Kingdom led the European 
market with a total volume of approximately €1.3 billion for early-stage funding and €8.3 billion for late-
stage funding in 2021. That performance compares favorably with other countries, including the United 
States: while US GDP is about ten times larger than that of the United Kingdom, US spending on funding is 
only four times larger (see sidebar “How fintech in Europe compares with the United States”). By contrast, 
several countries in Europe, particularly in eastern Europe, had very little early-stage funding in 2021 and no 
late-stage funding at all.

Europe’s fintech opportunity How fintech in Europe compares with the United States

Using the same three life cycle aspects of founding, funding, and scaling, a comparison between Europe and the 
United States is instructive (exhibit). The United States exceeds the European average and is within the top third across 
all KPIs—with particular strength when it comes to the contribution of US fintechs to the economy and the workforce. 

How to explain the strength of the United States compared with the European average? Many factors could be at play 
here that correspond to similar factors in Europe. For example, the United States has a large home market, but it also 
has just one primary language and largely harmonized banking regulation—thus benefiting from favorable market 
structure conditions. Market maturity is also stronger than in various European countries, with the venture capital 
(VC) community, especially in the tech sector, perfecting funding mechanisms from earliest seed funding through to 
IPOs. The United States has strong connections with all the other large economies and has long served as a magnet for 
investors, making access to capital easier: US pension funds and other institutional investors provide venture capital 
in ways that are restricted in some parts of Europe, where risk concerns tend to be larger. Nevertheless, our analysis 
shows that some individual countries, including the United Kingdom, outperform the United States in the funding stage. 
In addition, US companies can easily attract talent from the world’s best universities; regions such as Silicon Valley, 
south of San Francisco, or New York City, as the US financial center, exert a strong pull on foreign talent, although 
immigration measures have somewhat limited the flow.

Europe’s fintech opportunity The limited scale of fintechs may  
be related to the relatively low level  
of internationalization of business 
models, which can serve as a constraint 
on growth.

Scaling fintechs. As a proxy to judge the ability of countries in Europe to scale their fintech ecosystems, we 
looked at the prevalence of fintech unicorns.15 Most countries with more than one unicorn show a timeline 
between six and eight years from funding to becoming a unicorn. The United Kingdom has the best scaling 
track record by far with 32 unicorns in total—four times as many as France and the Netherlands, the 
countries with the next largest numbers of unicorns.

In some countries, the limited scale of fintechs may be related to the relatively low level of internationalization  
of business models, which can serve as a constraint on growth. Europe’s fintech leaders, including the 
United Kingdom and Sweden, tend to have a global footprint. For example, the leading neobank in the 
United Kingdom had a presence in 34 countries including the United States and three Asian markets in 
2021. In Sweden, an open-banking platform is present in 18 countries. 

Country-specific market conditions explain some of the differences in ecosystem 
performance across Europe
Closing the gap between leading European countries and those in the bottom or middle third of the rankings 
requires an examination of the factors inhibiting the sector’s success. Here we focus on six factors that can 
have an impact on the ecosystem, and for which strategic improvements can make a difference in both the 
short and medium term. The six factors are market structure and maturity; access to capital; the regulatory 
and legal framework; talent mobility and acquisition; requirements for scaling, including internationalization; 
and customer openness.

Market structure and maturity. These elements can depend partly on culture, language, and history. For 
example, having a widely spoken language or a common currency and harmonized regulation can help—
and the lack of those factors can be a hindrance. We see three main dimensions to this aspect. The first 
is how long a fintech or broader start-up scene has been present, since markets learn and improve over 
time. Second, mature markets can differentiate themselves by the extent to which a second generation of 
entrepreneurial founders is emerging that can learn from the previous generation and count on them to 
be mentors, supporters, advisers, or investors. Such networks do exist: for example, more than 15 former 
employees of two of the largest UK fintechs are now active with their own start-ups.16 This demonstrates 
that fintech hubs can be developed around unicorns and decacorns, with new start-ups providing 
complementary services to them and their customers. It also shows the potential of clustering effects 

15 Fintech unicorns are defined here as fast-growing, technology-based companies with a valuation exceeding $1 billion (based on recent 

funding rounds).

Europe’s fintech opportunity emerging in regions such as Zurich, where prominent tech giants have headquarters or large local offices.17 
For example, McKinsey analysis shows that the Netherlands already has a strong start-up ecosystem, with 
a high number of start-ups per capita and a society in which starting a business is highly valued. Market 
maturity may be one contributing factor to the Netherlands’ strong fintech landscape.18 

Access to capital. Fintech funding in Europe has significantly increased over the past five years, but not 
uniformly and with sizable funding gaps between European leaders and their peers. Looking at the various 
funding stages, we find that less than 20 percent of all capital raised goes to early-stage financing, which 
points to risk aversion among some European investors. More than one-third of all European countries—
most of them in eastern Europe—did not have any late-stage funding. This unevenness threatens to dry up 
the pipeline for early-stage fintechs because they have less access to funding than the overall investment 
numbers might suggest. In addition, some late-stage fintechs may need to seek funding from countries 
outside their home market. 

The source of funding is as important as the recipient, and the little funding available in some of these 
underserved markets mostly comes from abroad—as much as 81 percent in 2021.19 Significant European 
money pools such as pension funds and life insurance policies tend not to be sufficiently tapped because of 
more restrictive regulations compared with the United States—although here too there is some movement. 
Pension funds in the United States are large investors in private markets with sophisticated investment 
teams and board members who are familiar with the risks and returns of VC. Some European countries are 
trying to build similar strengths. In Scandinavia in particular, capital accumulation institutions are already 
taking a more active role. Sweden, for example, allows pension funds to invest up to 40.0 percent of their 
capital in illiquid assets—compared with just 7.5 percent in Germany (excluding a 25.0 percent limit for real 
estate investments).

17A decacorn is defined in this context as a grown unicorn with a valuation greater than $10 billion.

A tale of two countries: Fintech lessons from France and the United Kingdom

Regulators and other authorities in both France and the United Kingdom have played important roles in helping 
develop local markets. 

In France, rapid growth of unicorns
In 2019, the French government set a goal for start-up growth in France: 25 unicorns by 2025.1 That number had been 
exceeded by January 2022—well ahead of schedule. Behind this success story are several government initiatives that 
support young tech companies, including fintechs, in key ways: 

Process guidance. The regulatory landscape can be complex and overwhelming for fintech start-ups. To address this 
issue, regulators in France set up a body to support fintechs and help them navigate the landscape by directing them 
to the relevant authority. This body also convenes ecosystem players in the Fintech Regulation Forum to discuss the 
current regulatory requirements, review the appropriateness of the measures, and initiate adjustments if necessary. 

18

Europe’s fintech opportunity A tale of two countries: Fintech lessons from France and the United Kingdom
(continued)

Business-creation simplification. Enacted in 2019, the Business Growth and Transformation Action Plan (Loi PACTE) 
aims to simplify business creation for start-ups and adapt labor laws and regulations as necessary. One update has 
made employee savings plans more attractive to prospective employees—strengthening fintechs by helping them 
secure top talent. 

Innovation enablement. Loi PACTE also ushered in a regulatory change that supports fintechs’ product offerings in the 
cryptocurrency space. This change is related to initial coin offering regulations and creates special visas that allow the 
issuance of digital tokens. Banque de France launched an experiment using central bank digital currency, and various 
fintechs participated. 

Building on the ambition set in 2019, the French government launched the Scale-Up Europe initiative in 2021. In 
collaboration with the European Commission and other member states, the initiative has convened more than 300 
founders, investors, researchers, and corporations with the goal of Europe becoming home to ten tech giants, each 
valued at more than €100 billion, by 2030.

In the United Kingdom, a focus on greater sustainability
The United Kingdom has historically been an attractive market for fintechs in Europe and a front-runner in promoting 
open banking. It interacts with fintechs in a relatively nonbureaucratic way. For example, it states licensing 
requirements clearly and provides legal support to help entrepreneurs easily understand the process. To further pave 
the way for a green and technologically advanced financial sector, the government in 2021 announced that the United 
Kingdom will be implementing many of the recommendations made in the Kalifa review of UK fintech and the UK listing 
review. These include the following:

Policy and regulation. Plans call for the design of a digital finance package for emerging technology and 
implementation of a “scale box” to support firms focusing on innovative technologies. The goal is to integrate fintechs 
into trade policy.

Investments. The United Kingdom will expand R&D tax credits, establish a fintech growth fund of £1 billion, and reduce 
the percentage of capital freely available to the public to improve the listing environment.

International attractiveness and competitiveness. Steps include the design of an international action plan for fintechs, 
launch of an international fintech credential portfolio, and international collaboration through the Centre for Finance, 
Innovation and Technology.

National connectivity. The government will nurture the top ten fintech clusters; enhance the national coordination 
strategy through the Centre for Finance, Innovation and Technology; and accelerate the development and growth of 
fintech clusters.

19

Europe’s fintech opportunity The regulatory and legal landscape. Some European countries see their regulators as an important 
facilitator of innovation. For example, in France, financial regulators are evolving to become strategic 
partners for the financial sector, and in the Netherlands, local regulators have recognized that fintechs’ 
products and services do not always fit with existing rules; Dutch regulators thus interpret obligations 
for fintechs in proportion to their size and complexity. In other countries, existing regulatory frameworks 
to support the establishment, growth, and value of fintechs have room for improvement. Regulators and 
political actors serve as crucial enablers for the creation and protection of an innovative fintech ecosystem. 
Mandates of relevant bodies can reflect the ambition of finding the right balance between enabling fintech 
innovation and ensuring customer protection. While mandates define key goals and boundaries, responsible 
actors are asked to set priorities and translate ambitions into actions (see sidebar “A tale of two countries: 
Fintech lessons from France and the United Kingdom”).

European payment service directives for data exchanges in financial industries may create new 
opportunities for fintechs. These directives will enable fintechs to access customer data from all financial 
players in Europe, giving rise to new business models. This has happened in the United Kingdom, a 
pioneer in open data for finance. Other countries with advance regulation include Switzerland. The Swiss 
Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) was among the first regulators to approve token trading on 
distributed-ledger technology (DLT) and has since spearheaded a technology-agnostic regulation approach 
enabling DLT and other new technologies to flourish. 

But obstacles to fintech growth remain. Collaboration models with regulators are not always structured 
optimally, especially for small fintechs. For example, these collaborations might lack a clearly defined 
fintech–regulator interface. Overall, there is still a heavy focus on risks and control, while support for 
innovation tends not to be considered to the same extent. As a result, standardized processes associated 
with regulations often inhibit fintechs’ ability to move quickly in an environment in which agility is essential.

Talent mobility and acquisition. Europe as a region has a major skills gap that needs to be closed, and not 
just for fintechs.20 Along with an overall shortage of talent, visa requirements and bureaucratic processes for 
obtaining work permits in some countries can act as a brake on talent acquisition, as can high income taxes. 
Perceptions about the attractiveness of financial centers like London or Zurich as places to live and work 
also play a role. While one in four graduates in Europe finishes higher education with a STEM degree, the 
share of STEM graduates varies widely across European countries, especially in computing and information 
technology (IT), which are critical for fintechs. Fintech ecosystems in some European countries thus rely 
heavily on foreign talent—although attracting that talent is challenging. 

Remote work has increased the competition between fintechs and other tech firms for IT talent. The 
United Kingdom, for one, has announced a new visa scheme that allows workers in the fintech industry to 
come to the United Kingdom without employer sponsorship. However, talent can come to the country not 
only through attractive employers and working conditions but also through active university promotion. 
Switzerland is home to ETH Zurich and EPFL in Lausanne, two of the highest-ranked universities in the 
world. The high level of state support for these universities helps produce top talent and create new start-
ups. At ETH alone, 34 start-up spin-offs were created in 2020.21 

In general, European countries have great appeal. Many European cities appear year after year in the 
rankings of the world’s most livable cities, which makes them favorable locations for fintechs. Nevertheless, 
the downside to an area concentrated with attractive employers is an emerging competition for talent. This

need to be able to expand beyond  
their home market. 

may be one reason why some fintechs have decided to build new hubs in attractive but lower-cost regions 
such as Portugal.

Requirements for scaling and internationalization. To scale up, fintechs in Europe need to be able to 
expand beyond their home markets. Even within a single market such as the European Union, differences 
in language, regulation, culture, and sometimes currency can create barriers. Export agencies can 
support companies in their global ambitions with advice but are not yet equipped to meet the needs of 
fintechs; their expertise is in more typically established trade relations based on physical goods. Fintechs 
may therefore be tempted to limit their international growth or focus only on markets where they feel 
comfortable because of factors such as a common language or cultural similarities. For example, one 
large European neobank is scaling from Barcelona to Latin America by taking advantage of the shared 
Spanish language.

Customer openness. Different levels of digital maturity, the lack of broadband infrastructure, and other 
structural challenges in some countries can limit the reach of fintechs. Customers may also have limited 
understanding of risks, including data security. Such issues play out in favor of incumbent banks, which 
tend to have a higher level of trust among the public than fintechs. Research from the United Kingdom 
shows that fintechs need to offer significantly superior products that provide clear benefits or convenience 
to customers to overcome this lack of trust. In other countries, customer protection associations or 
governments may be pushing fintechs to provide solutions that increase customer trust. Regulatory 
differences can be factors, too. For example, customer protection laws are tougher in some countries 
than in others. Know-your-customer stipulations in some countries, including Estonia and Sweden, are 
more digital, making it easier for customers to switch to new offers from fintechs. In Estonia, for example, 
residents and “e-residents”—who do not have to live in Estonia—can open a bank account with minimal 
requirements without going to a branch. All they need is an e-ID card, which 99 percent of the Estonian 
population has. With the help of the e-ID card, customers can verify their identity in a few minutes and at any 
time, and thus open an account completely digitally.

Calculating the upside: Europe’s fintech opportunity promises more jobs, larger 
funding volumes, and higher valuations
What is the potential upside for European fintechs if the lower-performing countries could rise to the level 
of the best in region and if the leading countries could catch up with the United Kingdom? We have built a 
model that estimates what could happen to fintech jobs, fintech funding volume, and fintech valuations if all 
countries in Europe attained the levels per capita of the best-performing countries.

21

Europe’s fintech opportunity Exhibit 7 shows the result of this hypothetical exercise. The overall number of jobs could grow by a factor 
of 2.7, to more than 364,000, and the number of jobs in the “follower” countries—those catching up with 
the leaders—could increase as much as sixfold. These would be next-generation jobs in fields such as data 
science, digital marketing, IT, and design. Potential funding would grow by a factor of about 2.3, adding 
about €84 billion in investments. The relative strength of the United Kingdom is evident here—funding 
volume for the top third of European countries would grow fourfold if lifted to the United Kingdom’s level. 
Showing a potential of more than half a trillion euros, valuations in Europe could grow by approximately 2.3 
times to €981 billion. Getting there is possible, but it requires the aligned and collective push of multiple 
stakeholders along a clear action plan.

Europe’s fintech opportunity 3

A focused push along six 
strategic areas could help all 
European countries catch 
up with fintech leaders 

For lower- and middle-performing countries, catching up with the leaders will require a clearly defined 
programmatic agenda and ongoing commitment. In the process, established structures will need to 
be further developed. The success of this agenda requires the buy-in and active participation of all 
stakeholders—including investors, incumbent banks, political players, regulatory bodies, and fintechs 
themselves. In this final chapter, we examine several strategic options that fintechs and their stakeholders in 
Europe can consider as they look to grow and develop the sector.

Drive the alignment of market structures within the European Union
The goal: a European market structure that is easy for fintechs to navigate and that enables them in 
developing a truly scalable business model. 

An overall simplification and harmonization of fragmented national country regulation is already taking 
place in the European Union, enabling fintechs to understand key pillars of legal frameworks and to focus 
on regional specifics. The further development of cultural exchanges among countries will better equip 
fintechs to understand key customer needs outside their home market. Meanwhile, customers may catch up 
with a more digitalized way of living. 

Encourage more diverse, ‘homegrown’ capital 
The aim here is to increase funding for fintechs along all stages (seed, series A, and later stages) for 
the protection of influence and local interests and, at the same time, reduce exposure to geopolitical 
developments. In addition, successful and sustainable growth depends on an effective support ecosystem 
beyond capital injections—for example, strong adviser networks and access to experts.

Local political players and regulators have an important role to play in shaping restrictions on institutional 
investors’ access to growth capital. For example, they could create stronger incentives for venture capital 
and private-equity investments compared with debt investments. Relaxing investment restrictions 
for capital accumulation institutions and aligning them with those of other countries could also make 
a difference. For example, only about 10 percent of German insurers’ investments are currently in 
alternative assets such as venture or private capital, whereas in the United Kingdom this share is at 
approximately 30 percent.22 

Increased attention to diversity in society can also lead investors to use their interest, and ultimately capital, 
in a fair way without disadvantaging specific groups. Politics can play a supporting role in this through 
campaigns and other activities.

23

Europe’s fintech opportunity Foster regulation with an innovative mindset
The goal: a regulatory framework that fosters innovation and provides companies with the necessary 
conditions to compete domestically and internationally while ensuring stability and protecting both investors 
and customers.

Fintechs can actively work to make regulators even more aware of the societal benefits of their products 
and services. They can also commit to taking regulatory considerations into account early in their product 
development process. In addition, fintechs can use their customer orientation to implement regulatory 
requirements in a user-friendly way.

Political actors and customer-based regulation with a systematic focus on growth and innovation can 
contribute to an environment that fosters fintech start-ups and their growth. Programmatic coordination 
aimed at strengthening the fintech ecosystem is particularly important in this context. Specifically, this 
can mean minimizing the administrative burden and associated costs for fintechs and adapting regulatory 
requirements where necessary as well as making implementation more customer friendly. Likewise, 
innovation for better capital intermediation and mobilization is required to ensure fintechs have the 
necessary capital composition at the right time. 

Whereas some countries, such as Estonia and the United Kingdom, try to reduce bureaucratic hurdles in the 
licensing process, the United Kingdom also provides a support structure between regulators and fintechs 
to create trust. For example, regulators provide “sandboxes” that allow fintechs to test and demonstrate 
innovative business models with dummy customer data. This keeps regulators informed about innovations in 
the financial sector and helps them align regulation with the latest market developments.

Become a magnet for global talent 
The goal: a fintech ecosystem that can compete with global tech hubs for top talent from around the world.

Fintechs can do their part by offering attractive jobs with excellent development opportunities. They can 
also commit to creating a modern work culture that responds to a diversity of backgrounds and needs. For 
example, the ability to work remotely with no in-person office requirement can be a valuable offering for 
prospective employees. Likewise, fintechs could meet the special needs and requirements of international 
hires. A holistic program that offers support in obtaining a visa, for example, could be a very attractive perk. 

Political players and regulators can also help establish modern ways of working within their countries. 
For example, remote working could include working from another country. This is currently easier in some 
countries than others due to regulatory restrictions, but more flexibility in labor laws could make it easier for 
fintechs—especially for those based in less attractive cities or regions—to attract the right talent. 

Furthermore, local political players are in a position to make the tax framework appealing to foreign talent. 
For example, reducing the individual tax burden on income or employee stock ownership plans provides 
incentives for talented people to apply for jobs in such countries; low income tax rates in Switzerland may 
be a contributing factor to the country’s relative strength in fintech ecosystem performance. Additionally, 
political players and regulators could consider simplifying visa processes. This move would not only 
allow companies to more easily integrate foreign hires but also signal to the world that the country values 
international diversity in its fintech ecosystem. The promotion of talent exchange programs at universities or 
international internships within the European Union may also help attract talent.

24

Europe’s fintech opportunity Enable fintechs to thrive in target markets 
The aim: a support structure of hubs in target markets that advise fintechs on market requirements and help 
them to adjust their business model accordingly.

Fintechs may be able to make more informed decisions about future target markets if all stakeholders—
from investors to incumbent banks to public players and regulatory bodies—bundled their insights on 
foreign markets with the respective foreign regulations and industry requirements in one central hub. The 
establishment of internationalization hubs in key areas could create central points of access where fintechs 
and other start-ups could receive legal advice, get market insights on customer segments, and connect 
to support networks in the target country. A European institution such as the Enterprise Europe Network 
could serve as a potential central point of contact for this purpose.

Increase customer choices and access
The goal: a wider range of innovative, safe, high-quality, and convenient-to-use offers with low barriers and 
minimal risk for customers switching to or participating in fintech.

If fintechs put as much focus on product safety and stability as they do on customer experience, they 
might be able to avoid some regulatory challenges from the start. For example, they could go beyond 
established data and customer protection norms and be more transparent about securities and the 
inherent risk to customers before trading. By using their capabilities in customer communication and 
implementing customer requirements, fintechs can even turn regulatory compliance into a competitive 
advantage. Incumbent banks have an opportunity to partner with fintechs to drive innovative B2C and 
B2B propositions, because each can learn from the other. Such partnerships also foster customer trust in 
fintechs and new digital business models.

Political players and regulators could also develop Europe-wide initiatives to make it easier for fintech 
companies to demonstrate their credibility to customers—for example, by recognizing fintechs with official 
certifications or awards such as Singapore’s SFF Global FinTech Awards, announced by the Monetary 
Authority of Singapore and the Singapore FinTech Association.23 Such prizes, awarded by public authorities, 
can increase customer trust in fintechs.

Fintechs have made major inroads into Europe’s banking landscape and are becoming central to its core. 
That is good news for customers, who will benefit from increased choice, and for financial systems, which 
will become more competitive and modern. But this is just the start: while a few countries have already 
emerged as leaders in Europe’s fintech space, the potential for growth is strong everywhere in the region. If 
countries could rise to the level of the best in region, the upside could be significant for the economy as well 
as for fintechs themselves. In the coming months and years, it will be critical for all stakeholders—including 
public institutions, established financial industry players, and fintechs—to combine their strengths by 
establishing the enabling structure and mechanisms the sector needs to reach its full potential.
