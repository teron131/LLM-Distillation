McKinsey Global Institute

The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact base 
to aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s 
companies and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, 
and functional knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are 
solely the responsibility of MGI directors and partners. Our research is currently grouped into 
five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity—creating and harnessing the world’s assets productively

 — Resources of the world—building, powering, and feeding the world 

 — Human potential—achieving the potential of human talent

 — Global connections—shaping of economies by flows of trade, people, capital, and ideas

 — Technologies and markets of the future—the next big arenas of value and competition

We aim for independent and fact-based research and analysis. None of our work is 
commissioned or funded by any business, government, or other institution; we share our 
results publicly free of charge; and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While 
we engage multiple distinguished external advisers to contribute to our work, the analyses 
presented in our publications are MGI’s alone, and any errors are our own.

In brief

Global balance sheet 2022:  
Enter volatility 

The global balance sheet takes stock of the wealth 
and health of the global economy, looking at the 
assets and liabilities of households, corporations, 
governments, and financial institutions. For 
nearly three decades, the global balance sheet 
continuously grew faster than GDP, as described 
in MGI’s 2021 report The rise and rise of the global 
balance sheet. This growth then accelerated 
sharply in the intense first two years of the COVID-
19 pandemic. However, in 2022, early signs of a 
possible inflection point appeared, with greater 
volatility in the components of the global balance 
sheet and the first overall shrinkage in decades 
(Exhibit 1). 

The global balance sheet expanded inexorably 
from 2000 to the end of 2021. Real assets and 
net worth; financial assets and liabilities held 
by households, governments, and nonfinancial 
corporations; and financial assets and liabilities 
held by financial corporations each grew from 
about four to more than five times GDP. Global 
net worth was $610 trillion at the end of 2021. 
Only about one-fifth of wealth growth came from 
savers channeling money into new investment, 
with asset price inflation on the back of low 
interest rates contributing close to 80 percent. 
Correspondingly, liabilities and debt in China, 
Europe, Japan, and the United States were higher 
relative to GDP at the end of 2021 than at the time 
of the 2008 global financial crisis. For every dollar 
of net investment, $1.90 of additional debt was 
created outside the financial sector.

In this period, across countries, real estate, 
debt, and US equities drove most of the growth. 
While there were large differences among the 30 
countries covered in the magnitude, timing, and 
composition of growth in assets and liabilities, the 
direction of travel, the rapid expansion relative 
to GDP, and the strong role of real estate were 
near universal. Households particularly in Canada, 
Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the 
United States also experienced rapidly rising 
equity and pension wealth. Growth in debt relative 
to GDP was fastest in China, France, and Greece; 
relative to net investment, it was highest in 
Portugal, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom at 
factors of 4.1, 3.9, 3.8, and 3.8, respectively.

Growth in the global balance sheet accelerated 
during the pandemic. In 2020 and 2021, the 
intense first two years of the pandemic when 
governments launched large-scale support for 
economic activity, households globally added 
$100 trillion to global wealth “on paper” as asset 
prices soared and $39 trillion in new currency 
and deposits were minted. As a result, global 
wealth relative to GDP grew faster than in any 
other two-year period in the past nine decades. 
Debt and equity liabilities increased by about 
$50 trillion and $75 trillion, respectively, as 
governments and central banks stimulated 
economies. The creation of new debt accelerated 
to $3.40 for each $1.00 in net investment. 

Is 2022 a pause or an inflection point in the 
rise of the global balance sheet? In the face of 
geopolitical and economic turbulence, by the third 
quarter of 2022, all three interlocking balance 
sheets shrank relative to GDP for the first time 
in decades. As inflation and interest rates rose, 
global equity and bond prices declined by about 
30 and 20 percent in real terms, respectively. Real 
estate values grew more slowly than inflation and 
fell in nominal terms in several markets. Despite 
higher inflation, debt continued to grow slightly 
faster than GDP at par values (but declined in 
market values). 

What is next for the health and wealth of 
economies? Public- and private-sector leaders 
and financial authorities should consider closely 
monitoring and managing the balance sheet to 
achieve positive economic outcomes. The forces 
of secular stagnation could mean that after a 
brief intermezzo in 2022 and part of 2023, the 
balance sheet will resume its rise, adding to wealth 
but also to concerns about balance sheet health. 
Alternatively, the world could step up efforts to 
boost productivity growth and reallocate capital to 
productive capital formation in order to grow out 
of a supersize balance sheet. If the world does not 
go down either of these two routes, an unwinding 
of the balance sheet via inflation—as in the 1970s—
or via more sustained asset price corrections, 
deleveraging, and debt write-offs, as happened 
during the global financial crisis, may result.

The global balance sheet 
expanded inexorably in 
the Era of Markets 

In 2021, the McKinsey Global Institute employed a core tool used by companies—the balance 
sheet—as a way to gauge the underlying prosperity, health, and resilience of the global 
economy. We built a global balance sheet that complements GDP and other economic flows 
as a way of measuring the world’s wealth. This paper presents an update to the balance 
sheet through the pandemic (2020 and 2021) and the impact of war in Ukraine, inflation, and 
the interest rate shock in 2022. The balance sheet adds an important lens for assessing 
economic wealth and health (see Box 1, “The global balance sheet: Taking stock of economic 
health and wealth”).

McKinsey Global Institute  |  Global balance sheet 2022: Enter volatility Box 1
The global balance sheet: Taking stock of economic health and wealth 
A large balance sheet can be a sign of strength and wealth when it is underpinned by 
productive capital stock, but it can also expose fragilities when signs of asset price inflation 
and growing leverage are present (Exhibit 2). Notably, on the asset side, the balance sheet is 
a way to gauge overall wealth at the country and household levels, but also capital allocation 
and misallocation, and sources of wealth growth and whether they are sustainable or merely 
reflect asset price inflation. On the liability side, it provides a full account of debt and other 
financial liabilities at the economic sector level and supports analysis of stock and growth of 
liabilities in comparison with income growth, new capital formation, or asset price growth.

To construct a global balance sheet, MGI added up all real assets in the economy as well as 
all financial assets and liabilities, analogous to the way a corporation builds its balance sheet.1 
Included are all sectors—namely households, government, nonfinancial corporations (which 
include state-owned enterprises), and financial corporations (which include central banks). 
All assets and liabilities are valued at market prices.2 Human and environmental capital, and 
contingent liabilities, such as pay-as-you-go pension schemes, are excluded.

At a functional level, the global balance sheet has three components that interlock: (1) 
the real economy balance sheet: real assets and net worth; (2) the financial balance 
sheet: financial assets and liabilities held by households, governments, and nonfinancial 
corporations; and (3) the financial-sector balance sheet: financial assets and liabilities held by 
financial corporations. 

The real economy balance sheet has $620 trillion of real assets. About two-thirds of these are 
real estate (land and buildings), and one-third includes assets like machinery and equipment, 
infrastructure, natural resources, and intellectual property (IP). These are mirrored on 
the liability side as national or global net worth. Note that while for households, net worth 
includes both real assets such as property and financial assets like stocks and bonds, at the 
global or closed economy level, all financial assets are matched by corresponding liabilities so 
that net worth equates to the value of real assets (with a small deviation in MGI’s analysis due 
to the position of the rest of the world).

The financial balance sheet of households, nonfinancial corporations, and governments has 
$520 trillion in financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, pension funds, and cash and deposits 
that facilitate ownership and risk transfer of real assets as well as time shifting of savings 
and consumption. These financial assets balance against corresponding liabilities since they 
represent eventual claims that owners, namely those holding the asset, have on them. 

Finally, financial institutions create and intermediate those financial assets and liabilities—
with transformation of risks, maturity, and size—and hold $490 trillion in financial assets 
and corresponding liabilities. On the asset side, the largest contributor to the balance sheet 
of financial institutions is debt, followed by equity, currency and deposits (at other financial 
institutions or at central banks), and other financial assets such as derivatives and financial 
reserves. Among liabilities for financial institutions are currency and deposits, equity, 
and pensions.

(including Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Slovenia), China, Denmark, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, 
Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States. The global average is an extrapolation derived from a weighted average of 
30 countries (based on GDP) that account for 77 percent of global GDP.

dubbed the Era of Markets—the global balance sheet has risen inexorably.3 Between 2000 
and 2021, the market value of the three parts of the global balance sheet quadrupled, 
far outstripping growth in GDP.4 Historically, net worth (real and financial assets minus 
liabilities) accounted for four times GDP, but it reached more than six times GDP at the end of 
this period. 

Real assets and net worth rose to their highest levels relative to GDP since the two world wars, 
while liabilities and debt are now above the peaks reached around the global financial crisis. 
For every dollar of net investment, the financial system created $1.90 in additional debt.

Net worth expanded by 170 percentage points relative to 
GDP from pre-2000 averages, fueled by asset price inflation

 In recent decades, the world has experienced a sustained period of rising asset prices. 
Globally, net worth is now 170 percentage points higher relative to GDP than the pre-
2000 average, and by 2021 it had reached the highest level relative to GDP since before 
World War II (Exhibit 3). 

Only 23 percent of growth in the value of assets and net worth reflected savings channeled 
into net new investment that added to the productive or real capital stock of the economy. 
What really drove net worth growth was inflation in asset prices that far exceeded growth 
in consumer prices. Declining interest rates were a core driver. Particularly in real estate, 
lower financing costs meant that buyers were willing to pay higher property prices relative to 
prevailing rents. 

Real assets and net worth rose to their 
highest levels relative to GDP since the 
two world wars, while liabilities and 
debt are now above the peaks reached 
around the global financial crisis.

before the world wars in several economies

 The high ratio of wealth to GDP witnessed today—up to eight times in some countries—was 
also observed prior to World War I. For 50 years before the start of that war, the average 
wealth-to-income ratio of some of the world’s leading economies was relatively constant at 
levels comparable with, or higher than, today (Exhibit 4).5 

During the turbulent first half of the 20th century, two world wars and the Spanish flu 
pandemic severely disrupted global economies, reducing wealth to 30 percent of its average 
value relative to GDP from what it had been just a couple of decades earlier in countries such 
as France and Germany. Physical capital was destroyed. In Germany, hyperinflation also 
devalued financial assets and liabilities. Rapid industrialization changed the social fabric and 
engines of growth, and agricultural land lost its place as the primary store of value. 

After 1950, however, wealth-to-GDP ratios started growing again not only as the capital 
stock was built after the war but also as long-run asset prices recovered. More structurally, 
continued urban agglomeration, including the development of suburbs, as well as a shift to 
services contributed to real estate becoming a growing—and indeed primary—store of value.6 

The global trajectory accelerated in many economies in the late 1990s and around the turn of 
the millennium on the back of the “great moderation” characterized by declining interest rates 
and rising asset prices. Rapid income growth in superstar cities, whose supply of real estate 
is inelastic but which experience insatiable increases in demand, has added to real estate 
price pressures. 

Continued urban agglomeration, 
including the development of 
suburbs, as well as a shift to 
services contributed to real 
estate becoming a growing—and 
indeed primary—store of value.

 In the pre–World War I period, we use income instead of GDP.

Across countries, real estate and US 
equities drove asset growth

While the magnitude, exact timing, and composition of asset growth relative to GDP differed 
among countries, the direction of change and its underlying factors have been remarkably 
consistent across the globe in recent decades. 

The vast majority of countries have experienced rapidly growing net worth on the back 
of rising real estate values. These show up, in particular, on household balance sheets, 
benefiting homeowners but hurting those who seek property. South Korea, France, and New 
Zealand top the list of total and real estate net worth growth (Exhibit 5). Resource exporters 
including Australia, Canada, and Norway are also near the top of the list. These economies 
have benefited from rising resource wealth and have witnessed those funds pouring into 
real estate markets, boosting valuations (see Box 2, “Australia leads in household net worth 
relative to GDP due to high land prices”).

McKinsey Global Institute  |  Global balance sheet 2022: Enter volatility China has recorded some of the most rapid increases in real estate prices alongside its 
property boom. The country has experienced very significant GDP growth and a sizable 
expansion in other real assets, largely reflecting infrastructure, but also inventories of 
unfinished or unsold property. 

Japan experienced its peak before the collapse of its famous bubble in 1991 and has not 
fully recovered since. Many European economies have also experienced a rapid rise. In the 
United States, national net worth declined materially relative to GDP in the 1980s during a 
rapid monetary tightening cycle and the savings and loan crisis before rapidly rising again in 
the run-up to the global financial crisis. US household wealth rose much faster than national 
net worth and kept rising, also after the global financial crisis. The reason is that, in contrast 
to national wealth, household wealth includes equity assets, which rose rapidly in price, but 
excludes rising public and foreign debt. 

Only a limited number of countries experienced a contraction in net worth relative to GDP 
over the past two decades. Greece, Ireland, and Portugal all matched the global rise until 
the global financial crisis and subsequent eurozone crisis, which hit them hard. These crises 
turned previous real estate price increases into sharp declines, and large increases in public 
and foreign debt were needed to stabilize these economies. While Italy and Spain also 
experienced crises at this time, over the course of two decades their net worth still expanded 
relative to GDP.

In addition to property price growth, several economies, including Denmark, Finland, the 
Netherlands, and Norway, also experienced rapid expansion in their net international 
investment position. For Norway, this reflected its sovereign wealth fund. For Denmark 
and the Netherlands, it reflected their large pension systems, which each grew about 150 
percentage points faster than GDP. In Finland, the government and households increased 
their ownership of foreign mutual funds and equities. 

Looking at different sectors of the economy, countries including Japan, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States transferred large amounts of 
public wealth to households as they added public debt or privatized public assets.

Box 2
Australia leads in household net worth relative to GDP due to high 
land prices. 

 In household wealth, Australia topped the list in our sample at the end of 2021 at 7.1 times 
GDP—more than double the ratio in Finland, Norway, or Ireland—or about $396,000 
(Exhibit 6). Note that these are average levels, and there is large inequality among households. 

The value of land is the largest factor, ranging from well below one times GDP in countries like 
Finland and Mexico to almost four times GDP in Australia, Spain, and New Zealand. Canada, 
China, Denmark, Sweden, and the United States stand out for the largest value of household 
equity assets relative to GDP (where this includes nonlisted and owner-operator firms).7 
Pension assets are particularly large in Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States, countries where pension funds have been established as 
attractive (or mandatory) savings vehicles. In Japan, which has had decades of monetary 
stimulus and near-zero interest rates, households stand out for their large holdings of 
currency and deposits.

relative to GDP since 2000 and are now higher 
than before the global financial crisis 

From 2000 to 2021, global corporate equity liabilities—including those of privately held 
firms—rose by 101 percentage points relative to GDP to more than two times GDP. US equities 
were a primary driver. Notably, China has an even larger ratio of equity liabilities to GDP. 

Debt levels are also high by historical standards, exposing economies to the risks of higher 
debt service costs, deleveraging, and financial fragilities as interest rates rise. Since 2000, 
debt has grown by about $200 trillion globally, or by 74 percentage points relative to GDP 
(Exhibit 7).8

In the United States, debt relative to GDP has risen by about 95 percentage points since 
2000—approximately $45 trillion of additional debt—and is now higher than at its peak 
before the global financial crisis. Government debt grew by about 0.7 times GDP during this 
period, particularly in response to the financial crisis and the pandemic. Household debt has 
fallen from its peak relative to GDP, but it is still higher than in the early 2000s before the run-
up to the global financial crisis began. The same is true for financial corporations. 

In Europe (our sample includes 16 member states of the European Union plus the United 
Kingdom), the trajectory and level of total debt have been broadly similar to those of the 
United States. However, at the sector level, nonfinancial corporations have amassed a higher 
level of debt than in the United States, while households have been less leveraged relative to 
GDP (Exhibit 8). In China, debt growth took off after the global financial crisis. Nonfinancial 
corporations, which include state-owned enterprises (outside the financial sector), led the 
charge, but households also took on debt during a long-running property boom. In Japan, 
following the 1989 crisis, private-sector debt declined relative to GDP while public debt 
increased rapidly in repeated attempts to stabilize and stimulate the economy. 

While the direction of travel was universal, the amount of debt and broader financial liability 
growth relative to GDP varied widely (Exhibit 9). Growth in liabilities exceeded two times GDP 
in Canada, China, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. 

Looking only at debt outside the financial sector relative to GDP, growth was fastest in 
Greece, China, and France at 1.6, 1.5, and 1.3 times GDP, respectively. The ratio of net new 
debt for each dollar of net new investment exceeded a factor of three in Greece, Italy, 
Portugal, and the United Kingdom. 

Debt levels are also high by historical 
standards, exposing economies to 
the risks of higher debt service costs, 
deleveraging, and financial fragilities  
as interest rates rise.

8 

 A notable spike in 2020 partly reflected denominator effects as GDP contracted during the pandemic. These numbers 
exclude the debt liabilities of financial institutions—that is, the bonds they raise from other sectors—but not the debt 
securities they hold as assets; financial-sector debt is about 20 percent of total global debt at market value.

Growth in the global 
balance sheet accelerated 
during the pandemic

Growth in wealth and liabilities accelerated sharply in the intense first two years of the 
pandemic—between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021—as governments took large-
scale action to support economic activity. Looking at real assets and net worth, the global 
economy added $100 trillion to global wealth “on paper” as asset prices soared (Exhibit 10). 
As a result, global wealth relative to GDP grew faster than in any other two-year period in 
the past 88 years. Meanwhile, debt and equity liabilities increased by about $50 trillion and 
$75 trillion, respectively, as governments and central banks stimulated economies. New debt 
creation accelerated to $3.40 per dollar in net investment, and $39 trillion in new currency 
and deposits were created.

Asset price growth added $100 trillion 
to global wealth ‘on paper’

 During the first two years of the pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, the global balance sheet grew 
at 10 percent annually, compared with about 6 percent per year in the previous two decades. 

Household net worth grew by about $110 trillion, despite the humanitarian catastrophe and 
widespread economic hardship caused by the pandemic. While this could be regarded as a 
positive, the distribution is highly unequal, and the sustainability of this expansion has already 
been put to the test in 2022.9 Unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus contributed to 
accelerating growth in home prices, an equity market boom, and rising currency and deposit 
holdings—the mirror image of growing public debt and financial and central bank balance 
sheets. Household cash holdings grew by $19 trillion. House price indexes in major markets 
increased steadily during the first two years of the pandemic as mortgage rates reached 
new lows. The S&P 500 index rose by 16 percent in 2020 and 28 percent in 2021, amid rapid 
growth in valuations of digital economy firms as lockdowns shifted activities online. 

Across the other sectors of the economy, governments increased debt by $19 trillion at 
market values in an attempt to stabilize household and corporate income and balance sheets 
with instruments such as furlough programs, cash transfers, lost revenue compensation, and 
loan guarantees. Prices of mineral reserves also increased.

November 2021.

16

McKinsey Global Institute  |  Global balance sheet 2022: Enter volatility Nonfinancial corporations raised $15 trillion in new debt to weather the pandemic amid 
favorable financing conditions. Equity valuations, which for corporations sit on the liability 
side of the balance sheet, rose rapidly. On the asset side, while some commercial property 
like office and retail suffered at the beginning of the pandemic, net asset value bounced back 
in some markets by the end of 2020 and continued increasing toward the end of 2021.10 The 
value of inventory expanded by a total of $6.6 trillion. Companies invested in stockpiling as 
supply chains became less reliable—$4 trillion of this came from inventory growth among 
Chinese firms that included unfinished and unsold buildings. 

Financial corporations added $40 trillion in currency and deposits during the two pandemic 
years alone. Central banks rapidly expanded their balance sheets, injecting money into 
economies as part of stabilization programs during the crisis. Commercial banks added to 
money creation by providing more loans and by crediting the recipients of those loans with 
newly created cash deposits in return for the new loan obligations. 

Outside the financial sector, more than $3 of new debt was 
created for every $1 of net new investment in 2020 and 2021 

The world has experienced increased financial deepening. From 2000 to 2021, net new debt 
grew at 1.9 times the rate of net investment, and total financial liabilities, including equity, at 
3.8 times that rate—even before including the financial sector. In the first two years of the 
pandemic, for every dollar of net investment, liabilities grew by a staggering 7.3 times net 
new investment, of which $3.40 was net new debt outside the financial sector (Exhibit 11). 
Finance was seemingly used more for asset transactions at rising valuations than to fund new 
investment, although the exact links are difficult to parse. 

Real estate accelerated 
its rise relative to GDP, 
most notably in Australia, 
Austria, Canada, France, 
New Zealand, and Portugal.

The broad pattern of accelerated balance sheet growth held true across countries (Exhibit 12). 
Real estate accelerated its rise relative to GDP, most notably in Australia, Austria, Canada, 
France, New Zealand, and Portugal. Equity assets (and corresponding liabilities) grew more 
than real estate in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United States. Debt grew most rapidly 
in Canada, France, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Spain, and the United States.

Is 2022 a pause or an 
inflection point in the rise 
of the global balance sheet? 

Rising rates and inflation in the first three quarters of 2022 led to volatility and a pause in 
the multidecade rise of the global balance sheet. In the face of geopolitical and economic 
turbulence, notably rising inflation and interest rates and declining asset prices, over those 
quarters, all three interlocking global balance sheets shrank relative to GDP for the first time 
since the global financial crisis. 

20

McKinsey Global Institute  |  Global balance sheet 2022: Enter volatility Several factors that drove sustained balance 
sheet expansion have turned (for now) 

Significant changes in key macroeconomic indicators occurred in the first three quarters 
of 2022 (Exhibit 13). In the third quarter of 2022, global interest rates increased by three 
percentage points, which is the highest year-on-year increase in more than 40 years. Inflation 
also reached heights last seen in 1982, with an annual increase of 7 percent. Equities and 
debt also decreased sharply, as leading equity market indexes fell 30 percent in real terms, 
the second-greatest decrease since 1980, behind only the global financial crisis in 2008. 
Major bond indexes dropped 19 percent and ended the third quarter of 2022 notably lower 
than at any other point in the past two decades. Housing prices turned sharply, declining 
for the first time in ten years by one percentage point after an 8 percent increase in the 
previous year.

In the first three quarters of 2022, the global balance sheet 
declined for the first time since the global financial crisis

As the inflation and interest rate shock unfolded, investors became more wary of debt, real 
estate prices leveled off, and the valuation of equity and debt securities declined. By the 
third quarter of 2022, the global balance sheet had registered a decline of about $20 trillion 
in financial assets and liabilities outside the financial sector (Exhibit 14). Note that while the 
market value of (mostly government and corporate) debt declined by 8 percent (excluding 
financial corporations) as interest rates rose, at par values, debt on the global balance sheet 
kept expanding by 0.2 times GDP. 

The balance sheet declined relative to GDP, due to decreases in equities, debt securities, and 
real estate (in some countries), versus a nominal growth in GDP driven by high inflation rates 
during 2022. The financial system and financial-sector balance sheets contracted by about 
40 and 30 percentage points of GDP, respectively, during the first three quarters of 2022. Net 
worth fell by 10 percentage points of GDP.

As the inflation and interest rate shock 
unfolded, investors became more wary 
of debt, real estate prices leveled off,  
and the valuation of equity and 
debt securities declined.

to equities based on global benchmarks. 4Debt securities were assumed to grow in line with Q4 2021 to Q2 2022 trend vs GDP; for countries with missing 2022 debt 
securities data, average of decline trend in other countries vis-à-vis average GDP growth was applied as a proxy, except for the United States, where market value of 
federal debt to Q3 2022 was used for government; Vanguard Total Bond Market Index was used for US financial corporations. For China, bond securities were assumed to

and net worth in Australia and Sweden felt the most impact

While broad patterns in the global balance sheet were consistent in 2022, the magnitude 
of change differed across countries (Exhibit 15). Australia, Canada, and Sweden, where 
real estate markets had long been considered to be “overheated,” experienced the largest 
declines in real estate worth relative to nominal GDP. By contrast, rising mineral prices 
contributed to positive change in net worth in Australia (alongside infrastructure and 
machinery) and Canada.

What is next for economic 
health and wealth? 

Scenarios, which will be fleshed out and fully analyzed in a new paper in 2023, suggest four 
different directions for the relation of the balance sheet to GDP and thus economic health and 
wealth in the period to 2030 (Exhibit 16).

McKinsey Global Institute  |  Global balance sheet 2022: Enter volatility The following pathways are possible with potential for  different economies to take 
differing paths:

1.  The rise resumes. In this scenario, inflation proves to be transitory and global saving 
and aging effects return real interest rates, inflation, and real GDP growth to very low 
levels; secular stagnation continues. In this scenario, a savings glut is stymied by a lack 
of attractive investment opportunities and is therefore channeled into existing assets, 
boosting the values of equity and real estate. Low interest rates encourage further growth 
in debt. Wealth keeps growing “on paper,” and so do leverage and balance sheet risk, as 
we have experienced in recent decades.

2.  Productivity acceleration. In this scenario, the world economy experiences a persistent 
acceleration in productivity growth and a reallocation of funds to productive investment. 
In this scenario, the benefits of rapid digitization and technological advances would, at 
last, show in GDP growth; energy system reconfiguration would not only lead to greener 
and more secure but also, eventually, cheaper energy; and policy changes would help 
unleash investment in areas like future mobility and affordable housing. Macro-prudential 
policy helps contain further debt and asset price growth, and global GDP growth 
outpaces balance sheet growth. Such productivity acceleration was visible in the United 
States in the late 1990s, although the balance sheet was much smaller then.

3.  Inflationary way out. In this scenario, inflationary pressures become entrenched, as high 
energy prices continue to cascade through the economy; labor market shortages persist, 
not least due to demographic shifts; expectations become unanchored; and the velocity 
of money grows. Wages grow faster than productivity, and corporate pricing power allows 
companies to pass cost increases on to consumers. Central banks would intervene with 
higher rates, but not enough to get inflation back below 2 percent, as they face financial 
stability risks, distributional issues, and weak growth. This leads to a decline in the ratio of 
the global balance sheet to GDP as high inflation leads to fast nominal GDP growth while 
monetary tightening limits asset price growth and debt formation. This scenario would 
have some parallels with the 1970s stagflation era. 

4.  Asset price correction and deleveraging. In this scenario, central banks battle high 

inflation with sharply higher interest rates. Highly leveraged sectors—starting with the 
public sector—tighten belts and attempt to reduce debt burdens, muting growth. Asset 
prices contract given high interest rates, rising risk premiums and a dampened growth 
outlook. Where debt service costs become too large and assets are underwater (that 
is, their value is lower than the debt held against them), defaults and write-offs or even 
a financial crisis potentially unfold. This scenario could unfold somewhat in combination 
with the inflationary way out. It would be somewhat similar to what happened during the 
tightening cycle in the United States in the 1980s (although the balance sheet was much 
smaller then) or after the global financial crisis of 2008.

Significant variation in scenarios and pathways should be expected for different economic 
regions that have dissimilar starting points, trajectories, and macroeconomic parameters. For 
instance, the United States has particularly large balance sheet positions in equity and public 
debt, and a macroeconomic environment of high inflation and rapid central bank tightening. 
The eurozone has relatively high public debt and real estate values, coupled with high inflation 
and, so far, less central bank tightening than in the United States. China has a large balance 
sheet in real estate and property debt. 

The different scenarios that may unfold over the next ten years will have different implications 
for households, governments, and corporations. Will net worth continue to grow faster than 
GDP, continuing the expansion in the balance sheet observed over the past 20 years, or will 
productivity catch-up bridge the gap and power growth in the real economy? Many questions 
remain to be resolved.

Pixels of Progress: A granular look at human 
development around the world (December 2022)

Our world is big and complex, but human progress 
is still about life on the ground, up close and in 
detail. This report shares findings from a new 
dataset that breaks the world down into more than 
40,000 microregions.

Global flows: The ties that bind in an 
interconnected world (November 2022)

Economic and political turbulence has prompted 
speculation that the world is already deglobalizing. 
But the evidence suggests that global integration is 
here to stay, albeit with nuance. 

On the cusp of a new era? (October 2022)

Current economic and political turbulence could 
presage the start of a new era that is structurally 
very different, with a new narrative of progress.

The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what 
it could bring (January 2022) 

Governments and companies worldwide are 
pledging to achieve net-zero emissions of 
greenhouse gases. The report looks at the economic 
transformation that the transition would entail, 
estimating the changes in demand, capital spending, 
costs, and jobs for sectors that produce about 
85 percent of overall emissions and assessing 
economic shifts for 69 countries.

The rise and rise of the global balance sheet:

of net worth, even as economies turn digital and 
intangible.

Getting tangible about intangibles: The future of 
growth and productivity? (June 2021) 

Could investment in intangible assets breathe

correlation between intangibles investment and the 
performance of sectors, economies, and firms, and 
examines ways intangible assets can be deployed 
effectively to drive growth.
