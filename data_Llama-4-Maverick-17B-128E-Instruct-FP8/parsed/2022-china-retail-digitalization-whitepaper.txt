2022 China Retail 
Digitalization Whitepaper
The next frontier of digital transformation in China’s 
retail industry

September 2022

Executive 
summary

As China wrestles with macro-economic 
uncertainty amid persistent outbreaks of 
COVID-19, retailers are under increasing 
pressure to adapt to slowing sales growth 
and heightened competitive intensity. 

McKinsey research conducted in 
partnership with the China Chain Store 
& Franchise Association suggests that, 
despite significant investment in omni-
channel expansion, retailers are struggling 
to turn a strategic focus on digital into 
improved financial performance. 

This white paper provides a compelling 
snapshot of China’s retail market and 
essential guidance for executives seeking 
to navigate the next phase of growth by 
implementing digital transformations. Key 
takeaways include: 

 — A majority (85 percent) of retailers 
have not fully realized the benefits 
of investing in digital, and are caught 
between expanding online operations 
and implementing ‘digital intelligence’ 
initiatives. 

 — Most retailers are focused on building 

front-end digital capacity. Digitalizing the 
mid and back-end of the value chain, or 
core business modules and back office 
infrastructure, remains a challenge. 

 — Driving return on investment is proving 
problematic. While many retailers have 
invested heavily in digital transformation 
and appointed C-suite executives to lead 
the process, fewer than half expect to 
recoup their costs within three years.

 — Two-thirds of retailers believe that 

redesigning organizational structure 
and operating models to support digital 
transformation is one of three keys to 
successful digitalization.

 — Implementing organizational change is 
difficult and slows down the process; 
more than half of retail executives lack 
a clear plan for what they are trying to 
achieve, not to mention the digital talent 
necessary to implement change. 

 — Four trends are reshaping Chinese retail: 
The potential for digital transformation 
to improve efficiency is expanding as 
market growth slows; the era of the 
online ‘traffic dividend’ has ended, 
demanding greater effort to attract and 
retain customers; retailers are intently 
focused on merchandise quality to drive 
sales; and stores are embracing more 
diverse roles as they turn into experience 
and online fufillment centers. 

 — Each type of retail format, ranging 

from hypermarkets to supermarkets, 
convenience stores, shopping malls, 
and specialty stores, faces market 
challenges that can be addressed 
through targeted digital interventions. 
This paper provides a breakdown of 
the challenges in each segment and 
examples of digital initiatives that can 
best address them. 

 — Successful retail digital transformations 
are united in requiring four key enablers 
to be implemented in tandem: a 
multifaceted ‘middle office’, a complete 
cultural, organizational, and mindset 
shift, the implementation of artificial 
intelligence at scale, and the deployment 
of affordable in-store technology that 
serves as a data source for new digital 
initiatives.

Preface 

Over the past decade, China’s retail industry 
has weathered seismic disruptions triggered 
by near ubiquitous smartphone ownership. 
Mobile commerce has surged, spurring the 
rise of the ‘new retail’ concept that blends 
offline and digital commerce. More recently, 
the onset of COVID-19 has accelerated 
the adoption of new retail technologies 
and online channels have flourished and 
fragmented. 

Encouraged by the digital shift, China’s 
Internet firms have stepped into retail and 
now vie for market share against offline 
incumbents. Retailers of both types 
recognize that the nature of their industry 
has changed forever, and are remolding 
their operations through digitalization – the 
reorganization of business activities around 
digital technologies. 

But a narrow emphasis on omni-channel 
expansion has succeeded only in 
depressing retail profits without achieving 
significant earnings growth. The true 
benefits of digital transformation have 
yet to be realized. Awareness is growing 
among retail executives that successful 
digitalization is not merely about expanding 
online channels, but rather requires a 
fundamental transformation so that digital 
thinking and technology work in concert 
across business units. 

Meanwhile, the latest indicators suggest 
that the global macro-economic 
environment is entering a period of deep 
turbulence, and China is no exception. 
Persistent outbreaks of COVID-19 continue 
to hold back China’s GDP growth, weighing 
on consumption spending and retail 

revenues, and shaping consumer behavior. 

Market participants are racing to convert 
existing digital investments into top 
and bottom-line breakthroughs before 
commercial pressures take their toll. In 
our view, the uncertainty presents both a 
challenge and an opportunity for Chinese 
retailers intent on completing their 
digitalization journey.

This "2022 China Retail Digitalization White 
Paper", jointly published by McKinsey 
and the China Chain Store & Franchise 
Association (CCFA), aims to assist retail 
executives in putting digital at the heart of 
their corporate structure and culture, data 
collection and storage, operating principles, 
and technology. 

We present new research on the current 
state of digitalization among China’s 
retailers and an analysis of four major 
trends reshaping Chinese retail. We also 
provide a breakdown of the challenges 
affecting hypermarkets, convenience 
stores, shopping malls, and specialty stores 
– and suggest digital solutions to overcome 
them. Finally, we conduct a deep-dive into 
the key enablers of a successful digital 
transformation: middle office development, 
digital organization, artificial intelligence (AI) 
at scale, and in-store technology. We focus 
on areas in which these changes can make 
the most impact – the essential elements of 
retail success: product strength, consumer 
experience, and supply chain efficiency.

The "2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper" is jointly developed by 
McKinsey China and China Chain Store and Franchise Association (CCFA) for 
industry reference.

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperWe conducted in-depth interviews with 
business leaders from more than 20 retail 
companies and delivered questionnaires to 
C-suite executives at nearly 40 domestic 
retailers. Our research divided the 
digitalization process into four stages:

Digitalization 1.0: Informatization: This 
includes IT infrastructure upgrades and 
transformation, as well as business process 
systematization and informatization.

Digitalization 2.0: Online operations: 
Comprising online channel expansion to 
achieve omni-channel operations, and 
leveraging data insights to assist business 
decision making.

Digitalization 3.0: Digital intelligence: 
This refers to applying big data analysis to 
drive decision making across the business, 
automating processes and decisions, and 

implementing cost reduction and efficiency 
improvements on a large scale.

Digitalization 4.0: Platform-based 
operations and ecosystem building: 
Covering the integration of industries or 
value chains, development of a digital 
business ecosystem, and the promotion and 
empowerment of data-driven new business 
models and industries.

Our research suggests that retailers 
are exploring online operations 
(Digitalization 2.0) and moving towards 
digital intelligence (Digitalization 3.0) 
in terms of their digital transformation 
journey. Interviews we conducted support 
this finding: 85 percent of Chinese retailers 
are poised somewhere between the online 
operations and digital intelligence stages of 
digitalization (Exhibit 1).

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperMost retailers are still focused on building 
out front-end digital capacity and traffic 
operations. Currently, retail enterprises 
remain intent on developing digital direct-
to-consumer capabilities. Digitalizing the 

mid and back-end of the value chain, or 
core business modules and back office 
infrastructure, remains a challenge, 
according to our research (Exhibit 2).

Retailers have chosen digital 
transformation as a key strategic focus, 
and are investing heavily to achieve their 
aims. Our survey suggests the majority of 
retailers are adopting digital transformation 
as a key strategic direction for their future 
development, and are investing more than 

3 percent of total revenue on digital. Some 
respondents indicated they are committing 
as much as 10 percent of revenue to their 
digitalization program. While they expect 
significant returns in terms of business 
performance, the return on that investment 
is not yet clear (Exhibits 3 and 4).

difficulties redesigning their 
organizational structure and talent 
acquisition processes to drive digital 
transformation. Two-thirds of retailers 
believe that redesigning organizational 
structure and operational models to 
support digital transformation is one of 

three keys to successfully implementing the 
process. In reality, advancing organizational 
change is difficult and slows down digital 
transformation; more than half lack a clear 
plan for what they are trying to achieve, not 
to mention the digital talent necessary to 
implement change (Exhibit 5).

Clearly, Chinese retailers have a way to go 
to complete their digital transformation. 
In the following sections, we analyze 
the digital transformation processes 
of supermarkets and hypermarkets, 
convenience stores (CVS), shopping malls, 

and specialty stores, before extrapolating 
best practices and sharing insights into how 
China’s retail players can best advance the 
digitalization process.

Four trends reshaping 
Chinese retail

8

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperDeep-dive research across multiple regions 
and channels unearthed four trends that are 
redefining China’s retail market. Based on 
these trends, we identify four main insights 
for retail enterprises:

1.  The scope of digital transformation 
is widening as market growth slows

     As retail growth eases and profits 

decline (Exhibit 6), digital transformation 
is evolving beyond channel expansion 
to encompass leaner store operations 
across both merchandise and the supply 
chain to reduce costs and improve 
efficiency.

     Supermarkets and hypermarkets’ 
profits have significantly declined 
amid a surge in store closures in the 
past year, placing them at a survival 
inflection point. In 2021, most listed 
supermarkets and hypermarkets saw 
year-on-year revenues and profits 
decrease. 

2.  The ‘traffic dividend’ era has 

concluded 

     Early digital adopters no longer benefit 
from the shift of consumer traffic to 

online channels, and it is no longer 
sustainable to issue discounts to lock-in 
long-term customers. With the migration 
to online now fully complete, retailers are 
turning their attention to improving core 
competitiveness in order to retain existing 
customers and attract new ones. Refining 
omni-channel and user operations is now 
essential for retail enterprises to monetize 
traffic. 

     As traffic dividends disappear, online 
platforms are competing for users 
with increasing intensity. According to 

9

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaperthe China Internet Network Information 
Center (CNNIC), Internet penetration 
hit 72 percent in 2021, approaching 
saturation when viewed in light of 
a national urbanization level of 64 
percent. Acquiring public domain traffic 
is increasingly expensive, which has 
elevated Internet-based platforms’ user 
operation costs. For example, Alibaba’s 
e-commerce user operation costs 
increased by nearly 88 percent from 2017 
to 2020.

     Brick-and-mortar store traffic is 

trending downward under the impact 
of COVID-19 and traffic diversion to 
e-commerce and door-to-door (D2D) 
services. Previous McKinsey research 
shows that foot traffic in retail stores had 
not recovered to pre-COVID levels two 
months after the peak of the pandemic 
in 2020, with supermarkets and CVS 
experiencing a 20 percent and 12 percent 
drop, respectively. COVID-19 flare-ups 
in multiple provinces and cities since the 
beginning of 2022 have continued to hit 
offline stores. 

     Customer touchpoints and shopping 

channels have fragmented both online 
and offline, making it more complicated 
for retailers to manage traffic domains. 
Retailers need to not only manage online 
communities, WeChat official accounts, 
and WeChat enterprise accounts in 
private domains, but also create strategies 
for social platforms (such as Xiaohongshu) 
and short video livestreaming platforms 
(e.g. Douyin and Kuaishou).

     User growth has plateaued, making 
the management of existing users 
more important. Retail enterprises 
should build an omni-channel and refined 
user management system. According 
to McKinsey’s China consumer survey, 
conducted in mid-2022, more than 89 

percent of consumers changed their 
shopping habits in the past year, by 
trying new shopping apps and social 
e-commerce channels, or changing the 
stores where they normally shop. As 
consumers become less loyal, retailers are 
having to widen their channel offerings 
and go to greater lengths to retain 
customers. 

3.  Retailers are refocusing on 

merchandise and doubling-down 
on quality

     As consumers make more rational and 
individualized choices, retailers need to 
emphasize product strengths to meet 
their needs. McKinsey’s 2022 Global 
Consumer Sentiment Survey shows that 
consumption upgrades and downgrades 
are happening concurrently in the Chinese 
grocery market. Retailers thus face both a 
challenge and an opportunity around the 
need to accurately match customer needs 
with merchandise at the individual level. 

     Merchandise competitiveness depends 

on whether retailers can work out detailed 
assortment and pricing strategies for 
different customer groups. On the other 
hand, competitiveness also relies on 
their ability to innovate and differentiate 
merchandise by developing own-brand 
products, while keeping abreast of market 
trends and iterating products. 

4.  Retail stores are embracing 

multiple roles 

     Retail outlets are no longer just shopping 
channels but instead serve as venues for 
user experiences and operations. Such 
customer-centric operations, including 
content creation and delivery, campaign 
organization, and lead retention and 
conversion, are crucial to deepening the 
bond between a brand and its customers. 

10

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaperiii.  ‘Last mile’ delivery: A favorable layout, 
front- and back-warehouse planning, as 
well as order-pickup area design, can 
play a key role in improving the efficiency 
and reducing the costs of ‘last mile’ 
delivery.

iv.   Delivering value-added services: 

Shop-floor staff not only serve as the 
human point of connection between 
the enterprise and consumers, but are 
also vital for additional service delivery. 
For shopping malls and specialty stores 
(cosmetics, pharmacies, and mother 
and baby stores), frontline workers and 
shopping assistants play a crucial role in 
driving uptake of additional services.

Stores also serve as sources of instant 
delivery and as fulfillment centers. 
Retailers urgently need to upgrade the 
management of stores and frontline 
personnel through digital transformation 
in order to cater to the following fast-
evolving roles:

i.  Hosting consumer experiences: 

According to McKinsey research, 85 
percent of consumers prefer to make a 
purchase decision in offline stores. No 
matter whether they choose to experience 
and evaluate goods at stores before 
buying elsewhere, or they buy directly 
in stores, their preference attests to the 
importance of creating a good shopping 
experience at offline stores.

ii.  Omni-channel user operations: Stores 
can foster a sense of community that will 
increase the visit frequency and loyalty 
of customers by providing convenient 
and user-friendly services and facilities. 
For example, CVS can offer eating areas, 
collection and delivery of parcels and 
group purchases, as well as bill-payment 
services.

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper3.1 Hypermarkets and 
supermarkets:  
Omni-channel answers 
to a triple threat

In the following section, we identify threats 
facing hypermarkets and supermarkets1 and 
present thoughts on how to leverage digital 
to address them.

Hypermarkets experienced flat growth 
in the past year, while supermarkets 
experienced pressure on both revenues and 
profits (Exhibit 7).

I.  Consumer fragmentation, low 

profitability, and rising costs are 
major challenges

For traditional hypermarkets and 
supermarkets in China, disruptive 
transformation is imperative amid 
flatlining growth: In 2021, China’s 
hypermarket and supermarket footprint 
totaled RMB 3 trillion, but the market 
recorded sluggish growth overall. 

Moreover, these topline numbers 
obscure a pernicious threat to traditional 
supermarkets revealed by recent McKinsey 
surveys in China, namely that they are 
struggling to address the triple challenges 
of consumer base fragmentation, 
profitability issues in their online business, 
and rising operating costs. Below we 
explore solutions for each of the three 
challenges in turn: 

1      Hypermarkets in China are retail outlets with a commercial space of over 5,000sqm that primarily sell food, beverages, tobacco, and 

other groceries. Hypermarkets also sell a range of non-grocery merchandise and typically have upwards of 10,000 stock keeping units 
(SKUs). Supermarkets are smaller, defined as selling groceries in a selling space of between 400-3000sqm, excluding discounters, CVS 
and independent grocery stores. They primarily sell food groceries and carry about 8-10,000 SKUs.

1: The consumer base is fragmenting 
amid weak value propositions and a 
plethora of alternatives 

The grocery market is among the most 
complicated and fast-growing in China in 
terms of the competitive landscape and 
pace of innovation. On the demand side, 
the market is trending towards polarized 
consumption where trading up and down is 
commonplace, hyper-convenience, and an 

expanding number of purchasing scenarios. 
On the supply side, the challenges revolve 
around responding to group buying and 
e-commerce platforms’ cost and quality 
advantages, as well as a failure to upgrade 
brick-and-mortar stores’ stock-keeping 
arrangements and layouts (Exhibit 8).

On the demand side, hypermarkets and 
supermarkets are struggling to respond 
to three seismic shifts in consumer 
preferences and market competition: 

Polarized consumption: On the one hand, 
consumers are increasingly seeking the 
most cost-efficient daily necessities; on 
the other hand, they are prepared to pay a 
high premium for products with which they 
have a strong emotional connection or that 
command a brand premium. For example, 
14 percent of Chinese consumers are 
trading up when buying alcohol and beauty 
products, whereas 17 percent of consumers 
are trading down for daily necessities and 
white goods.

Heightened demand for hyper-
convenience: Previously, consumers 
would walk or take a half-hour bus ride to 
hypermarkets, but now they prefer to shop 
nearby, or buy online for home delivery. 

Diversified purchasing occasions: 
Like the wider retail market, grocery 
consumption has splintered across multiple 
purchase scenarios, covering one-stop 
stockpiling, spur of the moment purchasing 
in-store and via home delivery, and routine 
shopping. This places greater pressure on 
hypermarkets and supermarkets to adapt 
by engaging consumers through  
omni-channel.  

15

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperOn the supply side, hypermarket and 
supermarkets’ value proposition has 
become unclear, making it difficult to 
survive competition with other businesses 
that outperform them in several areas, 
including:  

Convenience and timeliness: Traditional 
hypermarkets and supermarkets mostly 
serve ‘planned’ in-store purchases. Thus, 
it is difficult to withstand competition 
from new retail enterprises that are better 
equipped to respond to rising consumer 
demand for flexibility and speed in terms of 
purchasing products.

Cost performance: Traditional 
hypermarkets and supermarkets struggle 
to compete with community-based group 
buying and integrated e-commerce 
platforms in terms of online order fulfillment 
costs. Mainstream integrated e-commerce 
platforms have also had a considerable 
impact on offline supermarkets by offering 
lower prices in standard categories like 
packaged snacks, mother and baby 
products, toiletries, and household cleaning 
products. Fresh products, an important 
source of foot traffic in supermarkets, have 
been disrupted by group buying – for some 
products, the group buying price is 15-25 
percent lower compared with supermarkets. 

Product strengths: Although hypermarkets 
and supermarkets are positioned to 
provide a full range of products, their 
product range and quality are inferior when 
compared with integrated e-commerce 
platforms. Outdated assortments and 
mediocre product selection are increasingly 
prominent problems. 

Service and experience: Some regional 
hypermarkets and supermarkets in lower-
tier cities still depend heavily on manual 
cash registers, resulting in long waiting 
times and a poor experience. Some stores’ 
spatial arrangement, traffic flow planning, 

and shelf allocation are not consumer-
friendly, which also weakens the shopping 
experience.

2: Omni-channel expansion is 
accelerating, but D2D business 
profitability is a concern 

Door-to-door (D2D) service, an important 
omni-channel business for fresh products, 
currently relies on subsidies for growth. 
Even leading traditional hypermarkets are 
operating at a loss or earning low profits 
due to high fulfillment costs. Indeed, for 
traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets, 
D2D business contributes to growth rather 
than to profits, with many participants 
reporting that the more products they 
sell, the more money they lose. Even for 
industry leaders, new stores (open for 
less than six months) are suffering a loss 
in earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) 
of 10-15 percent. Therefore, D2D order 
growth actually lowers hypermarket and 
supermarket profitability. 

3: Operating costs continue to rise

Supermarkets and hypermarkets’ single-
store sales are on the decline, while 
single-store costs such as those for rent, 
renovations, labor, and utilities keep rising. 
This further depresses profit margins. 
According to statistics from Chinese 
economic data source CEIC, the average 
salary in China’s wholesale and retail 
industry increased by 30 percent in 2020 
compared with 2017. Furthermore, spending 
on protective and disinfectant supplies 
for employees and stores amid COVID-19 
outbreaks increased the cost burden on 
supermarkets and hypermarkets. Finally, 
these stores previously possessed an 
advantage in attracting foot traffic, and 
could obtain favorable rental terms from 
commercial property companies, which 
viewed their presence as a boon for their 
overall portfolio. However, a rise in rental 

16

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepapersmaller stores allow for improved cost 
control across procurement, warehousing, 
logistics, store operation, and rents. 

Developing multiple formats and 
banners: By pursuing multi-brand and 
multi-format development,  grocers can 
create differentiated value propositions to 
meet divergent consumer demands. 

2: Deploy user operations across all 
channels to maximize customer value 
The first step to grow sales and profits is to 
increase average transaction value (ATV) 
and units per transaction (UPT) through 
deploying omni-channel, and refining 
user operations. Companies should aim 
to complete transformation in these areas 
before optimizing costs, because the value 
of omni-channel users is significantly higher 
than that of single-channel users in terms 
of ATV and purchase frequency. According 
to the D2D business data of leading chain 
supermarkets in China, the average annual 
spending of omni-channel users is 30 
percent higher than that of single-channel 
users. Supermarkets should improve user 
operations capabilities through digital 
operations to help achieve the following 
aims: 

i.   Deliver a tailored, data-driven and 

segmented operations strategy: For 
example, a leading new retailer divides 
its customers into several tiers based on 
purchase frequency and monitors daily 
expenditure allocation and conversion in 
each tier. This allows the retailer to map 
out user operations strategies targeting 
customers in each segment, such as 
offering coupons to regular customers 
who refer new ones to offline stores.

costs appears inevitable as store leases 
expire, and as foot traffic has declined amid 
the proliferation of alternative purchasing 
models.

II.  Digital transformation for 

hypermarkets and supermarkets: 
5 initiatives for successful omni-
channel growth

The points above illustrate a challenging 
status quo for traditional supermarkets. In 
the following section, we explore five ways 
in which hypermarkets and supermarkets 
can tap various digitalization benefits to 
address these issues, and turn their omni-
channel expansion from a cost center into a 
profit driver.

1: Differentiate online and offline 
business value propositions to stand 
out from the market
We have seen various players transform 
and revitalize their value propositions with 
positive results, and believe that a mature 
value proposition should be differentiated in 
at least one dimension. Here are some key 
points to consider when reevaluating value 
propositions: 

Improving timeliness and convenience 
through omni-channel fulfillment is 
essential. Hypermarkets and supermarkets 
should provide flexible delivery options to 
meet consumers’ needs, such as 30-minute 
delivery, as well as next-day deliveries in a 
designated time slot, and deliveries several 
days later.

Smaller store formats and refined 
SKUs improve product strength and 
experience. As a legacy of their role 
catering for one-stop shoppers, traditional 
hypermarkets and supermarkets cover a 
huge area and have a large number of SKUs. 
As a result, these retailers struggle to afford 
high rents when foot traffic decreases. 
Simplified, narrower SKUs applicable to 

17

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperEnhance upstream control along the 
fresh product supply chain, and explore 
key product categories in depth: 
Supermarkets can enhance upstream 
control by moving into direct procurement 
and setting up warehouses and processing 
centers at product source in order to build 
differentiated and exclusive advantages in 
supply.

Tap into private-brand value through 
consumer insights: Leading new retailers 
are able to leverage massive real-time 
consumption data to quickly understand 
consumer demand and support the 
development of private-brand products. 
After launching new products, they collect 
consumer feedback and retain only the 
most suitable seasonal products, while 
optimizing staples. Meanwhile, they can 
observe and respond to dynamic consumer 
trends, opening potential to deliver 
bestselling private-brand products.

Adopt data-driven intelligent product 
selection: Currently, the intelligent 
product selection model combines 
manual operations and algorithms. An 
experienced product selection team makes 
an algorithm model and refines it based on 
customer insights and store data, thereby 
determining the product portfolio. In future, 
algorithm models will likely surpass human 
decision-making, further improving product 
selection and decision-making quality and 
responsiveness.

ii.  Achieve the following user operations-

enabled goals:

Attract new customers: For traditional 
hypermarkets and supermarkets, leveraging 
offline store traffic is conducive to rapidly 
growing D2D business in the initial 
stage. However, given the traffic growth 
bottleneck this strategy entails, retailers still 
need to place ads on new media and social 
platforms to drive additional referral traffic.

Increase ATV: Hypermarkets and 
supermarkets can utilize large consumption 
data sets to analyze customer behavior 
and recommend suitable products, points 
redemption ideas at checkout, price-
break discounts or gifts, and ways to get 
free shipping when customers make a 
purchasing decision, thereby elevating ATV 
and transaction volume.

Stimulate repurchases and improve 
customer loyalty: Social media-based 
community operations, especially 
WeChat groups, are an effective means 
for hypermarkets and supermarkets to 
establish a customer community, develop 
loyal customers, and form a closed loop of 
traffic.

3: Elevate the appeal of stores and 
products
Powerful merchandising is a natural weapon 
in the battle to attract new customers and 
improve customer loyalty, especially for 
popular fresh products. It is not sustainable 
for hypermarkets and supermarkets to 
drive customer growth solely by issuing 
shopping subsidies; customer retention 
ultimately depends on the competitive 
edge of their merchandise. Hypermarkets 
and supermarkets can strengthen their 
merchandise management capabilities 
through digital transformation initiatives by 
doing the following:

18

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper4: Reduce store operating costs in key 
business areas
Hypermarkets and supermarkets should aim 
to leverage digitalization to markedly lower 
store operating costs, aiming to address the 
following areas as a priority:   

i.  Refining fresh product operations to 

reduce losses

Consumers frequently purchase fresh food 
and this drives foot traffic to hypermarkets 
and supermarkets. However, fresh food is 
burdened by low gross profit margins, short 
expiry dates, as well as high handling losses, 
all of which weigh on profitability. As such, 
hypermarkets and supermarkets should 
prioritize refining operations in the segment 
through digital transformation across the 
stocking, sales, and storage process, so as to 
increase shelf sales and reduce losses. Some 
examples include:

Sales volume forecasts and order 
suggestions: These leverage algorithmic 
data on store locations and surrounding 
populations to measure the ‘penetration 
rate’ of each category (such as the number 
of surrounding customer groups that need 
to buy green leafy vegetables), and generate 
ordering suggestions. In this way, store sales 
volume can be predicted more accurately, and 
at the same time, stockouts and the capital 
occupation and waste caused by overordering 
can be avoided.

Digitalized product ratings and quality 
management: Each store evaluates product 
quality via a store clerk app when receiving 
goods. Fresh products can be graded so as to 
carry out subsequent pricing and assortment 
operations, and products can be discounted 
immediately to accelerate turnover. This 
ensures that consumers’ shopping experience 
is maintained, while avoiding slow-sale losses. 
Over the longer term, persistent product 
quality problems can be referred back to the 

purchasing team to intervene on quality 
control.

Sales progress monitoring: The system 
automatically analyzes fresh food sales. If 
progress is too slow, it will arrange limited 
promotions to reduce the stock of unsold 
goods left over after peak sales periods.

Promotion optimization: Algorithms select 
which items to put in the promotion area 
(such as on the end shelf), to maximize the 
efficient use of space, speed up product 
turnover, reduce losses, and improve capital 
utilization. The algorithm covers indicators 
such as whether the product is in season, 
past customer coverage and acceptance 
(products that are too niche are not suitable 
for promotion), consumer price sensitivity, 
and other indicators. It then deploys a multi-
dimensional scoring system that allows 
for a one-vote veto of key factors such as 
low gross profit and insufficient inventory. 
Finally, the algorithm automatically pushes 
the product promotion adjustment task 
notification to employees via an app.

Intelligent loss identification and 
stocktaking, and efficient inventory 
management: AI image recognition 
identifies and automatically reports damage 
to goods, improving the accuracy of loss 
identification and management efficiency. 
The system monitors and identifies 
products with abnormal turnover rates and 
notifies shop assistants to take inventory, 
enabling the more efficient utilization of 
staff.  

ii.  Reducing fulfillment costs for D2D 

business

Hypermarkets and supermarkets should 
choose the best D2D business fulfillment 
model, which in our experience means 
adopting an integrated store-warehouse 
model. Some regional players can 

19

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaperstrategically establish a ‘dark store’ – a 
community-based transit warehouse that 
fulfills online orders – but it is difficult for 
a standalone warehouse to be profitable. 
Here are the key elements of each model: 

Integrated store-warehouse: This is 
a store-based D2D delivery model that 
can effectively redirect in-store traffic 
online, and unifies online-and-offline 
inventory management to accelerate 
inventory turnover and reduce losses. One 
disadvantage is that regions without an 
offline store footprint are excluded.

A hybrid, integrated store-warehouse and 
dark store model: This holds the advantage 
of covering a wider area, and can expand to 
non-core areas in cities where it is difficult 
to open new stores. The disadvantage lies 
in that single warehouses are not profitable 
below a certain order quantity. Insufficient 
orders are likely to cause losses and 
negatively affect corporate cash flows.

In any case, hypermarkets and 
supermarkets should conduct unified 
inventory management across all channels 
to accelerate inventory turnover and reduce 
inventory costs. Under the integrated store-
warehouse model, there are two inventory 
management methods available:

Fully unified management: Under this 
model, the front shop and back warehouse 
seamlessly fulfill online and offline orders. 
Inventory for each SKU is consistent across 
the online app/applet and store.

Exclusive inventory for online bestsellers: 
SKUs with strong online demand and 
quick turnover can command an exclusive 
area devoted to online delivery in the back 
warehouse.

iii. Reduce in-store labor costs

Reducing labor costs is the key to achieving 
single-store profitability as they constitute 

a high proportion of total expenditures. For 
example, labor accounts for 15 percent-
plus of a traditional supermarket’s total 
costs. Use cases show that traditional 
supermarkets can reduce labor costs by 
around 10 percent through digitalized labor 
management. Two examples are:

Using algorithmic insights to dynamically 
schedule store labor: Some leading 
companies use algorithms to intelligently 
schedule store employees, and bring in 
dynamic labor to reduce costs and improve 
labor efficiency. BetterLife, a grocery chain 
based in Hunan Province, for example, has 
developed a dynamic employment platform, 
including an order-taking system that 
charges by the hour, which connects with 
external personnel recruitment platforms 
to increase stores’ per capita efficiency 
by more than 30 percent. Meanwhile, 
leading new retail companies are adopting 
intelligent shift scheduling models, using 
algorithms to predict peak hours, and 
sending dynamic instructions to store 
employees to direct them to key tasks at 
different times. In this way, the average 
number of employees in the store can be 
reduced by nearly half. 

Using algorithmic insights to increase 
order-picking efficiency: A leading new 
retail enterprise leverages an algorithm to 
recommend the inventory placement of 
each single product SKU (front store or back 
warehouse). At the same time, the algorithm 
automatically assigns picking orders to 
the corresponding employees' personal 
digital assistants (PDAs) based on product 
display locations, order quantities, and labor 
data, helping in-store employees complete 
picking with the highest efficiency.

20

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaperii.   Advanced analytics and supply chain 

automation technology

Leading players automate warehousing 
and production in processing centers 
and fresh food factories. Take Liqun as 
an example: Its warehouse and logistics 
system has been fully automated with a 
robotic palletizer, and automated systems 
for storage and retrieval (ASRS), guided 
vehicles (AGV), and sortation. The fresh 
food factory and central kitchen have also 
introduced automated equipment for data-
based production scheduling. 

iii.  Cross-department decision-making 

mechanisms

As front-end channels and businesses 
diversify and supply chains become 
more complicated, hypermarkets and 
supermarkets are demanding more 
cross-department collaboration. 
Consider establishing a cross-functional 
supply chain operations room and a 
real-time KPI board to ensure efficient 
communication. This should aid timely 
decision making in key areas, including 
managing exceptional and problem cases, 
and supply-demand coordination.

5: Improve supply chain efficiency
Hypermarkets and supermarkets can 
improve the efficiency of their supply chains 
by introducing the following automated and 
digital systems:  

i.   An integrated and differentiated omni-

channel supply chain system

Online and offline integrated 
warehousing and distribution 
significantly lowers costs. In some 
supermarkets, online-to-offline, cross-
channel and cross-model warehousing, 
and logistics systems are siloed. Take a 
supermarket as an example: Its offline 
stores and integrated e-commerce business 
(such as its flagship store on Tmall) use 
two separate warehousing and distribution 
systems, with stores covered by a central/
regional distribution center (CDC/RDC), 
and e-commerce business supported by an 
independent warehouse. The two systems 
are disconnected, and lack a mechanism to 
share and coordinate tasks and inventory. 
If the online and offline logistics systems 
were integrated—if the CDC covered 
demand from the RDC, offline store, and 
e-commerce warehousing via unified omni-
channel management, for example—costs 
could be substantially reduced.

Differentiated supply chain design 
can enhance customer response 
capability. For products that favor quick-
turnover promotions, hypermarkets and 
supermarkets can set up a warehouse near 
the store and set aside stock to frequently 
replenish inventory in small amounts. For 
long-tail products, and in cities and stores 
that are less strategically important, a 
different, lower frequency CDC or supplier 
can save costs and ease pressure on the 
overall stockout rate.

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper3.2 Convenience stores:  
Seizing digital 
opportunities to win 
the next phase

In this section, we address how digitally 
enabled convenience stores2 (CVS) can 
weather oncoming market challenges:

I. Strong overall growth masks an 
increasingly fragmented and lopsided 
market 
Strong consumer demand and policy 
guidance are driving steady growth amid 
huge market potential. Over the past 
five years, the CVS market has registered 
a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of 12 percent, and the sector has scaled 
up steadily (Exhibit 9). While new retail is 
developing rapidly and negatively impacting 
traditional supermarkets, CVS have 
sustained remarkable sales growth through 

inherent their advantages of convenience 
and timeliness.

Meanwhile, lower-tier market expansion 
is occurring rapidly amid extremely 
unbalanced development. CVS 
competitive dynamics, including the rate at 
which some are converting to chain stores, 
is incredibly uneven across Chinese cities 
of different sizes. In tier-one cities, where 
the market grew rapidly and matured early 
on, competition is intense. In contrast, large 
market gaps exist in lower-tier cities 
 (Exhibit 10).

2    CVS are a small grocery format that usually covers less than 400sqm and carry 1,500-2,000 SKUs.

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperA ‘tripartite’ competitive landscape is 
taking shape amid accelerated market 
integration. Unlike Japan, where the top 
three local CVS brands share more than 80 
percent of the market, the Chinese market 
is characterized by multiple players, low 
concentration, and distinct regionalization. 
Typical market players include the following 
three types (excluding forecourt/gas-
station-based CVS): 

i.  Premium CVS, exemplified by Japanese 

stores in tier-one cities: Such stores 
present two major benefits that favor fast 
expansion: one is standardized, high-
quality services; the other is high gross 
profits, driven by differentiated products 
with a high proportion of fresh food and 
high-quality private-brand assortments. 

ii.  Local community grocery stores: Local 
CVS’ penetration and characteristics 
depend on the regional market. They 
exist on a spectrum from tobacco shops 
or mom-and-pop stores, scaling up to 
chain stores, and then those established 
by department stores, supermarkets, and 
other retail enterprises to extend market 
penetration. The latter have local market 
advantages in terms of store layout, 
brand recognition, and supply chain 
fundamentals. Traditional grocery stores 
rely heavily on sales of tobacco, alcohol, 
and beverages, while providing a smaller 
assortment of fresh food and private-
brand products. As a result, they report  
gross profit margins (GPM) of about 25 
percent, lower than the ~35 percent 
GPM of premium CVS. Moreover, their 
operations management systems and 
franchise support mechanisms remain 
immature and in need of standardization.

iii.  New digital-enabled stores rooted in 

technology, algorithms, and efficiency: 
For example,  Bianlifeng, a fast-growing 

CVS chain, is actively developing 
stores that lean heavily on data-driven 
technology and capabilities. The 
company aims for a more standardized, 
automated, and data-driven operation 
along the value chain of traditional CVS, 
including merchandising, logistics, store 
operation, and marketing.

II. Facing the future: 3 major 
challenges loom 
Although the CVS industry boasts 
remarkable growth potential, market players 
are encountering three primary challenges:

i.  Slowing customer traffic growth 

amid a squeeze on daily store sales 
and profitability: Industry leaders are 
rushing to claim market share, especially 
in first-tier cities, increasing store density 
and competition. As fewer locations can 
generate additional customer traffic, new 
stores no longer enjoy traffic dividends. 
Meanwhile, the popularity of instant retail 
and food delivery is also depressing offline 
CVS traffic.

ii.  High reliance on manual labor, 

operations management difficulties, 
and variable single-store daily sales 
and cost controls: CVS’ performance 
is directly related to store managers 
and supervisors’ performance, but it 
takes a long time to train a qualified 
store manager and their churn rate 
is high. This makes it difficult to find 
competent store managers and 
supervisors to drive at-scale expansion. 
The standardization of services, which 
drives overall efficiency, also takes a 
long time to mature. Moreover, at-scale 
expansion of CVS is highly dependent on 
the franchise model. Large CVS brands 
often oversee numerous franchisees 
with vastly different levels of efficiency 

25

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaperand operations management ability. As a 
result, the performance of different stores 
under the same CVS brands can range 
from very profitable to heavily lossmaking. 

iii.  Diverse regional and customer 
characteristics demand refined 
management: Chain CVS operate 
under a single brand but serve customer 
groups in different locations with unique 
consumption and shopping scenario 
demands, and product preferences. A 
single model for thousands of stores 
cannot meet the individual needs of 
local customer groups. Instead, scaled-
up CVS must refine or adapt their 
store formats and management to suit 
particular regions or customer groups. 

III. Digital-enabled CVS reduce costs 
and increase efficiency
Digitalization is assisting leading CVS in 
improving efficiency across site selection, 
operations, merchandising, and the supply 
chain, maximizing consumer conversion 
and ATV. In the following section, we delve 
into four major advantages of the digital 
approach:

i.  Precise site selection ensures ample 

footfall 

     Digital tools and processes can help 
CVS to collect and analyze customer 
traffic data, develop profiles of potential 
consumers, and incorporate location 
features into a model that recommends a 
store site. For example, Meiyijia, a leading 
CVS player with a presence across China, 
analyzes data such as local consumer 
habits, the composition of residents 
and commuters, the characteristics of 
the location itself (such as the presence 
of hospitals, communities, commercial 
centers and other surrounding formats), 
the competitive situation, and the 

proximity of public transport, to calculate a 
score and inform site selection decisions.

ii.  Data-driven merchandising 

management improves store ATV and 
GPM

     Under an extensive merchandising 

management model, stores mainly focus 
on the site and the goods within the store, 
but have a more passive attitude toward 
consumers’ needs and experiences. 
However, the refined management model 
that digital CVS embrace prioritizes 
people, designing and planning stores in a 
customer-centric way. Stores select more 
suitable products, better allocate shelf 
space, and conduct pricing and marketing 
in a more targeted manner, in order to 
increase sales while improving GPM.

     For example, a leading CVS has adopted 
a product selection strategy based on 
store type. When determining what 
products to put on shelves, it first divides 
products into daily necessities, specialty 
categories, and other categories, and then 
groups stores based on the surrounding 
environment, including whether there are 
hospitals, schools, and transportation 
hubs in the area. This helps generate 
accurate consumer profiles and cross-
matching of product and store categories. 
A scorecard for each SKU based on 
historical sales and consumer loyalty 
determines final selection and product 
mix.

iii.  Intelligent demand forecasting and 
automatic inventory replenishment 
reduces wastage and stockouts

     A leading convenience store has 

established a digital demand forecast 
model based on basic store elements, 
weather conditions, cyclical sales 
characteristics, and other factors (such 

26

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaperas holidays), and translated the forecast 
results into SKU purchase guidelines. At 
the same time, a CDC-linked automatic 
replenishment system has cut chain-wide 
inventory days—or the average number of 
days SKUs are warehoused—by 20 days, 
without increasing the stockout rate.

iv.  Digital store management empowers 
staff, supervisors, and operations 
personnel to improve efficiency

     Algorithmic store workloads enable CVS 

managers to optimize labor arrangements 
and task plans, so as to minimize work 
hours without affecting store service 
quality and experience. Even if employees 
encounter unexpected conditions, the 
system can quickly adjust to ensure 
normal store operations. Once staff 
scheduling is confirmed, the system 
automatically issues task orders to 
efficiently guide staff work arrangements.

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper3.3 Shopping malls: 
Embracing breakthrough 
digitalization

Shopping malls come in a variety of sizes 
in China but are united in controlling 
large commercial premises with multiple 
retail tenants. In this section, we suggest 
that while recent market conditions have 
been buoyant, there are several imminent 
challenges that will require shopping malls 
to embrace digital transformation in order to 
achieve sustainable performance:

I. Upbeat growth presents 
opportunities despite the wider foot 
traffic crisis 
Solid growth momentum has created 
a safe harbor for offline retail in this 
segment. In 2021, the market size of 

China’s shopping malls reached RMB 
1.4 trillion after five years of double-digit 
growth (Exhibit 11). Despite e-commerce 
competition and recurring COVID-19 
outbreaks, they evolved and strengthened 
compound advantages of large scale, 
multiple channels, and retail experience. 
Looking ahead, shopping malls should 
continue to expand and capture secondary 
growth opportunities around consumption 
upgrading and improved shopping 
experience.

In an era of plateauing traffic growth and 
heightened focus on managing existing 
customers, challenges and opportunities 
coexist for shopping malls. Although the 
segment as a whole is stable and improving, 
it is facing increasingly serious structural 
problems. The commercial property market 
is entering an era defined by competition for 
an existing customer base characterized by 
excess supply and low quality. 

China’s shopping mall market also shows 
an obvious ‘80-20’ distribution, quality 
operators are scarce, and the long-tail 
is prominent. The profitability of about 
80 percent of projects is lower than the 
average.

Shopping malls face 5 major challenges:

i.  Property developers have slowed their 
expansion as asset-heavy operating 
models have become unsustainable amid 
strained cashflows. Asset securitization 
and light-asset operations have become 
a trend as developers seek to streamline 
their operations.

ii.  The government’s requirements for 

corporate ESG (Environmental, Social 
and Governance) disclosures continue to 
escalate, making green and sustainable 
development imperative.

iii.  Given high homogenization, shopping 
malls face pressure to differentiate 
operations and innovate on content 
marketing.

30

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaperiv.  Merchants’ value proposition is weak. 

Shopping malls need to consider how to 
pivot from passive to active management, 
and implement digital-enabled lean 
operations for merchants.

v.  The regional resurgence of COVID-19 

adds uncertainty to the recovery of offline 
traffic.

In the following section, we summarize three 
core initiatives that should help shopping 
malls accelerate their digital transformation 
and win in the new era of retail competition.

II. Digital initiatives that can drive 
sustainable shopping mall success
The organic traffic dividend in which 
newly built shopping malls attracted 
large customer flows is a thing of the 
past – shopping malls are experiencing 
slowing sales. These enterprises thus need 
to leverage digital to improve operational 
capabilities, raise profitability, and achieve 
sustainable growth. As a first step, shopping 
malls should launch an IT infrastructure 
transformation – connecting the siloed 
and legacy operations systems used in 
the traditional retail industry through 
standard operating procedures and a digital 
management system. 

Subsequently, by introducing advanced 
data analysis and Internet-of-Things (IoT) 
systems, shopping malls can promote 
digital intelligence-based business decision 
making, boost revenue growth, and reduce 
operating costs and energy consumption. 
Two example initiatives include:

Intelligent rental pricing and tenant mix 
management: Leveraging advanced data 
analytics, operators of shopping malls 
can effectively and dynamically predict 
the traffic and sales of different floors 
and locations in the mall, and then adjust 
tenant composition and rental management 
accordingly.

Smart building and green energy 
consumption solutions: In order to meet 
fast-evolving regulatory demands on 
ESG and carbon neutrality, commercial 
property enterprises should review their 
original development model and use 
digital management tools to incorporate 
environmental responsibility into all aspects 
of investment and operations.

A new era in which the market focuses 
on managing existing customers 
has dawned. Shopping malls should 
return to the essence of retail, and 
leverage consumer insights to develop a 
differentiated, customer-centric positioning. 
Constant optimization of products and 
service experience is necessary to carve 
a niche, amid increasingly homogeneous 
competition in top-tier cities, where 
saturation is pinching market share. Below, 
we detail three ways that leading players are 
innovating to reshape content and develop a 
unique positioning: 

i.  Investing in independent, tailored, and 
differentiated business operations: A 
leading shopping center is targeting the 
Shanghai middle class and consumers 
with high disposable income. With this 
customer group in mind, the shopping 
center integrated retail and art in an 
independent installation, offering a 
cultural experience around the theme of 
environmental protection, and sparking a 
trend of similarly differentiated business 
operations in China.

ii.  Developing new consumer businesses: 

SCPG Longbai Capital New Chain 
Business Fund is supporting SCPG 
(Vanke), a leading commercial property 
platform, to invest in data-driven, 
innovative consumer businesses. SCPG 
then integrates the enterprises’ business 
and resources within its ecosystem, 
promoting rapid growth, and ultimately 

31

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaperforming a new and differentiated 
commercial property and consumer 
business ecosystem.

iii.  Exploring multi-channel integration 
that reinvents service experience: 
Hangzhou-based Yintai Retail Group, 
which has a portfolio of department 
stores, shopping malls, and an 
ecommerce business, is developing their 
omni-channel capabilities to improve 
their collection of consumption data 
and explore value-added and after-sale 
services. For example, when consumers 
buy shoes and bags, their system offers 
consumers shoe and bag care, cleaning, 
and after-sales services, which help 
improve the shopping experience and 
enhance consumer stickiness.

Meanwhile, digital intelligence can help 
merchants to operate more efficiently, 
and shopping malls to explore ecological 
value co-creation. Leading shopping malls 
have transformed from being mere lessors 
of space to ‘mentors’, providing merchants 
with diversified solutions and digitally 
empowering them across consumption 
scenarios. Some are now actively probing 
new commercial property innovations, 
such as offline ‘intelligent operations’ 
empowerment platforms, which provide 
merchants with tools such as precision 
marketing and operations diagnostics.

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper3.4 Specialty stores: 
Advancing the value 
chain amid accelerating 
digitalization

Specialty stores specialize in the sale of 
specific types of products – a narrow range 
but long product lines provide consumers 
with richer options. They also often provide 
more comprehensive services, such as 
consulting, delivery, and after-sales services. 
Typical formats include 3C electrical stores, 
pharmacies, cosmetics stores, mother and 
baby stores, glasses stores, and specialty 
food stores. In this section, we suggest that 
specialty stores should focus on leveraging 
digital to improve value chain efficiency and 
customer experience:  

1. Efficiency and user experience drive 
value creation
The rise of specialty stores is a result of 
‘consumption upgrading’, a trend that 
describes how Chinese consumers are 
demanding higher quality goods and services. 
This has led to segmented demand and 
retail specialization. Compared with large, 
integrated retail businesses, specialty stores 

focus on specialty products and exceptional 
service to shape the value chain, providing 
higher-quality and more distinctive products 
as well as broader and better services. 

Building a competitive edge in this segment 
means refining operations along each 
specific link in the value chain, while 
adopting a dual focus on front-end and 
back-end operations. The emphasis 
at the front-end should be providing 
a rich consumer experience across all 
touchpoints. At the back-end, elevating 
operational efficiency, especially supply 
chain management, is key. Enterprises 
should also concentrate on improving 
customer lifetime value (CLV). A value 
chain coordination matrix, with efficiency 
and the user as the two axes, can help 
companies define their position in relation to 
competitive factors in their vertical  
(Exhibit 12).

User experience first

Below, we flesh out scenarios under which 
various specialty store types can focus 
on different aspects of the value matrix to 
improve performance: 

3C electronics stores should prioritize 
efficiency to gain competitive advantage: 
3C electronics products are relatively 
high value, so it is crucial to have efficient 
circulation and cost control at the middle 
and back end of the supply chain. Moreover, 
as typical 3C electronics retailers operate 
a large and complicated distribution 
system, channel inventory turnover and 
management transparency are often 
bottlenecks. Therefore, retailers should 
focus on lean franchise management, for 
example reducing the number of distributors 
and streamlining their networks, if they want 
to establish a competitive advantage and 
expand business scale.

For beauty and mother and baby stores, 
increasing CLV drives breakthroughs. 
Specialty stores sell goods with a shorter 

lifecycle and a more direct purchase-
decision chain. Impulse buying is more 
common, so it is necessary to develop 
comprehensive user operations based on 
consumer insights to elevate customer 
experience. Delivering exceptional targeted 
content marketing and service experience 
can drive customer loyalty and thus raise 
CLV. 

Footwear and apparel stores, and retail 
pharmacies, can focus on both value 
chains and users to drive operational 
efficiency. For example, retail pharmacies 
are competing intensely for existing 
customers, so lean franchise management 
plus an efficient product supply system 
will play an important role in accelerating 
at-scale integration. Consumers’ health 
awareness is also increasing, driving higher 
requirements among pharmaceutical 
care providers. At the same time, product 
categories sold at pharmacies are expected 
to become more consumption-oriented, 

36

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper 
ensuring consumer insights and operations 
will be critical to differentiating from the 
competition. Accordingly, retail pharmacies 
need to broaden their imagination when it 
comes to launching value-added services, 
and deciding product assortment.

Four digital enablers 
that are key to digital 
transformation

38

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper4.1 The middle office: 
Improving operational 
efficiency to enable 
diversified expansion

CXOs now view middle-office (middle 
platform) capacity building as key to 
increasing the operational efficiency 
of chain retail while supporting multi-
channel business development. Alibaba 
pioneered the “middle office” concept in 
2015, spurring other Internet enterprises 
to follow suit and construct their own 
middle-office architecture. According to 
our research, about two-thirds of retail 
enterprises have announced their intention 
to build a middle office, while the remainder 
are factoring this into their near-term 
planning.

For retail enterprises, there are three 
primary reasons to build a middle office: 

i. 

 To develop common, reusable business 
capabilities and avoid creating 
information silos across business units, 
systems, and data platforms, so as to 
reduce costs and improve efficiency;

ii.   To help expand new channels, regions, 
and customer sources, and incubate 
new and fast-growing businesses by 
providing consistent and shareable 
front-office capabilities;

iii.   To reduce labor costs, standardize 

operations, and improve efficiency– 
middle offices reduce reliance on senior 
store managers for rapid store expansion 
by divesting the responsibility for sharing 
knowledge and experience from stores 
while unifying operational decision 
making.

Explainer: Digital middle offices in 
the retail industry
A complete middle office architecture 
is usually composed of the business 
middle office, data middle office, and 
technology middle office, and requires 
multi-dimensional support across business 
units and the wider organizational structure, 
underpinned by technology and data.

39

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperIn the retail industry, the front office usually 
refers to channel touchpoints, such as 
stores, apps, and applets that interface 
directly with consumers. The middle office 
serves as the operations center, providing 
replicable, plug-and-play business 
operations support or technical solutions 
for front offices, such as those for supply 
chain and product management. The back 
office is a company’s long-term stable 
infrastructure and shared services platform, 
with finance and human resources serving 
as two primary examples.

For retail enterprises, the business middle 
office is the main bearer of enterprise-
level reusable capabilities. The data middle 
office serves the data needs of the business 
middle office and front office through 
the collection, storage, processing, and 
product-oriented use of large-scale data. 
The technology middle office facilitates the 
rapid build out of the business middle office 
and data middle office through a unified 
and convenient infrastructure and interface 
(Exhibit 13).

Merchandising middle office: These 
focus on improving product gross profit and 
single-store sales, while reducing product 
operating costs. Regular modules covered 
comprise category planning, assortment, 
product life cycle management (from 
introduction to removal), pricing and price 
management, promotion management, and 
other functions.

Supply chain middle office: Such offices 
centralize procurement to reduce costs, 
and leverage large scale to establish stable 
cooperative relationships with upstream 
suppliers, and secure supply advantages 
across differentiated and novel products. 
Meanwhile, intensive and intelligent 
warehouse management reduces supply 
chain costs while optimizing inventory to 
reduce capital occupation and inventory 
depletion. Regular modules covered 
include procurement sourcing, purchase 
orders, inventory management, warehouse 
management, logistics management, 
supplier management, and other functions. 

The business middle office: The 
linchpin of digital enterprises’ 
operational efficiency
The business middle office is crucial to 
improving operational efficiency and 
carries the core competencies of the 
retail value chain. A thorough middle 
office strategy requires retailers to shift 
away from an operating model in which 
front offices shoulder a heavy operational 
burden, instead centralizing some front-
end operations capabilities in the business 
middle office, thereby creating a lighter 
operating model that makes regions and 
stores more agile.

Notably, there is no prevailing definition of 
middle office functions, and their scope may 
vary across different types of businesses, 
and even across different enterprises in 
the same industry. Taking hypermarkets, 
supermarkets, CVS, and other grocery 
retailers as examples, the business middle 
office can be broadly divided into the 
following types:

User operations middle office: These aim 
to increase the number of users, ARPU, 
and CLV, as well as customer retention 
and satisfaction rates. Regular modules 
incorporated include loyalty program and 
membership benefits, consumer insights 
and segmentation, customer life cycle 
management, customer service and 
after-sales management, user experience 
monitoring and index design, and omni-
channel marketing management.

Store operations middle office: These 
improve single-store sales and inventory 
turnover, and reduce store labor and 
product shrinkage. Regular modules 
covered include store location and network 
planning, store preparation and design, 
staff empowerment and training, order 
replenishment, display management, 

41

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperKey considerations for retailers when 
building a business middle office  
The business middle office is not a 
shared service center, but is jointly 
responsible for business metrics with 
front offices. Compared with a traditional 
shared service center, the middle office is 
defined by business needs and changes 
with the evolution of the business. Unlike 
the shared service center as a cost center, 
which often only assesses “business 
response/satisfaction” KPIs, the middle 
office undertakes KPI objectives in 
tandem with supported front offices. For 
example, the user operations center should 
be responsible for the number of active 
members of a retailer’s CRM, as well as 
ARPU, while the store operations center 
should be responsible for stores’ gross 
profit and sales.

The middle office not only supports 
front offices but also plays a supervisory 
and coaching role. For example, the 
user operations middle office is geared to 
develop enterprise-level user experience-
related indicators, monitor and review 
the user experience KPIs of different 
front-office business departments and 
channels/stores, and make suggestions for 
improvement.

Clarifying responsibilities and areas 
for collaboration between the business 
middle office and front office is key. The 
division of responsibilities between front 
and middle offices should be determined 
on a case-by-case basis according to 

functions such as procurement, pricing, and 
promotion, and in line with the individual 
business. The extent to which the middle 
office is given the power to coordinate, or 
whether the front office is given decision-
making flexibility, should be considered 
from three main aspects:

i. 

 The degree to which the business 
scenario is close to the consumer, where 
a quick response to market changes is 
required;

ii.   Whether the business scenario or 

product attributes are highly regional/
localized and less standardized;

iii.   Scenario complexity: For example, in 

terms of product selection and portfolio, 
the middle office of supermarkets and 
hypermarkets can employ weak control 
to grant certain decision-making power 
to stores; whereas CVS can conduct 
strong control after the data foundation 
is mature and the selection model is 
tested and iterated, with the middle 
office making unified, pan-franchise 
decisions on product selection.

Building the middle office is a long-term, 
complex and modular project that cannot 
be accomplished in one move. There is 
no standard solution for a business middle 
office and each should be built in phases 
that align with the individual business, 
taking the maturity of its capabilities into 
consideration during each phase.

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper4.2  Organizational 
transformation: 
Embracing agile and 
reshaping culture

To make the most of digitalization, 
retail enterprises need a compatible 
organizational structure. Internal hurdles 
must be removed to unleash the full value 
of business innovation and transformation 
when reinventing business models and 
value chains. Organizational structure 
thus needs to evolve in step with the major 
stages of retail digitalization (Exhibit 14).

When retail enterprises proceed towards 
a later stage of Digitalization 3.0, digital 
intelligence capabilities should be deeply 
integrated with operations and product 
teams, creating a versatile middle 
office while promoting omni-channel 
transformation and upgrades across the 
value chain.

Embracing agile work
As retailers accelerate digital 
transformation, adopting agile ways of 
working is essential. Organizations in the 
digital era should be ‘hard and soft’ – a 
hard organizational structure provides the 
frame for a ‘soft’ and agile working culture 
– in order to adapt to a fast-changing 

retail environment and increasingly blurred 
business boundaries. For traditional retail 
enterprises, agile transformation cannot 
be achieved overnight, but requires 
differentiated working methods tailored 
to different business scenarios and 
organizational structures (Exhibit 15).

regenerate growth momentum. Below we 
list three key changes that are important for 
organizations to implement so that working 
culture moves in step with organizational 
change: 

i. 

 Embracing a management mindset 
shift from top-down leadership 
towards an inclusive model: 

While industry changes may bring 
unpredictable challenges, reshaping and 
enhancing management team leadership 
provides a backstop or failsafe for 
retailers during digital transformation. 
The adjustment helps leaders effectively 
balance active and passive roles, so 
that they can lead by example while 
delegating powers to employees, and 
ensuring that the latter feel comfortable 
communicating problems and 
suggesting solutions along the way.

ii.   Empowering employees: Leaders are 
a catalyst for action. They should guide 
the team to figure out the value, content, 
and business impact of their actions 
rather than excessively interfering in the 
working process. A servant-leadership 
model fully empowers employees to take 
responsibility for their work and career 
development, helping the business 
optimally deploy staffing resources. 

iii.  Adopting a hands-on approach and 
a ‘can do’ attitude: Leaders also need 
to deeply understand the business 
frontline, keep an open mind, and learn 
and experiment with employees. They 
are expected to encourage an open and 
transparent working environment by 
taking the initiative to share experiences 
and express their thoughts, before 
inviting others to do the same. 

Managing organizational change 
Achieving digital organizational change 
for retail enterprises is a long and arduous 
journey. Apart from a clear vision, retailers 
also have to clarify the path of change 
and align related businesses so they 
progress as one. It usually takes 18-24 
months to truly internalize organizational 
change and achieve comprehensive digital 
transformation.

Finally, digital organizational change is 
intimately linked to talent and capability 
development. To build a digital talent team, 
improving the recruitment process for key 
roles in digital transformation, particularly 
for the director of the digital innovation 
center and the chief procurement officer, 
is a priority. A talent-to-value approach 
can effectively guide retailers to accurately 
identify and match digitalization talent. 
Our research suggests 2 percent of staff 
positions can contribute 80 percent of value 
creation for future digital transformation 
initiatives.

Making rapid impact 
across business domains

Deploying AI at scale is a key enabler of 
the benefits of digital transformation, and 
a core element of the various initiatives 
and business scenarios discussed in 
the previous sections. However, in our 
experience, many companies have not yet 
figured out how to fully capture the promise 
of AI, and struggle with implementing the 
technology in a manner that generates 
immediate and significant impact. In the 
following section, we suggest several 
steps that retailers can take to scale AI 
successfully.3

1. Set the strategy first 
It is important to start with a plan, including 
deciding which business domain to start 
with, selecting the right people to drive 
things forward, and choosing the data and 
technology that will underpin success. 
Different domains along the value chain 
can improve either the company’s bottom 
line or customer or employee experiences. 

Start with the domain that has the biggest 
potential impact. One retailer determined 
that it had nine main business domains that 
could benefit from digitalization: revenue 
management, e-commerce, customer 
experience, store format, store footprint, 
sales force, operations, logistics, and talent. 

There are two main criteria for picking 
the best domain to begin with from this 
comprehensive list – the quality and 
composition of the team and the reusability 
of data and technology. In the first case, it 
is important to have an internal business 
champion responsible for the entire value 
chain. Senior business executives can then 
act as ‘product owners’ (people responsible 
for solution delivery), translators (who 
bridge the analytics and business realms), 
and ‘change leads’ (responsible for change 
management efforts). In addition, a team of 
AI practitioners, such as data science and 
engineering experts, designers, business 
analysts, and a scrum master (all of whom 

3    See “Getting AI to Scale”; Fountaine, McCarthy, and Saleh; Harvard Business Review (May-June 2021)

51

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepapermay also be drawn from a central team 
in the organization) is required. From an 
implementation point of view, a cross-
functional team with representation from 
the sales force, marketing, and category 
managers should be responsible for day-to-
day activities. 

For the data and technology aspect, 
companies usually have components in 
place that can be used by different domains. 
Mapping the data and technology and 
planning on how to reuse aspects where 
they overlap can dramatically reduce 
development time and cost; data and 
technology act as enablers, not obstacles, 
of progress. It is unnecessary to have the 
perfect data and technical backbone in 
place before testing and implementing use 
cases. On the contrary, starting with the 
business use case – or the problem you 
want to solve or improvement you want to 
make – and working backwards will hone 
understanding of the data and digital tools 
that are required, and avoid costly and time-
consuming mistakes. 

2. Reimagine business as usual
Getting the most from AI requires 
reinventing business models, roles and 
responsibilities, and operational processes, 
and using new ways of thinking and working. 
The ultimate goal is to make AI part of 
business as usual. It is not enough to just to 
try an enhance an existing process using 
AI. Companies need to rethink the entire 
process itself to maximize the benefit of 
new analytical techniques. 

A good example is how retailers allow their 
store managers to manage assortment 
dynamically. Today, retailers operate 
national and international chains with 
customers who are demographically 
diverse, and constantly changing their 

channel affinities. This means it is important 
to know what customers want, what kind 
of products to put in the store, and how to 
allocate shelf space across massive-scale 
SKUs.  

The legacy approach was plagued by 
store manager guesswork as they tried 
to estimate customer preferences, with 
inaccurate forecasting leading to stockouts 
of popular products and requiring the 
use of open-to-buy (OTB) dollars to 
replenish stock. Over-ordering was also 
commonplace, increasing waste. At the 
same time, they also struggled to test new 
products as there was no space on the 
shelves, or they could not predict customer 
preferences.    

In one company, store managers identified 
and understood the issues with the existing 
processes before mapping out what an ideal 
alternative might look like. They identified 
problems to solve and improvements they 
wanted to see. The company then built an 
AI prototype dashboard by compiling data 
from point-of-sale (POS) systems, loyalty 
programs, and syndicated data sources 
to indicate which SKUs were driving 
each category. Managers were given the 
opportunity and power to rapidly choose 
assortments that more precisely aligned 
with customer needs, as well as access to 
intuitive dashboards that visualize how many 
and which products should be offered in 
each category. They can view information 
showing how adding or removing an SKU 
would change category sales. Integrated 
feedback loops enable the AI systems 
to refine, update, and make product 
recommendations based on what works, 
rather than relying on intuition or personal 
experience. 

52

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper3. Adapt to an agile way of working 
In most cases, significant organizational 
change is needed to adapt to the 
interdisciplinary collaboration and the 
agile working methods required to scale 
AI successfully. Leaders like the CEO 
and domain managers need to act as role 
models, reaching across organizational 
boundaries to make the new behavior 
sustainable. Moving to a sound agile 
operating model requires leadership to 
transform from ‘masterminds’ who delegate 
tasks and instructions in a top-down 
manner, to ‘catalysts and collaborators’ 
who meet with the team on a daily basis and 
ensure the delivery of impact. 

The traditional technology/IT delivery 
model, with heavy upfront planning and little 
flexibility, should install agile feedback loops 
that enable a test-and-learn approach, 
with constant reiterations refining output. 
Organizations can then transition from a 
focus on scheduling and protocols to one 
that concentrates on producing better 
products and business models. As a result, 
businesses need interdisciplinary teams 
that own a specific product or customer 
journey, and take full responsibility for 
building the right pathways.4

4.  Leverage Machine Learning 

Operations to industrialize AI 
capabilities

Once we have the AI prototype and process 
in place and pilots have proven impact, the 
next important step is to industrialize the 
AI capability. To build, deploy, and manage 
analytics/AI applications with speed and 
efficiency at scale, a rapidly expanding 
stack of technologies and services is 
required. This enables teams to move from a 
manual and development-focused approach 
to one that’s more automated, modular, 
and fit to address the entire AI lifecycle. 

This best-in-class working framework, 
often called MLOps (Machine Learning 
Operations), enables organizations to take 
advantage of these advances and create 
a standard, company-wide AI ‘factory’ 
capable of achieving scale. It ensures your 
AI modeling and implementation withstands 
the test of time, and that the performance 
of your AI solutions does not degrade to the 
point of inutility. MLOps is relatively new and 
still evolving, and encompasses the entire 
AI lifecycle – data management, model 
development, and deployment, and live 
model operations. 

Building an MLOps capability will materially 
shift how data scientists, engineers, and 
technologists work as they move from 
bespoke builds to a more industrialized 
production approach. The business impact 
of MLOps is not just about productivity 
and speed, but also improving reliability 
and reducing risk while refining talent 
acquisition and retention. 

5. Scale to other business domains
Once the business sees proof of impact and 
the organization becomes familiar with the 
new agile way of working, the company is 
ready to scale AI to other domains. Ideally, 
these are domains in which either data or 
assets can be reused, such as expanding a 
supply chain across multiple business units, 
or else where similar customer journey 
mapping can be applied to another area of 
the business. A good example of the latter 
are typical customer value management 
levers like next-product-to-buy or churn 
forecasting. 

Successful implementation typically also 
means fostering a team of ‘advanced 
analytics’ practitioners, which comes with 
its own potential pitfalls. Depending on the 
starting point, it can be hard to hire and

internally. We suggest that analytics 
translators, or the people who determine 
corporate problems that can be solved 
through analytics solutions and work to 
implement them, be hired or fostered 
internally. Analytical modeling for initial use 
cases can be outsourced to specialized 
vendors, to speed up delivery and impact. 
In parallel, companies can hire their own 
analytics talent and build an internal team 
in tandem with implementing more use 
cases, gradually scaling existing models 
and developing new AI applications. This 
tends to work better than a “big bang” 
approach of acquiring a boutique AI firm, 
where valuations tend to be outsized and 
integration issues are myriad.

2022 China Retail Digitalization Whitepaper4.4 In-store technology: 
Reimagining future stores 

Labor costs and labor shortages are a top 
concern for CVS, especially in tier-one 
Chinese cities. The average monthly salary 
in Shanghai rose to over 11,000 RMB in 
2021, up ~10 percent compared with the 
previous year. Such labor cost pressure is 
likely to only further intensify as competition 
ripples out to lower tier cities, too. 

according to McKinsey research. In the 
store of the future, non-value-added work 
will be rapidly digitalized and automated, 
including cashiering, replacing shelf labels, 
labor scheduling, and ordering, among other 
functions. Automation of in-store operations 
also enables stores to extend their opening 
hours to 24/7 without additional labor costs.

Adopting digital and automation solutions 
can alleviate this pressure by improving 
operational efficiency while elevating 
shopping experience. Over the past year, 
we have been working with retail partners 
to explore future-store possibilities, and 
have identified several key areas where 
automation and analytics technology can 
bring value to retailers:

i. 

 Improving efficiency and precision 
in-store operations

Automated store operations and 
extended opening hours: About half of 
the activities in retail can be automated, 

Standardized store operations and 
precision store management: Store 
operations activities that cannot be 
automated will be standardized in the 
form of tasks with defined procedures and 
protocols. IoT equipment (including cameras 
and sensors) facilitate the automatic 
generation and assignment of tasks to staff 
using real-time in-store data (for example, 
on-shelf product availability, cleanliness 
issues, products close to expiration date). 
At the same time, store and field managers 
will be equipped with remote-management 
tools to track performance in a more 
convenient and accurate manner.

57

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperDigitalized store operations and impact 
quantification: Retailers can use each 
store’s unique data to create a ‘digital twin’ 
store to digitalize its operations and quantify 
their impact. For example, advanced 3D 
depth-sensing cameras camera with 
hand tracking and gesture recognition 
technologies can track detailed customer 
shopping behaviors (such as browsing, 
or pick-up and return), enabling online 
conversion funnel analysis in offline stores. 
The conversion rate at each stage of the 
customer journey can be calculated, from 
walk-in, to stop-by, to pick-up, and final 
purchase. Moreover, operations impact can 
be measured, for example, how many more 
customers are attracted by new on-shelf 
signage.

ii.   Providing a seamless and personalized 

customer shopping experience

Seamless checkout: About 37 percent 
of shoppers find waiting in lines to be their 
top frustration when shopping offline, our 
research suggests. In future, friction across 
key customer journeys will be reduced. 
Consumers empowered by “grab-and-go” 
technology will no longer have to wait in line, 
and can instead complete a purchase in less 
than a minute. 

Personalized assortment and 
promotions: Data collected by IoT devices 
in store allows retailers to better understand 
consumer preferences based on their 
shopping behaviors. The application of 
AI will help retailers tailor assortments 
to consumer needs and personalize 
recommendations for future purchases. 
With better demand forecasting, stockouts 
will also be reduced. 

Consumer-centric store layout: Retailers 
can derive insights from customer traffic 
flows and visit duration to optimize store 
layout design. Consumers should be able to 

find what they are looking for more easily, 
and at the same time will be more likely 
to spend extra time and money on other 
products.

The economic argument for 
automated stores 
Automated stores can improve economic 
performance, providing an uplift of the 
store operating margin by 3-5 percent. 
Value is predominantly derived from labor 
cost reductions as well as operational 
improvements, such as: 

Using autonomous checkout technology: 
About 25 percent of store staff work can 
be released and reallocated (typically ~5 
percent cost reduction on a CVS’ profit and 
loss). Additionally, store operations can be 
expanded to 24/7 without elevating labor 
costs.

Operational improvements driven by 
data and analytics: High-impact use 
cases include membership and loyalty 
programs, personalized promotions, 
pricing optimization, assortment and 
merchandising, planogram optimization, 
stockout replenishment, and precision store 
management. 

As technologies mature, the store of the 
future has become more affordable. Over 
the past five years, the cost of in-store 
technology solutions has fallen rapidly – to 
just a few hundred thousand RMB for a 
100m2 CVS (compared with over $1 million 
for an Amazon Go store in the United 
States). 

With reduced investment costs driving 
improved returns, a typical new store 
is expected to recoup the incremental 
investment within 2-3 years (on par with 
the average 2-3-year breakeven time for 
opening a traditional CVS store).

58

2022 China Retail Digitalization WhitepaperAutomating offline stores: 4 factors 
essential for success 
To implement next-generation in-store 
technology smoothly and at-scale, 
retailers should take into consideration the 
following elements: CEO-backed change 
management, customer-centricity, the 
necessary level of supporting investment, 
and pragmatic implementation:

CEO/CDO backing: The CEO/CDO needs 
to drive change management across the 
entire organization. Implementing new 
technology is not simply a matter of ‘plug-
and-play’, but requires tailored operational 
change, and adaptation to new operating 
models across different functions, 
demanding buy-in from store associates 
and supervisors, as well as regional 
managers.  

Customer-centricity: Customer-facing 
use cases should guide the technological 
foundation in the knowledge that there is no 
single formula for success. Companies can 
prioritize two or three high-value use cases 
that are tailored to customers’ needs, easy 
to implement, and able to carve out strong 
near-term differentiation.

Sufficient investment: Despite the 
advantages technology can bring, retailers 
are still heavily underinvesting in IT and 
digital. Traditional CVS retailers typically 
spend 0.2-0.6 percent of their revenues 
on IT, compared with 5 percent in business 

and professional services, and 7 percent 
in banking, according to McKinsey 
research. Substantially more investment is 
required to succeed and deliver a complete 
transformation.

Pragmatic implementation: Developing 
the store of the future requires a pragmatic 
process of piloting and continuous iteration. 
It is common to start with a small pilot with 
a cross-functional agile team, and establish 
a dynamic loop that allows for feedback 
and improvements. Successful models are 
then scaled up in batches and rolled out 
gradually.

Conclusion
Clearly, the aforementioned digital enablers 
of a middle office, at-scale AI, digital 
organization, and in-store technology, 
are all essential elements of a successful 
digital transformation. They are also closely 
intertwined. For example, AI-enabled 
in-store technology is redundant if a retailer 
lacks the organizational structure and 
middle office capabilities to make the most 
out of the insights IoT devices can derive. 
Retailers and stores of the future should 
seek to deploy the enablers in synchronized 
fashion to drive optimum performance and 
address the multifarious challenges present 
in China’s retail market.
