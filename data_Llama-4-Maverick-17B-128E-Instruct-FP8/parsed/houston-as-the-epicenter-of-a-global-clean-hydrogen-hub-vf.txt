Preface

This report is the result of work by the 
Houston Energy Transition Initiative’s 
(HETI) Hydrogen Working Group, a 
collaboration organized by the Greater 
Houston Partnership (GHP) and the 
Center for Houston’s Future (CHF) to 
develop a shared vision for how the 
Houston region and the state of Texas 
can lead the energy transition. 

HETI seeks to leverage Houston’s 
energy leadership to accelerate global 
solutions for a low-carbon future. 
HETI’s objective is to create a vision 
and a blueprint for growing the region’s 
economy, exporting low-carbon 
products and expertise, equitably 
creating new jobs, and helping  
Houston achieve the goals of its 
Climate Action Plan.

The report examines one aspect of that 
goal: the viability of a Houston-led clean 
hydrogen regional hub and describes 
what the state could achieve in terms 
of scale, cost, and diversity of projects 
over time. 

The Department of Energy (DOE) 
defines a regional clean hydrogen 
hub as “a network of clean hydrogen 
producers, potential clean hydrogen 
consumers, and connective 
infrastructure located in close 
proximity.”1  In addition, in the recently 
passed Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act, Congress defined “clean 
hydrogen” as hydrogen production that 

meets specific CO2 emissions targets.2 
Consistent with these definitions, 
this report focuses on building a view 
of the physical clean hydrogen value 
chain in Texas, including competitive 
advantages and unlocks required to 
drive the creation of the hub. More 
specifically, the report discusses the 
supply of and the demand for clean 
hydrogen in Texas and offers a vision 
and a roadmap for how a hydrogen 
ecosystem  led by Houston could 
develop. 

This report presents a baseline view of 
clean hydrogen in Texas, reflecting a 
shared understanding of the potential 
among several players across the value 
chain. This view has been iteratively co-
developed and incorporates inputs 
from members of the Hydrogen 
Working Group.

The report demonstrates how Houston 
can become a true hydrogen economy, 
which will require markets, infrastructure, 
pricing, carbon trading, and risk 
management. Such an ecosystem will be 
transformative by enabling participants 
across different value chain segments to 
drive innovation.

In addition, the report examines 
four cross-cutting enablers: policy,3 
infrastructure, innovation, and talent. 
The report concludes with a synthesis 
of this effort and highlights areas to 
explore further in subsequent work. 
Finally, the appendix provides additional 
details on the assumptions, tools, and 
references used in this analysis. 

The report attempts to clearly 
delineate inclusions and exclusions 
for these estimates where relevant. 
Therefore, any attempt to compare 
estimates in this report with other 
published data on clean hydrogen 
production costs, for example, 
must take the specific context and 
assumptions into account.

While this report primarily focuses 
on achieving the emissions and cost 
targets required to develop a clean 
hydrogen hub, more work is required 
to ensure that the benefits of a clean 
hydrogen hub flow to all communities. 
Achieving outcomes that support 
environmental justice, create good 
jobs, and incentivize U.S-based 
manufacturing are all core to the vision 
of a successful clean hydrogen hub in 
Texas. While much of this work is still 
in development, the report references 
many evolving efforts to build the 
hydrogen economy, including several 
key environmental justice, workforce, 
and other initiatives  that will be integral 
to the clean hydrogen vision and 
roadmap.4 

The intended audience for the report 
includes members of the business 
community, non-profits, academic 
institutions, policymakers, and 
other organizations with an interest 
in Houston’s future clean hydrogen 
economy. The report is organized 
for both linear flow and modularity: 
Readers can choose to focus on a 
specific chapter without having to 
reference earlier chapters. 

The report discusses statistics, 
forecasts, and other figures obtained 
from publicly available sources, 
companies in the hydrogen working 
group at the Center for Houston’s 
Future, and interviews with subject 
matter experts. Estimated costs of 
hydrogen production, storage, and 
transport are context specific and 
reflect a particular set of conditions. The 
analysis is cost-based and excludes profit 
margin; 2020 was used as a starting point 
because this year represents the most 
complete and accurate data available at 
the time of writing.

3  While this report addresses policy and focuses on the economics of hydrogen demand and 
production, it does not take an advocacy stance. This is an area where additional work is 
warranted, and there are several efforts currently underway.

4  For example, the City of Houston has launched Complete Communities and Resilient Houston to 

support equity initiatives in under-resourced communities.

summary1

Around the globe, governments 
are recognizing the importance of 
clean hydrogen in building an energy 
system to reach net-zero carbon 
emissions. As of October 2021, 17 
governments had published hydrogen 
strategies and more than 20 were in 
the process of developing strategies.1  
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
has declared clean hydrogen crucial to 
achieving President Biden’s goals of a 
100% clean electrical grid by 2035 and 
net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.2

The current economics of clean 
hydrogen production and distribution 
do not currently support large-scale 
adoption by customers to replace 
lower-cost, higher-carbon-intensity 
alternatives. Regional hydrogen hubs 
have the potential to accelerate the 
scaling of hydrogen through concerted 
development of demand, supply, and 
infrastructure. But policy interventions 
will be required to drive down costs 
and incentivize the adoption of clean 
hydrogen. 

A Houston-led clean hydrogen 
hub could have sizeable and lasting 
impact on the region. Based on the 
estimated potential, the economic, 
environmental, and social benefits 
in 2050 could be substantial, 
fundamentally shaping the long-term 
vision of the hydrogen hub.  
This vision rests on an assessment 

of the clean hydrogen value chain, 
including both supply and demand, and 
sample projects. Realizing the vision 
will require implementing a core set 
of enablers. Key findings across these 
topics are summarized below: 

Supply 
y Many factors give Texas significant 

advantages on the cost and 
capacity of hydrogen production 
such as abundant renewable power 
generation and low-cost natural 
gas, existing hydrogen production 
capacity, favorable geological 
formations for storing hydrogen and 

CO2, and local demand drivers, as well 
as top-caliber academic research and 
industry-led innovation.

 ‒ Texas already benefits from 

access to renewables and natural 
gas, with Texas producing more 
wind-powered generation and 
natural gas than any other state.3

 ‒ Clean hydrogen production costs 

in Texas could improve from 
2022 to 2050, with electrolysis-
based hydrogen cost decreases 
attributable primarily to lower 
renewable costs and electrolyzer 
system capital expenditures

(capex), and natural-gas-based 
hydrogen cost decreases 
attributable to system efficiency 
gains and capex reductions.

 ‒ The estimated cost of producing 

natural-gas-based hydrogen with 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
in 2030 could meet the DOE’s 
goal of $1/kg of clean hydrogen; 
however, electrolysis-based 
hydrogen is unlikely to achieve 
this target without government 
interventions in the form of 
research and development funding 
or direct incentives for hydrogen 
production and supporting 
technologies, such as renewables 
and CCS.

y Texas has natural advantages in 

developing cost-effective hydrogen
transport and storage, given its 
extensive oil and gas and hydrogen 
pipelines, experience in hydrogen 
storage, salt caverns, and developed 
port infrastructure.

y The Gulf Coast is positioned to 

be the center of a clean hydrogen 
U.S. export hub, given its ability to 
potentially compete with likely major 
exporters (e.g., Australia, Chile, and 
Saudi Arabia) on the delivered cost 
of hydrogen by leveraging its cost 
advantages and significant port 
infrastructure. Several strategic 
considerations (e.g., security, 
reliability, and capacity) also provide 
advantages. 

Demand
y While global clean hydrogen demand
is limited today, it is expected to 
grow 6-8% each year on average 
between 2030-50. Hydrogen is 
expected to play a critical role in 
decarbonizing sectors such as 

industry, mobility, and power – 
potentially addressing 660 million 
tons (MT) of worldwide demand by 
2050, according to the Hydrogen 
Council.4

y Demand for clean hydrogen in 

Texas could reach 21 MT by 2050 
– compared to current demand of 
3.6 MT for conventionally produced 
hydrogen. The expected demand 
in 2050 comprises 11 MT for local 
demand and a surplus of 10 MT for 
export.

 ‒ Export of hydrogen and hydrogen-
based fuels is the largest driver of 
the increase, contributing ~10 MT 
of hydrogen demand.

 ‒ Industrial applications are the 
second largest driver, with 
feedstock and heating in sectors 
such as refining, petrochemicals, 
ammonia, iron and steel, and 
cement accounting for ~6 MT of 
hydrogen demand.

 ‒ Mobility is the third largest driver 
with ground transportation (trucks, 
light commercial vehicles, and 
buses) accounting for ~2.3 MT of 
hydrogen demand and marine and 
aviation accounting for ~1.5 MT of 
hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuel 
demand.

 ‒ Utility power generation is the 

fourth largest driver with energy 
storage and local grid natural gas 
blending accounting for ~1.6 MT of 
hydrogen demand. 

Vision and strategic roadmap
y The proposed 2050 vision could have 
massive impact on climate, jobs, and 
the economy, including an estimated 
220 MT of global CO2 abatement,
$100 billion in economic value, and 
the creation of 180,000 jobs.

y With the right supportive policy 

frameworks, Texas with Houston at 
its core could become the global 
leader in clean hydrogen production, 
application, development, and 
exports; the resulting thriving 
hydrogen community could push 
innovation and develop the necessary 
talent to conceive and deliver 
hydrogen projects.

y Realizing the 2050 vision requires a 

multiphase roadmap. Phase 1 
(2022-25) should jumpstart a vibrant 
ecosystem while advocating for 
regulatory and policy incentives. Phase 
2 (2025-30) should decarbonize 
existing applications while exploring 
new ones. In Phase 3 (2030-35), the 
hub should seek to achieve the target 
of $1/kg of clean hydrogen while 
further scaling local demand and 
export in Phase 4 (2035-50).

y Texas could substantially improve 
social and environmental conditions 
for all communities, especially by 
focusing on environmental justice 
(EJ) for disadvantaged communities 
affected by industrial pollution. This is 
an opportunity to better serve those 
residents who might be 
disproportionately impacted by poor 
air quality and other environmental 
factors. 

Sample projects 
y As the clean hydrogen ecosystem 
develops, a variety of projects 
addressing supply, demand, and 
infrastructure might spread across 
the state, concentrated in areas 
around Greater Houston, Corpus 
Christi and South Texas, Dallas and 
the Texas Triangle, Beaumont and 
East Texas, and West Texas.
y The hub structure would enable

an integrated ecosystem, which 
balances supply, demand, and 
infrastructure needs. Achieving 
an end-to-end balance would 
require an orchestrated approach 
by participants across the clean 
hydrogen value chain. 

Cross-cutting enablers
y Government commitments, 

direct incentives, and regulatory 
frameworks are the major policy 
instruments for decreasing cost 
and increasing demand. In addition 
to federal policies, Texas should 
implement state-level policies to 
accelerate progress toward realizing 
the 2050 vision. This report provides 
an initial view on policy topics.  More 
work is needed to flesh out the 
appropriate options.

y Scaling hydrogen will require 

developing infrastructure, including
hydrogen transport and storage, 
fueling stations, CO2 transport 
and storage, water purification 
and transportation, electricity 
transmission, port infrastructure, 
and a mature supply chain for critical 
materials.

y The hub would benefit from a 

vibrant innovation ecosystem, 
including a research consortium 
that fosters collaboration across 
institutional lines, a joint-venture/
start-up network that leverages 
existing assets and demand in the 
region, a testing facility to scale and 
commercialize new technologies, and
local equipment manufacturing.
y Meeting the hub’s talent needs 
would require implementing 
equitable workforce development 
programs. Community colleges, 
institutions of higher education, and 

companies could all play key roles 
in training the workforce for the 
hydrogen economy.

Next steps
The next phase of this work will build 
on the findings presented in this report 
to develop a demand-centric roadmap 
for 2022-2030. More specifically, the 
next phase will identify the sectors 
that are ready to respond to net-
zero-driven demand signals for clean 
hydrogen and to projects that can 
meet demand via a network of supply, 
shared infrastructure, and storage. This 
phase will also explore hub funding 
requirements, sector-specific legal and 
regulatory unlocks, and ways to build 
the right coalition for an integrated 
effort to develop the hydrogen hub. 
Collectively, these actions will create 
the blueprint for Houston to navigate 
the energy transition and continue 
thriving as the energy capital of the 
world.

Supply2

Clean hydrogen production might 
emerge along various pathways, 
including electrolysis, natural gas 
reforming, and methane pyrolysis. 
These types of hydrogen are often 
depicted as colors, e.g., green, blue, 
and turquoise. However, the primary 
determinants of any pathway’s 
adoption are the cost and carbon 
intensity of hydrogen production. 
These factors would determine Texas' 
ability to compete economically and 
environmentally on the world stage as it 
seeks to become a clean hydrogen hub. 

This report is technology-agnostic 
on hydrogen production but focuses 
primarily on electrolysis-based1  
and natural-gas-based production 
pathways to illustrate the magnitude 
of potential cost reductions over time 
and the competitiveness of Texas’ clean 
hydrogen production. 

1. Global cost trajectory
Significant cost reductions in clean 
hydrogen production over the next 
30 years could fuel global adoption of 
hydrogen. 

Electrolysis-based hydrogen 
production costs on average could 
drop significantly by 2030.2  This cost 
reduction would be due primarily to 
the expected decrease in capex costs, 

as well as the scaling of electrolyzer 
systems. Other factors in production 
costs include continued advancements 
in renewable energy, i.e., falling 
levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and 
increasing capacity factors.3 

Natural-gas-based hydrogen 
production costs could also fall in 
the coming years. Steam methane 
reforming (SMR) is the dominant 
technology for creating hydrogen 
from natural gas. However, other 
technologies exist such as autothermal 
reforming (ATR), a type of natural-gas 
reforming technology with natural 
gas as feedstock. Carbon capture 
equipment can be added to both 
technologies. Carbon capture rates for 
SMR and ATR have improved, further 
reducing emissions; and the cost to 
capture each ton of carbon dioxide is 
expected to drop. ATR may be adopted 
more widely in the future due to the 
low carbon intensity of its hydrogen 
production, but SMR will likely remain 
common due to its current market 
share.

Several emerging technologies for 
producing hydrogen (e.g., methane 
pyrolysis, synthetic biology, and 
photocatalysis) might also develop. 
This report acknowledges that some 
of these technologies could become 

economically attractive and contribute 
to future hydrogen supply. 

For the purposes of developing a 
detailed economic view, this report 
focuses on the two clean hydrogen 
pathways currently projected to 
provide the largest share of supply  
in Texas.

2. Texas’ current cost of 
supply advantages
Texas currently produces 3.6 million 
tons per annum (MTPA), or a third of 
the country’s total annual hydrogen 
production.4 

Texas enjoys abundant natural 
resources (e.g., wind and natural 
gas), existing infrastructure (e.g., 
the largest network of hydrogen 
pipelines in the U.S.), favorable 
geological formations for storing 
hydrogen and CO2 (e.g., salt caverns 
and saline formations onshore and 
offshore), significant and concentrated 
industry demand (e.g., refining and 
petrochemicals along the U.S. Gulf 
Coast), and a highly skilled workforce 
(e.g., oil and gas and manufacturing 
expertise) – all of which could support 
hydrogen production from both 
electrolysis-based and natural gas-
based pathways. 

Abundant natural resources: West 

1  For the purposes of this paper, electrolysis-based is defined as hydrogen produced using renewable energy, i.e., this excludes hydrogen produced via 

electrolysis using nuclear power and other sources of energy.

Texas enjoys some of the strongest, 
sustained wind speeds in the country, 
allowing Texas to produce abundant and 
cheap renewable wind energy. Texas 
produces the most wind-powered 
generation in the United States.5 This 
gives Texas a strong advantage in 
producing clean hydrogen through 
electrolysis, as electricity is the single 
largest cost driver. 

West Texas does not have easy access 
to water, but the cost savings from 
abundant and reliable wind are far larger 
than the cost of transporting water 
to the region. For example, increasing 
the cost of water five-fold (from, say, 
$0.50/m3 to $2.50/m3) increases the 
total cost of hydrogen by less than 1%.6 

The United States enjoys some 
of the lowest natural gas prices in 
the world. Furthermore, Texas has 
cheaper natural gas than the rest of the 
country. According to the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA), the 
price of natural gas used by power 
producers in Texas has been ~9% lower 
than the rest of the country since the 
EIA started tracking this data in 1997.7  
Low prices give Texas a substantial 
competitive advantage since natural 
gas is the largest cost component in 
producing hydrogen from natural-gas-
based pathways. 

Existing infrastructure: Pipelines 
are the most economical means of 
transporting hydrogen locally and 
regionally, while transportation 
by sea is more competitive for 
transcontinental distances.8 9

pipeline owners/operators (primarily 
large, industrial gas companies) and 
their industrial clients. This existing 
infrastructure points to a competitive 
advantage in the form of knowledge 
and expertise with respect to hydrogen 
pipelines. Texas also has one of the 
nation’s most extensive networks 
of natural gas pipelines, which can 
potentially be repurposed to transport 
hydrogen. 11

Favorable geological formations: The 
Texas Gulf Coast also has salt caverns 
that can store hydrogen and carbon 
dioxide for extended periods of time. 
Texas has three of the four operational 
salt caverns in the world used for 
hydrogen storage. ConocoPhillips has 
been storing hydrogen in the Clemens 
Dome, about 850 meters underground, 
since 1983. Air Liquide stores hydrogen 
in Spindletop, the largest salt cavern on 
the Gulf Coast. Praxair uses the Moss 
Bluff salt cavern, which is connected to 
a hydrogen pipeline network. These  
caverns have working storage of 
82 GWh, 278 GWh, and 125 GWh, 
respectively.12  13

The Gulf Coast region also has the 
largest saline formation capacity 
for storing CO2 in the United States. 
This onshore and offshore capacity is 
estimated at one trillion tons, or the 
capacity needed to store 10,000 times 
Houston’s current annual emissions.14

7

Both Texas and the federal government 
have a role to play in developing 
offshore CO2 storage. Texas is uniquely 
situated to take advantage of this 
capacity because it has jurisdiction 
over the first ten miles of shelf from its 
shoreline, while most states control 
only about three miles.15 There is an 
opportunity to collaborate with the 
federal government in deeper  
offshore waters.

Concentrated industry demand: 
Texas is likely to be a demand hub for 
hydrogen given its high share of U.S. 
industrial activities and population 
growth, as seen in potential demand 
clusters such as Greater Houston, 
Corpus Christi, and the Texas Triangle. 
Proximity to demand could help 
hydrogen producers in the region drive 
early adoption.

Highly skilled workforce and advanced 
research: Texas boasts a highly skilled 
workforce and a sophisticated, in-state 
manufacturing network that could help 
build the needed infrastructure for the 
hydrogen economy at a competitive 
cost. 

Texas also enjoys a high concentration 
of academic research and industry-
driven innovation. An estimated 300 
researchers at major Texas universities 
are working on hydrogen-related 
projects, and the state has more 
certified hydrogen pipeline inspectors 
than other states. 

Given the abundance of workers’ 
development programs and talent 
pipelines for the energy industry, 
Texas could readily deploy significant 
training and education to create jobs 
in clean hydrogen. These programs 
should continue to prioritize targeting 
disadvantaged communities.

A. Cost of production

Pathway #1: Electrolysis-based 
pathways

The primary technologies for producing 
hydrogen via electrolysis today include 
alkaline, proton exchange membrane 
(PEM) and solid oxide electrolyzer cell 
(SOEC). In 2020, alkaline accounted 
for ~60% of installed capacity and 
PEM accounted for ~30%.16 SOEC and 
emerging technologies accounted for 
the rest.

Alkaline is a mature and durable 
commercial technology that does not 
use precious materials and is well  
suited for large-scale deployment   
(>10 MW) through 2030. PEM 
electrolyzers are capable of being used 
for large-scale deployments as well as 
smaller applications. 

3. Trajectory of Texas’  
cost of supply
The hydrogen value chain involves a 
complex set of components, regardless 
of the production pathway. Costs differ 
across the value chain, and any cost 
analysis must make choices about 
what to include and what to exclude. 
These choices help frame which inputs 
to include when calculating hydrogen 
“cost of supply” in Texas.

This report attempts to be explicit 
about which costs (e.g., capital 
expenditures and operating 
expenditures) are included or excluded 
and why. Comparison with other 
analyses, or analysis of a different 
project scope, might require adjusting 
this approach.

Additionally, the report takes a 
“modular” approach to examining 
costs discretely along the value chain, 
meaning that the analysis looks at 
production, transport, and storage 
costs separately.

Key assumptions
• Hydrogen production costs exclude hydrogen transport and

storage costs

• No carbon pricing or subsidies (e.g., PTC, 45Q) unless otherwise noted
• All pathways (including those not represented here) can play a role in
developing Texas into a hydrogen hub. Alkaline and ATR were chosen
as representative technologies to highlight Texas’ cost advantages
• Hydrogen production costs include compression to 30 bar in capex
• Electrolysis-based hydrogen production assumptions:

Electricity cost which uses the top quartile of TX wind (assumes 
co-location of renewables and production, i.e., no T&D costs): 
$28/MWh in 2020, $21/MWh in 2030

For alkaline electrolysis: assumes a system of ~2 MW in 2020, ~20 
MW in 2025, and ~85 MW system in 2030-50

For PEM electrolysis: assumes a system of ~2 MW in 2020, ~20 MW 
in 2025, and ~85 MW system in 2030-50

• Natural-gas-based hydrogen production assumptions:

Industrial electricity prices average $0.07/kWh, natural gas costs 
between ~$2.5/MMBtu and ~$3/MMBtu from 2020 through 2050

Capex: includes capex for carbon capture but not transport or 
storage

Opex: CO2 transportation and CO2 storage is held constant at $6/ton 
and $10/ton, respectively; opex for carbon capture is included
ATR plant capacity = 500,000 Nm3/h; SMR plant capacity = 100,000 
Nm3/h; ATR and SMR have carbon capture rates of 98% and 
70%, respectively

The bulk of this analysis focuses on 
alkaline electrolyzers due to their 
lower projected cost curves through 
2030 compared to other electrolyzer 
technologies. (See Exhibit 6). In the long 
term, multiple electrolyzer technologies 
will play a key role in hydrogen production. 
PEM’s current materials include platinum, 
iridium, and titanium – expensive materials 
subject to supply and price fluctuations.17 
SOECs operate at a very high 
temperature, allowing the system to run 
on relatively inexpensive nickel electrodes 
and use some of the heat to reduce the 
electricity demands of electrolysis.18  Due 
to alkaline and PEM’s majority share of the 
current and near-term market, along with 
lower cost curves, this report has focused 
on these technologies.19 SOEC’s will likely 
play a role in the future, particularly for 
use in industrial sites where waste heat is 
available. 

The following analysis focuses 
exclusively on alkaline electrolysis as 
a technology representative of the 
broader electrolysis-based pathway. 
As individual projects come online, 
producers will likely evaluate site 
criteria, including the load profile of 
the local renewable electricity supply, 
to determine if batteries or alternative 
electrolyzer technologies would create 
the optimal production facility. 

Inclusions/exclusions: The electricity 
cost in this analysis is based on the 
levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for 
onshore wind energy generation. 
This portion of the analysis assumes 
behind-the-meter wind generation 
and co-location of renewable energy 
generation with hydrogen production, 
i.e., no transmission and distribution

costs of either electricity via wires or 
produced hydrogen via pipes. Those 
costs are discussed in section 2.3.B. 

The analysis assumes that the 
hydrogen producer will cover capital 
expenditures (capex)that include 
the cost of the electrolyzer system, 
transport to site, balance of plant, 
installation and assembly, cost of 
building, and indirect costs (e.g., labor 
and admin). The producer’s operating 
expenditures (opex) are assumed to 
include costs related to electricity, 
stack replacement, water,20 and the 
purification, drying, and compression 
of hydrogen post-production.

This production analysis does not 
include the cost of transporting water 
to the site, transporting or storing 
hydrogen, optimizing power costs by 
utilizing both wind and solar, or using 
the grid or batteries to manage the 

intermittency of renewable energy 
sources. The analysis also does not 
account for subsidies when calculating 
production costs, unless stated 
otherwise for sensitivity analyses. 
Furthermore, the analysis does not 
assume any tax on carbon emissions.

By excluding these costs, the analysis 
highlights the production process, 
which allows for apples-to-apples 
cost comparisons across production 
estimates for different years and regions. 

Inputs: The single greatest cost 
in electrolysis-based hydrogen 
production is the cost of electricity, 
which is represented by LCOE in this 
analysis. This report estimates that 
the average LCOE of wind without the 
Production Tax Credit (PTC) in Texas21 
could drop from $28/MWh in 2020 to 
$21/MWh in 2030, with continuous 
decline in wind capex.

The analysis also assumes a capacity 
factor of 46% in 2020 and 51% in 2030 
with a growing electrolyzer system 
of ~ 2MW in 2020 to ~20 MW in 2025 
to ~85 MW in 2030 through 2050. This 
scenario’s LCOE incorporates the top 
quartile of Texas’ wind speed, which is 
primarily wind resources in West Texas. 

Outputs: Based on these assumptions, 
the analysis predicts that the cost of 
electrolysis-based hydrogen in Texas 
could be ~$3.2/kg in 2020, ~$1.5/kg in 
2030, and ~$1./kg in 2050. 

Sensitivity to changes in LCOEs 

However, considering that inputs are 
subject to change, the analysis takes 
into account the possibility of higher 
LCOEs for Texas in order to offer a 
range of potential electrolysis-based 
hydrogen production costs. 

To do so, the analysis uses two Texas-
specific scenarios: Scenario A (high 
LCOE) and Scenario B (low LCOE). 

Scenario A estimates that the average 
LCOE of wind without PTC in Texas 
could be ~$37/MWh in 2020 and ~$26/
MWh in 2030. The capacity factor 
is assumed to be 34% in 2020 and 
39% in 2030 with the same growing 
electrolyzer system as in the low-LCOE 
scenario. This scenario’s LCOE  
reflects a general average of all Texas’ 
wind speed.

For Scenario B, the assumptions are the 
same as before with LCOEs of  
$28/MWh in 2020 and $21/MWh in 2030 
and a capacity factor of 46% in 2020 and 
51% in 2030.    

Output22:  Texas’ electrolysis-based 
hydrogen production costs could 
range from ~$3.2 to ~$4.3 / kg in 2020 
and ~$1.5 to ~$1.9/ kg in 2030. These 
reductions are attributable largely to 
declining costs for renewable wind 
energy, further reductions in the cost of 
electrolyzer systems, and the assumed 
increase in electrolyzer system size 
from ~2 MW in 2020 to ~20 MW in 2025 
to ~85 MW in 2030 through 2050. 
Increasing system sizes were used 
to better reflect the likelihood that 
electrolyzer systems will continue to 
scale in the coming years.

Other considerations: The above 
analysis assumes behind-the-meter 
power supply only. However, there 
is an opportunity to drive electricity 
cost optimization enabled by the 
ERCOT market structure, which does 
not currently have a forward capacity 
market. ERCOT has a unique way of 
measuring peak power: The ERCOT 
market essentially charges for use 
of the electric grid based on a user’s 
volumes during times when the grid is 
most strained. 

While the above analysis does not 
account for these features of the 
ERCOT market, this structure could be 
a competitive differentiator for clean 
electrolysis-based hydrogen in Texas 
in three ways.

22   For comparison, the system size costs used in this analysis are in line with other public reports:

y By curtailing demand during those 
periods when ERCOT is measuring 
power for grid cost allocation, 
electrolyzer users can significantly 
avoid network costs

y Using less energy for hydrogen 

production during high-priced hours 
and selling unused energy back to the 
ERCOT ancillary markets can further 
reduce costs

y Turning off electrolyzers during 

extremely high-priced hours can help
optimize costs 

While high-priced hours are not 
common, they can have an outsized 
impact on economics when they do 
occur, even for short durations. These 
events are part of ERCOT’s energy-only 
market structure and are needed to 
support investment in new generation 
assets. 

Participation in such high-priced 
events can be lucrative. While the cap 
on energy prices was recently reduced 
from $9,000/MWh to $5,000/MWh,23 
wholesale energy prices over $1,000/
MWh have occurred during 41 hours 
over the past three years.24 On the 
other hand, ERCOT grid connections 
could increase the carbon intensity of 
produced hydrogen since the grid is not 
100% powered by renewable energy.

Pathway #2: Natural-gas-based 
pathways with carbon capture 

Multiple technologies exist today for 
producing hydrogen via natural gas with 
carbon capture, and storage (CCS). 
Steam methane reforming (SMR) and 
autothermal reforming (ATR) currently 
have the highest technology-readiness 
levels. Both processes mix natural gas 
with high-temperature steam to create 
hydrogen and (ultimately) carbon 
dioxide. 

SMR is the dominant technology used 
today. Traditional SMR uses external 
heating, leading to CO2 creation both 
inside the reactor (~70%) and outside 
the reactor (~30%). In the traditional 
SMR process, the CO2 created inside 
the reactor is captured relatively 
easily, but the CO2 outside the reactor 
is harder (and more expensive) to 
capture. Modern SMR designs are based 
on limiting the CO2 creation through 
heat of combustion and creating a 
single CO2 rich stream for efficient 
carbon capture. As a result, SMRs with 
CCS could have a CO2 capture rate of 
70-95%, depending on whether older 
or newer versions of the technology are 
being deployed. 

ATR is typically somewhat less efficient 
than SMR. However, depending on the 
needs for process preheat through heat 
of combustion, high levels of CO2 can be 
generated inside the primary reactor, 
providing the potential for 

a relatively pure stream of CO2 for 
capture. ATR can lead to CO2 capture 
rates of 98%. ATR will be a more suitable 
solution for large system sizes; SMR 
will tend to be adopted in size ranges 
below 300,000 Nm3/h since ATR can be 
less efficient at these ranges. Whether 
retrofitting existing SMRs with carbon 
capture is more economical than 
replacing a SMR plant with a new ATR 
plant requires further analysis and will 
likely vary from plant to plant depending 
on capacity.

Inclusions/exclusions: Natural-
gas-based hydrogen production, as 
modeled, has four main components: 
hydrogen production, carbon capture, 
carbon transportation, and carbon 
storage. For hydrogen production, this 
analysis assumes stable, low natural 
gas prices in Texas; ERCOT industrial 
electricity prices; and purification, 
drying, and compression of hydrogen 
post-production. For carbon

capture, this analysis assumes that 
the producer is responsible for both 
capital expenditures and operating 
expenditures. The capex includes the 
plant (considering ATR as the base 
case), carbon capture system on 
site, and other capex (e.g., catalyst, 
balance of plant/utility, installation, and 
assembly). Operating expenditures 
include electricity costs. 

For carbon transportation and 
storage, the analysis assumes that 
the producer is responsible only for 
the operating expenditures of using 
the pipelines, not for the capital cost 
of building them. These assumed 
expenditures are the equivalent of 
a transportation and storage fee. 
This exclusion allows the analysis to 
focus on production costs, thereby 
allowing for better apples-to-apples 
cost comparisons across production 
estimates for different years  
and regions.  

Inputs: The below analysis assumes 
that the operating costs for CO2 
transportation and CO2 storage remain 
constant at $6/ton and $10/ton, 
respectively.25 Natural gas is assumed 
to cost between ~$2.5/MMBtu and ~$3/
MMBtu from 2020 through 2050.  This 
estimate is based on Henry Hub and 
assumptions about available North 
American gas supply through 2050.26 
Industrial electricity prices are assumed 
to average $0.07/kWh for all the years 
studied.27  

The analysis examines both ATR with 
CCS and SMR with CCS. ATR and SMR 
have different advantages at different 
scales. For the purposes of this analysis, 
ATR plant capacity is assumed to be 

500,000 Nm3/h with a carbon capture 
rate of 98% and the SMR plant capacity 
is assumed to be 100,000 Nm3/h with 
a carbon capture rate of 70%. These 
assumptions matter because the size 
of the plant, (and its corresponding 
efficiencies at scale), and the amount of 
carbon captured, (i.e., how much must be 
transported and stored), affect the price 
of each kilogram of hydrogen produced.

The carbon capture rate of 70% was 
chosen because this represents the 
conventional way for traditional SMR 
units to reduce the carbon intensity 
of hydrogen. In the future, alternative 
cost-efficient means may be developed 
to increase SMR’s capture rates to 
approach those anticipated of ATR, 
thereby maintaining SMR’s relevancy 
as a viable alternative for smaller scale 
blue hydrogen production.28

This analysis incorporates the tax 
credit known as 45Q as defined by 
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for 
captured and stored CO2, meaning the 
credit increases from ~$32/ton of CO2 
to $50/ton of CO2 in 2026 and remains 
constant through 2038. This federal tax 
credit could substantially decrease the 
cost of natural-gas-based hydrogen 
production. Using these carbon capture 
assumptions, the model incorporates a 
credit for SMR with CCS of ~$0.2/kg in 
2020 and ~$0.3/kg in 2030, and for ATR, 
the credit is ~$0.3/kg in 2020 and  
~$0.4/kg in 2030.  

Outputs: Based on an SMR plant 
capacity of 100,000 Nm3/h with a 
carbon capture rate of 70%, this 
analysis estimates the cost of hydrogen 
via SMR at ~$1.2/kg in 2020 and ~$1.1/
kg in 2030.

• Plant capacity = 100,000 Nm3/h; natural gas = ~ $2.5-3/MMBtu; greenbuild
• Carbon capture rate of 70%; unabated CO2 emissions of ~9 kg CO2/kg H2
• Tax credit of ~$32/ton captured CO2; captured CO2 rate of ~6.5 kg CO2 / kg H2

• Plant capacity = 100,000 Nm3/h; natural gas 
= ~ $2.5-3/MMBtu; greenbuild
• Tax credit of $50/ton captured CO2; 
captured CO2 of ~6 kg CO2 / kg H2
• Tax credit = ~$0.3/kg H2

25   These numbers are the midpoint of estimated ranges. This analysis assumes pipeline to Galveston and ~50km offshore sequestration site in the 

Gulf of Mexico. Assumes offshore storage location, with low end of the range assuming the reuse of wells for storage while the high end of the range 
assumes significant rebuild is required. Only accounts for low cost of capture (with high purity stream). Assumes 25-year lifecycle.

26   Significant shale gas resources exist in North America with over 1500 TCF of technically recoverable resources estimated to exist below $3/

MMBtu; these reserves are estimated to be sufficient to meet 20+ years of North American demand. Long-term availability of low-cost gas may be 
challenged, however, by midstream constraints, resulting in the sourcing of gas from more expensive basins.

Beyond 2030, hydrogen production 
costs are expected to remain relatively 
stable with a slight reduction to just 
over an estimated ~$1/kg in 2050 
without tax credits.  Natural gas 
represents the largest cost, which is 
estimated in this analysis to remain 
stable in the long run but might vary 
significantly in any given year. 

Based on an ATR plant capacity of 
500,000 Nm3/h with a carbon capture 
rate of 98%, this analysis estimates 
the cost of hydrogen via ATR with CCS 
at ~$1/kg in 2020 and almost the same 
at ~$1/kg in 2030. The 45Q tax credit 

reforming natural gas and  
lowering emissions per kilogram 
of hydrogen produced. Capital 
expenditures might fall slightly due 
to technological advancements and 
expected future investment as ATR 
becomes more common.29  Operating 
expenditures are expected to increase 
through 2050. Natural-gas-based 
hydrogen facilities will depend 
increasingly on electrification for the 
ATR heating process (instead of burning 
natural gas as a heat source). 

For both the SMR and ATR pathways, 
this analysis assumes produced 
hydrogen is pressurized at 30 bar, 
meaning additional compression 
costs could be needed for pipeline 

Hub, as noted above. However, 
predicting any energy commodity 
is difficult, and prices could change 
substantially year to year. Exhibit 12 
shows the natural gas price sensitivity 
for hydrogen production. For 2020 
and 2030, hydrogen production costs 
include natural gas prices ranging 
from $2.5/MMBtu to $4.5/MMBtu. If 
natural gas cost $2.5/MMBtu in 2030, 
for example, the analysis projects that 
hydrogen production could cost ~$1/kg 
via ATR with CCS and ~$1.1/kg via SMR 
with CCS. But, if natural gas cost $4.5/
MMBtu in 2030, hydrogen production 
costs could jump to ~$1.3/kg and ~$1.5/
kg, respectively. Natural-gas-based 
hydrogen production costs will increase 
as natural gas prices rise.

estimated ~$1/kg in 2050 without tax

From 2030 to 2050, ATR with CCS is 
expected to see efficiency gains in 

transmission, trucking, or storage. This 
analysis does not assume any tax on 
carbon emissions.

foreseeable future based on Henry 

Meeting the DOE’s goal of $1/kg for 
clean hydrogen

The above analysis illustrates how the 
costs of different hydrogen production  
pathways vary with natural gas prices. At 
the low end, both SMR with CCS and ATR 
with CCS can approach $1/kg of H2 in 2030. 
But these production costs will depend on 
the size of the plant, the amount of carbon 
captured, and the natural gas price.

Conclusion
Electrolysis-based hydrogen production costs will 
reach parity with natural-gas-based hydrogen after 
2045 even with PTC and 45Q. If either of these tax 
credits were extended beyond 2030 and 2038, 
respectively, this point of parity could change.

ATR with CCS, as modeled in this 
analysis, could meet the DOE’s 
Hydrogen Shot, which seeks to reduce 
the cost of clean hydrogen – defined as 
producing no more than two kilograms 
of CO2 / kilogram of produced hydrogen 
– to $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade  
("1 1 1").30  The analysis projects that 
the cost of hydrogen produced via ATR 
with CCS in Texas could reach ~$1/
kg by 2030 with ~0.2 kg CO2 / kg H2 
(measured at the point of production, 
as incorporated within the definition of 
Scope 1 emissions ).31 

The small SMR with CCS plants 
modeled here did not reach the DOE’s 
targets. Its expected production cost 
was ~$1.1/kg with emissions of ~3 kg of 
CO2 / kg of hydrogen, based on a 70% 
capture rate. However, improvements 
on SMR technology could allow the 

DOE’s goals to be reached.

The electrolysis-based pathway 
discussed above will likely fall short 
of the DOE’s targets. The cost of 
hydrogen produced via alkaline in Texas 
is projected to reach ~$1.5/kg by 2030. 

Tax policies supporting both 
production pathways can assist 
in meeting DOE’s clean hydrogen 
cost targets. For example, federal 
tax credits, such as the wind PTC, 
could help lower costs dramatically 
for electrolysis-based hydrogen 
production. Assuming that the wind 
PTC is extended through 2030, 
at-scale electrolysis-based hydrogen 
production costs could reach ~$1.1/kg  
in 2030.

For natural gas-based hydrogen 
production, the 45Q tax credit could 
substantially lower the cost of clean 
hydrogen. Without 45Q, the cost of ATR 
with CCS looks largely flat at ~$1/kg. 
With 45Q, the cost decreases by ~$0.3/
kg in 2020 and by ~$0.4/kg in 2030.32 

Achieving the DOE’s goal of $1/kg 
of electrolysis-based hydrogen by 
2030 would require decreasing capital 
expenditures by at least 20%, assuming 
an LCOE of $14/MWh and a wind PTC 
extension through 2030.33 

Pathway #3: Emerging technologies

While electrolysis-based and natural-
gas-based technologies are currently 
the two most common pathways 
for producing clean hydrogen, other 
pathways (e.g., methane pyrolysis, 
synthetic biology, and photocatalysis) 
could develop in the future. Emerging 
technologies could have a sizeable 
impact after 2035, provided these 
pathways get sufficient support and 
funding. 

B. Cost of transport and storage

The transportation and storage of 
hydrogen are critical elements of the 
hydrogen value chain. This section 
examines the costs associated with 
such transportation and storage.

Hydrogen transport 

Hydrogen transportation has two key 
components: the vehicle (e.g., truck, 
pipeline, or ship) and the carrier, or 
the form that the hydrogen will take 
(e.g., liquid hydrogen [LH2], ammonia, 
compressed gaseous hydrogen [CGH2],

   12/h2iq-12082021.pdf

31   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency defines Scope 1 emissions in the following way: “Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse (GHG) 

emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization (e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, 
furnaces, vehicles).”

and-scope-2-inventory-guidance

32   No subsidies: ATR with CCS is $1/kg; alkaline is $1.5/kg (based on reduced cost of wind power in Texas and improved electrolyzer economics; With  

   subsidies (in 2030): ATR with CCS is $0.6/kg with 45Q (no PTC for ATR); Alkaline is $1.1/kg with PTC; Carbon intensity kg CO2 per kg H2 (in 2030): ATR  
   with CCS = 0.2 (assuming 98% carbon capture rate)

or liquid organic hydrogen carriers34 
[LOHC]). All four carriers are currently 
viable low-carbon solutions. 

Methanol is also a potential hydrogen 
carrier due to its high hydrogen 
content (18.75% hydrogen by weight) 
and its ability to remain a stable liquid 
at most operating temperatures, 
thereby allowing it to be stored and 
transported with minimal additional 
operating costs. Methanol might 
provide a source of low-carbon fuel for 
the maritime industry moving forward. 
This possibility warrants further study, 
given the Gulf Coast’s existing port and 
petrochemical industries.

According to a 2019 DOE study,35  
methanol is more cost-effective for 
transporting hydrogen from the Gulf 
Coast to California than conventional 
ammonia and hydrogen. But the 
report did not account for the cost of 
producing clean hydrogen or consider 
the carbon intensity of each pathway. 
The cost and lifecycle emissions of 
bio-methanol and green methanol as 
carriers need further study. 

Trucking: Trucking LH2 or CGH2 can be 
expensive but suitable for handling low 
or variable demand, such as at hydrogen 
refueling stations, or bridging the gap 
before constructing a pipeline. Texas 
has a high-density trucking market 
and enjoys multiple interstate highway 
corridors.

distances (0-500 km), retrofitted

pipelines could achieve very low 
transport costs, below $0.1/kg for 
up to 500 km of distance traveled.36  
Achieving costs in this range would 
depend on the availability of existing 
pipelines and their suitability for 
retrofitting as well as on transporting 
high volumes of hydrogen to ensure 
high utilization rates. Retrofitting can 
save 60-90% of the cost of new pipeline 
development.37 

At long distances (>1,000km), 
onshore and undersea pipelines could 
transport hydrogen. The costs of 
pipelines can vary greatly. Based on 
European examples of repurposed 
existing infrastructure,38 capex costs 

for onshore transmission networks, 
including compression, would range 
from $0.6 million/km to $1.2 million/km 
for retrofit and from $2.2 million/km to 
$4.5 million/km for new build, resulting 
in a range of hydrogen transport costs 
of ~$0.10-0.25/kg for each 1,000km.39 
Undersea transmission pipeline costs 
would be 1.3-2.3 times higher, given the 
challenges of undersea construction 
and operation for both the retrofit and 
new build options.

Distribution pipelines could become 
relevant when hydrogen demand in 
buildings exceeds the natural gas 
blending threshold. These distribution 
pipelines would cost much less on a

per kilometer basis than transmission 
pipelines, considering the lower 
pressure and smaller size involved.

Shipping: Hydrogen shipping could 
be competitive with pipelines for 
distances >1,000km, and they are 
more suitable for transcontinental 
distances (>5,000km). LH2, LOHC, and 
ammonia are the carriers with the most 
traction. By 2030, carrier shipping costs 
could cost $2-3/kg, assuming at-scale 
infrastructure for production and 
shipping.40

Both pipelines and shipping have 
advantages and disadvantages. The 
optimal choice depends on use-case 
needs, transportation requirements 
after landing at port, and storage 
time.

Establishing an advantage in marine 
shipping costs might be challenging 
since importing locations determine 
the costs at port: Costs for processes 
such as cracking and purification (for 
ammonia) or dehydrogenation41 (for 
LOHC), depend on the importing 
countries’ electricity costs, which could 
be high, and the availability of large-
scale plants near port. 

Hydrogen liquefaction: Since 
liquefaction increases hydrogen’s 
storage density, liquid hydrogen 
could meet the growing demand for 
low-carbon hydrogen in mobility 
(such as heavy duty trucks and fuel 
cell locomotives) and as a storage 
solution in several different ways. First, 
distributing liquid by truck, today’s 
predominant distribution mode, 
provides between 10-12 times more 
storage capacity compared to tube 
trailers at various pressures. Moving 
hydrogen via rail in 30,000-gallon rail 
cars in the future will require liquid

hydrogen. Second, on-board liquid 
hydrogen storage provides sufficient 
density to allow for long-distance 
trucking without refueling (1000+ 
miles) and for fuel cell locomotives. 
Finally, at hydrogen refueling stations, 
liquid storage could replace high-
pressure gaseous storage since 
more molecules can be compressed 
and since liquid hydrogen pumps 
consume less electricity. In addition, 
hydrogen liquefiers, liquid hydrogen 
storage tanks, and heat exchangers 
for hydrogen liquefaction units can be 
made in the United States. 

Hydrogen Storage

Selecting a storage option should take 
into account volume, duration, the 
required speed of discharge, and the 
availability of geological options. Texas 
has both geological and engineered 
options.

Geological storage would be the 
best option for large-scale, long-
term hydrogen storage that could 
bridge seasonal changes in electricity 
supply or provide system resilience. 
Salt caverns, depleted oil and gas 
reservoirs, and water aquifers are three 
options that warrant consideration. 

losses or contamination. For further 
use in FCEVs and other high-purity 
applications, hydrogen stored in salt 
caverns, depleted fields, or saline 
aquifers would likely require additional 
processing. 

Engineered storage tanks are best for 
small-scale applications and short-to-
medium time frames, including hourly 
storage for hydrogen refueling stations 
and days or weeks for industrial 
applications to protect against short-
term mismatches in demand and 
supply. Tanks typically store CGH2 or 
LH2 with high discharge rates and enjoy 
efficiencies of ~99%.45  

are in Texas, with total capacity of 485 
GWh43 (over 14,500 MT). The local cost 
of cavern storage could be as low as 
$0.2/kg of hydrogen.44 

Hydrogen storage in depleted oil and 
gas reservoirs and aquifers is less 
mature, with a TRL of two in 2021. 
Depleted reservoirs are typically 
larger than salt caverns and offer high 
storage capacity but need to be proven 
feasible for hydrogen storage. Texas 
has abundant capacity of depleted 
oil and gas reservoir storage, which 
could be good candidates for long-
term cycling if their ability as hydrogen 
storage units is proven feasible. Saline 
aquifers require additional site-specific 
characterization work to determine 
feasibility.

4. Texas’ export 
competitiveness
Local production costs are one of the 
most significant factors in exporting 
clean hydrogen: These costs vary 
considerably across geographies 
and technologies with electricity and 
natural gas representing the largest 
cost inputs for the two pathways 
modeled here. The analysis puts 
Texas’ electrolysis-based hydrogen 
production cost in 2030 at ~$1.5/kg 
in the base case, but this cost could 
increase up to $1.9/kg (as discussed 
in section 2.3.A). This range could 
be competitive with Chile and Saudi 
Arabia; Texas’ modeled natural-gas-
based hydrogen production cost in 
2030 is ~$1/kg but could increase up to 
$1.3/kg for ATR with CCS if natural gas 
prices were to rise (see Exhibit 12). This 
range could be competitive with other 
countries’ natural-gas-based hydrogen 
exports.       

The production costs above are 
representative of an alkaline 
electrolyzer system size of ~85 
MW size. Differences in capex and 
other opex reflect different annual 
production outputs as each system 
assumes a dedicated behind-the-meter 
renewable energy system, which is in 
turn affected by the renewable energy 
resources available in each region.

Transportation costs are also a 
significant consideration in export: 
While Australia and Saudi Arabia are 
geographicaly closer to likely hydrogen 
demand centers such as Japan and 
the European Union, respectively, 
Texas could potentially compete on 
landed cost. The estimated cost at 
harbor for electrolysis-based hydrogen 
transported to Europe or Japan, 
as ammonia or LOHC, is similar for 
Texas, Australia, and Saudi Arabia. The 
following ammonification costs are 
in line with existing green ammonia

1. For applications where ammonia can be used directly (e.g., marine fuel, coal blending), ammonia is a lower delivered cost than LOHC;   2. Unlike LH2, ammonia and LOHC shipping

costs are less sensitive to distance because they incur lower hydrogen losses. Import and export fees are a significant portion of shipping costs not correlated to distance whereas
ship rental, fuel (assuming global HFO averages), and labor costs are correlated with distance; 3. Conversion process costs after landing are determined by hydrogen loss costs and
importing country’s fuel and electricity costs

efforts to diversify its sources of 
natural gas imports and accelerate 
hydrogen uptake); the potential for cost 
optimization (e.g., taking advantage 
of natural gas price fluctuations in 
different regions); the speed of capital 
deployment and capacity build (e.g., 
Texas might achieve scale earlier 
than Saudi Arabia and Australia); 
stability through diversification 
and more predictable sources; and 
long-term offtake agreements that 
create a potential vehicle for trade 
collaboration. 

In many ways, the market for hydrogen 
exports could resemble the evolution 
of the liquified natural gas (LNG) 
market. Similar to LNG, supply-based 
hydrogen hubs such as in the Middle 
East, Australia, and North America 
could compete to serve demand in 
East Asia (e.g., Japan and South Korea). 
Given the cost assumptions, Texas is 
likely to leverage its cost and strategic 
advantages to export hydrogen and its 
derivative products.

production costs from the International 
Energy Agency (IEA) and the DOE 
when accounting for similarly scaled 
projects.46

Three main factors explain Texas’ cost 
competitiveness on marine transport:
 y Shipping costs for ammonia and 
LOHC are not very sensitive to 
distance (boil-off makes liquid  
hydrogen shipping costs more 
sensitive to distance).47

 y The value of hydrogen losses in both 
processing and shipping depends  
on production costs in the exporting 
country; costs in Texas are  
relatively low.

 y The cost for end-of-journey 

processing (e.g., ammonia cracking 
and purification and LOHC 
dehydrogenation) that takes place 
in the importing country accounts 
for a large portion of transport costs 
and is not necessarily affected by the 
exporting country.48 

This export analysis does not include 
the costs of transport or intermediate 
storage when moving electrolysis-
based hydrogen from West Texas to 
demand centers along the Gulf Coast.
However, most conversion sites and 
facilities (e.g., liquefaction, ammonia, 
and truck centers) incorporate storage 
or will draw multiple sources for use  
at scale.

Beyond production and transport 
cost advantages, several non-cost 
strategic considerations could make 
Texas an attractive choice for export. 
These include geopolitical and national 
security considerations (e.g., Europe’s

Demand3

This chapter highlights expected 
global hydrogen demand and hydrogen 
demand in Texas across a variety of 
applications, including industrial, 
mobility, power and heat, and exports. 
This chapter assesses whether Texas’ 
supply advantages can potentially be 
paired with corresponding demand 
signals. These applications were 
selected for their relevance to the 
region and for their potential growth 
through 2050.

1. Global demand
The world is racing to cut emissions. 
More than 130 countries have set, or 
are considering, a target of net-zero 
emissions by 2050 to limit global 
warming to 1.5⁰C.1 Clean hydrogen 
offers a long-term, scalable option 
for decarbonization in hard-to-abate 
sectors, complementing renewable 
power, biofuels, and energy efficiency 
improvements. With an estimated 
abatement potential of 7 GT of CO2 in 
2050, hydrogen could contribute 20% 
of the total global abatement needed 
in 2050.2

Global demand for hydrogen is 
expected to grow at an average rate 
of 4-6% per year between 2020-
30, accelerating to 6-8% per year 
between 2030-50: Hydrogen demand 

could reach 540 MTPA in 2050 in 
the Further Acceleration scenario 
(see below). With more aggressive 
regulatory requirements and policy 
support, hydrogen demand could 
reach ~660 MTPA in 2050.3 The overall 
market, including related technologies 
such as electrolysis and fuel cell 
equipment, could top $2.5 trillion by 
2050.4

Demand signals are core to creating 
demand use cases based on a specific 
industry need. Each demand signal, 
in turn, should spur the creation of a 
value chain that involves the supply 
of hydrogen and/or its derivate end 
products (e.g., ammonia and green 
steel). In fact, in some sectors  
(e.g., commercial aviation) the demand 
signal for low-carbon products vastly 
outstrips the current supply.

While the sheer economics of a green 
premium might deter potential buyers, 
net-zero targets and commitments 
might increase willingness to pay 
premiums. For example, net-zero 
commitments by automakers could lead 
to greater willingness to pay for “green 
steel,” enabling the steel industry to 
boost demand for clean hydrogen. 

The hub concept provides a forum for 
identifying a legitimate demand signal 
and activating a clean hydrogen value 
chain (of suppliers, off-takers, and 
others) through catalyzing projects 
that can grow organically to meet 
increases in demand. 

2. Texas’ priority use cases
Production of clean hydrogen from 
the Texas hub catchment area (the 
geographic boundary used for this 
analysis) could reach 5 MTPA by 2035 
and 11 MTPA by 2050 for meeting local 
demand, in addition to exporting 3 MTPA 
by 2035 and 10 MTPA by 2050: In 2050, 
Texas’ production of ~21 MTPA would be 
the equivalent of ~4% global hydrogen 
demand in 2050, well above Texas’ share 
of the global economy (~2% in 2019).5 

In 2050, export (~10 MTPA of hydrogen 
and hydrogen-based fuels) would be 
the largest driver of demand, followed 
by industrial applications (~6 MTPA 
including feedstock and heating 
applications), mobility (~4 MTPA for 
ground and marine transport and

aviation), and power and heating  
(~2 MTPA for utility power generation, 
energy storage, and natural gas 
blending for buildings). 

Sizing methodology: This analysis 
estimates that Texas has an export 
potential of ~10 MTPA, considering a 
range of 8-12 MTPA based on current 
market share of LNG exports and 
assuming Texas’ current percentage 
of global hydrogen production remains 
constant.6 The hydrogen would likely 
be exported in the form of ammonia or 
other hydrogen-based carriers.7 

A. Industrial applications

Catchment area: Hydrogen can be 
used in industrial applications as either 
a feedstock or a fuel. As a feedstock, 
hydrogen can be used in refining, 
petrochemicals, ammonia, iron, and 
steel. As a fuel, hydrogen can be used in 
high-grade heat applications in the iron, 
steel, cement, and chemical industries. 
Many organizations in these sectors 
have production facilities across Texas 
and Louisiana, and their corporate 
offices in the Houston area make 
purchasing decisions.

6  This analysis takes a top-down approach in determining the export potential for hydrogen from the Texas region by averaging two different 

methodologies. The first methodology assumes that Texas maintains its current share of hydrogen production, (estimated at ~4% today) and maintains 
that share through 2050. Assuming a global demand for hydrogen of 540 MTPA in 2050, Texas would be responsible for 23 MTPA, or ~12 MTPA after 
accounting for local demand. The second methodology assumes that a) Texas maintains its current share of liquified natural gas (LNG) exports at around 
8%, as reported by the EIA; and b) that around 20% of the estimated global 540 MTPA in 2050 is traded, as estimated by the IEA. This leads to a total MTPA 
from the Texas region of ~8 MTPA. Together, these methodologies lead to an estimated export potential of ~8-12 MTPA, or ~10 MTPA.

Therefore, both Texas and Louisiana 
are included in the Houston catchment 
area for industrial hydrogen demand.

Sizing methodology: The 2050 industrial 
demand sizing represents the full 
potential for hydrogen demand assuming 
that all facilities in the targeted use 
cases in Texas and Louisiana adopt clean 
hydrogen, unless otherwise noted. In this 
analysis, facility-level GHG emissions 
data from the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas 
Reporting Program (GHGRP)8 has been 
translated into hydrogen demand 
potential by application.9

The 2035 demand sizing reflects how 
much of the full potential is achievable, 
by application, by then. Texas’ large 
number of refining, petrochemical, 
and ammonia facilities could 
gradually adopt clean hydrogen by 
2030, creating substantial hydrogen 
demand. However, given the 
relatively small number of iron and 
steel and cement facilities in the region, 
these sectors will likely not be a major 
demand driver over the next 15 years.

Refining: Texas refineries have the 
capacity to process 5.9 million barrels of 
crude oil per day, according to the U.S. 
Energy Information Administration. 
As of January 2020, this amounted to 
~31% of total U.S. refining capacity.10 
The Houston area is home to ten 
refineries that collectively process 
more than 2.7 million barrels of crude oil 
per day, or ~14% of all U.S. production.11

Currently, oil refineries use about 
two-thirds of the ten million tons 
of on-purpose feedstock hydrogen 
produced each year in the U.S.12 

Oil refining will remain an important 
application of hydrogen, but as the 
energy transition decreases global 
demand for hydrocarbon liquids by 
2050, the long-term need for refining 
capacity will decline. In the Further 
Acceleration scenario, the global 
distillation capacity of 105 million 
barrels per day in 2019 will drop ~27% by 
2035 and ~55% by 2050.13 

The reduction of refining capacity in 
North America will be uneven. The 
United States Gulf Coast (USGC) 
enjoys significant advantages in 
this regard: highly complex assets 
(producing the highest-quality yields 
and achieving high margins), strong 
operating capabilities and system 
efficiencies (flagship facilities, talent, 
and infrastructure, including the 
existing hydrogen network), and better 
access to export markets than other  
North American refining locations. A 
larger share of capacity might close in 
the Midwest, the West Coast, Alaska, 
Hawaii,14 and Canada. Therefore, this 
analysis assumes 10% reduction of 
refining capacity in 2035 (vs. 2019), and 
30% in 2050, leading to demand for 
refining hydrogen of 2.0 MTPA in 2035 
and 1.6 MTPA in 2050.

Petrochemicals: Houston is responsible 
for more than 42% of U.S. petrochemicals 
capacity, according to the state of 
Texas.15 This production generates an 
estimated ~$40 billion in revenue each 
year.16 Petrochemicals are expected to 
remain a sizable application for clean 
hydrogen in 2050. The estimated total 
demand for clean hydrogen in the 
petrochemicals sector will reach 1.5 
MTPA in Texas and Louisiana by 2050, 
including, but not limited to, replacement 
of current demand for conventionally 
produced hydrogen; applications in 
methanol, nylon, and butanol production; 
and substitution for natural gas as a 
source of heat in petrochemicals. 

Ammonia: The total demand for clean 
hydrogen in ammonia manufacturing 
is expected to reach 1.2 MTPA in Texas 
and Louisiana by 2050, mostly in 
Louisiana. Leveraging low natural gas 
costs, the Gulf Coast region produces 
a significant amount of ammonia, used 
primarily in fertilizer production. Natural-
gas-based hydrogen production could 
serve this market and meet the demand 
for low-carbon products, at least until 
electrolysis-based hydrogen production 
costs decrease.

Ammonia could grow to meet other 
production requirements, including 
marine fuel (demand included in marine 
use case) and seaborne hydrogen 
transport (demand accounted for in 
other use cases). 

Iron and steel: The total demand for 
clean hydrogen in iron and steel is 
expected to reach 0.2 MTPA in Texas 
and Louisiana by 2050. Given that 
Texas already has highly advanced 
direct reduction plants, the state could 
lead the nation in the development of a 
low-carbon steel industry.

Direct reduction of iron (DRI) uses 
natural gas to produce steel with lower 
CO2 emissions compared to steel 
production that uses blast furnaces. 
The DRI process can use mixtures 
of reformed natural gas, i.e., carbon 
monoxide and hydrogen, or even 100% 
hydrogen to make the DRI. Experts 
suggest a 30% mix of hydrogen 
with natural gas is feasible without 
significantly altering the production 
process. The higher the proportion of 
green hydrogen that is used, the lower 
the CO2 emissions from the direct 
reduction process.17

Cement: Total demand for clean 
hydrogen in the cement sector is 
expected to reach 0.1 MTPA in Texas 
and Louisiana by 2050. Texas is home 
to the U.S. headquarters of CEMEX, 
which has already introduced hydrogen 
technology into the fuel mix of all its 
cement production facilities in Europe. 
CEMEX has announced plans to do 
the same in other facilities outside 
of Europe, making the company a 
potential user of hydrogen in the Texas 
region.18

concentration trucking markets, which 
would further reduce the cost of any 
new infrastructure.

Hydrogen fuel cells offer improvements 
over batteries in electric vehicles – in 
weight and fueling time – making 
hydrogen better suited to heavy-duty 
trucking and mining vehicles than 
batteries. Indeed, this report expects 
FCEVs in HDTs to break even with 
ICE vehicles in the U.S. by 2032, as 
measured by total cost of ownership 
per km-ton traveled. 

Texas could also develop hydrogen 
infrastructure at the Port of Houston, 
replacing diesel-powered trucks in port 
drayage with FCEVs. Drayage trucks 
are usually Class 8 heavy-duty diesel 
trucks, which are the single largest 
contributor to emissions of NOx among 
mobile sources. 

Industrial heating:19 Total demand for 
clean hydrogen for industrial heating 
is expected to reach 1.6 MTPA in 
Texas and Louisiana by 2050, with 1.1 
MT in Texas and 0.5 MT in Louisiana. 
Hydrogen could replace fossil fuels in 
high-grade heat applications (above 
500oC), which are used primarily by 
the iron, steel, plastics, and chemical 
industries. For low-grade heat (below 
100oC) and medium-grade heat (100-
500oC) applications, electrification 
is likely to be the preferred solution in 
most situations. 

Hydrogen could account for up to 5% of 
high-grade heat applications by 2035. 
By 2050, hydrogen could meet 20-25% 
of high-grade, 5-10% of medium-
grade, and up to 5% of low-grade heat 
and power requirements.20 Research 
and development of hydrogen-
compatible equipment is needed to 
enable further adoption. 

B. Mobility

Catchment area: The primary 
mobility applications of hydrogen 
include hydrogen fuel cell trucks, light 
commercial vehicles (LCVs), and buses. 
The report considers the entire state 
of Texas as the catchment area for 
hydrogen demand in mobility since 
infrastructure will need to be expanded 
across the state to service fuel cell  
electric vehicles (FCEV), such as trucks 

along I-10, I-45, and other corridors.

Sizing methodology: To size road 
transportation demand for hydrogen 
in 2050, this analysis replaces current 
demand for liquid fuels by LCVs, buses, 
and trucks21 with hydrogen.22  The sizing 
assumes an FCEV penetration in 2050 
of 12% for buses, 5% for LCVs, and 10% 
for heavy- and medium-duty trucks 
(HDTs and MDTs).23 The 2035 road 
transportation demand assumes FCEV 
penetration of 3% for buses, 3% for 
LCVs, and 6% for trucks.  

The demand sizing for marine transport 
assumes the following: that Houston’s 
regional hydrogen use as a share of U.S. 
marine hydrogen demand maintains 
its 6.8% share of U.S. port activity.24 
Energy consumption in marine 
transport is expected to be fulfilled 
by hydrogen at 2% in 2035 and 35% in 
2050.25

Heavy-duty trucks: Total demand for 
clean hydrogen in the Texas HDT sector 
is estimated to reach 2 MTPA by 2050, 
with ~25% of that demand materializing 
by 2035.

Heavy-duty trucks (HDT) represent an 
ideal application of hydrogen for the 
Texas region for the following reasons:

Trucking would need limited new 
infrastructure to supply hydrogen as 
a fuel. Texas already has several high-

19   Sizing methodology assumes Texas and Louisiana’s shares of total U.S. hydrogen demand from industrial heating (5MT in 2030, according to FCHEA  

   report) are proportional to their 2019 shares of U.S. industrial energy consumption of 22% and 9%, respectively.

made 2.1 million gate visits, collectively 
emitting 325 tons of NOx emissions.26 
As of late 2021, 10,000 trucks arrived at 
the port every day to unload more than 
280,000 containers.27 

Port drayage projects could also benefit 
disadvantaged communities. A report 
by the Natural Resources Defense 
Council and the Texas Environmental 
Justice Advocacy Services found that 
pollution disproportionately affected 
communities near the Houston Ship 
Channel. Hydrogen-powered trucks 
could reduce these emissions.28

Light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and 
buses: Total demand for clean hydrogen 
in the LCV and bus sector in Texas is 
estimated to reach 0.3 MTPA by 2050, 
with 20% of that demand materializing 
by 2035. The Houston area METRO 
has ~1,200 active buses in service 
today.29 These buses can be near-term 
candidates for electrification. Battery 
electric vehicles (BEVs) and FCEVs 
could decarbonize city and school buses 
almost completely by 2035. FCEVs could 
capture 60% of the city bus market, 
which runs daily trips of ~120 miles, by 
2030.30 This report does not expect LCVs 

to be a major use case for hydrogen, due 
primarily to the popularity of BEVs. In 
the LCV sector, FCEVs are expected to 
achieve cost parity with BEVs seven to 
ten years after BEVs achieve cost parity 
with ICE vehicles. By then, a large portion 
of the addressable market will likely have 
transitioned to BEVs.31

Marine: This report expects total demand 
for clean hydrogen in the marine sector in 
Texas to reach 0.4 MTPA by 2050, including 
0.3 MTPA for hydrogen-based fuels and 
0.1 MTPA for hydrogen fuel cell ships.

Demand for hydrogen in marine 
transport includes hydrogen fuel cell 
ships and hydrogen-based fuels, i.e., 
ammonia and methanol. The report 
estimates that hydrogen-based fuels 
could meet 60% of U.S. marine energy 
needs in 2050 with hydrogen fuel cells 
meeting 20% of that need, up from 9% 
and 7%, respectively, in 2035. 

Hydrogen fuel cells have limited 
marine applicability. While there have 
been demonstrations with coastal 
and short-distance vessels since the 
early 2000s, commercial operations 
of fuel cell vessels are nascent. The 
first fuel cell ferries only launched 
commercial operations in the U.S. and 
Norway in 2021.32 In addition, the low 

volumetric density of hydrogen limits 
its direct use to short- and medium-
range vessels, or those vessels with 
high power requirements that battery 
electrification cannot meet.33

In contrast, major industry stake-holders 
have announced plans to make 100% 
ammonia-fueled engines available as 
early as 2023 and plans to offer ammonia 
retrofit packages for existing vessels in 
2025.34 Methanol, another possibility, is 
more compatible with existing marine 
engines but has less decarbonization 
potential than ammonia. 

Aviation: Total demand for clean 
hydrogen in aviation in Texas is 
expected to reach 1.1 MTPA in 
2050,mostly serving synfuel production 
rather than hydrogen propulsion.

Aviation is one of today’s most carbon-
intensive industries. Airplane emissions 
reached almost one Gt in 2019, or 
~2.8% of the world’s total emissions, 
according to the IEA.35 

Texas is home to some of the busiest 
airports in the world. Almost 60 million 
people passed through Houston’s 
airports in 2019.36 Total jet fuel demand 
in Texas accounted for 9% of U.S. jet 
fuel demand in 2019.37

In this analysis, hydrogen demand in 
aviation includes demand for synthetic 
fuels (power-to-liquid) production 
and hydrogen propulsion. Demand 
estimates assume that synthetic fuels 
will meet 35% of U.S. aviation demand 
in 2050, and that hydrogen will meet 3% 
of that demand, up from 8% and 0%, 
respectively, in 2035.38

Production of synthetic fuels combines 
hydrogen with a carbon feedstock to 
create a kerosene-like fuel that current 
aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure 
can use as a drop-in fuel, meaning no 
major change to existing equipment 
is needed.39 While less mature today, 
hydrogen propulsion could fuel short- 
and medium-range aircrafts. Hydrogen 
propulsion with fuel-cell systems has the 
potential to reduce emissions by 75-90%, 
followed by hydrogen turbines at 50-75%, 
and synfuels with direct air capture at 
30-50%.40

In addition to airplanes, hydrogen has 
other airport applications, including 
buses, stationary power, ground 
support equipment, taxis, trains, and 
freight trucks.41

C. Power and heat

Catchment area: The primary power 
and heat applications of hydrogen 

include natural gas blending for utility 
power generation, building heating, 
and grid-scale energy storage. 
Utility-scale blending would require 
investment and coordination across 
the value chain, including upstream 
production, CCS, transmission 
infrastructure for natural-gas-
based hydrogen, renewable energy 
infrastructure, and electrolysis 
investment for electrolysis-based 
hydrogen. Such projects would 
benefit from state-level policy and 
coordination. Therefore, this report 
considers the entire state of Texas the 
catchment area for hydrogen demand 
in power and heat.

Sizing methodology: To size the 
demand for utility power generation 
and building heating, the analysis uses 
natural gas consumption by end use in 
Texas,42 assuming the same CAGR for 
natural gas in Texas as across the U.S.43 
The analysis assumes that blending by 
volume could reach 5% of natural gas 
demand in 2035 and 30% in 2050, with 
technical limitations. 

Pipelines designed to deliver natural gas 
can likely handle blends containing up 
to 20% hydrogen, by volume, with only 
modest modifications.44 Higher blends 
might require significant upgrades 

due in part to hydrogen’s chemical 
properties, which can embrittle steel 
pipelines and create concerns about 
backfiring.45 

In the following sections, the report 
sizes demand in three areas: utility 
power generation, energy storage, 
and buildings (both commercial and 
residential).

Utility power generation: Total 
demand for clean hydrogen in the utility 
power sector in Texas is expected to 
reach 1.1 MTPA by 2050. 

This demand estimate assumes 
achieving a 30% volume blend for all 
Texas natural gas demand in power 
generation in 2050, with a 5% volume 
blend in 2035. This estimate aligns with 
efforts underway by GE and Mitsubishi 
Power to retrofit existing turbines to 
handle 30% blends of hydrogen, by 
volume, starting in 2025.46 To handle 
high-hydrogen fuels, existing gas 
turbines might need to switch to a 
new combustion system because 
of hydrogen’s lower energy density 
by volume and higher flame speed, 
compared with natural gas.

In the short term, prioritizing blending 
near existing pipelines could reduce 
emissions. If every Texas power plant 
located within three miles of an existing 
hydrogen pipeline blended 5% of their 
natural gas, by volume, with zero-
carbon hydrogen, total emissions for 
these plants could drop 1.8 million 
tons per year. This reduction would be 
equivalent to removing almost 400,000 
cars from the road. A 30% blend would 
be equivalent to removing 2.3 million 
cars from the road.47

Building heating: Total demand for 
clean hydrogen in the buildings sector 
in Texas is expected to reach 0.5 MTPA 
by 2050.

This demand estimate assumes 
achieving a 30% volume blend for all 
Texas natural gas demand in residential 
and commercial buildings in 2050, 
with a 5% volume blend in 2035. While 
today’s home appliances likely cannot 
handle natural gas blends with a high 
percentage of hydrogen, this could 
be feasible by 2050. The demand for 
hydrogen blending would be limited 
because a large percentage of Texas 
buildings use electricity rather than 
natural gas. For example, six in ten 
Texas homes use electricity as their 
primary heating source, compared 
with the national average of four in ten 
homes, according to the EIA.48 

Energy storage: Texas could be a leader 
in storing excess renewable energy in 
the form of hydrogen due to its high 
generation of wind and solar power, 
abundant salt cavern storage options, 
and hydrogen pipeline network. 

As renewable energy becomes more 
common throughout Texas, the ERCOT 
power region might need long-duration 
energy storage (LDES) in the form of 
hydrogen. By 2035, ERCOT forecasts 
that renewable energy might constitute 
53% of the grid.49 Seasonal LDES would 
probably be required when the grid hits 
60-70% variable renewable energy, so 
Texas could see a significant hydrogen 
demand for LDES after 2035.50

Because the report expects most 
re-electrification of stored hydrogen 
to happen at natural gas-fired power 
plants,51 the analysis includes energy 
storage demand in the hydrogen 
demand estimated for natural gas 
blending related to power generation.

D. Export potential
Trade could account for 20% of total 
demand for global hydrogen and 
hydrogen-based fuel in 2050, according 
to the IEA.52 

Countries might import hydrogen for 
several reasons:

Renewable energy capacity might not 
be able to meet the domestic demand 
for both green electricity and hydrogen 
production. For example, Japan, 
Korea, central Europe, and large parts 
of the U.S. have limited wind and solar 
resources.

Local production might face high costs, 
likely driven by less favorable renewable 
generation costs or the high cost of 
natural gas.

Countries might have ambitious climate 
goals that rely on using hydrogen at 
a scale that exceeds their domestic 
production capabilities.

Japan, South Korea, and parts of 
Europe are likely to be net importers 
of hydrogen, while Australia and 
New Zealand, Chile, the Middle East, 
and North Africa are likely to be net 
exporters, according to the IEA. 
Hydrogen exporters could supply 1,800 
petajoules (PJs) to Asia by 2050, under 
today’s announced net-zero pledges.53

Given Texas’ competitiveness in 
production costs, delivered costs, 
and other strategic considerations, 
the state could become a major global 
export hub. By 2050, Texas could 
export 8-12 MTPA, assuming the state 
maintains its current share of global 
hydrogen production (~4%) or future 
exports match Texas’ current share of 
the global LNG export market (~8%).

Vision and strategic roadmap

The preceding chapters examined 
three critical factors in building a 
robust regional hydrogen hub: Texas’ 
advantages in hydrogen production and 
potential hydrogen demand. 

This chapter outlines the vision for 
building and expanding the hydrogen 
hub in Texas. The chapter includes 
guiding principles that shape the 
vision, the elements of the vision, 
and a strategic roadmap to deliver 
on the vision, including a focus on 
environmental justice. 

1. Guiding principles
Five guiding principles anchor the vision 
and roadmap for developing Texas into 
a hydrogen hub. 
 y Use demand to scale supply: Texas 
should fund and develop major 
drivers of demand to encourage 
market-based innovation on the 
supply side that could decrease 
costs and increase capacity. These 
efforts would complement Texas’ 
current research-based innovations 
in hydrogen technologies. 
Furthermore, developing multiple, 
replicable projects could accelerate 
scaling and manage risk more 
effectively than pursuing a single 
path within each driver of supply and 
demand. Texas, however, should 
also support supply to ensure that 
demand signals can be effectively 
met. 

 y Create a broad-based regional 

ecosystem: Texas should create a 
vibrant, well-connected ecosystem 
that brings together diverse supply 
sources, demand drivers, and 
coordinated transport and storage 
infrastructure. This approach 
should be comprehensive and foster 
collaboration across public, private, 
and academic institutions. 
 y Texas should also pioneer the 

development of two key enablers 
of the hydrogen economy that look 
beyond physical assets – a digital 
layer that would support open and 
transparent measurement of carbon 
emissions and the verification 
needed to level the playing field 
for competition among diverse 
production pathways;1 and a financial 
layer that supports trading hydrogen 
contracts, credits, and other 
instruments in a liquid market.
 y Focus on economic growth and 
emissions reduction: Texas 
should pursue economic growth 
and emissions reduction as fully 
as possible. To scale the hydrogen 
economy while curbing emissions, 
the hub must reach and eventually 
exceed the DOE targets of $1/
kg of hydrogen and 2 kg CO2/ kg 
of hydrogen.2 Efforts to level the 
playing field for all production 
pathways should proceed with 
these ultimate goals in mind. Texas 

should scale and improve existing 
clean hydrogen technologies, while 
setting rigorous standards for carbon 
emissions, lowering the costs of new 
technologies, and developing the 
requisite infrastructure.

 y Ensure equitable and just growth: 
Texas should emphasize energy and 
environmental justice, Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion (DEI), and 
innovation efforts by academic, 
industry, and government 
participants in the ecosystem. In line 
with the Justice40 Initiative, the clean 
hydrogen hub should seek to reduce 
the energy burden on disadvantaged 
communities; encourage 
development of the domestic supply 
chain; and set high labor standards 
for hydrogen jobs. Texas should 
ensure an early and continuing 
participatory process through which 
impacted communities are prioritized 
for clean hydrogen development. 
The state should also ensure 
meaningful, robust engagement 
with disadvantaged communities 
as it develops the clean hydrogen 
economy. 

 y Innovate at scale: Texas should 
build an end-to-end innovation 
ecosystem that extends from 
basic R&D to commercialization. 
The state should also tap top-
tier talent conducting hydrogen 
research at local universities and

organizations to build collaborative 
teams across institutional lines and 
seek opportunities to work with 
researchers beyond state lines. 

2. Elements of the vision 
Adhering to the guiding principles, this 
report offers a multiphase vision for 
Texas to build and expand a hydrogen 
hub over the next 30 years. The vision 
and strategic priorities reflect bold 
aspirations for the state – stretch 
goals that could propel Texas toward 
global leadership in hydrogen across 
demand, supply, and enablers (including 
infrastructure, innovation, talent, 
environmental justice, and DEI)  
by 2050. 

The right incentives could make Texas 
a global leader in hydrogen production, 
hydrogen use, innovation, and talent 
development by 2050. The state’s 
total clean hydrogen production 
could reach 21 MT, including 11 MT 
to meet local demand and 10 MT to 
export. The hydrogen economy could 
create ~180,000 jobs, including direct, 
indirect, and induced jobs (see section 
6.4 for details), and could add an 
estimated $100 billion to Texas’ GDP, 
which is equivalent to 6% of Texas’ 2019 
GDP. The 21 MT of hydrogen production 
could cut global CO2 emissions by  
220 MT. 

3. Strategic roadmap 
This section translates that bold vision 
into a high-level roadmap showing how 
Texas could progress toward achieving 
that vision.

Phase 1 (2022-25): Jump-start the 
ecosystem 

Texas could jumpstart local demand for 
clean hydrogen by substituting clean 
hydrogen for conventional hydrogen 
in industrial applications and replacing 
diesel trucks with FCEVs. Supply could 
be developed by retrofitting current 

hydrogen producing facilities with 
CCS equipment. Texas can also start 
building infrastructure for transport, 
storage, and export in the region while 
also developing regulatory frameworks 
and policy incentives. 

By 2035, Texas could see local 
production of ~5 MT (~2 times 2021) 
with additional production of ~3 MT for 
export. The state should seek to hit 
production cost targets of $1 or less 
per kilogram for all forms of hydrogen.

These efforts could lead to Texas 
producing a total of ~4 MT of hydrogen 
(~30% higher than 2021). Texas should 
pursue average production cost 
targets of $2/kg for natural-gas-based 
hydrogen and $3/kg for electrolysis-
based hydrogen by 2025.

Phase 2 (2025-2030): Scale existing use 
cases and explore new use cases 

After establishing the hub ecosystem, 
Texas could increase demand by scaling 
existing use cases while exploring 
new ones. To increase supply, Texas 
could continue to lower production 
costs, scale capacity, and explore 
emerging technologies. Expanding 
infrastructure and conducting export 
pilots will further enable Texas as a 
hydrogen hub.

By 2030, Texas could see local 
production of ~5MT (~70% higher 
than 2021) and should seek average 
production cost targets of at least 
$1.50/kg for natural-gas-based 
hydrogen and $2/kg for electrolysis-
based hydrogen. 

Phase 3 (2030-2035): Lead the nation 
on hydrogen 

Texas should increase demand for 
electrolysis-based hydrogen as it 
becomes more competitive to help 
lead the U.S. in hydrogen. With demand 
drivers fostering innovation on the 
supply side, Texas can continue to 
lower supply costs. Texas could also 
integrate infrastructure with other 
national hubs and increase export 
capacity.

Phase 4 (2035-2050): Assume global 
hydrogen leadership 

Texas could expand demand by 
pursuing 100% clean hydrogen 
penetration across use cases, i.e., 
eliminate hydrogen produced without 
CCS. To strengthen supply, Texas 
could continue efforts launched in 
Phases 2 and 3 to decrease costs and 
emissions and increase capacity. Texas 
could finalize its export infrastructure 
for hydrogen and hydrogen-based 
fuels, thereby building on its national 
leadership to become a global leader.

By 2050, Texas could see local 
production of 11 MT, with additional 
surplus production of 10 MT for export. 
Texas should pursue further cost 
reduction, including on a delivered cost 
basis. 

The following roadmaps for building 
demand and supply adhere to the 
multiphase timeline outlined above.

A. Demand roadmap

Industrial applications 

Refining and petrochemicals: 
Hydrogen use in refining and 
petrochemicals offers early 
opportunities to leverage clean 
hydrogen for decarbonization, given 
the current scale and maturity of use 
cases.

New industrial applications: Texas 
could develop new industrial uses of 
hydrogen at scale. In the near term, 
Texas could pilot clean hydrogen use 
in existing natural gas applications and 
eventually substitute clean hydrogen 
for natural gas in hot briquetted iron 
(HBI) plants, such as the Corpus Christi

Mobility

Ground transportation: With fuel-cell 
vehicles maturing steadily, ground 
transportation demand hinges on 
developing a fueling network. In the 
near term, Texas could seek to build 
the largest local hydrogen ground 
transportation network by creating 
open access networks for HDTs, linking 
private hydrogen networks, and piloting 
hydrogen vehicles for public transit and 
anchored fleets with local operations. 
While compressed hydrogen will likely 
be the preferred fuel for heavy-duty 
trucks in the near term, Texas could 
investigate how LH2 could help increase 
mileage and reduce fueling times. 

This local Houston network could 
eventually expand to the Texas Triangle, 
extending into hydrogen corridors on 
I-10, I-45, and I-35 and potentially into 
California on I-10. In the long run, Texas 

could expand the interstate network 
to enable long-distance trucking use 
cases while also expanding the network 
of fueling stations. 

Marine transportation and aviation: 
Port vessels and airport support 
vehicles offer some early opportunities 
to increase demand before hydrogen 
propulsion and hydrogen-fuel-
supported airplanes and vessels 
become available. Texas could pilot 
hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered tow 
tractors as airport tugs, hydrogen-
powered tugboats, and ammonia- and 
methanol-fueled ships at the port. 

In the long run, Texas could expand the 
pilot of ammonia- and methanol-fueled 
ships. Because synthetic fuels promise 
to become more important in the 
marine and aviation energy mix after 
2030, Texas should also conduct pilots 
in synfuel production. 

Power and energy storage

In the near term, Texas could conduct 
trials of 30-50% gas turbine blending, 
distributed fuel-cell-power generation, 
and hydrogen to combine heat 
and power. Texas could test power 
generators that use higher-percentage 
hydrogen blends, including piloting 
100% hydrogen- or ammonia-capable 
projects as some products might be 
available by 2025.4 Texas could also 
build integrated power and hydrogen 
storage projects for large-scale 
turbines (≥200 MW).

In the long run, Texas should implement 
100% hydrogen- or ammonia-capable 
gas turbines. Texas could also build 
combined hydrogen generation 
and power plants at scale for clean 
hydrogen production, co-located with 
zero-emission power generation, while 
also conducting extensive pilots of 
hydrogen for long-duration, seasonal, 
grid-scale energy storage.

Export 

Hydrogen export requires scaling 
local supply, building the requisite 
infrastructure, and forming long-term 
export partnerships. In the near term, 
Texas could begin building ammonia 
infrastructure (e.g., ammonification) 
near major ports such as Houston 
and Corpus Christi to support marine 
export. Texas could pilot natural-gas-
based hydrogen or ammonia exports to 
Japan and Europe because the absence 
of cracking or purification makes 
demand for ammonia as an end use case 
more cost-effective.

Building out the necessary 
infrastructure for ammonia exports 
will require further study. But ~60% of

current domestic ammonia production 
capacity sits in Louisiana, Texas, and 
Oklahoma due to their access to natural 
gas, which is used in conventional 
ammonia production.5 This accessible 
expertise could help Texas accelerate 
the development of ammonia export 
infrastructure. 

Texas could also consider building 
LH2 infrastructure around the Port 
of Houston. A liquefaction plant here 
could serve as a distribution center for 
LH2 to be trucked throughout the state 
(and surrounding states) for smaller 
applications such as refueling stations 
and forklift operations. This approach 
could help meet local hydrogen 
demands before a wider buildout 
of hydrogen pipelines. An at-scale 
liquefaction plant could eventually be 
used for LH2 exports for short distances 
through bulk LH2 carriers. 

Export activity is already happening in 
Gulf Coast ports, which are orienting 
themselves for potential exports of 
hydrogen and derivative products. 
For example, the Port of Corpus 
Christi signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) with the Port of 
Rotterdam in early 2021 that outlines 
several shared objectives, including 
the development of innovative 
technologies such as hydrogen. Such 
arrangements could pave the way to 
create green corridors designed to 
connect clean hydrogen supply in the 
Gulf Coast with demand abroad for 
hydrogen products.6               

B.  Supply roadmap

priorities for managing supply. 
Rooted in the guiding principles of 
reducing emissions and costs, the 
roadmap emphasizes scaling existing 
technologies and exploring emerging 
technologies. 

Natural-gas-based capacity and 
industrial scale

In the near term, there may be 
opportunities to retrofit existing 
SMRs with CCS. This effort could cut 
emissions in certain plants where a 
retrofit is feasible.7 

Texas could also expand natural-gas-
based hydrogen capacity (e.g., through 
SMR and ATR pathways) beyond the 
current asset base. Furthermore, Texas 
could explore industrial-scale, clean 
hydrogen generation (e.g., through 
sorbent-enhanced reformers with 
CCS).

In the long term, Texas could explore 
opportunities to replace SMRs with 
new plant designs better suited to 
higher CO2 capture rates and continue 

to increase production and decrease 
carbon intensity, especially on a 
lifecycle basis. 

Emerging pathways

Emerging pathways offer opportunities 
to reduce emissions and costs. 
Texas can be a leader in developing 
and piloting new technologies. As 
discussed in section 6.3, Texas is 
home to a vibrant venture capital 
and start-up community, numerous 
top-tier universities, incubators 
such as Greentown Labs, and major 
corporations willing to dedicate 
resources to funding innovation. 

In the near term, for example, pilots 
could be developed using waste-to-
hydrogen, renewable-natural-gas-
to-hydrogen, and other emerging 
technologies such as synthetic 
biology (e.g., Houston-based startup 
Cemvita Factory) and photocatalysts 
(e.g., Houston-based startup Syzygy 
Plasmonics).The Carbon Hub at Rice 
University in Houston has been

developing pyrolysis technologies 
that transform natural gas into 
carbon nanotubes (i.e., solid carbon) 
and hydrogen. This technology has 
a learning curve of 30-40% per year 
(approximately twice as fast as solar 
technology).8 Cambrian Energy 
operates a biomethane extraction plant 
in Dallas that produces the equivalent 
of 60,000 gallons of renewable natural 
gas (RNG) per day; HubZRO is already 
working to use this RNG to produce 
hydrogen. 

Texas could also pilot offshore 
electrolysis (similar to RWE’s demo 
project in the Dutch North Sea9), 
natural-gas-based production that 
uses existing pipelines at sea, or 
smaller-scale electrolysis-based 
hydrogen production powered by 
nuclear and geothermal energy.10

In the long term, Texas could pilot 
methods such as renewable liquid 
reforming (e.g., ethanol) or woody 
biomass gasification. Gasification 
projects using woody biomass as a 
feedstock could generate up to  
70 tons of hydrogen per day and are 
under development in the Houston 
area. These projects are currently 
focused on higher-value liquid fuels 
as the end product, but hydrogen is 
produced during an intermediate step. 
If hydrogen production is incentivized, 
woody biomass gasification, combined 

with CCS, could achieve a negative 
carbon intensity and become an 
important large-volume renewable 
source of hydrogen in the Houston area.

4. Environmental justice 
While Texas’ role as the energy capital 
of the world has benefited the larger 
Gulf Coast region economically, 
disadvantaged communities have 
disproportionately shouldered the 
costs of industrial activities. Some 
disadvantaged communities,11 
composed predominantly of minorities, 
have suffered from the emissions of 
nearby industrial facilities and heavy-
duty diesel trucks. 

Communities along the Houston Ship 
Channel have experienced a host of 
health issues due to their proximity to 
industrial facilities. For example, the 
Harrisburg/Manchester neighborhood 
houses at least 30 industrial emitters of 
air contaminants, and 97% of residents 
are people of color. Bordering the 
shipping canal, Galena Park has over 
50 industrial facilities across the wider 
community; 20% of residents live below 
the poverty line.12 Communities around 
the Port of Houston have also been 
exposed to substantial NOx pollution 
from the heavy-duty trucks servicing 
the Port. 

By becoming a hydrogen hub, Texas 
could address the dual challenges 

of revitalizing its energy economy 
and mitigating the impact on the 
communities that have suffered. Texas 
could take a phased approach to this 
effort (similar to the approach used 
in the supply and demand roadmaps). 
An environmentally just approach to 
creating a clean hydrogen economy 
could see increased life expectancy in 
disadvantaged communities and more 
economic opportunities for those 
communities. 

Some organizations have already begun 
to address this issue. HETI aims to 
explore and understand the vision that 
all stakeholders have for Houston’s 
energy transition and for enabling 
access to clean, reliable, resilient, 
and affordable energy as part of that 
transition. Working with a wide range of 
stakeholders, HETI will develop a broad, 
practical agenda for addressing climate 
equity and environmental justice issues 
as part of Houston’s energy transition 
strategy. Working with experienced, 
science-driven, solutions-based 
organizations, such as the Houston 
Advanced Research Center (HARC) and 
stakeholder engagement experts, HETI 
is developing a framework to identify 
and implement energy transition 
strategies and actions that will address 
both CO2 emissions and the equity and 
environmental justice issues that affect 
communities in the Houston region.

The HETI framework for climate equity 
and environmental justice will be 
research-based and includes several 
key elements:
 y Community-based participatory 
research with disadvantaged 
or impacted communities to 
identify and develop solutions with 
communities from the start.
 y Development of a programmatic 
agenda to address the specific 
equity and environmental justice 
issues identified through research, 
including:

 ‒ Climate risk: climate and flood 

adaptation and resilience.

 ‒ Energy burden: access and 

affordability.

 ‒ Environmental hazards: quality of 

air and water.

 ‒ Workforce development: access to 

clean energy jobs. 

 y Identification of key metrics to assess 

progress against the developed 
solutions.

By bringing together a wide range 
of organizations – corporations, 

communities, universities, and 
municipalities – HETI, with support 
from trusted organizations such as 
HARC, will work to bridge the gap 
between corporate climate action and 
environmental justice and develop 
solutions that can both reduce the 
emissions associated with climate 
change and improve the quality of life 
for all Houstonians.

Environmental justice roadmap

In phase 1, Texas could identify 
disadvantaged communities 
experiencing the greatest cumulative 
effects from environmental hazards. 
Subsequently, Texas could actively 
form, strengthen, and invite input from 
advisory panels representing such local 
communities, including initiatives like 
Houston Complete Communities to 
study and address the issues raised. 
This would require setting goals for 
leveraging clean hydrogen to reduce 
the energy burden (including adverse 
health and psychological outcomes) 
and communicating those goals to the 
public. Texas could implement air and 
water monitoring in disadvantaged 
communities (e.g., mobile equipment

1. Use the White House's July 2021 "Interim Implementation Guidance for the Justice40 Initiative," which defines "disadvantaged" as: 1) low income, 
high and/or persistent poverty; 2) high unemployment and underemployment; 3) racial and ethnic residential segregation; 4) linguistic isolation; 
5) high housing cost burden and substandard housing; 6) distressed neighborhoods; 7) high transportation cost burden and/or low transportation 
access; 8) disproportionate environmental stressor burden and high cumulative impacts; 9) limited water and sanitation access and affordability; 
10) disproportionate impacts from climate change; 11) high energy cost burden and low energy access; 12) jobs lost through the energy transition; 
13) limited access to healthcare

or stationary sensors) to establish 
a baseline and monitor progress. 
Texas could also prioritize launching 
transportation networks fueled by 
FCEVs for airport and port support 
applications as well as for school buses 
and public transit, which many residents 
of disadvantaged communities rely on.

In phase 2, Texas should ensure 
that 40% of the benefits from pilot 
investments into the hydrogen 
economy flow to disadvantaged 
communities, with careful planning in 
land-use processes and in keeping with 
the Justice40 Initiative.13 

In the process, Texas should require 
careful examination of the design and 
placement of emerging hydrogen 
production technologies for resiliency 
in inclement weather conditions 
(e.g., extreme temperatures) and 
against routine wear and tear, thereby 
bolstering the preparedness of 
disadvantaged communities against 
future emergencies and disasters. 
Through collaborations with private 
players and educational institutions, 
Texas could also prioritize providing 
education to disadvantaged 
communities, so they are empowered 
with unique skillsets to be more 
competitive in the energy transition 
job market. Setting requirements for 
minority-owned business contracts 
and diversity recruitment will also be 
critical while hydrogen infrastructure is 
being built. 

In phase 3, Texas could continue 
to reduce the level of pollutants in 
disadvantaged communities to or 
below statewide averages. In phase 4, 
Texas could continue measuring and 
reducing pollution in disadvantaged 
communities to levels considered 
healthy by the EPA. 

13   Suggestions in this report represent only sample interpretations of Justice40. Actual implementation should follow updated guidelines.

Sample projects

The hydrogen ecosystem in Texas 
is likely to grow in different ways. 
This growth will probably manifest in 
projects along the hydrogen value chain 
that fall into three broad categories: 
demand, infrastructure, and supply. 
This chapter seeks to briefly outline 
sample potential projects in Texas that 
could develop within the 2030 time 
frame, and their collective implication 
on the formation of a hydrogen hub. 

Demand-based projects
1.  Large-scale new natural gas-based 

hydrogen production serving 
refining and petrochemicals 
operations in industrial centers 
such as Houston: Refining and 
petrochemicals production could 
create significant demand signals 
that new natural gas-based 
hydrogen facilities with CCS could 
meet. These facilities could reduce 
emissions substantially in the near 
term and alleviate air pollution in 
communities near refining and 
petrochemical plants.

2.  Large-scale electrolysis using 
wind, solar, battery storage, 
and pipelines serving demand 
centers in East Texas: Large-
scale electrolysis using wind and 
solar in places such as West Texas 
could take advantage of battery 
storage to reduce production 
costs and compensate for the 

intermittency of renewable energy. 
The electrolysis involved would likely 
be low-temperature electrolysis 
such as PEM or alkaline. This project 
could require building pipeline 
infrastructure to transport hydrogen 
from the point of production to the 
point of demand, although trucks 
could also be used to transport LH2 
to demand centers.1

and Corpus Christi: Texas enjoys 
substantial advantages in producing 
clean hydrogen and hydrogen-based 
fuels (e.g., ammonia and methanol), 
as discussed in section 2.4. This 
project would capitalize on Texas’ 
attractive production economics 
and prepare the infrastructure 
needed to export clean hydrogen 
and hydrogen-based fuels. 

3.  High-temperature electrolysis 

co-located with demand centers 
in East Texas: This project would 
co-locate electrolysis-based 
hydrogen production with demand 
and would use high-temperature 
electrolysis (e.g., SOEC). This 
project would demonstrate the 
cost-effectiveness of hydrogen 
production without incurring 
transport costs.

4.  Hydrogen blending in local 

natural gas grids serving local 
demand centers in cities around 
Texas: Hydrogen blending would 
demonstrate the potential of 
using natural gas infrastructure for 
hydrogen to accelerate adoption and 
reduce capital expenditures. This 
project would also demonstrate the 
potential of decarbonizing energy-
intensive buildings.

5.  Export of clean hydrogen or 

hydrogen-based fuels to East Asia 
from major ports such as Houston 

6.  Clean hydrogen for hot briquetted 
iron (HBI) production in facilities 
such as those in Corpus Christi: 
Texas has the largest, single-
module HBI plant and therefore an 
opportunity to demonstrate that 
clean hydrogen can replace natural 
gas as a reducing agent and make 
emissions-free HBI to decarbonize 
steel production. 

Infrastructure-based 
projects
7.  Port applications in drayage, 

material handling, distributed 
power generation, and marine in 
places such as the Port of Houston: 
Switching from diesel-powered 
drayage trucks to hydrogen-
powered trucks would immediately 
improve the air quality around 
ports, to the benefit of surrounding 
communities. A fueling station at a 
port could get supply from nearby 
waste-to-hydrogen production or 
a connection to a local hydrogen 

1  According to one study by the University of Texas, transporting hydrogen by pipeline from West Texas would involve one-third of the cost of 

transmitting West Texas electricity to the point of use in Houston and producing hydrogen there.

would demonstrate the viability of 
an interconnected hydrogen hub 
in Texas. Port support vessels and 
vehicles for material handling could 
also transition to hydrogen, further 
reducing water and air pollution.

nuclear power facilities. Using 
energy from these facilities 
to produce hydrogen would 
demonstrate the diversity of 
electricity sources in Texas and the 
feasibility of co-locating production 
next to a nuclear power plant.

12. Waste-to-hydrogen pilot for 
hydrogen production in major 
cities such as Houston, Dallas,  
and San Antonio: Developing 
hydrogen from waste would 
diversify Texas’ production 
pathways, while delivering a  
carbon-negative fuel. Hydrogen 
developed from waste produces 
less hydrogen, making it better 
suited to use cases such as mobility 
or distributed fuel cells.

8.  Local fueling network built for 
HDTs and public transit buses 
around the Texas Triangle and for 
vehicles at airports such as George 
Bush Intercontinental Airport: 
Building a local hydrogen fueling 
network for heavy-duty trucks 
and public transit buses would 
immediately reduce diesel pollution, 
i.e., PM and NOx. This open network 
would also lay the foundation for 
extending the fueling infrastructure 
for FCEV adoption at scale after 
2030 to the entire state of Texas.

9.  Seasonal energy storage using 

geological hydrogen storage along 
the east and south coasts of Texas: 
This project would demonstrate 
the feasibility of seasonal energy 
storage, while showcasing Texas’ 
geological advantage. Seasonal 
energy storage would especially 
matter as more of the Texas grid 
becomes renewable and susceptible 
to intermittency.

10.  Natural gas and hydrogen dual fuel 
power plant / pure ammonia or 
hydrogen power plant such as the 
one in development near Bridge 
City, Texas: A dual fuel power plant 
using natural gas and hydrogen 
– or gas turbines running on pure 
ammonia or pure hydrogen – would 
demonstrate the feasibility of Texas 
transitioning away from natural gas 
for power and heat. 

Supply-based projects

production using Texas’ nuclear 
power plants: Texas houses two

Brownsville

As discussed below, Texas and the entire 
Gulf Coast region are uniquely situated 
to create a substantial hydrogen 
ecosystem because the assets extend 
across both Texas and Louisiana.

B.  Corpus Christi and South Texas 
could house clean hydrogen 
production, serving applications 
such as iron and steel and export of 
hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels.

D.   Beaumont and East Texas could 

house clean hydrogen production by 
expanding upon existing hydrogen 
infrastructure, serving applications 
such as power generation.

A.  The Greater Houston Area could 
house clean hydrogen production 
from various pathways, serving 
applications in industrial feedstocks 
(refining, ammonia, and methanol, 
among others), utility grid natural gas 
blending, port applications, and export 
of hydrogen and hydrogen-based 
fuels. Greater Houston could also host 
onshore and offshore CO2 storage 
supporting hydrogen production.

C.  Dallas and the Texas Triangle could 
house a regional hydrogen fueling 
network for ground transportation 
supplied by sources such as waste-
to-hydrogen production. This 
network could eventually connect 
with nearby states, such as Louisiana. 

E. 

 West Texas could house renewable 
and natural gas supplies,  
onshore CO2 storage, and clean 
hydrogen production co-located 
with renewables.

Note:      

1. Policy 
The scaling up of hydrogen is likely 
to face significant challenges in 
developing R&D support, direct 
financial incentives for clean 
hydrogen production and related 

sectors such as renewables and CCS, 
demand enablement, and regulatory 
frameworks. Overcoming these 
challenges will likely require policy 
interventions at the federal and state 
levels. This report has adopted an 
accelerated timeline, which could be 
disrupted by several factors. 

First and foremost, policymakers could 
fail to create the needed regulatory 
architecture to help encourage 
development of a hydrogen hub. 
Companies are not likely to risk investing 
in new infrastructure or assets without 
an established regulatory framework 
(e.g., lack of detailed guidance on 
permitting and siting). This possibility 
is especially real for Texas, as the state 
legislature meets every other year and 
could conceivably be busy with other 
pressing legislation during the next 
session, thereby delaying the hydrogen 
hub’s development by two more years. 

Another potential impediment would 
be the inability to coordinate the supply 
chain around the development of new 
technologies or capacity related to 
hydrogen production and export, (e.g., 
required ammonia carrying vessel 
capacity for exports.) 

Finally, a hub ecosystem will hinge 
upon industrial trunk line development 
with open access. This will require 
coordinated action between key 

players, supported by fit-for-purpose 
incentives which spur investments in 
shared infrastructure. Any failure on 
this front could significantly limit scaling 
hydrogen production in the region. 

This section offers examples of 
promising policy approaches, both 
existing and potential. The policies 
discussed are not exhaustive; they 
present a sample view. Efforts to refine, 
prioritize, and advocate for appropriate 
policies would require further study. 

1.1. Federal interventions

National commitments and targets

 The U.S. Department of Energy has 
set a goal of $1/kg of hydrogen and 
an emissions goal of 2 kg of CO2 / kg 
of hydrogen as part of the Hydrogen 
Earthshot effort.1

Many countries have started setting goals 
for reaching specified levels of hydrogen 
consumption. For example, Japan has 
set the targets of consuming 3 MTPA and 
producing 420 KT by 2030. Canada has 
set the goal of using 4 MTPA by 2030.2

The Department of Energy has 
announced multiple initiatives to fund 
hydrogen R&D and pilots, including $8 
billion for regional clean hydrogen hubs 
and $500 million for clean hydrogen 
manufacturing and recycling initiatives.3

Direct federal incentives for hydrogen 
production and storage

Several pending bills include policies  
to encourage hydrogen production  
and storage. 
 y Build Back Better Act (H.R. 5376), 

introduced into Congress in 
September 2021, would provide 
production tax credits of up to $3/
kg of hydrogen for ten years after the 
hydrogen production facility goes 
into service. To qualify for the full tax 
credit, the produced hydrogen would 
have to reduce lifecycle greenhouse 
gas emissions by at least 95%, 
compared with hydrogen produced 
via SMR today. The tax credit would 
decrease on a sliding scale; the lowest 
possible credit would be $0.60/kg of 
hydrogen produced.4

 ‒ Section 136403 would create a 

30% credit for qualified commercial 
electric vehicles and includes fuel 
cell electric powertrains.5 

 ‒ Section 136405 would create an 

alternative fuel refueling property 
credit that would raise the current 
cap on the investment tax credit 
from $30,000 to $100,000, which 
would help support the building of 
hydrogen fueling stations.6
 y Clean H2 Production Act of 2021 (S. 
1807), introduced into Congress in 
May 2021, would grant a tax credit 
of up to $3/kg for producing clean 
hydrogen. The bill defines clean as 
hydrogen that reduces lifecycle 
greenhouse gas emissions at least 
50%, compared with hydrogen 
produced today using SMR without 
CCS. The bill would also provide 
tax incentives for investing in clean 
hydrogen facilities.7

 y Clean Hydrogen Production and 

Investment Tax Credit Act of 2021 
(H.R.5192), introduced into Congress 
in September 2021, would grant a tax 
credit for producing qualified clean 
hydrogen. The bill defines qualified 
clean hydrogen as any hydrogen 

production process that reduces 
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions 
at least 40%, compared with existing 
hydrogen production pathways,  
e.g., SMR.  
The tax credit would depend on 
the exact percentage of emissions 
reduction, with a maximum credit of $3/
kg of hydrogen for the ten years after 
the hydrogen production facility goes 
into service.8 This tax credit structure 
is very similar to the House-passed 
version of the Build Back Better Act.
 y Growing Renewable Energy and 

Efficiency Now Act of 2021 (H.R. 848), 
introduced into Congress in February 
2021, would expand a 30% investment 
tax credit (ITC) to “energy storage 
technology,” including equipment 
for hydrogen storage, that begins 
construction in 2022 through 2026.9

Several other approaches warrant 
consideration.
 y Contract for Difference (CfD)

the U.K. Department for Business,

Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). 
Responsible for energy policy in the 
U.K., BEIS is working with industry 
to identify the most efficient 
approach to supporting hydrogen 
production and storage and CO2 
capture. The group is considering 
CfD to guarantee selling low-carbon 
hydrogen at prices comparable to 
incumbents (e.g., petrol and diesel) 
for the duration of the contract, 
potentially 15 years.10

 y Hydrogen investment tax credit 
against the cost of hydrogen 
production equipment would further 
encourage the production of hydrogen 
and domestic manufacturing. 

Direct federal incentives for renewable 
electricity production can be found in 
current and potential policies.
 y The Production Tax Credit (PTC) 
applies to renewable electricity 
generation, but only to renewable 
energy construction started before 
December 31, 2021. Qualifying 
construction can receive 60% of the 
full credit amount, or about $15/MWh.11 
An extension of the PTC would further 
reduce the cost of electricity in 
electrolysis-based hydrogen, a major 
source of cost. A PTC valued at the 
full $15/MWh could have substantial 
impact on the levelized cost of 
hydrogen. The cost of hydrogen in 
2025 and 2030 would drop 23% and 

29%, respectively, if the PTC continued 
through the end of the decade.
 y The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) 

for solar is set to decrease from 26% 
today to 10% for construction after 
December 31, 2023. Extending the 
ITC at 26% would further reduce the 
cost of solar energy and therefore 
electrolysis-based hydrogen 
produced with renewable energy 
generated by photovoltaic systems.12

Federal CCS incentives stimulate 
investment in CCS value chains.
 y The federally administered tax credit 
per ton of captured CO2 known as 
45Q is set to expire in January 2026, 
too soon for some projects in the 
planning phase to qualify. Supporting 
a 45Q extension might be a priority for 
Texas. In addition, 45Q does not always 
provide adequate commercial certainty 
for large-scale projects; alternatives 
and extensions warrant exploration.

 y Coordinated Action to Capture 

Harmful Emissions Act (H.R.3538), 
introduced into Congress in May 2021, 
could address the above issues. The 
bill would increase the 45Q tax credit 
to $85/ton of CO2 sequestered.13

The U.K. is considering a regulated 
long-term returns model for hydrogen 
and CO2 pipelines, funded through 
the existing Regulated Asset Base 
(RAB) model. Other models under 

consideration include a public and 
privately owned entity, cost plus open 
book, waste sector type contractor, 
and hybrid models.14

Federal policies to build hydrogen 
demand exist today, but more are 
needed to encourage different end 
users to adopt hydrogen. Current 
policies include:
 y The Zero Emissions Airport Vehicle 
and Infrastructure Pilot Program 
reimburses airports up to 50% of the 
cost of purchasing zero-emissions 
vehicles or modifying existing 
vehicles to handle hydrogen.15

 y The Port Infrastructure 

Development Program provides 
funding through 2026 for projects 
that reduce or eliminate port-related 
emissions, including hydrogen fueling 
infrastructure. The Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 
appropriated $450 million to this 
program for fiscal year 2022.16

The Department of Transportation 
is planning a grant program to direct 
funding toward alternative fuel 
infrastructure, including hydrogen 
fueling infrastructure in public areas, 
parks, roads, and schools. The program 
might offset up to 80% of project costs 
and would focus especially on low- and 
moderate-income neighborhoods.17

first 200,000 models of a BEV. A grant 
program could encourage private 
companies to switch to hydrogen fuel 
cell commercial trucks. 

y Renewable portfolio standards: 
Texas could establish a renewable 
portfolio standard for hydrogen, 
such as directing utilities to blend a 
certain percentage of hydrogen into 
natural gas.

y Rate base recovery: Texas could 
allow utilities to recover the cost 
of hydrogen blending. Minnesota’s 
Natural Gas Innovation Act shows 
this practice in action. The law lets 
utility companies petition state 
regulators to recover the costs of 
innovative projects to decarbonize 
operations, i.e., hydrogen blending.19

y Distributed energy incentives: 

California’s Self-Generation Incentive
Program gives rebates to customers 
who have installed qualifying 
distributed energy systems such as 
fuel cells. Texas could create such a 
program to encourage businesses to 
use fuel cells. 

Potential regulatory frameworks 
warrant consideration as Texas plans 
efforts to build a hydrogen hub. 
y CCS: Considerations in CCS policy 

and regulations include R&D support, 
onshore pore space access, utilization
for geological storage of CO2, and 
long-term ownership and liabilities.

y Hydrogen safety and blending 

codes: Building on current natural 
gas regulatory frameworks could 
simplify and accelerate efforts 
to create a hydrogen regulatory 
framework. Hydrogen is currently 
regulated as a “flammable gas” under 
the Department of Transportation’s 
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
Safety Administration (PHMSA), which 
also regulates existing hydrogen 
infrastructure.18 The Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission regulates the 
interstate transmission of natural gas. 

1.2. State policies

State commitments and targets

 Texas could set goals for reaching 
certain levels of hydrogen adoption by 
application, such as FCEV adoption in 
trucking. These commitments would 
help to align the efforts of private and 
public businesses in the hydrogen 
economy and establish Texas as a global 
leader in hydrogen.

Texas could provide funding for 
development of a hydrogen hub 
in the state and partnerships with 
neighboring states. 

Direct incentives could encourage action 
on several dimensions of hub building.
y State tax incentives could include 
Chapter 313 renewal (the Texas 

Economic Development Act), Chapter 
311 (Tax Increment Reinvestment 
Zones), and a tax freeze or ten-year 
exemption for hydrogen production 
and consumption. 

y Development of a low-carbon fuel 
standard could encourage the 
production of hydrogen fuel by 
offering a tax credit for each kilogram 
of hydrogen produced. 

y Renewable electricity policies could 

include additional funding for
transmission infrastructure, such as 
Competitive Renewable Energy 
Zones II (CREZ II). 

y State funding for CCS and other 

elements of the value chain required to 
produce hydrogen, including 
production, pipeline distribution, 
energy storage, carbon capture and 
sequestration, and fueling 
infrastructure. This funding could also 
support a quality jobs program for 
hydrogen infrastructure development.

State policies are needed to encourage 
adoption of hydrogen by different end 
users. Potential policies include:
y Hydrogen-specific revisions of TERP 
guidelines: The Texas Emissions 
Reduction Plan (TERP) offers 
incentives to businesses to reduce 
vehicle emissions. Texas could revise 
the TERP to include incentives for 
businesses to switch to hydrogen for 
vehicles or equipment. 

y Tax credits, rebates, and/or grants 
for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles: Texas
could offer tax credits or deferments 
for the purchase of these vehicles, 
structured like the $7,500 federal 
tax credit currently available for the

Potential regulatory frameworks that 
Texas could consider while planning to 
build a hydrogen hub.
y Expanding underground storage 
warrants revisiting. In March 2022, 
the Texas House of Representatives 
interim committee for the 
Committee on Energy Resources 
mentioned an initiative to explore 
options for expanding the state’s 
underground natural gas storage 
capacity.  The committee could 
consider including hydrogen storage
to this initiative.20

y CCS: The EPA oversees Underground
Injection Control (UIC) program 
requirements, and states can apply 
for primacy to implement UIC 
programs. Texas does not yet have 
primacy for UIC Class VI wells for 
permanent CO2 storage. As of June 
2021, the Railroad Commission (RRC) 
has sole jurisdictional regulatory 
authority over Class VI wells. If the 
RRC were to seek primacy from 
the EPA, this move could help to 
streamline the permitting process, 
address some uncertainties in 
permitting, and lay the foundation for 
future CCS development in Texas.21

2. Infrastructure
This section focuses on the 
infrastructure needed to help develop a 
hydrogen hub.

Hydrogen storage 

Capacity needed

The U.S. has a natural-gas-storage-to-
consumption ratio of ~13%, while the 
global ratio stands at ~11%. This means 
that the U.S. and the world have ~50 and 
~40 days of gas storage, respectively.22

This ratio might need to be higher 
because hydrogen has no natural storage 
areas. Hydrogen storage demand might 
be greater than natural gas demand 
because grid-scale energy storage might 
require hydrogen to compensate for 
the intermittency of renewable energy. 
Texas might need 1-2 MT of storage for 
hydrogen in 2035 and 2-3 MT in 2050, 
based on estimated production levels of 
8 MT and 21 MT, respectively.

Approaches to acceleration

Since the salt caverns near Houston 
get heavy use, Texas should investigate 
the requirements for converting other 
existing salt caverns to hydrogen 
storage. Research into bedded salt 
compatibility with hydrogen storage 
might be helpful in West Texas for 
co-location with future electrolysis-
based hydrogen production.

Other technical challenges to salt 
cavern storage include material 
compatibility, testing requirements, 
and microbial activities.23 Additional 
research will be required to overcome 
these technical challenges. 

2.2. Hydrogen transport

Capacity needed

The 2020 European Hydrogen 
Backbone study proposed a hydrogen 
transport infrastructure across ten 
European countries based mostly 
on existing energy infrastructure. 
The analysis estimated being able 
to develop ~4,200 miles (6,800 km) 
of hydrogen pipeline by 2030, with 
~14,200 miles (22,900 km) in place by 
2040. This analysis assumed that 75% 
of the backbone would be retrofitted 
natural gas pipelines and the remaining 
25% new hydrogen pipelines.24

The ten European countries have 
about 150,000 km of natural gas 
transmission lines. Assuming that the 
proposed hydrogen pipeline structure 
is proportional to the existing natural 
gas infrastructure suggests that Texas 
would need a hydrogen transportation 
network of ~1,500 miles in 2030 and 
~5,200 miles in 2040, given its existing 
network of ~35,000 miles of natural gas 
transmission pipelines.25

Approaches to acceleration and 
development considerations

The analysis identified three 
approaches for Texas’ consideration.
y Plan regional or superregional 
transport and storage system: 
Holistic planning for transport and 
storage infrastructure in a region can 
enable more rapid development and 
collaboration.

For example, the European Hydrogen 
Backbone Initiative involved 23 
gas infrastructure companies in 
designing a hydrogen network to 
connect all parts of Europe and allow 
imports by 2040. 

The Port of Rotterdam has announced 
its intention to build a 24-inch 
hydrogen pipeline as part of its project 
HyTransPort.RTM. The project is 
open access – any company wishing 
to purchase or supply hydrogen can 
connect to the pipeline. Its construction 
will facilitate a hydrogen market in and 
around Rotterdam, while equipping the 
port to connect to a larger European 
hydrogen network in the future.26 

Texas has ongoing efforts to support 
holistic infrastructure planning. For 
example, the H2@Scale project at 
the University of Texas at Austin is 
investigating pathways for deploying 
clean hydrogen in the Texas energy 
economy. The project team is 
building a spatially resolved, optimal 
infrastructure development tool that 
can locate the lowest-cost, optimal 
deployment of hydrogen infrastructure 
to meet future hydrogen demands. 
The model uses hydrogen demand 
and willingness to pay and determines 
the optimal amount of production and 
distribution infrastructure to meet that 
demand, if it can also meet the price. 
Results from this modeling effort will 

feed into the team’s strategic plan and 
framework for clean hydrogen hub 
activities in Texas.27

 y Cluster physical assets: Clustering 
physical assets around production 
and demand with transport and 
storage infrastructure could increase 
utilization and decrease costs. For 
example, HyNet in the UK plans to 
build a connected system of low-
carbon hydrogen production (Stanlow 
refinery), CO2 transport and storage 
(offshore depleted gas reservoir 
beneath Liverpool Bay), hydrogen 
pipeline, salt cavern storage, industrial 
use, and natural gas blending 
(Liverpool, Manchester, Warrington, 
Wigan, and North Cheshire).28

 y Repurpose natural gas infrastructure: 
Natural gas utilities could help Texas 
decarbonize by creating a clean fuels 
network that complements the 
renewable energy on the electric grid. 
Clean fuels such as hydrogen and 
biogas, used in thermal generation, 
could help maintain a reliable, resilient 
power system when renewable energy 
production is too low to meet demand. 

Utilities are ideally suited to play 
this role, thanks to their extensive 
experience developing and 
maintaining pipelines, navigating 
regulations, and financing large-scale 
infrastructure projects. 
Switching to clean fuels could be 

cheaper than fully decommissioning 
the natural gas system and using 
electrification to meet all energy 
needs. A clean fuels network in a 
warm region like Texas could involve 
total costs 15-25% lower than full 
electrification.29 This report identified 
three challenges to blending hydrogen 
into pipelines full of natural gas:
 ‒ Technical challenges: Current 

estimates suggest that blending 
in as much as 20% hydrogen would 
not require retrofitting pipelines to 
account for hydrogen’s potential 
to embrittle steel.30 But pinpointing 
the upper limit of the “blend wall” 
needs further research.

 ‒ Impact on end-use applications: 
Household appliances such as 
stoves, wall heaters, and forced-
air furnaces might not be able to 
handle natural gas blended with 
hydrogen. Further research is 
required to understand the impact. 
Southern California Gas Company 
recently announced that it is testing 
the performance of household 
systems and appliances using a 
hydrogen blend at a training facility.  

Utilities must also determine where 
to blend hydrogen into the network 
to ensure that no hydrogen enters 
facilities or industrial plants unable

before allowing utilities to proceed.

miles from San Francisco to Houston. 
A network connecting with Louisiana 
is another possibility, especially if this 
state becomes a hydrogen hub.33

y Ensure climate equity: Texas  could  set 

2.3. Hydrogen fueling network 

Capacity needed

Texas might need ~100 hydrogen 
fueling stations to serve heavy-duty 
hydrogen trucks by 2030, given the 
estimated number of those trucks likely 
to be on the road. The network-building 
effort could start in the Texas Triangle 
and expand over time. 

Capital expenditures to build a 
hydrogen fueling station can range 
from $3 million to $4 million for a station 
with a capacity of 4,000 kg/day.31 Texas 
would have to invest $300 million-$400 
million by 2030 to create a fueling 
network with ~100 stations that could 
meet heavy-duty truck fueling needs.32

Approaches to acceleration and 
development considerations

This report identified three approaches 
for Texas’ consideration.
y Connect interstate networks: 
A Texas network of hydrogen 
fueling stations could connect 
with California via Arizona and 
New Mexico, especially if the latter 
becomes a hydrogen hub.  This could 
create a corridor stretching ~2,000 

tactical and strategic goals 
to ensure that the benefits reach 
disadvantaged communities. 
California’s approach will ensure that 
94% of the state’s population and 97% of 
its disadvantaged communities sit 
within a 15-minute drive of a clean fueling 
station. Municipal buses and vehicles 
using these fueling stations could 
further decarbonize city 
transportation and improve air quality. 
Texas could replicate this pattern 
to ensure that the benefits reach 
disadvantaged communities.

y Build multi-use stations: California’s 
fueling stations will cluster around 
dense urban areas like Los Angeles 
County and San Francisco, with 
enough stations along the way to 
handle long-distance travel. Many 
fueling stations will serve both light-
and heavy-duty vehicles. 

2.4. CO2 transport and storage

Capacity needed

While electrolysis-based technologies 
will continue to scale through 2050, 
natural-gas-based pathways will likely 
represent a significant proportion of 
hydrogen production. As such, Texas 
would need significant carbon storage 

as it transitions into a hydrogen hub. In 
2035, the state could produce ~8 MTPA 
of hydrogen. Assuming that 70-90% of 
this production is natural-gas-based, 
Texas would have to store ~45-55 MT of 
CO2, based on ATR with CCS at a 98% 
capture rate.34

In 2050, when Texas produces an 
estimated 21 MT of hydrogen, the 
storage need would increase to ~50-80 
MT of CO2, assuming that natural-gas-
based hydrogen accounts for 30-50% 
of overall hydrogen production.35 The 
percentage of CO2 captured would 
remain similar in 2035 and 2050, despite 
the smaller share of natural-gas-based 
hydrogen, because of the overall 
growth in hydrogen production.

In the coming years, companies 
that can use this captured carbon to 
manufacture products such as carbon 
fiber might develop. Texas could benefit 
from this type of industry, which would 
consume part of the significant amount 
of CO2 expected to be generated and 
captured in the state.

Approach to acceleration and 
development considerations

Texas would need to build regional CO2 
transport and storage infrastructure. 
Decarbonization efforts at industrial 
centers around the world offer 
blueprints for building carbon-capture 
infrastructure. 

31  Expert interviews.
32  For comparison, California and Japan are planning to build hydrogen fueling stations for both light-duty and heavy-duty applications. California seeks 
to build 200 retail fueling stations by 2025 and 1,000 fueling stations by 2030, or one hydrogen fueling station for every eight gas stations that exist 
today. The state’s plan calls for each station to serve 1,000 HFCVs. Japan is taking a similar approach, with a goal of 1,000 fueling stations by 2030, a 
substantial increase from the 160 operating today.

Six energy companies formed the 
Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP) 
in the UK to develop the infrastructure 
to transport CO2 and store it offshore in 
the North Sea. The coordinated carbon 
capture could provide a model for Texas 
as it works with industrial facilities 
spread across the state.

transportation to hydrogen production 
sites as far away as West Texas. 

The success of all hydrogen production 
pathways will depend on having a well-
developed port to host infrastructure and 
a mature supply chain that can provide 
needed materials, such as cement and 
steel to build new production facilities. 

The NEP infrastructure will serve the 
industrial communities of Teesside 
and Humber, two of the most carbon-
intensive industrial regions in the U.K., 
by capturing up to 10 MTPA of CO2 
and 17 MTPA of CO2 in each region, 
respectively, and transporting the 
carbon via pipelines to storage sites 
at least 85 km offshore.36 The sites 
can store 450 MT of CO2 cumulatively, 
with the possibility of tapping into one 
billion tons of additional storage areas 
nearby.37

2.5. Other infrastructure needs 
Texas could create a digital and financial 
trade center for the new hydrogen 
market, similar to the oil and natural gas 
trading centers that already give Texas 
a competitive advantage. Current 
oil and gas trading centers could 
incorporate hydrogen as a commodity.

Texas would need additional 
infrastructure to become a hydrogen 
hub. For example, electrolysis 
pathways would consume a lot of water 
that would require purification and 

3. Innovation ecosystem
To build a hydrogen hub, Texas would 
need an end-to-end innovation system. 
This report envisions the system having 
four core components. 

3.1. Research consortium
Texas should foster collaboration 
across institutional lines to develop 
solutions for a low-carbon future 
using hydrogen. The hydrogen hub 
could create a research consortium, 
drawing researchers from the state’s 
many universities, corporate divisions, 
and start-ups. Bringing these experts 
together would equip the hub to tackle 
the challenges of hydrogen production 
and lead the world in energy. 

3.2. Venture capital/ 
start-up community
Texas is home to a vibrant venture 
capital and start-up community. 
Houston has especially benefited 
from clean tech funding. In the past 
five years, almost $1 billion in venture 

capital has flowed to ~50 Houston-
based energy start-ups and companies. 
In 2021, new energy investments 
exceeded $630 million more than four 
times the record set in 2019.38

Incubators have helped secure this record 
investment. For example, Greentown 
Labs launched in Houston in April 2021 
and scaled quickly, having accepted over 
60 new start-ups by early 2022. Founded 
in Boston, Greentown Labs expanded 
to Houston given the city’s engineering 
strengths, its leading energy companies, 
and the opportunity to help redeploy 
Houston’s assets to create the energy 
transition capital of the world.39

Houston-based corporate ventures 
have supported this start-up 
ecosystem. For example, BP Ventures 
has invested $500 million in 40 
companies.40 Shell Ventures is making 
minority investments in companies that 
help accelerate the energy transition.41 
Baker Hughes Co. has promised to invest 
$60 million in the FiveT Hydrogen Fund, 
which is dedicated to scalable, clean 
hydrogen infrastructure projects.42

Universities also play an important role in 
a hydrogen hub. Rice University’s Carbon 
Hub is researching new applications 
for clean hydrogen energy, as well as 
the possibility of sustainably producing 
advanced carbon materials from natural 
gas and oil. The University of Houston’s 
Center for Carbon Management in Energy

has focused its R&D efforts on low-carbon 
energy. The University of Texas’ Center 
for Electromechanics is participating in 
the H2@Scale project.

3.3 Test facility
New hydrogen solutions require testing 
before scaling and commercialization. 
But innovative technologies that 
emerge from, say, a university often 
struggle to find industry partners to 
help commercialize the discovery. 
The issue is lack of testing, including 
its associated capital and equipment. 
Many start-ups face similar challenges 
in securing the requisite wet labs and 
testing facilities in their early stages. 

A testing facility can help bridge the 
gap between the lab and the market 
by offering a place to fine-tune new 
technologies for eventual use in 
large-scale applications. A hydrogen 
ecosystem in Texas could connect 
start-ups and incubators with emerging 
technologies, reducing the risk and cost 
of the typical lab-to-market process.

The H2@Scale project in Texas has 
provided testing opportunities and 
would need further scaling. Mitsubishi’s 
Takasago Hydrogen Park in Japan might 
demonstrate a path forward. This 
testing facility can oversee every step 
of a technology’s journey to market, 
including research, design, prototype 
production, and validation testing.43

3.4 Equipment manufacturing
Local manufacturing of hydrogen 
production equipment, including but 
not limited to electrolyzers, would 
help create an end-to-end innovation 
system in Texas. This integrated supply 
chain could also reduce costs, further 
integrate the hydrogen production 
supply chain, and create more local jobs.

4. Equitable workforce 
development
The transition to hydrogen could 
create ~180,000 jobs, including direct, 
indirect, and induced jobs. 

Direct jobs participate directly in the 
hydrogen economy. They include jobs 
in the manufacturing of equipment 
to produce and distribute hydrogen; 
hydrogen production, distribution, and 
infrastructure; and the manufacturing of 
specialized materials and components. 

Indirect jobs support the hydrogen 
economy. They include maintenance, legal 
contracting, and administrative support.

Induced jobs are created by the spending 
that direct and indirect jobs make possible. 
They include jobs in entertainment, health 
care, and restaurants.

Workers in the oil and natural gas 
industry could fill many of these 
jobs. Texas could lose ~150,000 jobs 
from 2020-50 under the Further 
Acceleration scenario (see section 
3.1). However, aggressively pursuing 
opportunities like those associated 
with the hydrogen hub and other energy 
transition technologies could fill this 
gap. In fact, ~180,000 represents the 
upper bound of the number of jobs that 
the hub-building effort could reskill. In 
other words, the hydrogen economy 
could net 30,000 more jobs.

Texas should consider three additional 
sources of hydrogen workers.
 y Community college programs 

would require scaling to meet the 
hydrogen employment demand in 
the state and beyond. The Texas 
Reskilling and Upskilling through 
Education (TRUE) program, passed 
by the state legislature in June 2021, 
could support scaling efforts.44 In

communities, through incentives and 
targeted efforts to employ as many 
people directly from disadvantaged 
communities as possible. Academic 
institutions and employers should 
collaborate on training and recruiting 
students and workers from such 
communities to fill those jobs. 

In the near term, Texas could 
convene industry players and 
educational institutions to identify 
future hydrogen-hiring needs 
and develop programs tailored to 
serve disadvantaged communities. 
Texas could also require hydrogen 
educational and retraining programs 
to have over 40% representation 
from disadvantaged communities, in 
keeping with the spirit of the Justice40 
Initiative, and could implement best 
practices and accountability measures 
for companies to increase hiring from 
such communities. 

In the long term, Texas could consider 
requirements and incentives for 80% of 
companies in the hydrogen value chain 
to hire over 40% of their local workers 
from disadvantaged communities. 
Eventually, this requirement could apply 
to 100% of companies in the hydrogen 
value chain.

the spirit of the Justice40 Initiative, 
this training should ensure that 
disadvantaged communities have 
access to these well-paying jobs with 
good labor standards. 

 y Partnerships between industry 

players and educational institutions 
could also help develop the hydrogen 
workforce. Shell and Prairie View 
A&M University signed a $6 million 
renewable energy research 
partnership that will emphasize 
carbon capture and utilization, while 
creating a new hiring pipeline for 
Shell.45Houston and CenterPoint 
Energy recently announced Resilient 
Now, a collaboration to advance 
economic development in vulnerable 
communities in the greater Houston 
area and provide clean energy job 
training.46

 y Higher education curriculums 

should start planning for tomorrow’s 
jobs today. Texas already has 
efforts underway to train people 
for the hydrogen economy. The 
new University of Houston Energy 
Transition Institute will focus on 
clean energy such as hydrogen while 
benefiting communities affected 
by climate change.47 The University 
of Houston also offers a stand-
alone micro-credential program on 
the hydrogen economy for energy 
professionals.48

Texas should also ensure that 
new hydrogen jobs are accessible 
to residents of disadvantaged

Next steps

7

As efforts to envision a Texas-based 
hydrogen hub mature, further analyses 
will be crucial to understanding its 
implications for the economy and the 
climate. These include quantification 
of carbon reduction benefits from 
proposed projects; more granular cost 
comparisons of different methods 
of hydrogen storage and transport; 
and study of the cost of intermediate 
storage, potential optimization of 
power costs by utilizing both wind and 
solar, and changes in demand sources 
over time. Analyses should also explore 
additional factors such as securing a 
pure water supply; the lifecycle and 
selection of system components; 
supply chain constraints and prices 
for rare-earth metals (particularly 
important for electrolyzers); direct 
demand for hydrogen-fired power 
generation, as opposed to gas blending; 
and cost fluctuations from varying 
grades of hydrogen (from carrier/
storage conversion) determined by 
end-use purity attributes.

The next phase of this effort will 
build on this report’s analysis and call 
for actions, especially to accelerate 
demand creation, that will jumpstart 
building the hydrogen hub from 2022 
through 2030. The effort will focus on 
answering the following questions:  

What are the appropriate hub 
funding requirements and 
mechanisms required for the 
hub to take off?

What sequencing of supply, 
demand, and infrastructure 
build up is necessary to 
expand and scale the hub?

What is the right coalition to 
drive an integrated effort for 
the development of the hub?

What three to five demand 
sectors should the hub target

to achieve unique cost 
competitiveness?

What are the end-to-end 
pilot projects and shared

to life?

What is the economic, social, 
and environmental impact 
from these projects such as

Conclusion

8

Texas and the Houston region are 
strong candidates for developing 
a regional clean hydrogen hub. The 
state’s concentration of energy and 
petrochemical players, geological 
advantages, access to multiple ports, 
highly skilled workforce and extensive 
hydrogen pipeline infrastructure, 
position Texas to become a global 
leader in the new hydrogen economy. 
The hydrogen hub could be pivotal in 
helping Texas build a more resilient, 
diversified economy that is well-
equipped for the future, while 
mitigating the emissions footprint of 
the state’s industrial corridors.

A hydrogen hub could have significant 
economic impact and reduce 
emissions. The hub promises to add 
$100 billion of economic value, create 
~180,000 jobs in the region, and abate 
220 MTPA of CO2 by 2050.

The momentum for the energy 
transition in Texas is stronger than 
ever. Over 150 businesses, academic 
institutions, nonprofits, and individual 
experts have been working together in 
the HETI Hydrogen Working Group, led 
by the Center for Houston’s Future, to 
study the viability of such a hub in Texas.

natural gas prices. 

However, parity would be accelerated to 2040-2045 if natural gas

The analysis in this report used two 
Texas-specific LCOE scenarios for wind 
energy to calculate the cost of electricity 
when producing electrolysis-based 
hydrogen. The low LCOE values were 
based on the following assumptions:

1.  The LCOE uses “the top quartile for 

wind in Texas,” which means the LCOE 

is an average of some of the most 
favorable wind speeds in the state.

2.  Wind turbines have a 15% learning 

rate on capex per global doubling of 
deployment; analysis assumes that 
this rate will hold through 2050

3.  The LCOE aligns with the Further 
Acceleration Scenario, as defined 

in the McKinsey Global Energy 
Perspective, February 2022

For context, the U.S. Department of 
Energy estimates that the average 
LCOE for wind in the United States 
for 2020 was $33/MWh with ERCOT 
enjoying $29/MWh. (Source)

The Annual Technology Baseline from 
the National Renewable Energy Lab 
estimates that the best locations in the 
United States currently enjoy LCOEs of 
$26/MWh and could reach $14/MWh in 
2030. (Source)

The high-LCOE scenario uses a general 
average for the region.

the Partnership has launched a critical 
initiative with an ambitious vision:

Leverage Houston’s energy leadership 
to accelerate global solutions for a low-
carbon future.

The Houston Energy Transition 
Initiative (HETI) is rooted in the city’s 
eagerness for innovation; its appetite 
for high-risk and high-reward business 
investments; and its capacity for 
executing on massive, complex 
projects around the world. It also 
leverages Houston’s deep experience 
and infrastructure in producing, 
moving, financing and marketing 
energy in all its forms. 

This effort represents Houston’s 
collective ambition. But it also reflects 
Houstonians’ sense of responsibility for 
putting their capabilities and resources 
to work on global solutions to the 
climate and energy challenges. HETI 
builds on the best of traditional energy 
skills and systems to pave the way for a 
new 21st century low-carbon world. 

Center for Houston’s Future (CHF), an 
independent affiliate of the Greater 
Houston Partnership, focuses on 
understanding future global trends and 
their impact on the Houston region. 
CHF brings business, government and 
community stakeholders together 
to engage in fact-based strategic 
planning, collaboration, and action 
on issues of great importance to the 
success of our region.

Appendix D. Introduction  
to HETI and CHF

 Houston has a long history of solving 
many of the world’s greatest challenges 
– developing medical breakthroughs, 
leading human spaceflight, and 
powering the world – we are a city 
of problem solvers and innovators 
who tackle big, complicated, and 
consequential problems. 

Houston is being called again to solve a 
global challenge of extreme magnitude: 
how to meet growing global demand 
for energy while simultaneously 
dramatically lowering climate changing 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

The challenge of our time is the Energy 
Transition. Solving it – developing and 
scaling the right technologies, creating 
and servicing markets for the right 
mix of energy sources, investing in the 
right energy priorities – is the challenge 
and opportunity that Houston is 
determined to embrace and lead. 

The Greater Houston Partnership’s 
effort to develop a regional energy 
transition strategy was informed 
by an intensive study to understand 
how the region should best tackle the 
challenge. The Partnership’s objective 
was to create a vision and a blueprint 
for growing the region’s economy, 
equitably creating new jobs, exporting 
low-carbon products and expertise, 
and helping Houston achieve its net-
zero emissions target that is core to the 
City’s Climate Action Plan. 

Drawing on strategic analysis and 
recommendations from McKinsey & 
Company, the work of the Center for 
Houston’s Future, University of Houston 
and more than 60 leaders from across 
business, academia and public sectors,

McKinsey Center for Future 
Mobility brings a forward-thinking 
and integrated perspective– 
covering automotive, cities, freight, 
infrastructure, last-mile delivery, 
utilities, and others– to help industry 
leaders and policymakers lead 
change and navigate an increasingly 
autonomous, connected, electrified, 
and shared future.

McKinsey CO2 Emissions Database 
aggregates global industrial CO2 
emissions from over 21,000 facilities 
across 11 sectors. The emissions data 
supports examination of potential 
CCUS clusters, testing of CO2 pipeline 
networks, and understanding of 
regional abatement costs.

McKinsey CCUS Cost Model takes an 
end-to-end approach to model carbon 
capture, compression, transport, 
and storage. It combines publicly 
available data, in-house expertise, 
and benchmarks from McKinsey’s 
proprietary Energy Insights and 
Westney Capital Analytics data sets.
