About the McKinsey Global Institute

The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact base to 
aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s companies 
and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, and functional 
knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are solely the responsibility 
of MGI directors and partners.

Our research is grouped into five major themes:

— Productivity and prosperity: Creating and harnessing the world’s assets most productively

— Resources of the world: Building, powering, and feeding the world sustainably

— Human potential: Maximizing and achieving the potential of human talent

— Global connections: Exploring how flows of goods, people, and ideas shape economies

— Technologies and markets of the future: Discussing the next big arenas of value 
and competition

We aim for independent and fact-based research. None of our work is commissioned or paid for 
by any business, government, or other institution; we share our results publicly free of charge; 
and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While we engage multiple distinguished 
external advisers to contribute to our work, the analyses presented in our publications are MGI’s 
alone, and any errors are our own.

At a glance

 — During the pandemic (2019–22), the US labor market saw 8.6 million occupational 
shifts, 50 percent more than in the previous three-year period. Most involved people 
leaving food services, in-person sales, and office support for different occupations. 

 — By 2030, activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently worked across 

the US economy could be automated—a trend accelerated by generative AI. However, we 
see generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals 
work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright. Automation’s biggest 
effects are likely to hit other job categories. Office support, customer service, and food 
service employment could continue to decline. 

 — Federal investment to address climate and infrastructure, as well as structural shifts, 
will also alter labor demand. The net-zero transition will shift employment away from 
oil, gas, and automotive manufacturing and into green industries for a modest net gain in 
employment. Infrastructure projects will increase demand in construction, which is already 
short almost 400,000 workers today. We also see increased demand for healthcare workers 
as the population ages, plus gains in transportation services due to e-commerce.

 — An additional 12 million occupational transitions may be needed by 2030. As people 

leave shrinking occupations, the economy could reweight toward higher-wage jobs. Workers 
in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations than those in 
highest-wage positions, and most will need additional skills to do so successfully. Women are 
1.5 times more likely to need to move into new occupations than men. 

 — The United States will need workforce development on a far larger scale as well as 

more expansive hiring approaches from employers. Employers will need to hire for skills 
and competencies rather than credentials, recruit from overlooked populations (such as 
rural workers and people with disabilities), and deliver training that keeps pace with their 
evolving needs.

Executive summary 

The US labor market is going through a rapid evolution in the way people work and the work 
people do. Months after MGI released its last report on the future of work in America, the world 
found itself battling a global pandemic.1 Since then, the US job market has come roaring back 
from its sudden drop. The nature of work has changed as many workers have stuck with remote 
or hybrid models and employers have sped up their adoption of automation technologies. More 
recently, the accelerated development of generative AI, with its advanced natural language 
capabilities, has extended the possibilities for automation to a much wider set of occupations. 

Amid this disruption, workers changed jobs at a remarkable pace—and a subset made bigger 
leaps and moved into entirely different occupations. Some 8.6 million occupational shifts took 
place from 2019 through 2022. Now even more change is in store. We expect an additional 
12 million occupational shifts by 2030. The total number of transitions through 2030 could be 
25 percent higher than we projected a little over two years ago.2 

Multiple forces are set to fuel growth in certain occupations and erode jobs in others. They 
generally fall into three categories: automation, including generative AI; an injection of federal 
investment into infrastructure and the net-zero transition; and long-term structural trends such 
as aging, continuing investment in technology, and the growth of e-commerce and remote work. 
We do not forecast how aggregated employment may be affected by the business cycle in the 
short term; instead, we focus on how these forces may reshape the composition of labor demand 
over the long term. 

Across a majority of occupations (employing 75 percent of the workforce), the pandemic 
accelerated trends that could persist through the end of the decade. Occupations that took a hit 
during the downturn are likely to continue shrinking over time. These include customer-facing 
roles affected by the shift to e-commerce and office support roles that could be eliminated 
either by automation or by fewer people coming into physical offices. Declines in food services, 
customer service and sales, office support, and production work could account for almost  
ten million (more than 84 percent) of the 12 million occupational shifts expected by 2030. 

Multiple forces are set to fuel 
growth in certain occupations 
and erode jobs in others.

By contrast, occupations in business and legal professions, management, healthcare, 
transportation, and STEM were resilient during the pandemic and are poised for continued 
growth. These categories are expected to see fewer than one million occupational shifts 
by 2030. 

For the other categories that account for the remaining one million occupational shifts still to 
come, the pandemic was a temporary headwind. Employment in fields like education and training 
should rise in the years ahead amid a continuous need for early education and lifelong learning. 
Demand for construction workers also stalled during the height of the pandemic but is expected 
to rebound strongly. 

The changes estimated in our earlier research are happening even faster and on an even bigger 
scale than expected. It is becoming even more urgent to solve occupational and geographic 
mismatches and connect workers with the training they need to land jobs with better prospects. 
The fact that workers have been willing to pivot and change career paths, while a tighter labor 
market encouraged companies to hire from broader applicant pools, gives cause for optimism—
but not complacency. The future of work is already here, and it’s moving fast.

In a tighter labor market, workers have been moving 
into new roles, accelerating occupational shifts
By the end of 2022, employment had bounced back to its 2019 level. But a great deal was in flux. 

Are pandemic-era labor shortages here to stay? 
The quits rate soared to new heights during the pandemic, with roughly 48 million Americans 
leaving their jobs in 2021 and 51 million in 2022. What people did next is not fully evident from 
the data. Some moved into better jobs with higher pay. Others left the labor force, whether out of 
discouragement or for personal or health reasons, and it is unclear if or when they will return.

Total employment hit an all-time high after the pandemic, with many employers encountering 
hiring difficulties. As of April 2023, some ten million positions remained vacant; labor force 
participation had ticked up but was 0.7 percentage point below its prepandemic level. That 
translates into roughly 1.9 million workers who are neither employed nor actively looking for jobs. 
This erosion comes after an extended 20-year trend of steadily falling participation. 

Labor supply may continue to be constrained, given that one in four Americans will be of 
retirement age or older by 2030. Without higher participation rates, increased immigration, 
or meaningful productivity growth, labor shortages could be a lasting issue as the economy 
and the population grow. This remains an open question confronting markets, economists, 
and employers. 

Workers have shown a willingness 
to change career paths, while 
a tighter labor market has 
encouraged companies to hire 
from broader applicant pools.

The Great Attrition obscured deeper shifts
While most attention was focused on soaring quits rates during the pandemic, something more 
structural was also occurring. A subset of people did more than change employers; they moved 
into different occupations altogether. Based on net increases and decreases in employment, 
some 8.6 million occupational shifts took place from 2019 through 2022—50 percent more than 
in the previous three-year period (Exhibit E1).3 While it is impossible to trace individual moves, 
many people left their previous roles and landed better-paying jobs in other occupations.

The majority of these shifts came from people leaving jobs in food services, customer service and 
sales, office support, and production work (such as manufacturing). At the same time, managerial 
and professional roles plus transportation services collectively added close to four million jobs 
from 2019 to 2022. Our previous research had anticipated these types of changes over a longer 
time frame, but the pandemic suddenly accelerated matters. The past few years have been a 
preview of trends we expect to continue through the end of the decade.

More high-wage jobs—and fewer workers taking lower-wage service jobs
Overall employment in low- and middle-wage occupations has fallen from prepandemic levels, 
while occupations that pay more than $57,000 annually added about 3.5 million jobs. However, it 
is unclear how many higher-paying roles were filled by people who moved up and how many were 
filled by new entrants to the labor force. Meanwhile, the number of lower-wage job openings has 
not declined. Demand for lower-wage service work remains, but fewer workers are accepting 
these roles. 

What is clear from the job switching and occupational shifts of the past three years is that the 
US labor market accommodated a higher level of dynamic movement. Spiking demand and 
labor scarcity forced many employers to consider nontraditional candidates with potential and 
train them if they lacked direct experience. While this may not hold in the future, employers and 
workers alike can draw on what they have learned about the potential for people to make quick 
pivots and add new skills.

Automation and other forces will continue to reshape the labor market 
Automation, from industrial robots to automated document processing systems, continues to 
be the biggest factor in changing the demand for various occupations. Generative AI is both 
accelerating automation and extending it to an entirely new set of occupations. While this 
technology is advancing rapidly, other forces are also affecting labor demand. Overall, we expect 
significant shifts in the occupational mix in the United States through the end of the decade. 

The effects of automation and generative AI
Automation has taken a leap forward with the recent introduction of generative AI tools. 
“Generative” refers to the fact that these tools can identify patterns across enormous sets of data 
and generate new content—an ability that has often been considered uniquely human. Their most 
striking advance is in natural language capabilities, which are required for a large number of work 
activities. While ChatGPT is focused on text, other AI systems from major platforms can generate 
images, video, and audio. 

Although generative AI is still in the early stages, the potential applications for businesses are 
significant and wide-ranging. Generative AI can be used to write code, design products, create 
marketing content and strategies, streamline operations, analyze legal documents, provide 
customer service via chatbots, and even accelerate scientific discovery. It can be used on its own 
or with “humans in the loop”; the latter is more likely at present, given its current level of maturity. 

3  Measured as net job losses for individual occupations across sectors, net of estimated retirements; derived from US Bureau 
of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. An administrative assistant who takes a similar position with another employer has simply 
switched jobs and is not part of this analysis. If that person becomes an office manager, they have changed occupations 
within the same category (office support). If they become a computer systems analyst, they have moved into a different 
occupational category (STEM professionals). The latter two moves are the kind of occupational shifts that we measure. Since 
we are unable to trace exactly how individual workers moved, we use net declines as a broad proxy. In our forward-looking 
scenario, we refer to people needing to make transitions if demand is projected to decline in their current occupation.

All of this means that automation is about to affect a wider set of work activities involving 
expertise, interaction with people, and creativity. The timeline for automation adoption could be 
sharply accelerated. Without generative AI, our research estimated, automation could take over 
tasks accounting for 21.5 percent of the hours worked in the US economy by 2030. With it, that 
share has now jumped to 29.5 percent (Exhibit E2).4

Other forces affecting future labor demand
Automation is not occurring in a vacuum, of course. Other trends are affecting the demand for 
certain occupations, and we expect the employment mix to change significantly through 2030, 
with more healthcare, STEM, and managerial positions and fewer jobs in customer service, office 
support, and food services. 

 — Federal investment: Recent federal legislation is driving momentum and investment in 
other areas that will affect jobs.5 Reaching the net-zero emissions goal is one of these 
priorities. Some 3.5 million jobs could be displaced through direct and indirect effects across 
the economy. But at the macro level, these losses should be more than offset by gains of 
4.2 million jobs, primarily led by capital expenditures on renewable energy. The net-zero 
transition will likely be a net positive for jobs, but those jobs may be located in different places 
and require different skills. 

Similarly, major investment in infrastructure projects across the country will bolster 
construction jobs, which could see employment growth of 12 percent from 2022 through 
2030. However, the sector already had some 383,000 unfilled positions in April 2023. This 
shortage will have to be addressed to bring infrastructure projects to life from coast to coast.6 

The CHIPS and Science Act is putting additional funding into semiconductor manufacturing 
as well as R&D and scientific research.7 This comes at a time when some companies have 
been adjusting their supply chains, leading to an uptick in domestic manufacturing. While 
manufacturing is likely to boost employment demand overall in the years ahead, the sector is 
becoming more high-tech. It will involve fewer traditional production jobs than in the past but 
more workers with technical and STEM skills.8 

 — Other structural trends: At the same time, other trends like rising incomes and education 
levels will sustain jobs. An aging population will need more healthcare workers in multiple 
roles, while the ongoing process of digitizing the economy will require adding more tech 
workers in every sector.

Putting it all together, the mix of jobs is changing, and we 
anticipate an additional 12 million occupational shifts
One of the biggest questions of recent months is whether generative AI might wipe out jobs. Our 
research does not lead us to that conclusion, although we cannot definitively rule out job losses, 
at least in the short term. Technological advances often cause disruption, but historically, they 
eventually fuel economic and employment growth.  

This research does not predict aggregated future employment levels; instead, we model various 
drivers of labor demand to look at how the mix of jobs might change—and those results yield 
some gains and some losses.9 In fact, the occupational categories most exposed to generative 
AI could continue to add jobs through 2030 (Exhibit E3), although its adoption may slow their 
rate of growth. And even as automation takes hold, investment and structural drivers will support 
employment. The biggest impact for knowledge workers that we can state with certainty is that 
generative AI is likely to significantly change their mix of work activities.

 While our scenario includes the impact of federal investment in the net-zero transition and infrastructure, it does not include 
the full impact of the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, since implementation remained unclear at the 
time of this analysis. However, both pieces of legislation point to the possibility of additional upside.
 Garo Hovnanian, Adi Kumar, and Ryan Luby, “Will a labor crunch derail plans to upgrade US infrastructure?” McKinsey & 
Company, October 2022.

7  Note that both the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act create room for additional upside in employment. 

But since there is still uncertainty about their implementation as of this writing, their effects on jobs are not explicitly 
incorporated into our scenario.

technology can create a better, faster, stronger America, Public Affairs, 2022.

Resilient and growing occupational categories 
The largest future job gains are expected to be in healthcare, an industry that already has an 
imbalance, with 1.9 million unfilled openings as of April 2023. We estimate that there could be 
demand for 3.5 million more jobs for health aides, health technicians, and wellness workers, plus 
an additional two million healthcare professionals.10

By 2030, we further estimate a 23 percent increase in the demand for STEM jobs. Although 
layoffs in the tech sector have been making headlines in 2023, this does not change the longer-
term demand for tech talent among companies of all sizes and sectors as the economy continues 
to digitize. Employers in banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare, for example, 
are undertaking major digital transformations and need tech workers with advanced skills.11 
In addition, the transportation services category is expected to see job growth of 9 percent 
by 2030. 

Declining occupational categories
The biggest future job losses are likely to occur in office support, customer service, and food 
services. We estimate that demand for clerks12 could decrease by 1.6 million jobs, in addition to 
losses of 830,000 for retail salespersons, 710,000 for administrative assistants, and 630,000 
for cashiers. These jobs involve a high share of repetitive tasks, data collection, and elementary 
data processing, all activities that automated systems can handle efficiently. Our analysis also 
finds a modest decline in production jobs despite an upswing in the overall US manufacturing 
sector, which is explained by the fact that the sector increasingly requires fewer traditional 
production jobs but more skilled technical and digital roles.13 

We estimate that 11.8 million workers currently in occupations with shrinking demand may need 
to move into different lines of work by 2030. Roughly nine million of them may wind up moving 
into different occupational categories altogether. Considering what has already transpired, that 
would bring the total number of occupational transitions through the decade’s end to a level 
almost 25 percent higher than our earlier estimates, creating a more pronounced shift in the mix 
of jobs across the economy. 

Overall, we expect more growth in demand for jobs requiring higher levels of education and skills, 
plus declines in roles that typically do not require college degrees (Exhibit E4). 

Almost 12 million additional 
occupational transitions may be 
needed by the end of the decade.

Workers in jobs with lower wages and educational 
requirements could be the most affected
People in the two lowest wage quintiles (those earning less than $30,800 a year and those 
earning $30,800 to $38,200 a year) are up to 10 and 14 times more likely, respectively, to need to 
change occupations by the end of this decade than the highest earners.14 Changing occupations, 
as opposed to finding a new job within the same occupation, often requires adding new skills and 
is more challenging.

14  Workers in the second-lowest wage quintile (earning $30,800 to $38,200 per year) have an even higher risk of needing 
to transition occupations than the lowest-wage workers, who earn less than $30,800 a year. Replacing the lowest-wage 
workers with technology may not make economic sense, but at a certain wage level, the equation changes. In addition, some 
lower-wage jobs involve unpredictable physical work or customer-facing work that does not lend itself well to automation.

McKinsey Global Institute | Generative AI and the future of work in America

The jobs in the two lowest wage quintiles are disproportionately held today by those with less 
education, women, and people of color. Women are heavily represented in office support and 
customer service, which could shrink by about 3.7 million and 2.0 million jobs, respectively, 
by 2030. Similarly, Black and Hispanic workers are highly concentrated in some shrinking 
occupations within customer service, food services, and production work. 

While our analysis shows a decrease of 1.1 million jobs in the two lowest wage quintiles by 
2030, jobs in the highest wage quintile could grow sharply, by 3.8 million. Helping workers in 
lower-wage, shrinking occupations move into better-paying jobs with more stability will require 
widespread access to training programs, effective job matching, different hiring and training 
practices by employers, and better geographic mobility.

The overall labor market will have higher demand for social-emotional and digital skills. Although 
the demand for basic cognitive and manual skills is likely to decline, physical work is not going 
away. It may still account for just under 31 percent of time spent, driven by growth in sectors such 
as transportation services, construction, and healthcare. 

This period of change can be an opportunity for more inclusive growth 
With the pace of change unlikely to let up, the challenge will be helping workers match up with the 
jobs of the future. While some of this may require large-scale collaboration, individual companies 
can fill many of the gaps by adapting their own approaches to hiring and training. 

Boosting productivity through automation and generative AI
Recent MGI research focused on how to reignite productivity growth in the United States.15 
Automation and reskilling will be vital to this effort. Automation could jump-start lackluster 
productivity while simultaneously easing labor shortages. 

Generative AI has the potential to increase US labor productivity by 0.5 to 0.9 percentage 
points annually through 2030 in a midpoint adoption scenario. The range reflects whether the 
time freed up by automation is redeployed at 2022 productivity levels or 2030 levels, with both 
scenarios accounting for the occupational mix expected in 2030.

Combining generative AI with all other automation technologies, the potential growth could be 
even larger. All types of automation could help drive US productivity growth to 3 to 4 percent 
annually in a midpoint adoption scenario. However, this will require significant action from 
stakeholders across the public and private sector. Workers will need support in learning new 
skills, and other risks associated with generative AI also need to be mitigated and controlled. But 
if worker transitions and risks are well managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to 
economic growth.

To capture the full benefits of generative AI to make knowledge work more productive, 
employers, policy makers, and broader ecosystems would need to establish clear guidelines 
and guardrails—and workers would need to see these tools not as job destroyers but as work 
enhancers. When machines take over dull or unpleasant tasks, people can be left with more 
interesting work that requires creativity, problem-solving, and collaborating with others. Workers 
will need to gain proficiency with these tools and, importantly, use the time that is freed up to 
focus on higher-value activities. When managers automate more of their administrative and 
reporting tasks, for example, they can spend more time on strategic thinking and coaching. 
Similarly, researchers could speed up projects by relying on automation tools to sort and 
synthesize large data sets. 

For employers, doubling down on innovative hiring strategies
Most employers can benefit from using a broader lens in hiring. Instead of insisting on prior 
experience that matches the responsibilities of an open role as closely as possible, organizations 
can evaluate candidates on their capacity to learn, their intrinsic capabilities, and their 
transferable skills.

A great deal of skills development happens on the job. Previous MGI research found that work 
experience contributes 40 percent of the average individual’s lifetime earnings in the United 
States.16 Skills learned through work experience are an even bigger determinant for people 
without educational credentials who start out in lower-wage work. 

Filling the jobs of the future is an opportunity to make the labor market more inclusive. Employers 
may need to reconsider whether some credential requirements are really necessary. Some 
60 percent of US workers have skills gained through experience but lack four-year college 
degrees. Initiatives like Tear the Paper Ceiling are supporting workers who have experience but 
not degrees by raising awareness among employers and providing resources. 

Employers can also recruit from populations that are often overlooked, such as retirees who want 
to return to work, people with employment gaps, and the formerly incarcerated. Remote work, 
for example, is opening up long-needed opportunities for people with disabilities who cannot 
commute and those in rural communities. 

Tackling other structural issues
Women left the workforce in relatively higher numbers than men during the pandemic. It took 
three full years for the number of working women in the United States to fully bounce back. Many 
women doing lower-wage work have family obligations that may leave them feeling that they can’t 
take the risk of going back to school or trying a new occupation. Beyond the hiring practices that 
can encourage and enable women to make career transitions, the need for affordable childcare  
remains a major barrier.17 To address it, a number of private-sector employers are expanding 
childcare benefits, while some state and local governments are providing tax credits, subsidies, 
or direct funding. In addition, historically male-dominated fields such as construction that are 
facing labor shortages can fill those gaps with more women, improving diversity in the process.

One key area of job demand is in caregiving, which is critical social infrastructure. We anticipate 
that the two fastest-growing occupations through the end of this decade will be nurses and home 
healthcare aides.18 Childcare workers, as noted above, provide a vital service to working families. 
But people have been leaving these types of jobs in droves. Meeting these growing needs 
will likely hinge on upgrading the quality of what are today typically low-paying jobs with little 
security or advancement opportunities.

While large employers may be able to handle their own training needs, the magnitude of the 
reskilling challenge for the nation as a whole calls for broader partnerships with industry groups, 
educational providers, and nonprofits as well as incentives for investing in human capital. 
Addressing the need for reskilling with efforts beyond individual companies would help spread 
the cost, addressing the concerns of employers who might be reluctant to invest in training for 
employees who can subsequently leave. 

With millions of jobs potentially being eliminated by automation—and even more being created 
in fields requiring different skills—the United States needs broad access to effective training 
programs as well as job-matching assistance that can help individuals find opportunities. 
Many initiatives are in place, but it will be critical to dramatically scale up what works and take 
a proactive approach to filling key shortages. One promising solution, still in the early stages, 
involves digital learning and employment records—a kind of digital microcredential that can 
document how an individual worker has acquired skills and also translate across companies and 
over time.

The US labor market has been remarkably resilient in the face of recent challenges and rapid 
changes. That kind of adaptability is exactly what it will take to navigate the next chapter as well, 
supporting individuals while helping businesses meet their talent needs so they can continue 
driving growth.

Introduction

This report offers a fresh look at how the future of work could shape up for the United States. 
It’s a timely moment to take stock; the landscape has changed dramatically since the McKinsey 
Global Institute published research on automation and the US workplace in 2019. We found that 
the trends we were anticipating in our previous research have indeed been unfolding—and even 
faster than our research originally indicated.

The US labor market had just come out of the pandemic when a revolutionary technology 
development burst on the scene. ChatGPT, along with other generative AI tools, attracted 
millions of users virtually overnight. The potential applications for cognitive and creative tasks 
have raised questions about the implications for workers. This research attempts to answer those 
questions while putting generative AI in context with many other trends that are likely to raise or 
lower demand for certain occupations. 

Our forward-looking analysis incorporates the pandemic-era changes that appear to be lasting, 
along with new estimates for technology adoption and advancement. This time, it also considers 
trends fueled by major infusions of federal investment in the clean-energy transition and the 
renewal of the nation’s infrastructure.19 Our primary focus is on labor demand, although we 
include some observations about the future labor supply and how technology might change the 
day-to-day nature of work. 

We look to the future with full awareness of how much is uncertain. Some data on what is 
occurring today is still limited, and future disruptions could always change the trajectory. This 
research is not meant to provide a short-term job forecast affected by fluctuations in the 
business cycle. Instead, it offers a longer-term structural view of how the US labor market could 
keep evolving. 

The clear takeaway is the need to prepare for continued big occupational shifts in the years 
ahead. Millions of jobs could be phased out even as new ones are created. Preparing American 
workers for the jobs of the future is a top priority for leaders across the private, public, and social 
sectors. If handled well, this period of change could create a more inclusive economy with higher 
productivity growth. 

The future of work is no longer something to look for over the horizon. We’re already in the midst 
of it.

19  While our scenario includes the impact of federal investment in the net-zero transition and infrastructure, it does not include 
the full impact of the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, since implementation remained unclear at the 
time of this analysis. However, both pieces of legislation point to the possibility of additional upside.

1.  A robust recovery 
marked by job 
switching and 
labor shortages 

Gaining a clearer picture of how America’s future of work could shape up through the end of this 
decade involves taking the nation’s new starting point into account. More than two years after 
the initial COVID-19 shutdowns, the US labor market has regained its footing, with the economy 
continuing to add jobs steadily. The unemployment rate dipped below 4 percent at the beginning 
of 2022 and has remained there through the first half of 2023.

Against the backdrop of a tight labor market, a massive wave of job switching occurred. About 
48 million people quit their jobs in 2021, followed by 51 million in 2022. With openings readily 
available, many workers felt empowered to seek out new positions that offered higher pay or 
better alignment with priorities such as flexibility or opportunities to advance.20

A subset of those people did more than simply change employers while doing essentially the 
same job. They moved into different occupations altogether, accelerating shifts in the mix of 
employment that our ongoing body of research has been anticipating. In this chapter, we take 
stock of these recent changes, which inform the updated baseline and reaffirm some of the 
drivers of labor demand used in our refreshed research. 

The pandemic changed the mix of employment, with 
tougher implications for workers with less education 
From the very start of the pandemic, it was evident that demand would rachet up for some types 
of work and dry up for others, simply due to which occupations were deemed essential or could 
be performed remotely. This unevenness has held true throughout the recovery (Exhibit 1).21 
These changes offer a preview of trends that we expect to continue through the end of 
the decade.

Managerial roles and business, legal, and STEM professions were resilient during the pandemic, 
since these jobs could be done remotely and were often critical to helping businesses navigate 
new challenges. These categories added 3.3 million jobs from 2019 to 2022. At the same time, 
e-commerce fueled growth in transportation services—specifically in warehousing. Jobs for 
stockers and order fillers, for example, grew by more than 30 percent between 2019 to 2022, 
while shipping, receiving, and inventory clerks grew by about 15 percent. These trends are likely 
to continue. 

20  See, for example, Jo Constanz, “The Great Resignation worked: Most job-swappers got a raise,” Bloomberg, July 29, 2022; 
and Te-Ping Chen, “Better pay and career paths drive US workers’ decisions to quit,” Wall Street Journal, March 9, 2022.
21  As of this writing, 2022 is the latest year with detailed data on employment by occupation; see “Occupational Employment 

and Wage Statistics,” US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Most other occupational groups did not recover so quickly, and the categories that took the 
biggest hits are likely to continue declining. During the height of the pandemic, many food service 
jobs were lost. Once businesses reopened their doors, however, they struggled to hire and retain 
workers. While total employment in the leisure and hospitality sector remained down throughout 
2021, it has largely recovered. But as of April 2023, employment specifically in accommodation 
and food services was still slightly below prepandemic levels, with about 40 percent more job 
openings than before the pandemic. 

Customer service and sales roles decreased throughout the pandemic as many brick-and-
mortar retail locations closed. They have recovered slowly; as of 2022, customer service 
employment was still 8 percent below its 2019 level, which equates to 1.3 million fewer jobs. Much 
of this is due to consumers’ changing preferences for e-commerce.22

Office support remained 1 percent below its 2019 levels as of 2022. In a recent McKinsey 
survey, nearly half of respondents said the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated their organization’s 
deployment of automation technologies such as intelligent document management and 
processing tools.23 Office clerks, secretaries, and tellers were most affected, a trend that is likely 
to continue as automation continues to become more ubiquitous.

The recovery in healthcare employment is more nuanced. The overall healthcare sector was 
down about 400,000 jobs from 2019 to 2021, although it has since recovered. While employment 
increased for health professionals, it has continued to lag for health aides, technicians, and 
wellness workers. The issue has not been lack of demand but rather lack of workers. This is likely

due to a combination of burnout, particularly for those in frontline care roles, and workers in the 
lowest-paid roles leaving the field.24 There is potential for shortages to continue unless these 
roles can become more attractive for workers.

Mirroring the uneven gains and losses across occupations were uneven effects for different 
segments of the labor force. Those without four-year college degrees were harder hit than 
college-educated workers. People of color disproportionately struggled since they were 
overrepresented in occupations that sustained losses. While the national unemployment 
rate during COVID-19 peaked at 14.7 percent in April 2020, it hit 18.8 percent for Hispanic 
workers in the same month and 16.9 percent for Black workers a month later. Women were also 
concentrated in sectors such as accommodation and education, which shed about 700,000 and 
300,000 jobs, respectively, between 2019 and 2022. 

In the economic recovery, the United States developed a labor shortage 
As of May 2023, total employment stood at two million above its prepandemic level. While labor 
force participation has ticked back up, it remained 0.7 percentage point below where it was 
in February 2020. That translates into roughly 1.9 million fewer workers at a time when about 
ten million positions remained vacant. The job market was also tight in 2018 and 2019, but the 
postpandemic labor shortage has been even more pronounced. In fact, taking a longer historical 
view, labor force participation has been steadily falling, from 67.3 percent in January 2000 to 
62.6 percent in May 2023. 

Despite a wave of white-collar layoffs in 2023 that received substantial media coverage, the job 
market has remained robust overall, especially for blue-collar workers.25 Many employers have 
been coping with unfilled positions and competing for talent. This has driven wages upward, in 
stark contrast to the prolonged weak jobs recovery that followed the Great Recession of 2008. 

Where are the workers?
A great deal of uncertainty surrounds the current labor shortage. It is unclear whether people 
have left the labor force permanently or might return. Several drivers help to explain at least part 
of what is going on and shed light on who might be drawn back in to meet future demand and fill 
more of the ten million positions that are vacant today as well as those that will be created at a 
time when the workforce is shrinking due to aging.26

 — People have retired. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), labor force 
participation for Americans over age 65 fell from 20.8 percent in February 2020 to 
19.1 percent in May 2023. Additionally, some workers in their late 50s and early 60s exited 
the workforce early. One study estimates that half of the recent increase in retirements was 
driven by “excess retirements” above the prepandemic trend line. This translates into roughly 
1.6 million missing older workers.27 

 — People have quit. During the pandemic, an unprecedented number of workers headed for 
the exits, roughly a third of whom left without having their next jobs lined up.28 While many 
people landed new positions, others appear to have left the workforce, whether temporarily 
or permanently.

 — Health concerns are taking a significant if hard-to-measure toll. While data is scarce, 
some people stricken with COVID-19 struggle with long-term effects that hamper their 
ability to work.29 In addition, studies have documented a rise in burnout and mental 
health challenges.30 

 — Immigration was stalled for an extended period. Immigrants have always been part of 

the American labor force. But migration into the United States began dropping in 2016, and 
pandemic-related restrictions accelerated the decline further. The number of foreign-born 
workers experienced a sharp decline from the onset of the pandemic. In 2016, more than 
a million immigrants (including asylum seekers, students, and holders of both work and 
immigrant visas) entered the country. By 2021, that number was down to fewer than 400,000. 
Those annual drops compound over time. Keeping 2014–16 levels of net international 
migration in place, for example, would have added 1.7 million people over 2017–21. However, 
immigration is estimated to have rebounded in 2022, with net international migration 
returning to 2018 levels.31 The foreign-born share of the US labor force was higher than the 
prepandemic level as of May 2023.32

Whether current hiring difficulties turn out to be a preview of a lasting structural issue is the 
question of the moment for markets, economists, and employers; it is also the subject of 
forthcoming research from MGI. What we do know is that the tight environment is driving home 
the urgency of ensuring that critical occupations are filled and that people have opportunities to 
add the skills required to move into these roles. 

Millions of workers not only changed jobs but 
made bigger leaps into new occupations 
The Great Attrition saw Americans switching jobs in record numbers. Within that group, a 
significant subset of people not only changed employers but took up entirely new lines of work.

We estimate that some 8.6 million occupational shifts took place between 2019 and 2022—an 
increase of almost 50 percent from the preceding three-year period.33 Declines in food services, 
customer service and sales, office support, and production accounted for more than half of these 
transitions (Exhibit 2). Losses in these categories are part of a longer-term structural change that 
we expect to continue.

derived from BLS data. An administrative assistant who leaves one employer to take a similar position with another has simply 
switched jobs and is not part of this analysis. If that person becomes an office manager, they have changed occupations 
within the same category (office support). If they become a computer systems analyst, they have moved into a different 
occupational category (STEM professionals). The latter two moves are the kind of occupational shifts that we measure. Since 
we are unable to trace exactly how individual workers moved, we use net declines as a broad proxy for how labor demand and 
supply have changed across occupations. In our forward-looking scenario, we refer to people needing to make transitions if 
labor demand in their current occupation is projected to decline.

In the wake of all this switching, more Americans are now employed in higher-wage occupations 
than before the pandemic, even beyond the effects of wage inflation. Overall employment in 
lower-wage occupations (which we define as those paying less than $35,000 annually) has 
fallen by 3.7 percent.34 Meanwhile, middle-wage occupations (those paying $35,000 to $57,000 
annually) stayed roughly constant, with a small rise of 0.1 percent. By contrast, the number of 
people in higher-wage occupations (earning more than $57,000 annually) is up 9 percent. This 
slice of the labor market has added about 3.5 million jobs. 

We lack clear data on how individuals moved from job to job; some may have shifted more than 
once. Many Americans who changed jobs did land positions with higher pay.35 But some portion 
of the growth in higher-wage employment could be attributed to new entrants to the labor force 
with higher levels of education. Some of the job losses in lower-wage occupations may be due to 
people opting not to take on that work, driven by either choice or inability. 

At the same time, the number of lower-wage job openings has not declined. Demand to fill 
lower-wage service jobs persists, but fewer candidates want these jobs. Employers are having 
hiring difficulties for many roles that do not require college degrees. Improvements in job 
quality, pay, benefits, a stronger promise of career advancement, or a higher level of automation 
may be necessary to resolve these shortages. As the next chapter suggests, some lower-
wage occupations (such as home healthcare aides) will be in high demand in the future, too. 
Improvements in job quality, pay, benefits, a stronger promise of career advancement, or a higher 
level of automation may be necessary to resolve these shortages.

Improvements in job quality, pay, 
benefits, a stronger promise of 
career advancement, or a higher

in lower-wage occupations.

34  We split occupations into three bands, designating the bottom 30 percent as lower wage, the middle 40 percent as middle 
wage, and the top 30 percent as high wage. These designations were based on the 2022 median annual wage for each 
occupation, weighted by 2022 employment. As of 2022, there were about 40 million Americans in high-wage occupations,  
45 million in middle-wage occupations, and 72 million in lower-wage occupations. The prepandemic January 2020 baseline 
was about 37 million, 45 million, and 75 million, respectively.

35  See, for example, “Majority of US workers changing jobs are seeing real wage gains,” Pew Research Center, July 2022. 

Similarly, the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker shows sharply higher wage gains for workers who switch jobs than for those 
who don’t; see atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.aspx.

2. Job gains and losses 

through 2030 

It is impossible to know exactly what lies ahead, especially in the short term. Yet we can piece 
together a picture of how multiple trends might change the mix of jobs in the US economy by the 
end of the decade.36 

While automation has the biggest impact, our research incorporates a much broader range of 
factors. These include shifts that were accelerated by the pandemic and appear to be lasting, 
including increased remote work and virtual meetings that have reduced demand for business 
travel as well as consumers embracing e-commerce. We also weigh federal investment in 
infrastructure and the net-zero transition, as well as ongoing investment to digitize the economy, 
rising incomes and education levels, the healthcare needs of an aging population, and the 
potential marketization of unpaid domestic and care work. In addition, we assume that some 
new occupations may be created at similar rates as in the past. This approach builds on previous 
MGI research on the future of work as well as McKinsey’s just-published report on generative AI 
more specifically.37 

The resulting analysis shows which occupations can expect to see growing demand and which 
are likely to see job losses. As a result of these changes, we estimate that another 11.8 million 
occupational transitions could occur by 2030. This is on top of the 8.6 million occupational 
shifts that took place from 2019 to 2022. Understanding the nuances of how this might play 
out and who might be affected is critical to ensuring a smooth transition for individuals and 
businesses alike. 

The burning question: Will generative AI be a 
job destroyer for white-collar workers?
One of the burning questions of 2023 is whether generative AI might wipe out a significant share 
of jobs and, if so, which ones.

Our research does not lead us to estimate job losses, although we cannot definitively rule out 
that conclusion, at least in the short term. Technological advances often cause disruption—but 
historically, they have eventually fueled economic and employment growth.  

This research relies on aggregated employment growth projections from the US Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, which assume full employment in the target year (2030).38 While we do not predict 
aggregate employment levels ourselves, we do model various drivers of labor demand to look at 
how the mix of jobs might change—and those results yield some gains and some losses. In fact, 
the occupational categories most exposed to generative AI could continue to add jobs through 
2030, although its adoption may slow their rate of growth (Exhibit 3). 

36  We do not attempt to forecast how employment may be affected by the business cycle in the short term. Our scenario offers a 
longer-term structural view focused on changes in the employment mix. For a deeper discussion of the employment effects of 
generative AI and federal investment in the net-zero transition and infrastructure, see chapter 3.

37  See the following McKinsey and MGI reports: The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,  

June 2023; Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automation, December 2017; The future of work in 
America: People and places, today and tomorrow, July 2019; and The future of work after COVID-19, February 2021.

Even in the absence of job losses, professional roles that have largely been immune to 
automation until now will still feel the effects through substantial changes in how people allocate 
their time at work.39 In the meantime, other forces, such as the aging population and the need for

software and digital tools to continue to be deployed across the economy, will maintain demand 
for healthcare, tech, and other professional roles. 

It is worth noting that business and legal professions and managerial jobs grew during the 
pandemic. Employers need managers to hold operations together, and it is logical that would 
also be the case as new technologies redefine roles. However, within the business and legal 
occupational category, some specific occupations (such as paralegals) appear likely to decline.

Net job gains for healthcare, STEM, construction, and business 
and legal professionals could offset losses elsewhere 
First, let’s consider the occupational categories that are resilient and growing. Healthcare 
jobs are expected to have the highest demand growth, with a 30 percent increase for health 
professionals and similar growth for health aides, technicians, and wellness professionals 
(Exhibit 4). An aging population increases the need for specialized healthcare. In fact, four of the 
ten largest job-creating occupations in our analysis are healthcare roles. Keeping the ratio of 
healthcare workers to the population over age 65 roughly constant with today’s level in 2030, 
we estimate that 3.8 million jobs could be added for registered nurses, personal care assistants, 
home health aides, nursing assistants, licensed practical and vocational nurses, and medical 
assistants. The imbalance between supply and demand is already evident. Many hospitals and 
nursing homes are coping with staffing shortages that can affect the quality of care.40 

Jobs in STEM fields are estimated to grow by 23 percent by 2030. This equates to an average 
annual growth rate of 2.6 percent, which represents an acceleration from the past few years. The 
top-growing occupations include software developers, computer systems analysts, and data 
scientists. Some of this growth is related to the deployment of automation systems themselves. 

Although layoffs in the tech industry have made headlines in 2023, and generative AI can 
handle some of the current work activities done by tech professionals, there is still a great need 
for digital talent in sectors throughout the economy. The sheer scale of ongoing digitization, 
a surge in the number of connected devices, and the growing need to guard against data 
breaches should continue to fuel STEM demand.41 In addition, the CHIPS and Science Act is 
putting additional funding into R&D, scientific research, and STEM workforce development.42 It 
aims to address reliance on imported chips by directing $280 billion toward US semiconductor 
capabilities, including domestic manufacturing, high-tech regional hubs, and developing the 
nation’s STEM workforce.43

The transportation services category is expected to see job growth of 9 percent by 2030, 
driven by the continuing shift toward e-commerce and the delivery economy associated with 
it. We also expect 12 percent growth in construction jobs as infrastructure projects break 
ground nationwide.

42  Note that both the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act create room for additional upside in employment. 
But since uncertainty about their implementation persists as of this writing, our estimates do not explicitly incorporate their 
effects on jobs.

In contrast to the growing categories described above, we expect the biggest declines in office 
support, customer service, and food services—the same categories that took the biggest hits 
during the pandemic. We estimate future losses of 1.6 million clerical jobs, for instance, plus some 
830,000 retail salespeople and 630,000 cashiers (Exhibit 5). Automated systems can efficiently 
handle jobs with a high share of repetitive tasks, data collection, and elementary data processing. 
This trend was looming even before the arrival of generative AI.

The modest expected net losses in production work may seem puzzling in light of recent 
announcements about investments in domestic manufacturing. Manufacturing growth should 
boost overall US employment demand in the years ahead—but the sector is becoming more high-
tech and automated, which will change its mix of occupations. Advanced manufacturing requires 
fewer jobs such as assemblers, packers, and molding machine workers but more jobs such as 
software developers and industrial engineers, which fall into the STEM professional occupational 
category.44 Manufacturing also requires supporting function roles such as market research 
analysts, supply chain managers, and truck drivers.45 

Even more workers may need to make occupational transitions 
Compared with our previous estimates, we now see a larger number of workers potentially 
needing to change occupations through 2030. A transition is needed when someone is 
involuntarily displaced from a job by automation, the shift to e-commerce, the phaseout of a 
high-emissions activity, or some other trend, and they are unable to get a new job in the same 
occupation because demand has declined. 

Some displaced workers may find alternative jobs within the same occupational category. For 
example, a bookkeeping and accounting clerk could take a job as a database administrator; this 
move would involve a change of occupations but keep this individual within the office support 
category. But a displaced waiter who can no longer find a job in food services, a category in 
decline, might need to transition to another type of work altogether. That person might become a 
light truck delivery driver since demand is growing for those roles. 

We find that just under 12 million additional occupational shifts could be needed by 2030 
(Exhibit 6). Of those, some nine million may involve moves into entirely different occupational 
categories (for example, going from a production-related job to one in transportation, or from a 
customer service role to one in arts management). 

People currently working in office support, customer service and sales, production, and food 
service occupations—the same categories that were the source of a majority of shifts during the 
pandemic—account for more than 80 percent of these potential transitions. While this could be 
disruptive for many workers, it could also provide an opportunity. Many of the growing jobs that 
could absorb these displaced workers are in higher wage brackets.

Just under 12 million additional 
occupational transitions 
may be needed by 2030.

3. New forces changing 

labor demand: 
Generative AI and 
federal investment 

America is living through one of its most disruptive economic periods in decades, with pandemic-
driven changes in consumption patterns, an inflationary spike, and a shift to remote work that 
changed the daily habits of a third of all workers. Against this backdrop, the arrival of ChatGPT 
was another seismic event. Some users who initially tried out ChatGPT and the other generative 
AI tools that quickly followed were drawn by curiosity. In subsequent months, many have already 
begun to use these tools to assist in a range of work tasks. 

Other forces are at work, too. One of the biggest recent developments has been the passage 
of legislation that will put significant federal investment into decarbonizing the economy and 
modernizing America’s infrastructure. 

Generative AI and other automation technologies can 
handle a growing range of work activities
Rarely has a tech innovation created such a splash as ChatGPT, which has achieved one of the 
fastest adoption rates in history.46 But what is it exactly, and how could it affect jobs? We consider 
it alongside other automation technologies, many of which are already having major effects, from 
robots on factory floors to automated document processing in back-office functions.  

What is generative AI?
Part of the field known as deep learning, generative AI refers to applications typically built using 
a class of artificial neural networks called foundation models, structures inspired by the billions of 
neurons connected in the human brain. These models have taken AI applications to the next level. 

ChatGPT is only one of several new generative AI tools. The “generative” in the name refers to its 
ability to identify patterns across enormous sets of data and generate new content—something 
that has often been considered uniquely human. ChatGPT can be used to write correspondence, 
essays, articles, stories, poetry, and computer code, in addition to scraping the internet for 
information and answering questions.

Another AI tool, Dall-E, can create images and illustrations in multiple styles. Dall-E and similar 
image generators were “trained” by absorbing huge quantities of images and reading their 
captions. They can produce new images as specified by users, in a variety of styles, and even 
take stories and turn them into illustrated storyboards. Other AI systems from major platforms

Much of the buzz today is about users interacting with these systems for fun or to satisfy 
their curiosity. But the potential applications for businesses are exceptionally wide-ranging. 
Generative AI can be used to write code, design products, create marketing content and 
strategies, streamline operations, analyze legal documents, provide customer service via 
chatbots, or even accelerate scientific discovery. The ability to generate images is the first step 
toward creating immersive experiences. 

Generative AI is still in the early stages, and these tools are far from perfect. They can produce 
inaccurate results, and many legal, ethical, and intellectual property questions still need to 
be resolved.

What types of work can it do?
One of the biggest leaps forward in AI is in natural language capabilities, which are required for 
a large number of work activities. Previously, these were not expected to match median human 
performance for natural language understanding until around 2028 at the earliest, but they are 
already reaching that point today. 

These advances mean that automation is about to affect a wider set of work activities. As a 
result, the share of hours spent on work tasks today across the US economy that have the 
technical potential to be automated with currently demonstrated technologies has jumped from 
44 percent to 62 percent in our midpoint scenario.47 

But technical potential does not always match what happens on the ground. It is the theoretical 
maximum that could be automated, considering current technological capabilities at any 
given time. But not everything that could be done in a theoretical world would be adopted by 
businesses. The pace of actual adoption typically lags behind technical potential. It is affected 
by the time needed for solution integration, whether it is economically feasible to replace human 
labor with technology, and multiple other barriers such as customer acceptance, labor laws, and 
companies lacking the right workforce skills. 

Yet the introduction of generative AI has sharply accelerated the timeline for automation 
adoption, since these tools are easy to access and integrate and are relatively low cost. Without 
generative AI, we estimate that automation could take over tasks accounting for 21.5 percent of 
the hours currently worked in the US economy by 2030. With it, that share jumps to 29.5 percent 
(Exhibit 7).48 This includes a significant increase in tasks involving expertise, interactions with 
people, and even creativity.49 Tasks requiring physical work, by contrast, are expected to be 
less affected. 

One of the biggest leaps forward 
in AI is in natural language 
capabilities, which are required for 
a large number of work activities. 

47  The midpoint scenario is the average of the early and late automation adoption scenarios referenced in McKinsey’s recent 

report The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier (June 2023).

48  This is the average of a very wide range, from 3.7 to 55.3 percent.

Exhibit 8 shows how this might play out across occupational categories. Labor economists have 
often noted that the deployment of automation technologies tends to most affect workers with 
the lowest levels of skills, as measured by educational attainment; in other words, automation 
has been “skill biased.” Generative AI turns that on its head, however, automating some of 
the activities of knowledge workers at the higher end of the income spectrum.50 However, it is 
important to note that other types of automation technologies are continuing to affect lower-
wage occupational categories.

Computer programmers, scientific researchers, market researchers, translators, and financial 
advisers are just a small sample of the specific occupations that could be affected. A recently 
published report from MGI found the greatest potential economic value could be unlocked in 
customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D.51

Looking in more detail at specific occupations, we see the biggest impact of generative AI 
occurring for lawyers (Exhibit 9). Generative AI can search through case law for the most relevant 
precedents, freeing lawyers to think through how to apply them in new legal arguments. Lawyers 
also spend a great deal of time tailoring form documents, but they could use generative AI 
to take the first cut and then quickly edit.52 In a completely different field, civil engineers can 
use generative AI to accelerate the design process, taking all building codes into account for 
fewer errors and less rework, particularly when it comes to complex mechanical, electrical, and 
plumbing systems. Generative AI can also enable engineering to explore alternative designs 
quickly to find the option with the best energy efficiency or the lowest use of materials. Making 
engineering and architecture more productive is vital at a time when the nation needs to deliver 
more affordable housing and major infrastructure projects.

Changing the way people work
Before the arrival of generative AI, the pandemic accelerated the adoption of automation systems 
as many employers scrambled to respond. For greater flexibility to meet erratic demand, for 
example, retailers including Amazon, Walmart, and Target started to enlist industrial robots to 
pick, sort, and track merchandise in their warehouses. Restaurants shifted to automated order 
taking, while many retailers opted for self-checkout and touchless technology.

It is important to note that automation adoption is not the same as eliminating jobs. Many jobs 
with some automatable tasks will remain, but the day-to-day nature of what people do and how 
they do it changes. In fact, employment demand should continue to rise in many occupations 
most exposed to generative AI, although perhaps at a slower rate. 

Generative AI and other automation technologies could help the United States reignite its 
flagging productivity growth, partially compensating for declining employment growth as 
the population ages.53 Capturing that effect means that workers would have to use these 
technologies properly and effectively. 

Importantly, individuals would need to use the time that is freed up to focus on higher-value 
activities. Managers, for instance, could rely on automation for mundane administrative and 
reporting tasks and use the time saved to provide more one-on-one coaching. Researchers 
could dramatically reduce the time they spend sorting and synthesizing data or conducting 
literature searches of existing studies, spending more time on original contributions and 
speeding research projects. Teachers could use generative AI to grade tests and flesh out lesson 
plans (at least partially) and focus more of their energy on interacting with students.54 

Things may be produced faster, potentially with smaller teams. If generative AI can create 
intricate storyboards, animated films could be produced with fewer artists, although artists would 
still provide the ideas and shape what the tools produce. Generative AI can compose technical 
writing, but writers will still need to report, edit, think, and apply real-world judgment. At the 
moment, these tools might be best used to produce first drafts in creative fields—but assistance 
with first drafts can be a major productivity lift. 

While automation tends to dominate the conversation when it comes to the future of work, it is 
not the only force at work. The remainder of this chapter will touch on the ways that investment 
priorities shape the labor market. 

An infusion of federal investment is poised to shift employment 
demand to greener sectors and boost construction 
While technology is evolving, other priorities are coming to the forefront. The United States has 
recently passed major funding bills that will change the scope of employment demand across the 
country, including the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS 
and Science Act. 

Funding for the net-zero transition
The United States, along with other countries, has made a formal international commitment 
to address climate change by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero by 2050 at the 
latest.55 Meeting this target requires extensive groundwork to transform everything from energy 
generation and transmission to transportation, industry, and agriculture. These changes are 
already getting under way and will continue to do so through 2030. The Inflation Reduction 
Act, passed in August 2022, adds both public funding and momentum, although its precise 
implementation was not clear at the time of our analysis.

The net-zero transition could reallocate a substantial number of American jobs. To estimate 
these effects, we build on previous McKinsey research assessing the impact at a global level and 
zoom in on the United States.56 We use a scenario-based analysis, drawing on the approach used 
by the Network for Greening the Financial System.57 

We estimate that the effort to get to net zero could create a net gain of some 700,000 jobs in 
the United States by 2030. But the churn could be far greater than this number implies. Some 
3.5 million jobs could be lost through direct and indirect effects across the economy. This should 
be more than offset by a gain of 4.2 million positions, primarily led by capital expenditures 
on renewable energy.58 However, the new jobs may be in different locations and require 
different skills.

Our estimates point to job growth in fields such as renewable power generation and storage—
positions such as wind turbine technicians, electrical engineers, and solar photovoltaic installers. 
Capital spending to build low-emissions facilities and retrofit existing plants and buildings 
with cleaner technologies is expected to drive demand for construction and specialized 
manufacturing workers. At the same time, the economy will need fewer jobs in carbon-intensive 
industries, particularly oil, gas, and mining. Some of these shifts are already playing out: the US 
solar industry currently employs twice as many workers as the nation’s coal industry, and it is 
struggling to hire quickly enough to keep up with its rapid expansion.59 

Our findings are based on an “orderly transition” scenario—and it is important to note that the 
impact on the labor market could be more severe if the transition is “disorderly” (for example, 
if the shift away from fossil fuels occurs before a sufficient and reliable supply of renewables 
is ready to deliver). Power disruptions and spikes in energy prices would have economic ripple 
effects that could lead to more abrupt job losses.

To ensure that the availability of workers does not become a bottleneck to achieving its climate 
goals, the United States will need to develop the skills required for the jobs that will be in demand 
in a greener economy. Training and redeployment will be especially important in regions where 
industries such as oil refining and traditional auto manufacturing are major employers. Specific 
communities could face significant displacement as legacy industries shrink, while others that 
seed green industries could enjoy more robust job growth. Geographic mismatches and the 
availability of retraining programs will determine to a large extent whether this process is smooth. 
Identifying transferable skills can illuminate some of the most viable pathways and inform 
retraining efforts (Exhibit 10).

could reallocate a substantial 
number of American jobs.

Renewing America’s infrastructure 
Recent federal commitments to expand and revitalize infrastructure could boost employment 
and eventually improve the overall productivity of the US economy. But labor shortages in the 
construction and manufacturing sectors will need to be addressed in order to achieve these 
national priorities.60 

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, signed in 2021, includes $1.2 trillion in federal funding, almost 
half of which is new spending. This investment will go to a variety of projects nationwide: repairing 
roads and bridges, rebuilding water infrastructure to eliminate lead pipes, expanding high-
speed internet, improving public transit and passenger rail, modernizing ports and airports, and 
building a national electric vehicle charging network.61 To put this into perspective, the legislation 
will boost federal infrastructure spending during the next five years to almost the same average 
share of GDP spent during the New Deal from 1933 to 1937.62

Box 1
Seizing the electric vehicle opportunity 

Transportation accounted for a larger share (37 percent) of 
the nation’s CO2 emissions in 2021 than any other sector.1 
Switching to electric vehicles (EVs) is therefore critical to 
getting to net zero. The federal government has set a goal 
that half of all vehicles sold by 2030 should be electric; it 
recently committed $7.5 billion to help set up a national 
charging system as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
and established tax credits for the purchase of EVs as part 
of the Inflation Reduction Act.2 

This will be a massive shift, creating disruption for current 
market participants and legacy automotive employees. EVs 
have fewer moving parts than traditional internal combustion 
engines, which makes their production less labor-intensive. 
This may result in job losses for assembly line workers, 
molders, and machinists. 

Even as demand falls for traditional automotive production 
roles, automakers will need more tech-oriented workers, 
from software developers and IT managers to computer 
hardware engineers. EVs require expertise in chemical 
and electronic engineering in their design, testing, and 
repair. 3 The industry will have a heavier emphasis on 
electronics, mechatronics and calibration, advanced 
materials, and additive manufacturing. There may be a 

need to repurpose engineering talent toward electrical and 
electronics specialties.

EVs run on thousands of chips—in fact, roughly double the 
number found in conventional vehicles.4 Manufacturers ran 
into shortages in 2022, and McKinsey has estimated that 
automotive semiconductor demand could rise by about 
11 percent annually through 2030. The CHIPS and Science 
Act of 2022 aims to address US reliance on imported 
chips by directing $280 billion toward US semiconductor 
capabilities, including domestic manufacturing, high-tech 
regional hubs, and developing the nation’s STEM workforce. 
Intel has broken ground on a new $20 billion semiconductor 
factory in Ohio; this is on top of $20 billion to expand 
its production footprint in Arizona, a state that has also 
captured one of the largest foreign investments in US history 
from chip giant TSMC.5

New types of jobs associated with EVs are already growing 
as production takes root in states including California, 
Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee. 
Established automakers are opening battery hubs 
in Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and 
Tennessee. Additional jobs will be created to produce and 
install charging equipment and infrastructure nationwide.

In 2022, the infrastructure law was followed by the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes an 
additional $369 billion in complementary funding. Its provisions are meant to spur domestic 
manufacturing and energy efficiency upgrades, decarbonize and shore up the US electric grid, 
establish a national green bank, and improve resilience in agriculture and rural areas.63 However, 
both pieces of legislation establish myriad programs, with much of the funding directed toward 
state and local governments through competitive grants. Coordination and implementation will 
be complex, and the full impact will take time to manifest.64 

From a labor market perspective, the United States will need to address its existing shortage of 
construction workers to realize these plans. Employment has stalled, but demand is growing. We 
estimate that jobs in the construction sector could increase by 12 percent by 2030, translating to 

63  Savannah Bertrand, “How the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law work together to advance climate 

action,” Environmental and Energy Study Institute, September 2022.

64  See, for example, “Delivering on the promise of federal infrastructure funds in states,” McKinsey & Company, May 2022; and 

“A new era of infrastructure grants,” McKinsey & Company, May 2022.

more than a million net jobs gained, in addition to growth in affiliated sectors. The construction 
sector could also see significant increases in labor demand from other factors, such as the need 
to rebuild in the aftermath of natural disasters.65 

In the peak years of infrastructure spending, about half of the demand for labor may come from 
contractor roles in the construction industry itself. Another large share, just over 40 percent, 
is likely to come from the materials sector, which combines manufacturing, distribution, and 
warehousing.66 This part of the value chain is equally important, since delays and shortages in 
obtaining materials can grind construction projects to a halt or drive up their costs.

In terms of specific occupations within the sector, our estimates indicate that construction 
laborers (with 240,000 positions added), supervisors (150,000), and electricians (130,000) could 
experience the largest growth in demand by 2030. 

Yet the United States already has a shortage of construction workers. Some 490,000 positions 
were unfilled in December 2022—the highest number recorded since industry-level data 
collection began in 2000. This number dropped slightly to roughly 383,000 positions in May 
2023. In September and December 2022, unfilled construction positions exceeded the number 
of unemployed individuals seeking construction jobs. This imbalance is caused by a mix of 
short-term, cyclical, and more structural factors. The workforce is getting older, with the share 
of construction workers age 55 and older having doubled, from 11 to 22.7 percent, between 
2003 and 2022. The industry is also heavily reliant on immigrants (who represent more than 
a quarter of construction workers) at a time when immigration is only now picking up after a 
drop of several years. In addition, women make up only about 10 percent of the construction 
sector’s workforce.67

Most infrastructure development companies are competing with other industries when it comes 
to skilled trades. A large number of welders, for example, will be needed in both manufacturing 
and construction, and without cooperation to train new talent, competition for this small pool 
of skilled tradespeople will only increase. In fact, people with skills crucial to the construction 
industry have broader options. There is competing demand in both construction and logistics for 
truck drivers and freight movers, who are already in short supply. The same goes for electricians, 
who can work for construction companies or utilities.

Addressing these labor shortages is an opportunity to diversify the construction workforce. 
According to the BLS, nine out of ten US construction workers are men; 30 percent are Hispanic; 
and almost 61 percent are non-Hispanic White. Recruiting and training more women and people 
of color can help companies meet the coming demand while diversifying their own workforces 
and expanding opportunity more broadly.

Most infrastructure development 
companies are competing 
with other industries when 
it comes to skilled trades.

4. Who’s vulnerable?

At the heart of it, displacement and change affect workers and their families in significant ways. 
Some of the people most likely to be affected by automation are already living paycheck to 
paycheck, and for them, even a short period of disruption could provoke tremendous stress. 

Millions of Americans may need to switch occupations to find new ways to support themselves. 
Designing interventions starts with identifying exactly who is at risk of displacement. Overlaying 
our analysis showing which occupations have the most automatable activities with data on 
who holds those jobs today paints a picture of uneven effects, since many occupations have 
skewed demographics. 

But what lies ahead is not only about risk; it is also about opportunity. With low-wage jobs 
decreasing, more people could land better-paying jobs if they can access skills training and if 
employers are willing to take more chances in hiring. The United States has no time to lose in 
setting up large-scale retraining programs and better job-matching systems to help people make 
successful transitions.

The decline of low- and middle-wage jobs could 
continue as more high-wage jobs are added
The loss of middle-wage jobs and the resulting polarization in the job market is a well-
documented historical trend.68 While the share of middle-wage jobs is likely to continue declining, 
our analysis finds that lower-wage jobs could see an even faster decrease, especially as office 
support and customer service and sales jobs continue to disappear (Exhibit 11). 

With low-wage jobs decreasing, 
more people could land 
better-paying jobs if they can 
access skills training and if 
employers are willing to take 
more chances in hiring.

While the individuals in low-wage jobs today are most vulnerable due to shrinking demand in 
office support and customer service and sales jobs, this also presents an opportunity to help 
them land better-paying jobs. Looking at this shift from a different vantage point, this could 
be a positive opportunity for more inclusive growth as the US economy rebalances toward 
higher-wage jobs (Exhibit 12). As we will discuss further in chapter 5, training and less rigid hiring 
approaches will be essential to creating those pathways. 

Despite this overall rebalancing toward higher-wage jobs, it is important to note that some of the 
fastest-growing occupations are still some of lowest paying in the economy. Several of these are 
roles that provide vital social and economic infrastructure—most notably home healthcare aides, 
nursing assistants, and childcare workers. These jobs are disproportionately held by women 
(Exhibit 13). Meeting these needs, especially at a time when workers have more options, may 
depend on upgrading the quality of those jobs. Indeed, a shortage of childcare and elder care is 
already keeping some people out of the workforce.

Workers in low-wage jobs and those without college degrees 
are more likely to need to change occupations by 2030
Based on the demographics of various jobs today, workers in lower-wage roles, those with less 
education, women, and people of color are disproportionately represented among those who 
may need to find new types of work by 2030 (Exhibit 14). Workers with these profiles are more 
vulnerable to job displacement and will need support to make successful job transitions. 

 — Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to face the need to change 

occupations. We estimate that almost 80 percent of all potential transitions (affecting some 
9.4 million people) could occur among workers in the two lowest quintiles of wages—that 
is, people earning less than $38,200. Retail salespeople, cashiers, and stockers and order 
fillers all fall within the lowest quintile and could account for some 18 percent of all potential 
transitions by 2030. But notably, the most vulnerable group overall is not the very lowest 
wage bracket; it is those earning between $30,800 and $38,200. This group specifically is  
14 times more likely to need to find new roles by 2030 than the highest-wage earners. 

 — Workers without college degrees are 1.7 times more likely to face displacement and 
the need to change occupations than those with bachelor’s degrees or above. It is well 
established that workers with a high school diploma or less have experienced limited job 
prospects in the United States.69 Assuming the distribution of educational attainment levels 
across occupations remains the same as in 2022, workers without bachelor’s degrees could 
account for about 8.9 million of the estimated 11.8 million occupational shifts (roughly three-
quarters of the total). Notably, 90 percent of production workers are not college educated, 
and about 1.4 million may need to change fields by 2030. Similarly, 72 percent of office 
support workers lack college degrees, and about 4.7 million may need to move to different 
occupations. Higher levels of educational attainment remain strongly positively correlated 
with being in less automatable roles. 

 — The youngest and oldest workers are 1.4 and 1.1 times more likely to face occupational 
changes, respectively. In our estimates, workers between the ages of 18 and 24 and those 
above age 50 are more likely to face job transitions than workers ages 25 to 49. As younger 
workers are just starting their careers and many are likely still attending school, they may be 
better positioned to adapt and find different pathways. But older workers may find it harder to 
start new chapters. 

 — Women are 1.5 times more likely to face occupational transitions than men. Women could 
face 57 percent of all the transitions envisioned in our estimates, which is greater than their 
overall workforce representation of 47 percent. This reflects the fact that women are heavily 
represented in office support and customer service roles, which could shrink by about 
3.7 million and 2.0 million jobs, respectively, by 2030.

 — Hispanic workers are 1.1 times more likely to need to change occupations than White 

workers. Based on the jobs they hold today, Hispanic Americans could account for 2.1 million 
potential job transitions (18 percent of the total through 2030). Much of this is driven by 
relatively higher representation in automatable food service roles. 

 — Black workers are 1.1 times more likely to face occupational changes than White workers. 
Some 1.5 million Black Americans could face the need to change roles, accounting for 
12 percent of all estimated transitions. While the magnitude may seem relatively small, Black 
Americans have experienced higher unemployment rates than White workers since the 
Census Bureau Current Population Survey began publishing data in 1972. Ensuring that Black 
workers in shrinking occupations have pathways to move into high-quality jobs can help to 
relieve labor supply constraints while creating a more inclusive economy.

The workforce of the future will need more technological and 
people skills—but physical work is not disappearing 
To assess the potential shift in demand for workforce skills, we look into the change in skill mix 
for each occupation as well as the change in demand for each occupation, and then aggregate 
them for the country. To assess the skill mix of each occupation, MGI used about 2,100 individual 
work activities that make up more than 850 occupations from O*NET. We mapped each activity 
to a specific skill within five broad categories: physical and manual, basic cognitive, advanced 
cognitive, social and emotional, and technological. The results reaffirm the trends identified in 
our earlier research.

Social and emotional skills and technological skills
Given the impact of automation on individual activities as well as the shifting mix of occupations 
projected in our estimates, we find that social and emotional skills and technological skills will see 
the biggest increase in demand by 2030. These types of skills are particularly important in the 
healthcare and STEM occupations that are poised for strong growth. However, it is possible that 
generative AI could change our definitions and the way these skills are deployed over time.

Social and emotional skills (such as empathy) have always been critical in healthcare, and that 
will remain paramount. But now healthcare delivery increasingly involves the use of digital 
systems as well. One study found that digital content in healthcare roles like registered nurses 
rose by 40 percent or more between 2002 and 2016.70 That is in line with the generally observed 
increase in digital content across jobs in that period. 

Skill shifts within occupations present some opportunities for people to direct more of their 
time to higher-value work. For example, retail employees could spend less time processing 
payments and more time assisting customers and delivering a superior experience. Healthcare 
workers could reallocate time spent filling out insurance paperwork to interacting with patients. 
Importantly, managers can save time on administrative work, freeing them up for more coaching 
and collaboration. Any potential increase in managerial attention to team building and developing 
people is important, especially at a time when being valued by a boss and having a sense of 
belonging are important factors for employees weighing whether to stay in their current jobs.71 

Skill shifts within occupations 
present some opportunities for 
people to direct more of their 
time to higher-value work.

Basic cognitive or physical skills
By contrast, demand will shrink for activities that primarily require basic cognitive skills 
(Exhibit 15). More of the routine tasks associated with office support roles can be handled by 
software and AI, for example, while robots are able to handle tasks in warehouses and assembly 
lines with greater dexterity and accuracy. People who need to move out of declining lower-wage 
occupations that emphasize manual and basic cognitive tasks could have more choices—
including better-paying options—if they can interact with people and digital systems. 

The share of physical work in the US economy could decline slightly, accounting for about 
31 percent of total skills deployed by 2030. 

The recent increase in transportation services employment seems likely to endure, and a 
renewed national focus on infrastructure, climate, and resilience is set to add construction and 
manufacturing jobs, as described in the previous chapter. Some healthcare roles similarly require 
physical skills. The sustained importance of physical and manual skills is also informed by the fact 
that robots do not yet have the sensory abilities and flexibility of the human hand; people with fine 
motor skills can still do many things that machines cannot. 

Additionally, those who stay in the same line of work or even in the same job are not immune to 
change. Technology will alter the day-to-day tasks most Americans perform in the course of 
their jobs. Staying relevant in this rapidly changing environment will mean that workers need to 
continually learn new skills.

5. Preparing for the 
future of work

As automation and other structural trends continue to raise demand for some occupations and 
lower it for others, more turbulence could lie ahead. The Great Attrition caught many employers 
by surprise. But mobility can be a healthy dynamic if it’s fueled by growth and leads people to 
better matches where they can realize their potential. 

Leaders in the business, policy, and education domains can prepare for what comes next by 
keeping employees engaged, helping them add more advanced skills, making training widely 
available, and bringing more people off the sidelines and into the workforce. Instead of watching 
people drop out of the workforce from discouragement, stakeholders will need to help midcareer 
workers reinvent themselves and pull in more of the people who are currently on the sidelines. 
The nation needs clear pathways for people to enter roles that are critical to its priorities, such as 
healthcare and skilled trades involved in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. 

While many new initiatives have gotten under way to help workers add new skills and change 
career paths, this is a moment to double down on what works and commit to creating a more 
inclusive future with greater opportunities for a bigger slice of the workforce. 

The workplace plays a powerful role in 
developing the nation’s human capital
While much of the debate over the future of work focuses on the need for large-scale training 
programs, a great deal of skills development happens day-to-day on the job. Previous MGI 
research on human capital examined the job moves made by millions of workers over a decade 
and found that work experience contributes 40 percent of the average individual’s lifetime 
earnings in the United States. Skills learned on the job are an even bigger determinant for people 
with lower educational credentials who start out in lower-wage work.72 

MGI’s research showed that almost one-third of US workers are on a path to move into higher 
earning brackets, and amassing work experience in an effective way seems to be their key 
to upward mobility. Each job move typically increased wages—and the bolder the move, the 
bigger the boost. Companies with the strongest organizational health, those that offer more 
coaching and training for their employees, and those that provide more opportunities for internal 
advancement seem to help increase lifetime earnings.73 

Most employers can benefit from expanding the lens through which they evaluate candidates. 
Instead of insisting on prior experience that best matches the responsibilities in an open role, 
organizations can shift toward evaluating candidates on their capacity to learn, their intrinsic 
capabilities, and their transferable skills. This requires removing biases that pigeonhole people 
into the roles they are already performing. In our sample, more than half of all role moves 
undertaken by individuals involved a substantial share of new skills, which implies that most 
people are capable of learning and doing more than they are doing today. Employers can benefit 
from being more open to hiring candidates who have taken unconventional career paths.

Capturing the productivity potential of automation, including 
generative AI, requires changing the way people work
The United States urgently needs to jump-start its flagging productivity growth, which has been 
a lackluster 1.4 percent since 2005. Recent MGI research noted that the economy faces looming 
headwinds, including workforce shortages, debt, inflation, and the cost of the energy transition—
and higher productivity will make it easier to navigate these challenges.74 

Technology is one of the critical levers, and generative AI in particular is opening up many 
possibilities for making knowledge work more productive. But employers need to have a 
sustained strategy for implementation that includes complementary investment in talent and 
ecosystems, plus a willingness to update organizational models. Studies have shown that this 
process can create a productivity “J-curve” over time, with small initial benefits eventually 
yielding much bigger long-term value for businesses that stay the course.75 

To capture the full benefits, employers and policy makers would need to establish clear 
guidelines and guardrails for the responsible use of generative AI. Businesses will need to think 
through how jobs and responsibilities could evolve, and workers would need to see these tools 
not as job destroyers but as work enhancers. When machines take over dull or unpleasant tasks, 
people can be left with more interesting work that requires creativity, problem solving, and 
collaborating with others (Exhibit 16).

Importantly, workers would need to become proficient in using AI—and use the time that is freed 
up to focus on higher-value activities. Leaders can spend more time on strategic thinking and 
coaching when they automate more of their administrative and reporting tasks. Researchers 
could speed up projects by relying on automation tools to sort and synthesize large data sets. 
Writers can use generative AI to produce first drafts, then spend time refining and shaping 
the output. 

When machines take over 
dull or unpleasant tasks, 
people can be left with more 
interesting work that requires 
creativity, problem solving, and 
collaborating with others.

Filling the jobs of the future is an opportunity 
to build a more inclusive economy 
The challenge facing the US labor market through the end of this decade will be helping people 
move out of declining occupations, equipping them with new skills, and matching them with 
better opportunities. Filling the jobs with rising demand may require companies to recruit from 
different talent pools—and it creates an opportunity to engage underrepresented groups.76 One 
way to do this is creating new options for work that meet the needs of workers, whether that 
means offering more flexible or part-time roles or hiring freelancers for appropriate tasks.

Remove unnecessary credential requirements
We estimate that workers without four-year college degrees will face 75 percent of all job 
transitions that could occur by 2030. Many of these workers have what it takes to perform 
higher-wage jobs, but they are often passed over. In fact, Americans without bachelor’s 
degrees tend to have lower labor participation overall (58 percent versus 73 percent for college 
graduates), perhaps due in part to discouragement over what kinds of roles they can land. This is 
an enormous population; almost 37 percent of Americans over age 25 have a high school diploma 
or less. An additional 15 percent attended college but did not earn degrees.77 

To help displaced workers find new career paths, more employers will need to begin looking 
beyond educational credentials to consider candidates’ transferable skills, mindset, and 
potential. Companies such as IBM and Hilton are among many that are no longer requiring four-
year degrees during hiring. Pennsylvania recently removed college degrees as a prerequisite for 
more than 90 percent of all state government jobs.78 

A number of coalitions are working to broaden opportunity for those without college degrees. 
A national campaign to “tear the paper ceiling,” sponsored by Opportunity@Work, aims to raise 
awareness among employers that talent can come from community colleges, workforce training, 
boot camps or certificate programs, military service, or on-the-job learning. Year Up offers high 
school graduates training, six-month paid corporate internships, and networking opportunities. 
The Rework America Alliance brings together employers, labor unions, community organizations, 
educators, and advocacy groups to expand opportunities for workers in lower-wage occupations 
to move into better jobs based on their skills and experience. One solution, still in the early 
stages, involves digital learning and employment records—a sort of digital microcredential that 
can document how an individual worker has acquired skills and also translate across companies 
and over time.79 

Remove barriers for women 
It took three full years for the number of working women in the United States to fully bounce back 
after the pandemic. What could be done to maintain their participation? 

 — Expand access to affordable, high-quality childcare. The lack of affordable childcare has 
long been a major issue for parents in the United States, and it came to a head during the 
pandemic.80 In a recent McKinsey survey, women cited childcare expenses or availability as 
the number one reason for voluntarily leaving the workforce.81 Coming out of the pandemic, 
more employers are adding childcare benefits, from on-site services to subsidies. But 
individual employers cannot solve this issue on a large enough scale to move the needle on 
women’s labor force participation. Efforts to secure federal funding for universal childcare 
have not come to fruition, but some individual cities and states are acting on their own.82

The US infrastructure law, which requires private companies receiving contracts to provide 
childcare for their workers, helps to address childcare gaps and increase the low share of 
construction workers who are women; this could provide a useful template. Demand for 
childcare is high, but childcare providers are among the lowest-paid workers in the US 
economy—a situation that prompted Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to comment that 
childcare is “a textbook example of a broken market.”83

 — Companies can reexamine hiring. Hiring managers may need to rid themselves of biases—
especially those against candidates who have gaps in their experience due to time taken for 
family responsibilities. In general, companies may need to be more open to hiring candidates 
with potential and training them on the job, especially when it comes to new technology skills.

 — Consider “returnship” programs. JPMorgan Chase, for example, has introduced a paid 

fellowship for women returning to the industry after time off. Companies with returnships and 
formal mentorship and sponsorship programs have managed to develop and retain talented 
women in addition to boosting their representation in the C-suite.84 

Overall, the United States could benefit from holistically considering how to boost women’s 
participation in the labor market.

Keep experienced older workers engaged
The end of this decade marks a demographic inflection point. By 2030, the entire baby boom 
generation will have passed age 65—meaning one in four Americans could be of retirement age.85 

As described in chapter 1, the pandemic prompted many older workers to retire early. But as 
pandemic-related health concerns ease and remote work becomes more accepted, this trend 
could reverse to some degree. More Americans will need to work longer to shore up their 
finances, given the decline of defined-benefit pension plans. In fact, in a recent Federal Reserve 
survey, only 40 percent of non-retired Americans reported that their retirement savings were on 
track, and a quarter reported having no retirement savings at all.86 In addition, Social Security is 
gradually raising the age for receiving full benefits. 

In a recent CNBC economic survey, 68 percent of people who retired during the pandemic 
said they would consider returning to work.87 The survey also found that retired respondents 
prioritized flexible hours even above pay. Businesses that need to retain experienced workers 
with hard-to-find skills may need to redesign work arrangements, perhaps focusing on 
mentoring younger coworkers. Unilever’s “U-Work” model aims to provide flexibility by offering 
varying intermittent assignments and allowing workers to do other things between assignments 
while receiving a monthly retainer and other tailored benefits. 

Helping people in low-wage, 
shrinking roles add the skills they 
need to move into growing jobs 
will require significant effort.

Businesses can team up with nonprofits and local economic development agencies to find and 
train experienced workers interested in “second acts.” AARP’s Back to Work 50+ program teams 
with community partners to help older workers train for positions that are in demand and update 
their job-hunting strategies.

Activate historically overlooked populations
Another way to increase inclusion in the labor force is by reducing barriers for often-overlooked 
populations. This is one area where companies can take the lead simply by revising their own 
hiring practices to take a broader perspective on candidates.

Remote work, for example, is opening up long-needed opportunities for people with disabilities, 
a notably underutilized pool of talent. Employment among this group is higher than before the 
pandemic.88 Continuing this trend could be pivotal for those with chronic conditions and those 
suffering from long COVID.

Residents of rural areas, too, can benefit from the shift to remote work. These areas have 
historically missed out on the kind of job growth enjoyed by large coastal cities, particularly when 
it comes to higher-paying and more knowledge-intensive jobs. But during the pandemic, many 
urban residents relocated to smaller towns while keeping their jobs and working online. Many 
companies no longer have to be constrained by geography in hiring—and there is a great deal of 
untapped talent to be found in small towns and rural areas. To make the most of this opportunity, 
local governments need to ensure that robust digital networks are in place. 

Other traditional hiring barriers could also be eliminated, such as biases against workers with 
employment gaps. Automated screening tools may be weeding out talented applicants with gaps 
and other anomalies on their résumés.89 

Similarly, some employers are revisiting the requirement that employees not have criminal 
records. Companies across sectors (including JPMorgan Chase and Amazon) are willing to 
consider some former offenders on a case-by-case basis.90 One organization focused on making 
reentry possible is Homeboy Industries. Every year, Homeboy takes hundreds of former gang 
members and formerly incarcerated people through an intensive 18-month employment program, 
giving them opportunities to add skills and work experience in social enterprises. Removing the 
stigma surrounding those who have served their time would create opportunities for people to 
redirect their lives and become contributing members of their communities.

American workers will need opportunities to 
acquire the skills that will be in demand
With millions of jobs potentially being eliminated by automation—and an even larger number 
being created in fields requiring different skills—the United States faces an immense challenge 
and a huge opportunity. Many initiatives are in place, but not necessarily at the scale that will be 
required for a smooth transition in the future. It will be critical to scale up what works and connect 
displaced workers with the resources they need to make successful career transitions. The 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, for example, includes programs focused on expanding access to 
broadband as well as digital skills training, classroom instruction, and on-the-job training in fields 
related to infrastructure and energy efficiency. Similarly, the CHIPS and Science Act will fund not 
only semiconductor manufacturing but also STEM workforce development.

Employers can make a meaningful difference in filling roles and solving job mismatches through 
new recruiting policies as well as paid internships, apprenticeships, and training programs so that

individuals can earn while they learn. It will take coalitions of employers, educational institutions, 
nonprofits, labor unions, and industry groups to tackle this challenge. 

 — Pre-college students. Initiatives in schools can prepare tomorrow’s workforce for the 
science, technology, healthcare, and engineering jobs of the future. These can include 
extracurricular activities and external competitions to encourage early engagement. For 
example, Million Girls Moonshot runs after-school activities and summer programs to inspire 
and prepare more girls to pursue studies and careers in STEM. 

 — College students. Many companies are teaming up with universities and community 

colleges to build highly targeted vocational pipelines and academic programs in areas of 
high demand.91 Educational institutions can shape curricula toward skills and growing local 
industries, while companies can offer hands-on experience and immediate employment after 
students complete their programs. With guidance from nonprofits and industry advisers, the 
City University of New York, for example, has been revising its curriculum in data analytics 
and cybersecurity to prepare students to better meet labor demand.92 Looking beyond 
individual programming choices, the United States also needs to tackle some broader 
structural issues, including access to education as well as rising costs and debt burdens. In 
addition, institutions need to do more to boost completion rates: only about 60 percent of 
students who start a four-year program obtain a bachelor’s degree, and about 30 percent of 
those who pursue a certificate or associate degree actually earn those credentials.93 

 — Unemployed individuals. Organizations can build out training programs and pathways 

to pull the unemployed into high-demand lines of work. For example, a nonprofit initiative 
called Generation, founded by organizations including McKinsey, targets unemployed youth 
worldwide. The program works with employers to identify the essential skills new employees 
need, then distills those skills into short-term four- to 12-week technical training courses, 
accompanied by mentorship and placement services with partnering employers.94 

 — Displaced workers. In the years ahead, millions of midcareer workers will need to leave 

declining occupations and enter new arenas. Workers will need to be adaptable and rise to 
the challenge of acquiring new skills. Companies can recruit from specific industries that 
are shrinking, particularly if they map out which skills are transferable, and hire and train 
people with potential. They can also invest in learning programs to help their own workers 
make internal transfers into growing roles. With labor in shorter supply, companies will not 
only need to attract new talent. They will also need to focus on retention by keeping current 
workers engaged. Some attrition is to be expected, but employers cannot afford excessive 
turnover and the loss of too much experience and institutional knowledge. Workers value 
flexibility and a positive experience with their managers and teams more than ever—and they 
are demanding more from their employers.

Retention will also matter more than ever. Employers can use what they learned from the 
pandemic to keep their workforces more engaged. In a McKinsey survey, employees cited not 
feeling valued by their organizations or their managers as primary reasons for quitting. Those 
who identified as non-White or multiracial were more likely than their White counterparts to say 
they had left companies because they didn’t feel they belonged. Employers have learned that 
employees want meaningful work, job flexibility and autonomy, connection, and opportunities 
to learn and advance. Part of keeping them involves removing toxic managers in favor of those 
who motivate and inspire; aligning benefits with employee priorities; strengthening the sense of 
community; and creating career paths and development opportunities.95 

Where it’s feasible, employers could consider hybrid work models as the rule and not the 
exception. This could include both work-from-home accommodations and flexible working hours. 
This is easier in occupations with clearer productivity measures. As the pandemic demonstrated, 
hybrid models help sustain productivity in the face of disruptive events; they can also help 
employees balance their work and personal lives. If flexibility is offered universally, but with 
some clear structures and policies in place, it can be a powerful source of employee satisfaction 
and loyalty.96 

Offering existing employees learning opportunities and a clear path toward moving into new roles 
can reduce attrition—a major cost and a perennial headache in industries such as hospitality and 
retail. Walmart’s Live Better U, for example, offers employees the chance to add skills for future 
roles (or even to stay in their current roles); this program covers the full cost of tuition and books 
for those pursuing college degrees.

Companies can also think more broadly about where their workforce is located. Rural and low-
growth areas have lagged behind the national average in employment growth and recovery. 
But remote work presents opportunities for non-urban areas to draw consumers and workers. 
Not only can rural areas thrive and become more attractive to workers, but they may invest 
in becoming centers for growing areas of demand such as warehousing and automation.97 
Some low-growth and rural areas have been offering financial incentives such as paying 
eligible workers to relocate. Other programs offer to reimburse moving expenses, provide free 
recreational services, or host coworking spaces. 

Some people look at the spread of automation with a sense of foreboding about what it will mean 
for livelihoods. The good news is that the United States will likely have more jobs in the future, 
and they will be higher-paying positions on average. But helping people in low-wage, shrinking 
roles add the skills they need to move into growing jobs will require significant effort. In addition, 
employers will need to redesign many jobs and make them more fulfilling, and workers will need 
to adapt as technology changes the nature of what they do.  

The US labor market is proving itself to be resilient, which bodes well for the nation’s ability to 
handle the churn and change that the next several years may bring. Employers feel a new sense 
of urgency, not only about their own workforce needs but also about what lies ahead for the US 
economy. This is a moment when smart policy can make a difference—and when companies can 
step up and lead in positioning people and communities for success.

Methodology brief

This research draws on a large body of MGI research on the future of work.98 Its foundational 
methodology, approach, and assumptions remain consistent with those reports, with some 
additions and refinements. In this report, our analysis focuses on 2022–30, and all the driver 
models have been updated accordingly. Additionally, we have updated two of our trends to 
incorporate developments that have gained momentum in the United States, as follows:

 — The push to achieve net-zero emissions: The United States has made a formal international 
commitment to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest. We 
examined the impact of this move on jobs using a scenario-based analysis drawing on the 
approach used by the Network for Greening the Financial System. We built on previous 
McKinsey research assessing the impact at a global level to analyze the specific implications 
for the United States, adding sectoral and occupational dimensions to the analysis.99 

This net-zero analysis assumes that current supply chain composition remains the same by 
2030. We consider the impact of the United States meeting its own emissions targets as well 
as its role in meeting global demand for products. Jobs gained and lost are allocated as per 
the occupational mix of 2022. We consider job losses and gains directly associated with the 
transition and do not include other macroeconomic forces like population and income growth. 
In addition to creating a scenario, we consulted other estimates of the net-zero transition’s 
impact on jobs by 2030. These range from job gains of 178,000 (Decarb America) and 
300,000 to 600,000 (Princeton Net-Zero America) to gains of 6.5 million (World Resources 
Institute 2035 estimate).100 Estimates vary depending on assumptions about productivity and 
the US role in the global energy market, plus whether direct and indirect impacts are included.

 — Infrastructure spending: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, signed in 2021, allocated 
$1.2 trillion in federal funding toward a variety of projects nationwide.101 To reflect the 
impact of additional spending on jobs creation mandated by the legislation, we updated our 
infrastructure driver by incorporating construction-sector value-added estimates inclusive of 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocations through 2030. 

We use the following data sources and methodology: 

 — Labor force data: The Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the US Census Bureau 
for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), is the primary data source for workforce statistics 
in this report. The CPS provides monthly data on detailed labor force variables, which are 
used here as reported at the source. The Census Bureau integrates updated population 
estimates into the CPS each January, but the historical estimates are not revised. We use 
the published unrevised estimates for purposes of comparison, while acknowledging the 
data limitations.

98  This research draws on the methodology and findings of multiple MGI reports: A future that works: Automation, employment, 

and productivity, January 2017; Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automation, November 2017; 
The future of work in America: People and places, today and tomorrow, July 2019; and The future of work after COVID‑19,

A note on terminology 

We use the term “occupational shifts” to mean declines in employment in specific 
occupations between 2019 and 2022. (We do not include gains in this calculation to avoid 
double counting.) 

Since the number of total workers grew over this period, losses in some occupations 
were offset or more than offset by gains in other occupations. We interpret these losses 
or declines that are offset by other gains as the effect of workers switching from one 
type of work to another. From the gross declines in each occupation, we also reduced a 
proportional share of total retirements. We calculated this by taking the number of total 
retirements from the BLS and allocating a share to each occupation according to its 
proportion of workers ages 65 and over. 

However, we do not know exactly how many individuals moved from one occupation 
to another or if they made multiple moves; for that reason, we refer to the number of 
occupational shifts that occurred during this period rather than specifying the number of 
workers making those changes. 

Much of our analysis looks at occupational categories, using BLS groupings. Each of 
those categories contains multiple occupations. A move from one occupation to another 
within the same category is counted as a shift (in historical context) or a transition (in the 
context of future projections). Within any given category, some individual occupations 
may experience declines while others increase. The results by category reflect their 
offsetting effects.

 — Baseline employment: We use Occupational Employment Statistics data for 2022 from the 
BLS to capture the occupational structure of the workforce across sectors. The numbers are 
then proportionately scaled to CPS total employment to enable the inclusion of farm and self-
employed workforce statistics. We apply annual growth rates from BLS 2021–31 projections 
to the 2022 baseline to estimate 2030 employment levels. 

 — Automation: To determine the potential impact of automation in the workplace, we use data 
published by the BLS and O*NET to break down some 850 occupations into about 2,100 
constituent activities. Each activity is matched to one or more of 18 capabilities to assess 
the potential for a known technology to handle this work. In addition to looking at what is 
possible, we also consider what is feasible by assessing the solution development timeline, 
the economics of adoption versus paying wages, and the time required for adoption and 
deployment. We use the scenario inclusive of the impact of generative AI.

 — Impact of automation on productivity: We used GDP per full-time employee (FTE) as the 
measure of productivity. We calculated automation output under different scenarios by 
multiplying the projected number of FTEs by the estimated automation adoption rate. To 
maintain consistency with other data sources, we made several additional assumptions. We 
considered only job activities that are available and well defined as of the date of this report. 
Also, to be conservative, we assumed automation has a labor substitution effect but no 
other performance gains. Finally, we created two scenarios: a pessimistic scenario in which 
labor displaced by automation rejoins the workforce at 2022 productivity levels, and a more 
optimistic scenario in which they rejoin at 2030 productivity levels, net of automation. In both 
scenarios, we have incorporated labor displaced rejoining in line with the expected 2030

64

occupational mix. We also assumed that additional output from automation will not decrease, 
even if the total number of FTEs declines as a result of demographic changes. Under the 
assumptions outlined above, we calculated the GDP impact of automation adoption by 
country as follows:

Additional GDP impact of automation = FTE impact of automation X productivity2022

The additional GDP impact of automation is then added to 2022 GDP to estimate the productivity 
impact of automation.

 — Long-term labor market trends: We estimate labor demand factoring in seven 

macroeconomic catalysts: rising incomes, healthcare and aging, technological innovation, 
infrastructure investment, education, the marketization of unpaid work, and the push to reach 
net-zero emissions across the economy. We capture direct and indirect jobs that could be 
created or lost from each catalyst by leveraging job multipliers from input-output tables.

 — Trends accelerated by COVID-19: We incorporated several broad trends accelerated by 
the pandemic that may influence labor demand and jobs in the economy through 2030, 
including increased remote work and virtual meetings and the shift to e-commerce and other 
virtual transactions. 

 — Skills demand and transitions: We look at 25 workforce skills that fall into five broad 

categories: physical and manual, basic cognitive, higher cognitive, social and emotional, and 
technological. The number of hours that workers spend performing specific work activities 
are then mapped to each skill. Since one-to-one mapping of skills and activities undercounts 
digital skills, we correct this by reallocating a portion of hours from activities requiring non-
technological skills to those requiring basic digital skills.
