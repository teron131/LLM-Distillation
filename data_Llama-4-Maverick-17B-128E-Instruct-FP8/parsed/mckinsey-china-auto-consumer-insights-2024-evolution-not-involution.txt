About the survey

In the fourth quarter of 2023, we surveyed 2,449 auto buyers in 19 major 
cities across China representing a range of demographic attributes, 
including first-tier, second-tier, third-tier, and fourth-tier cities, as 
well as North, Northeast, East, Central and South, Southwest, and 
Northwest China. The report divided respondents by age, gender, 
income, purchasing experience, and current vehicle type. Based on the 
decision-making process during car purchasing, this survey provides 
deep analysis of consumer attitudes, vehicle preferences, purchasing 
habits, driving experiences, and after-sales needs.

McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2024

Executive summary

The rapid development in electrification and smartification of the China auto industry 
is undeniably shaping and transforming the preferences of auto consumers in China. 
Reciprocally, the evolving preferences and behaviors of Chinese consumers are exerting a 
profound influence on the China auto industry, compelling it to embrace electrification and 
smartification with accelerating investments in these two areas. Such mutual influence is not 
only pivotal for the future of the Chinese auto industry but also poised to profoundly impact 
the technology development, business models, and competitive landscape of the global auto 
industry in the next five to ten years. 

To gain deeper insights into the evolving preferences of Chinese auto consumers, McKinsey 
recently conducted the latest round of its annual China Auto Consumer Survey. Based on the 
responses, we have identified the following six key findings. 

1.  Consumers are continuing the trend of trading up

The China auto market continues to introduce various competitive new models of smart 
EVs, gradually increasing the attractiveness to consumers and shifting their attention 
toward mid-and high-priced models. Meanwhile, escalating price competition’s impact 
on consumer decision making remains limited, with 80 percent of respondents indicating 
that price competition hasn’t accelerated their vehicle purchase decisions. 

2.  Perceptions of EV and ICE brands are diverging

Multinational OEMs no longer command premium prices, and their brand halos are almost 
gone, a trend especially evident in the EV industry. Meanwhile, owners of traditional 
premium MNC brands are switching to premium Chinese EV brands—a trend flowing 
almost entirely in one direction. 

3.  EV penetration is rising fast, with a hidden concern of charging anxiety 

EV consumers making purchasing decisions are increasingly considering the 
performance of the vehicles themselves, rather than regulatory incentives such as free 
license plates. Also, the acceptance of EVs by Chinese consumers has seen its first-ever 
decline as EV charging infrastructure is deployed slowly in some areas. The situation 
highlights the extreme importance of optimizing charging infrastructure to support the 
sustained development of the EV sector.

McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 20244.  Direct-to-consumers (DTC) model is winning consumer trusts, thanks to its high 

transparency across customer journey
Premium Chinese EV brands have adopted omnichannel direct-to-consumer (DTC) 
models, which have achieved remarkable customer satisfaction. Even in after-sales 
maintenance, where the previous year’s survey found a performance gap with traditional 
OEMs, premium Chinese EV brands are catching up.

5.  Autonomous driving (AD) enjoys great popularity, but chance of monetization is 

coming under pressure
Consumer demand for AD solutions continues to increase. However, the free-software 
strategy of top technology-oriented OEMs has made consumers less willing to pay for AD 
technologies. Among those willing to pay, the amount they are willing to pay has declined.

6.  Consumers are aware of low-carbon vehicles but less willing to pay a premium for 

them
Nearly 70 percent of Chinese consumers are aware of low-carbon vehicles and willing to 
pay extra for them, but both the willingness to pay and the amount they would pay have 
declined. 

We see the industry evolving, not involuting, under pressure. Guided by Chinese consumers, 
the EV sector’s growth at full speed is now an inevitable trend, and new consumer 
preferences and behaviors are emerging and developing. However, the fundamental 
commercial behaviors are constant: meet diverse consumer needs and create reasonable 
economic value.

McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2024The desire to trade up is boosting sales of premium vehicles

Over the past few years, more and more Chinese consumers have been upgrading their 
vehicles. As a result, the market share of premium models increased from 10 percent of 
passenger vehicles in 2016 to 23 percent in 2023 (Exhibit 1).

Exhibit 1
In China, the premium segment of passenger vehicles continues to post double-
digit growth in 2023

According to the results of our latest survey, Chinese consumers maintain a strong desire to  
upgrade in their next car purchase, particularly those whose existing car is priced below RMB 
200,000 (Exhibit 2). 

 — Most likely to trade up are those whose existing car is priced below RMB 100,000: more 

than 70 percent say they intend to trade up when they purchase their next car;

 — Over 50 percent of car owners whose existing car is priced at RMB 100,000 to RMB 

150,000 say they will trade up;

 — Nearly 50 percent of respondents whose existing car is priced at RMB 150,000 to RMB 

200,000 say they will do so;

 — For the price segment above RMB 200,000, the most common choice among consumers 
is to stay where they are. In that segment, premium smart-EV models with great value for 
money are continually being introduced to the market. These attract relevant consumer 
groups, inspiring their rational thinking instead of constantly pursuing models with a 
higher price.

In last year’s report1,  many consumers in each price segment said they planned to purchase 
their next car in a lower-price segment. However, in the latest survey, a much smaller share of 
respondents expressed the same intention (Exhibit 3). Among the car owners whose existing 
car is priced at RMB 150,000 or less, the share seeking a lower price decreased to zero from 
12 percent in 2022. In the segment of RMB 150,000 to RMB 400,000, the share of those 
intending to pay less dropped from about 20 percent in 2022 to about 2 percent in 2023. 

Exhibit 3
The share of consumers planning to downgrade is significantly lower in 2023 
than in 2022

Two factors seem likely to have contributed to the significant decrease of the share of those 
who tend to downgrade:

 — Consumers show relatively stronger enthusiasm and confidence for new-car purchases in 

the post-pandemic era. 

 — China auto makers continue to introduce highly competitive new models of smart EVs. 
In 2023, more than 40 new EV models were launched in the price segment above RMB 
200,000 alone, and almost all models were equipped with features such as comfort, 
infotainment functions, autonomous driving (AD), smart cockpit, and ultra-fast charging. 
As these new models’ attractiveness to consumers gradually increases, consumers shift 
their attention to models in higher-price segments or stay in the same price segment of 
their existing vehicle instead of seeking a lower-priced vehicle.

had a limited impact on stimulating consumption 

Competition based on price is gradually intensifying in the China auto market. With mind-
blowing high-tech functions (for example, city area navigation-on-autopilot, advanced 
smart voice assistant, electric suction doors, 800V architecture, ultra-fast charging, and air 
suspension) at attractive prices, the newly launched models keep refreshing consumers’ price 
perceptions. Did the intensifying price competition stimulate the desire to purchase a new 
car, or did it simply help create a group of consumers who want to wait on the sidelines?

Our survey asked consumers how the price competition has affected their decision about 
purchasing a new car. The responses suggest that that the impact was limited:

 — The largest share of consumers (64.1 percent) say they are neutral, meaning the price 

competition does not affect their purchase decision (Exhibit 4).

 — Another 16.4 percent say the impact is negative―that is, the price competition will 

inhibit or delay their purchase.

 — The remaining 19.4 percent express a positive impact, meaning the price competition has 

boosted or accelerated their purchase decisions.

Exhibit 4
Price competition has limited impact on consumers, with more than 80 percent 
of consumers report no positive role for price competition in their purchase 
decisions

points higher than the percentage reporting a negative impact. As a result, price competition 
appears to have stimulated the overall China car market, but only slightly. In addition, the 
segments reporting a neutral or negative impact total more than 80 percent of respondents, 
meaning most people surveyed observe no positive role of price competition in their purchase 
decisions. The evidence points to a limited overall impact of competing on price. 

The impact of price competition varies according to the price of respondents’ currently 
owned cars. In the low-price segment, more consumers cite a negative impact than a positive 
one, and in the middle-price segment, the difference between positive and negative impact is 
only 3.1 percentage points (Exhibit 5). The net impact (positive minus negative) is greatest for 
the price segment above RMB 300,000, at 4.4 percentage points. We interpret this to mean 
that consumers in the low and medium price segments, facing a stretch of price competition, 
are more likely to expect further aggressive price cuts, so they adopt a wait-and-see attitude. 
Consumers in the high-price segment have stronger purchasing power and can respond 
more positively to favorable prices.

diverged; their initial consideration set differs 
according to the brand or type of car they own

Competition in China’s passenger vehicle market is getting more and more intense. Several 
leading new EV brands are gaining considerable traction, while some weak, old brands are 
phased out. Over the past three years, 16 new brands have entered the auto sector, each with 
a market share greater than 0.1 percent. In the meantime, seven old brands have gradually 
vanished from the sight of consumers (Exhibit 6).

Exhibit 6
Competition in China passenger vehicle market is intensifying as new brands 
catch up and old brands are phased out

As significant changes take place in the brand landscape, how will consumer perceptions of 
individual brands evolve? Respondents’ answers to several survey questions shed some light 
on this question.

collect more information about each brand in that ICS, and then make purchase decisions. 
According to our previous surveys, a consumer’s ICS contains just a few brands—two to three 
on average—and the brand purchased, regardless of powertrain type, usually comes from 
their ICS (Exhibit 7). It is noteworthy that while the average number of brands in consumers’ 
ICS is roughly unchanged, the likelihood of the final purchase coming from that set of brands 
has increased considerably. In other words, consumers’ purchase decisions are getting more 
focused. OEMs can benefit from this trend by working more actively to put their brands into 
consumers’ ICS and capture a greater mindshare when consumers develop an intention to 
purchase a car.

Exhibit 7
Although # of optional brands increases, Chinese consumers continue to keep a 
shallow ICS (initial consideration set)

A more in-depth analysis of the data shows that ICS mixes vary for different groups of 
consumers. For example, consumers who purchased a mass brand vehicle over the past six 
months differ in their consideration of MNC versus Chinese mass brands (Exhibit 8):

Consumers in the mass brand segment show different consideration in ICS 
(initial consideration set)

 — Among respondents who purchased traditional mass MNC brands, traditional mass MNC 
brands appear in nearly 100 percent of respondents’ ICSs, but Chinese mass brands are 
present in only about 50 percent.

 — Among those who purchased traditional mass Chinese brands, the opposite holds: 

traditional mass MNC brands appear in only about 50 percent of respondents’ ICSs, 
whereas traditional mass Chinese brands appear in nearly 100 percent.

vehicle owners tends to be consistent with respondents’ highly divergent brand perceptions, 
including their awareness of Chinese and MNC brands (Exhibit 9):

 — For the respondents who own traditional mass MNC brands, the top five most recognized 

mass brands are all MNC brands. 

 — The owners of traditional mass Chinese brands include two Chinese brands in their 

choices of the top five most recognized mass brands. Also, they are much less likely to 
recognize top-ranking MNC brands than the owners of MNC mass brands are.

survey results collected from premium brand owners: 

 — Among respondents who purchased three major premium German brands, the 

appearance rate of these three brands in their ICS is nearly 100 percent for ICE vehicle 
owners and nearly 90 percent for EV owners (Exhibit 10). In contrast, few premium 
Chinese EV brands were in these consumers’ ICS: almost zero for ICE vehicle buyers and 
less than one-third for EV buyers. 

 — In contrast, consumers who purchased premium Chinese EV brands rarely include the 

three premium German brands (appearance rate of 14 percent). And for these owners, the 
ICS appearance rate of premium Chinese EV brands is 91 percent.

with their divergent brand perceptions (Exhibit 11): 

 — Respondents, when asked to identify the brands they consider “premium”, regardless of 
powertrain type, mention only traditional MNC brands known for their ICE vehicles. 

 — When asked to focus on premium EV brands, respondents most often mention three 

emerging EV brands (that is, brands that sell only EV models). The top position is occupied 
by an American EV brand, followed by two Chinese EV brands. The three premium German 
brands offering both EV and ICE vehicles rank fourth, fifth and seventh.

Exhibit 11
The huge difference in ICS-mix among different vehicle groups is caused by 
consumers’ diverging perceptions on premium between ICE vs. EV

Even the consumers who own a major premium German brand rank these three German 
brands behind the American EV brand and two Chinese EV brands (Exhibit 12).

Through further research, we found that selection criteria differ among owners of premium 
vehicles bearing different brands. Respondents who own premium Chinese EV indicate 
that they chose premium Chinese EV brands primarily because such brands wield technical 
advantages in AD, smart cockpit, and original EV platforms (Exhibit 13). 

Interestingly, when owners of traditional premium MNC EV were asked similar questions, 
they often identify a brand-related reason as the key consideration for their decision. Such 
responses includes a preference for the traditional premium MNC brands and a lack of 
confidence in premium Chinese EV brands (Exhibit 14).

…while the traditional premium EV buyers are triggered by branding effects

However, the traditional premium MNC brands cannot simply rely on favorable brand 
perceptions to stop the one-way churn of customers. Among our survey respondents who 
currently own a premium brand vehicle, have held the vehicle for more than three years, and 
plan to purchase a new one, we found that many traditional premium MNC brand owners 
are switching to premium Chinese EV (Exhibit 15). The trend mostly flows in one direction: 
24 percent of respondents who own any of the three premium German brands say their ICS 
contains at least one premium Chinese EV brand, but only 7 percent of premium Chinese EV 
owners say their ICS contains any of these three German brands. These responses suggest 
that, when purchasing their next car, owners of the German brands tend to be more interested 
in premium Chinese EV brands than premium Chinese EV owners are in the traditional 
premium MNC brands. Thus, the probability of a traditional premium MNC customer switching 
to a premium Chinese EV brand is likely to be much higher than the probability of premium 
Chinese EV owners switching to MNC brands.

Consumer perceptions of Chinese car brands have 
greatly improved, while the brand halo of traditional 
MNC OEMs is increasingly challenged

How did consumer perceptions toward different types of brands come to diverge? In our 
opinion, a critical factor has been the significant progress achieved by Chinese car brands 
in vehicle quality, energy consumption, smartification, and electrification in recent years. 
This has contributed not only to the divergent brand perceptions but also to the increasing 
favorable opinion of Chinese brands. To test this idea, we listed several brand attributes—
including traditional dimensions like quality, energy consumption, and safety, as well as 
emerging dimensions like smartification and electrification—and asked respondents to 
identify which of these attributes describe each brand. We observed the following patterns of 
responses: 

 — On traditional dimensions, such as energy consumption, driving pleasure, safety, and 

quality, Chinese brands are beginning to rank among the top five (Exhibit 16). For Chinese 
OEMs, this indicates significant progress over 2020, when no Chinese car brands were in 
the top five on these attributes. 

 — On new dimensions such as sense of technology, EV technology, AD, and smart cockpits, 
top-ranking brands are mostly Chinese players plus one American EV OEM (Exhibit 17). 
Traditional MNC brands rank low on the tally.

premium for MNC brands, and the proportion is increasing

When it comes to the willingness to pay a premium, Chinese consumers have been willing to 
pay extra money for MNC brands over Chinese ones. However, previous McKinsey China Auto 
Consumer Surveys found that the premium advantage of MNC brands is dissolving, and the 
latest survey continues this trend: 48 percent of respondents say they are reluctant to pay 
premiums for MNC brands, up from 43 percent in the previous survey (Exhibit 18). 

Exhibit 18
Chinese consumers are becoming increasingly reluctant to pay a price premium 
for MNC brands

A similar evolution trend is evident in the feedback from ICE and EV owners. The percentage 
of EV owners who say they are reluctant to pay a premium has reached 52 percent, up 
slightly from 51 percent in 2022. The percentage of ICE owners sharing the same attitude 
has increased significantly from 2022’s 39 percent to 46 percent in the latest survey. In the 
meantime, the signs of this trend can be seen in the evolution of the ICE market share: despite 
the absolute dominance of the ICE market by MNC brands, their market share has declined to 
69 percent, down from the previous year’s 71 percent.

for traditional premium MNC premium brands, and the percentage is higher than in the 
previous year’s report (Exhibit 19). Even for those who are willing to pay, the premium they are 
happy to pay is limited: only 3 percent of respondents say they can accept a premium of 20 
percent over the selling price of premium Chinese EV brands. 

Exhibit 19
A similar trend observed in the premium EV category as well: even among the 
group that willing to pay MNC higher price, the scale of acceptable premium is 
very limited

Brand is now a relatively unimportant consideration 
for EV consumers, but as EV technology 
matures, its importance may increase

As Exhibit 18 showed, EV owners have become more reluctant to pay premiums for MNC 
brands. The same tendency is also reflected in consumers’ key buying factors for vehicles 
with different powertrain types: for ICE consumers, brand prestige is the top consideration, 
whereas for EV consumers, brand ranks fifth in terms of importance (Exhibit 20).

buying factors for both EV and ICE owners, and the pattern continues in this survey. For some 
common attributes, such as static experience, dynamic experience, total cost of ownership 
(TCO), and after-sales quality, when brand and EV-specific factors (such as range, charging, 
and battery) are excluded from consideration, the importance of these attributes to ICE 
and EV owners is evident. This continues to support the view we previously stated: as EV 
technology matures and when all EV brands gradually offer similar performance in terms of 
range, charging, and battery, the importance of brand for EV consumers may become close to 
its importance for ICE consumers. 

We also found that if traditional MNC brands can close their technical gaps in smartification 
and electrification, with their strong brands they can rebuild remarkable performance in 
China. In this survey, the owners of premium Chinese EV brands say that if traditional MNC 
brands significantly improve their competitiveness on dimensions like smartification and 
launch new models with performance comparable to that of Chinese smart-EV brands on 
technical dimensions, a considerable portion (63 percent) of premium Chinese EV owners 
may consider buying a new model from these MNC incumbents (Exhibit 21).

EV penetration is rising 
fast, with a hidden concern 
of charging anxiety 

Key insights:

 — As EV technology matures, a growing number of consumers are considering 

purchase of an EV, primarily because of vehicle performance

 — Chinese consumers’ acceptance of EVs has declined for the first time. Although a 
temporary phenomenon, it still signals the great importance of improving charging 
infrastructure for the long-term, sustainable development of the EV sector in China

25

McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2024EV consumers are more likely to base purchase decisions on vehicle 
performance than to simply consider free license plate factor

China’s EV penetration continued to increase rapidly in 2023. The increase happened not 
only in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, but also in Tier 3 and Tier 4 (Exhibit 22). 

Exhibit 22
EV penetration is increasing rapidly in China across all city tiers

An essential reason for the continuous increase of EV penetration is consumers’ preference 
for the vehicles’ performance advantages. When identifying the reasons why they would 
consider buying an EV, respondents most often cited factors such as a low total cost of 
ownership (TCO) and smartification, which rank much higher than policy factors like ease 
of getting a free license plate (Exhibit 23). Since the 2021 survey, smartification has risen to 
become the second-highest-ranked reason, up from third in 2021 and 2022. Over the same 
period, ease of getting a license plate fell to seventh place in 2023, from fourth in 2021.

on consideration of TCO and charging

Plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) and range extended electric vehicles (REEV) scored 
remarkable sales in China’s EV market in the past few years, thanks to consumers’ 
preferences for such models. In our survey, most consumers considering an EV purchase say 
they include PHEV and REEV in their options, but the proportion doing so decreased from 85 
percent in 2022 to 71 percent in 2023 (Exhibit 24). 

Exhibit 24

models. Most of them cite factors related to charging and range: range anxiety for BEV on 
long trips (cited by 86 percent) and sufficient pure EV range range for daily use (81 percent). 
In addition, more than half cite price and cost factors: attractive price of PHEV/REEV being 
similar to that of ICE vehicles (61 percent), lower residual value of BEV (56 percent), and price 
of BEV too high (51 percent). 

Chinese consumers’ acceptance of EVs has declined for the first 
time. Although a temporary phenomenon, it still signals the 
great importance of improving charging infrastructure for the 
long-term, sustainable development of the EV sector in China

Chinese consumers with EV are more satisfied with their cars than ICE vehicle owners. The 
survey asked respondents to rate their satisfaction with various dimensions of driving their 
ICE car or EV. On almost all comparable dimensions, EV owners rate their experience higher 
than ICE owners do (Exhibit 25). Clearly, EV brands have laid a solid foundation for the further 
increase of EV penetration.

the launch of the China Auto Consumer Survey. The percentage of respondents who say they 
would consider purchasing an EV as their next car is 62 percent, versus 68 percent in 2022 
(Exhibit 26). The overall EV acceptance declined despite continued growth in EV acceptance 
among ICE and PHEV/REEV owners. Fully 22 percent of BEV owners say they will not 
consider buying another EV in their next purchase, far greater than the 3 percent who said so 
in the previous survey. 

Exhibit 26
For the first time, responses signal a drop in EV acceptance, mainly in the 
segment owning BEV

We drilled down to city-level data to look for the source of this apparent buyer’s regret. Our 
in-depth analysis suggested a connection to the quality of charging infrastructure (Exhibit 
27): 

 — The regret level of BEV owners—that is, the percentage saying their next car will be an ICE 
vehicle, with no EV under consideration—is 54 percent in Tier 3 and 4 cities, much higher 
than the 10 percent rate in Tier 1 and 2 cities.

 — To find the causes of regret, we looked at the dimensions of satisfaction with vehicle 
experience by city. Users’ charging experience stands out for the much greater 
dissatisfaction of owners in Tier 3 and 4 cities relative to those in Tier 1 and 2 cities. 
Based on this difference, we identify charging experience as the primary source of 
dissatisfaction associated with regret levels of BEV owners.

 — The variance in charging experience is consistent with trends in the construction of 

charging infrastructure. In relatively less developed areas, construction of new public 
chargers is trailing new EV sales volume: in 2023, 9.1 new EV were sold for every new 
public charger, versus 7.6 new EVs per new charger in 2020–22. In the cities of the more 
developed provinces, the similar ratio got improved.

Electrification is an irreversible trend in China. Although a temporary phenomenon, BEV 
owners’ declining EV consideration is still an important signal to the EV industry. To guarantee 
the long term, sustainable development of EV in China, more efforts are required to put to 
further improve and expand the EV charging network.

McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2024Consumers favor emerging car retail models

Emerging car retail models, such as online purchase and car stores in shopping malls, are 
booming. At the same time, respondents to our survey note areas of dissatisfaction with 
conventional dealership model. Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of respondents describe 
themselves as dissatisfied with the level of transparency in the traditional dealership model 
(Exhibit 28). 

Consumers seek transparency improvement in multiple areas, of which the following are the 
most desired:

 — End-to-end transparency in purchase, including all steps from order placement to 

delivery

 — Transparency in vehicle information (for example, online information browsing, test-drive 

reservations, and deposit payment) 

 — Transparency in vehicle experience (for example, longer test drive that lasts two weeks)

 — Transparency in end price, eliminating different prices at different stores or even different 

prices from different sales reps

 — Vehicle visibility (for example, building more stores in central business district (CBD) to 

make it more convenient for consumers to see the vehicle and have a test drive)

Exhibit 28

conventional dealership model and want greater transparency

than with the conventional dealership model

In the previous surveys, customer satisfaction was consistently better for the DTC model 
adopted by most premium Chinese EV brands than for the conventional dealership model 
used by ICE brands. In this survey, the pattern continues. Across pre-sales, sales, and post-
sales stages, customers express greater satisfaction with the DTC model:  

 — Pre-sales stage: Premium Chinese EV OEMs have achieved high customer satisfaction 
through DTC models that build clear advantages in key steps such as online information 
display and test drives. Moreover, although premium Chinese EV OEMs performed about 
the same as traditional brands in offline information display in 2022, they improved to gain 
an edge over conventional OEMs in 2023 (Exhibit  29).

about prices, financing options, and delivery process to consumers. This capability has 
substantially improved overall customer experience and delivered widespread consumer 
satisfaction.

customer satisfaction (Exhibit 31). These OEMs cultivate consumer satisfaction 
through online communities, continuous customer care, various owner events, and 
online marketplaces. These efforts fully demonstrate the importance of an end-to-end 
customer engagement system: OEMs not only need to focus on building better customer 
experience for pre-sales and sales stages, but also need to treat post-sales engagement 
as an important stage for maintaining and improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
Notably, although premium Chinese EV OEMs lag behind traditional OEMs in after-sales 
maintenance, the satisfaction gap between the two types of OEMs has shrunk. 

Exhibit 31
In the post-sales stage, premium Chinese EV brands continued to excel; even in 
maintenance, their gap with traditional brands is marginal

The survey results suggest that the DTC model has substantially boosted consumers’ overall 
purchase and driving experience by improving transparency across the purchase journey. 
OEMs and dealerships should try to match the example of premium Chinese EV brands 
through: speeding up efforts to build a comprehensive marketing system, focusing on 
improved transparency across the purchase journey to ensure consistent online and offline 
experience and building a full-life-cycle customer engagement system.

Autonomous driving (AD) 
enjoys great popularity, but 
chance of monetization is 
coming under pressure

Key insights:

 — Consumers are becoming increasingly interested in AD solutions

 — In the meantime, consumers influenced by the pricing strategies of leading OEMs 
are less willing to pay for AD solutions and have lowered the amount they will pay

 — Consumer willingness to pay for AD solutions in Tier 1 cities might become a 

barometer for measuring overall changes of consumer preferences concerning AD

37

McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2024Consumer interest in various AD functions has 
risen, but willingness to pay has fallen

The Chinese smart-EV market has seen rapid progress in advanced AD functions in the past 
year or two: for leading EV players, highway navigation on autopilot (NOA) has long been a 
standard specification, and even city NOA is being deployed at a fast pace. In the meantime, 
the OEMs involved in this progress are committed to leveraging a wide range of promotion 
channels (for example, livestreaming, short videos, and influencer test drives) to shape 
consumer perceptions of AD technologies. 

Previous McKinsey China Auto Consumer Surveys predicted that leading OEMs’ pricing 
strategy featuring one-off payment would eventually influence consumer perceptions of paid 
AD functions. The results of this survey support that prediction. Influenced by the aggressive 
pricing strategy of leading OEMs, more Chinese consumers are aware of the importance of 
autonomous driving, but their willingness to pay for such functions has declined. 

Compared with their views in 2022, Chinese consumers are now more interested in AD 
functions in different scenarios, including highway/city NOA and auto parking. In the 
meantime, the amount respondents say they are willing to pay separately for AD functions 
has declined by 8 percent (Exhibit 32). The pattern of responses to the payment question 
suggests the following conclusions: 

Exhibit 32
Consumers’ interest in AD (autonomous driving) has increased, but willingness 
to pay for it has declined, especially in Tier 1 cities

or a one-off optional package, and in this way, they have subtly exerted a huge influence 
on consumers’ willingness to pay.

 — Tier 1 cities are usually the earliest region for adoption of advanced AD technology. 

Consumers there are influenced most significantly to the free-software pricing strategy, 
hence a big drop in their willingness to pay.

The more developed a city is, the more inclined its consumers are 
to adopt simple and direct payment methods for AD functions

Advanced AD functions (eg, city NOA) are first adopted in Tier 1 cities, so the consumers there 
have greater awareness of these functions and more experience with using them. Educated 
subtly in the market, consumers in these cities are more willing to pay for AD functions as a 
one-off optional package, since it is the most direct and simple option (Exhibit 33). 

Exhibit 33
Consumers in higher-tier cities are more willing to adopt simple and direct 
payment methods for AD

In the meantime, given their limited experience with advanced autonomous driving, 
consumers in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities favor more cautious payment methods to avoid risks. 
However, with the gradual penetration of advanced AD technology in lower-tier cities, Tier 1 
consumers’ payment preferences may become a barometer reading the overall changes of

unwillingness to accept a usage-based payment, such as a fee per 100 kilometers.

The monetary amount that consumers are willing 
to pay for AD functions also is declining

As the willingness to pay declines, the amount consumers willing to pay also is generally 
declining (Exhibit 34). An exception is the significant increase in the amount of fee consumers 
say they will pay for a one-off optional AD package for urban ground roads. We believe 
this is primarily because leading OEMs are beginning to release city NOA with continuous 
promotion, thus raising consumer enthusiasm.

Companies have struggled to make advanced AD functions a separate revenue stream. Still, 
there has been deep and widespread penetration of autonomous driving in urban areas; for 
example, leading Chinese EV OEMs dominating the price segment above RMB 200,000 have 
all launched mature highway NOA and are rapidly implementing city NOA. Considering this 
and the ceaseless promotion by leading OEMs (as well as car owners), we expect Chinese 
consumers to develop a clear demand for advanced AD technology. For smart EVs at medium 
and high price points (for example, greater than RMB 200,000), advanced AD technology, 
including city NOA, will gradually become a must-have for consumers, resulting in great 
pressure on OEMs that have not progressed in AD technology.

Consumers are aware 
of low-carbon vehicles 
but less willing to pay 
a premium for them

Key insights:

 — A considerable proportion of Chinese consumers are aware of low-carbon vehicles 

and are willing to pay for them

 — However, the share of consumers willing to pay a premium for low-carbon vehicles 

and the amount of the premium they are willing to pay have declined

41

McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2024Many consumers are willing to pay a premium for low-
carbon vehicles, but the share willing to pay and the 
acceptable size of the premium have declined  

Consumer willingness to pay for low-carbon vehicles is critical for the penetration of 
low-carbon vehicles. According to our survey, nearly 70 percent of respondents say they 
are willing to pay premium for low-carbon vehicles (Exhibit 35). However, that share of 
respondents is slightly lower than in 2022. In the meantime, the average amount that 
consumers are willing to pay also has declined.

segments average lower amounts they are willing to pay for low-carbon vehicles. However, 
the high-income group maintains its willingness to pay the most (Exhibit 36).  

Exhibit 36
High-income individuals are willing to pay the largest premium for low-carbon 
vehicles

In general, given the decline in consumer willingness to pay for AD technologies with even 
tangible benefits, it is not surprising that consumers are also less likely to be willing to pay—
and are paying less—for low-carbon vehicles. In the long run, consumer willingness to pay for 
low-carbon vehicles depends on the public perception of decarbonization and a deepening 
sense of urgency.

The responses to the latest China Auto Consumer Survey, combined with analysis of industry 
trends, show an industry that has made tremendous strides but also is engaged in intense 
price competition. We might characterize the former as a healthy evolution and the latter 
as a risk of involution. The future of the China auto industry will be shaped by which force 
dominates the years ahead.

In China, “involution” has become a buzzword used to describe competition in various forms, 
especially intense competition. There is no doubt that China’s EV sector is experiencing 
intense competition in areas that include technology, configuration, and price. Thus, it seems 
that almost all new EV models are now experiencing involution. 

But is involution the most accurate way to characterize the China EV sector? Five to six 
years ago, almost all best-selling passenger BEV models in the China EV market were A00 
segment cars with poor specifications in exterior styling, range, charging speed, space, 
and infotainment system. Today, Chinese EV have made considerable progress: they 
now offer futuristic designs, their long ranges can gradually catch up with ICE vehicles, 
ultrafast charging has also become a reality, and their wheelbase can exceed three meters. 
Furthermore, they also boast a flat rear floor, spacious interior, smooth infotainment system, 
and advanced smart voice assistants. Convenient city NOA and autonomous valet parking 
(AVP) also are gradually becoming a reality. 

In our opinion, such remarkable growth of the China smart EV industry within just a few years 
should not be described as involution but as evolution.

Though evolution is a painful process, it is the only correct path
The Chinese smart-EV industry has scored remarkable progress in both technology and 
user experience. However, price competition and the resulting low (even negative) margins 
are plaguing almost all participants and have sparked a debate on whether this strategy is 
worthwhile. 

At a time when the entire industry is in turmoil, intense price competition may be a necessary 
alarm for the automotive industry, where the intensity of competition has long been low. 
Evolution has been proved, and will continue to be proved, to be a painful process, but it still is 
the correct path forward. 

Embrace evolution, embrace consumers
Analysis of the China Auto Consumer Survey over consecutive years has palpably 
demonstrated the evolution of consumers’ role in the automotive industry. Chinese car 
owners have evolved from passive users to active proposers of automotive products. The 
automotive industry is a sector serving individual consumers by nature. Faced with the 
evolution of consumers’ role, OEMs need greater evolution in response. 

44

McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2024Many Chinese OEMs, both emerging EV players and traditional players, are actively 
embracing the change. However, some traditional MNC players are still hesitant. Looking 
back, since it takes six years on average for a traditional MNC player to develop a brand-new 
model, the current underperformance is probably the result of  decision back in 2017—
perhaps, which resulted in slow product upgrades, unmet consumer needs, and a focus on 
sales volume rather than customer experience, and the like. Looking ahead, the determining 
moment for participation in the 2030 competitive landscape is now.

How can companies embrace evolution and consumers? Responses that have delivered 
results include shifts in the following areas: 

 — Product innovation. Shift from offering consumers existing products to developing 

products based on consumer needs.

 — Brand management. Shift from thinking some brands naturally deserve a high premium 

to stressing the importance of brands offering unique value to consumers. 

 — Customer touchpoints. Shift from thinking about factories, stores, and consumers 

in isolation to promoting efficient information circulation and management across the 
customer journey.

 — Organizational structure. Shift from departmental walls and functional silos to a highly 
efficient structure with greater agility, openness, and diversity, as well as an empowered 
frontline staff. 

Some OEMs have already made trailblazing efforts in these areas. As competition deepens 
in the China EV industry, we expect to see a growing number of OEMs embark on a journey of 
evolution to enhance their capabilities.

Wherever the path of evolution leads, the fundamental commercial behaviors remain 
unchanged: meeting diverse needs of consumers to gain reasonable economic value from 
such effort. No matter how stiff the competition, companies can benefit from focusing 
behaviors on the original mission of value creation. 

Guided by Chinese consumers, the EV sector’s growth at full speed is now an inevitable trend, 
and new consumer preferences and behaviors are in the making and evolving. We hope OEMs 
will set a resolution to be top players, stay focus in the EV sector, and evolve with the Chinese 
consumers to jointly author a new chapter of the industry’s epic development.
