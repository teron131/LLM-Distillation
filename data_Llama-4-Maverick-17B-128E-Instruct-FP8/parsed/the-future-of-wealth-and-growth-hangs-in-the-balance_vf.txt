The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact base to 
aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s companies 
and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, and functional 
knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are solely the responsibility 
of MGI directors and partners.

Our research is currently grouped into five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity: Creating and harnessing the world’s assets most productively

 — Resources of the world: Building, powering, and feeding the world sustainably

 — Human potential: Maximizing and achieving the potential of human talent

 — Global connections: Exploring how flows of goods, people, and ideas shape economies

 — Technologies and markets of the future: Discussing the next big arenas of value 

and competition

We aim for independent and fact-based research. None of our work is commissioned or funded 
by any business, government, or other institution; we share our results publicly free of charge; 
and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While we engage multiple distinguished 
external advisers to contribute to our work, the analyses presented in our publications are MGI’s 
alone, and any errors are our own.

Recent turbulence in the banking world comes against a backdrop of higher interest rates colliding with high 
leverage amid heightened geopolitical tensions. This is a major change in background conditions from the 
years of loose money and seemingly endless increases in wealth. 

Over the past two decades, the global balance sheet expanded much faster than GDP. Debt grew, as did 
asset prices. But productivity and economic output did not keep pace, and inequality rose (for more detail, 
see Box 1, “What is the global balance sheet?”).1 

By late 2022, instability in the global economy and the balance sheet had become apparent.2 In 2022 alone, 
households lost $8 trillion of wealth. 

The future of wealth and economic growth hangs in the balance. How long might stress in the financial 
system last? Is the world facing a major rebalancing in its balance sheet?3 How severe could the impact on 
real estate, equity, and debt become, and what might happen to deposits? What is the optimal course of 
action for stakeholders, from investors to financial institutions to policy makers?

The range of plausible long-term paths remains wide. Much depends on whether the world returns to an 
era of weak investment and a glut of savings, entailing slow GDP growth, low interest rates, and unabated 
expansion of the global balance sheet. On another path, stronger consumption and higher investment 
requirements for the net-zero transition, supply chain reconfiguration, or defense lead to persistently higher 
inflation and interest rates. What would the policy response be, and could strong tightening trigger an asset 
price correction and balance sheet reset? Or could productivity growth come to the rescue, generating 
higher rates of economic growth as capital is redirected toward productive investment opportunities?

In this paper, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) models four scenarios to capture the range of potential 
outcomes. We call them “return to past era,” “higher for longer,” “balance sheet reset,” and “productivity 
acceleration.” In the most desirable scenario by far, productivity accelerates so that economic growth 
catches up with the balance sheet, thereby combining fast GDP growth, rising wealth, and a healthier 
balance sheet. The three other scenarios are all far from ideal, each in its own way.

The stakes are high. The economic, banking, and investment landscape of the next ten years may look 
very different from that of the past 20 years. The differential impact of the scenarios on economic output 
is enormous, and the fallout for the balance sheet an order of magnitude larger still. MGI has developed a 
model for the economy and the balance sheet for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. 
A balance sheet reset in the United States would lower annual GDP growth by 1.7 percentage points, 
compared with an accelerated productivity scenario (Exhibit 1). Likewise, total household wealth would be 
$48 trillion lower in a reset scenario than in a productivity acceleration one.4 Beyond a potential decline 
in wealth, which would likely produce its own scarring effects, a reset with material asset price correction 
would also mean that many debt-financed assets end up underwater. This would amplify existing stress in 
the financial system. For this reason, decision makers need to pay close attention to balance sheet impact 
when making choices for economic policy.

The economic, banking, and 
investment landscape of the next 
ten years may look very different 
from that of the past 20 years. 

4  These numbers exclude the “return to past era” scenario in which the rise in wealth would be higher still but unsustainable in the long run.

What is the global balance sheet?

To construct a global balance sheet, MGI added up all real assets in the economy (for example, real estate, 
infrastructure, machinery, commodities, and intangibles) as well as all financial assets and liabilities (for instance, 
equity, debt, loans, deposits, pension assets, and liabilities).1 All sectors are included—households, government, 
and nonfinancial and financial corporations (Exhibit 2). All assets and liabilities are valued at market prices.2  
The global balance sheet has three components that interlock: (1) the financial sector: financial assets and 
liabilities held by financial institutions, which help intermediate those held by other sectors; (2) the financial 
system: financial assets and liabilities held by households, governments, and nonfinancial corporations, often 
used to finance real assets with capital or net worth held by other people or institutions; and (3) the real economy: 
real assets and the net worth resulting from creating those assets.3 

1  Countries included in MGI’s global balance sheet work are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Central and Eastern Europe (including 
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Slovenia), China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, 
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States. The global average is an extrapolation derived from a weighted average of 30 countries (based on GDP) that account for 
approximately 77 percent of global GDP.

wealth’ but slow economic growth

The past two decades stand in marked contrast to the post–World War II historical trajectory of global 
wealth (and debt) accumulation. Before the turn of the millennium, growth in global net worth largely  
tracked GDP growth. But then something unusual happened. Around the year 2000, with timing that varied 
by country, net worth, asset values, and debt began growing significantly faster than GDP (Exhibit 3).  
In contrast, productivity growth among G-7 countries has been sluggish, falling from 1.8 percent per year 
between 1980 and 2000 to 0.8 percent from 2000 to 2018.5

Exhibit 3

Between 2000 and 2021, asset price inflation created about $160 trillion in “paper wealth.” Valuations of 
assets like equity and real estate grew faster than real economic output.6 And each $1.00 in net investment 
generated $1.90 in net new debt. In aggregate, the global balance sheet grew 1.3 times faster than GDP. 
It quadrupled to reach $1.6 quintillion in assets, consisting of $610 trillion in real assets, $520 trillion in 
financial assets outside the financial sector, and $500 trillion within the financial sector. 

Balance sheet expansion accelerated during the pandemic as governments launched large-scale support 
for households and businesses affected by lockdowns.7 During 2020 and 2021, global wealth relative 
to GDP grew faster than in any other two-year period in the past 50 years. The creation of new debt 
accelerated to $3.40 for each $1.00 in net investment.

6  The resulting increase in capital deployed needed to generate a dollar of output—or decline in capital productivity—is mostly concentrated 
in real estate and declining real estate yields. Gross fixed capital formation in real terms has stayed broadly consistent with output growth.

By 2021, four types of assets made up 80 percent of the three interlocking global balance sheets (financial 
sector, financial balance sheet of nonfinancial sectors, and the real economy): real estate (27 percent), 
equity (21 percent), debt (20 percent), and currency and deposits (12 percent).8 All four have risen relative 
to GDP since 2000, including real estate by 33 percent more, equity by 100 percent more, and debt by 
90 percent more. Currency and deposits grew 124 percent faster than GDP. 

The broad pattern of growing asset value holds across economies, but with variations in timing and relative 
pace of growth across asset types.9 Taking the United States as an example, the four largest balance sheet 
items outgrew GDP by between 50 percent (real estate) and 200 percent (equity) at market values relative 
to 1995 values (Exhibit 4).10 In the United Kingdom, growth was faster still in real estate and debt, and slower 
in equity. In Germany, balance sheet expansion was less pronounced across asset classes. 

Exhibit 4

8  The remainder of the balance sheet includes other nonfinancial assets, such as mineral and energy reserves, intangibles, and equipment, 

9 

and other financial assets, such as monetary gold and special drawing rights.
In this analysis, definitions are as follows: equity is consolidated equity liabilities of nonfinancial and financial corporations; real estate 
is land, dwellings, and nonresidential buildings assets across sectors; debt is consolidated debt liabilities of nonfinancial corporations, 
households, and governments; bonds are short-term and long-term debt securities liabilities for all nonfinancial and financial corporations 
(corporate bonds) and government (government bonds); and currency and deposits are currency and deposit liabilities of financial 
institutions, including the central bank. All are measured at market value. 

10  For the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, due to the dot-com bubble, 1995 is a better reference point than 2000 for global 
analyses in this paper. In 2021, the contribution to the US balance sheet of these line items was: equity $52 trillion, real estate $58 trillion, 
bonds $38 trillion, and currency and deposits $25 trillion.

growth remained sluggish. For example, in the United States, forward-looking expectations for real interest 
rates steadily declined between 1995 and 2021. Low interest rates encouraged borrowing, lowering the cost 
of loans and bonds and spurring commercial banks to collect—and create—deposits. In highly simplified 
terms, an overhang of capital chased too few productive investment opportunities, and much of it flowed to 
real estate and equity, driving up prices. Debt rose faster than net investment, and paper wealth grew. 

In the rest of this section, we explore the drivers of balance sheet growth across the four asset classes.11

Falling real interest rates fueled the rise of real estate values 
The decline in real interest rates has played a remarkable role in driving real estate valuations (Exhibit 5). 
Investors could afford to pay more for a property with a given rent, and therefore value-to-rent multiples 
rose. The cost of equity for real estate also fell, amplifying the effect. This meant that the effective yield of 
real estate, or cap rates, dropped.12 

Despite this marked decline in yields, rents (including imputed rents on owner-occupied buildings) kept 
growing. The rent share of GDP expanded (in the United States) or declined (in the United Kingdom and 
Germany) modestly while growth in the number and quality of buildings trailed GDP growth by a wide 
margin.13 Scarcity of supply—particularly in superstar cities—played a role.14 Almost one-third of the global 
value of real estate is concentrated in those cities, where further densification faces political difficulties 
and prices have been high and rising over the past several decades. This trend has slowed over the past few 
years, and prices have gone up less in these cities than elsewhere as the pandemic increased work-from-
home arrangements and some people moved farther away from work.15

There are some country variations. In the United States, for example, the market value of real estate 
expanded 1.5 times faster than GDP from 1995 to 2021. While there was a significant correction after the 
global financial crisis, the rise quickly resumed. Declining real interest rates drove almost the entire increase. 

11  To quantify the relative importance of different drivers, MGI uses a class-specific discounted expected cash-flow model, varying parameters 
across our scenarios in a model-consistent way. This was then fitted to, and back-tested with, asset data in MGI’s global balance sheet 
database. See the appendix for more information on valuation methodology.

12  Cap rate is a term used in the real estate industry to describe net operating income relative to the value of a building. The widespread use in 
the industry of cap rates and cap rate projections is often based more on empirical observation and trends than scientifically backed, and 
this may have contributed to the evolution of price. See Donald MacKenzie, An engine, not a camera: How financial models shape markets, 
MIT Press, August 2008.

13  The stock of capital in buildings grew more slowly than GDP in real or constant currency terms. It did grow faster than GDP in nominal terms 
as construction costs escalated much faster than general inflation, and real estate including land grew faster still as land prices soared. 
MGI focused on the relationship in constant currency, as land price effects mostly reflect the changes in interest rates and capital included 
separately in this analysis, and escalation of construction costs affects new buildings only on the margin. Regardless of the chosen metric, 
the rent share of GDP overall, which combines capital stock growth and rent relative to capital stock, was remarkably constant, growing 
slowly in the United States and declining slowly in the United Kingdom and Germany. 

14  MGI’s 2018 analysis of superstars looked at 3,000 of the world’s largest cities and defined 50 of them as superstars. This group of 50 

accounted for 8 percent of global population but 21 percent of world GDP. Their average per capita GDP was 45 percent higher than that of 
peers in the same region and income group, and the gap has grown. The growth of superstar cities is fueled by gains in median labor income 
and wealth from real estate and investor income. See Superstars: The dynamics of firms, sectors, and cities leading the global economy, 
McKinsey Global Institute, October 2018; and Jo Constantz, “A $300,000 salary feels like $100,000 in the priciest US cities,” Bloomberg, 
April 15, 2023.

15  An MGI report on the effects of the pandemic and working from home on real estate is due to be published in mid-2023.

In the United Kingdom, real estate grew even more strongly relative to GDP than in the United States. 
Declines in the real estate cost of equity played a comparatively larger role. As investors felt prices could 
only go up, risk perceptions and the cost of equity declined sharply before the global financial crisis.  
After correcting upward as a result of that crisis, the cost of equity fell again.16 

Exhibit 5

16 

Interestingly, the cost of equity for real estate did not seem to alter much with changes in interest rates in any of the three countries. Broadly, 
investors take account of interest rate risk, moving risk premiums up when interest rates fall and vice versa. As a result, in the United States, 
for instance, the cost of real estate equity declined only a little during the “irrational exuberance” of the 2005–07 bubble, expanded with the 
bust, and declined again during a run-up in prices between 2020 and 2021.

early 2000s as a real estate bubble in eastern Germany following reunification corrected. As a result, the 
German real estate industry went through the global financial crisis relatively unscathed and then began to 
catch up rapidly as interest rates declined. 

Declining real interest rates drove growth in equities, and in the United States, increasing returns on 
capital also played an important role

Falling real interest rates boosted equity values across economies as future earnings were discounted at a 
lower rate. In both the United Kingdom and Germany, falling rates were responsible for all of the growth in 
equity values relative to GDP between 1995 and 2021. In the United States, they contributed about one-third 
of this growth (Exhibit 6).

earnings, which contributed two-thirds of the growth in equity values versus GDP. The earnings share 
of GDP rose by 80 percent from 1995 to 2021 to 12.3 percent—the highest share in a century (Exhibit 7). 
The earnings share grew despite the fact that the stock of corporate capital, as is common, closely 
tracked GDP.17

A number of factors contributed to this increase in earnings relative to GDP, as past MGI research shows.18 
One was company-level superstar effects, particularly in the digital economy.19 Others include rising 
automation and a decline in labor bargaining power in some sectors, including from globalization, offshoring, 
and shifts in production to less unionized states.20 Changes in corporate tax rates may also have played 
a role.

Yet investors do seem to build in an expectation for the earnings share to remain at today’s high levels and 
for long-term real interest rates to stay low, judging by current US equity valuations.21 

For each $1.00 of net new investment, $1.90 of new debt was created
With equity values climbing, debt rose sharply, too, and, with it, equivalent wealth for lenders and bond 
holders. By the end of 2021, in the United States, Japan, China, and all major European economies other 
than Germany, debt was not only higher relative to GDP than in 2000 but even increasing from the peak 
following the 2008 global financial crisis. In the United States the figure climbed from 2.5 to 2.8 times GDP, 
in the United Kingdom from 2.5 to 2.8, in Japan from 3.4 to 4.3, and in China from 1.6 to 2.7. In Germany,  
debt remained stable at about 2.0 times GDP.22 

Globally, for every $1.00 of net investment, $1.90 of additional debt was created.23 Much of this debt 
financed new purchases of existing assets. Rising real estate values and low interest rates meant that 
households could borrow more against existing homes. Rising equity values meant that corporates could 
use leverage to reduce their cost of capital, finance mergers and acquisitions, conduct share buybacks, or 
increase cash buffers. Governments also added debt, particularly in response to the global financial crisis 
and the pandemic. Interestingly, rising bond prices as interest rates declined played only a minor role driving 
the debt-to-GDP ratio, as the time range used is much longer than typical bond maturities.24 

Currency and deposits in commercial and central banks have expanded
Growth in deposits exceeded GDP growth in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. In the 
United States, the volume of currency and deposits in commercial and central banks expanded from 0.6 
times GDP in 1995 to 1.2 times GDP in 2021; it is now 80 percent higher relative to GDP than the average 
of the past century. In the United Kingdom deposits grew from 1.9 times GDP in 2000 to 3.5 times GDP in 
2021, and in Germany from 1.4 times GDP to 1.9 times GDP.

In the United States, the rise unfolded in three waves, with varying drivers. Loose mortgage lending before 
the global financial crisis in 2008 triggered the first wave. At the financial system level, every new loan 
requires a corresponding new deposit.25 A second wave came with quantitative easing and thus the creation 
of central bank (or “outside”) money in response to the crisis.26 Finally, a third wave occurred with another 
round of quantitative easing in response to the pandemic. Moreover, the support for households and firms 
during the COVID-19 pandemic led to excess saving as households spent less during lockdowns.27 

21  To value assets in our three classes, we use class-specific discounted expected cash flows, varying parameters across our scenarios in a 
model-consistent way. See Robin Greenwood and David Scharfstein, “The growth of finance,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, volume 
27, number 2, Spring 2013; and Jason Furman and Wilson Powell III, “A tight US labor market stays tight,” Peterson Institute for International 
Economics, September 2022. For a different approach, see Òscar Jordà et al., “The rate of return on everything, 1870–2015,” The Quarterly 
Journal of Economics, volume 134, issue 3, August 2019.

24  As a simplified intuition, in the very long run and at the total economy level, every bond is eventually held to maturity.
25  A new deposit is created with every new loan, and therefore new lending means new money creation and growing deposits at the financial 
system level. This is about the creation of so-called inside (or endogenous) money, as opposed to central-bank-controlled outside or high-
powered money. See Michael McLeay, Amar Radia, and Ryland Thomas, “Money creation in the modern economy,” Quarterly Bulletin, Bank 
of England, March 14, 2014.

26  The analysis includes central bank as well as other financial sector deposits.
27  Excess savings and pent-up demand were particularly high in the United States. Here, the less developed social security system meant 

that support measures (like the Paycheck Protection Program) could not be targeted precisely. See Jérémie Cohen-Setton and Jean Pisani 
Ferry, When more delivers less: Comparing the US and French COVID-19 crisis responses, Peterson Institute for International  
Economics, 2020.

Are the forces that 
propelled global balance 
sheet growth shifting?

Weak investment and excess saving have prevailed over the past several decades, underpinning expansion 
of the global balance sheet.28 There was a relative paucity of productive options for savers—retail as well 
as institutional—and the price of existing homes and shares duly rose. GDP growth remained below its 
structural potential. Central banks kept interest rates low to stimulate economic activity, aiming for their 
inflation targets.29 This was classic “secular stagnation.”30 

Might this be changing? Much in the world certainly seems to be shifting, from geopolitics to technology, 
energy systems, and demographics.31 It is possible that the more structural forces behind high savings and 
weak investment will themselves shift, although this remains a matter of uncertainty and debate. 

28  Ex post, savings—domestic and foreign capital inflows—and investment are arithmetically identical in an economy, balanced out by 

the interest rate but also by changes in GDP growth and the broader economic equilibrium, but this report uses the notions of “savings 
overhang” and “investment overhang” in an ex ante understanding. 

29  This may have entailed a drop in real interest rates beyond the effect of the savings overhang. See Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, and Phurichai 

Rungcharoenkitkul, What anchors for the natural rate of interest? BIS working papers number 777, March 2019.

Fund, March 2020; and Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams, “Measuring the natural rate of interest: International 
trends and determinants,” Journal of International Economics, volume 108, supplement 1, May 2017.

Will investment requirements and demand for capital grow after  
decades of decline? 
Over the past several decades, there has been too little productive investment. In advanced economies, 
net investment has declined as a share of GDP. In the 2010s, this ratio was roughly 50 percent lower than 
before the 2008 financial crisis in Europe, and 40 percent in the United States (Exhibit 8).32 Markedly, in 
the aftermath of the global financial crisis, private-sector investment plummeted in the face of uncertainty 
and weak demand outlooks.33 Capital deepening (growth in capital stock per worker) dropped to the lowest 
rate in the post–World War II period. Public investment has also lagged, including in infrastructure and 
affordable housing. In infrastructure, for example, past MGI analysis showed that the United States invested 
about 0.4 percent of GDP less than the estimated amount needed to support economic growth between 
2010 and 2020.34

Much in the world certainly seems 
to be shifting, from geopolitics to 
technology, energy systems, and 
demographics. It is possible that the 
more structural forces behind high 
savings and weak investment will 
themselves shift, although this remains 
a matter of uncertainty and debate. 

32  The sharpest decline occurred around the time of the global financial crisis, but net investment never fully recovered thereafter. Note that 

MGI looks at net investment here rather than the more common gross investment figure, because net investment corresponds to long-term 
capital stock buildup and creating long-term stores of value.

demand for capital—and its cost—could well rise substantially. Even if not all incremental investment is 
productive, economic growth could accelerate.

 — Infrastructure investment rises. Particularly in the United States, a shift appears to be emerging after 
decades of underinvestment in infrastructure. For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, 
signed into law in November 2021, provides for an incremental $550 billion in government spending 
focused on public transit, high-speed broadband, clean drinking water, and electric vehicle charging 
infrastructure.35 Higher infrastructure investment will accelerate productivity growth.

 — Energy transition gains momentum. MGI research suggests that the net-zero transition alone will need 
incremental investment equivalent to about two percentage points of GDP in the 2020s.36 This will likely 
initially dampen productivity growth at first but could accelerate it in the long run.37 

 — Intangible assets continue to grow. Investment in intangible assets, such as in digitization and R&D, 

has risen and will continue to rise steadily as they become structurally more important for the economy. 
However, two factors have limited the speed of this growth. First, the skills needed to deploy intangible 
assets have been in short supply. This could change with increased investment in skill building and 
deployment of easier-to-use AI technology. Second, intangible assets have struggled to serve as a 
vehicle for long-run savings. Because of their shorter life cycles, they can absorb savings only for a more 
limited period before becoming obsolete or passing value on to consumers as competition picks up. 
While regulation could limit such spillovers, this would be negative for growth.38 

 — Geopolitics drive a stepping up in investment related to defense, supply chains, and industrial 

policy. More fractured geopolitics may increase investment in supply chain reconfiguration, industrial 
policy initiatives, and defense—with mixed outcomes for productivity. New business investment is rising 
in areas like chips and clean tech, and supply chains are being reconfigured.39 Done well, this can lead 
to more resilient and still productive local economies, but it can also lead to less efficiency at a global 
scale. In the case of defense, European economies have tended to not invest in line with their NATO 
commitments, but in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they are stepping up. While some of these 
investments may generate productivity, especially at the national level, politically induced investments 
do generally face the risk of unproductive capital allocation.40

35  Updated fact sheet: Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, White House, August 2, 2021.
36  This includes spending across energy- and land-use systems such as power, mobility, and buildings, to name a few. It includes some 

categories of physical assets that are typically considered consumer durables, for example passenger cars. It also includes spending on 
both low-emissions assets (for example, renewable power) and some high-emissions assets (for example, internal combustion engine 
vehicles and gas-based power), which would continue, especially in the early years of the transition. See The net-zero transition: What it 
would cost, what it could bring, McKinsey Global Institute, January 2022; Global trade: The complication of concentration, McKinsey Global 
Institute, January 2023; and Toward a sustainable, inclusive, growing future: The role of business, McKinsey Global Institute,  
November 2022.

37  During the transition, many investments will not be commercially viable and will duplicate existing higher-emitting capital stock. But in 

the long run, many sectors will see productivity grow. To name just one example, electric vehicles require much less labor to produce and 
maintain than more complex internal combustion engine cars.

Are the forces behind the savings glut on the wane?
Three factors that drove a glut of savings in the past stand out. Each of them may be shifting: 

 — Rising inequality and declining labor share of income: Reversal under tight labor markets?  

For decades, inequality rose and the labor share of income declined.41 This has reduced consumption 
by channeling a disproportionate share of value creation to the wealthy, who tend to save more than the 
population overall.42 Rising saving by the wealthy has bid up prices for assets, particularly those with 
expected higher returns. At the same time, corporate earnings have grown rapidly, particularly in the 
United States, driving equity valuations and thus balance sheet growth further.

Some of the factors underpinning income inequality and declining labor shares may shift in the longer 
term, boosting consumption relative to savings. In the United States in recent years, the trajectory 
on both, labor share and inequality, has already become much flatter (again, see Exhibit 8). Workers’ 
bargaining power could rise if the labor market remains tight and unions regain influence, particularly 
in the United States.43 Superstar dynamics and globalization, which lifted incomes for all but not in the 
same way for everyone, are being exposed to changing domestic and global politics and rules.44 Talent 
shortages have boosted wages in general, particularly for higher-skill workers.45 At the same time, 
automation has undermined the wages of low- and medium-skill workers.46 The advent of generative AI 
may affect the wage premium for skills. For now, it is too soon to know where we are going. In 2022 and 
early 2023, wage growth did accelerate markedly, but in most economies it remained below inflation, 
and earnings have grown faster.47 

 — Aging: Shift from saving for retirement to spending in retirement? An aging population has 

consequences for an economy’s aggregate savings rate.48 The conventional view holds that households 
accumulate wealth to prepare for retirement and then run down savings in retirement. But, with some 
variation across countries, households have not been spending savings as much as the conventional 
argument suggests, rather keeping capital as precautionary savings and to be inherited by their 
offspring; this is the so-called retirement savings puzzle.49  

41  For a discussion of the drivers of labor share declines, see A new look at the declining labor share of income in the United States,

42  MGI research estimated that differences in the marginal propensity to consume between lower- and higher-income quintiles added about 
one percentage point of GDP to US savings between 2000 and 2014, and more recent research also highlights the strong influence of 
inequality on savings and interest rates. See Solving the productivity puzzle: The role of demand and the promise of digitization,

Papers on Economic Activity, Spring 2007.

49  This difference varies with national conditions. For instance, in a defined-benefits system, based on social security contributions (payroll 
taxes) to a pay-as-you-go system, there is less incentive to save. The capacity to save also differs across income strata, and differences 
across nations in inequality matter. See Charles Yuji Horioka and Luigi Ventura, “Do the retired elderly in Europe decumulate their wealth?

December 2022.

Do demographics therefore imply a continuous savings glut, or are we more likely to experience a  
“great reversal”? The mainstream view’s answer is that the savings surplus is set to continue for an 
extended period.50 But a minority position holds that the trend is about to break, that consumption 
expenditure (such as old-age healthcare costs) could rise substantially, and aggregate savings could 
fall.51 In addition, a rising dependency ratio means that the number of people dissaving in retirement 
relative to those saving during working life will grow (again, see Exhibit 8). Balance sheet expansion—
asset valuation effects—also may play a role. If retirees no longer benefit from the same rate of asset 
price appreciation as in past decades, they will have to consume more of their savings. 

 — Savings glut from net exporters: Retreating? Particularly after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, 

economies in the region built up large foreign reserves to self-insure as a buffer against future shocks, 
which repeatedly led to sudden stops in capital flows. Much of this pool of reserves was invested in 
US Treasuries, bidding up their prices, which is tantamount to lowering their yields.52 The stunning net 
exports of China, but also of other net exporters like Japan and oil-exporting countries, added to this 
trend. China’s foreign reserves peaked at nearly $4 trillion in 2014, of which more than $1 trillion was 
directly invested in US Treasuries. But those holdings have since declined. Amid rising geopolitical 
tensions, the future path remains to be seen.

Can supply respond?
If the balance between investment and savings does shift, headwinds from demographics and geopolitics 
may make it difficult to meet the demand generated. Global labor supply grew rapidly in recent decades, 
adding capacity to an economy with soft demand. In advanced economies, rising participation by women 
has so far compensated for a rising share of the population in retirement age. However, as the population 
continues to age, the relative number of working-age people will continue to fall.53 In addition, about 
60 million workers around the world ultimately serve North American demand, and about 50 million 
European demand.54 Geopolitical forces may affect these global flows and increase supply pressures locally. 

On the upside, technology promises to generate tailwinds for supply. Could they move the economy from 
productivity stagnation to more innovation in and diffusion of technology? Past decades were characterized 
by slow productivity growth across advanced economies.55 So far, digitization has not translated into 
increasing productivity growth. But this could change as adoption spreads and technologies such as 
artificial intelligence add new capabilities.56

Four scenarios cover the 
range of plausible economic 
outcomes to 2030

To provide a window into an uncertain future, MGI developed four scenarios for how the economy and 
the global balance sheet might evolve in the period to 2030 (Exhibit 9). They differ in how forcefully and 
persistently the balance of desired savings and investment described in the previous section will shift, and 
in choices about monetary and fiscal policy as well as productivity investments. Each scenario—return to 
past era, higher for longer, balance sheet reset, and productivity acceleration—includes a pathway to 2030 
for GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates, the aim being to explore the longer-term trajectory rather than 
to make short-term predictions for the next year or two (Exhibit 10).57 MGI built a quantitative scenario model 
for the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, but the characteristics are applicable more broadly. 

57  MGI applied a multiple-step approach to developing the macroeconomic scenarios. The first step was setting average and end-of-period 
growth, real interest rates, and inflation based on the fundamental characteristics defining the scenarios. Interest rates and inflation were 
calibrated using an adjusted Taylor rule that determines a typical policy rate given a certain rate of inflation. Next came overlaying the results 
of a general equilibrium model—created by McKinsey in collaboration with Oxford Economics—as well as data from historical reference 
periods to determine the shape of the curves in the shorter run. Finally, the results were fine-tuned in collaboration with economic experts 
and external forecasts. For shorter-term scenarios developed by McKinsey and Oxford Economics, see “2023, a testing year: Will the 
macro-scenario range widen or narrow?” McKinsey & Company, January 2023.

Box 2
Development of macroeconomic scenarios

MGI developed four scenarios that differ in how forceful and persistent shifts in savings and investment will be, as 
well as in what the societal and policy response will be. We then translated the four scenarios into macroeconomic 
pathways for GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates. Through these pathways, we aim to understand 
trajectories to 2030 rather than make short-term predictions over the next year or two. 

Each pathway is plausible; none were developed using extreme or low-probability assumptions, such as a 
material worsening of global tension leading to a broadening of global conflict, or a global collapse in financial 
systems—both of which would trigger a sharp increase in risk premiums and a massive decline in asset prices.1 

While each of the scenarios has historical analogies, there are also marked differences. 

 — Return to past era versus 2000–20. This scenario looks very similar to what the United States and other 

countries have experienced over the past ten to 20 years.

 — Higher for longer versus 1970s stagflation in the United States.2 Inflation is lower, at 4.0 percent per 

year versus 9.3 percent per year on average in the 1970s, thanks to stronger central bank action. The real 
market value of equity declines more slowly, at minus 2.0 versus minus 3.8 percent per year. Real estate 
performs less well, at minus 1.0 versus plus 3.4 percent per year total market value growth in real terms, as it 
is starting from a much higher level relative to GDP today than in the 1970s and because of a stronger interest 
rate response.

 — Balance sheet reset versus 2008 global financial crisis or Japan in the 1990s. As in the 2008 crisis, 
equity and real estate sharply correct. In this scenario, however, the structural drivers of savings versus 
investments point the other way, the natural rate of interest is higher, and monetary policy does not come to 
the rescue in the same way. As a result, the total market value of equity decreases by 4.0 percent per year in 
real terms through 2030 (compared with an increase of 3.2 percent per year over the period surrounding the 
global financial crisis).3 So does real estate in real terms (minus 4.0 percent per year in real terms, compared 
with minus 2.3 percent during the 2008 global financial crisis). This situation somewhat resembles Japan in 
the 1990s; total net worth relative to GDP contracted by 20 percent from 1990 to 2000 and was still down 
17 percent from its peak 30 years later, in 2021.

 — Productivity acceleration versus 1990s. This scenario somewhat resembles the period of very rapid 
productivity growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s as the development of PCs, software, and other 
technologies finally led to an acceleration in productivity growth, resolving the Solow Paradox.4 Real GDP 
growth accelerated by 1.1 percentage points (from 3.4 percent per year on average to 4.5 percent on average), 
compared with 0.9 percentage points in this scenario (from 2.2 percent per year on average to 3.0 percent on 
average). The real market value of equity grew faster, at 12.5 versus 4.0 percent per year in this scenario, as it 
started from less elevated levels. The real market value of real estate grew at 4.2 percent per year historically, 
compared with 1.0 percent per year in this scenario.

In the United States, current forecasts by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the US Federal Reserve 
appear to fall at about the midpoint of the four MGI pathways. The same applies to market-implied interest and 
inflation expectations. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, markets expect inflation to 
sharply decline in 2023, reaching about 4 percent, and eventually falling to 2.4 percent in 2030. The yield curve 
of US Treasuries suggests that markets expect the nominal central bank interest rates to come down gradually as 
inflation is subdued, reaching 3.3 percent by 2030. 

3  The period surrounding the global financial crisis is defined as 2005 to 2013.

productivity statistics.” See Solving the productivity puzzle: The role of demand and the promise of digitization, McKinsey Global Institute,

Return to past era scenario: Unsustainable balance sheet expansion at the  
expense of GDP growth
It remains possible that shocks will prove temporary, the structural overhang of savings will prevail,  
low interest rates will return, and balance sheet expansion will resume. At first blush, this scenario may 
appear attractive because wealth continues to grow. But that growth comes at the expense of real economic 
output, accentuates inequality, and continues to raise the risk of financial stress and future corrections  
(all numbers in this and the three other scenarios are for the United States).

 — What happens: Secular stagnation returns. In this scenario, inflation comes down over the next 

couple of years to well below 2 percent. Labor market tightness subsides, and unemployment settles 
at previous or slightly elevated rates. Demand is weak and mediocre GDP growth resumes, averaging 
roughly 1 percent between now and 2030. The earnings share of GDP continues to grow. Smart money 
chases opportunities in capital appreciation, such as real estate, rather than productive investment.  
Real interest rates turn slightly negative again. Capital is misallocated, and productivity growth 
remains low. 

 — Balance sheet outcomes: Continued expansion and vulnerability. The balance sheet continues its 
secular expansion relative to GDP, but, as before, remains vulnerable to future shocks and disruptions. 
The total market value of equity, adjusted for inflation, grows roughly in line with past rates as the 
tailwinds of strong earnings and low interest rates continue. The value of real estate continues to benefit 
from low interest rates. The total value of bonds grows as leveraging resumes. Only deposits modestly 
retreat as central banks reduce the size of their balance sheets. Real household wealth grows by a 
cumulative 28 percent, or $40 trillion on paper, with rising wealth inequality. 

The “return to past era” scenario 
may appear attractive, but growth 
comes at the expense of real economic 
output, accentuates inequality, and 
continues to raise the risk of financial 
stress and future corrections.

Higher for longer scenario: Using inflation to lower balance sheet vulnerabilities  
at the expense of price stability
If investment picks up and the savings glut wanes in a meaningful and persistent way despite headwinds 
impeding GDP growth, inflationary pressure may become entrenched. Then if policy tightening remains 
moderate due to financial stability risks, the economy may experience a higher for longer scenario.  
This scenario has parallels with 1970s stagflation in the United States, albeit with somewhat lower inflation 
(4 percent rather than 9 percent).59 While the lack of price stability in this scenario is problematic, it comes 
with solid income growth, positive (if not impressive) growth in wealth, and improved balance sheet stability. 

 — What happens: Persistently elevated inflation and rates. In this scenario, inflation settles at roughly 
4 percent as tight labor supply continues and the net-zero transition, supply chain reconfiguration, and 
national defense add two to three percentage points to the investment share of GDP. Nominal wages rise 
quickly, and consumption is strong. Policy rates rise in response but, with rising stress in the financial 
system, not by enough to bring inflation down to target. Strong demand and higher investment—even if 
not all of it is productive—support GDP growth somewhat above the recent trend. With bargaining power 
shifting in favor of workers and more forceful competition policy, corporate earnings grow more slowly 
than labor income and GDP. Risk premiums rise by one to two percentage points relative to averages 
over the past decade as volatility stays high. 

 — Balance sheet outcomes: Stagnation in real values and balance sheet contraction relative to GDP. 
The size of the balance sheet overall starts to revert toward historic averages relative to GDP, due to  
the combination of inflation and somewhat stronger GDP growth. As earning growth slows, the total 
market value of equity (adjusted for inflation) contracts in absolute terms and as a multiple of GDP.  
The market value of real estate falls in real terms as higher interest rates weigh more strongly for 
investors than inflation protection benefits and additional construction. Debt and deposits grow to 
finance higher investment, but more slowly than inflation; their ratios to GDP also decline.60  
Real household wealth contracts by a cumulative 8.5 percent or $12.6 trillion. 

While the lack of price stability in 
the “higher for longer scenario” is 
problematic, it comes with solid 
income growth, positive (if not 
impressive) growth in wealth, and 
improved balance sheet stability.

Balance sheet reset scenario: A drawn-out recession is the worst case for wealth,  
income, and financial stability
Tighter policy, perceptions of rising risk, and stress or even failures in financial systems could lead to a sharp 
correction in asset values as well as a prolonged recession and a period of deleveraging. Monetary and fiscal 
policy cannot come to the rescue as they did in the global financial crisis because balance sheets are already 
large. This scenario bears some resemblance to what happened in Japan in the 1990s.61 

 — What happens? A very hard landing and an almost-lost decade. Forceful monetary and fiscal 

tightening ends the bout of inflation. But higher real interest rates expose elevated debt levels and asset 
prices, which drop significantly. Financial institutions come under pressure with potential additional 
bank closures; value losses in bonds as well as in commercial and other real estate bite strongly into 
capital buffers. In the worst case, liquidity crunches force a fire sale of assets, further depressing values 
and triggering more systemic financial stress. Affected countries—and even the global economy—face 
debt restructuring or a drawn-out period of deleveraging. Uncertainty and risk premiums rise materially, 
and monetary and fiscal policy softens again to stabilize economic activity. Balance sheet adjustment 
drags down economic growth via deleveraging and thus weak demand as consumers pay back debt 
rather than spending. The supply side sees zombification of firms, banks, and assets, as well as capital 
starvation and weak investment. Deleveraging could last for a decade, and GDP growth would be one 
percentage point lower than in the previous decade. What makes the situation particularly difficult is 
that almost all sectors and countries are affected simultaneously at this stage, but deleveraging of one 
sector or country typically requires another one to add debt.62 Socializing the losses could accelerate 
the adjustment, but it is more difficult to achieve with already-high public debt and long central bank 
balance sheets.63 

 — Balance sheet outcomes: Asset correction and deleveraging. Overall, the size of the balance sheet 
corrects relative to GDP. The total market value of equity declines in real terms and as a multiple of 
GDP. Equities are negatively affected by a brief spike in real interest rates (but then supported as rates 
come down again), increased uncertainty and risk premiums, and muted GDP growth and earnings 
expectations. For instance, US equities and real estate values might drop by more than 30 percent 
between now and 2030. Real estate values fall in real terms and relative to GDP, driven primarily by 
higher rates as well as falling tolerance for risk. Bond premiums grow, and debt and deposits come under 
pressure from deleveraging, although the public sector is assumed to have to further grow its debt to 
stabilize the economy. Real household wealth declines by a cumulative 20 percent—as in the case of 
total net worth in Japan in 1990 to 2000—or $30 trillion by 2030.64 

61  For an account of that period, see Richard Koo, Balance sheet recession: Japan’s struggle with uncharted economics and its global 

implications, John Wiley & Sons, 2003. 

62  Alternatives are debt restructuring, or wealthy households consuming their savings so that indebted ones can pay off their debt.  

One example is the global financial crisis, in which households and financial institutions deleveraged on the back of the public sector’s 
growing its debt. Another is the large current account surpluses that Japan and Sweden generated after their respective real estate bubbles 
popped, to support domestic deleveraging. 

63  See Barry Eichengreen et al., In defense of public debt, Oxford University Press, 2021.
64 
In Japan, net worth was still down 17 percent from its peak 30 years later, in 2021.

Productivity acceleration scenario: The Goldilocks outcome; rapid 
GDP growth improves wealth and balance sheet health 
The scenario decision makers should strive toward is the one in which investment strengthens and is 
productive, accelerating productivity growth. This scenario somewhat resembles the period of very rapid 
productivity growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The balance sheet grows, but less quickly than GDP, 
and therefore is healthier and more sustainable. 

 — What happens? Productive investment and technology adoption step up to drive productivity. 
The forces outlined in the previous section lead to continued strong demand and an abundance of 
attractive investment opportunities. New investment materially accelerates productivity growth and 
GDP growth by one percentage point compared with the past decade. Faced with tight labor markets, 
firms accelerate investment in and adoption of digital and automation technology, fostering productivity 
growth. Reimagined supply chains remain efficient, and a new wave of emerging economies provides 
ample global labor. Industrial policy successfully drives innovation and technology. Fast supply growth 
moderates inflationary pressure. Inflation declines to target while real interest rates rise to about 
1 percent on average, further supporting productive capital allocation. 

 — Balance sheet outcomes: Sustainable growth. Thanks to rapid GDP growth, the size of the balance 
sheet overall as a multiple of GDP declines slightly. The total real market value of equity grows only 
modestly more slowly than in the past, but it declines relative to accelerating GDP. Faster economic 
growth nearly compensates for losing tailwinds from a growing earnings share of GDP and a slight 
headwind from rising real interest rates. The value of real estate (adjusted for inflation) broadly 
stagnates, and it therefore declines relative to GDP.65 The total value of bonds grows to finance higher 
investment despite headwinds from interest rates. In a stable economy, deposits shrink in real terms as 
central banks roll back their balance sheets with quantitative tightening. Real household wealth grows 
by a cumulative 11 percent or $16 trillion. 

The divergence of asset values and debt from GDP may end, 
reshaping the economic, banking, and investment landscape 
Decision makers have become used to a balance sheet, both debt and asset values, that outgrew GDP for 
decades, but the next decade could see the world heading in a materially different direction. In all but one 
scenario—the return to past era—current asset price and financial system volatility prove to be only the early 
signs of a fundamental shift in how the balance sheet grows relative to GDP. In three of the four scenarios, 
the balance sheet contracts relative to GDP, be it via asset correction and deleveraging, inflation higher than 
nominal asset and debt growth, or faster GDP growth (Exhibit 11). 

65  The sensitivity of real estate prices to real interest rates is much higher than for equity, and their sensitivity to GDP growth lower.

McKinsey Global Institute | The future of wealth and growth hangs in the balance

Exhibit 11

Growth in equity, real estate, bonds, and deposits looks markedly different than in the past two decades. 
For instance, during the past 20 years, the total market value of the equity of listed as well as unlisted 
companies has grown by 5 percent annually in real terms; in the period to 2030, rates vary between minus 
four percent in a balance sheet reset scenario and plus six percent in a return to past era scenario. (Note that 
these numbers represent total market value growth, not performance, nor price.)66 

There are similarities and variations depending on the country. Notably, equities decline less in Germany and 
the United Kingdom than in the United States in the higher for longer and balance sheet reset scenarios, 
largely reflecting the fact that they did not experience as large a run-up in corporate earnings. In real estate, 
Germany and the United Kingdom experience a smaller decline relative to GDP than the United States in 
the higher for longer and productivity acceleration scenarios as interest rates rise less amid somewhat 
slower growth.

66  Growth in the market value of all assets is not the same as performance. Volume effects such as new share issuances, new privately held 

firms, and newly built real estate drive part of the growth in total market values, but this does not result in higher prices for owners of assets 
today. MGI estimates that annual asset price growth could be roughly one to three percentage points lower than growth in total asset market 
values. However, asset performance includes annual yields, such as dividends or rents, which are not included in these calculations.

productivity, but preparing 
for less favorable outcomes

Decision makers will need to adjust their thinking to potentially a very different world economy and  
global balance sheet in the decade ahead, and indeed for an unusually wide range of potential outcomes. 
This calls for longer-term thinking, and a much broader set of indicators—including the global balance sheet 
itself—to be accounted for in strategy and planning than arguably they have been used to. Governments 
and corporations alike should collectively strive toward accelerated productivity growth, the only one of 
MGI’s modeled scenarios that achieves strong growth in income and wealth over the long term and a healthy 
global balance sheet. At the same time, however, they should actively prepare for less favorable outcomes. 

McKinsey Global Institute | The future of wealth and growth hangs in the balance

Striving toward higher productivity is vital 
Productivity growth and the choices made to achieve it are of preeminent importance in the current 
environment. Only an acceleration of productivity growth can underpin economic growth in the long 
term—and a healthy, sustainable global balance sheet. The situation has become much more urgent and 
important. Typically, policies to drive productivity achieve a few tens of basis points of additional economic 
growth. Now, the difference in household wealth between a productivity acceleration and a balance sheet 
reset scenario amounts to $48 trillion in the United States alone. Monetary and fiscal policy makers face a 
predicament: fail to tighten enough, and inflation stays uncomfortably high; tighten too much, and wealth 
and the financial system face stress. Without faster GDP growth, the line between these outcomes may be 
very thin. 

What is needed to achieve a productivity acceleration scenario? First and foremost, it requires productive 
capital allocation and investment as well as more rapid adoption of digital tools, MGI research has shown 
(see the appendix for more detail on actions to drive productivity growth).67 Reshaping the financial system 
to focus capital allocation toward new, productive capital formation could also help. What could shift the 
relative attractiveness of financing new businesses and projects in energy or infrastructure versus financing 
existing asset transactions like mortgages for existing homes at ever-rising prices or leveraged buyouts? 

Moving toward higher productivity growth also requires decision makers to believe that it is achievable and 
to translate it into a credible outlook. If firms prepare for a slowdown in GDP growth or a recession, they are 
less likely to invest. Instead, waiting becomes attractive. Real estate developers, for instance, expecting 
lower prices, will delay developing new projects. Banks focused on strengthening their balance sheets will 
tighten lending standards, reducing the production of loans. All this might set the scene for a self-fulfilling 
prophecy of doom and gloom. Leadership from both public and private sectors will need to articulate the 
basis for the acceleration scenario in order to make it happen.

Only an acceleration of productivity 
growth can underpin economic growth 
in the long term—and a healthy, 
sustainable global balance sheet.

Firms will need to develop strategies to get ahead of a broad range of  
long-term outcomes 
Since uncertainty may persist for at least some time, firms will need to plan for multiple scenarios.  
Past strategies may work well in a return to past era. Yet the other possibilities, and particularly the higher 
for longer and balance sheet reset scenarios, involve ruptures that arguably need a material shift in thinking, 
particularly among investors and financial institutions. Reacting to shifts in the macro environment will 
no longer suffice. Firms should identify markers for which scenario the world is headed toward, plan for a 
sufficiently broad set of scenarios, and test risk management approaches, as well as adjusting business 
models and seeking new growth opportunities.

 — Identify markers for which scenario the world is headed toward. Many players still emphasize 

short-term financial indicators such as the latest inflation readings, an interest rate decision by the US 
Federal Reserve or Bank of Japan, and the reaction to any of these in the financial markets. Longer-term 
structural shifts generally attract less attention. 

Given today’s high uncertainty and structural forces shaping possible futures, decision makers need 
to look further ahead.68 This means tracking indicators on the factors that might drive investment and 
savings, which are now shifting. They should also look at long-run drivers of supply and productivity 
growth, as well as the political and economic constraints that may shape the trajectory of fiscal and 
monetary policy (for more detail on potential markers, see the appendix).

 — Plan for a sufficiently broad and long-term set of scenarios. What consequences would business 
bear, for instance, if interest rates and inflation stayed high for a decade or, in contrast, if GDP growth 
were to materially accelerate? To provide some examples: 

•  How can investors and asset managers develop foresight and adjust asset portfolios? “Everything will 
be fine if you take a ten-year perspective” may apply less than in the past, whether for asset prices, 
financing conditions, or economic parameters. The scenarios have significantly different outcomes 
for different asset classes, and these need to be accounted for. For instance, in a higher for longer 
scenario, asset managers will want to contemplate reducing their relative weighting of growth equity 
funds. In several scenarios, cap rates would rise and stay higher, affecting investment cases for real 
estate developers.69 

•  How can banks rethink deposit models and secure liquidity and longer-term funding in the transition 
to a new interest rate regime? In several scenarios, deposits will fall at a systemic level, not only for 
individual banks.

 — Test and strengthen risk management approaches. This might include bolstering equity buffers, 

strengthening balance sheets, or offloading macro risk. Stress-testing business models and balance 
sheets to these scenarios—or reverse stress-testing which parameters and thresholds would expose the 
largest vulnerabilities—should be a priority.

 — Adjust business models and seek new growth opportunities. A sustained shift in the macro 
environment can make some business models partially obsolete and others newly attractive.  
To provide some examples for the questions that may be asked: 

•  For investors, how to prioritize opportunities to capture value creation, including earnings and 

rent growth in scenarios where multiples no longer expand? Even with market headwinds, there 
will, of course, be opportunities in individual investments, from neighborhood redevelopment in 
postpandemic real estate to new business models in corporations. And in any case, increasing fiscal 
support, with rising investment in defense, energy, automation, and AI, could be available.

•  For financial institutions, how to restructure business models that often are still hardwired into an 
expanding balance sheet, abundant liquidity, and substantial maturity transformation of liabilities? 
What sources of revenue beyond net interest income could be most promising across scenarios? 
Examples for fee-based income include payments, advisory transaction pricing and facilitation, 
the origination and financing of new capital projects, and ecosystem services such as real estate 
brokerage and moving services. Mortgages (even more so in commercial real estate) and Lombard 
loans may require a critical reappraisal.

•  For banks, how to anticipate substantial shifts of product, customer segment, and geographic 

attractiveness? Increasing the speed of capital and business reallocation could pay off and capture 
money in motion ahead of competitors. In a higher for longer scenario, for instance, lower- and middle-
income and -wealth quintiles could make up some of the ground they lost to higher-income and wealth 
quintiles. M&A opportunities will abound.

The turbulence of recent times is a shock to the system after a period of relative calm for the global economy 
and uninterrupted decades of rising wealth (and debt) on paper. The path ahead is highly uncertain, 
the range of possible scenarios unusually wide. The situation demands that assumptions be revisited 
and planning, strategy, and business models adjusted. The adjustment from what went before may well 
be prolonged.

MGI’s approach to decomposing drivers of market value growth in equity,  
real estate, bonds, and deposits 
To value assets, MGI used class-specific, discounted expected cash flows, varying parameters across the 
scenarios in a model-consistent way. This approach takes account of changes in the quantity of bonds, 
stocks, and buildings; changes in cash flows or income generated from them; and changes in how the cash 
flows are valued or the multiples of value applied to income. In simplified terms, this multiple is the inverse of 
the discount rate, or of the weighted average cost of capital minus the rate of growth. The exact approach 
varies by asset type, as follows: 

 — Real estate. The factors used in the model are the total rent income for owners (determined by rent as 
a share of GDP, including imputed rent for owner-occupied buildings, and the net operating margin); 
rent growth expectations (estimated via market-implied inflation expectations and rent growth above 
inflation from historical data); and the cost of capital (50 percent real estate cost of debt per the risk-free 
long-term rate and the mortgage spread, and 50 percent the real estate cost of equity). 

 — Equities. The factors used are total corporate earnings (after interest, depreciation, and tax) as a share 
of GDP, generated by unlisted as well as listed firms; earnings growth expectations (estimated via 
market-implied inflation expectations, real GDP growth, and expected earnings growth above inflation 
and GDP growth); and the cost of capital (determined by the risk-free long-term interest rate and the 
equity market risk premium). 

 — Corporate and government bonds. The factors used are the par value of corporate and government 

bonds relative to GDP and the yield to maturity (as determined by the coupon rate, maturity, and the risk 
premium as well as expectations on real interest rates and inflation). Interestingly, while there can be 
substantial swings in bond values when interest rates change, when looking at long periods well beyond 
average maturities, the impact from interest rate changes becomes less important. 

 — Currency and deposits. The change in total stock of deposits relative to GDP is linked to interest rates, 
lending, and monetary policy (that is, the provision of bank reserves by central banks).70 As there is no 
valuation effect, we have not built a model to decompose drivers.

MGI’s approach to modeling expansion or contraction of asset values  
relative to GDP
MGI built a scenario model to understand the evolution of the global balance sheet and project the total 
economy market value of all nonfinancial corporate equity (unlisted and listed), real estate, bonds, and 
currency and deposits. This model accounts for volume and valuation effects.

On the volume side, the stock of corporate capital as well as the stock of real estate (price adjusted)  
have grown slightly more slowly than GDP; this analysis assumes that the same relationship holds. 
Depending on the scenario, an increase in the investment rate of GDP is added. For bonds, a baseline 
of growth with GDP is assumed and is then adjusted by scenario based on the investment, inflation, and 
leveraging or deleveraging environment. For currency and deposits, steady growth with GDP as a baseline 
is used and is adjusted for scenario-specific monetary policy environments. As currency and deposits are 
currently at very elevated levels compared with historical averages, in most cases that means a contraction. 
The main reason for that is less provision of bank reserves or quantitative tightening.

On the valuation side, the same asset pricing models, calibrated for the historical decomposition of drivers 
of value growth, are applied. Growth, inflation, and interest rate parameters are applied from the macro 
model. For earnings relative to GDP, continued growth, stagnation, or partial mean reversion to historic 
averages are assumed, depending on the scenario. The rent share of GDP has been relatively constant

historically. Some variations are assumed depending mostly on consumer purchasing power by scenario 
in the future. The development of equity risk premiums has historically evolved in a relatively narrow band, 
with obvious deviations during episodes of boom and bust. The average of the previous era was applied in 
most scenarios, with an increase in risk premiums in the balance sheet reset scenario and, to a lesser extent, 
in the higher for longer scenario. Real estate risk premiums have been highly volatile, but the total cost of 
equity has been fairly flat outside of boom and bust periods. For this reason, in this case, too, averages for 
the cost of equity in the previous era are applied. There is an uptick in the cost of equity in the balance sheet 
reset scenario.

The results of the modeling are shown in Exhibits A1 and A2. The primary swing factors are GDP growth,  
the earnings share of GDP, real interest rates, and risk premiums.

 — Investment acceleration and productivity impact. Are net-zero commitments accelerating and being 
followed through with real investment in a long-run, affordable way? Is defense spending picking up 
materially? Are supply chains shifting in resilient but still efficient ways or in more politically driven ones 
that add mercantilism to national security concerns and result in duplication and inefficiencies? 

 — Inequality, wage, and profit dynamics. Are wages in lower quintiles rising notably faster than in the 
top quintile in the case that labor bargaining power recovers consistently and increases? Are political 
and regulatory approaches to competition policy, pricing (or market power), and taxation becoming 
more robust?

 — Aging dynamics. Are retirement ages rising faster than life expectancy or the other way round?  

Are retirees continuing to save the way they did in past decades, or are diminished asset price gains 
forcing them to exhaust savings more rapidly? Will they save more to prevent this?

 — Global capital flows and supply chains. Is there continued openness to trade in sectors where there 
are no national security concerns or a lasting shift toward protecting domestic producers? How are 
cross-border capital flows shifting?

 — Monetary and fiscal policy and financial stress. Will central bankers remain committed to fighting 

inflation if significant financial stress is looming? Will the public and its elected leaders accept elevated 
inflation or financial stress and asset losses? Which institutions would become insolvent if they needed 
to recognize losses on (commercial) real estate or long-dated bonds as well as long-duration loans 
(“mark to market”), and how much do they matter for the broader financial system and for doom-loop 
effects for asset prices if they are forced to sell under stress?

Levers that drive productivity growth
What drives productivity growth has been discussed extensively in past MGI research. Priorities could 
include the following: 

 — Enable more rapid digitization. Policy makers would do well to pay particular attention to doing 

what they can to enable accelerated diffusion of technology. By doing so, more firms could reap the 
full benefits of automated business processes and customer interaction, artificial intelligence, new 
materials, and so on. This could add a full percentage point to productivity and GDP growth.71 

 — Drive productive investment, including in skills. Priorities could include public investment in areas 
from infrastructure to basic research to education and skills; overhauling land markets to support 
affordable housing development; and setting the conditions for investment related to the net-zero 
transition to pick up.72 It will be important to ensure that industrial policies—that is, investment launched 
and supported by the public sector, such as the US Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science 
Act—add to innovation and productivity.

 — Transform public-sector productivity. In the public sector, from education to healthcare, there are 
ample productivity opportunities. Tackling those could be a big win, particularly in the aftermath of 
considerable expansion in the public sector and stress on public services as the result of a wave of 
government intervention and increased healthcare demands during the pandemic.73 

 — Initiate structural reform to drive productivity in the private sector. Smart regulation is particularly 

important. Regulation, addressing externalities, is often necessary and desirable, yet too much 
bureaucracy, complexity, and red tape can be as harmful as uncertainty and a lack of clarity about what 
the rules will be. Each sector has specific step-up opportunities, including expanded adoption of digital 
technologies, such as online retail, electric and autonomous mobility, smart grids, and industrialized 
construction. It will be critical to hasten progress.

 — Maintain openness to trade. Considerations related to strategic autonomy are arguably leading to a 
shift in the patterns of global cross-border flows, and this may continue.74 The search is under way for 
a new balance between national security concerns and cost-efficient production. Cutting through the 
value chain comes, inevitably, with lost opportunities.75 Yet it is important to keep in mind that the most 
resilient systems are not the most local ones, but the most diverse ones.76 The Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development has found that a “localized regime” in which trade was 18 percent lower 
would result in the level of global GDP being 6 percent lower.77
