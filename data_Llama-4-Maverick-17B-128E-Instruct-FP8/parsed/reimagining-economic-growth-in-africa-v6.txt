The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact base to 
aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s companies 
and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, and functional 
knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are solely the responsibility 
of MGI directors and partners.

Our research is currently grouped into five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity: Creating and harnessing the world’s assets most productively

 — Resources of the world: Building, powering, and feeding the world sustainably

 — Human potential: Maximizing and achieving the potential of human talent

 — Global connections: Exploring how flows of goods, people, and ideas shape economies

 — Technologies and markets of the future: Discussing the next big arenas of value 

and competition

We aim for independent and fact-based research. None of our work is commissioned or funded 
by any business, government, or other institution; we share our results publicly free of charge; 
and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While we engage multiple distinguished 
external advisers to contribute to our work, the analyses presented in our publications are MGI’s 
alone, and any errors are our own.

At a glance

 —  Despite a promising start to the millennium, 
Africa’s long-term economic growth has 
been slow. The continent is home to the world’s 
youngest and fastest-growing population, but 
its economic performance has lagged behind. 
Since 1990, its GDP per capita has grown just 
1 percent annually, compared with 5 percent 
in India and 8 percent in China. The 2000–10 
decade saw an acceleration across much of the 
continent, but growth retreated in 2010–19. 

 — Africa is the fastest-urbanizing place on 
earth, with more than 500 million people 
likely to leave the countryside between now 
and 2040. Most will move to the continent’s 
largest cities, increasing the need for better 
infrastructure and more productive jobs 
to enable these migrants to thrive. Similar 
investment in smaller second cities could take 
the pressure off their larger cousins, spreading 
rising productivity and incomes more broadly. 

 — Productivity across all sectors of the African 
economy is lower than in comparable regions 
of the world. Despite a fundamental shift to 
services, Africa could add $1.4 trillion to its 
economy, almost doubling the value added by 
services today, were it to match the productivity 
growth of Asia’s strongest services. Rekindling 
industrialization and increasing intracontinental 
trade will be crucial complements, together 
with boosting agricultural productivity to 
ensure the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of 
African farmers. 

 — Yet there is no “one Africa”—nearly half of 

its people live in countries where economies 
have grown consistently over the past 
20 years. Annual GDP growth in these primarily 
midsize economies in East and West Africa 
has averaged more than 4 percent. The rest 
of the population lives in countries with slower 
growth, including the continent’s three largest 
economies, Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa. 

 — In Africa today, at least 345 companies have 
annual revenues of more than $1 billion. 
Their growth and performance are mixed, with 
some fast-growing stars and some shrinking 
laggards. By 2030, more than half of these 
companies could increase their collective 
annual revenues of $1 trillion by more than 
$550 billion by accessing new markets and 
increasing productivity.

 — Africa can reignite growth through improved 

productivity, drawing on insights from 
existing successes across its diverse 
countries, cities, and companies. Accelerating 
digitization, developing the continent’s talent, 
collaborating more regionally, investing in urban 
infrastructure, and growing more business 
champions are some of the ways Africa can 
increase productivity to support strong and 
sustainable growth.

Introduction 

Africa is home to the world’s youngest and fastest-growing population, burgeoning cities, and 
bold innovations in everything from fintech to clean energy. With its population expected to 
nearly double to 2.5 billion by 2050, the continent has myriad opportunities to harness its rich 
natural resources and abundant human potential to increase economic growth and prosperity 
not only in Africa but around the globe. As the fastest-urbanizing region on the planet, it is an 
exciting new market for many companies. In an aging world, the continent’s young and fast-
growing workforce represents a rich source of talent: some 796 million people will join the 
working population by 2050, and Africa’s workforce will soon be larger than China’s or India’s.

These strengths and assets present an opportunity for the continent to vastly improve its 
productivity and reverse the marked economic deceleration that it endured between 2010 and 
2019. GDP growth fell 35 percent over that period—and then the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. 
Today, 60 percent of Africa’s population lives in poverty, the result of per capita income growth 
that has averaged just 1.1 percent a year since 1960.

Yet the continent-wide statistics obscure successes in many of its constituent countries 
that, while uneven, can serve as models to establish productivity as the foundation of Africa’s 
economic growth, rather than the volatile commodities that have historically played that role. 
Over the past decade, certain countries, cities, and companies have been beacons of innovation, 
productivity, and growth. Their successes offer models and innovations that can reinvigorate 
economies in other African countries that have lacked sufficient growth to propel the 400 million 
Africans living in extreme poverty, as well as others who are less impoverished but remain 
vulnerable, across the empowerment line.1

Geographically, Africa is as large as China, Europe, India, and the United States combined, and 
its 54 countries vary dramatically in population, income level, and governance. Africa is also the 
most economically fragmented region in the world, and the divergent paths of development in 
each of its countries reflect this.2 Understanding and attending to that diversity of qualities and 
outcomes among its constituent countries are critical to any effort to rekindle productivity and 
growth across the continent—there is no “one Africa.” 

Mindful of the diversity of Africa’s economic challenges, this report takes a granular approach in 
its analysis of Africa’s countries, cities, and companies from 2000 to 2019. Each African nation 
can deploy its particular strengths and capabilities in ways that promote productivity-led growth 
and improve lives across the continent at large. Reimagining Africa’s growth is achievable and, 
more than ever, vital for the welfare of the world.

The empowerment line is an MGI estimate of the means required for every individual to achieve sufficiency in basic needs (for 
example, nutrition, energy, housing, healthcare, education, and other essentials) along with economic security, enabling them 
to cross the hurdle of mere subsistence and be empowered to realize their potential.

Africa’s growth has downshifted 
since 2010, after a promising 
opening to the millennium 

Thirteen years ago, MGI published its first report on Africa’s economies, Lions on the move: The 
progress and potential of African economies, a title that reflected the dynamism and power we 
saw radiating from a newly thriving continent. That publication, our subsequent perspectives, 
and work by others contributed to the world’s rising expectations of Africa’s growth and 
economic potential.3

However, when it comes to Africa’s economic performance, not all decades are alike. This report 
focuses on the decade from 2010 to 2019, before COVID-19 swept the world. Its findings are 
drawn from our yearlong study that analyzed the economic performance and potential of African 
countries, cities, and companies, enriched by conversations with many of the continent’s leading 
thinkers and business leaders. 

Looking at this and the two decades before this period—the burst of high growth at the start 
of the century that followed the sluggish 1990s—puts the economic acceleration from 2000 to 
2010 into context. Over the 30-year period from 1990 through 2019, Africa’s real GDP grew at a

rate of 3.7 percent annually, compared with India’s 6.2 percent and China’s 9.1 percent. Given the 
continent’s rapidly expanding population, the contrast between these three regions is even more 
stark on a per capita basis: GDP per capita in Africa grew by only 1 percent per year, compared 
with 5 percent in India and 8 percent in China (Exhibit 1).

millennium. In the decade between 1990 and 2000, Africa’s GDP grew by only 2.5 percent a 
year, or a bit slower than its population growth rate. Unlike China, India, and other regions, the 
continent was not among the first places to benefit from broad corporate moves to offshore 
operations to lower-cost manufacturing bases. Gaps in infrastructure and skills, along with 
relatively high hurdles to conducting business, low levels of intracontinental trade, and 
dependence on natural resources, were obstacles to Africa’s growth.

In the first decade of the 21st century, however, African economies experienced a broad-based 
economic acceleration. Between 2000 and 2010, the continent’s real GDP grew 5.1 percent a 
year, roughly twice the rate of the 1990s. More than two-thirds of the 30 largest economies in 
Africa accelerated their growth during this decade relative to the previous one.4 The continent 
attracted increasing investment and experienced a rise in consumer spending. It also benefited 
from improved political stability, productivity, and business growth. A strong global commodity 
cycle set off a boom in African mining from 2002 to 2007, as metal and oil prices almost tripled 
and foreign investors looked to Africa to help meet growing demand driven by the rapid growth 
of emerging economies elsewhere.5 While many Africans remained poor, the proportion of 
the continent’s population living in extreme poverty fell by ten percentage points. There was 
widespread optimism that, after a long period of stagnation, Africa was rising. 

After 2010, however, Africa’s economic progress slowed due to a confluence of factors 
ranging from waning demand for commodities to deteriorating economic fundamentals in the 
continent’s largest economies. The decade got off to a rocky start, as demand for commodities 
waned. Steep price declines hit oil exporters in particular just as the Arab Spring in 2011 and 
subsequent conflicts and institutional instability slowed economic activity across North Africa. 
Together, countries affected by these trends account for almost three-fifths of the continent’s 
combined GDP. 

Oil price shocks presaged a longer-term decline in other commodities that affected additional 
African countries such as South Africa. The value of African commodity exports fell from 
$256 billion in 2010 to $147 billion in 2019, and the continent’s share of global commodity 
exports declined from 7 percent to 4 percent.6 Crude oil and natural gas accounted for the lion’s 
share of this decline, but exports of more buoyant commodities such as copper ore and coffee 
also stagnated. 

Political instability also increased across the continent and continues, even in countries with 
faster-growing economies. We found that 30 percent of Africa’s population was affected by 
unstable political events such as coups that brought instability in the 2010–19 decade, compared 
with 4 percent in the preceding decade. 

Declining foreign direct investment (FDI) added to economic deceleration on the continent. After 
quintupling to peak in 2008, FDI flows into Africa declined in 31 of Africa’s 54 countries, falling 
fastest in in Nigeria and South Africa, the two largest economies.7 

4  Previous MGI research reported economic acceleration in 27 African countries based on World Bank data for the period 

2000 to 2008. The update in this report reflects a difference of time period (2000 to 2010) and a restatement of the World 
Bank’s GDP estimates, which brought to 30 the number of African countries experiencing accelerated growth in real GDP 
from 2000 to 2010. Due to a lack of data, we have excluded Djibouti, Eritrea, Liberia, Libya, Sao Tome and Principe, Somalia, 
and South Sudan.

5  Previous MGI research has found that such commodity-cycle benefits rarely translate into sustainable growth unless the 

gains are invested for the long term. For more information, see Reverse the curse: Maximizing the potential of resource-rich 
economies, McKinsey Global Institute, December 2013. 
Includes Africa’s five most valuable commodity exports: crude oil, natural gas, gold, platinum, and iron ore.
In 2018, South Africa’s president announced a program to recruit $100 billion in foreign direct investment over the following 
five years. By 2022, net inflows of FDI reached 10 percent of GDP, compared with about 1 percent in years prior.

Finally, Africa’s net external debt, while low by global standards, increased by 24 percentage 
points to 57 percent of GDP by 2019, signaling deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals. 
Debt-servicing costs doubled, and current-account balances halved, making it harder for African 
governments to invest in growth. Just three years later, in 2022, the region’s average debt-
to-GDP ratio stood at 67 percent, a further deterioration triggered by increased government 
spending during the pandemic, weak management of public finance, and high inflation.

All of these developments coincided with and contributed to a steep decline in Africa’s annual 
productivity growth, which fell from 2.2 percent in the 2000–10 decade to 0.8 percent in 
2010–19. Productivity declined sharply in the extractive industries as well as in the services 
sector, which increased output but not enough to keep up with the rapid growth of the sector’s 
workforce as millions of people left work in agriculture and moved to cities (Exhibit 2).

to the level in the 1990s. Population growth outstripped poverty reduction, and the absolute 
number of Africans living in poverty increased by 30 million. More recently, COVID-19 struck 
a further blow: the continent’s GDP contracted by 2.1 percentage points in 2020. Since the 
start of 2020, the number of people living with acute food insecurity has more than doubled to 
roughly 200 million.8 While economic growth has regained some momentum as the pandemic 
has waned, rising energy and food prices coupled with a stronger dollar are taxing consumers 
and presenting challenges for African governments. These include increased civil unrest and 
rising insecurity levels as well as a funding squeeze that the majority of African countries are 
currently experiencing.9 At the same time, the continent must grapple with the longer-term and 
more permanent impacts of climate change (see Box 1, “Climate change holds risks for Africa and 
creates opportunities to reinvigorate its economies”).

Box 1
Climate change holds risks for Africa and creates opportunities to reinvigorate its economies

Looking to the future, climate change may 
pose a new challenge to growth on the 
continent as Africa faces the potential for 
increasing weather-related acute events 
and sustained threats to productivity. More 
frequent and severe droughts are expected 
to affect agriculture and manufacturing. At 
the same time, rising sea levels and greater 
storm severity put coastal cities and key 
infrastructure at risk of flooding. 

Today, 460 million people, or 36 percent of 
the total African population, are exposed 
to at least one form of climate hazard such 
as drought, heat, water stress, or flooding. 
By 2050, this number will almost double 
to 900 million people, or 45 percent of the 
continent’s population, in a 2°C warming 
scenario. Large parts of Africa face a loss 
of labor productivity related to the potential 
for reduced effective working hours from 
rising heat and humidity.

Impacts will not be evenly distributed 
across the continent. Extreme precipitation 

may become more frequent across central 
parts of Africa, while parts of northern and 
southern Africa could experience drought 
in eight out of every ten years. Smallholder 
farmers and pastoralists will experience 
large impacts of climate change and will 
need to adopt new practices in livestock 
management, soil enhancement, and 
irrigation to adapt. For example, in East 
Africa, 40 percent of the population could 
be exposed to agricultural drought over the 
next 30 years.1

Beyond rising physical risks, global efforts 
to decarbonize could affect Africa. The 
continent depends on commodity exports, 
including fossil fuels and minerals, for 
16 percent of its GDP. Some portion of this 
production will be threatened if the world 
uses less fossil fuels and ramps up demand 
for sources of energy that produce lower 
emissions. Under McKinsey’s “current 
trajectory” energy transition scenario, 
global oil demand could peak by 2027 and 

then decline, and global gas demand could 
peak by 2040. 

If leading countries accelerate efforts to 
achieve their net-zero commitments, the 
transition could be even faster. Under such 
an “achieved commitments” scenario, 
global oil demand could peak as soon 
as 2024, while global gas demand could 
peak around 2030.2 Additionally, mining 
in Africa emits more greenhouse gases on 
average than elsewhere in the world, in part 
due to reliance on coal-generated energy 
and emissions-intensive underground 
mining processes. Companies may have 
to take bold actions to adopt renewables. 
In combination, these two effects—lower 
demand for fossil fuels and loss of market 
share to lower-emission producers—could 
result in $150 billion of lost commodity 
revenue annually on the continent.3

Box 1 (continued)

At the same time, the net-zero transition 
also presents opportunities for Africa 
to benefit. Our analysis identified eight 
manufacturing opportunities that together 
could generate up to $2 billion in revenue 
a year in total and create 700,000 new 
jobs by 2030. These businesses include 
assembly of off-grid and microgrid solar 
systems and electric two-wheelers, as well 
as potential and nascent next-generation 
opportunities such as electric vehicle 
charging stations and production of cross-
laminated timber.4

Africa also has the potential to be a supplier 
of green hydrogen as well as a provider of 
carbon credits that by one estimate could 
generate over $100 billion a year by 2050.5 
And the continent can be a much greater 
source of materials needed to support the 
world’s transition to a low-carbon economy. 
For example, we estimate that Africa has 
93 percent of global platinum reserves, 
nearly half of global cobalt and manganese 
reserves, a third of aluminum reserves, 
and 11 percent of copper and lithium 
reserves—all commodities needed in the 

manufacture of green technologies such 
as electric vehicles and wind- and solar-
powered infrastructure.6 

The magnitude of these opportunities 
is unclear as many uncertainties exist, 
not least the pace of the global net-
zero transition and what share of the 
opportunities the continent can capture. 
Making the most of these opportunities for 
Africa will require concerted efforts to grow 
new businesses, secure capital, and build 
technical know-how.

While economic growth has 
regained some momentum as

There is no ‘one Africa’—the 
continent’s recent slowdown masks 
divergence across countries

Behind the aggregate figures and continent-level challenges, African countries have seen a 
significant divergence: across a large, fragmented continent with low levels of intraregional trade, 
there is no such thing as a single African economy. Since 2010, some African countries have 
sustained solid, even accelerating, growth, while others have experienced sharp declines. 

Nearly half of Africa’s people live in countries where annual GDP growth between 2010 and 2019 
exceeded 4.2 percent, the continent’s average growth rate since 2000. These countries were 
largely midsize economies and together accounted for just over a quarter of total African GDP 
in 2019. Their higher annual GDP growth was accompanied by a higher-than-average increase 
in investment, exports, and urban population since 2010. These faster-growing countries are 
generally in the earlier stages of economic development, comparatively less urban, and less 
reliant on mined commodities. Concentrated in East and West Africa, they also export less and 
have lower levels of per capita investment than the African average. 

McKinsey Global Institute | Reimagining economic growth in Africa: Turning diversity into opportunity

8

The other half of Africa’s population lives in slower-growing nations, which include the continent’s 
five largest economies—Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa—as well as its 
ten smallest. Together they accounted for almost 75 percent of Africa’s 2019 GDP. Although 
these countries typically started the decade with a higher level of investment, exports, and 
urbanization, their subsequent growth in these areas lagged behind that of the continent’s more 
dynamic economies. 

There is no doubt the COVID-19 pandemic and the global slowdown and inflation that have 
followed affected all African countries. In our analysis, we look at the 2010–19 period because 
the tumult of the pandemic years clouds the preceding patterns of economic growth. For 
instance, annual GDP growth in 2020 was −1.7 percent compared with 3.3 percent between 
2010 and 2019—what a difference one year of pandemic can make. 

Looking at how economic growth has played out across African countries since 2000, we found 
they fell into the following four clusters (Exhibit 3):10 

 — Consistent growers exceeded Africa’s average growth rate of 4.2 percent a year from 

2000 to 2019. These 13 countries, mostly in East and West Africa, accounted for 41 percent 
of Africa’s population and 21 percent of its GDP in 2019. Over the past 20 years, consistent 
growers have had above-average growth in urbanization, in levels of capital investment, and 
in exports, albeit off a low base. They also have had steady growth in per capita consumption, 
3 percent annually on average. Ethiopia, the largest of the consistent growers, stands out 
for reducing the number of people living in absolute poverty by 30 million out of a total 
population of 115 million over the 2010–19 decade. Rwanda, the second-fastest-growing 
economy during that period, experienced significantly high GDP per capita growth of 
4.6 percent, compared with 0.4 percent on the continent overall. Despite the challenges 
of COVID-19, more than half of these countries had continued to achieve economic growth 
exceeding the continental average of 4.2 percent as of 2022. 

 — Recent accelerators underperformed in the first decade of this century but exceeded 

Africa’s average growth rate from 2010 to 2019. The eight countries in this cluster, all but 
two of which are in West Africa, make up 9 percent of Africa’s population and contributed 
7 percent of its GDP in 2019. Growth in investment per capita, exports, and urbanization in 
these countries shifted from below the African average in the first decade of the century 
to above average since 2010. Aggregate consumption per capita in these nations grew 
2 percent annually on average over the past decade. While the percentage of people living 
in poverty has decreased, growth was not strong enough to reduce their absolute number, 
which increased by roughly one million between 2010 and 2019. Six of these countries had 
economic growth higher than average in 2022.

10  The four clusters include 49 economies with complete GDP data for 2000–19. Djibouti, Eritrea, Sao Tome and Principe, 

Somalia, and South Sudan are excluded.

 — Recent slowdowns outperformed the continent’s average economic growth in the first 

decade, then slowed from 2010 to 2019. These 13 countries include some of Africa’s largest 
economies, such as Egypt, Morocco, and Nigeria, and were home to 37 percent of Africa’s 
population and accounted for 46 percent of Africa’s GDP in 2019. The slowing pace of their 
economic growth over the past decade was driven by slower-than-average growth in exports 
and investment per capita compared with the rest of Africa, even though they had the highest 
levels of urbanization. These economies account for over half of the continent’s exports of 
primary commodities. Between 2010 and 2019, growth in these countries did not keep pace 
with population growth—in aggregate, 27 million more people in this cluster lived in poverty 
at the end of the period—and per capita consumption growth was stagnant at 0.8 percent a 
year on average. 

 — Slow growers consistently underperformed Africa’s average growth rate over the past 

20 years. These 15 countries were home to 13 percent of Africa’s population and accounted 
for 26 percent of its GDP in 2019. They range from some of Africa’s largest economies, such 
as South Africa and Algeria, to nine of its ten smallest economies. Consistent with their 
overall growth rate, they had below-average rates of investment, exports, and urbanization. 
Due to sluggish growth over the long term, eight million more people in these countries lived 
in poverty in 2019 than in 2010, and per capita consumption growth was only a little more 
than zero.

Consistent 
growers and recent accelerator clusters are significantly less productive than their recent 
slowdown and slow grower counterparts, at least for now, as they urbanize and shift employment 
to more productive sectors. They are and will continue to be less dependent on highly productive 
natural resources but have nonetheless had higher productivity growth. Over the past decade, 
their productivity grew at nearly 3 percent annually, much higher than the 1.3 percent productivity 
growth rate among recent slowdowns and the slightly negative productivity growth of slow 
growers—though still lower than the average of 3.7 percent among global emerging markets. 
Even within clusters, there was no “one Africa” when it came to productivity, either; productivity 
levels, particularly among slow growers and recent slowdowns, varied dramatically despite those 
clusters’ relatively higher average productivity overall (Exhibit 4).

In a stark illustration of no “one Africa” at work, decelerating growth among recent slowdown and 
slow grower economies combined to slow the continent’s growth. Had Africa’s GDP continued 
to grow at the pace it achieved from 2000 to 2010, its GDP in 2019 would have been $3 trillion 
instead of $2.6 trillion. Fully 65 percent of this difference can be explained by Africa’s “big three” 
economies, with Egypt and Nigeria among the recent slowdowns and South Africa among the 
slow growers (Exhibit 5). 

Nigeria had the largest impact. Its services sector alone was responsible for 30 percent of the 
continent’s slowing economic pace, as its average annual growth rate fell from 11 percent in the 
2000–10 decade to just 3 percent from 2010 to 2019. This drop reflects the decline in trade—
responsible for one-third of Nigeria’s services-related GDP—attributable to slower growth 
in consumer spending on goods (from 10 percent from 2000 to 2010 to 2 percent annually 
from 2010 to 2019). Growth in other services sectors such as real estate and information and 
communications technology (ICT) also decelerated significantly over the same period. 

Egypt made the second-largest contribution to Africa’s economic deceleration, as its slowing oil 
and gas production shaved 11 percent off growth. South Africa’s economy grew at a consistently 
low pace over both decades. 

Had Africa’s GDP continued 
to grow at the pace it achieved 
from 2000 to 2010, its GDP in 
2019 would have been $3 trillion 
instead of $2.6 trillion.

extraction to services, but productivity still lags behind
Productivity reflects the amount of economic output created by each worker. Growth in 
productivity drives economies, and at the individual level, it can translate into higher living 
standards and well-being. Traditionally, agriculture has dominated the African economy, but 
African agriculture at large is made up of myriad smallholder farms that are generally low in 
productivity, though improving slowly. The other traditional pillar of the African economy is the 
extractive industries, which are highly productive in terms of dollar revenue but employ relatively 
few people, limiting their economic contribution. Productivity has increased only modestly on 
average across all sectors of the African economy over the past two decades and is low across 
the entirety of the African economy relative to peers (Exhibit 6).

Productivity measures output relative to input, or the value of goods and services produced 
divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required to produce them. In 
this paper, we focus on labor productivity, defined as the economic output per worker. This 
productivity measure is commonly used because it is the most consequential determinant 
of long-term economic growth. Thus, establishing productivity as the foundation of African 
economic growth is a key to reinvigorating prosperity and resilience on the continent. 

A structural shift to services
The African economy has been undergoing a profound structural shift to services over the past 
20 years, as people have left work in the fields to take jobs in trade and other services in cities. 
Reflecting that shift, employment in services increased from 30 percent to 39 percent over that 
period, although in 2019, half of the African workforce remained in agriculture.

contributing 56 percent in 2019 compared with 50 percent in 2000 as it captured share from 
the extractive industries, which were hit by the decelerating commodities cycle over that period 
(Exhibit 7). 

A shift to services is a pathway to increased prosperity trod by many countries, and Africa’s shift 
to services closely mirrors what occurred in India.11 Such a transition provides a productivity 
boost, since service-sector productivity is higher than that of agriculture (though generally less 
than in the industrial sector).

Services create significant opportunities for African countries to boost economic output and 
job creation—but only if productivity in the sector improves. Real productivity, a measure of 
efficiency, in the continent’s services sector was $7,200 in 2019, compared with $8,900 in 
India, $17,700 in Latin America, and $20,900 in China. In other words, African productivity 
was the lowest of any region in the world. Nor has it grown since; the sector recorded negative 
productivity growth of -0.1 percent during the 2010–19 decade.

From 2000 to 2010, the services sector in Africa increased productivity by 1.8 percent, and 
simply returning to that level would increase the sector’s gross value added (GVA) by $400 billion 
by 2030. Additionally, if Africa matched the productivity growth of Asia’s strongest services 
hubs, it could add $1.4 trillion to the continent’s economy, almost doubling the GVA from services 
today. This would create 225 million jobs by 2030—a crucial consideration in the light of Africa’s 
rapidly growing workforce. Even on its current trajectory, the services sector will create at least 
85 million net new jobs across the continent by 2030, sufficient to absorb almost half of all new 
labor-market entrants. 

Productivity has not been uniform across the African services sector. Employment in trade grew 
most in absolute numbers and accounts for almost half of Africa’s service jobs, or some 80 million 
people across the continent. Yet the trade subsector in Africa, characterized by high levels of 
informality and fragmentation, has very low productivity by global standards. It has absorbed 
millions of people who moved out of agriculture and into informal, precarious, and low-paid jobs.

subsectors and contribute the greatest economic value, accounting for nearly a fifth of Africa’s 
GVA today (Exhibit 8). This subsector encompasses banking, insurance, scientific research 
and development, travel agencies and related activities, and rental and leasing activities. 
Financial and business services contributed more than one-third of the GVA created by Africa’s 
shift to services from 2000 to 2019 but less than 10 percent of the employment shift over the 
same period.

Many other services subsectors are suitable for growth locally and globally. Targeted 
interventions to raise their productivity include increasing digitization, developing skills, and 
exporting talent. Tourism, for example, is another fast-growing, employment-intensive services 
subsector that could benefit from such interventions. Africa will soon have the world’s largest 
working-age population, which could meet the growing global talent shortage via services 
outsourcing (Exhibit 9).

In particular, ICT and digital technologies have transformative cross-sector effects that could 
boost the services sector’s productivity overall. The emerging digital transformation taking 
place on the continent is evident in the vibrancy of its technology start-ups, which numbered 
more than 5,000 in 2021. Yet ICT infrastructure, access, and usage lag behind—only 14 percent 
of households had internet access in 2019. Even in cities, half the population does not use the 
internet. Tackling these digital bottlenecks is a crucial first step because digital infrastructure is 
critical to improving productivity in the services sector. 

Africa will soon have the 
world’s largest working-age 
population, which could meet the 
growing global talent shortage 
via services outsourcing.

An opportunity to increase domestic and export manufacturing
The industrial sector, which spans manufacturing, construction, and utilities, also presents 
opportunities to spur productivity. As the continent rapidly shifted to services over the past two 
decades, the relative size of the industrial sector remained constant, accounting for roughly 
12 percent of employment and 20 percent of output. Its share of employment increased in 
only 14 African countries from 2010 to 2019. One such exception was Ghana, where industrial 
employment as a share of total employment increased from 10 percent in 2010 to 16 percent 
in 2019. 

Nonetheless, the sector had the highest productivity growth of any sector in Africa over that 
period—1 percent a year on average compared with 0.8 percent across sectors—and is the only 
sector in which productivity growth did not decline over the 20-year period. Faster-growing 
economies in the consistent growers and recent accelerators clusters in particular benefited 
from accelerated growth in manufacturing output and the associated boost in productivity.

the continent can produce to meet burgeoning local demand, produce for global markets, 
and, where needed, reduce dependence on imports. For example, apparel manufacturing has 
increased significantly in Ethiopia to address demand in global markets, while Gabon doubled 
employment in its wood processing industry from 2010 to 2019.12 Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana, which 
together produce more than 60 percent of the world’s cocoa, doubled their share of locally 
processed cocoa beans from 15 percent to almost 30 percent from 2000 to 2019. They recently 
joined forces to continue raising the industry’s GVA and prosperity for cocoa-growing regions. 
Additional potential areas will continue to materialize, especially as multinational companies seek 
to diversify their supply chains. 

Vaccines are an example of a product where Africa is looking to ensure greater self-
sufficiency. They fell under the spotlight during the COVID-19 pandemic when a lack of local 
vaccine manufacturing capacity left many African countries struggling to procure a sufficient 
supply of vaccines for their populations.13 To prevent such shortages, the African Union set 
up the Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing, with the goal of increasing vaccine 
manufacturing to meet 60 percent of the continent’s demand by 2040. Currently there are 
more than 30 initiatives to support vaccine manufacturing in several African countries, including 
Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa.14 

Building a robust industrial sector will require investment to increase the capacity of African 
manufacturing, create jobs at scale, and achieve the industrial sector’s full economic potential 
continent-wide. To unlock the continent’s potential, African public- and private-sector leaders 
can also work to realize the full potential of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), 
which aims to reduce border constraints and increase intra-Africa trade as well as support 
economies of scale, increase competitiveness, and encourage flows of technology and 
talent. Establishing more seamless, frictionless, and tighter connections among countries 
on the continent will ensure that those investments pay off (see Box 2, “Imagining a more 
interconnected Africa”). 

Africa’s industrialization opportunity includes increasing manufacturing output for African 
markets as well as for export markets beyond the continent. At a global level, Africa accounts for 
2 percent of total manufacturing output, but only 0.6 percent of imports of manufactured goods 
globally come from the continent. If African countries were to match India’s rate of production 
for domestic markets and achieve its 2 percent share of manufactured goods sold, they would 
unlock $140 billion in additional economic value by 2030, implying 2.1 percent productivity 
growth annually compared with just 0.4 percent over the past decade.

Box 2
Imagining a more interconnected Africa 

Africa trades much more with economies beyond the continent than within it. Only 10 percent of 
imports come from another African country, and 17 percent of exports are going somewhere else on 
the continent. By contrast, across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, 21 percent 
of imports and 22 percent of exports are intraregional, while in Latin America, intraregional trade 
accounts for 19 percent of imports and 20 percent of exports. Europe is Africa’s largest trading 
partner, followed by China, and both trade far more with the continent than its countries trade with one 
another (Exhibit 10). 

China is the largest trading partner and has the broadest trade linkages with Africa. For some smaller 
countries with relatively low overall trade volumes, such as Benin, Republic of Congo, Madagascar, 
and Mauritania, China is the main trading partner. Nonetheless, most trade value goes to and comes 
from Europe.

The sources of intra-African imports are fairly evenly distributed across the continent. In contrast, 
almost 80 percent of exports of African countries are to countries outside the continent. With 53 
African trading partners, South Africa accounts for 32 percent, or more than $35 billion, of the flow 
of intracontinental goods, the most such trade on the continent. Nigeria comes in second with more 
than $7 billion in flows across 51 African partners. For some smaller economies like Mali, Rwanda, and 
Togo, the main trading partner is another nearby African country. 

To increase intra-Africa trade volumes, the most critical value chains can be prioritized based on their 
potential for import substitution, contribution to economic growth, and inclusivity of women, youth, 
and small and medium-size enterprises, as well as feasibility. Agro-processing, pharmaceuticals, 
automotive, and logistics could deliver substantial value, but significant investment and bold 
interventions are needed to realize their potential. For example, improving transportation and logistics 
would require reducing customers’ delays at borders, increasing the quantity and availability of quality 
trucks through financing, and scaling cold chain storage and transportation, which are among the 
priorities of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

Reversing the trend and driving a shift in extracted commodities 
Currently, most African exports are extracted commodities. However, extractive industries, which 
employ a much smaller workforce than other sectors, saw a sharp drop in the proportion of value 
they added to the African economy—from 14 percent in 2010 to 8 percent in 2019. Productivity 
in the extractive industries also declined from −1 percent a year on average from 2000 to 2010 
to an average of −5 percent a year in the subsequent decade. This decline occurred in all clusters 
except for consistent growers, where extractive industries in Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia 
recently increased productivity. 

Among Africa’s five most valuable commodities—crude oil, natural gas, gold, platinum, and iron 
ore—export revenues grew 17 percent a year on average in the 2000s. However, 75 percent 
of that growth was due to increased prices. From 2010 to 2019, revenues from exported 
commodities fell by 6 percent annually on average, with 60 percent of the decline driven by 
shrinking volumes. For some commodities, this decline was far more pronounced than in the

For example, crude oil volumes in Africa dropped 41 percent compared with an 
11 percent decline elsewhere. Natural gas volumes in Africa fell even more, by 59 percent, even as 
they increased 29 percent in the rest of the world. 

Nonetheless, extraction remains the highest-productivity sector on the continent as in the 
rest of the world. It is not, however, a large employer, and the cyclical and volatile nature of 
primary commodity prices makes it difficult to base a sustainable economy on this sector 
alone. Additionally, resource wealth across Africa has not always translated into greater human 
development, due to the complex connections between resource extraction and governance. 

Going forward, Africa’s vast resources will need to better support its growth. Hydrocarbons will 
continue to be important for the continent, and reversing declining production will be imperative. 
At the same time, the sector can work to further decarbonize production by changing energy 
sources used in the production process, increasing efficiency to limit energy consumption in the 
production process, and attracting significant investment in carbon offsets to ensure net-zero 
production. To make the most of their significant gas resources, gas-rich countries should focus 
not only on providing incentives for production and reducing flaring to meet domestic and global 
demand; they will also need to urgently invest in the requisite infrastructure for transportation, 
processing, and distribution of these gas resources to support local industrialization and to grow 
export revenues. 

Africa also has many ways of reducing its reliance on traditional extraction to grow its economy 
and establish more transparent governance of trade in commodities that are newly in demand 
as a result of the world’s transition toward net zero. It has many of the materials needed for the 
journey, such as cobalt, bauxite, platinum, and copper; tapping those stores of value will initially 
entail securing appropriate access to resources through fair regulation and licensing. Working 
to ensure the rapid development of low-carbon energy supplies for the extractive industries, 
particularly metals, will also be important. Capital will be needed for new projects and built 
infrastructure, while existing operations can be enhanced through local capability building and 
the transfer of expertise. Such advances also represent an opportunity to train workers with the 
skill sets for the new economy.

Finally, Africa can improve the downstream part of the metals value chain, such as smelting 
and refining, to increase value added and infrastructure development. Automotive companies, 
battery OEMs, and other downstream players can play enabling roles through strong 
partnerships with extractive businesses. Investing in automation and digital technologies will 
further enhance the sector’s productivity. 15 

Achieving the long-awaited African green revolution
Rapid growth in the African services and industrial sectors will still leave hundreds of millions 
of people working in agriculture. Agriculture is the backbone of many African economies, 
providing more than 70 percent of employment in rural areas, 49 percent of the continent’s total 
employment, and 15 percent of total value added. The sector’s productivity and output improved 
steadily over the past two decades as millions of workers left for jobs in other sectors. Over 
time, the primary driver of agricultural growth has shifted from big increases in the labor force 
to growth in real agricultural capital stock. Yet African agricultural yields and productivity lag 
behind the standards of global peers, and action is needed to improve and ensure the livelihoods 
of African farmers, who are a mainstay of many economies and remain crucial to the continent’s 
food security.

Though Africa remains a net food importer, the trade balance in agricultural products 
has improved over the past decade. In 2011, the value of net agricultural imports was nearly 
$30 billion. In 2021, the balance was about $6 billion. Ethiopia, Morocco, and Rwanda have 
experienced rapid growth of crop outputs, but neither those countries nor Africa as a whole have 
achieved a green revolution similar to those in China, India, and other developing regions. 

At less than $2,000 per worker on average, Africa’s agricultural GVA is the lowest globally, 
which partly explains why so many people are leaving the land to seek better opportunities in 
the services sector. Although estimates of untapped agricultural land on the continent range 
from 480 million to 840 million hectares, much of that land is unreachable or heavily forested, 
so Africa will need to increase the sector’s productivity and learn to produce more with less. 
Over the past decade, agricultural productivity in most African countries has improved at a rate 
too slow to close the gap with the rest of the world, exceeding the global average in only eight 
of Africa’s 54 countries. Especially in a context of climate change and geopolitical volatility, the 
continent’s slow growth in agricultural output could threaten its ability to feed its people.

Our analysis finds that if African countries were to match the productivity growth that Indian 
agriculture experienced from 1980 to 1990, they would collectively add $200 billion of value to 
their economies by 2030—or $40 billion more than expected at current productivity levels. The 
impact on food production could be tremendous. For example, analysis by McKinsey suggests 
that Africa could produce two to three times more cereals and grains than it does today, which 
would add 20 percent more cereals and grains to current worldwide output. Similar increases are 
possible in the production of livestock and horticultural crops.16

How, then, can African countries unleash an improvement in agricultural productivity and the 
farmer incomes it would deliver? To start, countries can separate their agricultural growth 
strategies from their social benefits programs. A government-coordinated agricultural 
growth strategy could focus on enabling the private sector to deliver strong economic growth 
and returns. Social benefit programs for those working in the sector, by contrast, could focus on 
initiatives such as direct cash transfers to smallholder farmers to achieve social objectives such 
as poverty reduction, rural community welfare, food security, and societal stability. 

To transform and boost food production and productivity, countries can pursue four strategies. 
First, countries can maximize output value by aligning production resources and production 
choices with comparative advantage, shifting to higher-value production and increasing value 
added via agro-processing. Second, countries can boost production by building the right 
logistics systems to get produce to consumers. Third, countries can empower “midsize change 
agents” by enabling farms of all sizes to mobilize through a system of traders and warehouse 
aggregators. Fourth, African countries, together with the private sector, can develop financial 
solutions that enable forward contracts and access to futures markets to allow farmers to 
hedge against falling prices and bring greater price stability to the market. 

To improve food security beyond the economic needs of domestic and export production, African 
countries can develop capabilities to evaluate economic and food security trade-offs. This would 
involve using levers other than domestic production—for example, strategic reserves, hedging, 
strategic importation and trade agreements, subsidies, distribution systems, social education 
campaigns, and food-waste management.

Africa is the world’s fastest-
urbanizing region but depends 
too heavily on its primary cities

The future of Africa lies in its vibrant cities. Although 57 percent of its population lived in rural 
areas in 2019, the continent is urbanizing faster than any other place on the planet. Since 
2000, Africa’s urban population has grown 3.7 percent, outpacing global population growth of 
2.5 percent. Over the next two decades, the continent will become majority urban as more than 
500 million people arrive in its cities and create the largest total number of urban dwellers in 
the world.

Urbanization is generally a positive economic force and a crucial driver of economic growth, 
especially in low-income countries. Cities contribute significantly to overall country GDP and 
are valuable sites of productive employment opportunities. In Africa’s largest cities, households 
earned and consumed more than twice as much as the rest of Africa from 2000 to 2019, and 
these cities also had a much lower share of poor households, 2 percent compared with 9 percent 
on the continent overall.17

17  Based on a sample of Africa’s 35 largest cities (excluding Lubumbashi, Mbuji-Mayi, and Mogadishu). These cities account for 

13 percent of Africa’s total population and 31 percent of Africa’s GDP.

McKinsey Global Institute | Reimagining economic growth in Africa: Turning diversity into opportunity

27

The number of large African cities will multiply. By 2040, the continent will be home to 12 cities of 
more than ten million people each as ten more cities join Cairo and Lagos. Additionally, 19 cities 
will have populations between five million and ten million, or nine more such cities than there 
are today.18 These 31 cities will be spread across the continent and split evenly among countries 
across all four clusters. In 24 of them, GDP increased faster than GDP in the country overall 
over the past decade (Exhibit 11). As a weighted average, GDP in all 31 cities grew 4 percent 
compared with an average of 3.2 percent in their countries and 3.3 percent across Africa over the 
same period.

With cities as with countries, however, there is no “one Africa.” City growth varied across country 
clusters—not surprising, perhaps, since cities typically drive country-level growth. Within the 
clusters, there was also wide variation, with some cities thriving in spite of a declining national 
economy and vice versa (Exhibit 12). Cities in consistent grower countries had the biggest gains 
in GDP and population from 2000 to 2019. They represented nearly 80 percent of the cities in 
faster-growing clusters that will have five million or more residents by 2040. Cities in clusters 
that grew more slowly than average—recent slowdowns and slow growers—also expanded more 
slowly, accounting for roughly 40 percent of cities that will have five million or more residents 
by 2040. GDP is not growing fast enough in these cities to meaningfully offset their population 
growth of 2.7 percent on an unweighted-average basis. As a result, their GDP per capita 
decreased by 0.1 percent annually over the past decade compared with growth of 2.6 percent a 
year in cities within faster-growing economies. Fostering accelerated economic growth in these 
cities is an urgent priority.

We define primary cities in Africa as the largest city in each country. These cities attracted 
67 percent of total urban migration over the past two decades. Champions of GDP growth, they 
also contributed nearly a third of Africa’s nominal GDP in 2019.19 

By 2040, Africa will be home to 
12 cities of more than ten million 
people each as ten more cities 
join Cairo and Lagos.

19 

18  2040 population figures rely on estimates from Oxford Economics. The basis of population forecasting at the city level 
is a natural change and net migration model. Birth rate and death rate in a city relative to national figures are projected, 
and census or historical estimates of population by age as a starting point are used. Then, how births enter into the city’s 
population, deaths exit, and people move through the age bands is modeled over time. Finally, migration is added, which 
is forecast through the economic performance of a city relative to the country. 2040 population figures for Lubumbashi, 
Mbuji-Mayi, and Mogadishu and are estimated by extrapolating UN 2035 population estimates to 2040 using the 2030–35 
population growth rate.
In the sample of 48 primary cities in the data set we use, across time from 2000, the urban wealth scaling exponent (percent 
increase in log GDP with 1 percent increase in log population) is 1.13, the same as some studies found in the United States 
and Germany and just below the 1.15 observed in China. See Luís M. A. Bettencourt, “The origins of scaling in cities,” Science, 
volume 340, number 6139, June 2013; Luís M. A. Bettencourt et al., “Growth, innovation, scaling, and the pace of life in cities,”

not nearly as vibrant or dynamic as their larger cousins. Among a set of the largest countries on 
the continent, only four of 14 have a second city larger than half the size of their primary city.20 
In five countries, the second city has a population of less than 25 percent of the primary city’s 
population. By contrast, in Brazil, China, India, and the United States, the population of the 
second city is more than 60 percent of the population of the largest city (Exhibit 13).

This points to an opportunity for Africa’s second cities, which today are adding people more 
slowly than primary cities. On average, the populations of second cities grew 2.5 percent from 
2000 to 2019, while those of primary cities increased 3 percent. In fact, less than half of second 
cities in our sample were growing faster than Africa’s continent-wide population growth rate of 
2.6 percent. 

African countries have an opportunity to significantly expand their second cities. Of course a 
second city cannot make itself into something it is not: ports, resource extraction hubs, and 
tourist hubs require significant natural endowments and infrastructure. However, second cities, 
supported by national governments, can focus on getting the basics of urbanization right by 
identifying competitive advantages, investing to improve the enabling environment, exploring 
partnerships to attract investment, planning and building green infrastructure, and insisting on 
opportunity for all through inclusion of city outskirts and by building affordable housing.

A focus on second cities should not divert attention from the reality that many African cities have 
a need for sustainable investment in essential services and critical infrastructure. Different cities 
have different critical needs, but in growing urban communities, affordable housing is high on the 
priority list. Compared with other emerging regions, Africa has significant infrastructure gaps, 
especially in access to electricity, water, paved roads, and the internet. Urban infrastructure 
supports economic development in powerful ways. The number of African people living in urban 
centers will double over the next 20 years, and critical to the continent’s ability to accommodate 
its rising population is the built environment and its supporting infrastructure—transportation, 
power, water, and telecom systems. 

However, Africa’s urban infrastructure is significantly deficient across nearly all infrastructure 
asset classes. For example, 100 million residents of African cities, or 18 percent of the urban 
population, lack access to electricity. While countries such as Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia have 
attained nearly full urban electrification, in others like the Central African Republic, urban electric 
coverage is less than 40 percent. The gap is even greater in water and sanitation infrastructure 
and services; 66 percent of Africa’s urban population has no access to such services. 

A comparative study using satellite imagery found that urban roads in Africa occupy a smaller 
share of land than in other major urban areas around the world. Those roads that do exist 
in African cities are disproportionately clustered near their centers, leaving the outskirts 
disconnected. Housing is similarly scarce, and more than 60 percent of the continent’s urban 
population lives in slums, a figure that tops 90 percent in some countries such as South Sudan. 
Africa’s telecommunications infrastructure is a bright spot, with universal mobile phone coverage 
across all urban areas. 

20  The 14 countries are the overlapping sets of the ten largest countries by population and the ten largest countries by GDP 
(excluding Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Libya, Sudan, and Uganda because of limited data 
availability).

In this instance, we’ve shown Kano as Nigeria’s second city as it’s more consistent with traditional definitions of Nigeria’s cities.Source: Oxford EconomicsIn aggregate, insufficient urban infrastructure prevents African cities from reaping the benefits 
of scale and agglomeration. The scale of infrastructure investment required on the continent 
is estimated to be roughly 8.6 percent of GDP annually.21 Urban areas require the greatest 
investment in infrastructure asset classes such as sanitation, with cities needing 70 percent 
of the overall investment.22 However, significant improvements in how countries invest in 
infrastructure projects and the impact this infrastructure has on national economies, including on 
sustainability and inclusivity, is needed to justify such spending. 

To do more with less, cities can explore private partnerships, introduce investment accountability, 
assess and manage expenses, and embrace technology. To attract private-sector financing 
in particular, governments and their institutional partners can take decisive action to improve 
the commercial viability of projects by mitigating political, currency, and regulatory risks and by 
increasing the number of bankable projects.23

Implemented with coordination and coherence, infrastructure plans could improve individual 
welfare and deliver real socioeconomic returns. Each dollar invested in such projects is 
estimated to add 20 cents to GDP.24 Investing to expand and enhance the productivity of urban 
infrastructure and attracting private capital for infrastructure investment, therefore, are crucial to 
turning Africa’s rapid urbanization into the valuable asset it could be. 

The scale of infrastructure 
investment required on 
the continent is estimated 
to be roughly 8.6 percent 
of GDP annually.

Two thriving second cities 

Cape Town in South Africa and Kumasi in 
Ghana are two cities that have adopted 
policies and made investments that 
illustrate the opportunities to invigorate 
Africa’s second cities. 

They reflect the divergent growth paths 
of Africa’s economies. South Africa is a 
slow grower, and Cape Town’s GDP grew 
1.7 percent on average annually over the 
most recent decade. Kumasi mirrored 
Ghana’s progress as a consistent grower, 
achieving an average of 8 percent annual 
GDP growth from 2010 to 2019. Rapid 
migration combined with high birth rates 
among their existing populations mean that 
GDP is spread more thinly, and Cape Town’s 
GDP per capita grew by just 0.4 percent 
a year on average since the start of the 
millennium, while Kumasi’s grew by an 
average 3.6 percent a year.

In Cape Town, public–private initiatives 
have attracted about 20 additional direct 

flights from major global markets over 
the past decade, resulting in two million 
annual foreign tourists in the city and 
contributing an estimated 200,000 direct 
jobs—about 10 percent of the city’s total. 
Its tech sector has attracted investment, 
and the city is now home to 200 fintech 
start-ups and data and engineering hubs of 
global technology companies drawn by its 
universities and low labor costs. 

The city has developed a bus rapid transit 
system to relieve urban congestion and 
support its investment in tourism, and it 
generates its own electricity, reducing the 
impact of national power outages that have 
depressed South Africa’s overall growth.

Kumasi is rich in mineral resources, 
including two of the largest gold mines in 
the world. Yet the city has worked to grow 
its manufacturing subsector, including 
textiles, agro-processing, and wood 
products. And Deutsche Bank has stepped 

in to support the expansion and renovation 
of the Kumasi Central Market, West 
Africa’s largest market with 12,000 shops 
and stalls.1 

Together with the World Bank, Kumasi 
is working to introduce a transit system 
similar to Cape Town’s, which will reduce 
travelers’ reliance on the informal taxis and 
vans called tro-tros, though it will need 
to extend water and sanitation facilities 
further from the city center where many of 
its newest residents live. 

These two second cities demonstrate 
how, with similar support from multilateral 
and private financial institutions and 
corporations as well as local innovations, 
many of Africa’s second cities can 
capitalize on their strengths to step up 
economic growth and productivity.

Africa’s large companies have proven 
resilient—and most have considerable 
unmet potential for growth

Large private companies have an important role to play in rekindling economic progress in 
Africa because they contribute disproportionately to growth, innovation, employment, exports, 
productivity, and taxes. Previous MGI research found that emerging economies with consistently 
high growth rates had twice as many large companies as other economies.25 The effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a slowdown in the global economy and rising inflation, have 
intensified pressures on performance and the need for growth. Africa’s big companies have 
proven resilient in the face of challenges over the past decade and now are well positioned to 
grow. Their success and growth will have positive knock-on effects among the myriad small and 
medium-size enterprises that participate in their supply chains and support the vast majority of 
jobs on the continent.

Already the continent’s entrepreneurial vibrancy is showing encouraging signs: funding of 
technology start-ups across Africa increased by 18 times between 2015 and 2021.26 Large 
companies, too, have grown revenues faster than continent-wide GDP since 2015. On an 
unweighted basis, these companies grew 3 percent per year on average over that period, a 
growth rate that rises to 5 percent annually on a weighted basis.27

Africa is home to many large companies
At least 345 companies in Africa have annual revenues of $1 billion or more. Collectively they 
produce revenues of more than $1 trillion (Exhibit 14). About 230 of these 345 companies are 
homegrown, meaning they were started in an African country, often by a local entrepreneur. 
Fifty-two of the continent’s $1 billion–plus companies are state-owned enterprises. These large 
companies operate in all major sectors on the continent, but 70 percent of the revenues they 
generate come from just six subsectors: oil and gas, mining, retail and consumer goods, financial 
services, manufacturing, and telecommunications.

Data for African countries and cities reveals great diversity among them, and Africa-level 
statistics for large companies show similar significant variation—here, too, there is no “one 
Africa.” Roughly 40 percent of the 345 companies are based in South Africa, a disproportionately 
large share relative to its GDP. Of the 147 large companies headquartered there, 118 are 
homegrown while the rest are foreign owned. This suggests an opportunity to expand the 
corporate footprint in other African countries.  

An additional 32 percent, or 111 companies, are in other slow grower or recent slowdown 
economies. The number of companies in the largest of these economies—Algeria, Angola, Egypt, 
and Nigeria—is in line with similarly sized economies around the world such as Brazil, China, 
and India, but still far lower than South Africa’s 147 large companies. For example, Egypt’s GDP 
is four-fifths the size of South Africa’s, but the country is home to only 33 large companies, or 
one-fifth the number of companies in South Africa. Nigeria’s GDP is larger than South Africa’s, 
but only 23 large companies are headquartered there—just 16 percent of the number of large 
companies in South Africa.

Surprisingly, recent accelerator and consistent grower countries—those where GDP grew more 
than 4.2 percent from 2010 to 2019—are home to few large companies. The countries in these 
clusters account for 28 percent of Africa’s nominal GDP but have only 10 percent of its large 
companies. This is likely because on a stand-alone basis, these countries are smaller markets.

and the remainder are state-owned enterprises. The rest of the large companies operating in 
Africa are subsidiaries of foreign firms, roughly 37 percent of which are publicly traded and the 
remainder private, including a few state-owned enterprises primarily from China. Compared 
with other markets, foreign-owned companies have a disproportionately significant role in 
African countries. They account for one-third of all large companies in Africa and roughly one-
third of corporate revenues as well. Given the relative significance of these institutions, foreign 
firms could work to become more entwined in the fabric of the African business economy and 
operate more as homegrown companies than as subsidiaries of global giants. Previous McKinsey 
research has found that winners in Africa often tailor their offerings and business models to the 
markets where they operate and build local teams and talent pools.28 

The ownership structure of companies also varies by sector. Large homegrown and foreign 
public and private companies are concentrated in services, while state-owned enterprises are 
more involved in extractive industries (Exhibit 15).

The performance of large companies in Africa varied dramatically between 2015 and 2021, a 
period that included a global commodities downturn and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Proportionally, the number of large corporations on the continent shrank compared with those 
in other regions and countries. We estimate that since 2015, Africa has lost 16 percent of its 
businesses with revenues exceeding $1 billion (only one-tenth of the loss was due to exchange 
rate effects) and added 9 percent more new large firms—resulting in a net decrease in large 
companies. Some 50 percent of the large companies that closed, were acquired, or had declining 
revenue were in the services sector, with 19 percent in extractive industries and 18 percent in 
manufacturing, construction, and utilities. In comparison, Latin America has had a 31 percent 
increase in large firms since 2015, and China and India, respectively, attracted 57 percent and 
30 percent more companies with revenues of more than $1 billion.

Nonetheless, the continent’s large companies in aggregate grew revenues by 4.9 percent 
annually on average from 2015 to 2021. Certain types of companies, though, performed better 
than others. Specifically, South African companies increased revenues at an average rate of 
5.5 percent a year, and North African companies by 4.4 percent a year. Companies in the rest of 
Africa fared far less well. Their revenues declined by 1.7 percent on average over that period, as 
exchange rates fell. Currency values fell 16 percent on average in South Africa and 80 percent 
across North Africa, while across the rest of the continent, they fell on average by 189 percent 
(Exhibit 16).29

Additionally, the revenues of homegrown companies grew slightly faster than those of companies 
in Africa with headquarters elsewhere, by 5.5 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. Companies 
in consistent grower economies increased revenues at a rate of 2.2 percent on average, which 
was slower than companies grew in other clusters. Revenues of companies in the recent 
accelerators cluster grew 5.6 percent, those in recent slowdowns grew 4.1 percent, and large 
businesses in slow growers grew 5.3 percent.

Across sectors and on a weighted basis, the best-performing sectors were power and utilities, 
agriculture, and mining, each of which increased revenues more than 10 percent annually on 
average. Revenues in sectors such as IT, financial services, and retail and consumer goods grew 
more than 4 percent. Oil and gas companies, which outnumber firms in all other sectors, faced 
significant price headwinds and so were an exception as their revenues declined by more than 
1 percent annually on average.

However, variation in growth within sectors dwarfed variation in growth between sectors, 
suggesting potential to improve average firm performance across all sectors. In nearly every 
sector, at least one large company’s revenue grew at more than twice the average sector growth 
rate from 2015 to 2021—and sometimes by much more. Similarly, at least one large company in 
every sector except healthcare had revenues that declined more than 5 percent per year. 

29  The change in exchange rate by region was calculated as the unweighted average of the percent change of exchange rate 

(local currency units per dollar) from 2015 to 2021 of countries in each region. Local currency growth rates were higher and, 
accordingly, resulted in falling growth rates due to depreciation that took place in most markets.

As GDP growth recovers in many parts of the continent, large companies have considerable 
potential for value creation. We estimate that more than half of the 345 large companies in Africa 
could increase their revenues collectively by more than $550 billion by 2030 with ambitious 
strategies to access new markets, strengthen productivity, and increase operational efficiency.30 
Sixty percent of Africa’s large companies are based in Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa, so 
the continent’s smaller, faster-growing nations represent a promising next horizon for new 
business growth. 

While all sectors on the continent have growth opportunities, companies in the services sector 
could capture 60 percent of the overall revenue potential, or $330 billion, while the oil and gas 
subsector could produce nearly one-third, or $160 billion. About 12 percent of the potential, or 
$65 billion, could come from mining and metals.31

Companies can begin by looking closely at their geographic and product portfolios and prepare 
to reallocate capital to the fastest-growing countries and cities as well as the highest-return 
opportunities. For example, opportunities exist to serve both B2B and B2C markets; 130 million 
new members of the consuming class will join Africa’s markets by 2030, making B2C a promising 
opportunity (see Box 4, “Africa has the potential to unlock more than $3 trillion in consumer 
spending—but this will take more than a growing population”). 

An important enabler of corporate growth will be partnerships with stakeholders ranging from 
African governments to local communities to investors. Successful partnerships will incorporate 
environmental, social, and governance goals and metrics, helping companies support and 
enhance the societies they operate in and embrace sustainability and inclusion to propel growth. 
To capitalize on those opportunities, companies across all sectors will need to improve their 
competitiveness. Many of them can adopt leaner, simpler operating models; invest in building 
capabilities among their future leaders; adopt a digital-first approach to replace legacy systems 
with technology platforms; and harness analytics to identify growth pockets and reduce costs. 

Across all sectors, five key common levers for growth emerge. First, companies can envision 
themselves as African champions, creating value first and foremost for Africa and its people. For 
instance, mining companies could build more robust mineral refining and processing operations 
to capture the full value of the continent’s natural resources. Second, companies can integrate 
more into the world. For example, homegrown manufacturing companies could look beyond 
continental borders to find new markets and cheaper suppliers or to bring in new technologies. 
Third, companies can address needs in their local communities more actively. For example, banks 
and telecom operators can expand access to financial services at the bottom of the pyramid 
through digital channels. Fourth, companies can work more closely with governments and 
policy makers, for example in the way that businesses came together to support government 
effectively during the COVID-19 crisis in countries like Nigeria and South Africa. Last, 
companies can prioritize the energy transition. For instance, oil and gas companies could work 
to decarbonize their operations to meet the world’s climate-change goals and attract increased 
capital investment. 

30  The potential to deliver $550 billion in additional revenue by 2030 was identified across seven sectors: oil and gas, retail, 

telecommunications, banking, manufacturing, consumer packaged goods, and insurance. 

31  Capturing the revenue opportunity in the mining sector is not straightforward and is highly contingent on certain assumptions 

(for example, regarding infrastructure) becoming true.

Box 4
Africa has the potential to unlock more than $3 trillion in consumer 
spending—but this will take more than a growing population 

Tens of millions of new consumers emerge in Africa every year, as its population grows and 
the continent urbanizes. By 2030, some 130 million additional people are likely to enter the 
consuming class; by comparison, India is expected to add 140 million new consumers over the 
same period, the United States 25 million, and China six million.1 Europe’s consumer base is 
expected to shrink by five million. 

Increasing consumer spending has made the biggest contribution to Africa’s GDP growth over 
the past two decades and has the potential to help boost growth over the next ten years as well. 
It also provides an opportunity for businesses to create value, by offering affordable prices at 
scale, targeting expansion in growth hot spots, and innovating within local value chains. 

There is, again, no “one Africa” consumer market. The largest consumer segment in Africa 
spends between $2 and $11 a day. This group accounted for 31 percent of consumption in 2019. 
Spending on basic goods and services as well as food, housing expenses, and transportation 
accounted for more than 60 percent of consumption on the continent, spending that is now 
under pressure from inflationary headwinds. 

However, consumer patterns diverge across clusters and countries. Discretionary spending 
accounted for most of consumption growth over the past decade in the more mature economies 
of recent slowdowns and slow growers. Consumers in consistent growers and recent 
accelerators spread their activity across basic and discretionary spending. 

Because Africa still lags behind other regions in consumption, vigorous productivity and wage 
growth are needed to accelerate increased consumer spending in Africa and to continue to 
reduce the number of people below the empowerment line (Exhibit 17). Growth in consumer 
spending decelerated in the most recent decade, dropping to 3.3 percent annually on average 
from an average annual growth rate of 5.8 percent between 2000 and 2010. In the first ten years 
of the millennium, rising average incomes accounted for two-thirds of growth in consumption, 
and population growth for the remainder. As continent-wide growth stalled between 2010 and 
2019, rising incomes represented only 24 percent of the increase in African consumption, while 
population growth drove the lion’s share—a reminder of the potential embedded in Africa’s future 
consumption, especially if a rise in income levels accompanies population growth. Nonetheless, 
even if the slower overall consumption growth of the past decade persists, the growth of Africa’s 
consumer market to 2030 will exceed $600 billion, taking the total market to $2.2 trillion. If 
average consumption growth were to return to the rates of the “rising decade” from 2000 to 
2010, consumption would grow by $1.3 trillion, taking the total consumer market on the continent 
to almost $3 trillion.

The consuming class is defined as those with daily spending of $11 or more.

Africa: Opportunities for African 
businesses and governments

Going forward, productivity must be the foundation of economic growth on the continent. 
Africa can no longer rely on growth determined by the vicissitudes of the global demand for 
commodities and export markets. Its complex, multifaceted diversity and thriving demographics 
are assets that can be developed and fostered to support a productivity-led economy. Our 
analysis, together with our work with companies and public agencies across the continent, 
identifies ten practical ways businesses and governments can improve productivity and restore 
economic vitality while bettering the lives of all Africans. 

1.  Pivot from a focus on growth for growth’s sake to a focus on productivity. The continent 
has made an impressive shift from agriculture and extraction to services, yet its productivity 
lags behind that of global peers across all sectors. Restoring the levels of productivity growth 
Africa experienced from 2000 to 2010 would be a good first step, but the continent can go 
even further, given its talent base. Setting targets and tracking not only economic growth but 
also productivity by sector will help African leaders implement and execute concrete plans to 
drive broad-based productivity-led growth.

McKinsey Global Institute | Reimagining economic growth in Africa: Turning diversity into opportunity

47

2.  Fully embrace digital technologies and systems in all areas of the economy. Across all 

sectors, but particularly in services, countries and companies can close the competitiveness 
gap with their emerging-market peers by rapidly deploying digital innovations at scale. Digital 
products and services can enhance customer experience, drive innovations, and improve 
productivity in ways that solve real problems in African societies. More and better data and 
data analytics can help companies identify growth opportunities and tailor offerings across 
a diverse continent where clients and consumers in different countries have differing needs. 
Additionally, building and owning proprietary data analytics is a large opportunity in Africa’s 
data-scarce environment. For governments, leveraging digital can stimulate productivity, 
accelerate economic growth, improve citizen experience, increase revenues, and reduce 
costs and leakages in the system. 

3.  Develop African talent to serve Africa and the world. This is a crucial step to unlocking 

productivity because a highly skilled and enabled workforce can do more with less. Creating 
more relevant educational curricula, training employees to build the skills and knowledge 
Africa needs, linking talent with job opportunities, and empowering entrepreneurs will 
enhance the continent’s workforce and produce next-generation leaders. Local employees 
also understand the specific needs of local customers, which is important given the 
continent’s diversity. Digital skills will be important to develop among the continent’s young 
talent, especially since companies around the world, particularly in countries with aging 
demographics, will increasingly turn to Africa as a source of talent. Indeed, African talent 
could become the continent’s largest export—and given shifts we are seeing in how work 
gets done, this talent may not need to leave the continent to fulfill this demand. 

4.  Reimagine manufacturing for domestic consumption and for export in a competitive 

way. Producing goods for domestic consumption is critical. Countries and companies could 
target promising areas for growth where local and regional demand and the need for self-
sufficiency justify investment, such as agro-processing, vaccine manufacturing, and refining 
of key minerals. However, for Africa’s industrial sector to thrive and see sustainable growth, 
it must improve its productivity and become globally competitive. Africa also could focus on 
growing its share of global manufacturing exports, building on successes like automotive 
exports from Morocco and South Africa. Increasing the addition of value locally to its raw 
minerals before exporting them is one way to achieve this. Building the infrastructure to 
produce more domestically and to enable exports across the continent will also enhance the 
resilience of African companies.

5.  Increase regional connectedness. Africa trades far more with other countries than with 
itself, and increasing intra-Africa trade is critical because it could become a strong driver 
of accelerated growth. Investing to lower costs of transportation and coordinating tariffs 
and regulations across the continent are key enablers of productivity in trade. Having more 
coordinated and aligned strategies across countries and regions, such as pharmaceutical 
manufacturing strategies that span countries in East Africa or West Africa, can build 
resilience and improve productivity. The African Continental Free Trade Area that came into 
force in 2019 presents an important opportunity—and could apply insights from established 
models such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, the European Union, the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and others. Similarly, Africa can better leverage its 
Regional Economic Communities to support collaboration across national boundaries that 
will increase productivity and economic growth.

6.  Invest to enhance resource productivity and tap into new opportunities. While 

exports, productivity, and proportion of value added to the African economy by many 
extractive industries declined from 2010 to 2019, extraction will be a part of the continent’s 
development going forward. Investment is therefore needed, for example in digital 
technologies and automation, to raise the sector’s productivity. More broadly, as the world 
undertakes the energy transition, the types of natural resources it needs are changing, and 
Africa is well positioned to become a significant supplier. The continent’s rich stores of cobalt, 
copper, lithium, and other metals and minerals are already in demand for everything from the 
batteries that power electric vehicles to electric grids. Benefiting from both newly sought-
after and traditional resource exports is, however, not a given. Lessons learned from Africa’s 
historic reliance on extraction can be used to institutionalize best practices and strengthen 
governance to ensure that resource wealth is directed to minimizing the sector’s impact on 
the environment, improving worker safety, and spreading prosperity more broadly throughout 
African society. 

7.  Explore opportunities to benefit from the global net-zero agenda. While climate change 
presents new challenges to growth in Africa, the world’s transition to net zero also brings 
opportunities for the continent, from supplying the minerals we noted previously to green 
hydrogen to green manufacturing and business building in addition to carbon credits. 
Capturing these opportunities will not be trivial, and it will require efforts to structure 
bankable projects, secure capital, and build technical know-how. Countries in Africa are also 
considering their own net-zero trajectories and how to grow their economies by following a 
low-emissions development pathway. Done well, this could deliver benefits such as expanded 
energy access, reduced air pollution, and improved urban and transit mobility in a way that 
is affordable and reliable and supports economic development. However, some substantial 
challenges will need to be carefully managed. The transition should expand energy access in 
a way that is affordable and reliable and supports ongoing economic development. Given the 
strained fiscal headroom of many African countries and the costs and uncertainties of many 
new climate technologies, large-scale support is needed to catalyze capital for investment in 
climate projects and to bolster vulnerable communities whose livelihoods may be affected by 
the net-zero transition. 

8.  Spur the agricultural transition by improving farming productivity. Agriculture provides 

almost half of Africa’s employment and is crucial to the continent’s food security, so 
improving the sector’s productivity is important to lives and livelihoods. Enhanced regional 
communication and collaboration can identify the best locations for growing particular crops 
to improve productivity, coupled with efforts to produce higher-value crops. Rationalization 
of crop production can be complemented with the development of a world-class trading and 
warehousing system to more efficiently reach consumers on the continent as well as in export 
markets. Smart financial solutions making use of futures markets and hedging can support 
such steps and help farmers hedge against climate shocks and global trade disruptions.

9.  Increase and improve urban infrastructure in Africa’s primary and second cities. Africa’s 
largest cities can close significant gaps in urban infrastructure—transportation, power, 
water, and sanitation—through more coherent land use planning that incorporates climate 
adaptation measures and by embracing the use of digital technologies. Public and private 
leadership will be needed to support the development of infrastructure, which will pay off by 
increasing the productivity of urban populations and businesses. Better roads and public 
transportation, for instance, mean less time spent in transit and more time on the job. 

10. Grow and cultivate African business champions. Thriving corporations are key to achieving 
strong economic growth across the continent. Large companies fuel supply chains, attract 
and develop talent, and otherwise contribute to the economies in which they operate in ways 
that can further enhance economic growth and productivity. Efforts to build and support 
business champions on the continent could include plans to “spread the wealth,” since 
today, a big proportion of large companies are based in South Africa. Companies across the 
continent can capture Africa’s $550 billion revenue opportunity over the next decade by 
working to better penetrate existing and new markets, restructuring and reinvesting in their 
portfolios to foster greater productivity, and partnering more effectively with their various 
stakeholders. Governments can nurture industries by putting in place environments that 
enable companies to scale and providing the relevant incentives to support them. As these 
large companies grow, they can better support their supply chains of small and medium-
size enterprises, where the bulk of employment is today, and drive productivity across 
corporate ecosystems.

The time to act is now. Africa’s decision makers in the public and private sectors are faced with 
an unprecedented opportunity to rekindle growth and set the continent back on a path of strong 
sustainable and inclusive development. This will not be easy: it will require innovation, investment, 
and collaboration, particularly given the challenges of climate change and the energy transition 
as well as the ongoing effects of COVID-19 and the global slowdown. But it is an essential 
transformation, for the vitality of the continent and the well-being of the wider world.

By recognizing that there is no “one Africa” but rather an array of diversified and divergent 
strategies for success, leaders can show the way. Governments and businesses across 
the continent can act decisively to maximize Africa’s services opportunity, boost trade and 
industrialization, transform cities, reimagine agriculture, roll back poverty, and build vibrant 
economies. This report is a contribution to that vital endeavor and a clarion call for sustainable, 
inclusive growth.
