Changes to the global grocery retail market are 
happening fast. Trends that emerged during the 
pandemic are persisting, reshaping the industry. 
Consider this: in December 2019, the percentage 
of e-commerce grocery sales in the US market was 
slightly under 4 percent; it’s now in the low teens 
and is expected to reach roughly 25 percent by 
2030. The adoption of online grocery is expected to 
be even higher in parts of Europe.

In this episode of the McKinsey on Consumer and 
Retail podcast, three McKinsey experts share 
insights from their latest research on the global 
grocery retail industry. An edited transcript of their 
conversation with host Monica Toriello follows. 

Monica Toriello: Today we’re going to hear about 
the state of grocery retail all around the world. 
McKinsey’s Retail Practice has undertaken a huge 
research effort that encompassed surveys of more 
than 30,000 consumers and more than 100 grocery 
CEOs globally about what’s happening in grocery 
and what the future of the sector might look like. 
We’ll hear from the regional leaders of this research 
to tell us about what they’re seeing in Asia, Europe, 
and North America. 

First up is Bill Aull, a partner who leads McKinsey’s 
office in Charlotte, North Carolina. Bill has expertise 
in a number of retail and consumer packaged goods 
(CPG) topics, including merchandising, category 
management, and strategy. Bill, thanks for being 
here—and tell us one or two things that you get at 
every trip to the grocery store. For me, it’s seltzer 
water and some kind of dried fruit. What is it for you?

Bill Aull: Great to be here. At the grocery store, I 
always get cream cheese, eggs, and some sort of 
grainy bread.

Monica Toriello: Next up is Dymfke Kuijpers, a 
senior partner who leads our Consumer Practice 
in Asia and our work in consumer tech in the region. 
Dymfke is a Dutch national who’s been based in 
Singapore for the past five years. Dymfke, nice to 
have you with us. And tell us one thing you can’t 
leave the grocery store without.

They’re the best indication of the supply chain of 
the grocer.

Monica Toriello: That’s good to know. Last but 
not least, Daniel Läubli is a senior partner based in 
Zurich. He leads McKinsey’s work in grocery globally 
and coleads our Retail Practice in Europe. His areas 
of expertise include strategy, store operations, and 
advanced analytics. Welcome to the podcast, Daniel, 
and tell us what your grocery must-have is.

Daniel Läubli: Monica, great to be here. My grocery 
must-have is dark Swiss chocolate. I eat at least a 
pack a day, so whenever I go shopping, I need a lot 
of that.

How consumer behavior has changed
Monica Toriello: All of us, to some extent, are 
grocery shoppers; we’re all consumers. So let’s 
start this conversation with the consumer. Broadly 
speaking, when consumers shop for groceries these 
days, they notice that prices are higher. And they’re 
trying to stretch their budgets, so they’ve become 
more value conscious, as your grocery reports have 
said—but you’ve also said they want to eat healthier 
and they care about sustainability. There’s some 
tension between those things, because healthier 
foods and sustainable products tend to be not 
the cheapest options. Bill, let’s start with North 
America: Is the picture that I’ve painted an accurate 
picture of the consumer?

Bill Aull: It is. The bar is raised in terms of what 
grocers have to do to deliver on value, and the 
consumer really isn’t willing to sacrifice what 
they perceive to be value in fresh goods. The 
challenge for many grocers is to figure out how to 
deliver on that. The bar’s higher, and it costs more 
to do business. 

One thing you didn’t mention is that, at least in the 
US, consumers continue to accelerate their demand 
for e-commerce and e-commerce services, which 
adds expense for grocers. That demand is just as 
high as the desire for value and freshness.

Dymfke Kuijpers: Very nice to be here, Monica. I 
never leave the grocery store without stone berries. 

Dymfke Kuijpers: If you look at Asia, we always 
say there’s no such thing as Asia. There are distinct 
countries and big differences in consumer optimism

beginning of the pandemic when people 
were just worried about availability 
of product, people now care big time 
about value.’

and consumer spending, with northern Asia typically 
less optimistic than, say, India. Consumers in India 
are the most optimistic about economic recovery 
after the pandemic and have the highest willingness 
to spend. That said, to your point, inflation is hitting, 
and unlike at the beginning of the pandemic when 
people were just worried about availability of 
product, people now care big time about value. 
That’s number one. 

Number two, to your point about sustainability and 
health, there’s a lot of stated behavior. For example, 
62 percent of Indonesian consumers claim to 
consume products that are healthier and to think 
about their diet and their health when they’re buying 
stuff. I can tell you that was not the case before the 
pandemic. I can also tell you it’s not reflected in 
the actual purchasing behavior just yet. So, there 
is still a disconnect between stated behavior and 
purchasing behavior when it comes to sustainability 
and health.

Third—and I probably should have started with 
this—is e-commerce, which, as Bill mentioned, is a 
big trend. It is really the biggest shift we’ve seen. It 
has penetrated parts of the population that were 
not online—particularly the elderly. And it’s here to 
stay; we don’t see a reversal of people going back to 
the store.

And finally, because of the pandemic a lot of 
consumers had to try new stuff and new brands, 
and they figured out, “Hey, they’re not so bad.” So, 
the ability and the willingness to try new stuff has 
disproportionately grown in the past few years.

Daniel Läubli: In Europe, many of the developments 
Bill mentioned are also evident. Three main trends 
are driving the industry. One is inflation, labor cost 
increases, general cost increases. The second is 
that volumes are lower as we come out of COVID. 
The third is what you mentioned, which is the 
polarization of the consumer. 

What’s happening is that, on the one hand, 
consumers are trading down, becoming more price 
sensitive, and buying more private label, but on 
the other hand they’re buying more sustainable, 
healthy, and premium products—and we see both 
happening at the same time. It’s mainly the lower-
income households that are trading down and 
reducing costs; they are becoming much more 
price sensitive and looking more for promotions 
and cheaper options. But other households are still 
accelerating their spend on healthy and sustainable 
products. So basically, the bottom and the top end 
of the assortment are growing the fastest, while the 
brands in the middle tend to lose.

From browsing the aisles to browsing 
the web
Monica Toriello: Of course, when we talk about 
grocery shoppers, we’re not just talking about 
people standing in a physical store, walking up and 
down the aisles; we’re also talking about online 
shoppers. As you said, online grocery shopping 
skyrocketed during lockdowns, but it’s been pretty 
sticky behavior—people are continuing to do it. 

Daniel, in the more advanced online grocery 
markets in Europe—like the UK, France, and the

big opportunity at the same time. We 
believe that online grocery sales will at 
least double again by 2030.’ 

—Daniel Läubli

Netherlands—your most aggressive forecasts show 
that online could account for up to 30 percent of the 
food-at-home market by 2030. In the most bullish 
scenario for the UK, online grocery with scheduled 
home delivery could be the largest channel in the 
UK by 2030—larger than supermarkets. That is 
astounding. But online is not an easy business for 
grocers, right? Profitability is elusive. What are the 
most important things that grocery retailers need to 
be doing today when it comes to e-commerce? 

Daniel Läubli: Online is indeed a big challenge and 
a big opportunity at the same time. We believe that 
online grocery sales will at least double again by 
2030; in the most aggressive scenario, it will grow 
even more than that. The most important thing for a 
retailer to do is to size this opportunity correctly and 
really go after sales.

Indeed, as you say, profitability is a challenge. There 
are very few players in Europe that have made 
money in grocery e-commerce. There are several 
elements needed to make this work. One is that 
the value proposition online must become much 
more differentiated. While in the past just being 
online was the main offering, we now see players 
offering much more specific value propositions: Is 
it all organic? Is it more local? Is it a convenience 
offering? Online grocery is starting to develop into 
different formats and banners, like what we’ve seen 
happen offline. And we see consumers spreading 
their purchases across several online shops, like 
they do offline as well. It’s important to sharpen the 
value proposition and target a certain customer 
segment and certain shopping occasions.

Operational excellence and automation is another 
important lever to increase profitability. Another one 
is retail media—where the retailers sell advertising 
space on their websites to CPG companies, using 
all the consumer data they have to allow for greater 
targeting. We now see some of the best players 
achieving 10 percent of their online sales through 
these advertising sales, which have become an 
important contributor to their bottom line.

Bill Aull: What’s interesting is that in the US, Canada, 
and Mexico, the development of e-commerce looks 
so different. You mentioned scheduled delivery 
perhaps taking the largest portion of share; that is 
certainly not the trend in the US. Instead, there’s 
a push toward instant delivery. That’s where the 
growth has been. 

You’re seeing the merger of grocery delivery with 
the DoorDashes and the Grubhubs of the world. 
Many grocers in the US are now having to face the 
decision of, “Do we try to build this ourselves? Or 
who do we partner with?” During the pandemic, a 
significant number of grocers accelerated their 
partnerships with Instacart and Shipt and others. 
They’re taking a step back now to say, “As we think 
about where this goes, how much of this do I want 
to own and how much do I want to have a partner 
lead for me?” Who owns the customer data? And 
who controls the customer experience? Because, 
ultimately, that’s a big portion of the repeat traffic 
and loyalty that we see in the US. 

Just to ground us in the facts: in the US, online 
penetration in December 2019, before the 
pandemic, was about 3.9 percent. It’s now in the low

can be offered to them?’

teens. And while we don’t see it getting to the level 
that Daniel alluded to in Europe by 2030, it’s not 
significantly behind: mid-20s is what we expect to 
see in the US. And, again, it raises a lot of questions 
about how to deliver on it profitably: Is now the time 
to rethink your supply chain? It’s been a fascinating 
journey and I think it really is the battleground that 
will shape the sector for the next five years. 

I think it’s fascinating, too, to see how many 
grocers are inserting themselves into new markets 
without a brick-and-mortar presence. There are 
a number of grocers doing that. The competitive 
landscape is going to evolve dramatically; it’ll be 
fascinating to watch.

Dymfke Kuijpers: As for Asia, it’s very different by 
country. If I take China, for example, the majority of 
sales are in the next-30-minutes category. There’s 
some next-day, but most are in the 30-minute 
delivery window. It’s a very different model from the 
classic grocery basket in supermarkets, or even 
from same-day delivery, on which you can make a 
decent margin.

There are a couple of things to watch. One, for sure, 
is media monetization: we see the big players very 
aggressively moving there, and the tech players 
are already there. A second area is around supply 
chain, as Bill mentioned. Traditionally, labor has not 
been expensive in many countries in Asia, but now 
it’s becoming so. How do you organize that? How do 
you make your supply chain more resilient to fit your 
omnichannel model?

Another piece of this is the huge surge in data-
driven systems of personalization and, related to 
that, loyalty. This is in part driven by the unique 
“Asian-ness” of super apps. With so many different 
apps, traditional grocery players are saying, “How 
do we compete against these super apps? How do 
we create our own ecosystems and put together a 
loyalty system where we can create a reinforcing 
loop, so that customers come to us more often?”

By and large, quite a lot of the Asian retailers are 
still struggling to make money in online sales. I 
think they’re less developed, from that perspective, 
compared to grocers in Europe.

Bill Aull: What’s interesting, Dymfke, is that 
everyone’s asking what’s happening in Asia with the 
super apps and whether that’s what we should be 
doing in the US. There are probably some learnings 
around what’s working versus not, and how that 
would translate to the US.

Dymfke Kuijpers: I’d also say that most retailers 
in Asia are actually no longer just retailers. They’re 
also payments and fintech players. They’re often 
also CPG producers. They also have an advertising 
business or media business. They go into gaming. 
The “state of grocery” in China, to a certain extent, 
doesn’t exist anymore from an industry perspective.

Investing in talent
Monica Toriello: Let’s talk about labor and talent, 
which each of you has brought up. It’s a huge issue 
in retail: we’re seeing rising attrition, employees 

5

The state of grocery retail around the worlddemanding more flexibility, automation changing the 
types of skills that retailers need, and so on. We can 
point to many examples of things that retailers are 
already doing on the talent front, whether it’s higher 
hourly wages, tuition reimbursement, reskilling 
and upskilling programs, or offering distinct career 
paths to attract digital talent. But what are you 
seeing that’s actually working? 

Bill Aull: I do think that is one of the biggest 
challenges. In the grocery sector, there’s not a long 
list right now that you could point to and say, “Look, 
this is what everyone should be doing.” There’s a 
lot of trial and error. And I would think separately 
about what’s happening to make corporate 
centers attractive, versus what’s happening to 
make distribution centers attractive, versus what’s 
happening to make stores attractive. 

In stores, what’s been interesting to see are folks 
rethinking the value proposition for the department 
manager in produce or in meat, or for the person 
driving the customer experience desk. To your point, 
there’s always been a lot of attrition, particularly at 
the front desk, checkout, and other “daily tasking” 
roles—but what drives the performance of a store 
are department managers. 

So there have been folks looking at store managers 
and department managers, and thinking creatively 
about their career paths: What are the step-out 
roles or special projects that can be offered to 
them? What are the ways they can learn and develop 
through offline learning and training that broaden 
their skill set beyond just the core of what they’re 
doing today?

Daniel Läubli: When we ask CEOs what their top 
concerns are, finding the right talent comes out as 
number two, directly after inflation. When we asked 
the same question last year, talent was not even in 
the top ten. Also, when you look at job vacancies in 
the European Union in retail, they’re at a record high. 
It’s really difficult to find enough talent and the right 
talent. This includes traditional roles like butchers, 
bakers, and store associates, but also newer roles 
like in IT or analytics. In all of these roles, there are 
not enough people and attrition is at a record high.

Many retailers reacted in recent months by offering 
higher pay and compensating for inflation to 
increase the buying power of their employees. But 
what we find in our research is that higher pay is 
only part of it, and it’s actually not what makes 
people stay.

What makes people stay is if they have an 
environment where they like to work, if they get 
along well with their boss, if they feel a sense 
of belonging, and if they have good career 
opportunities, as Bill mentioned. I’ve seen retailers 
start to offer training programs for their department 
managers and store managers on how to lead and 
how to improve. It’s not the solution to everything, 
but it’s one of the most interesting things I’ve seen 
so far.

Dymfke Kuijpers: I wouldn’t say we’ve particularly 
cracked that in Asia. In some Asian markets, there’s 
still more labor available than in Europe and the 
US. That being said, what we see here, interestingly 
enough, is that some of the best practices are 
coming from the “hyperscalers.” They have 
programs around how to lead with purpose, how to 
scale fast, how to foster a founder’s mindset. 

If I started with two people five years ago and we’re 
now thousands of people, how do I create purpose? 
What is my purpose as a company, and how do I get 
everybody excited around that? How do I then make 
that practical, in the values and in the fabric of the 
company and in how we work, so that I empower the 
next generation?

Where grocery goes next
Monica Toriello: You’ve interviewed many CEOs for 
these reports, and you counsel many of them on a 
daily basis. What is the one message that you’d give 
today’s grocery CEOs? If they do only one thing in 
2022, what should that one thing be?

Daniel Läubli: They should make bold moves to 
adapt their commercial offering to the current 
environment. We are seeing dramatic shifts, such 
as the polarization of consumers. Players that are 
making bold moves in strengthening their offering—
for people who are looking to save money as well 
as for people who want to pay more for premium-

The state of grocery retail around the worldquality, sustainable, healthy products—will come out 
much stronger.

Bill Aull: My simple answer is to invest in your 
people. There’s such a pull for talent. Given all the 
things that Daniel and Dymfke have described in 
terms of evolution of the industry, there’s a lot of 
leadership needed in this sector. I’d encourage 
everybody to invest in all parts of their organizations, 
from the corporate centers to the store managers 
and store employees. That’s my big message.

Dymfke Kuijpers: I was going to say something 
similar: invest in capabilities. Invest in digital 
capabilities and the related “cool” stuff around retail 
media, but also in core capabilities like cost savings, 
private-brand development, and store operations. 

What I feel very excited about is the speed at which 
new businesses get built. These things go so fast—
from zero to a first version in three months, and 
then a full-fledged business in 12 months. I would 
say that’s where Asia has something to teach the 
rest of the world: the speed at which things go. 
Last year, I was talking to a retailer about retail 
media being 1 percent of their business. This year, 
it’s 4 percent. I can tell you that’s a speed that I 
never see in the rest of the world.

Bill Aull: Maybe the last thing I would say is that 
Europe has been so far ahead on private label, but 
what we’re seeing now in the US is that it’s not 
just about introducing a cheaper national-brand 

equivalent, but actually, “How do we differentiate 
our stores with a new program or platform that’s 
in the middle tier or premium tier for private 
label?” That’s going to be a fascinating space that 
transpires in North America over the next two years.

Dymfke Kuijpers: The next big category for 
retailers is alternative proteins. It’s a massive thing. 
It’s currently very local—tastes continue to be local—
so retailers, just like in ready-to-eat and ready-to-
cook meals, will play an incredibly big role in shaping 
that category. It’s still very early days in this part of 
the world but I think that will be something to watch 
out for.

Daniel Läubli: I fully agree. Alternative proteins are 
the next battlefield. What people often don’t know 
is that the food system makes up about 34 percent 
of the total greenhouse-gas emissions globally, and 
most of it comes from meat and dairy. 

We see a lot going on in Europe—a lot of start-ups 
in the field. There are grocers acquiring alternative 
protein producers to start building this as a 
differentiation factor. To Dymfke’s point, this is 
indeed one of the next big waves. It’s becoming 
the next fruit-and-vegetable category: we always 
say fruits and vegetables are the big differentiator, 
and alternative proteins could be the next one of 
that magnitude.
