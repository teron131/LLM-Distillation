The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Introduction: The power of private 
markets—and a look at the talent driving it

When you think of the global economy, several 
leading public companies or the various stock 
exchanges likely spring to mind. Less likely to 
come to mind are the numerous institutional 
investors (IIs) or private equity (PE) firms that 
back thousands of companies around the world. 
Private capital is quietly powerful. The private 
markets industry has almost $10 trillion in assets 
under management (AUM), which is more than 
the GDP of every country except two—China and 
the United States.1 About 9,200 PE firms and IIs 
invest in or control many privately held companies 
around the world.2 The sheer scale and influence 
that PE and IIs have over businesses globally 
makes it relevant to understand the composition 
of the employee base driving the deployment of so 
much capital. 

This report examines to what extent IIs factor in 
the diversity of deal teams when allocating funds 
and explores II sentiment on the state of diversity 
in PE today. Examining the current baseline for 
PE firms on gender diversity globally and on 
ethnicity and race in Canada and the United 
States, we outline a few levers driving current-
state representation numbers, such as promotion, 
attrition, and external hiring, and conclude with 
recommendations that leaders in the industry 
can consider and further tailor by their geography 
or organization. These findings highlight 
the importance of diversity of talent in PE, as well 
as the progress made over the course of 2021, and 
provide clear areas of opportunity as the industry 
continues to prioritize diversity, equity, and 
inclusion (DEI) (for more on our research, see 
sidebar “About the study”).

About the study 

Our inaugural report, The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022, builds on prior 
McKinsey research on diversity in the workplace to explore diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 
in the global private markets industry, with a focus on private equity (PE) firms and institutional 
investors (IIs). This aims to be the largest study of gender diversity and ethnic and racial diversity 
in the global private markets industry. We launched this research to shed light on the state of 
diversity in the industry and to help advance the industry’s progress toward diversity goals. We 
surveyed 42 PE firms and IIs around the world and conducted interviews with several industry 
leaders to supplement the data we received from these firms. Participating PE firms directly 
employ more than 60,000 people globally. We also used scenarios to learn about the role of 
diversity in IIs’ capital allocation decisions. Our inaugural findings focus on capturing the current 
state of gender diversity and ethnic and racial diversity in PE. 

Analysis of the survey data uncovered three key insights for the industry: a view of IIs’ assessment 
of diversity on investing deal teams today; IIs’ preference toward more diverse deal teams when 
allocating capital to PE firms; and today’s baseline of diversity for PE investing teams—in terms 
of gender diversity for the Americas, Asia–Pacific (APAC), and Europe and in terms of ethnic and 
racial diversity for Canada and the United States. Given data collection limitations, this report 
remained largely focused on gender diversity and ethnic and racial diversity within PE firms. We 
recognize there are several other categories that contribute to the diversity of employees. Future 
reports hope to broaden the categories examined, as well as expand to include PE firm portfolio 
companies, among other segments within private markets. The inaugural survey findings highlight 
the importance to IIs of having diverse talent in PE and the progress the PE industry as a whole 
has made over the course of 2021. It also provides clear areas of focus as the industry continues to 
prioritize DEI.

Institutional 
investors as catalysts 
for change 

Institutional investors (IIs) can have an impact on the diversity of the industry. 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is increasingly important to the constituents of 
several major endowments and pension funds, which has prompted IIs to pay close 
attention to PE funds’ diversity metrics. Early data suggests that IIs generally prefer 
to invest in PE funds with more diverse investment teams, even if it means sometimes 
allocating capital to a firm with lower historical performance. Further, PE respondents 
confirmed that they have been sharing more—and a wider variety of—diversity data 
(for more, see sidebar “Institutional investors in the private market ecosystem”). 

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Institutional investors’ mixed feelings 
about PE’s progress on DEI 

decide this matters. Based on our study, it seems 
they do. 

With many pension funds and educational 
endowments in their ranks, some IIs have 
expressed that they view themselves as 
the conscience of the private market industry. 

As key players in private markets, and given 
the amount of capital IIs allocate annually to PE 
firms, IIs could be a real catalyst for change on 
topics such as diversity of talent in PE—if they 

The consensus among IIs is that the state of 
diversity in PE today is poor. IIs believe that PE 
firms have significant opportunity to improve 
the representation of underrepresented 
groups on their investing teams, specifically 
on the dimensions of gender, ethnicity and 
race, socioeconomic background, and sexual 
orientation (Exhibit 1).

Institutional investors in the private market ecosystem 

“Institutional investors” (IIs) is a broad term used to describe a range of types of companies that manage assets of groups, 
typically by allocating capital to various investment vehicles to grow value over time. Here, we use the term II to include, among 
others, state or local pensions (for example, for teachers or police), sovereign wealth funds, private family offices, foundations, 
endowments, real estate funds, lenders, growth or expansion funds, hedge funds, and venture funds.

These IIs often directly allocate capital to various private equity (PE) firms when they are raising funds for a new tranche of 
investments. These funds often have specific themes (for example, buyout)—and, at times, even a strategic focus (which could 
be based, for instance, on industry or geography)—for the companies they will deploy this capital to.

Since PE funds raise significant capital from IIs, they are motivated to align their actions and strategies to IIs’ priorities, 
especially during capital raises. Data PE funds provide during fundraising can range from past funds’ performance to 
the talent composition of investment teams and firms’ investment committees.

7

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022IIs signaled that PE firms could do more to 
diversify their investment committees (ICs) and 
the management teams at the helm of portfolio 
companies where they hold majority ownership. 
When asked about their satisfaction with PE 
firms’ actions to improve talent diversity within 
their firms and among portfolio companies, IIs’ 
responses varied (Exhibit 2). 

On average, II’s were lukewarm on the actions 
being taken, with a wide range of perspectives 

at each end. IIs were most satisfied with actions 
PE firms are taking to improve diversity on their 
investment teams. The lowest level of satisfaction 
was related to the diversity of PE firms’ ICs, 
which draw from the ranks of managing directors 
(MDs), and the C-suite. When it comes to PE 
firms’ approach to their portfolio companies, 
IIs’ satisfaction is lowest on management team 
diversity, with a slight increase in satisfaction with 
actions taken to improve board-level diversity.

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Institutional investors’ preference for 
diverse teams and allocation decisions

While the sample size of IIs was small, our data 
suggest that the diversity premium can be 
significant in some scenarios. We asked ten 
chief investment officers or their equivalent, 
representing IIs with assets under management 
(AUM) ranging from $20 billion to $460 billion, to 
allocate $100 million between two hypothetical PE 
funds. When the hypothetical firms had identical 
metrics except for the investing team’s diversity, IIs 
would allocate, on average, twice as much capital 
to the deal team with more gender diversity and 

2.6 times as much to the team with more ethnic 
and racial diversity (Exhibit 3). 

Not only would the more diverse deal team 
receive more money (all else equal), the data also 
suggested that a penalty may exist for lagging 
behind peers on talent diversity: one out of 
the ten IIs reported that they would not allocate 
any funding to the less diverse PE fund when 
the alternate funds’ historical performance was 
the same.

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Data from our survey also suggest that IIs prefer 
firms that they have allocated funding to in 
the past. However, diversity can boost the amount 
of capital allocated to unfamiliar firms when two 
firms have the same historic performance. IIs 
allocated an average of 1.3 times as much capital 
to unfamiliar funds with more gender diversity 
than to funds they previously allocated to but 
that had less gender diversity on their deal teams 
(Exhibit 4).

Similarly, firms with higher levels of ethnic and 
racial diversity enjoyed a diversity premium even 
when they were unfamiliar to an II. Unfamiliar but 
more diverse firms were awarded an average of 
1.6 times as much capital as familiar firms with 

less diversity. However, IIs’ preference for firms 
they have allocated to in the past was significant 
enough that no respondents said they would 
allocate 100 percent of their capital to the less 
familiar firm on the basis of the deal team’s 
greater diversity. 

However, a minority of respondents—about 
40 percent regarding gender and 40 percent 
regarding ethnicity and race—allocated the same 
amount of capital to PE funds, seemingly without 
regard to the level of diversity on those deal teams. 
This seems to suggest that some CIOs preferred to 
diversify their investments across firms rather than 
by the demographic diversity of investment teams.

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Surprisingly, in a scenario where the diversity 
leader lagged on historic performance, 40 percent 
of IIs still allocated more capital to the PE firm 
with greater gender diversity, in spite of its lower 
historic returns; 50 percent of IIs allocated more 
to the firm with lower historic returns but higher 
ethnic and racial diversity (Exhibit 5).

Given the data challenges of gathering and 
comparing apples-to-apples metrics from all 
firms, it is too soon to quantify the extent to which 
this is occurring today in IIs’ actual allocating. 
However, responses from surveyed IIs suggest 
that diversity matters to these firms and that 
they are willing to allocate accordingly if PE firms 
provide comparative diversity data and historic 
fund performance.

intensive for PE firms. The lack of standard, 
defined DEI metrics in the private markets industry 
complicates IIs’ efforts to compare firms’ DEI 
practices. PE firms submit lengthy and often 
allocator-specific forms that ask for varying types 
of data. Meanwhile, IIs receive a large volume of 
data—a mix of facts, metrics, and narrative that is 
difficult to compare across PE firms.

Even if PE firms’ DEI metrics are modest, for now, 
IIs seem satisfied if the PE firm can share its plans 
for improving DEI performance. One director of 
ESG at a small US-headquartered PE firm said, 
“Sometimes talking about what you are doing 
on DEI feels more important to [institutional 
investors] than the actual metrics. We always 
share details on the programs we have in place in 
addition to the template of metrics.” A combination 
of quantitative and qualitative data helps IIs 
evaluate PE firms more holistically. PE executives 
note that diversity metrics take time to improve. As 
the head of HR for a US PE firm noted, “It’s going 
to take time to move these numbers. From entry-
level, the fastest possible course up through our 
firm to MD [managing director] within the investing 
track is eight years, and that’s if you are on 
the fastest career trajectory possible.” 

The main challenge for both the IIs and PE firms 
is a lack of standardized metrics, which makes 
the reporting process unwieldy and labor-

Standardizing diversity metrics will take time. 
However, it is clear that IIs are increasingly 
considering PE investing teams’ diversity metrics 
and initiatives in capital allocation decisions. 
Will Goodwin, head of direct investments at New 
Zealand Super Fund, said, “When we look to 
allocate, we ask PE funds for statistics on DEI, 
such as gender pay gap and representation. In our 
opinion, programs like parental leave are just good 
hygiene and table stakes these days.”

As the head of DEI at a midsize US PE firm said, “I 
am a big proponent of the need to streamline and 
consolidate what we are asked to report. It is hard 
for organizations like ours to respond to so many 
requests for different data in different forms.” As 
a result, PE firms often send the metrics they have 
available. Meanwhile, IIs are left to wade through 
a mix of data from multiple PE firms that is difficult 
to compare and therefore often not able to be 
used in allocation decision making.

Gender diversity 
in global private 
equity

In this section, we discuss the current state of gender representation in the industry, 
particularly in investing roles in different regions. Although there is a popular 
assumption that the PE world is completely male dominated, the evidence does not 
always bear this out. Globally, PE firms have almost achieved gender parity in entry-
level roles (Exhibit 7). 

On average, as of the end of 2021, 48 percent of all entry-level roles—and 33 percent 
of all roles—in PE globally are filled by women (for more on job levels, see sidebar 
“Job levels in private equity”). However, women in PE are still underrepresented in 
leadership positions—dropping from 48 percent at entry level (L6) to only 20 percent 
at managing director (MD) roles (L2).

In descending order of seniority, the roles are as follows:

L1

L2

L3

C-level executives or fund 
heads. We refer to this level 
as the C-level or C-suite.

Managing directors or partners.

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Combining investing and 
non-investing roles obscures 
important nuances

Statistics such as the one about near gender 
parity at the entry level are based on a full-firm 
perspective that combines investing staff with 
non-investing staff. However, the firmwide data on 
gender representation obscure important nuance. 
While the ratio of non-investing to investing staff 
varies based on the size of the firm, full-firm 
gender diversity tends to be higher than gender 
diversity in investing roles. Indeed, disaggregating 
this figure into investing and non-investing 
employees reveals that only 34 percent of entry-
level investing roles are held by women, compared 
to 57 percent in non-investing entry-level roles, 
and that women in PE are still underrepresented in 
leadership positions—dropping from 34 percent at 

entry-level investing (L6) to only 12 percent at MD 
investing roles (L2). 

Overall, women’s representation within PE is 
driven by women in non-investing roles at all 
levels: women hold 52 percent of non-investing 
roles and only 23 percent of investing roles overall 
(Exhibit 8).

Among responding firms, 39 to 57 percent of non-
investing roles—from the entry level (L6) up to 
the MD level (L2)—were held by women, compared 
to only 12 to 34 percent of investment roles. 

It is valuable to examine investing roles separately 
because in PE firms—and many other types of 
private market firms—an unspoken hierarchy often 
exists. Examining the gender composition for 
investing and non-investing staff separately can 
help illuminate a firm’s cultural dynamics.

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Positive strides in gender diversity for 
PE investing over 2021

Over the course of 2021 alone, global PE made 
modest strides toward diversifying gender 
representation in investing roles. 

In investing roles, the share of women employees 
grew by two percentage points in 2021, driven 
mostly by a nine percentage point increase in 
women at the entry level. 

However, women in PE continue to face obstacles 
to their career advancement. The share of 
minorities (on the dimensions of gender, ethnicity 
and race, or an intersection) within PE investing 
teams declines with seniority (Exhibit 9). 

Globally, women shift from representing slightly 
more than a fourth of investing associates (L5) 
to just over one out of every nine investing 
professionals by the MD level (L2).

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Remaining challenges for  
senior-level women

One consequence of the observed downward 
trajectory in representation is that even senior-
level women struggle to break into “the room 
where it happens” in PE: today, women are only 
9 percent of IC members (which typically draws 
from L1 and L2 employees), despite making up 
about 12 percent of MD-level investment staff (L2) 
and 14 percent of C-suite roles (L1) (Exhibit 10). 

The fact that women’s representation on 
investment committees (ICs) is lower than their 
presence in these senior ranks (L1 and L2) may 
reveal an unspoken cultural dynamic in which 
women are still not in the same positions of 
power as 91 percent of their male counterparts, 
even at the MD or C-suite levels. (For more on 
the role of ICs, see sidebar “The role of investment 
committees in the private equity industry.”)

A possible outcome—and contributor—to senior-
level women’s challenges is lower job satisfaction. 
Analysis of job satisfaction data from employees 
who participated in our survey suggests that White 
or Caucasian (hereafter “White”) women in middle 
management and senior executive positions have 
the lowest job satisfaction of all intersectional 
(that is, gender and ethnic/racial) groups in their 
investing level. Indeed, White women in senior 
investing positions are 13 percent less satisfied 
than their male counterparts and 1.4 times more 
likely to leave in the next year. They are also 
the least likely to say that they feel their voices 
are valued by their organizations. This sentiment 
persists among women in entry-level investing 
roles, who report being 3 times more likely to leave 
than their male counterparts. 

Globally, gender diversity in investing, particularly 
at the senior levels of PE firms, has room for 
improvement. Yet even today there is a significant

The role of investment committees 
in the private equity industry 

In private equity (PE), investment committees (ICs) are where investment decisions 
happen. Firms often take pride in their IC process. ICs engage in intellectual debate 
and make decisions about potential assets to purchase, prices to pay, the level of 
EBITDA growth needed over the holding period, and how to create that value.

While several other operations—such as raising new funds or setting investment 
strategies—are of comparable importance, the discussions and decisions made 
in regular IC meetings form the intellectual backbone of PE firms. Therefore, who 
consistently sits at the IC table matters.

Standing IC members are generally invited from the C-suite (L1) and MD (L2) ranks.

spread among PE firms that lead on gender 
diversity and those that trail. When looking at 
the MD level (L2), the top 10 percent of PE firms 
on gender diversity average 32 percent investing 
women MDs, while the bottom 10 percent of firms 
in 2021 had no investing women MDs (Exhibit 11). 

What’s more, female representation at the top 
seems to affect gender diversity throughout 
the organization: PE firms that lead on percent of 
women MDs also had significantly higher shares 
of total investing women versus the industry as 
a whole—a difference of ten percentage points 
higher than the industry average of 23 percent.

gender diversity

While the dynamics of the PE industry as a whole 
may affect the number of investing women, 
regional variations also exist, affecting different 
levels within the PE hierarchy (Exhibit 12). 

The Americas have the highest share of women 
in the C-suite and possibly the least obstacles to 
female advancement, with the smallest drop-off 
in share of women from associate (L5) to MD (L2); 
Asia–Pacific (APAC) leads the regions in women’s 
representation in the middle of the corporate 
ladder (L4); and Europe leads slightly on entry-
level investing roles (L6).

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022PE offices in the Americas have a low share 
of women in entry- and associate-level 
investing roles
PE offices in the Americas lead the regions 
on many dimensions of diversity. Americas 
offices boast the highest share of women in 
top-of-the-house roles: the share of women 
in the equivalent of the C-suite is 15 percent. 
Moreover, of the regions, offices in the Americas 
have the smallest drop today (12 percentage 
points) between the share of women in investing at 
the associate level (L5, at 25 percent) and the MD 
level (L2, at 13 percent).3 However, the region also 
ties with APAC for the lowest share of women at 
the entry level (L6), and with Europe for the lowest 
share at post-MBA associate (L5) levels. 

Like the rest of the world, gender parity on 
promotions is lacking and there is often higher 
promotion rates among men in investing roles. In 

the Americas, the promotion rate for men into VP, 
principal, and MD or partner ranges from five to 
12 percentage points higher than for women.

Moreover, the Americas are losing more women 
than men at all levels other than the C-Suite. 
Women’s attrition in the Americas is most 
noticeable at the associate and VP levels, 
where the attrition rate for women is 13 and six 
percentage points higher, respectively, than 
for men (for more, see sidebar “Understanding 
promotion rates, attrition rates, and external hiring 
shares”) (Exhibit 13).

While American PE does comparatively well with 
retention and promotion of investing women at 
junior levels, this small base of women entering 
the profession may constrain progress in 
the ability to advance a greater share of women to 
MD over time.

3 In PE, unlike in some other corporate cultures, associate level (L5) is a significant entry point for post-MBA investing professionals. A far 
greater percentage of L5 individuals remain at firms to L2, as compared to L6 in PE, which on the Investing side is seen more as a two- to 
three-year position. Therefore, in this report L5 to L2 is often used as an anchor to show representation longitudinally.

Understanding promotion 
rates, attrition rates, and 
external hiring shares

In this report, we use rates and shares to quantify the extent 
to which people of different groups are promoted, leaving 
(voluntarily and involuntarily), and externally hired. 

The promotion rate reflects promotions into the level. 
A promotion rate of 0 percent indicates that there were 
members of the group at the beginning of the year who 
could have been promoted into the next level, but none 
were promoted over the course of 2021. Meanwhile, a rate 
of 100 percent suggests that everyone at the lower level 
at the start of 2021 was promoted into the next level over 
the course of 2021.

The attrition rate is a ratio underscoring how many members 
of a group left over the course of 2021 relative to how many 
members were in that group at the start of 2021. An attrition 
rate of 0 percent means no one left, while an attrition rate of 
100 percent means everyone left.

An external hiring share of 0 percent indicates that no one 
from a given group was externally hired. 

These measures indicate movement in and out of roles—
promotion, attrition, and hiring—and do not measure 
equitable representation. 

23

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022APAC offices have the highest share of women 
in mid-level roles
APAC leads in share of women investors at 
post-MBA associate (L5) and VP (L4) ranks. 
Representation for women at the associate level 
(L5) in APAC offices is 31 percent, five percentage 
points higher than the global benchmark, and 
representation for women at the VP level (L4) 
is 40 percent, 11 percentage points higher than 
the global benchmark. 

In every region, there is a sizable step down in 
the share of women at or above principal (L3). 
However, 2021 data show a “broken rung” in 
the career progression for women in APAC 
offices, with the share of women plunging by 
more than 30 percentage points in the step up 
from VP (L4) to principal (L3); that is a 4.2 times 
drop in the percentage of women advancing to 
principal (L3) in APAC offices. This broken rung 
for women from VP to principal was made more 
severe by a promotion gap between women and 
men (2 percent of women versus 20 percent of 
men from the available pool promoted) in 2021 
and attrition of women at the L3 level in APAC 
(Exhibit 14).

Though most pronounced in APAC, the plunge 
between midlevel roles and more senior roles is 
also visible in Europe and the Americas. In both 
Europe and the Americas, women in investing 
lost nine percentage points of share in the step 
up from VP to principal and six percentage points 

from principal to MD. As a result, women make 
up 13 percent of MD roles in the Americas and 
7 percent in Europe. However, different factors 
influenced these drops in representation over 
the course of 2021 in European and American 
offices. In the Americas, the drop in share from 
VP to principal, similar to APAC, was affected by 
a gap in promotion parity into the principal level 
(17 percent of women VPs versus 29 percent 
of men VPs were promoted). In Europe, while 
men were still promoted at a higher rate than 
women, the gap to parity was smaller (18 percent 
of women VPs versus 22 percent of men VPs 
were promoted). 

European offices have the highest share of 
women at entry-level investing
Europe leads the regions, though marginally, 
in women in entry-level investing jobs, 
with 35 percent. However, women in 
Europe at the MD level (L2) have the lowest 
representation—7 percent—compared to all 
other regions and the steepest decline from 
post-MBA associate level, with a 17 percentage 
point drop from L5 to L2. Given that more than 
a third of entry-level investing staff are women, 
European PE offices have a real opportunity to 
increase their gender diversity at higher levels by 
analyzing sponsorship throughout the funnel and 
promotion rates of women out of the entry-level 
investing role.

However, there are positive signs. In 2021, 
Europe had the smallest gap compared with 
other regions between promotion rates for men 
and women at the mid-level to senior ranks. Even 
though promotions still favor men, in Europe, 
the difference in promotion rates between men 
and women into VP and principal roles is less than 
four percentage points. 

Perhaps surprisingly, in Europe in 2021, four times 
as many women MDs in investing left their firms as 
men did. It is possible, though, that they were not 
leaving the industry, given that external hiring into 
the MD role was also higher in Europe (and APAC) 
than in the Americas.

Key levers affecting diversity 
Promotion, attrition, and hiring, are important 
elements of diversity at every level of PE. While 
these three levers are not exhaustive, they 
are the most common and accessible ones for 
decision makers. 

When it comes to promotions, with a few 
exceptions, globally men were promoted at 
higher rates in all regions in PE investing in 2021. 
The exceptions were in APAC into VP (L4) and 
MD (L2), where promotion rates for the available 
pool of women associates and principals were at 
or above 20 percent, as compared to their male 
peers who saw a 16 and 6 percent promotion 
rate into the respective levels. The Americas also 

promoted men and women into the associate level 
(L5) at roughly parity (about 27 percent) in 2021. 

While our data set showed that APAC had 
more favorable promotion rates for investing 
women in a few areas, investing women in APAC 
also had the largest gaps to promotion parity 
at other levels—namely into associate (L5) 
(where 57 percent of men but only 18 percent of 
women were promoted) and into principal (L3) 
(20 percent men but only 2 percent women). 
Also, the Americas in 2021 promoted men into 
VP and principal roles with gaps in the rate of 
promotion of ten to 13 percentage points, as 
previously described.

In terms of attrition and external hiring—while 
our data set does not track individuals across 
companies and therefore is unable to say if 
individuals leaving their firms are the same that 
are being hired into similar or senior levels at 
other PE firms, we noted a few trends in the past 
year. In both Europe and the Americas, women 
at every level left at higher rates than their male 
counterparts, and external hiring in PE investing 
roles for women in those regions and APAC was 
lower than men across the board. While attrition 
rates for investing men and women generally 
decline with seniority, about 11 to 12 percent of 
investing women principals and MDs in European 
offices (and 20 percent in APAC offices) left 
their firms in 2021. As previously discussed, 

25

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022the lack of gender diversity at the top seems to 
influence the retention of diversity at all levels 
of the investing team, so this exodus of senior-
level women in 2021 may warrant attention from 
the industry (Exhibit 15).

Chief human resources officers (CHROs) are 
focused on recruiting women for these senior 
roles, but they admit it can be challenging. 
Elizabeth Urdang, CHRO at L Catterton, said, “Our 
firm has been focused on increasing diversity in 
all functions for many years. One thing we have 
learned is that when working with search firms 
we need to explicitly ask for diverse talent for 
our open roles. If we tell the search firm anything 
different, if we give them any wiggle room to 
bring us non-diverse talent, then we don’t get any 
diverse talent at all.” 

PE firms globally are also using MBA recruitment 
as an opportunity to increase the representation 
of women (and other minority populations) in 

investing at the associate (L5) level. The CHRO of 
one small to midsize PE firm said, “We do a good 
job on gender diversity, but that doesn’t mean 
we can take the eye off the ball. Looking more 
broadly, we are partnering with business schools 
and their LGBTQ+ clubs and their Black investing 
clubs to find new ways of attracting diverse talent.” 

Given the time it takes to apprentice and promote 
individuals from associate up to MD, these 
shifts over a course of one year do not explain 
the entirety of the composition we see in PE 
investing. However, it is a window into the levers 
at a PE firm’s disposal and a helpful indication of 
the direction these firms are taking on diversity 
of their talent. (For a nuanced look at women 
in investing roles at firms headquartered in 
the Americas and Europe, see sidebar “The 
relationship between headquarter location 
and culture.”)

A view of ethnic 
and racial diversity 
in private equity

For our analysis on ethnic and racial diversity in PE, we leveraged data from the PE 
firms with offices in Canada and the United States due to the ease and frequency with 
which offices in those geographies collected these data. We will discuss the overall 
state of ethnic and racial diversity in PE investing then dive into how Asian, Black, and 
Hispanic, Latino, and mestizo professionals fare in the industry. 

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Ethnic and racial successes and 
challenges parallel those of women in 
the industry

Our research suggests that over the course of 
2021, ethnic and racial minorities in the industry 
have experienced similar successes and 
challenges as women in the PE industry. 
Specifically, non-investing roles have higher 
shares of ethnic and racial diversity than investing 
roles do. Thirty-three percent of non-investing 
roles (compared to 30 percent of investing 
roles) were held by ethnic and racial minorities in 
the Canadian and US offices of PE firms at the end 
of 2021.

Based on data from PE firms’ offices in Canada 
and the United States, like women, ethnic and 
racial minorities (including people of Asian 
descent) in investing compose only 9 percent of 
IC members even though they make up almost 
17 percent of MDs (L2). Women of color only hold 
about 1 percent of IC roles even though they are 
four times as prevalent at the L2 level (Exhibit 16). 

The experiences of ethnic and racial minority 
investing professionals differed from that of 
investing women in a few ways. In Canada and 
the United States, ethnic and racial minorities’ 
representation in entry-level investing roles was 
six percentage points higher than for women at 
that level: 40 percent of entry-level investing staff 
identified as ethnic and racial minorities, while 
34 percent identified as women. At the top of 
organizations, women see a two percentage point 
boost in representation between the MD level (L2) 
and the C-suite (L1). However, ethnic and racial 
minorities have a harder time making the same 
jump, losing five percentage points between 
the two levels (from 17 percent to 12 percent). 

Over the course of 2021, the share of investing 
roles in Canada and the United States held by 
people who self-identified as White declined by 
one percentage point to 70 percent. The share 
of investing professionals of Asian and Hispanic 
descent stayed roughly constant at 21 percent 
and 4 percent, respectively. Black investing staff 
gained one percentage point in share to end 
the year at 3 percent.

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022White professionals in PE

White professionals remain the largest group in 
investing roles in Canada and the United States, 
and they gain ground at successive job levels from

Data for 2021 show that people who self-identified 
as White held 70 percent of all investing jobs 

and 58 percent of Associate (L5) investing roles. 
From associate to MD (L2), representation of 
White professionals in investing increases by 
25 percentage points. White men are the most 
represented group in investing roles, particularly 
at more senior levels, with White men being more 
than eight times as prevalent as White women at 
the MD level (L2) today.

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Asian professionals in PE

Asian professionals are the largest racial minority 
in PE investing roles. They hold 28 percent of all 
associate-level investing roles in PE offices in 
Canada and the United States. However, the share 
of Asian investing professionals declines to 
12 percent by the MD level (Exhibit 18).4 

Asian professionals’ share of investing roles 
remains around or above 22 percent until it 

drops seven percentage points from the VP (L4) 
into the principal level (L3)—and even further 
thereafter to 12 percent of MDs and 5 percent 
at the C-suite level. It also should be noted that 
Asian professionals are the only ethnic or racial 
minority group whose percent composition 
declines substantially from L2 to L15: White, Black, 
and Hispanic, Latino, and mestizo representation 
increases or remains relatively constant from MD 
to C-suite levels.

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Black and Hispanic, Latino, and 
mestizo professionals in PE

of leaders, respectively, in MD and C-suite roles 
(Exhibit 19).

On the surface, Black and Hispanic, Latino, and 
mestizo (hereafter “Hispanic”) professionals 
have similarly low representation across PE 
investing. Professionals from both groups have 
low representation in all levels of PE Investing, 
starting with 4 to 7 percent of entry-level and 
post-MBA associate cohorts. Both groups also 
lose roughly three to four percentage points 
between the post-MBA and MD levels (L5 to L2). 
With 3 percent Hispanic and 1 percent Black 
principals (L3), PE lacks Hispanic or Black role 
models in the leadership ranks for more junior 
professionals. One PE CHRO commented, “If I 
were a Black person looking at PE, I don’t think I 
would see a lot of people who look like me, and I 
don’t know if I would want to work there.” Despite 
the low numbers of Hispanic and Black principals, 
each group retains the low share through the top 
leadership ranks, with 3 percent and 1 percent 

Looking more closely at the trends reveals some 
differences in the Black and Hispanic experience 
in PE.

Black professionals make up 7 percent of entry-
level investing roles—close to double the share 
of Hispanic professionals. This number drops 
sharply, to 4 percent, for the associate (L5) class 
in offices in Canada and the United States. Black 
gender composition seems to mimic the overall 
PE investing gender story only at the post-MBA 
and VP levels, where Black women are just under 
a third of all Black investing professionals. As of 
year-end 2021, only 1 percent of all PE MDs (L2) in 
these offices were Black, with representation from 
Black women significantly lacking. The share of 
Black women does increase slightly in the C-suite, 
but there, Black representation (for both men 
and women) is still only a little over 1 percent of all 
reporting firms in Canada and the United States.

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022The Hispanic experience in PE investing also 
begins with low representation (4 percent) in 
entry-level investing roles. However, unlike Black 
investing professionals, this number grows to 
7 percent at the post-MBA associate (L5) rank. 
Thereafter, there is a higher Hispanic presence 
compared to Black presence at senior levels of 
PE firms, with 2.5 times and 3.9 times as many 
Hispanic principals and MDs, respectively. And 
yet, despite holding 3 percent of MD and C-suite 
roles, Hispanic representation on ICs was less 
than 1 percent. The gender imbalance for Hispanic 
professionals in PE investing is larger than it is for 
Black professionals: Hispanic women only account 
for about 16 percent of Hispanic professionals 
from post-MBA to principal (L5 to L3), dropping 
by nine percentage points to 7 percent of all 
Hispanic MDs. While it is clear that PE firms can 
improve talent attraction of Hispanic and Black 
professionals, the data show there is the most 
room to improve in attracting post-MBA Hispanic 
women, in particular; firms are also falling short 

in retention, and promotion of Black and Hispanic 
women at the principal and MD levels. 

However, this analysis speaks to the industry 
averages on ethnicity and race in Canada and 
the United States. Of course, there is a spectrum 
of PE firms: the top firms are close to doubling 
the industry average share for ethnic and racial 
minorities at the MD level, with 32 percent, while 
98 percent of MDs at the least diverse firms are 
White and Caucasian (Exhibit 20). 

As we saw with gender, diversity at the top 
does have an impact on the ability to retain 
diverse talent throughout the deal team. While 
the industry average for ethnic and racial 
minorities was 30 percent, industry laggards 
on MD-level ethnic and racial diversity were 
around eight percentage points below that 
industry average, with ethnic and racial minorities 
holding 22 percent of positions across the entire 
investing team.

Charting a path 
to a more diverse, 
equitable, and 
inclusive future

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022“What we need are consistent metrics and 
industry benchmarks so that firms can 
track representation and progress. Without 
these tools, we all operate in a vacuum.”

Jerilyn Castillo McAniff, Head of D&I at Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.

Our findings suggest a few critical areas for leaders 
who want to improve the diversity of talent in 
the industry:

Evaluate IC diversity. PE firms should take 
a critical lens to the diversity of their investment 
committees to understand if and why they are 
not more reflective of the makeup of their C-Suite 
and MDs. 

Consider region-specific obstacles to diversity. 
Offices in the Americas could strive for gender 
parity in hiring and attract more Black and Hispanic 
talent for post-MBA investing positions. PE firms 
may need to take a critical look at possible causes, 
such as barriers to entry or an unattractive culture, 
that results in low levels of representation of Black 
and Hispanic professionals even at entry levels 
of firms’ deal teams. For the current talent pool, 
firms could continue to improve promotion parity 
of women, Asian professionals, and Hispanics 
professionals into VP, principal, and MD roles. 

APAC offices can mend the broken rung from VP to 
principal by evaluating barriers to apprenticeship, 
sponsorship, and promotion of women, as well as 
by working to reduce MD and principal attrition.

European offices may reduce the loss of women 
from L5 to L2 and leverage the breadth of their 
women colleagues at L6, by striving for promotion 
parity for that first step up from entry level to 
Associate level, as well as in external hiring for mid-
tenure levels (L5 to L3). Examine the office culture 
with an eye towards potentially improving retention 
of investing employees.

Gather more intersectional diversity data. 
PE firms’ CHROs and Heads of DEI should push 
to improve the granularity of the data collected 
around the world, where possible, and devise 
solutions with these intersectional groups in mind.

IIs can use standardized—and simplified—
diversity metrics to evaluate PE funds. This will 
likely require collaboration among IIs. Furthermore, 
if not already asking, IIs should consistently require 
diversity metrics from all PE firms that approach 
them during fundraising.

Jerilyn Castillo McAniff, Head of D&I at Oaktree 
Capital Management, L.P., a global investment 
manager specializing in alternative investments, 
said, “What we need are consistent metrics and 
industry benchmarks so that firms can track 
representation and progress. Without these tools, 
we all operate in a vacuum. We can all do our part 
by participating in relevant industry studies and 
benchmarks, which gather data, track trends, and 
highlight key themes. Making progress will be 
a collective effort.”

Increasing the diversity of PE Investing teams takes 
time. While there are no quick fixes, the value to be 
gained by taking effective action could motivate 
sustained focus on the goal. Creating an equitable 
and inclusive culture will be the key to retaining 
a diverse workforce over time. Maria Pejter, 
head of HR for A.P. Moller Holdings, a privately 
held European investing company, shared, “By 
humanizing the culture a bit more, we will be able 
to make private equity firms a place to spend 
a career for reasons beyond just money. By doing 
that, you may automatically get more diverse talent, 
including at the most senior levels.”

Building a more diverse set of leaders at the helm 
of the private markets industry requires sustained, 
nuanced, long-term effort. However, this research 
shows that progress is being intentionally made 
across several PE firms, and rewards come with 
that diversity, with IIs continuing to prioritize and 
seek diverse talent for further allocation of funds.

Methodology

Survey participants
This report draws on data gathered from 42 
companies—31 private equity firms and 11 
institutional investors in the Americas, APAC, and 
Europe. In addition, more than 300 private equity 
employees also responded to a survey about their 
workplace experiences.

Participating companies have shared data for 
their offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greater China, India, 
Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, 
Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, 
South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States. 

We divided those offices into three regions:

1.  The Americas: Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and 

the United States.

2.  APAC: Australia, Greater China, India, 

Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.

3.  Europe: Belgium, Finland, France, 
Germany, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and 
the United Kingdom.

The data used for the analysis on ethnicity and 
race came from 24 firms operating in Canada 
and the United States, representing about 7,500 
employees in the regions. These firms collectively 
operate in 17 countries. However, firms’ regional 
HR policies and the number of employees 
represented outside of Canada and the United 
States limited our ability to access data outside of 
Canada and the United States.

Survey process
Respondents were sourced to represent a global 
set of firms of diverse sizes (as measured by assets 
under management and location). They opted into 
McKinsey’s survey by responding to invitations 

from McKinsey & Company or by indicating their 
interest through a public sign-up form. 

Respondents submitted data about their firms’ 
talent pipelines. Institutional investors also 
provided data on how they make allocation 
decisions. While all participants were required to 
complete either the talent pipeline or decision-
making survey for their responses to be counted, 
the separate employee experience survey (EES) 
was optional. 

These data sets represent point-in-time 
snapshots and reflect companies’ responses and 
employees’ experiences at the time that the survey 
was taken. Talent pipeline and institutional 
investor decision-making data were collected 
between June and August 2022 and reflected 
firms’ talent pipeline data, as well as personnel 
changes across levels and in and out of the firms 
(that is, due to promotion, external hiring, and 
attrition) from January 1, 2021 through December 
31, 2021. While we worked with each company 
to ensure that submissions were complete 
and accurately reflected the stated figures, 
McKinsey did not independently validate the data 
submissions but instead worked with each firm’s 
executive sponsor and day-to-day contact. 
After the surveys were completed, we grouped 
companies by type to create peer groups with 
which to develop benchmarks. 

Additionally, employees were surveyed in the EES 
between July and September 2022 on their 
workplace experiences.

Interviews with leaders at institutional investing 
and PE firms occurred between September 
and October 2022 and provided supplemental 
commentary on the experience of investing and 
non-investing employees at their firms, as well 
as shared industry trends and key initiatives and 
challenges faced by the industry when pursuing 
DEI efforts. 

39

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022Talent pipelines
Overall metrics
We collected data from 127 talent pipelines 
from our respondents. The number of talent 
pipelines exceed the number of respondents 
because many respondents shared multiple 
talent pipelines within their firms to reflect their 
multiple geographies. We gathered talent pipeline 
data by country for each firm so that multiple 
offices in one country would be aggregated into 
one talent pipeline for that country. We ensured 
that the sample size was large enough to allow 
us to report metrics on workforce composition 
and mobility.

All pipeline metrics such as representation, rates, 
shares, and indices were initially calculated 
for each participating company. We then used 
aggregate data to create regional industry 
benchmarks. The global benchmark is a weighted 
average of the regional benchmarks, based 
on headcount.

Definition of job levels
Companies categorized their employees into six 
levels based on the following standard definitions, 
taking into account reporting structure and 
salaries for both investing roles and non-investing 
roles. The levels and definitions provided for both 
investing and non-investing roles were as follows:

 — L1—C-level executives or fund heads. These 
employees are responsible for the direction 
and focus of the organization and oversee 
management and coordination across multiple 
corporate functions. Board members are not 
included unless they are also employees.

 — L2—Managing directors or partners. These are 
direct reports to the C-suite and fund heads. 

 — L3—Principals, directors, or senior vice 
presidents. These employees oversee 
activities for subunits of their organizations 
(often functions or business units) and act on 
directions from top leaders. 

 — L4—Vice presidents or senior managers. 
Investing VPs or non-investing senior 
managers oversee activities for subunits 
of an organization, generally reporting to 
L3 leaders.

 — L5—Associates or managers. These 

employees oversee day-to-day activities 
for smaller teams or initiatives. These are 

generally post-MBA investing roles and non-
investing manager roles.

 — L6—Entry level roles. These employees 

support day-to-day corporate activities. At this 
level, these roles are for pre-MBA investing 
analysts and non-investing junior staff.

Somewhat apart from this structure is the IC, 
the subgroup of investing leaders that makes 
firm-wide strategic decisions for PE funds. This 
group is made up of people drawn from the L1 and 
L2 ranks.

Metrics and analytics
The talent pipeline data we gathered covered 
representation for men and women in aggregate 
and in investing and non-investing roles. 
Respondents also reported on the number of 
men and women who were hired, who were 
promoted, and who left the company voluntarily 
and involuntarily during 2021. Respondents had 
the option of providing ethnicity and race data 
on staff in investing and non-investing roles. 
Responses provided as “other/not reported/
prefer not to answer” have been excluded from all 
analyses on gender and ethnicity and race. 

Promotion rates and attrition rates were calculated 
for women and men (as well as for ethnicity and 
race, where applicable) at each level. 

 — Promotion rates were reported as the percent 
of a subgroup promoted into that level. They 
were calculated by dividing the number of 
promotions of that gender or ethnicity and 
race into the level over the course of the year 
by the number of employees of that gender or 
ethnicity or race in the available pool (that is, 
the level below) at the start of the year. 

 — Attrition rates were reported as the percent 

of a subgroup to leave that level. They 
were calculated by dividing the number of 
individuals of each gender or ethnicity and 
race who leave the company at a given level 
over the course of the year by the number of 
employees of that gender or ethnicity or race in 
that level at the start of the year. 

The share of external hires at each level was 
calculated as the percent of external hires brought 
into a level from a given gender or ethnicity or race.

Institutional investors’ decision-making survey
We surveyed CIOs and their equivalents at ten 
institutional investors around the world about 

40

The state of diversity in global private markets: 2022their perceptions on the state of diversity in 
the private markets and the extent to which they, 
as institutional investors, request diversity data 
from PE firms that are conducting fundraising. 

Respondents were asked to allocate $100 million 
between two funds based on diversity profile, 
historic fund performance, and whether they had 
allocated to each private equity firm in the past. 
Responses were aggregated as an unweighted 
pooled average across companies for each of 
the six scenarios. 

One firm in each scenario was a diversity 
leader. The other was a diversity laggard. 
The scenarios were:

1.  The institutional investor has allocated to 

both firms before, and the firms had the same 
historic returns. The firms differed on 
gender diversity.

2.  The institutional investor has allocated to 

both firms before, and the firms had the same 
historic returns. The firms differed on ethnic 
and racial diversity.

3.  The institutional investor has not allocated to 
the diversity leader before, and the funds had 
the same historic returns. The firms differed on 
gender diversity.

4.  The institutional investor has not allocated to 
the diversity leader before, and the funds had 
the same historic returns. The firms differed on 
ethnic and racial diversity.

5.  The institutional investor has allocated to 

both firms before, and the diversity leader had 
lower historic returns. The firms differed on 
gender diversity.

6.  The institutional investor has allocated to both 
firms before, and the diversity leader had lower 
historic returns. The firms differed on ethnic 
and racial diversity.

On gender diversity, industry laggards reported 
that 10 percent of their investment professionals 
were women. Industry leaders reported 
50 percent.

On ethnic and racial diversity, laggards reported 
that 5 percent of investment professionals were 
ethnic and racial minorities. Industry leaders 
reported 30 percent.

PE firms with higher fund performance had 
firm-wide average historic returns of 14 percent 
for most recent similar funds. Firms with lower 
fund performance had firm-wide average 
historic returns of 12.8 percent for most recent 
similar funds.

The employee experience survey
More than 300 employees of private equity firms 
chose to participate in the optional employee 
experience survey. The survey was fielded 
July through September of 2022. Other than 
demographic questions such as role, age, and 
family status, the survey questions asked about 
job satisfaction, perceptions of diversity, and 
other workplace experiences. Where practical, 
the survey offered respondents a ten-point 
response scale. The survey results were 
reported as an unweighted pooled average of 
responses for respective sub-groups across 
the participating companies.

Diversity metric reporting
Twenty-three participating PE firms shared 
the vintage year for their top three funds and 
indicated if they provided diversity data during 
the fundraising for that fund. The share of PE 
firms providing diversity metrics was calculated 
by dividing the count of PE firms that indicated 
that they have—during that year or previously—
provided diversity data during fundraising by 
the total count of PE firms.

Interview process
We supplemented the survey data with qualitative 
data drawn from interviews with 15 executives at 
participating PE firms and institutional investors, 
conducted in September and October 2022. We 
selected interview subjects to gather responses 
from firms of different sizes (as measured by AUM) 
and geographies. 

In the interviews, we asked leaders about their 
observations about the experiences of gender 
and ethnic and racial minority employees at their 
firms, industry trends around DEI, and important 
initiatives and challenges facing DEI efforts in 
the industry. 

All interviews were confidential unless subjects 
explicitly consented to revealing identifying 
information. For this reason, some quotes we use 
are anonymized. Further, some quotes have also 
been edited for clarity.
