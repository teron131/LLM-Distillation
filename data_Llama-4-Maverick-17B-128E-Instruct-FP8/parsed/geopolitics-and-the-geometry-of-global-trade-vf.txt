McKinsey Global Institute

The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact base to 
aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s companies 
and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, and functional 
knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are solely the responsibility 
of MGI directors and partners.

Our research is currently grouped into five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity: Creating and harnessing the world’s assets most productively

 — Resources of the world: Building, powering, and feeding the world sustainably

 — Human potential: Maximizing and achieving the potential of human talent

 — Global connections: Exploring how flows of goods, services, people, capital, and ideas   

shape economies

 — Technologies and markets of the future: Discussing the next big arenas of value   

and competition

We aim for independent and fact-based research. None of our work is commissioned or funded 
by any business, government, or other institution; we share our results publicly free of charge; 
and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While we engage multiple distinguished 
external advisers to contribute to our work, the analyses presented in our publications are MGI’s 
alone, and any errors are our own.

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade At a 
glance

 — Trade in concentrated products binds geopolitically distant economies. Trade between 
geopolitically distant economies accounts for nearly 20 percent of global goods trade but 
close to 40 percent of trade in globally concentrated products—products such as laptops 
and iron ore for which three or fewer economies provide at least 90 percent of global exports.

 — Trade reconfiguration is under way. Since 2017, China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and 
the United States have reduced the geopolitical distance of their trade by 4 to 10 percent 
each. The United States has also reduced the geographic distance and diversified the origins 
of its trade. Meanwhile, economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Brazil, and 
India are trading more both across the geopolitical spectrum and over longer distances.

 — Increased investment into a range of developing economies suggests further trade 

reconfiguration in coming years. While roughly 60 percent of greenfield investment has 
flowed to developing economies since 2010, its destination is shifting. The largest leaps 
in the past two years were in Africa and India, while announced investment into China and 
Russia fell by about 70 and 98 percent, respectively, compared with prepandemic averages.

 — The future of global trade will involve trade-offs—reducing geopolitical distance 

comes with increasing trade concentration, and vice versa. We explore two types of 
reconfiguration. In one, economies shift their trade to more geopolitically aligned partners. 
As a byproduct, average trade concentration increases by 13 percent and economic growth 
suffers. In the other, trade relationships diversify so that no economy is highly dependent on 
another, but as a consequence, the geopolitical distance of trade increases by 3 percent.  
The degree of trade-off varies significantly across individual economies. 

 — Business leaders need to position their organizations for uncertainty. This positioning 
can involve cultivating an insights edge, anticipating and adapting with scenario planning, 
developing a portfolio of strategic actions, and building geopolitical muscle. Businesses can 
also embrace cooperation to contribute to, and help shape, the discourse on the evolution of 
global connections.

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade Introduction

Trade reconfiguration has been making headlines. In 2023, Mexico became the United States’ 
largest goods trade partner.1 Vietnam’s trade with China and the United States has been surging.2 
European economies’ energy imports shifted dramatically away from Russia, while imports of 
some products from China, such as electric vehicles, boomed.3  

Along with such headlines, a new lexicon has emerged among policy makers and business 
leaders. Use of terms such as “decoupling,” “derisking,” “reshoring,” “nearshoring,” and 
“friendshoring” in corporate presentations increased more than 20-fold between 2018 and 
2022.4 The subtext of these terms is often geopolitical, which is increasingly a feature of 
talk about trade. Average tariffs on goods trade between China and the United States have 
increased between three- and sixfold since 2017.5 Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 
the European Union (EU), the United States, and many other players imposed sanctions. A 
large majority of companies from Europe, Japan, and the United States withdrew or curtailed 
operations in Russia. The rerouting of shipping lanes due to the Red Sea crisis that started in 
December 2023 not only incurs additional costs, delays, and security complexities but also 
has the potential to create far-reaching shock waves beyond the immediate locations affected. 
More broadly, the number of new global trade restrictions each year has been steadily 
increasing, from about 650 new restrictions in 2017 to more than 3,000 in 2023.6  

How can we understand and calibrate these recent changes? Historically, value chains have 
shifted gradually, and recent years are no exception. No economy has gained or lost more than 
an annualized two-percentage-point share of global exports in any value chain since 1995. 
Despite increasing tariffs and restrictions in recent years, that has not changed. But, since 2017, 
the geometry of economies’ connections has been shifting.7 We analyze the changing geometry 
of global goods trade using four measures, each of which has its own limitations: trade intensity, 
geographic distance, import concentration, and a new measure of “geopolitical distance.” This 
new measure is the geopolitical analog of geographic distance. It is an imperfect approximation 

Introduction

of how geopolitical alignment relates to trade, constructed by looking at UN General Assembly 
voting records. 

These measures in combination help us to calibrate the speed and direction of recent shifts. For 
example, between 2017 and 2023, US imports became 18 percent less concentrated in their 
origins.8 This is a rapid reversal of the trend prior to 2017 of gradually increasing concentration 
of US imports. China has been increasing its share of trade with developing economies around 
the world.9 This has driven a 7 percent increase in the average geographic distance of its trade 
since 2017, a slight acceleration of the preexisting trend. Germany experienced a 6 percent drop 
in the average geopolitical distance of its trade between 2017 and 2023, driven by a decline in 
trade with Russia. However, Germany’s trade with China increased. Meanwhile, the economies 
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Brazil, and India are engaging in more 
extensive trade over longer distances and across the geopolitical spectrum.

How this geometry will develop is uncertain. Take Vietnam, which has increased its exports 
to the United States while deepening its upstream trade and investment links with China. For 
some observers, the US shift toward imports from Vietnam represents a rerouting of trade from 
China, with limited value added in Vietnam. In this telling, China and the United States remain 
interconnected, but supply chains have become longer and more opaque.10 Seen another way, 
this shift could be the first step in a journey toward Vietnam emerging as a major global supplier 
for some goods, adding substantial value across a value chain well beyond final assembly. 

The future is not set. But what could further reconfiguration entail? Hoping to bracket a range 
of futures, we consider two illustrative trade reconfigurations and their potential implications. In 
one, global trade fragments and “deglobalizes” by shifting to being between more geopolitically 
aligned partners. In the second, trade becomes more diversified, without a geopolitical lens. 
Both illustrative types of reconfiguration may involve trade-offs. Trade fragmentation may lower 
geopolitical risks, but it raises trade concentration and comes at significant macroeconomic 
cost. Diversification may improve resilience to some shocks and offer opportunity for a range of 
partners, but it retains ties among geopolitically diverse trading partners.

This paper concludes by exploring how business leaders might consider positioning their 
organizations for shifts in the geometry of global trade.

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade

1. Trade connects 
the world across 
geopolitical 
differences

The world is deeply interconnected. Recent McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) research found that 
every major region relies on imports for more than 25 percent of its consumption of at least one 
type of critical resource, manufactured good, or service.11 MGI has also found that 10 percent 
of the value of today’s global goods trade is globally concentrated: three or fewer economies 
provide at least 90 percent of global exports.12  

Goods trade profiles vary substantially among economies

Not all economies’ goods trade is alike, and the geometry of their connections matters (Exhibit 1). 
We have looked at the three largest trading economies in the world, China, the United States, and 
Germany, as well as the combined membership of ASEAN, which represents the fourth. We have 
also considered the United Kingdom, as the second-largest economy in Europe after Germany; 
India, the world’s second-largest developing economy (after China); and Brazil, the largest 
developing economy outside Asia. 

Four indicators capture some of the contours of that geometry. Economies vary in how much they 
trade in comparison to their size; this is their trade intensity. Economies also vary in their patterns 
of trade partners, in both where they are, or geographic distance, and how aligned they are on 
global issues, or geopolitical distance. For geopolitical distance, we introduce an imperfect but 
quantitative measure based on UN General Assembly voting records between 2005 and 2022 
(see Sidebar 1, “Measuring geopolitical distance and its limitations”). Finally, economies differ in 
how broad or narrow their network of supply relationships is, or their import concentration. 

ASEAN economies and Germany are highly integrated regional manufacturing hubs 
The economies of ASEAN and Germany trade more in goods than many other large economies, 
measuring trade relative to their GDP. This is partly driven by their integration into regional 
manufacturing value chains that crisscross national borders. Correspondingly, Germany tends to 
trade over shorter geographic and geopolitical distances than do other major trading economies, 
because Europe is relatively compact and politically aligned. This integration between European 
economies also drives lower levels of import concentration due to extensive intra-EU trade. The 
United Kingdom is also integrated into regional trade networks, but its economy skews toward 
services, and it has lower goods trade intensity than Germany, for example. ASEAN economies,

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade Sidebar 1. Measuring geopolitical distance and its limitations

We used votes in the UN General Assembly 
between 2005 and 2022 as a proxy 
for alignment on global issues. Since 
many votes are procedural or repeated, 
we included only votes designated as 
“important” by the US Department of State. 
No Department of State data were available 
for 2022, and therefore we included the 
six votes relating to Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine. Overall, the analysis includes 201 
votes, or about 15 percent of all UN General 
Assembly votes in the period.

We defined a one-dimensional spectrum 
of geopolitical position based on votes. We 
used principal component analysis to map 
each voting country on a one-dimensional 
voting spectrum ranging from zero to ten.1 
Explicitly, we did not define this spectrum 
based on any specific country or pair of 
countries. Most advanced economies, 
including Germany, Japan, South Korea, 
and the United States, fell between zero 
and two. China and Russia were positioned 
between nine and ten.

We then took geopolitical distance 
between any two economies to be their 
difference on this scale. In all calculations 
in this paper, the position of each country 
is assumed to be fixed on the voting 
spectrum over time.

Limitations
This approach has several limitations. 
Most fundamentally, voting practices at 
the UN are only one marker of geopolitical 
alignment. Other important factors, such 
as security ties, economic ties, and 
other bilateral agreements, may not be 
correlated with UN General Assembly 
voting. Conversely, UN General Assembly 
votes, even those deemed “important” 
by the US Department of State, may 
not represent countries’ positions on 
global issues. Voting practices may be 
influenced, for example, by strategic 
(or temporary) alliances or agreements, 
domestic political considerations, or 
simply the idiosyncrasies of a country’s 
view on a particular matter. In addition, 

countries’ positions relative to one another 
differ across global issues. Collapsing all 
votes into a one-dimensional scale loses 
this nuance. Despite these limitations, 
other researchers have found empirical 
trade-related analyses to be robust 
across a range of measures of geopolitical 
alignment, including UN General 
Assembly votes.2 

Separately, we note that countries’ 
positions on global issues can change 
over time. We conducted robustness 
checks over different times between 2005 
and 2022, and we found that for many 
economies—including China, the European 
economies, Japan, South Korea, and the 
United States—their geopolitical position 
by our measure did not vary significantly. 
However, the position of some countries, 
such as Brazil and Mexico, was more 
variable, although always toward the center 
of the spectrum.

1  The approaches used to analyze UN General Assembly votes to identify countries’ positions on global issues differ. We used principal component analysis (PCA) for three 
reasons. First, PCA minimizes the information lost by reducing the voting data to a single dimension. Second, PCA can identify patterns and similarities in voting behavior 
that agreement scores can miss. Third, PCA can be used for clustering, as in the definition of economy groups in chapter 3.

2  See, for example, Benny Kleinman, Ernest Liu, and Stephen Redding, International friends and enemies, Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies working paper 
number 292, March 2022. This study considers UN General Assembly votes, bilateral strategic rivalries (based on policy maker assessments), and formal alliances. 

by contrast, trade intensively across Asia, which is farther flung geographically and includes 
countries that span a larger range on the geopolitical spectrum, from Australia to China.

The United States has more distant trade partners and lower trade intensity 
The trade intensity of the United States is lower than that of many other large economies for a 
range of reasons, including the size and endowments of its domestic economy, which enables 
it to source many products at home. The value of freight between US states was similar in 2022 
to the country’s international goods trade.13 Geography plays a role, too. Less than 5 percent 
of global GDP is generated by economies within 5,000 kilometers of the United States, 
mainly Canada and Mexico. By contrast, 26 percent of global GDP is generated by more than 
80 economies within this distance of Germany. Not having a dense network of neighboring large 
economies contributes to the relative concentration of US trade relations and its trade across 
longer distances than average.

China trades across the geopolitical spectrum
China, the largest trading economy in the world, stands out for trading more with geopolitically 
distant partners than any other economy. It trades extensively across the globe, including with 

9

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade the EU, Japan, South Korea, and the United States, which in combination account for 40 percent 
of its total goods trade. As China’s economy has developed, it has come to consume more of what 
it produces, lowering trade intensity. Its total goods trade in 2022 was equivalent to 35 percent 
of its GDP, down from the peak of 64 percent in 2006. 

Brazil’s trade travels farther than most, with significant volumes going to China 
Brazil’s trade travels farther geographically than that of many economies, reflecting intensive 
trade with faraway China. The strength of this connection also contributes to Brazil’s relatively 
higher import concentration.14 Moreover, its export mix skews toward commodities. Indeed, five 
commodities (from iron ore to coffee) represented half of its exports by value in 2022. Its largest 
export is soybeans, with a cultivated area the size of Bangladesh dedicated to meeting China’s 
demand. As a result, its trade intensity can swing in line with commodity cycles, with recent high 
prices driving an uptick. 

India is near the global average in its trade geometry 
India sits toward the global average across dimensions. This reflects its broad trade relationships 
with Asia, Europe, and the United States, which also support relatively diversified import 
relationships. Its own position toward the center of the geopolitical spectrum—and its trade 
relationships across this spectrum—results in its trade traveling geopolitical distances that are 
similar to the global average. 

Larger economies tend to trade over wider geopolitical distances

It is a notable feature of today’s trade geometry that some of the largest trading economies in 
the world, including China, Japan, and the United States, do significant business with economies 
at the opposite end of the geopolitical spectrum. In 2021, the average geopolitical distance 
that goods traveled was about the distance between Chile and the United States or China and 
Nigeria: 3.4 units apart on a geopolitical distance scale running from zero to ten. The trade of 
many large trading economies travels farther, sometimes substantially so, than this average 
geopolitical distance—for example, Germany and Russia are about eight units apart (Exhibit 2).

Countries toward the middle of the geopolitical range, such as Brazil, India, and Mexico, also 
trade over geopolitical distances similar to the global average. Why? Because their trade is 
mostly with economies at either pole of the spectrum. Overall, only 8 percent of global goods 
trade flows among economies that sit between two and eight on the zero-to-ten scale. Europe 
is different; its political alignment and economic integration of individual economies give rise to 
trade over shorter geopolitical distances. But even Europe has historically relied on geopolitically 
distant partners for certain critical products, such as Russia for energy resources prior to 2022.

Trade with geopolitically distant partners can be perceived as a source of economic vulnerability. 
Some economies may rely on geopolitically distant partners’ demand for their exports. If trade 
frictions arise—as they did in recent years for Australia’s exports of coal, wine, and barley to 
China, for example—the exporting economy may lose access to key markets. Other economies 
may rely on geopolitically distant partners for their imports of key products. For instance, 
although Germany’s average geopolitical distance of trade was lower in 2021 than that of many 
other large economies, its reliance on Russia’s exports of energy products led to a substantial, 
and difficult, trade reconfiguration following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Nearly 40 percent of trade in globally concentrated goods is between  
more geopolitically distant partners 

Concentrated trade between geopolitically distant partners may be a candidate for 
reconfiguration. Today, nearly 20 percent of global goods trade is between more geopolitically 
distant economies, defined here as more than eight units apart on the geopolitical distance 
scale (Exhibit 3). And that trade is skewed toward products that are highly concentrated in their

sourcing—almost 40 percent of trade in globally concentrated products is between geopolitically 
distant economies. 

Important examples of globally concentrated products traveling above-average geopolitical 
distances from exporters that are more geopolitically similar to the United States include iron 
ore, soybeans, and flat-panel-display manufacturing equipment. Iron ore is mainly exported by 
Australia, with more than 80 percent of its exports flowing to China. And China is the world’s largest 
soybean importer, with the majority of its imports sourced from the United States and Brazil.

Other products, such as laptops, cell phones, and computer monitors, travel above-average 
geopolitical distances, as they mainly flow from China to advanced economies such as Europe 
and the United States (Exhibits 4 and 5). This profile shows China’s role as a global processing 
hub—almost 20 percent of all flows of globally concentrated products go to China, often

as imports of resources or capital goods. And a further 40 percent of all flows of globally 
concentrated products come out of China, typically in the form of manufactured goods.

Trade in some globally concentrated products is being scrutinized amid perceptions that it may 
pose higher risk. For example, the United States is looking carefully at its supply security for a 
type of permanent magnet made with neodymium (a rare earth metal).15 Germany, South Korea, 
and the United States all import more than 85 percent of the neodymium magnets they need 
from China. The magnets are used in a range of applications, from electric vehicle (EV) motors to 
industrial robots (see Sidebar 2, “Neodymium magnets”). As another example, China is exploring 
new sources for high-purity quartz.16 The United States is home to the world’s highest-purity 
quartz, which is required for manufacturing semiconductors. 

Reconfiguring trade in globally concentrated products to avoid the risk of reliance on 
geopolitically distant partners would not be easy. Few alternative suppliers today are 
geopolitically closer for the importing economy. As such, globally concentrated products may 
represent a floor below which—at least in the near term—trade between geopolitically more 
distant partners cannot fall without leading to significant supply disruptions. They are both the 
ties that bind and arteries of vulnerability.

Sidebar 2. Neodymium magnets

Magnets made from neodymium, a 
rare earth metal, are vital to the energy 
transition, used increasingly in EV motors 
and offshore wind turbines. The magnets 
are also economic multipliers. On average, 
$1 of neodymium magnets enables $600 of 
economic output. A hard-disk drive, for 
example, requires about four grams of 
neodymium in its actuator arm, but those 
four grams are essential to the entire unit. 

Neodymium magnet supply is globally 

concentrated. China accounts for 
60 percent of global neodymium mining, 
about 90 percent of separation and 
refining, and 92 percent of neodymium 
magnet manufacturing. 

The high concentration of neodymium 
magnet supply is perceived to pose a risk.1 
Some EV manufacturers are moving to 
alternatives, such as electrically excited 
motors, to reduce their exposure, and 
governments have been initiating brown- 

and greenfield projects to diversify supply.2 
But in 2023, the share of neodymium 
magnets imported from China by 
economies such as the United States and 
South Korea remained stable, indicative of 
the fact that diversifying supply is neither 
rapid nor straightforward.

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade 2. Trade 
reconfiguration 
is under way 

Historical shifts in the trade landscape have tended to be gradual. Since 1995, individual 
countries have gained or lost no more than 2 percentage points of annualized global export share 
in any given value chain.17 At the global level, despite recent disruptions, shifts in global export 
share have not moved faster than this historical pace. Since 2017, no economy has gained or lost 
more than 1 percentage point of annualized global export share in any given value chain. 

But has the geometry of these connections been changing? In our four dimensions of trade—
trade intensity, geographic distance, geopolitical distance, and import concentration—several 
meaningful shifts have emerged recently (Exhibit 6). Since 2017, China, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States have reduced the geopolitical distance of their trade. The 
United States has also diversified trade and reduced its geographic distance. Meanwhile, trade 
intensity for these economies has remained relatively constant, suggesting that reshoring to 
reduce dependency on critical imports by increasing domestic production has not yet occurred 
at scale.18 These aggregate shifts are due to changing trade patterns across the four dimensions 
(Exhibit 7). ASEAN, Brazil, and India are trading more—across the geopolitical spectrum and 
over longer distances—growing their participation in global trade with a wide range of partners 
around the world. 

Although nearshoring has been a prominent feature of recent debate, the United States is a 
relative outlier in shifting some of its trade toward geographically closer partners. Moreover, 
the extent of this shift is less pronounced than the shift toward geopolitically closer partners. 
The other economies we analyze show no substantial evidence of nearshoring of trade 
relations; rather, their trade has often been traveling farther on average. It is a similar story for 
diversification: while the United States has materially shifted to a more diverse set of trade 
partners, others so far have not.

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade US trade is shifting away from China to a range of 
other countries, including Mexico and Vietnam 

The United States has substantially diversified its import share away from China across a range 
of manufacturing sectors. Vietnam, in particular, and other Asian economies gained share. At the 
same time, Mexico has also gained US import share, in large part from Japan in transportation 
equipment and ASEAN in agriculture, a trend indicative of nearshoring. The net effects on US 
goods trade have been a sharp decrease in concentration of US imports, a 10 percent shortening 
of geopolitical distance, and a 3 percent reduction in geographic distance.

China’s share of US manufactured goods imports fell from 24 percent to 15 percent between 
2017 and 2023. During this period, electronics was the sector with the largest drop in share, from 
almost 50 percent to about 30 percent. Vietnam experienced the most marked increase in share 
of US imports in this sector. These shifts have often reflected the impact of increased tariffs on 
imports from China, but this is not the entire story. For example, laptops and cell phones are not 
subject to trade dispute tariffs, but China’s share of US imports of these products still fell in 2022 
and 2023, with share accruing to Vietnam.19 

In value-added terms, what the United States imports from China may not be falling so 
dramatically. In other words, the United States may be importing more goods largely produced 
in China, which are then rerouted through third countries that contribute a small amount to the 
final value—for example, simple final assembly. As a result, supply chains may be longer and not 
necessarily less reliant on China.20 Between 2017 and 2020, the most recent year for which data 
are available, China’s share of foreign value added in US final consumption increased slightly, 
from 24 to 25 percent (Exhibit 8). Laptops are an example. Between 2017 and 2022, US imports 
of laptops from Vietnam more than doubled, rising by about $800 million. Upstream of this, in the 
same period, Vietnam’s imports from China of laptop parts, such as printed circuit boards and 
touch screens, also doubled—rising by about $800 million, too. 

Mexico became the United States’ largest import partner in 2023. Its largest share gains were in 
agriculture and transportation equipment, sectors where China is a less significant trade partner 
for the United States. Mexico’s share of US transportation equipment imports, for example, rose 
from 26 to 32 percent between 2017 and 2023. Most of this share came from Japan, which lost 
five percentage points of share of US transportation equipment imports in this period. However, 
China’s share in this sector remained stable at about 4 to 5 percent.

The United States has substantially 
diversified its import share 
away from China across a range 
of manufacturing sectors.

Europe’s trade with Russia has collapsed, but its trade with China  
has grown

Trade between the EU and Russia dropped around 80 percent between February 2022 and 
September 2023, reflecting the break in relations after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. UK trade 
with Russia fell by more than 95 percent. Finding alternative supplies of energy resources 
became an urgent imperative, and this happened very swiftly. For instance, Russia’s share of 
Germany’s natural gas imports fell from around 35 percent in January 2022 to less than 1 percent 
in 2023 (Exhibit 9). Germany’s imports in this sector shifted, notably to Norway, supplemented by 
liquefied natural gas from the United States. 

In manufacturing sectors, Germany’s exports have shifted away from Russia and, often, 
away from advanced economies in Europe, with increased share to the United States and 
developing European economies. Germany’s imports, too, have tended to shift away from large 
manufacturing economies in Europe toward smaller, often developing, economies in Europe—in 
particular Poland—as well as China. 

Indeed, Europe’s trade with China has remained robust. The EU share of imports from China 
increased slightly, from 19 to 21 percent, between 2017 and 2023.21 In some sectors, the increase 
was more substantial. For example, the share of Germany’s imports of electronics from China

grew from 24 to 30 percent between 2017 and 2023. This is the sector in which US imports 
from China declined the most. Similarly, China’s previously small contribution to Germany’s 
transportation equipment imports rose, driven by imports of EVs. In 2017, 1 percent of Germany’s 
EV imports came from China. In the first nine months of 2023, Germany’s EV imports totaled 
about $12 billion, with nearly a quarter coming from China.

As a result of these shifts, Germany’s trade distances increased between 2017 and 2023. 
Although there were some shifts indicative of nearshoring—for example, Poland gained share of 
Germany’s imports of electronics, machinery, and transportation equipment—often the import 
share gained by China in these sectors was even greater.

China’s trade has reoriented further toward developing economies

China has increased its share of trade with geopolitically closer partners, too. This has often 
been a result of forging stronger trade ties with developing economies and a relative reduction in 
trade with advanced economies such as Japan, South Korea, and the United States. 

Between 2017 and 2023, China witnessed a decline in its share of exports bound for the United 
States (partly due to trade tariffs), offset by a rise in export share to ASEAN economies (Exhibit 
10). China’s imports also shifted—away from Japan and South Korea, and toward ASEAN 
economies, Latin America, and the Middle East, along with Russia.

As a result, in 2023, developing economies tipped the balance to account for just over half 
of China’s goods trade, up from 42 percent in 2017.22 These shifts have tended to be toward 
geopolitically closer trade partners.

Nickel is an example of an import shifting toward a geopolitically closer partner and becoming 
more concentrated as a result. China’s imports of ferronickel, used to make stainless steel, from 
Indonesia have boomed, rising from under $2 billion in 2017 to more than $12 billion in the first 
10 months of 2023. Indonesia is geopolitically closer to China than some other economies from 
which it had historically sourced nickel products, such as Canada. Chinese companies have been 
active in the development of Indonesia’s nickel industry and in investing in facilities in Indonesia 
that can process lower-grade nickel into battery-grade products.23 

There are exceptions to China’s general trend of shifting trade toward developing economies. 
Australia is an example. Between 2017 and 2023, Australia gained share of China’s imports,

driven by iron ore and lithium. By 2023, Australia accounted for more than half of China’s 
lithium imports and 64 percent of its iron ore imports by value. The interdependence goes both 
ways. China is the destination for more than 80 percent of these exports for Australia. But this 
interdependence may become less pronounced in time. Between 2018 and 2021, China invested 
twice as much as Australia, Canada, and the United States combined to acquire lithium assets.24 
And a joint venture including a range of Chinese and global stakeholders has been developing an 
iron ore mine in Guinea, which may become the world’s third-largest iron ore exporter.25  

Recent investment announcements suggest further reconfiguration  
in the future

Greenfield cross-border investment can be a precursor to a shift in trade patterns.26 Investment 
by one economy into another can stimulate increased trade growth between the two.27 
For example, in the case of manufacturing, investment can be a precursor to new flows of 

31

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade intermediate and capital goods between the two economies.28 The shape of these investment 
flows today may be a leading indicator of how trade flows will shift in the future.

While roughly 60 percent of greenfield cross-border investment has flowed to developing 
economies each year since 2010, its destination is shifting. Announced investment into Africa, 
India, Central Asia and the Middle East, and developing economies in Europe has risen markedly 
relative to prepandemic averages (Exhibit 11).29 But announced investment into China and Russia 
has declined substantially—by 67 percent for Greater China (and 70 percent for Mainland China), 
and 98 percent for Russia.30 And advanced economies in Asia, Europe, and North America have 
experienced increases, too.

Developing economies that have experienced recent increases in investment announcements 
are often sourcing investment from economies across the geographic and geopolitical spectrum. 
For example, ASEAN economies have witnessed increases in investment announcements from 
China, Europe, and the United States. Both China and Europe have announced meaningfully 
increased investment into Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East, and developing economies 
in Europe. And while India has seen declining investment announcements from China, total 
investment announcements into India have surged, driven by economies spanning Asia, the 
United States, and Europe.31 

Investment announcements suggest that China’s trade reorientation toward developing 
economies may continue and that these economies may grow their global exports. On average, 
in each year between 2015 and 2019, about $50 billion (or 50 percent) of China’s announced 
outbound greenfield investment was destined for Africa, ASEAN, Central Asia and the Middle 
East, and developing economies in Europe. Between 2022 and 2023, this figure is on course to 
double to more than $100 billion, or more than 70 percent of total announcements annually. 

In Africa, the region with the largest percentage increase in investment relative to prepandemic 
averages, investment has generally been destined for a narrow set of economies, mainly in 
North Africa, rather than the continent more broadly. Morocco and Egypt have seen the largest 
gains in dollar terms. Morocco, for example, has experienced a surge in announcements from 
Chinese companies investing in the EV battery supply chain.32 Excluding North Africa and 
South Africa, recent announced investment into the continent has been relatively flat. However, 
conditions vary widely within sub-Saharan Africa. For example, announced annual investment 
into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Uganda collectively reached $15 billion 
on average in 2022–23, tripling relative to prepandemic averages. Over the same period, 
announced investment into Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria fell by more than 35 percent.

US investment patterns suggest potential further trade reorientation toward ASEAN economies. 
In 2022–23, announced US greenfield investment into China fell 70 percent from the 2015–19 
average, but announced US investment into ASEAN almost doubled. Recent US investment 
announcements do not yet indicate a sustained nearshoring boom to Canada, Mexico, or indeed 
Latin America. After a number of high-profile announcements of investment into Mexico in 2022, 
global announced investment into that economy in 2023 is on course to be about 30 percent 
lower than the 2022 figure, similar to the average between 2015 and 2019. And an increasing 
share of investment into Mexico is now coming from China; recent announced investment from 
China has more than doubled relative to prepandemic averages.

Although Europe’s trade with China has grown recently, investment patterns suggest the 
potential for a future shift toward economies in intra-European trade. Europe’s announced 
greenfield investment into China in 2022–23 was nearly 50 percent lower than prepandemic 

32

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade averages. Meanwhile, intra-European greenfield announcements surged, almost doubling 
relative to prepandemic averages. In 2022 and 2023, Germany’s greenfield investment 
announcements for economies such as Italy, Portugal, and Romania more than doubled relative 
to prepandemic averages.

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade 3. Different  
futures, different 
trade-offs 

While the geometry of global trade has been gradually reconfiguring, its future shape remains 
uncertain. One possibility is an increasingly fragmented “deglobalized” world in which trade 
reorients toward flowing between geopolitically aligned economies. This could be a continuation 
of the slight decrease in the geopolitical distance seen in global trade over recent years that 
has, for instance, been linked to the decreasing share of United States–China trade or the rapid 
reduction in EU–Russia trade. Another form of reconfiguration could involve diversifying trade 
relationships so that no economy is overly dependent on any other for the products it imports. 
This kind of trend could be consistent with increased greenfield investment in a diversity of 
developing economies.

To explore a range of potential economic and trade outcomes, we examined two types of 
reconfiguration. The first involves a trade fragmentation driven by heightened trade frictions 
between geopolitically distant economies. The other focuses instead on diversification—that is, 
reducing import concentration—without a geopolitical lens (see Sidebar 3, “Modeling approach 
and limitations”). Overall trade connections between countries would look very different in 
a fragmented world but would remain quite similar to today under diversification, with shifts 
occurring across specific value chains (Exhibit 12).

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade Sidebar 3. Modeling approach and limitations

We used the Global Trade Analysis Project 
(GTAP), a widely employed, computable 
general equilibrium model, to generate two 
illustrative trade reconfigurations to 2035.1 

Economy grouping. We undertook an 
algorithmic clustering of economies based 
on UN General Assembly voting records 
between 2005 and 2022, supplemented 
by a review of security ties. Three groups 
emerged: (1) a Western group anchored by 
advanced economies, including Australia, 
Canada, EU economies, Japan, South 
Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States; (2) an Eastern group, including 
China and Russia; and (3) a “mid-aligned” 
group, including economies in Africa, most 
ASEAN economies, India, Latin America, 
and the Middle East.2  

Fragmentation. In this pathway, we analyzed 
the result of significant trade frictions 
between Western group and Eastern 
group economies, together with some 
moderate friction between each group and 
mid-aligned economies, stemming from an 
attenuated spillover of trade frictions. This 
could arise, for example, through increasing 
controls on imports and exports between 
the two groups.

Specifically, we simulated an increase 
in tariffs between Western group and 
Eastern group economies to 60 percent 
for critical goods and services, and 
20 percent for less critical products. For 
mid-aligned economies, we used tariffs of 
10 percent that affect only critical goods 
and services trade with Western group 
and Eastern group economies. Modeled 
tariff levels were calibrated based on 
historical precedent, to be large enough 
to drive a substantial reconfiguration but 

not eliminate trade entirely. Sixty percent is 
the highest tariff rate applied by the United 
States in the past century, and 20 percent 
is the approximate average tariff level 
between the United States and China 
following their trade dispute.3 We note that 
tariffs are a mechanism to simulate trade 
tensions in the model, but in reality, a range 
of instruments and practices could lead to 
heightened trade frictions.

Critical products were hypothesized to 
experience increased trade frictions in order 
to reflect some countries’ moves in recent 
years—for example, controls related to 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
and materials or telecommunications 
infrastructure, and policies to encourage 
reshaping of EV manufacturing supply 
chains, all of which are critical sectors. 
Some of these moves have also generated 
frictions for mid-aligned economies. 
Product criticality was based on a bottom-
up assessment of about 5,500 products 
against large economies’ stated strategic 
objectives and expert interviews. 

Diversification. We used a real-world 
analysis of product-level goods flows to 
sketch out the level of reconfiguration 
required to diversify trade in goods—
specifically, shifts that would be consistent 
with no product having a geographic 
import concentration (measured using 
the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index) greater 
than 3,000.4 The driver of this type of 
reconfiguration could be a widespread 
shift by companies, across sectors, to 
increase resilience through diversification 
of their supply. Such a coordinated shift 
is entirely hypothetical but serves as a 
sensitivity to test how the global economy 

and trade relations may be affected by a 
different type of approach that focuses 
on reducing concentration rather than on 
reconfiguring geopolitical ties.5 In total, 
about $1.3 trillion, or about 5 percent of all 
global goods trade, was diversified.

Limitations
This analysis (and similar analyses using the 
GTAP model and other models in the same 
family) has some important limitations. 

First, because sectoral resolution is limited, 
the GTAP model cannot identify product-
level linkages between economies. Therefore, 
it may overestimate—perhaps substantially—
the extent to which output from different 
economies is substitutable. For instance, the 
model considers iron ore from Australia to be 
substitutable by copper from Peru because 
both are in the minerals sector.6  

Second, the model may not capture 
the potential real-world price impact of 
switching between producers. In the starting 
equilibrium, there is no price differentiation 
between supplying economies. That is, 
$100 of electronic equipment from Japan is 
assumed to be interchangeable with $100 of 
electronic equipment from Southeast Asia, 
when in reality the $100 purchase would buy 
different amounts and different quality. 

Third, the model bases shifts in response 
to policy shocks on existing trade partner 
shares. All else being equal, the model 
will replace reduced imports from one 
partner with imports from existing partners 
proportional to their pre-shock shares. 
This may unduly favor existing major 
suppliers and underestimate the potential 
upside for some developing economies.

1 The GTAP model is calibrated on real-world economic data, including multiregion input-output tables and price, income, and trade elasticities of demand. It computes the 

state of the global economy in response to a policy shock over the medium term once economies (including labor and capital) have adjusted to a shock.

2  These labels were based on prevailing geography. All global economies were allocated to one of these three groups; those listed represent economies and regions with 

more than 2 percent share of global exports in 2022.

3  Sixty percent was the tariff rate applied to dutiable imports in the US Tariff Act of 1930, known as the Smoot–Hawley Act. 
4  The 3,000 threshold is broadly consistent with recent definitions of geographic import concentration used by official sources. A Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) of 3,100 
was used to indicate concentration in a global market in Vulnerable value chains, Productivity Commission, Australian Government, 2021. An HHI of more than 2,500 was 
used by the US Geological Survey as part of its criticality assessment.

5  Due to the sectoral and geographic resolution of the model, we focused on the 300 or so flows containing the most concentrated products by value that represent around 

70 percent of the total global reconfiguration required to deconcentrate trade. 

6  The non-substitutability of these examples is handled in the model through trade elasticities. The value of these elasticities is based on academic research on historical 

trade patterns, which may not be representative in the illustrations considered here.

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade Fragmentation: Intra-Western trade increases while China 
strengthens ties with mid-aligned economies

This pattern of change entails radical deepening of geopolitical divides, reflected in significant 
trade frictions between Eastern group and Western group economies. Both groups conduct 
nearly friction-free trade with other mid-aligned economies (with some tariffs on critical goods, 
reflecting spillover of trade frictions). 

This leads to a significant drop in trade between the two groups and increased trade within 
economy groups. In the specific case we consider, the share of global trade that occurs 
between Eastern group and Western group economies falls by 70 percent to 2035. The value 
of trade within the Eastern group more than doubles, and within the Western group it increases 
40 percent, relative to today. 

The global economic impact could be profound, although we note that estimates are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. In our modeling, long-run global GDP is reduced by about 1.5 percent, 
with some economies’ GDP falling by 6 percent, without considering spillover effects.33 Other 
analyses have found a downside impact on global GDP running from close to zero to 7 percent, 
with some economies experiencing up to a 12 percent decline in GDP.34 To put this in context, the 
impact of the global pandemic on global GDP in 2020 was about 5 percent.35  

The wide range of estimates is driven by different assumptions and channels of impact 
considered. Across analyses, the assumed size and scope of trade frictions vary, as do the 
number and contours of economy groups. Some analyses also consider spillover effects such as 
reduced technological diffusion, investment, and competition as well as policy uncertainty. When 
considered, these effects amplify the downside.

Among the different groups, economies in the Western group tend to reorient their trade 
relations inward. Almost all of the share of trade lost with the Eastern group is picked up by 
other Western group economies. As a result, the share of Western group trade that is with mid-
aligned economies remains similar to today, at about 20 percent. However, the shape of this 
reconfiguration varies by economy and value chain. For example, in the case we consider, the 
share of US electronics imports of each of Japan and South Korea doubles relative to today. 

Among the different groups, economies 
in the Western group tend to reorient 
their trade relations inward. Almost 
all of the share of trade lost with 
the Eastern group is picked up by

40

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade These economies have comparative advantage in supplying products that China currently 
exports to the United States. For Europe, by contrast, most of the trade reduction with Eastern 
group economies is substituted by more intra-European trade. 

The picture for the Eastern group is different. Today, almost half of Eastern group trade is with 
Western group economies. In the fragmentation case we consider, this share falls to about 
15 percent. Although there is some trade diversion to within-group partners, the most notable 
shift is toward mid-aligned economies. These economies come to represent almost half of 
Eastern group trade, up from just over 30 percent today. 

Mid-aligned economies reorient their trade toward the Eastern group.36 This reorientation 
is particularly marked in some sectors where Western group economies had been a major 
destination for Eastern group exports. For example, mid-aligned economies’ share of electrical 
equipment imports from the Eastern group rises from 34 percent today to nearly 50 percent. As 
a result, China remains a major global exporter across sectors and the largest trade partner for 
economies representing one-third of the world by value of trade in both Eastern and mid-aligned 
groups. Indeed, it remains the world’s largest exporter in 16 out of 43 sectors, as it is today. 

Diversification: China loses share in concentrated 
products but gains in others

This second type of reconfiguration could occur through a widespread shift by companies, 
across sectors, to diversify their supply. The overall geometry of global trade might be broadly 
unchanged, but substantial shifts would occur within and among sectors. 

The most material shifts occur in relation to China. China loses share of its trade partners’ 
imports in sectors where it is currently a concentrated supplier, particularly in electronics and 
textiles, but gains share with other partners and in other sectors. To give an example of the 
reorientation, the value of US imports of electronics from China (which are concentrated) does 
not increase in real terms relative to today’s levels, but China gains share in sectors including 
chemicals and services, leaving the overall US share of imports from China stable to 2035. A 
similar pattern plays out for other economies, which diversify away from China in some sectors 
and see increased trade with China in others. Overall, in the case that we consider, the value of 
flows from China that are diversified to new partners totals about $700 billion, or 12 percent of 
China’s total exports. This is more than half the value of all global trade that is diversified. 

Our modeling suggests that the economic impact of this type of reconfiguration on China may 
be substantially lower than in fragmentation, with GDP falling by about 1 percent, compared 
with 6 percent. Global average GDP impact is closer to 0.5 percent, compared with 1.5 percent 
in fragmentation. While diversification reconfigurations have not been as extensively modeled 
as fragmentation, analyses by others suggest that derisking selected sectors has a significantly 
more muted economic impact than fragmentation.37 

In general, diversified sectors tend to shift to next-best suppliers, with patterns differing 
by geography. For example, in the transportation equipment sector, Japan diversifies its 
concentrated imports from the United States, shifting to imports from China and Southeast Asia. 
Germany diversifies in this sector, too, increasing its share of imports from a range of partners in 
Europe. In electronics, Southeast Asia gains global share.

In the reconfiguration illustration we consider, mid-aligned economies gain share when they 
have substantial existing supply relationships, offering an opportunity to scale in diversification. 
However, mid-aligned economies with less established global supply relationships, such as 
those in Africa or Latin America, do not experience substantial trade increases. To shift this 
calculus, which is grounded in existing production capabilities, more mid-aligned economies 
would need continued differential investment of the sort that our analysis of recent investment 
announcements suggests may have started.

41

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade Both reconfigurations involve trade-offs

Either type of reconfiguration entails trade-offs. Broadly, fragmentation may reduce 
interdependence between geopolitically distant partners but increase supply concentration 
and therefore potentially lower resilience to other types of risk, such as natural disasters. It also 
risks materially lower growth. Diversification may reduce acute points of interdependence for 
specific goods but will require continued linkages and cooperation among geopolitically distant 
economies. These broad findings vary substantially by economy groups and within economies. 
However, the fact of trade-offs holds generally (Exhibit 13). 

China: Fragmentation lowers geopolitical distance of trade but also 
GDP growth; diversification substantially shifts the export mix 
In reconfigurations toward either fragmentation or diversification, China remains a globally 
significant trading economy, but one with meaningfully different trade complexions.

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade In the fragmentation geometry, in which China reorients from the Western group toward 
developing economies, it could be less exposed to geopolitical shocks but more exposed to 
other supply shocks and economic downside. In the illustration we consider, the geopolitical 
distance of China’s trade falls by 40 percent relative to today. Trade ties with Russia, for example, 
strengthen—trade between the two economies more than doubles by 2035 relative to today. 
Ties with mid-aligned economies in Central Asia and the Middle East are strengthened, too, with 
trade increasing more than 50 percent relative to today. Of course, this assumes that geopolitical 
distances remain constant, which might not be the case.

As China shifts away from Western group imports, it comes to depend on a smaller set of 
import partners, significantly increasing import concentration. In this illustration, China’s 
import concentration would rise by 42 percent relative to today, and for other economies in the 
Eastern group, the increase would be even greater. At the same time, loss of access to Western 
group markets would drive substantial economic downside for China under fragmentation. The 
drop in its trade with Western group economies is not entirely compensated for by expansion 
into alternative markets, leading to oversupply and deflation. Its trade share of GDP falls 
11 percentage points, from 39 percent today to 28 percent. Effects within the economy amplify 
economic downside in sectors like construction that are not widely traded but contribute 
materially to domestic economic activity. Indeed, in our modeling, China’s economy is more 
affected than other large economies in fragmentation, with GDP falling by about 6 percent.

In the diversification geometry, China can divert exports to other partners and gain export share 
in sectors where it was previously a less significant supplier. This shift often occurs toward 
mid-aligned economies, contributing to a 7 percent reduction in its geopolitical distance of 
trade relative to today. China’s import concentration falls by 6 percent. While these aggregated 
metrics do not change substantially, China’s large industrial capacity shifts from being a source 
of concentration to being a source of diversification. For example, while China loses global share 
in textiles exports, it gains in transportation equipment and automotive—sectors for which it was 
a less significant supplier. This sort of economic reconfiguration may not be straightforward, and 
there may be more significant short-term economic consequences as China adjusts.

Western group: Fragmentation reduces geopolitical distance of trade, but concentration  
remains; diversification broadly retains today’s geopolitical distances
In the fragmentation geometry, the average geopolitical distance of Western group trade 
falls 30 percent. However, import patterns tend to reconfigure rather than diversify. Germany 
provides an example. Its import concentration increases 6 percent overall as imports shift into 
an existing network of mainly European partners. While China’s share of Germany’s computer 
sector imports falls from 18 percent to less than 1 percent, the share of imports from a narrow set 
of Western group economies increases to about 90 percent. Here a trade-off appears between 
potentially reduced geopolitical trade exposure and higher supply chain concentration. But this 
trade-off varies across economies. For example, the United States develops more diversified 
trading relationships, with import concentration falling 7 percent, suggesting that its resulting 
network may be more resilient. 

Moreover, fragmentation may act as a drag on growth. Reconfiguration leads to not only a loss 
of export markets but also higher import costs as a result of switching away from Eastern group 
economies to next-best suppliers. Indeed, recent work suggests that US prices have increased 
up to 9 percent in those sectors where it has moved away from China to alternative suppliers.38 
However, the Western group has economic mass, representing about 60 percent of global GDP, 
which enables these economies to develop new suppliers and markets with Western group 
partners. The overall economic downside in our modeling is smaller for the Western group than 
the Eastern group. However, lack of exposure to the faster-growing developing economies in 
the mid-aligned and Eastern groups may narrow this gap over time. Moreover, Western group 
economies with large shares of trade with the Eastern group today, such as Australia, Japan, and 
South Korea, experience greater downside. 

43

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade In the diversification geometry, imports diversify for most Western group economies while 
aggregate interdependence with China is preserved. However, specifics differ among Western 
group economies. For instance, concentration of US imports falls by 5 percent and geopolitical 
distance increases by 6 percent, driven by increased overall trade with China. For electrical 
equipment, concentration of US imports falls by more than 20 percent. In Germany, by contrast, 
import concentration changes little, because its trade relations are already relatively diversified. 
In sectors where it does diversify, trade tends to reorient to a narrower set of intraregional 
partners plus China. Hints of this can be seen already—between 2017 and 2023, China gained 
share in Germany’s electronics imports —the same sector where the United States diversified 
away from China the most. In this illustration, the geopolitical distance of Germany’s trade 
increases, without being associated with the potential benefits of lower concentration.

Most mid-aligned economies do not experience increased trade participation or  
accelerated growth in either case—without continued investment
In both illustrations, the average trade intensity of mid-aligned economies falls by four 
percentage points relative to today. While it is conceivable that mid-aligned economies may gain 
from their position as alternative trade partners, representing a new source of supply in both 
fragmentation and diversification, this outcome does not appear in our illustrations.

In the fragmentation geometry, mid-aligned economies reorient to source imports from low-
cost Eastern group supplier economies. This drives an increase in import concentration, 
which rises 13 percent. This increase is particularly marked in sectors for which the Western 
group had previously been a destination for Eastern group exports, such as machinery and 
electrical equipment. For economies such as Brazil and India, the share of electrical equipment 
imports from China rises by 14 percentage points, driving an increase in import concentration 
of almost 30 percent. However, consumers and businesses in mid-aligned economies may 
benefit from lower import prices. As a result, the economic impact of fragmentation on mid-
aligned economies in our modeling is lower than for the Eastern group and Western group—but 
fragmentation is not a driver of growth.

In the diversification geometry, mid-aligned economies reduce their import concentration by 
18 percent, with potential benefits for resilience. However, the share of global exports from mid-
aligned economies does not rise substantially; it remains stable at less than 30 percent. In other 
words, economies do not diversify toward mid-aligned economies. There are two main drivers of 
this. First, trade relations tend to be diversified to a range of existing major supplier economies, 

In both illustrations, the average 
trade intensity of mid-aligned 
economies falls by four percentage 
points relative to today. 

44

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade including Western group economies. Relatively smaller mid-aligned suppliers generally do not 
gain share. Second, China may be able to gain more export share than mid-aligned economies. 
As a result, the largely developing economies in the mid-aligned group do not on average see 
material uplift in trade participation. 

A different future that delivers meaningful benefits to mid-aligned economies is surely 
possible. For example, our analysis of recent investment announcements suggests that India 
and economies in Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East may increasingly participate in 
global production networks. Indeed, the diversification illustration suggests bright spots for 
mid-aligned economies gaining share in some sectors. However, our illustrative paths suggest 
that increased trade participation and economic upside are not guaranteed for mid-aligned 
developing economies in either a fragmented world or the type of diversification we have 
considered. Additional measures may be needed to achieve improved outcomes for these 
economies. The measures could include sustained foreign and domestic investment into 
productive industries, supportive trade policies, infrastructure development, and upskilling of 
human capital and capabilities as well as institutional enablers.

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade 4. Implications 
for business 
leaders

Given the findings in this paper, how should trade and its potential futures concern business 
decision makers, especially the leaders of multinational companies (MNCs) that are responsible 
for about two-thirds of global exports?39  

The collective decisions of MNCs have already played a significant part in the shifts in the 
geometry of global trade observed thus far, and they will influence the path ahead through the 
choices they make on supply chains, production, and markets. In a more fragmented world, 
companies may operate in, and source from, a narrower range of countries or organize their 
business in more modular ways, aligning both sourcing and production with end markets. A more 
diversified trading system is equally likely to reflect the heightened diversification observed in 
the supply chains of individual MNCs. These are just two of many ways that global trade may 
change. Business leaders need to prepare for an uncertain world, but they can also contribute to 
shaping the future geometry of global trade. We suggest five actions to consider.

Establish an insights edge 

In the ever-evolving landscape of trade, business leaders need to elevate their baseline insight to 
gain a competitive edge, developing a granular view of their own company, of other companies, 
and of the global context in which they are doing business. 

For insight into their supply chains, they need to understand connections in detail. Where is 
their company forging ties with new economies or tapping into previously overlooked sources? 
They may need to develop deeper insight into the lower tiers of the supply chain, where 
both geopolitical exposures and globally concentrated products can lurk. Only 2 percent of 
companies have visibility into their supply base beyond the second tier.40 Simultaneously, a global 
perspective on value chains and relevant products is paramount. How do global trade’s shifting 
dynamics compare with movements in their company’s changing footprint? For instance, some 
companies shift manufacturing to India and ASEAN, while others intensify operations in China.41  

Finally, leaders need to monitor the world for tremors that may signal shifts. What changes in key 
indicators are relevant? It seems clear that geopolitical tensions, trade controls, and regulatory 
shifts should be tracked, but so, too, should tightness in the labor market for specific skills, 
for instance, or changing macroeconomic conditions that could affect the attractiveness of 
production locations and their funding.

47

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade Anticipate and adapt with scenario planning

Moving beyond insight to establish a fact-based view, detailed scenarios unveil potential 
trade shifts and disruptions, emphasizing considerations crucial to the geometry of trade. Key 
questions arise. Does the scenario affect all or selected trade ties around a group of countries (as 
is the case in the fragmentation reconfiguration we have considered) or specific ties from a single 
country (as seen in shifts with Russia)? Is the disruption sudden (as in COVID-19) or gradual (for 
instance, tariff level increases)? Is it temporary (like the Suez Canal blockage) or indefinitely long? 
Does it completely halt trade or make it costlier, as import tariffs or rerouted shipping lanes do 
(like the Red Sea disruption in late 2023)? 

Robust scenario planning considers competitors and the broader ecosystem. Should a 
company expand investments beyond final assembly in anticipation of growth of manufacturing 
capabilities as more upstream and downstream businesses relocate to a new area? Or should 
it curtail new capital investments in anticipation of increased export controls from a specific 
location and the departure of other companies? Leaders need to proactively assess how these 
shifts will influence competitive opportunities.

Develop a portfolio of strategic actions

A clear information baseline and a suite of scenarios provide the groundwork for action. A 
proactive set of actions can be pursued in anticipation of shifts, while others can be planned and 
set in motion by specific trigger points.

Many actions will be specific to a particular company, but some types are broadly applicable. 

 — Shift supply chains, production locations, or end markets. Such moves require 

commitment. Businesses can contemplate whether to stay in or exit existing markets 
to reduce exposure or expand opportunity. They can weigh whether and where to build 
additional capacity, in established markets or new, smaller ones. For example, a company 
might consider locating manufacturing or research facilities in a developing market that may 
become more strategic under some reconfiguration pathways, or it might pursue acquisitions 
to reshape its global footprint.

A clear information baseline and a suite of  
scenarios provide the groundwork for 
action. A proactive set of actions can be  
pursued in anticipation of shifts, while 
others can be planned and set in motion  
by specific trigger points.

48

Geopolitics and the geometry of global trade  — Establish real options. Some actions require initial commitment but offer the opportunity to 
double down boldly if circumstances merit. They could include investing in new technologies 
or products that offer an alternative to concentrated, riskier inputs; exploring partnerships or 
joint ventures to localize in key markets; and developing alternative supply networks.

 — Take “insurance” actions. Such actions require limited commitment and may prove to be 

unnecessary, but they might make a big difference in unlikely but profound scenarios. They 
could entail holding strategic inventories or executing contracts for backup supply.

Build muscle and bone for navigating geopolitics

Understanding of geopolitical realities is becoming a core capability for the MNC leaders and 
their teams whose firms face uncertainty in global trade. Executives should develop a grasp 
of context, nuance, and business implications well beyond what they can learn from news 
headlines. Approaches include direct recruiting of talent, investing in skills, and continuous 
engagement on related topics. Boards will want to draw on the latest research and frameworks 
as well as regular sessions with global experts. And they can learn from other MNCs that are 
wrestling with similar challenges.

All of this might be described as the “muscle” of executive and board capabilities. Companies 
also need the “bone” of processes and systems that support geopolitically informed decision 
making. For example, enhanced instrumentation such as digital early-warning systems and risk 
dashboards can support timely insights relevant to global trade. Strategic planning processes 
can formally incorporate geopolitical considerations into strategy and capital allocation. 

Embrace cooperation

Even while acting within their own organizations, business leaders can actively seek to shape 
the future path of trade, identifying how best to navigate some of the potential trade-offs across 
different regions and sectors, potentially in concert with other stakeholders. They can shape the 
discourse on shifting trade geometry. A future with more diversified trade holds many potential 
benefits, not only in the form of resilience to certain forms of supply disruption but also as a way 
to promote a more inclusive trading system and economy. A broad and diversified web of trade 
connections will not be achievable without cooperation.42  

Perceptions of geopolitical and strategic risk and a reconfigured global trade system are clearly 
much on the minds of business leaders as well as policy makers. Any such reconfiguration takes 
time in a deeply interconnected world, but even now there is early evidence of change. More may 
well come. The mid-20th-century American baseball star Yogi Berra has been quoted as saying, 
“You’ve got to be very careful if you don’t know where you are going, because you might not get 
there.” In the current state of uncertainty, the imperative for business leaders is to be prepared 
for a range of potential shifts in the geometry of trade and to have a strategy in place to help 
shape a new architecture to match an evolving world.

imports in 2023, up from 7 percent in 2017.

22  These figures consider Mainland China’s 

imports and exports, but exclude trade within 
Greater China.

economic activity and trade, but we note that 
these data may differ materially from other 
sources’ foreign investment statistics.

30  Analysis of recorded investment into China, 

as opposed to greenfield investment 
announcements, also shows a recent 
decline. See Nicholas Lardy, Foreign direct 
investment is exiting China, new data 
show, Peterson Institute for International 
Economics, November 2023. Greater  
China includes Mainland China; Hong  
Kong SAR; Macao SAR; and Taiwan, China. 

31  For China’s declining investment into India, 

see, for example, Harsh V. Pant, “India cracks 
down on Chinese investment as mood turns 
against Beijing,” Foreign Policy, April 2020.

32  Harry Dempsey, “Chinese battery  
groups invest in Morocco to serve  
Western markets,” Financial Times, 
September 27, 2023.

33  GDP reductions reported in this chapter  
are relative to a baseline continuation of 
global growth to 2035. All other reported 
figures compare shifts relative to 2022.

34  For an overview of some recent work, 

see Shekhar Aiyar et al., Geoeconomic 

fragmentation and the future of 
multilateralism, International Monetary 
Fund, January 2023. See also Gabriel 
Felbermayr, Hendrik Mahlkow, and 
Alexander Sandkamp, “Cutting through 
the value chain: The long-run effects 
of decoupling the East from the West,” 
Empirica, volume 50, January 2023.

35  For comparison, this figure is the difference 
between the estimated global GDP for  
2020 and actual global GDP. See Global 
economic prospects, World Bank, January 
2020; and World development indicators, 
World Bank, 2023.

36  A hint of this can be seen from recent  

events. For instance, India substantially 
increased imports of energy resources  
from Russia as a result of reduced demand 
for Russia’s exports from many Western 
group economies.

37  In addition to the summary by Aiyar et al. 

(2023), see, for example, David Baqaee et 
al., What if? The effects of a hard decoupling 
from China on the German economy, Kiel 
Institute for the World Economy,  
December 2023.

Barometer. Trade and capital is the first of 
five pillars of global cooperation, the other 
four being innovation and technology; 
climate and natural capital; health and 
wellness; and peace and security.
