summary

London has been the global epicenter of innovation 
in the insurance industry since the 1600s, when 
Lloyd’s of London was established. Today, the 
United Kingdom is positioned as a global leader in 
the field of insurtech. A flourishing ecosystem of 
start-ups, investors, and incumbents is working 
together to drive innovation and growth in the 
industry, from AI and machine learning to the 
Internet of Things.

London has the same number of insurtech unicorns 
as the rest of Europe combined and globally is sec-
ond only to Silicon Valley. Indeed, of the estimated 
3,000 insurtech firms in the world, approx imately 
280 are located in the United Kingdom—the 
highest number of insurtechs per capita among  
all major world economies.

However, the United Kingdom’s insurtechs have 
not been immune to the recent global tightening 
on valuations. The multiples of some of the most 
successful publicly listed insurtechs fell from  
15 times those of traditional peers to below the 
level of incumbent insurers, according to McKinsey 
analysis, and private capital funding decreased 
32 percent compared with the peak in 2021. Com-  
petition from Big Tech and other non-insurance 
companies has also accelerated. Amazon launched 
the Amazon Home Insurance comparison site in 
the United Kingdom, and Tesla Insurance reached 

$300 million in premiums by the end of 2022,1 
leveraging Tesla’s data availability and large 
customer base for better underwriting 
and distribution.

Despite these global challenges, the UK insurtech 
sector has remained resilient, employing around 
14,000 full-time-equivalent workers—almost 
4 percent of the total UK insurance workforce, 
according to our estimates. We estimate the 
sector brings in £2 billion to £3 billion in revenue 
per year—though we calculate its full (direct and 
indirect) impact on UK GDP to be closer to 
£5 billion and 60,000 jobs. Not all of these jobs 
are in London: we found that 31 percent of the 
country’s insurtechs are outside the capital.

Insurtechs also help increase diversity and inclu-
sion in insurance through their young, diverse, 
and well-educated employee base. Approxi-
mately 39 percent of staff are non-British, and 
about two-thirds are younger than 40, according 
to our research. 

The industry still faces key challenges that need 
to be addressed to ensure continued success, 
including protecting and enhancing the United 
Kingdom’s innovation ecosystem, especially 
access to talent and capital. Through a thorough 
review of the UK insurtech landscape, this report

findings, and practical, actionable insights for all 
stakeholders. These recommendations can serve 
as a road map to drive success for insurtech firms, 
insurance industry incumbents, and investors, with 
a particular focus on addressing the industry’s 
biggest challenges: access to capital and talent, 
scaling, and the current macroeconomic climate.

Undoubtedly, insurtechs have the potential to 
ignite transformative change within the insurance 
industry. One CEO we surveyed described the 

insurtech sector as the “grit in the oyster”: just as 
irritants provoke oysters to produce pearls, insur-
tech firms have the power to disrupt the status 
quo, stimulating traditional insurers to embrace 
innovation, foster product development, and 
extend coverage to previously underserved 
population segments. This dynamic interplay 
encourages healthy competition and pushes the 
industry toward a more inclusive and customer-
centric landscape.

The United Kingdom: The Nexus of InsurtechIntroduction

This report seeks to provide a comprehensive 
overview of the current insurtech landscape in 
the United Kingdom and the lessons that can be 
learned. Our research details the major segments 
of the industry, emerging trends, opportunities, 
and challenges, drawing on insights from 
approximately 50 UK insurtech firms and 
interviews with more than 20 CEOs, founders, 
investors, and other thought leaders across the 
industry (see sidebar “About the research”).

The report is intended to provide value for a variety 
of audiences:

transformation across the industry. By learning 
about technological and pioneering proposi-
tions across products, services, and other 
benefits, incumbents can benefit from a 
greater awareness of the opportunities for 
deeper collaboration and partnership.

 — Investors can gain a deeper understanding of 
the scale, diversity, and potential of the insur-
tech sector. We highlight emerging oppor-
tunities and areas in which value and activity 
are concentrated to help investors make 
informed decisions.

 — Insurtech firms and entrepreneurs can 
benefit from increased awareness of the 
opportunities and challenges unique to the 
UK ecosystem. They can also learn from the 
experiences of leading insurtechs.

By understanding the challenges and opportunities 
in the industry, stakeholders can work together to 
drive innovation and growth, leading to a stronger 
and more vibrant insurtech ecosystem in the United 
Kingdom and around the world.

tial for insurtech to unlock the next wave of  

About the research

The research was carried out by 
McKinsey in the first half of 2023 with 
support from Insurtech UK. It focused on 
three primary sources of information: a 
survey of British insurtech firms,1 a 
series of more than 20 interviews with 
industry leaders, and the construction of 
a detailed database of UK insurtechs 
based on data from several sources.

With the help of Insurtech UK, we 
dis tri buted the survey to all of the 

organization’s members. We received 
responses from 49 member firms, rep- 
re senting nearly half of the membership. 
The sample provided a representative set 
of responses from insurtechs across the 
industry, including insurance carriers, 
managing general agents, other distribu-
tors, and technology and service providers. 

Our database of UK insurtechs represents 
a consolidated single view of all key firms 
in the industry based on a range of 

sources, including major industry data - 
bases, the membership bases of major 
industry bodies (including Insurtech UK 
and national and regional fintech associa-
tions across the United Kingdom), and 
proprietary research by McKinsey.

Insurtech UK is the trade association for 
the community of insurtech firms in the 
United Kingdom, with a membership base 
of more than 100 insurtechs.

The United Kingdom: The Nexus of InsurtechThe UK 
insurtech sector: 
An emerging 
world leader

The United Kingdom could arguably be seen as 
the birthplace of insurtechs, with the first major 
website for comparing insurance prices launched 
in the early 2000s, even before the term “insurtech” 
began to have meaning. Today the United King-
dom’s insurtech sector has ample access to talent, 
sophisticated customers, financing, underwriting 
capacity, and a supportive regulatory environment.

Our research identified about 280 UK insurtech 
firms in current operation, which gives the United 
Kingdom about a 10 percent market share of the 
estimated 3,000 insurtech firms globally. The UK 
cluster is the world’s second largest, exceeded 
only by the United States with about 1,300 firms.

Though many UK insurtech firms are still in their 
infancy, we estimate the total revenue of all UK 
insurtech firms reached £2 billion to £3 billion in 
2022. This represents a sixfold increase over 
2015 estimates,2 which placed the sector at a 
total esti mated market size of about £400 million. 
UK insurtech firms now employ an estimated 

14,000 employees across the United Kingdom, 
around 4 percent of total employment in the 
country’s insurance industry. In addition, we 
estimate that a further 23,000 UK jobs are 
supported indirectly through either the supply 
chain of insurtech firms or the consumer 
spending of the sector’s employees. 

In this section, we highlight the key findings of 
our research.

The value of UK insurtechs

Overall, we estimate that UK-based insurtechs have 
a total enterprise value of about $21 billion, which 
puts the country third behind only the United States 
(approximately $100 billion in global value) and 
China (about $28 billion). However, adjusting for the 
size of the population, the United Kingdom has the 
top concentration of insurtechs among all major 
world economies (Exhibit 1).

The United Kingdom: The Nexus of InsurtechExhibit 1

At the time of writing this report, London was 
home to five insurtech unicorns3—the same 
number as in the rest of Europe combined. 
Across the pond in New York, another global 
center of finance and insurance, just three 
insurtech unicorns are in operation. 

clusters in both the northwest and the south of 
England are of particular note, as is the Welsh 
industry, which has a particular focus on price-
comparison websites, such as Confused.com, or 
insurer Admiral Group, the only FTSE 100 
company based in Wales.

But insurtech progress isn’t limited to the nation’s 
capital (Exhibit 2). Indeed, insurtechs are based in 
every one of the United Kingdom’s regions and 
nations—and we estimate that two-thirds of the 
insurtech workforce is located outside London, 
thanks to hybrid work. Three UK insurtech unicorns 
are headquartered outside London. Emerging 

Value by sector

In general, insurtechs can be organized into four 
categories: life and health (such as DeadHappy and 
YuLife), property and casualty (P&C) personal (such 
as ManyPets and Marshmallow), P&C commercial 
(such as CFC), and value chain enablers (such as 

We estimate that two-thirds of 
the insurtech workforce is 
located outside London, thanks

Tractable). In the United Kingdom, approximately 
60 percent of firms are focused on value chain 
enablement, and these firms account for about 
40 percent of the insurtech sector’s total value 
(Exhibit 3). These firms service a specific point in 
the value chain, such as distribution (for instance, 
price-comparison websites), pricing and under-
writing, claims services, or data and risk modeling. 
Behind the unicorns and a small number of highly 
valued firms, the segment contains a long tail of 
smaller firms. 

P&C commercial lines account for only about 
13 percent of identified firms, but they hold a 
significant portion (approximately 25 percent) of 
the sector’s total value. This category is particu-
larly relevant for the United Kingdom because of 
its connections with the Lloyd’s market. CFC 
Underwriting, for instance, started with an early 

focus on emerging risks associated with the 
internet and technology sectors and small and 
medium-size enterprises. It eventually expanded 
to cater to various industries and risk types across 
90 countries, thanks to Lloyd’s reach with licensed 
rated insurance capacity.

Increasing diversity 

Ample research has shown that a diverse work-
force has enormous benefits for businesses,4 and 
insurtechs are no exception. Our survey of UK 
insurtechs found that the industry is more gender-
diverse, more international, and younger than the 
London labor market overall (Exhibit 4). 

About 47 percent of the insurtech workforce is 
either female or nonbinary, a more even split than 
the approximately 40 percent estimated by Statista

are also younger: approximately two-thirds are 
under 40 years old. This is not unexpected given 
the youth of the industry itself and the propensity 
of start-ups to attract young talent. By compar-
ison, in the London market, less than 50 percent of 
the workforce is under 40.6

In addition, just 7 percent of UK insurance industry 
employees are from outside Europe, compared with 
20 percent of insurtech employees, demonstrating 

a much more international workforce. This diversity 
gives the industry access to a wider pool of the best 
global talent available. Reflecting this, about one-
quarter of the founders of the United Kingdom’s 
most valuable 25 insurtechs are not from the 
United Kingdom.

5  Statista numbers for full-time employees in the UK finance and insurance sector as of May 2023 show that women represent about 40 
percent of the workforce; see “Number of full and part-time employees in the financial and insurance sector in the United Kingdom (UK) as 
of 2022, by gender,” Statista, October 2022.

Reaching the 
industry’s full 
potential

As part of our research, we surveyed approximately 
50 members of Insurtech UK’s network about the 
opportunities and challenges facing the industry 
(Exhibit 5). When it comes to opportu nities, global 
expansion and financial health were the clear 
priorities. Indeed, many companies find fertile 
ground in the United Kingdom thanks to the 
factors described above—but ultimately, the desire 
to scale larger than the UK market pushes firms to 
expand into new geographies. 

And of course, insurtechs are focused on profit 
optimization and cost reduction to build a clearer 
path to profitability—as well as to give burgeoning 
firms a longer runway to sustain operations and 
fund their own growth. Respondents also high-
lighted the role of insurtechs in developing propri-
etary technology tools for players across the 
insurance value chain, as well as the importance  
of partnerships for distribution.

On the challenges side, leaders broadly agreed 
that accessing funding and acquiring customers 
are the two biggest challenges their firms face. 
While insur techs have comparable access to 
earlier-stage funding in the United Kingdom and in 
other countries, UK founders have typically faced 
challenges accessing later-stage funding to 
support the scale-up and growth of their firms. 
These challenges could be caused by UK-based 
venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) 
investors having less capital than US investors or 
expecting profitability earlier in the growth pro-
cess, as well as by the current economic cycle 
potentially limiting VC money available to 
invest globally. 

Meanwhile, acquiring new customers is another 
priority challenge—particularly in a constrained 
funding environment, when the focus needs to be 
on profitability, unit economics, and maintaining 

9

The United Kingdom: The Nexus of InsurtechExhibit 5

that runway. In response to changing market con-
ditions, particularly the tightening funding land-
scape, insurtech players are starting to evolve their 
KPIs. Forty-five percent of firms have changed their 
top three metrics since 2020. While growth remains 
the main mantra, about one-third of insurtechs also 
have metrics focused on margins or profitability 
(Exhibit 6). 

What can insurtechs do to reach their full potential? 
In this section, we offer examples of insurtechs that 
are finding inroads into new markets, successfully 
launching new products, and gaining a competitive 
edge in a rapidly evolving market. 

Reevaluate investment strategies, 
business models, and technologies

As both insurtech leaders and incumbents navigate 
this dynamic ecosystem, it becomes increasingly 
vital to reevaluate investment strategies, business 
models, and technologies. 

Investment strategies
The past decade has seen smooth and steady 
growth in investor interest in disruptive technology 
companies, including insurtechs—until recently. In 
2021, investor interest peaked across all tech verti-
cals. Total funds invested in insurtechs reached 
$16 billion globally,7 an increase of approximately 
120 percent over 2020. At their peak, publicly listed 
insurtechs saw gross written premium (GWP) 
multiples in excess of ten times.

Toward the end of 2021, however, the cycle started 
to turn. Total insurtech funding dropped an esti-
mated 40 to 50 percent in 2022, with continued 
quarter-over-quarter decreases. The “Tech Winter” 
had set in, with fewer company launches, less 
growth, more layoffs, and an increasingly difficult 
funding environment. Today, investors are investing 
at lower valuations and placing increased expec-
tations on their investments to generate cash and 
shift faster toward attractive unit economics.

Publicly listed insurtechs suffered particularly 
from the change in investor sentiment. According 
to McKinsey analysis, at their peak, publicly listed 
insurtechs were valued at significantly higher 
multiples (ten times their annual premiums) com-
pared with traditional insurance companies, which 
are typically valued at around one time their 
premiums. Some insurtechs achieved valuations 
as high as 25 times their annual premiums. Between 
their all-time high and March 2023, most publicly 
traded insurtechs saw valuations decline, on 
average, by approximately 89 percent. Indeed, 
some are now trading at a discount to the multiples 
enjoyed by traditional insurers. 

These dramatic shifts in valuation should not be 
interpreted as a total cooling of investor interest in 
the sector—in the United Kingdom or around the 
world. (For more on why, see sidebar “Insurtech as 
the ‘grit in the oyster.’”) Rather, investors’ expecta-
tions are shifting to include not just top-line growth 
potential but also profitability, unit economics, and 
predictability. Investors are increasingly expecting 
companies to demonstrate a longer, lower-risk 
runway and are undertaking more thoughtful due 
diligence. As a result, deals are taking longer.

The insurtech sector can act as a cat-  
alyst for wider change in the industry: 
“the grit in the oyster,” as one UK CEO we 
surveyed described it. Like the grit that 
irritates an oyster and causes it to create 
a pearl, insurtech firms can create dis-  
rup tion that spurs traditional insurers to 
innovate, develop new products, and 
expand cov er age to new segments of 
the population.

Beyond technological innovation, insur - 
techs can also help identify new risk 
areas and show how technology-based 
products can expand coverage. Whether 
these firms ultimately scale and become 
giants or are acquired by an incumbent, 
they can force the industry to evolve and 
close coverage gaps. 

A prime example is Zego, which provides 
insurance to delivery and gig-economy 
drivers. Recognizing an opportunity in 
Zego’s success, several major players 
have launched competing offerings. 
Other insurtechs are similarly expanding 
coverage for underserved areas, such as 
flood insurance, using Internet of Things 
tools unfamiliar to most incumbents.

In addition, insurtechs can disrupt entire 
marketplaces with radically new business 
models. Price comparison websites had 
this effect, helping to dramatically reshape 
the distribution of personal lines insurance 
over the past 20 years—increasing pene - 
tration, reducing prices, and driving 
efficiency in the market. 

And a larger, better-functioning insurance 
industry also directly benefits all con-
sumers. Access to affordable, quality 
insurance can help people achieve their 
life goals, whether that be homeowner-
ship or starting a family (for example, 
GAIA, a start-up focused on fertility care). 
Simi larly, insurance can help businesses 
grow, invest, and make decisions with 
more certainty. Finally, as the insurance 
industry grows, so does the amount that it 
invests in businesses across the country, 
helping raise the overall productivity of 
the global economy.

Business models
We are also seeing a shift of interest toward 
services-focused business models—for example, 
increased investor enthusiasm for B2B insurtechs 
with a recurring revenue model over B2C customer-
facing players with high customer acquisition and 
marketing costs, such as managing general agents. 
Investors also show continued interest in firms that 
identify and innovate in new risk classes or find new 
ways to address underserved segments. 

For instance, usage-based products that offer 
affordable premiums based on behavior and usage 
patterns are gaining traction, with companies such 
as Zego and Flock leading the way. Firms are also 
using gamification to encourage positive habits. 
For instance, YuLife is an employee benefits app 
that rewards users for healthier living, leading to 
improved risk profiles and premium discounts. 

Insurtechs such as Companjon and Qover are 
exploring embedded insurance propositions, which 

integrate insurance products into non-insurance 
services such as ride-sharing apps or e-commerce 
platforms. Insurtechs such as FloodFlash and Blink 
are offering parametric insurance, which bases 
payouts on pre-agreed parameters. This approach 
is also gaining popularity, as are AI tools for pricing, 
underwriting, claims processing, and 
fraud detection. 

The focus on profitability, unit economics, and 
cash generation over pure growth metrics has 
also provided an important impetus for the shift 
in business models.

Generative AI
As of mid-2023, the insurance industry in the 
United Kingdom and around the globe is actively 
exploring the emerging capabilities of generative 
AI and their potential impact. These capabilities 
include generating insights and informing decision 
making by synthesizing and summarizing unstruc-
tured data—a challenge the industry has long 

12

The United Kingdom: The Nexus of Insurtechstruggled to overcome.8 Generative AI can also 
help insurers interpret and generate code and 
documentation, create personalized marketing 
copy, and enhance clients’ interactions and 
customer journeys. 

The most innovative players in the industry are 
exploring solutions across the entire value chain. 
In claims management, for example, generative AI 
can extract key insights and make recommend-
ations from unstructured data to assist adjusters. 
It can also provide day-to-day support, training, 
and coaching for adjusters. Similarly, in under-
writing, generative AI can prepopulate relevant 
information, synthetize pertinent exposures and 
private or public data for risk assessment, 
generate draft communications for commercial 
quotes, and provide training to underwriters.

However, realizing the value of generative AI 
requires much more than the underlying 
foundational models. It requires leveraging pre- 
and post-model capabilities—such as query 
engin eering, data engineering, teaching, and 
change management—to drive significant impact. 
Further more, companies that adopt a comprehen-
sive business approach, foster an intentional 
culture of experimentation, and demonstrate 
openness to partnering with innovative players  
are likely to be better positioned to source the 
right capabilities and assets. 

Approach geographic 
expansion strategically

Despite the density of valuable firms in the 
United Kingdom, the country has yet to count a 
firm among the global top ten by valuation. Five of 
the global top ten are based in the United States, 
and three are Chinese. For UK firms to reach the 
valuation heights of these players, they will likely 
need to expand beyond their home market and 
seek larger customer bases globally.

Insurtech CEOs we surveyed expressed optimism 
about the future of the sector and identified geo-
graphic expansion as the most exciting opportu nity. 
Firms tend to consider a common set of factors 
when choosing where to expand, including market 
size, customer expectations, and regulatory 

landscape. These factors can help explain the 
prevalence of UK insurtechs launching into 
countries with close cultural and historical ties to 
the United Kingdom.

It’s crucial to tailor the market entry approach to 
the needs of the local market and find ways to use 
existing strengths. Today, the United Kingdom has 
one of the largest pet-insurance markets in the 
world, with penetration at around 23 percent.9 
When expanding to the United States, ManyPets 
knew that penetration there is much lower (less 
than 5 percent) and that the company needed to 
apply lessons learned in markets where new users 
are unaware of the product and can be educated 
on the benefits of pet insurance. 

For its part, YuLife has sought to increase its 
application of best practices from Big Tech such 
as event hosting, web scraping, and building out 
the sales development team. In addition to using 
brokers, the company is growing a large and 
mature sales team and marketing function, which 
has helped the company increase the number of 
corporate clients tenfold between 2021 and 2022 
to more than 500 businesses, with new customers 
accounting for close to 50 percent of the 2022 
customer base.

Tractable, a UK unicorn that uses artificial intelli-
gence to process insurance claims based on 
photos, positioned itself as an AI company first—
even before choosing insurance as its industry. As 
a result of its international expansion, 90 percent 
of the company’s revenues now come from abroad 
(with core markets in Japan, the United States, the 
United Kingdom, Southeast Asia, and Western 
Europe). To secure initial partners and customers, 
the company identified key stakeholders in target 
companies who would bet their career on using AI 
(for example, chief technology officers of insur-
ance companies). It was especially important to 
find such people when expanding to the United 
States, where many tech companies already exist, 
making it harder to import tech from the United 
Kingdom and Europe. Meanwhile, the company 
found that some other geographies, such as 
Germany, had a lower propensity to adopt AI 
technologies in insurance, making these countries 
more difficult to target.

The United Kingdom: The Nexus of InsurtechPartnerships can offer another good way of getting 
to market without spending too much on customer 
acquisition. US-based insurtech Lemonade has 
repeatedly leveraged partnerships to expand 
beyond its initial focus on the underserved renters 
insurance market in the United States, both inter-
nationally and into other lines of business. A 
partner ship with BNP Paribas Cardif expanded 
the company’s access to customers in France, and 
a partnership with Chewy helped to extend offer-
ings in the pet insurance market. Importantly, all 
partners must work to maintain the quality of 
customer experience to continue delighting users 
while growing the customer base.

Supplement organic growth with 
timely acquisitions

ManyPets developed many products and 
technologies in-house (for example, they built an 
automated claims system that they report pro-
cesses close to 50 percent of claims). However, 
acquisitions were sometimes a better investment 
than organic growth. These strategic M&A deals 
allowed the company to strengthen and differ-
entiate specific capabilities and accelerate 
international expansion plans faster than if it built 
everything in-house. In 2021, to extend the value 
proposition beyond insurance into preventative 
care, ManyPets acquired VetBox, which had 
already created bespoke pet care products. To 
gain independence in underwriting its own policies, 
ManyPets acquired the US-based insurance carrier 
Digital Edge Insurance Company in 2022. And 

Lemonade acquired Metromile to gain data and AI 
capabilities and access the motor line of business.

Attract the right talent

The United Kingdom has a deep well of talent, both 
from world-class universities and business schools 
and from the domestic insurance industry, including 
the world-leading Lloyd’s market. The UK has also 
long been an attractive place for international 
entrepreneurs to launch businesses. According to 
our research, 25 percent of the United Kingdom’s 
top insurtechs have non-British founders. One 
major investor described the United Kingdom as 
the best place in the world “to build, test, and 
validate” a proposition.

And yet in interviews with McKinsey, UK insurtech 
CEOs and founders said that it’s becoming more 
difficult for UK-based companies to attract Euro-
pean talent. It’s still possible, but insurance talent is 
often more expensive in London than in other UK 
cities, with firms struggling to match the packages 
of incumbents, especially in the tightening 
economic environment.

The right talent can make or break a start-up. 
Attracting high-quality people, especially when 
they already have an excellent corporate package, 
can be challenging. Employee-benefits provider 
YuLife focused on building a distinctive company 
culture that not only seeks to attract outstanding 
people but also aligns the organization’s values 
with its products.

range of tools to support their financial, emo tional, 
and physical well-being. Similarly, the working 
culture at YuLife aligns with the value of “well-
being.” For example, weekly all-company calls 
feature music, a brief introduction from a different 
member of the firm each week, and a shared cor-
po ate culture vocabulary. The com pany’s values 
are clear, and its success in the employee-benefits 
space (YuLife says its clients report 181 percent 
higher ROI compared with other employee-benefits 
providers) has opened up the opportunity to expand 
into other adjacencies, such as dental, health, and 
financial insurance.

Listen to the customer

UK insurance consumers are some of the most 
sophisticated in the world. One study found that 
British consumers have the fourth-highest insur-
ance literacy score among a survey of customers 
in 22 major economies,10 and they consume the 
fourth-highest amount of insurance globally.11

In the large and competitive UK insurance market, 
differentiation can be crucial—and customers can 
often be the best guides. ManyPets started as a 
digital broker aggregating demand for niche insur-
ance products and negotiating better terms for 
groups with similar needs. However, the company’s 
leaders realized that by focusing on pet insurance—
the one specific customer need that emerged again 
and again among the more than 320 groups of 
insurance—they could have an outsize impact in 
one segment and differentiate themselves better. 

The company used customer feedback to design 
features missing in competitor products (such as 
dental, preexisting conditions, and telemedicine) 
and to provide a great customer experience. 
After launching pet insurance in 2017, ManyPets 
launched two more supplementary products but 
eventually shut them down because they were a 
distraction keeping the company from becoming 
the best in its key core offering.

The United Kingdom: The Nexus of InsurtechConclusion

Five of the United Kingdom’s eight insurtech 
unicorns achieved unicorn status after the peak in 
the market in 2021. Furthermore, six of the ten most 
valuable UK insurtechs were founded after 2016. 
Insurtech is no longer a curiosity on the fringe of 
the UK insurance industry. It is a driving force for 
growth and innovation—employing thou sands, 
expanding coverage to underserved segments, 
and benefiting society as a whole. The UK insur-
tech ecosystem has the potential to help the whole 
industry transform. 

To reach their full potential, insurtechs can focus 
on creating “painkillers, not vitamins” by offering 
new products that cover underserved segments or 
cater to new risks. Identifying these opportunities 
is not easy, but it can be done by closely observing 
the changes in technology and living habits and 
proactively identifying those new risks.

risk and equity funding in one place provides a 
fertile ground for growth at various scales. UK 
customers are engaged, curious, sophisticated, 
and selective. And the regulatory environment 
supports innovation, meaning products that are 
certified will “travel well” and require less effort to 
be certified in other geographies.

However, navigating the UK ecosystem will require 
creativity. Later-stage funding may be more chal-
lenging to access than in other countries, which 
may require pivoting to meet investor expectations 
or proactive efforts to find international investment. 
Specific, hard-to-find talent could be accessed by 
forming deeper partnerships with incumbents or 
through international hiring. Finally, due to a high 
bar of customer expectations, the B2C space is 
becoming very competitive with few gaps; however, 
the B2B space provides many areas for innovation.

UK insurtechs can also take advantage of the fac-
tors that make the United Kingdom, particularly 
London, one of the best places in the world to test, 
iterate, and prove new products: the confluence of 

Through continued effort and innovation, the 
insurance and insurtech ecosystem can thrive and 
evolve and help pave the way to the insurance 
industry of the future.
