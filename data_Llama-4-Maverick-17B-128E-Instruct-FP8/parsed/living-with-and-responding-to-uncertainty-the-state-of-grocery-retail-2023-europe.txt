Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: EuropeForeword

For the European grocery sector, 2022 was all about inflation and growing consumer price 
sensitivity. This led to the biggest decrease in the margins of grocers in five years. In real values, 
turnover dropped by 7.1 percent, driven by intensified downtrading across income brackets. 
While margins are decreasing, interest rates and capital costs are rising. As a result, many grocery 
retailers see the challenge is financing the investments both in sustainability and technology that 
are necessary to reduce emissions, build resilience, and drive future growth.

This year’s report takes a comprehensive look at the key trends shaping the grocery industry 
in the coming years. How will the fact that consumers plan to save more money on food affect 
diffe rent formats, channels, and categories? Will grocery retailers need to look for further economies 
of scale to better deal with rising costs and increased margin pressure? To what extent are 
grocers equipped and resolved to leverage analytics and automation to drive productivity? As 
e–grocery largely retains the uplift observed during the pandemic and meal delivery grows, will 
more online offerings reach break–even in 2023? Finally, will more grocers join the ranks of the 
pioneers who already engage their suppliers to reduce greenhouse–gas emissions that occur 
during food production?

The State of Grocery report is an annual global publication covering three continents, with 
dedicated reports for Asia, Europe, and North America. This year’s report, “Living with and 
responding to uncertainty – The State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe,” is a continuation of a 
partnership between McKinsey & Company and EuroCommerce, designed to provide execu­
tives with a comprehensive view of the market and future trends. In preparing the report, we 
surveyed more than 12,000 consumers across eleven European countries and almost 50 grocery 
executives from more than 20 countries across Europe. In addition, we interviewed three industry 
thought leaders and pioneers. We combined EuroCommerce’s policy and sector knowledge 
with McKinsey’s global expertise and analytical rigor.

We hope this report will offer new insights and perspectives that will help grocers navigate a 
time of considerable uncertainty and set their companies up for future growth.

    Living  
with and 
responding to 
  uncertainty

In 2022, European grocery was characterized by unprecedented inflation and increasing 
consumer price sensitivity. Consumers traded down, and grocers experienced substantial cost 
pressure. The impact of the COVID–19 pandemic on the sector had largely concluded by the 
end of the year.

In the second half of 2023, we expect European grocery to start recovering. Key trends that 
will shape the sector this year include a gradual normalization of price and volume, a search 
for cheaper food, continued margin and cost pressure, a race for economies of scale, profitable 
online growth, retail media expansion, accelerated technology deployment, and intensified 
collaboration of grocers with their suppliers to drive sustainability.

Did anyone say inflation?
Inflation was the leading topic on the minds of consu­
mers, grocery retailers, and suppliers throughout 2022. 
General inflation in the European Union increased from 
2.9 percent in 2021 to 9.2 percent in 2022, reaching a 
peak of 11.5 percent in October. Food inflation was even 
higher—in some countries, as much as twice as high 
as general inflation. Household economy experienced a 
significant pressure as expenses increased much faster 
than disposable income.1 In response, many consumers 
traded down. 

Overall grocery sales in Europe3 grew by 2.9 percent in 
2022 compared with 2021. This growth was the result 
of 10.7 percent higher prices, a decrease of 3.6 percent 
in volume sold, and a downtrading effect of 3.6 percent 
(Exhibit 1). This implies total grocery volume at 2.3 
percent above 2019 levels, with significant variations 
among countries (see “Food and grocery market KPIs,” 
pp. 36–7)    

Across Europe, consumer downtrading has led to 
substantial growth for private labels. Compared with 
2021, the value share of private labels increased by 
1.9 percentage points. However, only 0.8 percentage 
points of this increase can be explained by same–store 
downtrading. The remaining part is caused by faster– 
than–average price increases for private–label goods 
(0.8 percentage points) and above–average growth of 
the discount channel, which has a higher private–label 
share (0.3 percentage points).3     

“In 2022, we were dealing with 
soaring inflation and an overall 
disruption of the supply chain in 
Poland, as well as with the  
impact of the war in Ukraine, 
our biggest neighbor country.”

– Luís Araújo, CEO, Biedronka

Discounters gained 1.4 percent in market share in Europe 
relative to 2021. This was largely driven by a combination 
of aggressive footprint growth in recent years, recovery 
from the pandemic–related sales dip, price inflation faster 
than market average and an increase in price sensitivity 
in the market. Discounters grew at the expense of all other 
channels: traditional trade declined by 0.8 percentage 
points,  hypermarkets by 0.2, online by 0.3, and super­
markets by 0.1. Online penetration mostly stagnated 
in 2022, except for the United Kingdom and Sweden, 
where it declined by about one percentage point.4 

Because of cost inflation, lower volumes, and more 
price–sensitive customers, the margins of many  European 
grocery retailers came under substantial pressure. 
 Between 2019 and 2022, the average margin of  European 
grocers decreased by three percentage points, our 
analysis shows. The EBITDA margin decreased by one 
percentage point, while the EBIT margin stagnated. 

2023:  
Are we out of the woods?
Consumer confidence is returning as inflation eases, 
although it is still below prepandemic levels. According 
to most forecasts, inflation in Europe will continue to 
abate over the course of 2023. Consumer confidence 

in the EU has been rising for five consecutive months; 
the level measured in February 2023 (–20.6, compared 
with –29.8 in September 2022) was the highest since 
the beginning of the war in Ukraine. That said, consumer 
confidence is still lower than it was in January 2022, 
before the war in Ukraine (–10.9) and much lower than 
it was in January 2019, before the pandemic (–5.9). 

Grocery CEOs also remain cautious. According to our 
survey of 47 European grocery CEOs, 44 percent expect 
2023 to be worse than 2022, and 33 percent think it will 
be as challenging as 2022. Only 23 percent believe 2023 
will bring an improvement in market conditions (Exhibit 2). 
Respondents agree that the key themes for 2023 are 
rising costs and margin pressure, downtrading, and an 
increased focus on private labels. 

Drawing on our consumer research (Exhibit 3), CEO 
survey (Exhibit 4), and market analysis, we identified 
eight trends (Exhibit 5) that we believe will shape the 
grocery landscape in 2023 and beyond. Some of these 
themes represent an acceleration of trends we outlined 
in last year’s report, while others are new and will likely 
prompt grocery executives to reassess and adapt their 
existing strategies.

Key trends

There are eight trends that will characterize the European grocery retail market in 2023.

Gradual normalization 
of price and volume

Retail prices take up to
12 months  
to follow commodity price evolution. 
Commodity prices peaked in Q3 
2022, so volume decline should halt 
as prices normalize in H2 2023.

in February 2023 compared with January 2023, taking 
the index 23.9 percent below its October 2022 peak.  
According to our analysis of historic data, food retail 
prices adjust to changes in commodity prices with a 
time lag of about six to twelve months. We therefore 
expect food inflation to slow down significantly in the 
second half of 2023.

1 Gradual normalization  

of price and volume  

We expect the first quarter of 2023 to be the turning 
point after which volume stays relatively stable and 
inflation gradually normalizes. 

In 2022, we saw retail volumes decline across Europe 
by 3.6 percent compared with 2021. However, most of 
this drop in volume happened in the second quarter 
of 2022 because of fading effects associated with the 
COVID–19 pandemic. In the second half of 2022, volume 
stayed mostly stable compared with the previous 
quarters.5  

We therefore expect that volume will remain stable or 
slightly decline through 2023 versus the fourth quarter 
of 2022 run–rate levels, with lower volumes in the first 
 quarter of 2023 than in the first quarter of 2022. Starting in 
the second quarter of 2023, we expect volume develop­
ment to be flat or only slightly negative relative to 2022. 
This would result in a volume decline of 1 to 2 percent for 
the full year compared with the previous year (Exhibit 6). 

While general inflation declined at the beginning 
of 2023, food inflation was still rising. However, 
food commo dity prices have passed their peak and 
 decreased significantly in the first quarter of 2023.6 At 
the time of writing, the global agriculture price index 
was 12.8 percent below its April 2022 peak. Also, the 
household energy price index decreased by 8.3 percent

2 A focus on cheaper food 

through private labels 

and discounters

Saving money on food remains a top priority for 
both high– and low–income consumers in 2023. 

All income groups were trading down in 2022, and the 
difference between income groups diminished. At the 
beginning of 2022, respondents to our consumer survey 
who said they wanted to save money on food  represented 
predominantly low–income households. Now, this intent 
can be observed across income brackets (Exhibit 7). 
The share of private labels increased across Europe by 
1.9 percentage points on average, and the market share 
of discounters increased by 1.4 percentage points (see 
“Food and grocery market KPIs,” pp. 36–7).

In 2023, consumers plan to trade down further. Accor­
ding to our survey, 53 percent of consumers say they 
want to save more money on food, and 36 percent 
want to buy more private labels than they did in 2022. 
Consumers also plan to spend less on premium, healthy, 
and sustainable products to make ends meet. That said, 
healthy eating remains a key concern for consumers. 
Depending on the income group, 24 to 37 percent of 
consumers intend to focus on healthy eating in 2023.

Even if market conditions improve, consumers might 
continue buying private labels and shopping with dis­
counters. Consumers are highly satisfied with private– 
label products, with 84 percent of respondents saying 
the quality of private labels is similar to or better than the 
quality of branded products. The average consumer is 
also quite satisfied with discounters. Our survey shows 
that the weighted average customer satisfaction score 
in Europe was 14 points higher for discounters than for 
other formats in early 2023. As a result, we expect that 
some consumers will not switch back from discounters 
to supermarkets. As the pressure on household budgets 
eases, supermarket operators may want to sharpen or 
upgrade their value propositions to lure target customers 
back into their stores. In 2022, we saw a strong correla­
tion between market share development and the attrac­
tiveness of a grocery retailer’s private labels as perceived 
by consumers. We expect this to stay true in 2023.

“Once consumers try a  
private label product, they are 
often pleasantly surprised by 
the product quality, and some 
of them stick with them.”

3 Continued margin  

and cost pressure

The profitability of grocers was hit hard in 2022, and 
the pressure on margins, cash flows, and the cost of 
capital is likely to stay high in 2023.

Margins decreased for both grocery retailers and food 
processors (consumer–packaged–goods companies) 
between 2019 and 2022. The EBITDA margins of grocery 
retailers decreased by 1.0 percentage point, while 
the EBITDA margins of food processors decreased by 
0.8 points (Exhibit 8). 

We expect cost and margin pressure for grocery retailers 
to remain high at least in the first half of 2023 because 
salaries are likely to grow and many cost  increases have 
not yet reached grocery retailers. According to our CEO 
survey, dealing with cost and margin pressure is a top 
2023 priority for 88 percent of grocery leaders. While 
energy and many food producer prices peaked in the 

third quarter of 2022, it will take time for these increases 
to affect food processor prices and ultimately reach 
consumer prices set by grocery retailers. In addition, if 
governments were to introduce new regulation to limit 
retail prices, this would put further pressure on the 
margins of grocery retailers. 

At the same time, the level of required investments for 
grocery retailers is increasing, putting additional pressure 
on the industry. Between now and 2030, the industry 
needs cumulative additional investments of €70 billion 
to €125 billion to drive sustainability, digitalization, IT 
improvements, and automation—an increase of 25 to 
50 percent relative to current levels.7 Margin pressure 
and the increasing cost of capital will make it harder 
for grocery retailers to finance these investments. The 
weighted average cost of capital has increased from 
2.6 percent in 2021 to 6.7 percent in 2022 because of 
higher interest rates. This makes it more expensive for 
grocers to borrow money or raise new capital.8

4 A race for  

economies of scale

Structural measures to achieve synergies and 
economies of scale are likely to intensify as smaller 
grocery retailers are disproportionately affected by 
current market developments. 

The current environment has placed significant 
demands on grocery retailers to manage cost. Scale 
has long been a benefit in the market. For example, 
bringing large volumes to the table in negotiations with 
leading brands can lower the cost burden substantially. 
Similarly, investments in technology and sustainability 
are easier to absorb if they can be spread and leveraged 
across a large network of stores. In a situation charac­
terized by increasing price sensitivity, margin pressure, 
and substantial investment needs, the value of scale 
will further increase.

In 2023, we foresee an accelerating race for economies 
of scale. Larger players may pursue more intense M&A 
strategies or seek to form broader partnerships—strate­
gies that have often proved valuable in times of turmoil. 
In contrast, smaller players are likely to explore alterna­
tive ways of achieving scale, such as through bundle 
 purchasing, joining franchising networks, and forming 
partnerships for joint investments. Some indications 
of this trend were already apparent in the second 
half of 2022. For example, Rewe has announced that it 
will  invest €5 billion by 2025 to expand its footprint in 
 Europe through targeted investments and smaller acqui­
sitions. Ahold Delhaize took on the Jan Linders chain 
as an Albert Hejin franchisee. Aldi North announced 
that it will exit the Danish market, while Coop Denmark 
is merging formats to capture synergies. The Scandi­
navian purchasing group Coop is teaming up with the 
French retailer Carrefour to make French, Italian, and 
Spanish private–label products available in the Nordics.

5 The quest for profitable 

online growth 

After a period of postpandemic stagnation, we 
expect that e–grocery will return to moderate 
growth and that players will maintain a strong focus 
on profitability. Incumbents will face increasing 
pressure from pure players. Meal delivery will likely 
overtake e–grocery in terms of market size.

E–grocery penetration stagnated in 2022, but we 
expect it to return to a long–term growth trajectory going 
forward. Most EU countries have retained the growth 
they have seen during the COVID–19 pandemic.

Increasingly, consumers consider online and offline 
as independent channels with different value proposi­
tions. In the United Kingdom, for example, according to 
our Consumer survey, around 75% of customers shop 
online sometimes or always with a different banner 
than offline. Consumers choose the best offline offer 
and best online offer for respective journeys, and this 
requires retailers to ensure a strong offer per channel. 

Some pure players, such as Rohlik, have already 
reached profitability and raised additional capital despite 
the challenging investor environment (see  “Interview 
with Tomáš Čupr,” p. 29). In contrast, quick  commerce 

players  (instant grocery) might face another difficult 
year as economics and investor sentiment  remain 
challen ging. In the long run, we still see a market for 
instant grocery in Europe, but with higher price points 
than mainstream online supermarkets. 

“I believe online can be more 
profitable than offline, as long 
as you don’t try to be all things 
to all people.” 

 – Tomáš Čupr, Group CEO, Rohlik Group

The market for meal delivery looks more promising. 
Meal delivery continues to grow more quickly than 
 e–grocery (Exhibit 9). If the growth trajectory continues, 
meal delivery will overtake e–grocery in terms of market 
size in the next two to three years. Given the higher 
margins of meal delivery, the potential profitability of 
this market is also attractive. 

Reaching profitability in e–grocery is a challenge, but 
we see an increasing number of players either reaching 
a break–even point or on a clear path to achieve it in 
the next year or two.

6 Retail media as a  

core profit center

Across Europe, top players are either launching or 
expanding their retail media businesses, which are 
likely to become a substantial EBIT driver for the 
grocery industry.

The emergence of retail media (RM) as the third wave 
of digital advertising puts grocery players in a favorable 
position to provide targeted advertising opportunities 
and helps boost their profitability. RM is highly attrac­
tive to advertisers because it allows for much more 
granular targeting than other forms of advertising. In 
addition, it allows advertisers to measure the return 
on ad spending (ROAS) much more accurately at the 
product level by using the retailer’s sales and web­
site data. In the United States, RM sales make up to 
10 percent of online food sales and yield EBIT margins 
exceeding 50 percent.

While RM is not a new phenomenon, there is a lot of 
growth potential yet to be captured in Europe. In 2022, 

the European RM market was worth about €10 billion, 
less than one–quarter of the value of the US market.9 
The European market is expected to grow to about 
€21 billion in 2025.10 According to a McKinsey survey, 
90 percent of CPG advertisers plan to increase their 
spending on RM in the next 12 months (Exhibit 10), com­
pared with a cross–industry average of about 60 percent. 
This spending will mostly add to existing CPG spend 
 allocated to grocers. To take advantage of this trend, 18 of 
the 30 largest European grocers have already launched 
or started to develop their RM businesses.

Looking forward, RM is likely to become a must–have 
for European grocers. Leaders are already scaling up 
their ecosystems beyond the core offering. For example, 
Carrefour has entered a partnership with Publicis and 
Citrus Ads to monetize joint capabilities and provide 
an RM platform for smaller grocery retailers (“RM as 
a service”). Ahold Delhaize has declared that it will 
buy stakes in the adtech platform Adhese. Tesco and 
 Sainsbury’s have announced TV network deals to lever­
age their data for tailored TV advertising.

 In 2022, the US retail media market reached $41 billion and about 12 percent of total media spending, while Europe reached €10 billion and about 7 percent, 
respectively. Total media spend based on Statista data.

7 Systematic scaling  

of automation and  

technology 

Technology remains an important driver of value 
creation for the industry, but it will require €40 billion 
in additional investments by 2030. Generative AI is 
emerging as a potential next frontier.

The automation of warehouses and stores continues to 
accelerate. In 2023, the EU–27 automation market for 
retail was worth €2.5 billion. It is expected to grow at an 
annual rate of 13 percent in the coming years, reaching 
about €6 billion in 2030. Grocery retailers increasingly 
automate their warehouses fully, including through 
automated picking and depalletizing. Automation is 
expected to be one of the largest investment categories 
required to enable the digital transformation of grocery 
in Europe. Cumulatively, the investment need will total 
about €18 billion by 2030 across the European grocery 
retail industry. 

At the same time, IT modernization is becoming a key 
enabler of the technological transformation of grocery 
retail, and it puts a strain on investment budgets. IT 
modernization includes the migration of older legacy 
systems that are no longer supported to new systems, 

the acceleration of IT development to keep up with 
pure players, cloud computing, omnichannel imple­
mentation, and the adoption of new analytical tools. 
These efforts will cost grocery retailers up to €19 billion 
cumulatively by 2030.11 However, IT modernization also 
offers a massive opportunity for value creation if it is set 
up and conducted as a true business transformation. 

Advanced analytics is becoming more mature, and it 
is increasingly part of the DNA of grocery retailers. We 
see more grocers moving beyond exploring and testing 
to building core capabilities for executing high–impact use 
cases. The EBIT margins of grocers can be improved by 
about one percentage point with analytics applications 
that were ready to deploy at the time of writing. About 
80 percent of this potential is linked to ten use cases, 
including pricing, store–specific SKU selection, and 
supply chain planning.

Looking ahead, generative AI (GenAI) has the  potential 
to unlock new value pools (Exhibit 11). The most promi­
sing  examples of GenAI applications are expected to 
be in marketing (for example, creating personalized 
creative content and messages) and customer inter­
action (for instance, enhancing conversational chatbots 
and virtual  assistants).

Exhibit 11

Generative AI creates additional value potential for retailers, 
with a focus on marketing and support functions.

8 Supplier collaboration to 

solve for sustainability

The importance of sustainability continues to 
increase for grocers, despite the current dip in 
consumer demand. While the investments required 
to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions are substantial, 
the necessary actions are clear. In contrast, Scope 3 
requires further understanding. 

cost and yields a positive net present value (NPV) – for 
example, investing in more energy–efficient freezers. 
However, these initiatives require substantial capital 
expenditures that could total €25 billion to €65 billion by 
2030 across the European grocery retail industry.13 

Since Scope 1 and 2 emissions represent only 7 percent 
of all emissions associated with retail (Exhibit 12), 
engaging supp liers and consumers to reduce Scope 

Regardless of the current dip in con­
sumer demand for sustainable products, 
the decarbonization of grocery is picking 
up speed, driven by the European Green 
Deal, the expectations of investors, and 
a shift to green debt financing. The num­
ber of retailers with operations in Europe 
that have set science–based targets 
for decarbonization increased from 56 
in 2021 to 110 in 2022. Among grocery 
retailers, this number increased from 22 
in 2021 to 36 in 2022.12

emissions generated

Scope 3 – indirect  
emissions from up and 
down the value chain

3 emissions will be crucial to reach 
net zero. Meat and dairy production 
should take priority, as these categories 
represent half of all Scope 3 grocery 
emissions.14 

To move the needle on Scope 3, retailers 
are starting to establish joint initiatives 
with their suppliers. For example, 
 Carrefour has engaged suppliers to 
commit to reducing their CO2 emissions 
by 20 megatons by 2030. Tesco has 
partnered with a bank to offer preferential 

Retailers have a clear understanding of the initiatives 
that are required to address Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
More than 60 percent of greenhouse–gas emissions 
in Scope 1 and 2 can be abated in a way that saves 

borrowing rates to suppliers that disclose carbon data. 
Programs for consumer  engagement are also emerging. 
For example, Kesko has launched an app through which 
consumers can set and monitor climate targets for their 
shopping baskets.

Implications for grocers

The current environment is challenging, but it offers 
 opportunities to grocers that act boldly. According 
to our research, companies that took decisive action 
during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 performed 
better throughout the crisis and experienced higher 
growth once the crisis was over than those that did 
not. On average, these outperformers reduced their 
costs more aggressively than competitors during the 
crisis, which gave them the capacity to invest in growth 
opportunities. They also divested nonperforming parts 
of their business (for example, certain formats) more 
systematically than their peers. Once the crisis was 
winding down, these companies were among the first 
and the most determined to make investments and 

acquisitions in attractive growth segments. Looking 
ahead, we see three strategic priorities for grocery 
retailers that will help them emerge stronger from the 
current period of disruption and uncertainty.

Strengthening private–label 
assortments and capabilities
A stronger private–label capability will help retailers 
 remain attractive while consumers are trading down 
and during the subsequent recovery period. Our experi­
ence shows that a broader and more attractive private–
label offering in the lower–priced part of the assortment 
shows the highest correlation with market share gains 
in the current market environment. To succeed, grocery

“Digitalization is the most important megatrend. One aspect of 
that is e–commerce. Another crucial aspect of digitalization is 
data leverage. This applies both to consumer data and  
operational data. Advances in analytics, artificial intelligence, 
and automation will help make our business more efficient.” 

 —Luís Araújo, CEO, Biedronka

retailers might want to take inspiration from the mind­
set and practices of leading CPG companies in the way 
they manage their private–label offerings. Additionally, 
they should consider building a design–to–win ap­
proach that revolves around key consumer needs and 
global trends such as value, health, and sustainability. 
To claim their fair share of growth during a potential 
recovery period in the second half of the year, retail­
ers should also start thinking about innovations in the 
premium part of their assortment.  
A strong private–label design capability will also help to 
differentiate the assortment offering.

Creating room for  
investments by acting  
boldly on profitability
To tackle cost and margin pressure effectively, grocers 
need to manage operational expenditure tightly. To 
create the necessary fact base for data–driven supplier 
negotiations and price setting, grocery retailers will 
want to examine how the prices for ingredients and 
other supplier costs (such as energy) are changing 
and seek to understand how this should be reflected in 
the purchase price of each product. Taking a cross– 
functional view of supply chain costs and looking at 
them end to end from supplier to store can unlock 
further opportunities to increase efficiency. In parallel, 
grocery retailers should seek to boost the productivity 
of capital expenditure—for example, by challenging 
infrastructure investments and reviewing store foot­
prints. Another important lever to free up funds for 
investments in future growth is to identify and divest 
parts of the business (for instance, store formats, 
channels, or categories) that do not yield enough profit 
and do not support the company’s strategic objectives. 
Moreover, grocery retailers will want to accelerate their 
online ventures’ path to breakeven. For example, they 
could tailor the online value proposition more to online 
customer needs, invest in supply chain automatization, 
and tap into high–margin adjacent opportunities such 
as retail media and meal delivery.

15   

“Decarbonizing grocery”, McKinsey, July 22, 2022.

Investing in future growth

While the two strategic priorities above represent 
areas of immediate focus for most grocery retailers, it 
is equally important to look further ahead and invest in 
future growth drivers such as analytics, sustainability, 
and e–grocery.

 — Moving from analytics exploration to imple­

mentation. To unlock the full potential of analytics, 
grocers need to shift gears from exploring and 
testing use cases to building the required capabili­
ties for implementing them at scale and embedding 
them into their daily processes. In our experience, 
80 percent of the value from implementing analytics 
comes from ten use cases, so companies should 
focus their management attention on these.

 — Collaborating across the value chain to reduce 

emissions. The required reduction in Scope 1 and 2 
emissions is often NPV–positive and should there­
fore be implemented as soon as possible.15 But net 
zero can only be achieved by collaborating across 
the value chain. Grocery retailers have an essential 
role to play in helping suppliers and consumers 
navigate the reduction of Scope 3 emissions, espe­
cially in high–emission categories such as meat and 
dairy. Generally, grocers should ensure that sustain­
able alternatives are available on their shelves and 
create transparency for consumers.

 — Gearing up for future e–grocery growth. While 
online shopping did not grow in 2022 and is still 
losing money on average, we believe it will reach 
profitability within the next two to three years and 
at least double by 2030. Investing in e–grocery now, 
and possibly also in meal delivery, might enable 
grocery retailers to overtake organizations that are 
currently reducing their investments.

“Because of our size, 
what we do has an  
impact on the whole 
market, and we take 
that responsibility  
very seriously.”

Nina Jönsson 
President and CEO, ICA Gruppen AB

PHOTO: ICA REKLAM

ICA is the leading Swedish grocery retail chain, with 
1,560 grocery stores in Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania.

Q: Over the past ten years, ICA has been among the most successful grocers in Europe. 
What are the key drivers of that success?

A: Our biggest asset is the entrepreneurship of our store owners. Originally, ICA was an association 
of individual store owners who came together to collaborate on things like purchasing, logistics, 
and marketing. ICA Gruppen was established only ten years ago, and to this day, anything that 
comes out of our central functions is thoroughly tested in a small number of stores and refined 
before we scale it up. Our store owners keep their ears close to the ground, and they make sure 
that we bring only the most promising new products or categories to the market. Additionally, 
they help us adjust our offering to whatever is required at the local level.

Another important success factor is our evolving ecosystem of adjacent businesses. Next to 
grocery stores, we also run Sweden’s leading pharmacy chain and a bank that has grown out of 
our customer card. Everything we do revolves around everyday consumption.

Q: What are your expectations on how market conditions for the grocery retail industry 
will evolve in 2023? What could that mean for a player such as ICA?

A: I think market conditions will remain challenging throughout 2023. The disposable income 
of consumers has taken a major hit because of the rising cost of living and because salaries are 
not growing as fast as prices. So there is a lot of price pressure that will lead to further polarization 
in the sector. In the past, consumers often did all their shopping with us; now, many of them go 
to discounters, at least for basic items. But at the same time, many people are spending more 
money at restaurants. So I believe that convenience will still be an important factor in the future. 
Consumers will always look for ways to save time and make their lives easier, and that is what 
we offer.

Q: Do you see indications of customers trading down more?

A: Absolutely. For example, we saw a big increase in the share of private labels in the fourth 
quarter of 2022, and I believe it will continue. Once consumers try a private–label product, they 
are often pleasantly surprised by the product quality, and some of them stick with private label.

I have no doubt that the share of private labels in the market will continue to grow, and we will 
keep investing in our private–label offering to take advantage of that trend.

Q: Do you observe any changes in consumer attitude toward sustainability? And how are 
you driving your sustainability agenda at ICA?

A: Right now, consumers are focused on saving money, so they are buying fewer sustainable 
products. Our share of ecological products is currently at an all–time low, around 3 percent. But 
I believe that this is a temporary dip. Consumers care about sustainability, and so do we. We 
remain committed to our sustainability targets, and we continue to invest in decarbonization.

“Right now, consumers are 
focused on saving money, 
so they are buying fewer 
sustainable  products.  
But I believe that this is a 
temporary dip.”

For example, we are reducing the packaging material of our 
private–label products. We also work with local growers as 
much as we can to avoid transportation of goods over long 
distances, and also because we know that our customers value 
local products. At the same time, we have to make sure we 
stay competitive. For example, when we tried offering only 
Swedish meat in our stores in Sweden, we found that the high 
price premium drove some customers to other players offering 
imported meat at much lower prices. But we are keeping 
sustainable options in our assortment. If we delist sustainable 
products now, they may not be available when the demand 
picks back up. Because of our size, what we do has an impact on the whole market, and we 
take that responsibility very seriously.

Q: What about meat alternatives? Is that a big topic for ICA?

A: It’s a very big topic. We believe that consumers will eat less meat in the future. We are work­
ing with a lot of smaller companies and start–ups that focus on meat and dairy alternatives. We 
need to have innovative products in our assortment to meet this growing demand. That is why 
we are committed to developing and offering products that are good for the environment and 
that taste good.

As vegan diets are becoming more popular, we also see a lot of opportunities for further 
differen tiation and innovation in produce. Our fruit and vegetable department used to comprise 
just a handful of products. Now, it has around 500 SKUs. Eating green is a huge trend in our 
markets. That trend will continue, and we will continue to innovate in this area.

Q: Do you observe any variation in performance across different formats? How does ICA’s 
multiformat configuration and overall positioning shape your actions in the context of 
current trends?

A: We have four different store types, but our customers don’t think about that. They shop at 
ICA. So we will decrease the differentiation between formats somewhat. All our formats need to 
communicate value for money, regardless of whether it is a supermarket or a hypermarket, and 
we need to have the best assortment in our catchment areas.

The main shift that I see happening in the market is not between formats but between channels. 
Channels that communicate exclusively on price have been the winners in the recent past. But 
not all consumers feel the same price pressure, and proximity is still key. So we focus on that, 
and we make a point of adjusting our proposition to the local environment in each store. 

Q:And what are your observations regarding e–grocery?

A: In Sweden, our main market, our online share is about 3.5 percent of total sales. Most of it is 

26

Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe

store pickup, rather than home delivery, because many customers are not prepared to pay for 
home delivery at the moment.

Now that COVID–19 seems to have run its course, the share of online is actually decreasing, but 
we believe it will grow in the future. The big spenders, such as families with kids, still want to 
save time, and online shopping helps them do that. So we will continue to invest in online. We 
believe it has the potential to reach up to 10 percent of our total sales.

In contrast, instant delivery and quick meals are not a priority for us, at least not at scale. 
We conducted tests in urban areas, such as downtown Stockholm, and they were relatively 
 successful, but we don’t think instant will be a major growth driver for ICA.

Q: How do you deal with margin pressure?

A: We have a major productivity program to achieve improvements in our operations, including 
logistics, and bring down costs across the entire organization. For example, we will increase the 
number of robots we use and take advantage of AI to make our operations more efficient. In 
general, we work on productivity to be able to invest in loyalty and value for money. 

On the supplier side, we still see some price increases, but we expect prices to come down in the 
second half of the year. Energy prices will remain high, though, as the war in Ukraine continues, 
and that means production will remain expensive, so we have to stay vigilant.

Q: What are the major opportunities for ICA going forward?

A: The vast amount of traffic we attract is a huge opportunity. Not only do we have a lot of 
shopper traffic in our stores but we are also one of the most popular websites in Sweden. For 
example, people who search for a good pancake recipe routinely land on our site, looking for 
inspiration and ingredients. The question is what happens next. What else can we offer them? 
How can we create pleasant surprises? The opportunities to increase our share of wallet are 
endless if we play our cards right.

More broadly, our ecosystem is a major source of opportunities. Take our customer card, for 
example. When banking interest rates were low, we introduced the best savings interest rate 
in the market in Sweden. Customers rushed to put money 
on their cards. Within the first two weeks alone, we saw 
millions transferred into these card accounts, and now 
customers are spending this money to shop at our stores. 
That is just one example of how we create synergies in our 
ecosystem of everyday consumption.

“We will increase the number 
of robots we use and take 
advantage of AI to make our 
operations more efficient.”

Q: Is there anything else you would like to share with 
your fellow grocers?

A: I’m very passionate about our sector as an entry point into the world of employment for 
young people. In Sweden, we are one of the biggest employers, and a lot of people find their 
first job at one of our stores.

As an industry, we have a huge responsibility to model our values, create a good environment, 
treat the people who work for us well, and create opportunities for them within and beyond 
grocery stores.

Interview

“The reason for our  
continued success is 
that we offer something 
that people don’t use out 
of necessity. They use it 
because they want to.”

Tomáš Čupr 
Group CEO, Rohlik Group

Rohlik Group is a leading European e-grocery retailer 
active in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Austria, Germany 
and most recently also in Romania.

Q: Rohlik is a fairly young company. Can you tell us the story of why and how you 
launched it?

A: McKinsey made me do it. Ten years ago, in 2013, McKinsey published a report on the future 
of online grocery in Europe. It listed all the barriers that were stopping people from buying 
groceries online: limited assortments, concerns about reliability, freshness, and speed. When I 
founded Rohlik in the Czech Republic one year later, in 2014, I made it my mission to clear away 
all these barriers. 

The core of the Rohlik proposition is same–day delivery. When we launched, nobody was doing 
same–day delivery, at least not in Europe. And we went even further. We brought the delivery 
window down to 90 minutes, and we created an unprecedented proposition in terms of assort­
ment differentiation, reliability, and service. If customers weren’t happy, we just gave them their 
money back, no questions asked. It was all about being customer friendly, and it really took off. 

Q: What about profitability?

A: We broke even in the Czech Republic after four years, in 2018, and we have been profitable 
there ever since. Our profit margin is well over five percent. The success in the Czech Republic 
helped us raise venture capital for geographical expansion. In subsequent years, we launched in 
Hungary, Austria, Germany, and, most recently, Romania. We have proven that the Rohlik propo­
sition is loved all over Europe, and we’re on the path to profitability across markets.

In fact, I believe online can be more profitable than offline, as long as you don’t try to be all things 
to all people. We focus on affluent customers in urban areas. Going forward, we will invest in 
warehouse automation to achieve further productivity gains. We will also make more comprehen­
sive use of AI and machine learning in areas like order planning. We know all our customers, and 
we know where all of our goods are at any time. For a lot of brick–and–mortar players, that is not 
the case, and we will leverage that structural difference to boost our profitability.

Q: Was COVID a major driver of growth for Rohlik in the past two years?

29

Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: EuropeA: Not really. We started scaling the business well before COVID. When the pandemic hit, we 
were already a €200 million business, with venture funding in the magnitude of €5 million. I admit 
that the lockdowns did accelerate our growth, but fundamentally, I believe that you don’t need 
external events to scale if you have a good proposition. We were growing at a rate of  100 percent 
before COVID.

Q: And did sales drop off when lockdowns were lifted?

A: No. We continue to grow at more than 40 percent, and it’s mostly like for like, because we 
didn’t really add cities. The reason for our continued success is that we offer something that 
people don’t use out of necessity. They use it because they want to. As I said, COVID did bring 
some new customers, and a lot of them found that they liked this way of shopping, and they 
stayed with us. 

Q: Now that the pandemic is over, a lot of consumers are struggling with the effects of 
inflation. Do you see indications of customers trading down more?

A: We don’t see much of it. The affluent urban customers we target don’t feel huge pressure on 
their wallets. They value our big assortment and the fast delivery we offer. And when people do 
trade down, we make sure they trade down with us. We make it very hard for them to leave us 
for another retailer. 

Q: How do you do that?

A: Value for money is key. The price per SKU is constantly increasing, so some people are 
buying fewer SKUs. In effect, they feel that they get less for their money. So to make sure these 
shoppers stay with us, we are pushing value for money.

Last year, we froze the prizes of basic commodities like milk, rice, and potatoes, about 60 SKUs 
in total. In some cases, our customers got milk for half of what they would have had to pay else­
where. So, essentially, we let people feed their families at last year’s prices.

“When people do trade down, 
we make sure they trade 
down with us. We make it 
very hard for them to leave  
us for another retailer.”

Looking ahead, it’s obviously a challenge to give consumers 
a good price without compromising your margin and your 
profitability too much. It’s not a big issue for us, but I see 
many smaller online players struggling with that, especially 
those that launched during the pandemic.

Q: The pandemic gave rise to a lot of instant delivery 
propositions. What are your thoughts on that segment?

A: There is very little room for differentiation in that space. 

Instant is driven by only a handful of SKUs, mostly snacks and drinks. The locations are tiny, 
and you have to have many of them. And if we offered the wide, differentiated assortment our 
customers have come to expect from us in those highly dispersed locations, we would end up 
throwing much of the stock away. Our share of fresh goods is around 45 percent. So instant is 
not particularly attractive for us.

Q: As you expand to new countries, do you find that your model is universal? Or does it 
require a lot of adjustment?

A: You need to have a local assortment, but the structure of the assortment is universal. The 
key is to focus on affluent urban customers. If you do that, the model will work everywhere. In 
Prague, we deliver to roughly 25 percent of all households. There are no exact numbers, but 
we can even reach revenues in the magnitude of 50 to 70 percent of Tesco’s offline revenue in 

30

Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europespecific micro markets in which we compete with them. That is certainly something worth 
replicating in other markets.

Q: And how are the big brick–and–mortar grocers reacting to your success?

A: There have been many experiments and discussions, but when it comes to real execution at 
scale, we don’t see many players trying, at least not in the markets in which we are present. 
One of the big offline players terminated its online trials three times while we kept growing. It’s 
a question of mindset. We would rather disrupt ourselves than be disrupted by someone else.

Q: Germany is one of your big bets for future growth. How will you address the high 
price sensitivity in that particular market? 

A: People say that Germans are so price sensitive, but we don’t really see that. It might be 
true in aggregate, but our target segment is different. It’s a question of how deep you go into 
the data. You don’t want to get lost in the average. There is a big base of affluent, demanding 
customers in Germany, and we are well set up to serve them profitably. The offline players we 
are up against in this segment need a high number of locations to achieve scale, and a lot of 
the high–end SKUs they are offering don’t move very fast. We don’t have these problems. In 
Munich, for example, we serve 30 percent of all households out of a single fulfillment center 
in Garching.

Q: Is it generally easier to succeed in e–grocery as an online–only player?

A: I think it is. You can’t just bring offline online. You have to start from 
scratch. That said, even pure play is far from trivial. It’s very hard to execute 
it well on a daily basis. But for offline players venturing into online, it’s even 
harder. For example, they will always struggle with consistency across chan­
nels in terms of assortment and prices. You might have to create a separate 
brand to solve that problem, and that is going to dilute your profit margin for 
several years.

Q: As you keep growing, what kind of people do you hire?

“We look for a founder– 
like quality in the people 
we hire. The will to  
innovate drives our  
success”.

A: We look for a founder–like quality. The will to innovate drives our success in the Czech 
Republic, and we need more of that as we expand to new markets.

Interview

“The core of our value 
set is our discount  
mindset. All our  
decisions are driven by 
our goal to transfer as 
much value as possible 
to our customers.”

Luís Araújo 
Chief Executive Officer, Biedronka

PHOTO: LUÍS ARAÚJO

Biedronka is the largest retail chain in Poland, with more 
than 3,000 stores in over 1,100 towns, and has been 
 present in the Polish market for 27 years.

Q: What are your expectations for the grocery retail industry in 2023?

A: In 2022, we were dealing with soaring inflation, an overall disruption of the supply chain in 
Poland, and the impact of the war in Ukraine, our biggest neighbor country. Throughout the first 
half of 2023, the situation will remain challenging. We still face high levels of inflation and supply 
chain issues. Consumer confidence will remain negative, and private consumption will stagnate 
at best.

The second half of 2023 will be different. We expect decreasing levels of inflation and a consistent 
recovery of the supply chain, which will allow for the progressive growth of volumes. In addition, 
we expect a progressive decline of fuel, electricity, and gas prices. At the same time, growing 
salaries will offset at least part of the negative impact of inflation on consumption. Currently, 
there are no signs of a recession. That said, we expect increasing levels of competitiveness in 
our market. All players will fight for volume and sales growth to neutralize the cost increases 
driven by inflation in 2022.

Q: What do you think will be the most important trends in the next three years?

A: Digitalization is the most important megatrend. One aspect of that is e–commerce, especially 
quick commerce. During the pandemic, a growing customer segment discovered the conve­
nience of shopping online. Biedronka is relatively new to e–commerce, but we are determined 
to turn our late arrival on the scene into a source of differentiation, especially with respect to 
sustainability, which is in itself an important trend. For example, we try to put as many of our 
couriers on bikes, rather than in trucks, and have them deliver orders in the proximity of our 
stores. We are also exploring delivering to delivery boxes, rather than to the homes of customers, 
to keep routes short and curb fuel consumption. Generally, we aspire to design all e–grocery 
systems with sustainability in mind.

Q: Do you think digitalization will change the game beyond e–commerce?  

A: Absolutely. Advances in analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation will help make our 
business more efficient. And as digital natives grow up, we will also see a progressive shift of 

Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe

33

communication from traditional to digital media, including social platforms such as TikTok 
and Instagram. We live in a society in which different groups of people align their behavior 
and follow those that are perceived as trendsetters in their respective peer groups. Going 
forward, we believe that influencers will play an important role in marketing, and we see this 
development as an opportunity to promote our brand promise and our value proposition in a 
new way that will resonate with younger customers. 

Q: You mentioned sustainability as an important trend in its own right. How does this 
trend affect the way Biedronka does business?

A: There is a growing preference among consumers for healthier and fresher food as well 
as for local production and distribution. In the future, consumers will pay more attention 
to the origin of products and the transparency of the supply chain. Fruit and vegetables 
constitute an important sales category for us, and we aspire to increase local sourcing in 
this area,  leveraging the fact that Poland is an agricultural country. Generally, sustainability is 
one of the top criteria we use when it comes to selecting and giving incentives to suppliers. 
For example, we reward suppliers that reduce their carbon footprints with higher sourcing 
volumes.

Additionally, our logistics system is designed to minimize the distance from distribution 
centers to stores and to maximize the number of stores served by each distribution center. 
We also have a program to reduce energy consumption and promote green energy all along 
our supply chain. Finally, we invest in eco–packaging, and we lead the market regarding the 
incorporation of environmentally friendly solutions in our brands and products. In the future, 
we will also take the lead on increasing the share of electric vehicles in the fleets we use. 

“Sustainability is one of the top  criteria 
we use when it comes to selecting  
and giving incentives to suppliers.  
For  example, we reward suppliers that 
 reduce their carbon footprints with 
higher sourcing volumes.”

Q: What does it take for a grocer to 
leverage opportunities around techno­
logy and sustainability?

A: The most important prerequisite is to 
have the right people. This includes both 
experienced workers and young talent 
with the skills that are needed to incor­
porate software and other analytical tools 
into the way grocers do business. As the 
European population ages, labor short­
ages will increase, and we will have to 

make sure we are well equipped to compete for the talent, knowledge, and skills we need to 
succeed, both at the level of individual companies and as a sector.

More broadly, every grocer needs a vision that is aligned not only with technological evo­
lution but also with the continuous evolution of the value proposition. Because change is 
expected to accelerate on several fronts, retailers will need agility to anticipate new opportu­
nities and adapt their practices accordingly.

Q: What do you see as the driving forces of Biedronka’s continuing success? 

A: First and foremost, it’s the quality of our labor force. Many of our leaders and managers 
have been with us for more than 20 years. They are fully aligned with the company vision, and 
they are connected by a set of strong, shared values. The core of our value set is our dis­
count mindset. All our decisions are driven by our goal to transfer as much value as possible 
to our customers. Efficiency, productivity, and cost minimization jointly form the backbone of 
a system that delivers the lowest cost possible and enables us to offer the lowest prices in 
the market.

34

Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: EuropeQ: In the first three quarters of 2022, your sales grew substantially compared with 2021. 
What were the predominant drivers of this growth?

A: Before the war in Ukraine, basket size was the most important growth driver. When the war 
began, traffic became the dominant growth driver. When inflation peaked in the third quarter 
of 2022, consumption and basket size started to deteriorate. Since then, traffic has been the 
principal driver of growth. 

Q: How much of the volume uptake was driven by customers trading down?

A: Downtrading is only a minor factor. We are gaining market share because consumers 
appreciate our promise to offer the lowest prices in the market, no matter how difficult the 
circumstances may be. We have the best price perception in Poland by far. The positive effect 
of this positioning predates the recent crisis. Even if the competition gets stronger, we are 
confident that customers will stick with Biedronka. Our commitment to efficiency and produc­
tivity enables us to protect consumers from price increases more effectively than the market on 
average. In the early days of the inflation surge, we even implemented an “anti–inflation shield” 
with a strong commitment to refrain from increasing the prices of the most frequently bought 
products in the first half of 2022.

Q: That sounds like quite an investment. What was Biedronka’s strategy to address cost 
pressure in 2022? 

A: We accelerated our technological transformation to increase 
productivity and decrease costs. One example is our investment in 
renewable energy. We aim to equip more than 2,000 of our stores 
with solar panels. This is expected to bring energy costs down by 
about 15 percent, and it will also help to reduce the emission of 
greenhouse gases.

At the same time, we keep investing in supply chain optimization. 
Most recently, we opened a new distribution center that helps reduce 
transportation costs. But the best strategy to deal with cost pressure 
is to fight for market share gains and volume growth to help dilute 
costs. This is the core of our strategy, and we will keep doing it. 

“The best strategy to 
deal with cost pressure 
is to fight for market 
share gains and volume 
growth to help to dilute 
costs. This is the core of 
our strategy, and we will 
keep doing it”.
