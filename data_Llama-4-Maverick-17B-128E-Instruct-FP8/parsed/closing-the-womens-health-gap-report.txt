For all the efforts to improve gender equity over 
the past century, the gap between men’s health 
and women’s health remains wide, whether it’s in 
research, data, care or investment.

And every person on the planet is affected by the 
women’s health gap, whether they know it or not. 
When we consider the impact of closing the gap, 
we are not just talking about women’s lives, but 
those of people we love, our communities and the 
world at large. 

possible with intentional, coordinated efforts. While 
there are many ways, large and small, for a wide 
range of organizations to improve women’s health, 
specific actions could create meaningful impact. 
Among these are investing in women-centric 
research; collecting and analysing sex-, ethnicity- 
and gender-specific data; enhancing access to 
gender-specific care; creating incentives for new 
financing models; and establishing business policies 
that support women’s health and strengthen 
women’s representation in decision-making. 

We know it’s possible to reach equity in health for 
men and women. In this report, Closing the Women’s 
Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve 
Lives and Economies, we’re pleased to showcase 
how the narrowing of the women’s health gap would 
allow 3.9 billion women to live healthier, higher-quality 
lives. It could also allow at least $1 trillion to be 
pumped into economic productivity annually, which 
reflects how narrowing the gap would lead to fewer 
early deaths, fewer health conditions, extended 
economic and societal capacity to contribute, and 
increased productivity. Of that, the largest impact 
would be created from women having fewer health 
conditions, letting them avoid 24 million life years lost 
due to disability and boosting economic productivity 
by up to $400 billion.

Women’s health encompasses more than women-
specific conditions, and achieving health equity is 

We invite leaders from the public, social and private 
sectors to review this report and find ways to 
bring their own contributions to filling the gap in 
women’s health outlined here. We are excited to 
see recent momentum in addressing this gap, such 
as the debut of the Women’s Health Innovation 
Opportunity Map;1 the recent creation of the White 
House Initiative on Women’s Health Research; the 
launch of the Women’s Health Interest Group from 
the European Institute of Women’s Health; and 
news that Australia is on track to become one of 
the first countries to eliminate cervical cancer.

In this multi-year research effort, the analysis  
backs up one of the core beliefs of everyone 
involved: that we all have a role to play in improving 
women’s lives. As Nobel Prize winner Malala 
Yousafzai once said, “We cannot succeed when 
half of us are held back.”

Investments addressing the women’s health  
gap could add years to life and life to years – 
and potentially boost the global economy by  
$1 trillion annually by 2040.

When discussing the challenges in women’s 
health, a common rejoinder is that women,2 on 
average, live longer than men. But this neglects 
the fact that women spend 25% more of their lives 
in debilitating health. 

Addressing the gaps and shortcomings in 
women’s health could reduce the time women 
spend in poor health by almost two-thirds. This 
has the potential to help 3.9 billion women live 
healthier, higher-quality lives by adding an average 
of seven days of healthy living for each woman 
annually, adding up to potentially more than 500 
days over a woman’s lifetime. Beyond the societal 
impacts of healthier women, including more 
progression in education and intergenerational 
benefits,3 improving women’s health could also 
enable women to participate in the workforce 
more actively. This would potentially boost the 
economy by at least $1 trillion annually by 2040. 
These estimates – while significant – are likely an 
underestimation given data limitations. 

In this report, women’s health is defined as 
biological conditions and general health conditions 
that often affect women uniquely, differently or 
disproportionately. There are many efforts to 
improve women’s health globally; however, this 
report focuses on the economic implications of 
the women’s health gap and the business case for 
closing it.

The root causes of the gap

There are four primary areas that need to be 
addressed to close the health gap:

1.  Science: The study of human biology defaults  
to the male body, which hinders understanding 
of sex-based biological differences and results 
in fewer available and less effective treatments 
for women.

2.  Data: Health burdens for women are 

systematically underestimated, with datasets 
that exclude or undervalue important conditions.

3.  Care delivery: Women are more likely to face 
barriers to care, and experience diagnostic 
delays and/or suboptimal treatment.

4.  Investment: There has been lower investment 
in women’s health conditions relative to their 
prevalence. This drives a reinforcing cycle of 
weaker scientific understanding about women’s 
bodies and limited data to de-risk  
new investment.

These factors play out in many different ways and 
to varying extents across regions and income levels. 
However, the evidence suggests that no geographic 
region or age group is unaffected.

Charting the way forward

Moving forward requires understanding the broader 
effects of the women’s health gap, and driving 
action on five fronts:

 –

Invest in women-centric research across the 
research and development (R&D) continuum to fill 
the gaps in under-researched, often undiagnosed 
women-specific conditions (for example, 
endometriosis, and pregnancy and maternal 
health complications), as well as diseases affecting 
women differently and/or disproportionately (for 
example, cardiovascular disease). 

 – Strengthen the systematic collection, analysis 
and reporting of sex- and gender-specific data 
to establish a more accurate representation of 
women’s health burden and evaluate the impact 
of different interventions.

 –

Increase access to women-specific care in all 
areas, from prevention to treatment.

 – Create incentives for investment in areas of 

women’s health innovation and develop new 
financing models. 

 –

Implement policies supporting women’s health, 
such as academic institutions adapting medical 
school curricula and employers creating 
pregnancy- and menopause-friendly workspaces.

An ecosystem approach, involving multi-sectoral 
stakeholders, is needed to accomplish these goals. 
It is possible to create better health for women, 
allowing greater workforce participation and, most 
importantly, the ability to live healthier lives.

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesIntroduction
Women spend 25% more time in “poor health” 
than men.

Over the past two centuries, the rise in life 
expectancy – for both men and women – has been 
a tremendous success story. Global life expectancy 
increased from 30 years to 73 years between 1800 
and 2018.4 But this is not the full picture. Women 
spend more of their lives in poor health and with 

degrees of disability (the “health span” rather than 
the “lifespan”). A woman will spend an average 
of nine years in poor health, affecting her ability 
to be present and/or productive at home, in the 
workforce and in the community, and reducing her 
earning potential.

B O X   1 : 

Terminology 

This report reflects women’s health as a market 
segment. The authors acknowledge the 
importance of healthcare to the transgender, 
non-binary and gender-fluid communities, and that 
not all people who identify as women are born 
biologically female.

The authors have often used the term “sex and 
gender” to reflect inclusive language and recognize 
the need for future research into health issues that 

is inclusive of the transgender, non-binary and 
gender-fluid communities. They also acknowledge 
the profound differences for women based on 
factors such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic 
status, disability, age and sexual orientation. 
Additional work and research should reflect how to 
tackle these barriers alongside the overall women’s 
health gap. In this report, the term “woman” 
includes those under age 18. 

Building on previous work from the McKinsey 
Health Institute and the McKinsey Global Institute,5 
analysts quantified this health gap in terms of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs),6 and the 
extent to which this difference is due to the 
structural/systematic barriers women face (Box 2, 
“Research methodology”). Addressing the 25% 
more time spent in “poor health” by women versus 
men would not only improve the health and lives 
of millions of women, but it could also boost the 
global economy by at least $1 trillion annually by 
2040. This estimate is probably conservative, given 
the historical under-reporting and data gaps on 
women’s health conditions, which both undercount 
the prevalence and undervalue the health burden 
of many conditions for women.

Critically, better health is correlated with economic 
prosperity. The women’s health gap equates to  
75 million years of life lost due to poor health or 

early death per year (Figure 1), the equivalent of  
seven days per woman per year. Addressing  
the gap could generate the equivalent impact  
of 137 million women accessing full-time  
positions by 2040.7 This has the potential to lift 
women out of poverty and allow more women 
to provide for themselves and their families. 
Addressing the drivers of this gap, namely lower 
effectiveness of treatments for women, worse  
care delivery and lack of data, would require 
substantial investment, but also reflect new 
market opportunities.

While improving women’s health has positive 
economic outcomes, it is foremost an issue of 
health equity and inclusivity. Addressing the 
women’s health gap could improve the quality of 
life for women, as well as creating positive ripples 
in society, such as improving future generations’ 
health and boosting healthy ageing.

The challenges women face when seeking 
healthcare play out in multiple different ways 
and in different diseases and sectors of society. 
When looking at the potential economic impact 

of addressing these challenges, all age groups 
and geographies could benefit, with most of the 
potential coming from women in the working age 
group (Figure 2).

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesEmbracing the full definition of 
women’s health

Women’s health is often simplified to include 
only sexual and reproductive health (SRH), which 
meaningfully under-represents women’s health 
burden. This report defines women’s health8  
as covering both sex-specific conditions (for 
example, endometriosis and menopause) 
and general health conditions that may affect 
women differently (higher disease burden) or 
disproportionately (higher prevalence). 

Research shows that SRH and maternal, newborn 
and child health (MNCH) account for approximately 
5% of women’s health burden,9 although this is 
probably an underestimate. An additional estimated 
56% of the burden is due to health conditions that 
are more prevalent and/or manifest differently in 
women. The remaining 43% are from conditions that 
do not affect women disproportionately or differently 
(Figure 3). Women are most likely to be affected by 
a sex-specific condition between the ages of 15 and 
50. Other conditions occur throughout women’s 
lives, but nearly half of the health burden affects 
women in their working years, which often has an 
impact on their ability to earn money and support 
themselves and their families (Figure 4).

Research methodology 

Assessment of the women’s health gap and the 
potential to reduce it:

Analysts used the Global Burden of Disease data 
from the University of Washington’s Institute for 
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) to forecast 
disease burdens up to 2040. This includes diseases 
leading to death and poor health conditions such 
as infectious diseases and chronic conditions.

To gauge how much the disease burden could be 
reduced, McKinsey thoroughly reviewed clinical 
evidence for the top 64 diseases affecting women, 
which account for nearly 86% of the global disease 
burden.12 It focused on around 180 interventions, 
based on guidelines from leading institutions such as 
the World Health Organization (WHO) and The Lancet.

For each intervention related to the 64 diseases, 
McKinsey examined the following factors:

 –

Identification of potential reduction of morbidity 
and mortality,13 scaled up to all diseases, 
considering the differences between men and 
women to identify the women’s health gap

 – Projection of total population and working 
population baselines with the expansion  
from health interventions and labour-force 
capacity interventions 

 – Estimation of the duration to realize the full 

benefits, considering both implementation time 
and the lag before health benefits appear

Cases with limited adoption data and correlated 
assumptions are detailed in the technical appendix.

Quantification of the economic impact:

To determine the potential economic effects of 
the proposed health interventions, analysts used 
population14 and labour force15 predictions up to 

2040. These health gains were converted into labour 
force involvement, productivity and economic gains 
through four avenues: fewer early deaths; fewer 
health conditions; extended economic capacity 
to contribute; and increased productivity. The 
assumptions for estimating the impacts were based 
on academic studies and verified by experts.

This analysis acknowledges:

 – Disease burden evolution: Unexpected events 
such as COVID-19 can change projections. 
The IHME’s disease burden data reflects the 
best available data. 

 –

 –

Intervention effectiveness: Given that evolving 
scientific evidence may be inconclusive, the 
research included input from academic and 
clinical experts.

Future innovations: McKinsey focused on 
advanced-stage technologies and consulted 
field experts.

 – Addressing the women’s health gap: Analysts 
assumed that if existing interventions are 
more effective for or more frequently adopted 
by men, the same rates could be achieved 
for women. If gender-based efficacy wasn’t 
monitored, it was assumed a similar gender 
gap to the ones for which data was available. 

 – Economic implications: This economic analysis 
makes assumptions about labour market 
choices. For instance, how age and health 
affect labour force participation. Evidence such 
as current labour force statistics and potential 
labour market changes were considered.

 – Data gap: Undercounting and undervaluing of 
diseases and their health burden on women 
likely leads to an underestimation of the 
women’s health gap.

How to read this report 

The analysis presented in this report includes an assessment of the health burden associated with the 
women’s health gap as measured in potential years of healthy life.16 This health improvement potential 
was then translated to economic potential, measured as contribution to gross domestic product (GDP). 
Sections 2–4 of this report are focused on health improvement potential (measured in DALYs), broken 
down by three root causes related to disparities in science, data and care delivery. The economic value 
of this combined health improvement potential is presented in section 6, where economic impact is 
measured in additional GDP. While this report focuses on the potential economic benefits of closing the 
women’s health gap, there is also a moral imperative to close the women’s health gap and to improve the 
lives of millions of women worldwide.

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesBiomedical innovation builds on the basic 
understanding of science around body function 
and the cellular and molecular pathways involved 
in disease development and progression. 
Historically, men have both led and been the 
subject of the study of medicine and biology.17 
The majority of animal models have been based 
on male specimens.18 Questions about sex-based 
differences were rarely investigated or recorded, 
with the assumption – now known to be false 
– that there are few important differences in the 
functioning of organs and systems in men and 
women beyond reproduction. To understand basic 
female biology better, fundamentally new research 
tools should be developed (for example, animal 
models, computational models, patient avatars and 
humanized models) that better classify women’s 
symptoms and manifestations of disease (as 
opposed to calling those “atypical”).19

There is a tremendous opportunity for the 
healthcare and life sciences community to improve 
the lives of women around the world. 

Effectiveness of and access to 
medical therapies may vary 

There are well-known cases where women  
and men experience important differences  
in the uptake or effectiveness of a medicine 
designed and approved for use for both. 
This is true, for example, for some therapies 
to treat asthma and cardiovascular disease. 
Analysts looked at 183 of the most widely 
used interventions across 64 health conditions, 
representing roughly 90% of the health  
burden for women, reviewing more than 650 
academic papers to assess the extent of this 
phenomenon. Of the interventions studied, only 
50% reported sex-disaggregated data. In cases 
where sex-disaggregated data was available, 
64% of the interventions studied were found  
to put women at a disadvantage, either due  
to lower efficacy or access, or both, while for  
men this was the case for only 10% of 
interventions. (Figure 5).

Examples include:

 – Asthma is a common respiratory condition 

affecting men and women at similar prevalence 
rates, where acute asthma exacerbations 
present as symptoms such as shortness of 
breath, wheezing, cough or chest tightness.20 
Inhaler therapy with bronchodilators and 
corticosteroids is a mainstay of treatment. But 
studies indicate that this treatment is around 
20 percentage points less effective in reducing 
exacerbations in women compared to men.21 

 – Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease – 
particularly ischaemic heart disease and stroke 
– is the biggest single contributor to disease 
burden globally for both men and women, 
accounting for 16% of DALYs globally for men 
and 14% for women.22 One German study 
found that despite identical technical success of 
a percutaneous cardiac intervention for men and 
women, there was a 20% higher age-adjusted 
risk of death or of cardiac events in women 
compared to men.23 

10

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesResearch in women’s health 
primarily focuses on diseases 
with high mortality, overlooking 
diseases leading to disability

One way to assess research priorities is through 
pipeline assets. There is up to a 10-fold higher 
volume of new therapies in development for some 
of the most common women’s cancers compared 
to debilitating gynaecological conditions (Figure 
6). One possible reason for this is the higher 
mortality rate of oncologic conditions. The solution 
is not to trim cancer funding, but to recognize 
the possibilities for advances in research related 
to other women’s health conditions, in particular 
menopause, premenstrual syndrome, endometriosis 

and polycystic ovary syndrome. Additionally, 
maternal conditions should receive more attention: 
while they contribute a similar share to overall 
suffering among women compared to women-
specific cancers, there is a large discrepancy 
in the pipeline of therapies in development. For 
example, even though postpartum haemorrhage 
(PPH) is the leading direct preventable cause of 
maternal mortality in low-income countries (LICs) 
and low- or middle-income countries (LMICs), only 
two new medicines shown to be effective in PPH 
management have been developed over the past 
30 years.24

In all, when tackling women’s health, the solution 
is not to divide more slices of one pie: it’s to make 
more pie.

How the lack of sex- and gender-
specific data and research 
affects safety

Since 2000, women in the United States have 
reported total adverse events from approved 
medicines 52% more frequently than men, and 
serious or fatal events 36% more frequently.25 

Healthcare professionals in the United States 
reported 4.4 million serious or fatal events for 
women versus 3.8 million for men in 2022.26 An 
analysis of all medicines withdrawn for safety 
reasons – a process that requires objective  
scientific review – shows that, since 1980,  
products are 3.5 times more likely to be removed 
because of safety risks in women patients as 
compared to men (Figure 7).

men vs. women.

The research conducted indicates that systematic 
lack of disease understanding created a women’s 
health gap of 40–45 million DALYs per year, or 
four days per woman per year. This is equivalent 
to around 60% of the total gap due to sex-related 
biology differences (Figure 1). This estimate 
includes the known gap for conditions that 
affect both sexes and an estimate of the gap 
represented by the average lower effectiveness 
for women-specific conditions relative to men. It 
also includes the “unknown” gap: this is where 
there is no sex-disaggregated evidence available 
for specific conditions that could, if it existed, 

potentially demonstrate levels of effectiveness 
difference comparable to conditions where sex-
based analysis is available. The longevity of women 
cannot explain the disparity: the effectiveness gap 
has a disproportionate impact on women and girls 
between 10 and 40 years old and in certain regions 
such as Latin America and Central Asia. 

Shining a light on the interventions for which  
this information was not reported would benefit 
both men and women, by enabling innovators 
to develop interventions that are better suited for 
specific subpopulations.

13

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesData can quantify problems and measure the 
impact of potential solutions. It is the critical 
ingredient of robust, evidence-based analysis 
and decision-making. Yet many of the datasets 
(epidemiological and clinical) widely used today 
fail to provide a complete picture of women’s 
health, both undercounting and undervaluing the 
health burden. When women’s health is invisible, 
there are missed opportunities to improve lives, 
especially among women and girls in vulnerable 
populations.27 A lack of data also leads to potential 
underestimation of disease severity and health 
burden, influencing both the care that women 
receive and the level of innovation and investment in 
women’s health. For example, there is an emerging 
body of evidence indicating potential gender bias 
in the measurement of pain, where women’s pain 
is routinely underinvestigated and undertreated, 
with implications for clinical and psychological 
outcomes.28 Collectively, these incomplete datasets 
can influence decision-making and have the 
potential to exacerbate the women’s health gap.

Gaps exist across the data 
value chain

Stage 1: Pre-data generation29

The data gap starts at the very definition of 
women’s health: there is a lack of consistent and 
aligned definitions and measurement scales for 
conditions and symptoms affecting women. For 
example, there are different definitions of health-
related burden associated with menopause or 
menstrual syndromes, and a lack of consistency in 
pain instruments and scales.

Stage 2: Data generation

This encompasses both epidemiological and clinical 
data, including the documentation of women’s 
specific symptoms and markers for diagnosis. 
There is little understanding of how some diseases 
manifest differently in women and a lack of data on 
the health-related burden associated with some 
women-specific conditions. For example, in the 
United States, 4% of healthcare-related R&D efforts 
are targeted specifically at women’s health issues.30

Stage 3: Data aggregation

Sex-disaggregated results are available in the public 
domain for only 50% of the interventions analysed. 
One study found that a quarter of clinical trials in the 
US had sex-disaggregated data. Further, clinical trial 
designs and end-point selection can fail to consider 
potential differences between sexes. Evidence 
for intervention effectiveness may be drawn from 
unrepresentative populations due to failure to recruit 
adequate numbers of women (and minorities). 
In another, in 2021, half of countries reported 
COVID-19 cases and deaths by sex, 14% reported 
COVID-19 hospitalizations by sex and 10% reported 
COVID-19 intensive care unit admission by sex.31

Stage 4: Data analysis

The metrics selected for analysis and publication 
may hide or dilute the experience of specific groups 
compared to others, and datasets gathered during 
the digital age have led to growth in machine-
learning (ML) algorithms. Neither this data nor 
the programs applied to it are de facto neutral. 
Without guardrails to protect equity, this technology 
could perpetuate structural disparities. Artificial 
intelligence (AI) experts have suggested that using 
counterfactual fairness and similar methods can 
mitigate bias in areas such as race and gender.32 

Women can face barriers to 
timely and accurate diagnosis 

There is evidence of significant and systematic 
differences in diagnostic assessments between men 
and women, which has an impact on the calculation 
of the accurate prevalence and burden for several 
diseases affecting women. A study conducted in 
Denmark33 across 21 years showed that women 
were diagnosed later than men for more than 700 
diseases. For cancer, it took women two and a 
half more years to be diagnosed. For diabetes, 
the delay was four and a half years. Analyses of 
US health records and studies indicate that fewer 
than half of women living with endometriosis have a 
documented diagnosis.34 

Comparisons of endometriosis estimates also 
indicate unexplained variations. The WHO estimates 
that around 10% of women of reproductive age 
are living with endometriosis.35 In contrast, the 
Global Burden of Disease estimates this figure to be 
1–2%.36 This discrepancy – an eightfold difference 
– means there could be anywhere from 24 million to 
190 million women affected worldwide. 

For women, the difficulty in getting a recorded 
diagnosis not only creates a barrier to care, but 
the resultant lack of recorded diagnoses filters 
into how investors or researchers prioritize needs 
and assess market potential. In endometriosis, the 
data gap is primarily due to delays in diagnosis, 
which is approximately 10 years on average.37 This 
leads to lower research investments: for instance, 
adenomyosis, the sister and highly co-morbid 
condition to endometriosis, has received two grants 
from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), yet 
it affects hundreds of millions of women across 
the world. In menopause, the challenge is more 
fundamental. While it is understood that most 
individuals who are biologically female experience 
symptoms38 at some point during the menopause 
transition,39 this is rarely counted or considered 
within classifications of health and disease. For 
example, the IHME Global Burden of Disease 
dataset currently captures the health burden 
associated with menopause within a catch-all 
category of “other gynecological diseases”.40 As 
a result, it is not possible to identify clearly the 
underlying prevalence, or the symptom severity (or 

14

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and Economiesdisability weight) associated with menopause in 
that dataset. Furthermore, some of the symptoms 
experienced during menopause, such as mood 
swings or depression, are often associated with 
other conditions, leading to misdiagnosis.41 

Gaps in understanding 
the effectiveness of health 
interventions

Additionally, there is a lack of data on maternal 
health overall, especially in LMICs, which can  
lead to inadequate healthcare services for 
pregnant women and new mothers. The lack 
of data obscures the full picture of maternal 
health needs, making pregnancy and birth more 
dangerous for women and creating challenges 
regarding which interventions or policies to 
prioritize. The WHO reports that every day in  
020 approximately 800 women died from 
preventable causes related to pregnancy and 
childbirth – translating to a death every two 
minutes – and most of these deaths occur  
in LMICs.42 

One example of the gap in clinical evaluations can 
be seen in US clinical trials. The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has had policies requiring 
investigation of gender differences in clinical 
evaluation of medicines since 1993,43 and in clinical 
trials from 2000 to 2022 women’s participation in 
oncology trials improved.44 However, in comparing 
women’s participation to their share of the disease 
burden, women remain under-represented in 
surgical trials for cancers of the bladder, head and 
neck, stomach and oesophagus.45 While women 
experience a greater share of the health burden for 
some diseases, such as in neurology, the ratio is 
not reflected in clinical trial participation. Additionally, 
equitable representation of women (and men) of 
different races and ethnicities has long lagged. 

B O X   3 :

Case study: COVID-19 vaccine development

In the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, 
a massive number of both experimental and 
observational clinical trials were needed. While 
representation of women was equal or better 
across trials, this was not reflected in consistent 
reporting of sex-specific results. One analysis 
found that when examining 41 articles on 
COVID-19 research, while 35 studies showed 

safety data, only 12 of these presented data by 
sex or gender.46 Less than 5% of investigators out 
of 2,500 COVID-19 studies had pre-planned for 
sex-disaggregated data analysis in their studies.47 
Where adverse effects and sex differences were 
published, adverse events were more common in 
women patients.48 

Ensuring sex-differentiated 
results

Today, only about 5% of trials report the number  
of participants by sex.49 The typical perception 
is that average results across large and 
undifferentiated groups may dilute the scale of 
impact for some but create a more unified picture  
of the value proposition.

Representative clinical studies capable of  
producing stratified results may involve larger  
and longer clinical trials, increasing costs and 
extending time to market. However, the results 
would likely lead to more effective interventions 
with higher uptake among patients. The risk/reward 
equation for investors becomes more balanced  
if payers (governments, insurers and patients)  
and regulators insist on evidence for cohort- 
specific impact.

There are conditions today that are believed to 
affect men and women equally, such as leukaemia 
or meningitis, but the research to identify potential 
differences is lacking. Stakeholders may explore 
how a systematic and proactive approach to 
designing and reporting clinical outcomes could 
take sex and gender into account. 

One route to start working with sex- and gender-
specific data analysis in general is through meta-
analytical techniques (i.e. combining study results to 
draw conclusions about therapeutic effectiveness) 
that can be used to analyse sex-specific efficacy 
without increasing sample size.50 Other analysis 
has found that investing in women as investigators 
could lead to more women being enrolled in trials.51

Addressing data gaps in women’s health would 
require concerted effort across multiple fronts,52 
potentially including requiring sex- and gender-
disaggregated data to further understanding.

Creating sex- and

care delivery systems
Patients benefit from care delivery that reflects 
sex- and gender-specific needs.

16

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesSeveral studies have indicated that women are more 
frequent users of health services than men.53 These 
differences, however, may be reduced substantially 
when adjusted for different levels of need, such as 
reproduction or differences in disease prevalence.54 
The McKinsey analysis finds that some of this 
unbalanced usage may be due to inadequate 
service. Compared to men, women who present the 
same condition may not receive the same evidence-
based care.55 These delays can add unnecessary 
costs to health systems, not to mention costs and 
stress to the patient and their family. 

Inequalities exist throughout the 
full pathway of care

The care pathway runs from awareness of a 
health issue to access to services and preventive 
care, timely and accurate diagnosis and effective 
treatment and follow-up. 

Awareness and prevention

Health education, including menstrual education, 
is one of the most effective ways to help women 
learn about their bodies.56 While every country may 
vary in the types and amount of health education, 
women around the world who experience 
conditions such as painful periods, endometriosis, 
polycystic ovarian syndrome or uterine fibroids 
may have limited awareness of what is normal and 
when to seek medical advice.57 Education can 
also improve school attendance, teach effective 
management strategies that reduce symptom 
severity and reduce potential fertility problems in 
the future, which are often excluded from health 
insurance policies.58

Prevention and promotion are also needed for 
better health. The human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccine, for example, is proven to reduce the 
incidence of cervical cancer by nearly 90%, 
particularly if women are vaccinated when they 
are younger.59 In 2020, the WHO launched the 
90-70-90 targets, aiming to have 90% of girls 
vaccinated against HPV, 70% of women screened 
for HPV by age 35 and again at 45 and 90% of 
women with pre-cancer treated or with invasive 
cancer managed. However, according to the 
WHO, there are great disparities among countries: 
today, less than 25% of LICs and less than 30% 
of LMICs have introduced the vaccine, compared 
with 85% of high-income countries (HICs).60 Some 
36% of women worldwide have been screened for 
cervical cancer in their lifetime, 84% in high-income 
countries and less than 20% in LMICs or LICs.61 

The importance of increasing awareness goes 
beyond patients – many doctors are not aware of 
how diseases can affect or manifest differently in 
women, preventing them from providing proper care 
to many patients.

Accessibility and affordability 
of care

Women may encounter barriers related to access 
and affordability. Healthcare spending and 
insurance premiums have historically been higher 
for women. For instance, in Switzerland, healthcare 
insurance premiums are more expensive for women 
because they are considered to have higher 
healthcare costs. On average, Swiss women pay 
more than 12% extra for supplementary hospital 
insurance, with greater disparities in specific age 
groups. A 31-year-old woman pays, on average, 
37% more than a man of the same age.62 Similarly, 
Indian private insurers employ gender-based 
premiums, leading to higher expenses for women.63 
Further McKinsey analysis of US co-pay rates finds 
American women have an average of $135 more 
out-of-pocket expenses per year compared to 
men. Of that, $55 is due to higher co-pay rates for 
conditions predominantly affecting women. 

Affordability means more than paying for direct 
healthcare services – it also means being able to 
afford hygiene products. For instance, around 500 
million people worldwide lack access to menstrual 
products and hygiene facilities.64 In Bangladesh, a 
study conducted by the HERproject showed that 
73% of women missed work for an average six 
days a month in a textile factory.65 This absenteeism 
negatively affects not only business but also 
the lives and livelihoods of women who are not 
paid for days they do not work. However, when 
the HERproject provided pads and other work-
based interventions (sharing information regarding 
menstruation, reducing stigma, etc.), absenteeism 
dropped to 3%.66

Family planning is also highly relevant. Women of 
childbearing age who are sexually active must also 
evaluate the cost of contraceptives, many of which 
are not covered by insurance. An estimated 257 
million women in developing regions who want to 
avoid pregnancy are not using safe and effective 
family planning methods, due to factors such as 
a lack of access and support, according to the 
2023 Global Contraception Policy Atlas.67 For any 
woman, a lack of contraception – which can lead to 
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or unintended 
pregnancy – can, in the long run, result in job loss, 
career setbacks, diminished ability to support 
oneself or one’s family and higher levels of “family 
dysfunction”.68

These disparities can be tackled. There are 
alternative models and systems helping to  
increase accessibility and affordability of care  
for women while also reducing costs for healthcare 
systems and individuals – this includes the US 
Affordable Care Act and women’s health hubs in  
the United Kingdom.69 

17

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesTimely diagnosis

The male-centric models of disease described 
earlier can contribute to delays in care and lower-
quality treatment decisions once a woman is 
within the care system. Women are seven times 
more likely than men to have a heart condition 
misdiagnosed or be discharged during a heart 
attack.70 More sensitive biomarkers to detect 
heart attacks in women have been identified,71 
and studies are ongoing to validate the impact 
on health outcomes, but medical school curricula 
and residency and fellowship trainings need to be 
updated to reflect these differences.

For maternal care, untreated tuberculosis may have 
a mortality rate of up to 40% in high-risk72 areas, 
where women often have lower uptake of treatment 
probably due to societal norms. One possible 
solution is the integration of tuberculosis screening 
in antenatal care for pregnant women. This strategy 
was tested in Pakistan and proved to be feasible 
and effective.73

Choice of treatment

Accurate diagnosis should prompt delivery of 
evidence-based treatment. But sex and gender 
can affect care, even for common conditions. 

For example, upon discharge, women cardiac 
patients are less likely to be prescribed secondary 
prevention to reduce the risk of further events.  
This (along with other risk factors) contributes to 
women being twice as likely to die from a serious 
heart attack.74

Outcomes after an acute cardiac event could 
potentially improve via sex- and gender-adapted 
protocols for guideline-directed management. This 
begins at admission and continues through the 
procedure and until discharge. One health system 
reduced outcome disparities with a standardized 
system-wide protocol including emergency 
department catheterization lab activation, a STEMI 
(ST elevation myocardial infarction) safe hand-
off checklist; transfer to an immediately available 
catheterization lab; and a radial first approach to 
percutaneous coronary intervention.75 A discharge 
checklist for guideline-directed medical therapy 
has been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure 
patients by 65% for both sexes.76

While some efforts to achieve gender parity require 
heavy investment, there are budget-conscious 
solutions with potentially huge impact. UNICEF 
Côte d’Ivoire Country Office, for example, produced 
a low-cost version of a uterine balloon tamponade 
device to treat maternal haemorrhage. The product, 
which uses a catheter and a condom, has a 95% 
success rate and has been scaled nationally.77

Women are

more likely than 
men to have a 
heart condition 
misdiagnosed or 
be discharged 
during a heart 
attack.

Intersectionality and health outcomes

This paper explores ways in which sex and 
gender influence an individual’s health chances 
and experience of health services. These 
differences are all too often further exacerbated 
by overlapping levels of discrimination 
and disadvantage, such as race, ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status, disability, age and sexual 
orientation. The effects are strikingly clear in 
maternal health (Figure 8). Within the US, Native 
American and Black women are 2–3x more likely 
to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white 
women. For Black families, this holds true even 

after adjustment for differences in income levels.78 
In India, a woman of upper caste is 3x more likely 
to use prenatal care and 5x more likely to have 
a trained birth attendant compared to a woman 
of lower caste.79 A study in the UK indicated that 
women from ethnic minority backgrounds have 
an increased risk of post-partum haemorrhage.80 
On a global scale, 94% of pregnancy-related 
deaths occurred in low-resource settings, 
with 86% occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and 
Southern Asia.81

Creating solutions to tackle 
care disparities

Overall, the gap in care delivery contributes 34% 
to the women’s health gap (Figure 1). Consider 
how sex- and gender-appropriate care delivery 
could reduce the women’s health burden by 25 
million DALYs per year globally, corresponding to 
2.5 days per woman per year. 

Global public health programmes are increasingly 
being designed and improved from a sex- and 
gender-informed perspective. This involves an 
investigation of the role sex and gender play 
in health outcomes, including health-related 
stigma, barriers to accessing health services 
and vulnerabilities to different health risks. For 
example, the Stop TB Partnership developed 
a gender-responsive tuberculosis delivery 
programme82 and associated investment 
package.83 One pillar of this approach is the 
routine collection, analysis and use of sex-
disaggregated data and inclusion of sex and 
gender in monitoring and evaluation.

Improvements in the diagnostic tools available 
would represent a major step forward for patients. 
Yet even without innovative tools, it would be 
possible to improve care and bridge the gaps in 
diagnosis with more consistent and standardized 
screening and data collection. Earlier diagnosis 
and a more holistic, patient-centric treatment 
approach could help improve disease and 
symptom management, prevent uncontrolled 
progression and resulting complications and 
reduce unnecessary treatments.

When it comes to affordability and access, 
counteracting the rise in healthcare costs while 
benefitting patients and insurance providers could 
be achieved through approaches such as value-
based care (VBC). VBC aims to link healthcare 
payments to the quality of outcomes, shifting 
incentives for healthcare providers from performing 
more treatments to delivering better treatments. 
These models seek to enhance care quality and 
reduce healthcare expenses by emphasizing 
prevention and high-quality results.84

VBC models in the United States include 
accountable care organizations (ACOs), voluntary 
networks of healthcare providers operating under 
Medicare. This includes the Medicare Shared 
Savings Program (MSSP), which returned $1.9 
billion in net savings to Medicare in 2020.85 
Outside of the United States, the European 
Hospital Alliance’s nine hospitals have also offered 
a blueprint that includes measuring costs and 
outcomes for every patient and bundled payments 
for care cycles.86 Value-based models are designed 
to reduce costs while improving quality outcomes 
for patients. For example, given the amount of 
time, multiple tests and providers a woman may 
see before an endometriosis diagnosis, a revised 
model of care could offer a holistic and patient-
centric approach that provides a faster diagnosis, 
reduces costs for a healthcare system or payer and 
ultimately improves outcomes. 

At a global level, AI, unbiased datasets and 
interoperable electronic records are potential options 
for enhancing care delivery. Ultimately, a combination 
of innovation, investment and ability to scale could 
unlock better care delivery solutions for women.

20

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesThere has been a historical underinvestment in 
women’s health research, from the public, social and 
private sectors. When there is funding, it overlooks 
the fact that many conditions manifest differently in 
each sex, creating variances in outcome.

Closing the health gap will require increased 
investment not only for understanding sex-based 
differences but also for addressing unmet needs in 
women’s health. Further, additional funding and new 
business models could support sex- and gender-
appropriate care.

Research funding neglects 
women’s health

Re-examining policies that are based on actual 
population needs is one approach. Public funding 
continues to be one of the primary sources for 
scientific research. In the US, up to 45% of basic 
and applied research in life sciences is funded 
through federal and non-federal sources.87 The 
importance of public funding is even higher if we 
consider that for life sciences companies to reach 
later-stage development they rely on results from 
basic and applied research.88 While women’s health 
funding data by country can be scarce, the NIH 
allocates 11% of its budget to women’s health-
specific research in the US; despite women having 
a 50% higher mortality rate the year following a 
heart attack, only 4.5% of the NIH’s budget for 

coronary artery disease supports women-focused 
research.89 In Canada and the UK, 5.9% of grants 
between 2009 and 2020 looked at female-specific 
outcomes or women’s health.90

In another example, as of 2015 there were five 
times more scientific studies on erectile dysfunction 
than premenstrual syndrome.91 In a trial where the 
medication sildenafil citrate was shown to relieve 
menstrual pain, research stopped due to a lack of 
funding.92 These examples reflect how underfunding 
certain research leads to and augments the 
women’s health gap. One goal could be for existing 
budgets to be more fairly distributed to reflect the 
disease burden and unmet need.

When governments and non-profits evaluate 
resources and policies across populations, they 
create an opportunity to advance health equity 
and benefit society. They could consider which 
investments reap the highest socioeconomic return, 
including in medical research. One example of 
targeted investment is the 3not30 campaign by 
the Women’s Health Access Matters to increase 
women’s health research and accelerate investment 
in sex-based research over the next three years.93

There remain many attractive, untapped 
opportunities in women’s health. Currently, 
global life sciences R&D efforts primarily focus 
on conditions with a high contribution of years of 
life lost (YLL) to the overall DALY. This has often 
disadvantaged women because they have a higher

affect quality of life (years lived with a disability, 
YLDs) rather than length of life (YLL), such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, endometriosis, uterine fibroids 
or diabetes. For example, the disability weight 
for someone with moderate abdominal pain and 
primary infertility due to endometriosis is 0.121; for 
moderate rheumatoid arthritis (RA), it is 0.3017. 
This translates to a person being willing to trade 
a year of their life to avoid 8.3 years of living with 
endometriosis, or trade a year of life to avoid 3.2 
years with RA.

Additionally, gynaecological conditions, such as 
endometriosis and uterine fibroids, which affect  

up to 68%94 of women, have 26 assets in the 
pipeline. Comparatively, other conditions may 
affect a lower percentage but have more assets 
(Figure 9).

Addressing sex-specific conditions can pay 
off: for example, the debut of Viagra for erectile 
dysfunction, which affected an estimated 152 
million men in 1995, generated $400 million in 
sales revenue within its first three months in the US 
market in 1998.95 By 2012, worldwide sales hit a 
record $2.1 billion.96 Given the similar prevalence 
and high unmet need for conditions such as 
endometriosis and menopause, there is enormous 
potential for innovative treatments (Box 5).

B O X   5 :

Endometriosis and menopause market potential

Globally, 190 million women97 are suffering from 
endometriosis. Currently no cure exists and 
treatments focus on symptom management. 
Based on prevalence and high unmet need, the 
market potential for endometriosis treatments is 
estimated at $180–220 billion globally (Figure 10) 
based on today’s share of endometriosis patients 
seeking treatment. Innovation in this space, 
including faster diagnosis rates and earlier access 
to treatment, could increase the market potential.

Menopause is also an area of high unmet need 
globally. Based on the age distribution of the 
population and share of symptomatic cases, it 
is estimated that more than 450 million women 
worldwide have menopause or peri-menopause 
symptoms (Figure 10).98 Based on the prevalence, 
the impact menopause has on women’s life, the 
high unmet need and the share of women seeking 
treatment today, the estimated market potential for 
medication is $120–$230 billion globally.99

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesThere is enormous potential around treatments for 
sex- or gender-specific conditions. For example, 
there is high interest in breast cancer R&D (646 
assets in the pipeline), and sales revenues from 
breast cancer treatments were at $18 billion in 2022 
(comparatively, sales for prostate cancer treatments 
were $11 billion in 2022).100 There remains an 
opportunity to improve outcomes of breast cancer 
in LMICs, where the fatality rate – 72% – was 
higher than the incidence rate (62%).101 Globally, 
endometriosis, uterine fibroids and menopause are 
among the conditions with high unmet need and 
economic potential. 

Private equity/venture capital 
investors are increasing 
investments in women’s health, 
with excitement about digital 
health solutions

Private equity and venture capital investments in 
women’s health are starting to grow quickly as 
opportunities in women’s health become clearer 
and more female technology (FemTech) start-ups 
set out to disrupt the healthcare market.102 Within 
the FemTech space, there is a concentration of 
activity concerning maternal health patient support, 

consumer menstrual products, gynaecological 
devices and fertility solutions.103 

The start-ups making the top deals in the past 
four years mainly focus on men’s sexual and 
overall health. A McKinsey analysis found that 11 
start-ups addressing erectile dysfunction, among 
other men’s health concerns, secured $1.24 billion 
in 2019–2023, while eight start-ups addressing 
endometriosis received $44 million. Funding for 
companies focusing on erectile dysfunction was six 
times higher compared to endometriosis. However, 
investors may be starting to see the potential. In 
the past four years, women’s health newcomers 
received $2.2 billion in funding. Some 60% of the 
top deals exclusively addressed women’s health, 
specifically endometriosis, fertility among women 
and maternal and neonatal health.104

Digital health is another potential avenue for 
innovation, with the potential to make health 
more equitable.105 In the digital healthcare space, 
FemTech companies received 3% of the total digital 
health funding.106 

Given the large unmet need and resulting 
opportunity, those who continue to forgo  
investing in women’s health may find themselves 
left behind by the players that tap into this high-
potential market.

24

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesThe disparities in women’s health affect not only 
women’s quality of life but also their economic 
participation and ability to earn a living for 
themselves and their families. Health is intricately 
linked to economic productivity, prospects for 
prosperity and contribution to economic output. 
Economic growth over the past 70 years has  
been closely tied to women’s increased labour  
force participation. Therefore, it is not surprising  
that the gap in women’s health results in lost 
economic potential.

Addressing the additional health burden women 
face could boost the global economy by adding at 
least $1 trillion to the global economy by 2040. This 
means a 1.7% increase in the average per capita 
GDP generated by women. 

positions by 2040. This would enable women 
to secure an income to support themselves and 
their families and has the potential to lift more 
women out of poverty. Beyond limiting individual 
women, the women’s health gap directly affects the 
global economy by impairing women’s economic 
participation and productivity. Chronic diseases are 
often linked to extended absences from work,110 
and poor health also causes “presenteeism”, where 
individuals cannot perform at their full capacity, 
reducing productivity. Finally, informal caregiving 
obligations and disabilities can limit affected 
individuals from full workforce participation. 

Better health often means being 
able to work more effectively

Women’s economic participation 
has been and will be a major 
driver of economic growth

Extended participation by women boosts economies 
and GDP growth.107 The rise in the number of 
women in formal economic activities since the 1950s 
has been a major driver of economic growth and 
wage increases.108 In a 2023 poll, when women 
around the world were asked if they preferred to 
work in paid jobs, care for their families or do both, 
70% said they preferred to work in paid jobs.109 
Addressing the gap could generate the equivalent 
impact of 137 million women accessing full-time 

The health disparities outlined in this report affect 
individuals of all age groups, with about 50% of  
the burden impacting women of working age. 
Women with fewer health conditions could add 
1.7% in GDP. Comparatively, if the status quo 
remained, the World Bank estimates an annual  
GDP growth of 2.7%, 2.9% and 3.4% for 2023, 
2024 and 2025, respectively.111 

Looking at the different channels affecting GDP, the 
largest impact would also be created through fewer 
health conditions, amounting to around $400 billion, 
or avoiding 24 million years lived with disability.
Expanded participation and increased productivity 
contribute more than 20% of total impact.

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesThe top 10 conditions alone 
contribute more than 50% of  
the economic impact 

On a global level, there are 10 conditions, such 
as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), depressive 
symptoms and migraines, that, if addressed, could 
make up more than 50% of the economic impact 
(Figure 12). This indicates which conditions could 
be prioritized globally. For example, addressing 
PMS has the potential to contribute $115 billion to 
the global economy. Rather than defaulting to PMS 
being a “part of life”, there are ways to manage 
symptoms. A 2020 analysis found that women who 
took calcium supplements experienced fewer PMS 
symptoms, such as anxiety or water retention, than 
women who took a placebo.112 A study in Iran found 
that the severity and frequency of PMS symptoms 
was significantly lower in an intervention group 
that offered education and coping strategies.113 By 

addressing PMS with effective interventions, women 
could experience less pain, experience better 
quality of life and feel more able to work.

Regional disease burden and healthcare status will 
lead to conditions having the greatest economic 
impact in different countries. When examining 
economic impact, rather than DALY impact, more 
weight is given to conditions that affect people 
during years of working age, as that is when 
economic contribution is highest. Conditions such 
as ischaemic heart disease may affect more people, 
but if the burden of morbidity and premature 
mortality happens after the usual age of retirement, 
the economic impact is more limited.

Additionally, other conditions not listed could be 
the underlying cause for the top 10 conditions.  
For example, infertility can lead to significant 
anxiety, depression symptoms and other 
psychological distress.114

for regional socioeconomic and healthcare factors

Across the four channels, the highest GDP impact 
relative to women’s GDP is observed in HICs and 
LICs (Figure 14). For LICs, most of the impact 
comes from fewer early deaths and fewer health 

conditions. Both upper-middle income (UMIC) and 
lower-middle income (LMIC) regions exhibit an 
overall lower projected GDP impact.

Endometriosis and menopause have a substantial impact on women’s ability to work and 
earning potential

Endometriosis and menopause not only cause 
women pain and reduce their quality of life but also 
substantially affect their ability to work and their 
earning potential. Roughly 80% of affected women 
state that menopause interferes with their lives, 
and one-third of these women also experience 
depression.115 Further, menopause is linked to 
premature departure from the workforce.116 

Similarly, endometriosis is linked to loss in 
productivity and absenteeism.117 For both 
conditions, prevalence and disease burden are 
heavily underestimated. This analysis factors in 

the actual economic impact for both conditions. 
Studies have found up to 90% of women reported 
menopausal symptoms during the transition.118 
This leads to a global prevalence of more than 
450 million women and highlights the vast 
underestimate (versus 35 million in the IHME 
database). For endometriosis, IHME places the 
number of cases at 24 million, whereas the WHO 
puts the prevalence at 190 million.119 Based on 
these adjusted numbers, improving effectiveness, 
uptake, access and delivery of care for these 
conditions alone could give a $130 billion uplift to 
the global economy by 2040.

Investing in women’s health 
shows positive return on 
investment (ROI): for every $1 
invested, ~$3 is projected in 
economic growth

Investing in improving women’s health not only 
improves women’s quality of life but also enables 
them to participate more actively in the workforce 
and make a living. The potential value created 
through women’s higher economic participation and 
productivity exceeds the costs of implementation 
by a ratio of $3 to $1 globally. This estimate is 
based on the net annual costs associated with 
the additional uptake of interventions required 
to address the women’s health gap, including all 
relevant interventions considered cost-effective 
in each setting.120 The analysis compared this to 
the additional economic potential that could be 

unlocked by the health improvements associated 
with these interventions. 

The expected economic return is greatest in 
higher-income settings, where the ratio is around 
$3.5 returned to $1 invested. More investment is 
probably needed in some LICs to establish the 
basic health infrastructure required to support low-
cost delivery of high-quality health services, as well 
as to create better and more rewarding economic 
opportunities for women. Still, the analysis indicates 
that the overall benefit would exceed the costs even 
in these settings, at a rate of around $2 returned to 
$1 invested. 

The analysis examines only the direct costs of 
addressing the gaps in care delivery identified. In 
the longer term, a range of greater positive returns 
is possible, given that improvement in the lives of 
women influences the heath and resilience of their 
families and communities.

Call to action: How 
to close the women’s 
health gap
To improve health equity and encourage 
economic growth, stakeholders need to develop 
a cooperative and comprehensive strategy.

30

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesAs noted in this report, women’s health has been 
under-researched and women face different 
challenges from men in affordability and access to 
treatment. This health gap creates unnecessary 
suffering and preventable economic losses.

It does not have to be this way. Through 
collaborative efforts on five fronts, a more equitable 
and healthy future is possible. There is an 
opportunity to close the women’s health gap by (1) 
investing in women-centric R&D, (2) strengthening 
the collection and analysis of sex- and gender-
disaggregated data, (3) enhancing access to 
gender-specific care, (4) encouraging investments 
in women’s health innovation and (5) examining 
business policies to support women.

Invest in women-centric research 
to fill the knowledge and 
data gaps in women-specific 
conditions, as well as in diseases 
affecting women differently and/or 
disproportionately

The women’s health gap could be narrowed 
by increasing funding to achieve equality with 
investments in funding for men’s health and 
from protocols that set standards of equity and 
diversity. Scientists, life science companies 
(pharma, biotech, MedTech), healthcare providers 
and others in the healthcare ecosystem may 
consider how the traditional understanding of 
disease is focused primarily on the male body.  
A more in-depth understanding of these 
differences would enable more effective care 
interventions and improved health outcomes. 
One example of venture capital-backed funding 
addressing this disparity is Repro Grants,  
which allots up to $100,000 for research  
projects aimed at deepening understanding  
of female reproductive biology. 

For conditions that affect women differently or 
disproportionately, more effective interventions 
start with clinical trials designed with inclusivity at 
their core, informed by preclinical research using 
female animal models. Specifically, there should be 
stronger diversity, equity and inclusion guidelines 
for clinical trial design. Guidance could incorporate 
male versus female disease prevalence mix and use 
sex-specific thresholds for biomarkers, to yield an 
adequate patient representation in clinical trials. 

Equitable representation by prevalence also 
implies more diverse research organizations. Life 
science companies, academic institutions and 
educational bodies should ensure that women 
and people of colour not only find representation 
but are actively involved in research, leadership 
and decision-making roles. For example, 
women form almost 70% of the global health 
and social workforce but it is estimated they 

hold only 25% of senior roles.121 The benefits of 
increasing women’s representation are manifold: 
for example, teams boasting diverse gender 
representation have been associated with higher 
levels of accountability and effectiveness.122 In one 
study that analysed more than 440,000 medical 
patents filed from 1976 through to 2010, patented 
biomedical inventions created by women were up 
to 35% more likely to benefit women’s health than 
biomedical inventions created by men. The patents 
from women were more likely to address women-
specific conditions such as breast cancer and 
postpartum preeclampsia, as well as conditions that 
disproportionately affect women, such as lupus.123 

Systematically collect and 
analyse sex-, ethnicity- and 
gender-specific data to have 
more accurate representation of 
women’s health burden and the 
impact of different interventions

The prevalence of conditions such as  
endometriosis and menopause is underestimated, 
leading investors and life science companies 
to underestimate the market potential of these 
conditions and underinvest. By accurately 
assessing and reporting on the prevalence of  
such conditions, national health institutes and  
other authorities may direct additional funding  
to the research and treatment of these  
underserved conditions. 

Beyond epidemiological data, today’s technology 
makes the systematic collection and analysis 
of sex-, race- and gender-disaggregated data 
simpler at all stages of the R&D process. Life 
science companies could harness this capability to 
strengthen the collection, analysis and reporting of 
disaggregated data at each stage of the process. 
This approach to data has the potential to enable 
life sciences companies to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of their pipeline products more accurately, 
including by adjusting formulations and dosages. 
This could yield better health outcomes and a 
higher probability of success. To further encourage 
the shift towards disaggregated data, the Women’s 
Health Innovation Opportunity Map 2023124 
proposes establishing sex as a biological variable. 
This would enable national health departments 
and international health organizations to develop 
and enforce guidelines regarding disaggregation 
of data by sex and gender in research studies and 
health surveys.

Biotech, MedTech and FemTech enterprises also 
have exciting opportunities related to AI and ML, 
which ensures that these models do not exacerbate 
existing biases or violate patient privacy rules. 
Developing robust, secure and holistic datasets 
could enable companies to differentiate in an 
overcrowded marketplace.

31

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesEnhance access to gender-
specific care, from prevention to 
diagnosis and treatment

In addition, two actions to help close the gap are:

Create incentives for new financing models to 
close the women’s health gap

Women deserve the same high-quality level of 
care from their healthcare providers as men, which 
doesn’t mean the same care per se. There is a 
pressing need to redesign medical curricula as 
well as residency and fellowships to reflect sex and 
gender differences. In addition to medical schools, 
continuing medical education organizations 
and credentialling entities could assess whether 
healthcare providers are receiving the latest 
information and training on the women’s health gap 
and sex- and gender-based differences. Current 
and future healthcare professionals of all specialties 
must be equipped with accurate and updated 
knowledge of biological differences, including 
sex-specific manifestations of symptoms. Future 
certification or tests could include questions meant 
to address whether providers have internalized  
this knowledge. 

Next, the path to excellence in clinical care lies 
in acknowledging and rectifying inherent equity 
disparities. Gender- and sex-responsive services 
benefit patients, healthcare providers and society 
at large. Health systems could implement new 
guidelines and protocols (for example, sex-specific 
cut-offs for biomarkers, discharge checklists) 
to guide decision-making and minimize biases. 
Similarly, life science companies could include sex-
specific evidence and outcomes on product 
package inserts/labels to inform healthcare 
professionals on the best regimen for different 
subpopulations.125

To reduce maternal mortality globally, investing 
in the training and upskilling of midwives could 
save an estimated 4.3 million lives per year and 
prevent roughly two-thirds of maternal deaths, 
64% of newborn deaths and 65% of stillbirths while 
contributing to the economic development and 
empowerment of women.126 

Governments, educational bodies, philanthropic 
institutions and many other stakeholders can use 
this moment to raise awareness of the sex-specific 
manifestations of disease – for example, ensuring 
that newly diagnosed endometriosis patients 
have access to up-to-date resources, including 
which trials they could potentially participate in. 
Healthcare entities, philanthropic organizations 
or community health workers could start or 
reinvigorate in-person support groups for conditions 
such as endometriosis or menopause, or for mental 
health support. Collectively, better education and 
resources, plus new diagnostics, are among the 
ways to potentially elevate the quality of healthcare 
women receive. 

Historically, given lower levers of investments overall 
for women’s health under the traditional financing 
model schemes, new financing models have a 
critical role to play. These models can accelerate 
innovation: one example is the Advance Market 
Commitment (AMC) geared at COVID-19 vaccine 
development and deployment.

Research and reliable data on the women’s health 
landscape can help spur investment. For investors, 
the gender-based healthcare landscape presents 
a mosaic of unexplored opportunities. By pivoting 
towards these opportunities, they can channel 
funds into high-impact areas, bridge the data gap 
and enable more investment and innovation.

Governments could explore policies that encourage 
sex- and gender-responsive health research and 
services; for example, by earmarking funding, 
providing tax incentives, lowering application 
fees, expediting the drug approval process and 
more. Philanthropic organizations, donors and 
international bodies could offer grants and prizes 
at a national or local level to spur innovation, while 
supporting capacity-building in regions where 
gender-based health disparities are highest. 
Examples might be launching a grant or award 
programme geared towards reducing rates of 
respiratory illnesses in areas where there is a  
high percentage of women smokers, or towards  
a technology-based solution for women in 
vulnerable populations to access transportation  
to healthcare services.

Private-sector stakeholders could help develop 
new financial products and investment vehicles, 
such as gender-lens investing, to attract capital 
towards projects that directly address the 
women’s health gap. Governments could  
further promote private-sector investments  
by creating tax incentive programmes for  
angel investors and venture capitalists that  
invest in women’s health.127

With collaboration, stakeholders have the potential 
to encourage investments and inspire the 
development of innovative financing models  
in women’s health.

Establish business policies that support 
women’s health

As previously outlined, healthcare disparities also 
lead to economic losses due to absenteeism, 
presenteeism and reduced productivity overall. 
Employers could consider how their workplace 
policies and benefits support women’s health, 
examine ways to better involve women in decision-
making processes, provide health and wellness 
benefits that support women’s health and create 
safe working environments in which women can 

32

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and Economiesspeak openly about their health needs. By better 
understanding employee demographics, employers 
could invest in the areas with higher impact and 
potential (for example, if a workforce includes 
women between 45 and 55 years old, flexible 
work policies that recognize menopause could 
help many employees). Given the fact that women 
are more than twice as likely as men to have 
depressive symptoms in their lifetime,128 employers 
may explore how mental-health programmes can 
help employees find evidence-based mental health 
resources that meet their needs.

McKinsey research has found a “broken rung” 
in women’s advancement throughout industries: 
for every 100 men promoted from entry-level to 
manager roles, 87 women are promoted and only 
73 women of colour are promoted.129 Overall, due 
to gender disparities in early promotions, men 
end up with 60% of manager-level positions in a 
typical company. More women in senior leadership 
positions may be able to advocate for policies 
that support women’s health, and companies 
may ultimately benefit from a healthier and more 
productive workforce. 

Often, leaders create change in the workplace 
based on their own experiences, knowledge or 
vision. If the decision-makers are predominantly 
men, the workplace tends to benefit men. Previous 

Data-driven, scalable actions to improve women’s 
health may vary widely, but the critical component 
is to determine how each stakeholder can

Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and EconomiesConclusion
There is a moral imperative to address the 
women’s health gap and improve the lives and 
livelihoods of billions of women worldwide. 

If health equity efforts sit within a tree of principles, 
they can be watered by research, flourish in the 
sun of business investments and grow far-reaching 
branches that stretch into the economy.

Achieving health equity is a collaborative and 
ongoing endeavour that relies on the active 
participation of governments, healthcare institutions, 
non-governmental organizations, individuals and 
all stakeholders vested in this cause. Tackling the 
women’s health gap depends on addressing  
the interconnected factors outlined in this  
report: the deficit in women-specific knowledge  
in science, the glaring data gaps, the disparities  
in healthcare delivery and the insufficient investment 
in women’s health.

Recognizing the vast potential to improve the lives 
and livelihoods of half the global population while 
boosting the economy serves as the catalyst for 
closing the women’s health gap. Every facet of 

this gap, from limited education to suboptimal 
treatments, offers an opportunity for transformation 
with the active involvement of governments, 
life science innovators, educational institutions, 
philanthropists, activists and more.

In this endeavour, there lies an opportunity of $1 
trillion in economic potential driven by improved 
women’s health and economic participation. The 
question is not whether this wealth of opportunities 
exists but rather who will take the initiative to seize it 
and drive change.

Women’s health is not a standalone issue – it is a 
cornerstone of societal well-being and progress. 
Better health and well-being for women creates a 
ripple effect that extends to families, communities 
and nations. This holistic approach, supported by 
collective action and sustained investment, will not 
only narrow the health gap but also contribute to 
the betterment of a shared global future.

In order to identify the incremental or net steady-state cost of each intervention, analysts identified the cost per DALY 
averted from the scientific literature (primarily WHO, DCP-3 and the Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry) for each 
intervention and income archetype and converted to standardized US dollars. To calculate the total cost for each country, 
the unit cost (cost per DALY averted) was multiplied by the volume of DALYs averted by that particular intervention in 
2040. Further discussion of the strengths and limitations of this approach are provided in the technical appendix.
