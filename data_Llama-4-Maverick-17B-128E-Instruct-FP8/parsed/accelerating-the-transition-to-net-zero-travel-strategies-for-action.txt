Executive Summary

The  worsening  effects  of  climate  change  have  made 

pathways over time. Companies can use the framework 

decarbonization a top priority for many industries, including 

as a tool to validate climate-related targets and time their 

global travel and tourism, which accounts for between 8 
and 11 percent of the world’s emissions.1 If nothing is done, 
carbon emissions will only rise as the sector grows. Travel 
activity is expected to soar by 85 percent from 2016 to 2030.2 

decarbonization initiatives. By assessing the feasibility and 

tradeoffs between multiple potential paths, companies could 

be better equipped to select the most appropriate pathway 

for them to reach their net-zero goals.

As  many  consider  reducing  their  travel,  consumers, 

employees, regulators, and investors are also ramping up 
the pressure for the sector to reduce its carbon emissions. 
In response, more travel companies have pledged to reach 

net-zero.  But  obstacles  stand  in  the  way.  The  range  of 

decarbonization technologies in the market is limited, and 

what’s available is expensive. 

While demand reduction may need to be part of the answer, 

there are many practical steps travel companies can take right 

now to accelerate their journey toward greater sustainability—

and potentially create value while doing so. In this report, 

McKinsey & Company and Skift Research explore four high-

priority areas for travel companies to focus their decarbonization 

efforts to catalyze the most meaningful outcomes for the 

environment, their customers, and themselves. 

1. Identify and Sequence Decarbonization 
Initiatives

Being familiar with the relevant decarbonization levers for 

your business is a good start, but it’s not enough. Many travel 

companies struggle with implementation and balancing tradeoffs. 

A robust plan factoring in various potential pathways is critical for 

success in a quest as complex as deep decarbonization.

The  marginal  abatement  cost  curve  (MACC)  pathway 

framework provides a cost-benefit analysis of the individual 

levers  and  phasing  plans,  helping  companies  identify 
strategic  tradeoffs  between  the  various  implementation 

2. Partner to Accelerate Decarbonization 
of Business Travel

Business travel represents 30 percent of all travel spend, 
making it an important segment for travel companies.3 As 
more organizations—businesses and non-profits alike—set 

more ambitious emissions-reduction goals for themselves, 

they’ll almost certainly be reevaluating their travel habits. This 

opens up opportunities for travel companies to enter into robust 

decarbonization partnerships with their corporate clients. 

The top 100 highest-spending organizations of business 

air travel spent around $12 billion on US booked domestic 

and international bookings in 2019. Forty-five organizations 

accounting for around half of this business air travel spend 

have not only made public decarbonization commitments, 
but have committed to a target year of 2030 or before.4 These 
organizations will likely be eager to seek out ways to reduce 

their emissions and could be more receptive to enter into 

decarbonization agreements with travel companies. 

To help organizations that travel achieve their net-zero goals, 

travel companies could expand their range of sustainability-

focused product and service offerings. As examples, car 

rental companies could encourage clients to pay for electric 

vehicles, while hotels may command a premium for corporate 

packages that promote low-carbon and sustainable practices. 

Travel companies could also devise other ways to support 
these  organizations  in  their  transition  toward  greater

3. Close the "Say-Do" Gap Among Leisure 
Travelers

4. Build New Sustainable Travel 
Businesses for the Future 

Instead of reacting to the latest developments in the transition 

toward net zero, the travel sector can be a proactive force and 

pioneer sustainable products and services. Not only will doing 

so reduce the industry’s carbon emissions, but it will also enable 

Studies  suggest  that  leisure  travelers—who  generate 

individual travel companies to create new sources of revenue 

70 percent of all travel revenues—are also supportive of 
decarbonization.5 A recent McKinsey survey indicates that 40 
percent of travelers globally say they are willing to pay at least 
two percent more for carbon-neutral flight tickets.6

There are as many possibilities as there are types of travel company. 
For example, an airline may consider playing a more active role 

in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) value chain, perhaps by 

However, Skift’s latest consumer survey has exposed a “say-

A Checklist for Action
The report concludes by offering a checklist for travel companies 

to track their readiness in each of the four strategies and to 

maximize their chances for a successful—and profitable—journey 

to net zero. Companies that act now could gain a competitive 
advantage over their peers, while those that stand by and wait

Accelerating the Transition to Net-Zero Travel: STRATEGIES FOR ACTIONSKIFT RESEARCH + MCKINSEY & COMPANYTerminology and Key Concepts

Note:  Numerous  criteria  are  critical  to 
sustainability, including water, waste, nature 
conservation, and emissions. This report 
focuses  only  on  the  carbon-emissions 
component of environmental sustainability, 
given  the  large  and  growing  volume  of 
corporate commitments to net zero and the 
challenges that companies currently face in 
mapping a decarbonization pathway. This 
approach enables the report to delve deeper 
and more richly into this critical topic. 

For a common understanding of the terms 
relating to carbon emissions, some of the 
key terms used in this report are described.

Carbon budget is the cumulative amount 
of carbon emissions permitted, as defined 
by academic institutions (e.g., IPCC), within 
a time period (e.g., through 2050) to remain 
within defined temperature-rise thresholds.

Carbon  intensity  is  the  volume  of 
emissions relative to a metric of physical 
or economic activity that’s reflective of an 
industry, for example, kilogram of CO2e per 
passenger kilometer. 

Carbon neutrality is the balance between 
a  company ’s  emissions  footprint  and 
voluntary compensation (offsetting) with 
avoidance carbon offsets to achieve an 
emission equilibrium. Carbon neutrality could 
refer to emissions in scopes 1 and 2, but not 
necessarily in scope 3 depending on the 
company’s disclosure and offsetting strategy.

Carbon  offsets  involve  investing  in 
activities  that  avoid  carbon  emissions, 
which is represented by a carbon credit 
that  can  be  traded  on  the  voluntary  or 
regulatory carbon markets. This offsets the 
carbon emissions elsewhere: in a different 
company, sector, or even country. Offsetting 
strategies  should  align  with  the  Oxford 
Principles  and  ensure  that  credits  are 
certified by third parties. In best practices, 
offsetting should be pursued as part of a 
holistic carbon mitigation strategy after or 
in parallel with carbon reductions.

Carbon reduction is direct reduction of a 
company’s emissions footprint over time. In 
mitigation hierarchies, reduction is the first 
action companies should take in relation to 
carbon emissions. Science Based Targets 
initiative  (SBTi)  requires  companies  to 
enact carbon reductions prior to any offsets 
or removals “counting” towards climate-
action strategies.

Carbon  removals  physically  remove 
carbon from the atmosphere and store in 
via various methods, for example, via direct 
air capture and storage (DAC) or bioenergy 
carbon  capture  and  storage  (BECCs). 
Similar to carbon offsets, carbon removals 
in best practice should be pursued as part 
of a holistic carbon mitigation strategy and 
in parallel with carbon reductions. 

Decarbonization  is  the  reduction  of  all 
GHG emissions, including CO2. 

Greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  are  gases 
that trap heat in the atmosphere, with key 
contributors  including  Carbon  Dioxide 
(CO2),  Methane  (CH4),  Nitrous  Oxide 
(N2O), and fluorinated gases. Reducing 
GHGs could limit global warming to a level 
that would prevent dangerous interferences 
with  the  climate  system.  For  a  single, 
comparable value for GHG emissions, the 
total emissions of all emitted gasses can be 
converted to CO2-equivalent (CO2e).

The  Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol is  a 
partnership between the World Resources 
Institute  (WRI)  and  the  World  Business 
Council  for  Sustainable  Development 
(WBCSD). It provides standards, guidance, 
tools,  and  training  for  business  and 
government  to  measure  and  manage 
climate-warming emissions. GHG Protocol 
categorizes  GHG  emissions  into  three 
scopes:

• 

Scope 1 covers direct emissions from 
controlled business operations such as 
fuel combustion, operation of vehicles, 
and fugitive emissions. 

6

• 

•  Scope  2  covers  indirect  emissions 
resulting  from  the  generation  of 
purchased  electricity,  steam,  and 
heating and cooling consumed by a 
company. 
Scope  3  includes  all  other  indirect 
emissions that occur in a company’s 
value chain such as purchased goods 
and services, business travel, waste 
disposal, investments, leased assets, 
and franchise activities. Calculating 
scope 3 emissions is more challenging 
than calculating scopes 1 and 2, and 
data  are  usually  of  a  lower  quality 
than scopes 1 and 2 due to challenges 
in gathering input from value-chain 
partners.  

Net-zero  emissions  is  a  step  beyond 
carbon neutrality, as the term applies to 
the full scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. In best 
practice,  net  zero  (as  defined  by  SBTi) 
involves the maximum feasible reduction 
of emissions (90 percent physical absolute 
reduction across all scopes by 2050 at the 
latest for cross-sector pathway), with goals 
aligned to a 1.5°C science-based target. 
It also includes the removal of remaining 
GHGs  with  carbon  removals.  Although 
offsetting  can  play  a  subsidiary  role,  it 
should be complementary to real reduction.

The  Science  Based  Targets  initiative 

(SBTi) defines and promotes best practices 
in  reducing  emissions  and  setting  net-
zero targets in line with climate science. 
SBTi  is  the  leading  organization  that 
provides clearly defined cross-sector and 
sector-specific (e.g., for aviation and road 
transport) guidance. The SBTi notes that 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change warned that global warming must 
not exceed 1.5°C to avoid the catastrophic 
impacts of climate change. To achieve this, 
cross-sector GHG emissions must halve by 
2030, and drop to net zero by 2050.

Sustainability: Travel’s 
New Frontier

Global warming is visibly affecting lives and industries 

across  the  globe.  Extreme  temperatures  are  rapidly 

becoming the norm across most regions, and July 2022 

was the sixth warmest July since global record keeping 
began in 1880.1 While virtually all industries both contribute 
to the problem of climate change and are impacted by it, 

the travel and tourism sector is arguably unique. It not only 

accounts for a large and growing share of greenhouse gas 

(GHG) emissions—between 8 to 11 percent of global GHG 
emissions in 20192—but is one of the most difficult sectors 
to  decarbonize  given  the  scale  and  variety  of  change 

required. However, there is a pathway to net zero, and 

committing to it should be a top priority to avoid the worst 

climate outcomes.

Doing More to Achieve Net Zero by 2050
There’s no shortage of companies pledging to fight global 

warming. Globally, more than 3,500 organizations across 

all industries have set emission-reduction targets, including 

airlines, hotels, restaurants, and those providing leisure and 
tourism services.1 Yet many travel and tourism companies 
commit to reach net zero without a plan in place to reduce 

88

emissions. As a result, sub-sectors have varying levels of 

maturity when it comes to the amount of decarbonization 

they  have  achieved  and  the  governance  around  their 

sustainability efforts, resulting in varying preparedness to 

reach net zero (Exhibit 3).

External  stakeholders  may  increasingly  require  full 

transition plans from companies, including the expected 

physical reductions they’ll commit to. A focus on reducing 

a company’s actual emissions (physical mitigation), rather 

than relying on removal credits, may also become the norm 

8    “Companies taking action,” Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) web-
site, accessed September 2022.

given the focus on physical reduction in the prioritization of 

carbon mitigation hierarchies, and supply constraints and 

market immaturity for carbon removals that make it difficult 

to source large volumes.

Setting  and  committing  to  sustainability  targets  may 

also  be  a  path  to  growth  when  a  company  is  able  to 

link  decarbonization  to  its  customer-value  proposition. 

“[The]  environmental  performance  really  is  probably 

the  defining  differential  there,”  said  Intrepid  Travel  co-

founder  and  chairman  Darrell  Wade.  “I  look  at  Intrepid 

and other companies who have taken a leading stance on 

sustainability, and we tend to be growing faster and be more 

profitable.”

Four Strategies to Accelerate 
Decarbonization
This report offers four practical, actionable strategies travel

and tourism companies can employ to define and prioritize 

Group’s VP of global social impact and sustainability, Aditi 

decarbonization initiatives:

Mohapatra, “from the need to drive change across highly 

diverse  actors  globally—from  multi-national  brands  to 

many small businesses and local entrepreneurs—to a lack 

of market-ready, zero-carbon technologies for certain key 

sectors like aviation, to traveler confusion around what 

‘sustainability’ really means.”

Yet reaching net-zero by 2050 is becoming a top priority—

driven  by  stakeholder  pressure—and  there  are  paths 

to achieve that goal. And while the ideal scenario has 

the  entire  travel  and  tourism  sector  progressing  in  its 

decarbonization efforts at the same pace, those acting 

sooner are likely to gain a competitive advantage over their 

peers (see “Sustainability is a stakeholder priority”).

That’s because if companies are not prepared to act on 

sustainable actions—or if the 1.5ºC budget is breached—

they may be viewed as higher-risk investments. External 

stakeholders may place intense pressure on companies, 

as  we  have  seen  in  other  sectors,  with  those  seen  as 

decarbonization risks treated similarly to those with poor 

credit ratings today. In general, the perspective on risk is 

shifting from purely financial to a focus on operations and 

long-term sustainability.

1.  Identify and sequence decarbonization initiatives

2. Partner to accelerate decarbonization of business travel

3. Close the “say-do” gap among leisure travelers

4. Build new sustainable travel businesses for the future 

Each strategy could be pursued separately or in parallel, 

depending on a company’s goals, circumstances, resources, 

and  capabilities.  However,  the  first  strategy—which 

incorporates the marginal abatement cost curve pathways 

framework—could become part of a company’s planning 

processes to ensure its own operations are decarbonized as 

a priority, and become an enabler for the other strategies. 

Strategies 2 and 3 may help support decarbonization costs 

by  engaging  organizations  or  individuals  that  spend  on 

travel in innovative partnerships or encouraging them to 

pick more sustainable options.

Strategy 4 opens new business-building opportunities for 

companies  to  explore  in  a  net-zero  world,  helping  them 

to  either  decommission  portions  of  the  core  businesses 

that are hard to abate (for example, by exiting short-haul 
flight routes in favor of electric buses), or expand into new 
revenue-driving sectors (for instance, through partnering 

with charging infrastructure players to better enable rental 

car customers to charge on the go).

Companies  can  gauge  whether  they’re  on  track  with  a 

starting-point action checklist for each strategy, provided at 

the end of the report.

SUSTAINABILITY IS STAKEHOLDER PRIORITY

Companies are likely to face pressure to act from customers, 

banned short-haul flights which had train or bus alternatives,

employees, regulators and government entities, and investors.

Customers  are  focusing  on  emissions  when  making 
travel decisions. For instance, 48 percent of the top 50 US 

organizational travel spenders have set, or committed to 
set, science-based targets.1 Leisure travelers are following. 
McKinsey’s consumer sentiment survey spanning 5,500 

travelers in 13 countries found emissions are now the top 
concern of respondents in 11 of the 13 countries polled. More 
than half the respondents were “really worried” about climate 

change and aviation should become carbon neutral in the 

future, while 36 percent plan to fly less to reduce their climate 
impact.2

Employees are increasingly conscious of environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) topics. Sustainability is high 

on the list of employee priorities—a Unily census shows 65 

percent are more likely to work for a company with a strong 
environmental policy.3 Sustainability matters. Morale and 
employee loyalty were 55 percent and 38 percent higher 

respectively  in  companies  with  strong  environmental 
programs compared to those without.4

Regulators and government  entities  are  also  focusing 
keenly on sustainability policies. The EU has lifted its 2030

be invested in given the limited resources available? Should 

a company prioritize options that are most impactful on the 

carbon baseline? Or should it adopt those that are highly 

visible to external stakeholders?

To  truly  impact  decarbonization,  companies  need  to 

ensure limited resources of capital and talent are allocated 

effectively through a robust planning process. Utilizing the 

marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) pathway framework 

can help, and this section addresses three core challenges 

travel  companies  face  when  planning  decarbonization 

journeys: 

1.  Understanding the costs and abatement potential of 

initiatives in different pathways

2. Determining the optimal sequencing of initiatives based 

on cost and abatement

3. Analyzing strategic tradeoffs of different implementation 

pathways

We’ll use a hospitality industry example to illustrate the 

process, as this sub-sector faces unique challenges around 

decarbonization because of the large volume of businesses 

that produce scope 3 emissions, or emissions resulting from 
activities not within a company’s direct control. “Our business 

model means we franchise or manage 99 percent of the hotels 

Reducing Emissions: A Hospitality Example
There  are  numerous  potential  routes  to  net  zero  that  a 

company  can  take.  A  pathway,  or  scenario,  is  a  single, 

hypothetical route that a company could take to implement 

initiatives and can result in differing cost and abatement 

profiles.  A  pathway  can  be  explored  via  the  MACC 

framework to understand the costs and abatement potential 

it would offer, as well as the strategic tradeoffs of differing 

implantation scenarios (see “How to read a MACC chart”).

Understanding the Costs and Abatement 
Potential of Initiatives in Different 
Pathways
Developing a decarbonization plan is an iterative process 

grounded in the sizing of initiatives. A pragmatic approach 

could be to explore two or three potential implementation 

routes to get to net zero which can be refined over time. This 

analysis could form the basis for strategic discussions on the 

cost-benefit tradeoffs for each pathway (Exhibit 7).

Analyzing  cost  and  emissions  abatement  in  different 

pathways enables the hotel to assess the strategic tradeoffs. 

For  example,  an  initiative  in  pathway  A  may  be  more 

expensive, but enables the offering of a “green” property to 

business travelers at a higher rate. Alternatively, an initiative 

in pathway B could be less expensive cumulatively, but result 

in higher unabated emissions which could lead to negative 

investor sentiment or regulatory implications. Regardless 

of the decision, analyzing pathways in this way enables the 

hotel leadership team to assess the cost-benefit tradeoffs of 

the decision more clearly. 

Determining the Optimal Sequencing of 
Initiatives Based on Cost and Abatement
In addition to sizing individual initiatives, travel companies 

can consider the effect of sequencing their initiatives on 

decarbonization planning. The order in which initiatives are 

implemented may affect cost and abatement profiles. For 

hotels, a key decision may be whether to retrofit deep building 

infrastructure before or after electrification efforts (such as 

introducing Internet of Things-based systems to manage 

heating, ventilation, and air conditioning). For instance, while it 

may cost more upfront to undertake a deep retrofit at the same 

time as building electrification, it could result in greater savings 

from a lifetime cost perspective.

STRATEGY 2: 
Partner to Accelerate Decarbonization 
of Business Travel

Business travel is a crucial revenue stream for the travel industry—and a major source of GHG emissions. 
Travel companies can partner with organizations to accelerate both of their decarbonization journeys.

Business travel accounted for $334.2 billion in US-booked 

spend. 45 organizations have publicly set a target on or before 

domestic and international travel spending in 2019, or 30 
percent of total spending.1 While the COVID-19 pandemic 
dramatically reduced volumes, it also highlighted business

2030, which represents 50 percent of spend. This means travel 

companies can likely expect greater engagement around 

sustainability in the years ahead as organizations pursue

passengers, they can drive up to 75 percent of airline earnings 

due to their greater willingness to purchase higher class 
or refundable fares.2 Similarly, many hotels rely on business 
travelers to book rack rates, and hotels near convention centers, 

for example, rely on business travelers to drive up occupancy. 

Yet business travel is emission heavy—in Europe, business 

travelers are responsible for 30 percent of emissions from 
travel.3 In absolute terms, business travel spending in the 
United States is second only to China, and many organizations

Achieving these commitments will be extremely challenging, 
especially as most of these organizations are expected to 

grow. Unless there’s a conscious effort to reduce travel per 

employee, that growth will likely increase both the number of 

employees and the amount of travel, working against efforts to 

decarbonize.

In a post-COVID world, emissions from business travel per 

employee can be reduced, but organizations will need help 

from travel companies to do so. If more sustainable options are 
not available, organizations may reduce overall business travel 

per employee by substituting travel with hybrid or remote work 

technology or choosing less carbon-intensive travel service 

providers (Exhibit 11).

STRATEGY 3: 
Close the “Say-do” Gap Among Leisure 
Travelers

Leisure travel accounted for about 70 percent of the $1.13 trillion spent on US-booked domestic and 
international travel in 2019.1 While a majority of these travelers say they want to travel more sustainably, 
they need encouragement to actually do so.

Yet despite this growing interest in sustainable travel services 

and products, most travelers have not paid a premium for a 

more sustainable option. A Skift survey of 1,011 respondents 

for this report found only 14 percent of travelers have willingly 
paid more for such an option,1  suggesting a large gap between 
what leisure travelers say they want to do and their actions. 

2020

This substantial “say-do” gap could hinder the sustainable 

travel transition: for example, a 2022 Swiss study found when 

presented with the option to buy carbon offsets for flights, only 

around 5 percent of consumers did so—resulting in a mean 
2121
carbon offset purchase of only around €1 per flight.2

There are multiple root causes behind this “say-do” gap. While 

travel companies can’t fix it alone, they can take bold moves to 

shape future industry standards and help travelers overcome 

barriers to acting (and many booking platforms have begun to 

do so). For instance, research on travelers’ willingness to pay for 

sustainability provides insights on some clear social, environmental, 

and physical barriers to reducing carbon emissions when traveling. 

Additionally, the field of behavioral science sheds light on barriers 
that may prevent consumers from taking action.3

Three  Considerations  for Travel 
Companies When  Encouraging 
Sustainable Purchases 
Travel companies can offer opportunities to book or purchase 

information using a consistent method for measurement 

of  impact  and  present  it  in  a  way  that  does  not  deter 

travel demand. “One of the biggest hurdles in promoting 

sustainable travel is developing a consistent approach to 

sustainable travel services or products, provide information, 

measuring the environmental impact of someone’s travel 

and use behavioral science techniques such as nudging to 

choices,” said Google vice-president of travel Richard Holden. 

encourage leisure travelers to make sustainable purchase 

“Our hypothesis is that people need to trust the information 

decisions in line with what they say they want to purchase. 

they’re seeing before they take action, and consistency 

Specific ideas include:

across platforms is part of how we build that trust.” 

Travel  companies  could  build  trust  with  consumers  by 

adhering  to  and  presenting  industry  standards  (see 

“Advancing sustainability through industry standards”), and 

by providing transparency on price, emissions, and costs. For 

example, apparel company Everlane breaks down the cost 

of goods to show the premium included for fair labor and 

sustainable supply practices. The founder of G Adventures, 

Bruce Poon Tip, said its goal in providing transparency was 

putting a "program in place that involves our customers in the 

whole process, so they understand what we're doing and how 

they're involved in it and make it part of the customer journey."

Today booking journeys lack options 
and information for consumers booking 
in the US

Current State of most 
travel booking journeys

Target State to nudge 
decarbonized decisions

1.  Clearly provide options for less carbon intense 
travel services or products within the booking 
journey

Companies  can  more  clearly  provide  options  for  less 

carbon  intensive  travel  and  offset  purchase  within  the 

booking journey, providing transparency that demystifies 

their emissions impact and creates trust with travelers.

The pricing structure of these sustainable travel products 

and  services  need  to  be  appealing  to  consumers,  while 

commercially viable. One way of achieving this is by offering 

variable pricing based on a traveler’s stated preferences so 

they decide how much to pay. Another option is offering 

a  one-time  fee  for  ongoing  decarbonization,  knowing 

consumers are more likely to pay a one-time fee than a small 

amount each time they purchase a sustainable product. 

For  ground  transportation,  providing  more  sustainable 

options could mean offering EV vehicles for rent or hire, like 

Uber Green and Lime scooters. For hotels and lodging, it 

may range from sourcing and sharing more low-emissions or 

even net-zero hospitality options to creating and marketing 

sustainability  membership  programs  that  provide  the 

identification of and discounts to sustainable travel options. 

Airlines could provide the option to offset emissions from 

their flight—for example, through reforestation or general 

carbon offsets, or via a donation to community projects. 

Some airlines, such as KLM, allow travelers to combine SAF 

and offsets, while others such as Ryanair offer offsets alone. 

2.  Contextualize and inform on carbon footprint and 

emissions 

We reviewed 40 travel company booking journeys in the 
US and just four provided carbon-emissions context and 

information. This may be because it can be difficult to provide 

Accelerating the Transition to Net-Zero Travel: STRATEGIES FOR ACTIONSKIFT RESEARCH + MCKINSEY & COMPANYTo dispel the idea that the decisions of individual travelers 

can’t have a positive impact, companies could communicate 

the tradeoffs of purchasing decisions. They could explain 

the differences between types of carbon emissions, their 

consequences, and the real-world impact that reducing 

them could have. Sharing the positive impact consumers 

can have on climate change may also motivate them to make 

sustainable choices. 

One way to put this strategy into practice, for instance, is 

by clearly displaying options in a revamped online booking 

journey. This can lead consumers to choose less carbon-

intensive travel options (Exhibit 16).

Online  travel  agencies  have  made  strides  in  providing 

sustainable options and informing consumers and, while it’s too 

early to measure the impact of these initiatives, the preliminary 

results are promising. For example, Skyscanner, which displays 

the CO2 emissions of flights with Travalyst, had roughly 10 

million travelers choose lower-emission flights in 2019. This grew 
2828
by 58 million in two years and is forecast to double annually.1 

3.  Prompt consumers through behavioral science
Aligning consumers’ travel choices with their ambitions—

helping them do what they say they want to do—could be 

helped by the use of nudge theory to break down behavioral 

barriers. For instance, what if sustainable travel choices 

and destinations were not only prominently marketed, but 

less sustainable options were actively demoted in terms of 

visibility? What if carbon offsetting was the default option, 

rather than something travelers must opt into? What if carbon 

emissions  associated  with  different  choices  were  more 

clearly displayed, something Bookdifferent.com does next to 

price of booking options? 

Companies may also incentivize consumers with direct and 

immediate benefits, such as social recognition and loyalty perks. 

They could offer sustainably branded products consumers 

can use to virtue signal, and develop loyalty program perks 

that reward decarbonizing choices. Companies could also 

recommend membership programs where benefits scale as 

customers make choices that lead to decarbonization.

ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY 
THROUGH INDUSTRY 
STANDARDS

Common  industry  accounting  standards  for 

environmental  metrics  not  only  help  generate 

consumer support. They also assist travel companies 

in  identifying  and  acting  on  emission-reduction 

levers,  as  well  as  working  with  corporations  to 

achieve their sustainability goals. 

Yet the carbon accounting standard landscape today 

can be fragmented and unclear. Even though the 

vast majority of companies use the GHG Protocol 

to calculate carbon inventories, there can be lack 

of clarity on required primary data quality, where 

companies should source emissions factors to ensure 

like-for-like comparisons, and what lifecycle stages 

to include. Companies are faced with tough choices 

on what calculation methodologies to use, creating 

confusion across the industry—and for customers 

trying to discern what’s truly a sustainable choice. 

The potential impact collaboration could bring to the 

travel sector is highlighted by industry associations 

such  as  the  WBCSD  Pathfinder  Initiative1, 

which  seeks  to  support  greater  emissions  data 

transparency for scope 3 emissions, and IATA CO2 

Connect2, which aims to harmonize aviation sector 
emissions reporting. Common, like-for-like reporting 

supports both the travel sector’s decarbonization 

goals and customers’ desire for more information.

2021.

2    “IATA CO2 Connect,” IATA.

Applying  these  insights  to  travel  program  design  and 

marketing techniques could alter consumers’ decisions to be 

more sustainable, something the public sector has deployed 

with great success in transportation. In Japan, for example, 

companies shared information about carbon emissions and 

health effects to heighten the focus on the negative impact of 

some travel methods. They also offered goal-setting techniques 

to help commuters follow through on their sustainable-travel 

intentions and provided personalized information (occasionally 

based on multi-day travel diaries) on travel planning. The result? 
Carbon emissions fell by 19 percent.2 
2929

To make these booking journey changes while maintaining a 
great customer booking experience, travel companies will need 

to use a methodical approach. A dedicated task force armed 

with digital, consumer insights, and sustainability expertise 

can work across the organization to understand and develop 

specific changes. The cross-functional team can test and refine 

potential changes with smaller sample groups in each segment 

before broad implementation to ensure a smooth customer 

booking journey.

The significant challenge of transitioning to net zero also presents an opportunity for companies to build resilience, 
future-proof their businesses, and generate new revenue streams by developing green products and services.

New-business building offers a chance to launch a portfolio 

HOSPITALITY AND ACCOMMODATION

of new potential sources of green revenue. Companies can 

make the most of core assets and capabilities to create new 

products, services, or business models. Future offerings are 

still hard to envision as the net-zero transition accelerates, 

but there are already several emerging that companies may 

explore building themselves or partnering to develop:

AVIATION 

 Ď Airlines  could  take  an  active  part  in  the  sustainable 
aviation fuel (SAF) or novel propulsion value chain by 

directly supporting the scaling of production facilities and 

technologies with producers. For example, they could co-

invest with guaranteed offtake volumes of SAF at defined 
rates or with pre-orders for new zero-emission aircraft 

programs. “If you can scale [SAF] up, drive economies 

to scale and build a real industry, that's how you make 

it economic and competitive,” said United Airlines CEO 

Scott Kirby. “Our goal is to invest—not assuming that the 

prices are going to be at this price forever, but assuming 

that we can drive economies to scale and get the price 

 Ď The  hospitality  sector  could  transition  to  new  and 
partnership-based design to provide green offerings and 

decarbonize construction. “We are transition[ing] to smart 

green hotels utilizing new technology, eco-design, and 

innovative partnerships,” said Accor chief sustainability 

officer  Brune  Poirson.  ”[Accor  is]  expanding  the  use 

of design standards, performance tools, and the latest 

green technologies for new hotels while supporting the 

transition of the existing hotel network to low-carbon 

infrastructure with green finance options.”

 Ď Similarly, the CEO of Indonesian hospitality and lifestyle 
brand  Potato  Head,  Ronald  Akili,  said  cross-sector 

collaboration in low-carbon construction was critical: 

“We want to lead the way in low-carbon constructional 

hospitality through using recycled materials and low 

embodied energy materials like recycled aggregates in 

concrete and low-carbon steel and interior furnishings.”.

 Ď Hotels could also invest in IoT and other decarbonization 
capabilities and partnerships to better manage building 

down and make it economic to eventually be competitive 

energy usage and sequester carbon. For example, Hilton 

with fossil fuels.”

 Ď In developing an ecosystem to scale novel technologies, 
airlines could also partner with academic institutions. For 

example, Southwest Airlines has committed $10 million to 

Yale University's Center for Natural Carbon Capture and 

CEO Christopher J. Nassetta said its commitment to venture 

capital fund Fifth Wall’s Climate Tech Fund would “invest in 

software, hardware, renewable energy, energy storage, 

smart buildings and carbon sequestration technologies to 

decarbonize the $10.5 trillion real estate industry.” 

Yale’s School of the Environment for what CEO Bob Jordan 

said was “to fund research surrounding innovative natural 

 Ď Another potential hospitality route is the creation a “green 
certification”  standard  in  cooperation  with  industry 

solutions to mitigate net greenhouse gas emissions.”

 Ď Outside of sustainable fuels, airlines could also consider 
launching regional or commuter airlines with zero-emission 

alternative propulsion small aircraft (for example, electric or 

hydrogen powered) or creating commercial bus services 

in lieu of short-haul connections. For example, American 

Airlines created a short-haul bus partnership with Landline 

to provide travelers with connections to Pennsylvania’s 
smaller airports.1

or standard-setters and offer certification services to 

other hotel properties. WTTC director of sustainability 

Christopher Imbsen said it was “working on developing 

a  verification  system  [to  validate  hotel  properties  as 

sustainable] together with partners.”

BOOKING PLATFORMS AND DESTINATIONS

 Ď Booking platforms could specialize in green offerings or 
position themselves (or sub-brands) as sustainable travel 

specialists. Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel cited 

the Travel Sustainable Program and Sustainable Travel 

Badge on Booking.com. “This proprietary sustainability 
certification, with over 130,000 properties recognized today, 

Accelerating the Transition to Net-Zero Travel: STRATEGIES FOR ACTIONSKIFT RESEARCH + MCKINSEY & COMPANY32

[makes] it easier for customers to adopt a sustainable travel 

Across the value chain, loyalty and credit-card programs 

mindset,” Fogel said.

 Ď Destinations may also have a part to play. As Brad Dean, 
CEO of Discover Puerto Rico said: “The lack of reliable, 

relevant  benchmarking  tools  for  destinations,  which 

must encompass various industry verticals and many 

independent businesses and venues, presents a major 

challenge for destination leaders to measure and monitor 

performance in this area.” Destinations could collaborate 

to create relevant measurement tools and offer services 

to quantify environmental impact. Ecotourism could also 

benefit from a benchmark or rating, where travel platforms 
and hotels favor companies taking steps to minimize the 
environmental impact of their tours.

can offer customers a consolidated view of their emissions 

across travel providers, develop sustainable offerings along 

the travel customer journey, and reward customers for 

choosing sustainable options.

Launching  these  new  businesses  will  likely  require 

companies to launch special initiatives outside of their current 

core businesses. These teams will need to be empowered 

to experiment with and learn from short iterations and 

pilots without the pressure to be immediately profitable. 

Fortunately, the first examples of travel companies applying 

green business-building principles show promising results, 
which should pave the way for others to follow suit. We see 
successful green business builders use five steps to identify 

and plan green business-building opportunities (Exhibit 18).
