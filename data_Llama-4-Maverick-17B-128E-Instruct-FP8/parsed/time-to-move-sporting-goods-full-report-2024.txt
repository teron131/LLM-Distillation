Sporting 
Goods 2024: 
Time to move

Foreword

The title of this year’s report “Time to Move” 
reflects two priorities for sporting goods 
companies. First, to adapt to a challenging 
and continuously changing economic and 
business landscape, and second, to elevate 
physical activity globally to help people 
live more active, healthier lives – a goal 
shared by the sporting goods industry, the 
World Health Organization (WHO), and 
McKinsey. To underline its importance, we 
open this year’s report with a conversation 
between Emma Zwiebler, interim CEO of 
the World Federation of the Sporting Goods 
Industry (WFSGI), Dr. Fiona Bull, head of 
the physical activity unit at the WHO, and 
Alexander Thiel, a partner and co-lead 
on sporting goods work at McKinsey.

Sporting Goods 2024What is the scientific evidence that physical activity improves health span?
Fiona: The evidence on physical activity and its health benefits is substantial. We 
often turn to a landmark paper by Prof. Jerry Morris in The Lancet in 1953. It studied 
bus conductors and bus drivers. The bus conductors were running up and down the 
stairs selling tickets on the London buses, and the bus drivers were sitting all day. 
He showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the risk of heart 
disease. Subsequent studies over the following decades in various occupational 
groups with different physical activity profiles built a solid evidence base on the 
protective effect of being more active. The benefits of regular physical activity 
include a reduction of the risk of coronary heart disease and many site-specific 
cancers like breast cancer and colon cancer. It also reduces the risk of diabetes, 
hypertension, and strokes–these collectively are the leading causes of premature 
death, globally. What’s really exciting is that the latest evidence coming out from 
studies now using digital technologies, specifically wearables, is reinforcing these 
findings in also showing stronger protective effects between physical activity and 
physical and mental health outcomes. This is really good news.

Is there an overall mission of the industry to actually help people to move and 
live longer, better lives?
Emma: As an industry, we are passionate about sport, movement, and people 
being more active for two reasons. First and foremost, we endorse everything 
Fiona just outlined. We want to help people to stay healthy and live longer and play 
our part in a sustainable future. In a way, that is ‘why’ the sporting goods industry 
exists. The second element of why we are engaged in this topic is that we also 
have an economic interest in more people being active, exercising, and practicing 
sports. Our business is intrinsically linked to sport and physical activity, and 
therefore, to levels of sport and physical activity. The low levels of activity that we 
see today pose an existential threat to our industry if they don’t rise. And currently, 
the next generation is the least active in history. If we take the United States as 
an example, 32 percent of men and 48 percent of women are currently inactive by 
WHO standards. When you go to the next generation of 11-to-17-year-olds, these 
numbers rise to 64 percent of boys and 81 percent of girls. The same pattern is 
recreated across multiple key markets for the industry. In China, current levels of 
inactivity calculated by WHO are at 80 percent for boys and 89 percent for girls.

Alexander: Working with many people from the sporting goods industry for 
almost two decades, it is clear that all of them, from brand marketers to product 
developers to CEOs, strongly identify with the mission to help people be active 
and healthy. It is fantastic to see WFSGI and WHO signing a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) regarding this issue. In my view, this is only strengthened by 
the fact that there is also a strong business case for the industry to elevate physical 
activity levels.

When we look at the data regarding physical activity, where do we stand and 
what is the momentum?
Fiona: WHO collates global data using monitor data that comes from national data 
collection. Unfortunately, on average, the stats show we are only treading water. 
Globally, the current levels show 28 percent of adults are inactive to a degree that 
they are not meeting the global recommendations. There are, obviously, some 
countries that are making better progress by implementing programs, but this is 
counteracted by others that are worsening. When we look at why – that is, looking 
at what we call the drivers of inactivity – we see, in part, technology, changes in 

5

Sporting Goods 2024how we work, generally less physical work, and changes in recreation and leisure 
activities such as increased use of technological and phone-based alternatives.

Alexander: We also see in the data that there are still significant physical activity 
gaps in the populations of individual countries. Women, kids, ethnic minorities, and 
lower income brackets are generally physically less active. For example, recent 
research by the Aspen Institute in the United States showed that among children 
from families making less than $25,000 a year, participation in a healthy level of 
activity decreased to about 25 percent, while children from families with incomes 
above $100,000 have significantly higher physical activity participation rates of 
about 45 percent. These disparities are something we jointly cannot accept, since 
they have a direct correlation to life span.

What concretely can the industry do to help raise physical activity levels?
Fiona: The industry is critical to helping us achieve our goal of one billion more 
active, healthier people by 2030. First, the industry has a role to play in inspiring 
people to partake in an active lifestyle. Campaigns can have a big effect. An 
important aspect of that is how we present being active – in the images and 
language used – it must reach and resonate with those who are not already active. 
Also, if we wish to reach the people who are currently less active or even inactive, 
we have to really understand what will attract them to come back to a sport or 
active recreation, walk or cycle more often, and what will attract people to take up 
a new activity, particularly when you’re thinking of middle-aged and older adults. 
We are concerned about the decline in levels of physical activity in older adults in 
most countries, yet people are living longer and these years should be healthy and 
active. Of course, some of the barriers are economic, so industry has a big role to 
play in helping provide affordable and accessible products and services.

Alexander: The industry should approach physical activity with the same boldness, 
rigor, and determination with which it approaches decarbonization: setting bold 
targets, taking concrete steps, and measuring impact. Everything needs to start 
with a commitment and measurable objectives. What you don’t measure, you 
cannot manage. From there, concrete steps to elevate physical activity need to 
be followed, and there are many avenues: product design, distribution, marketing 
campaigns, partaking in sports ecosystems, or offering engaging services.

Emma: That is a good analogy. Physical inactivity could be seen as the “human 
climate change” and we all need to work together – industry, WHO, governments, 
municipalities, cities – to combat it. That is why WFSGI and WHO have signed a 
memorandum of understanding to collaborate closely and concretely on this topic. 
And we are thankful for the support of McKinsey in this endeavor.

WHO and WFSGI, with the help of McKinsey, will continue to support the sporting 
goods industry with data and guidance on elevating physical activity to drive 
implementation of the MOU and WHO’s Global Action Plan on Physical Activity. 
There is a clear call for action,vc  and we will support the industry to step up and 
answer it.

Sporting Goods 2024Executive Summary

Time to move: Sporting Goods 2024 
As the world continued its uneven progress in 2023, the sporting goods 
industry faced familiar challenges. Economic headwinds, persistent 
inflation, and regional conflicts undermined consumer confidence, while 
companies continued to struggle with inventories—mainly overstocking, 
as anticipated demand failed to materialize. But the industry again 
demonstrated its resilience. Revenue growth over the year was at  
6 percent, compared with 2 percent in 2022, amid stronger 
performance across geographies. 

As we look toward 2024, this report highlights a renewed sense of 
optimism among industry leaders. This reflects opportunities arising 
from an improving market environment and new consumer preferences. 
More people are choosing sports that are quicker to pick up, require 
less commitment, and are more social, rather than organized sports 
with fixed time commitments, requiring teams, or where high levels 
of skill are required. Participation as a driver has become equally as 
important as performance. And after supply demand imbalances in the 
recent period, companies are turning to integrated business planning 
and analytics to help them navigate more volatile times. Meanwhile, 
sporting ecosystems and the demands of sustainability offer potential 
for innovation. With these themes in mind, this year’s Sporting Goods 
report paints a picture of an industry at a pivotal moment, facing 
challenges but also opportunities to achieve sustained growth. 

Review of 2023 
The past year was one in which regional differences came to the fore. 
Companies in Western Europe posted growth of 8 percent, a strong 
rebound from the previous year’s 3 percent decline, while the industry 
in Asia Pacific saw income rising 11 percent, after a 4 percent decline in 
2022. North American companies followed 2022’s 6 percent growth 
with growth of 2 percent. Latin America, meanwhile, was the standout 
performer, with growth of 22 percent, after 20 percent growth the 
previous year.   

The industry’s super winners maintained their momentum in 2023, 
outperforming the market by focusing on attractive categories and 
employing smart go-to-market strategies to inspire and engage 
with consumers. These leaders exemplified the merits of a balanced 
portfolio, with retail innovation, trend-responsive branding, and cost-
effective manufacturing among pillars that supported growth. 

There were also notable variations in the competitive landscape. In 
China, for example, competition intensified, with global titans losing 
their edge to local players, which had a market share of about  
60 percent among the top 20 brands. In Latin America, conversely, 
global players continued to dominate, with a share of about 90 percent, 
amid a strong soccer and tennis focus. 

11

Sporting Goods 2024Outlook for 2024 
In the first chapter of this report – Mixed markets and polarized 
performance – we highlight an improving industry outlook, with 
about 90 percent of sporting goods leaders anticipating stability or 
improvements in sales and margins, according to McKinsey & WFSGI 
Sporting Goods Industry Report Survey 2023. Still, industry leaders 
are not universally optimistic, amid persistent concern over inflation 
and overstocking. Eighty one percent of respondents to this year’s 
survey say inflation and inventory levels/ cost of capital are a continuing 
challenge, and 50 percent worry about attracting talent and the 
pressing imperative to become more sustainable. In addition, economic 
headwinds may still apply. In China, for example, 2023 marked a 
recovery from a tough 2022, but many Chinese consumers will likely 
trade down in 2024 as tough economic conditions persist. 

In the remaining four chapters, we drill down into the key themes that 
will likely feature on executive agendas in the year ahead: 

1.  Shifting consumer preferences and generational opportunities  
Consumer confidence remains subdued, yet the sporting goods 
sector has shown it can be resilient, with many companies relatively 
immune to downtrading. That said, brand loyalty is declining. 
Consumer behaviors are also shifting, amid a move away from 
organized sports and toward more accessible options. This pivot 
presents new avenues to growth, particularly in segments such as 
pickleball/paddle tennis (+159 percent growth from 2019 to 2022) 
and off-course golf (+57 percent growth from 2019 to 2022), which 
have seen surges in popularity. 

In addition, there is a generational shift in progress, with some older 
demographics spending more time and money on their favourite 
sports and hobbies. However, demographic dynamics vary across 
regions, suggesting brands are tasked with crafting age-inclusive 
strategies to suit their constituencies.  

2.  Planning, planning, planning  

Inventory management remains a pressing challenge, as companies 
grapple with overstocking and demand volatility. The rising cost of 
capital further complicates the outlook, compelling companies to 
reevaluate their planning processes. The key to being prepared lies 
in integrated business planning, which can significantly improve 
coordination and reduce the number of surprises. Still, effective 
implementation requires new governance approaches and cross-
functional alignments, as well as standardized inputs and outputs. 
Companies can combine these with advanced analytics and AI/ML 
to generate more precise end-to-end planning and forecasting. 

3.  From sustainability targets to actions  

The sustainability journey is accelerating, supported by regulation 
and corporate action to set and meet sustainability targets. In China, 
the US, and EU, there is increasing government support for funding 
that will drive the energy transition. 

12

Sporting Goods 2024Many sporting goods brands, including smaller companies, are 
now stepping up, not only setting ambitious targets but also aiming 
to address social and governance issues in their operations and 
supply chains. These steps reflect rising consumer demand for more 
sustainable offerings. For example, consumers increasingly value 
products that use organic or sustainable input material—and are 
often willing to pay a premium for them.  

Still, while many companies are making progress, others are still 
in the starting blocks. Here, we outline ten impact areas along the 
value chain and specific initiatives in each to help companies move 
forward. These range from new business models to initiatives that 
may boost consumer awareness, each of which companies can 
assess through the lens of a cost abatement curve. 

4.  Playing the sports ecosystems game  

After some companies embraced direct-to-consumer business 
models, the past year has seen a renewed focus on wholesale 
partnerships, reflecting the understanding that consumers love to 
shop in multi-brand environments. Going a step further, increasing 
numbers of companies are embracing explicit ecosystem strategies, 
taking their thinking beyond channel coverage and product 
assortments. This reflects the fact that technological advancements 
and health trends are driving a shift in consumer demand from 
individual products to comprehensive health- and activity-centered 
solutions.  

Companies cannot meet all consumer needs alone. But they can 
through networks of companies that serve some element of the 
customer journey – from opportunity discovery, to planning and 
preparing, traveling, participation, and recovery. McKinsey research 
shows that the activities within these steps that customers value 
most include finding similarly minded people, shaping products to 
their specific needs, obtaining insurance to reduce risks, liaising 
with travel agencies, and receiving support during activities. 
Ecosystems enable companies to cater to these demands. 

This report identifies five levers for value generation in an ecosystem 
environment: new subscription revenues, lower customer acquisition 
costs, cross-selling, commissions, and operational efficiencies.  

The past year has marked a period of recalibration for the sporting 
goods industry, with uneven recoveries and persistent challenges. 
Looking ahead, we believe the most successful players will innovate to 
address shifting consumer demands, manage supply chain complexity, 
streamline operations, and seize opportunities in emerging markets  
and ecosystems. Through efforts in these areas, and a sharp focus  
on execution, the industry will be well placed to continue its  
positive trajectory.

Sporting goods companies 
expect business conditions to 
remain challenging in 2024, 
after a partial recovery in 2023. 
However, demand dynamics 
will likely vary across markets 
and segments, suggesting 
companies might need to 
tailor their strategies to local 
conditions.

In the face of a cost-of-living 
crunch, consumer confidence 
is under pressure. However, 
with different and often 
more social sports attracting 
attention, alongside rising older 
demographic participation, 
sporting goods companies have 
an opportunity to unlock new 
pockets of value.

Sky-high stock levels, a rising 
cost of capital, and surging 
promotions mean sporting 
goods companies need to 
think again about planning 
processes, data, and analytics. 
Through advanced approaches, 
they can create more tailored 
solutions and support faster, 
fact-based decision making. 

As the impacts of climate 
change intensify, sporting 
goods companies are ramping 
up their efforts to become more 
sustainable. Ten actions can 
help accelerate the journey, 
encourage customers, and 
boost performance.

Ecosystems plays offer sporting 
goods companies the chance 
to cut the cost of customer 
acquisition, boost lifetime 
value, and develop new revenue 
streams. But implementation 
requires careful planning  
and execution.

Michael Murray is the Chief Executive 
Officer at Frasers Group. In this 
capacity, he continues to accelerate the 
Group’s strategy to achieve its vision of 
building the planet’s most admired and 
compelling brand ecosystem.

Some of our readers might not 
necessarily know Frasers Group. 
What is Frasers Group and what does 
it do in sports?
Frasers Group, formerly Sports Direct, 
started in 1982 with one store. And for 
35 years, it was very much a simple 
but effective business model, based 
in the UK, and with a small presence 
in Europe. In 2017, we started our 
elevation strategy, which was a big 
change program aimed at taking Sports 
Direct from an entry level or first price 
point business into a good, better, and 
best business. The strategy was all 
about improving store environments, 
digital capabilities, merchandising, 
and consumer storytelling—ensuring 
we have a business that is fit for the 
future. In parallel, we completely 
diversified, creating three core pillars: 
Sport, Premium, and Luxury. We bought 
House of Fraser, which was a leading 
department store in the UK, and we 
bought FLANNELS, which was the 
number-one independent chain for 

luxury fashion. And the deep three 
main common themes were footwear, 
accessories, and clothing, with the 
world’s most aspirational global brands 
and a common back-end solution to 
power three different industries. That’s 
how Frasers Group was born. We obsess 
over brands, work with them, nurture 
them, and own them. And today, with 
over 1500 plus stores and 20 different 
countries, we’re on a mission to build the 
planet’s most admired and compelling 
brand ecosystem. 

What makes the sporting goods 
industry attractive as a business for 
a retailer?
Post-pandemic, the consumer is a lot 
more conscious and educated around 
fitness and, as a result, the demand for 
sports across the world is at an all-time 
high. It is also easier to get global scale 
in this growing industry, because there 
are only around ten globally consistent 
brands, whereas in other industries, there 
might be 20 or 30, constantly changing 
brands. I think that’s very attractive. 

What is your vision for the role that 
your group will play in the sporting 
goods industry in the coming years?
Our vision for sports is to serve our 
consumers with the best kit their 

money can buy. We obsess over key 
sport categories football, running, 
training, and have a new outdoor 
category concept launching in 2024, 
which provides the consumer with a 
winning proposition. Our good, better, 
and best price points mean we offer 
something for everyone, without 
alienating a more entry-level consumer. 

In the past, we have been very 
dominant in the UK and Ireland. And the 
first part of our strategy was to focus 
on protecting and building our home 
territory, leveraging that as a proof of 
concept. Now, the focus is on growing 
overseas, especially in mainland 
Europe. 

Our ambition in any market we enter is 
to be number one by size or positioning 
– we want to be the number one 
partner of choice for our strategic sport 
brand partners. So M&A is going to be 
key. Last year, for example, we bought 
the number-one sporting goods retailer 
in Denmark, Sportmaster. 

What is your perspective on the  
value that you as a retailer can bring 
to a brand?
First of all, we are big: scale is 
important because brands want to 
work with fewer bigger and better 

16

Sporting Goods 2024 
partners. They want to work with 
people who can give them one holistic 
plan that is fully aligned with their 
brand strategy. Second, we don’t 
pay dividends, but instead reinvest 
back into stores or infrastructure 
projects, such as automation, digital 
projects, and marketing—that’s how 
we strengthen our proposition. Third, 
we’ve got very aligned strategies with 
the brands, as we all want to elevate the 
marketplace. We are not a franchise 
business; we are either wholly owned or 
in a joint venture with all of our stores. 
So, our store estate is very consistent 
and we can work collaboratively with 
brands, with one overarching strategy, 
wherever we operate. 

Your group also owns brands, not 
just retailers. Where do you see the 
benefit of having both in a portfolio?
Owning some brands outright, like 
Everlast and Slazenger, is great for 
our business, as it gives consumers 
the choice to purchase products 
at good entry level prices while still 
allowing us to make a good margin. 
This is a unique selling point versus 
some of our competitors. In addition, 
we strategically invest in some brands, 
like Hugo Boss. This allows us to come 
together with management teams and 
act as a strategic accelerator.

In what ways do you follow an 
ecosystem strategy with these 
brands and partners?
Our ecosystem includes our Sport, 
Premium, and Luxury divisions, with our 
shared services being our warehouse, 
our accounts team, our real estate 
team, and digital capabilities. We’ve 
launched our own regulated, flexible 
payment solution called Frasers Plus, 
which we’ve now rolled out across all 
our fascias. As well as giving us deep 
customer insights, Frasers Plus will 
include a consumer loyalty program, 
where you will be able to redeem 
rewards and points across the  
whole ecosystem.

We’re always thinking about how 
we can diversify our business and 
keep our consumers in the Frasers 
ecosystem. For example, within our 
Sport business we have rolled out a 
fitness business with Everlast gyms, 
which now has over 70 gyms, which 
is effectively an elevated fitness and 
lifestyle proposition but with affordable 
price points. We have also acquired 
the number-one cycling business in 
the UK with Evans Cycles, and we have 
invested in the e-sports sector through 
our acquisition of GAME. 

Have you ever thought about 
investing in the sneaker space?
There are a lot of sneaker retailers that 
have invested heavily over the past few 
years and have grown globally. And 
that’s where we see the opportunity. 
That’s because you need much bigger 
stores in sporting goods to get true 
representation of different sports. 
You cannot just have the bestsellers; 
you’ve got to sell a number of brands, 
a number of products, and that takes 
up square footage that costs capital. 
When you’re in sporting goods, you 
have to be credible in all the key 
sports. And that makes the stores less 
productive than a sneaker store would 
be. So, you have to overinvest in the 
sports market for a low return. But it’s 
very difficult unless you have your own 
brand proposition. We’ve got a strong 
business with a strong balance sheet 
and can take a medium- to long-term 
view. This is how we can differentiate in 
sports and can be distinctive.

“Our ambition in any market we 
enter is to be number one by size 
or positioning – we want to be the 
number one partner of choice for 
our strategic sport brand partners.”

Mixed markets 
and polarized 
performance

Sporting goods companies expect business 
conditions to remain challenging in 2024,  
after a partial recovery in 2023. However,  
demand dynamics will likely vary across  
markets and segments, suggesting  
companies will need to tailor their 
strategies to local conditions.

The sporting goods market saw a 
welcome return to form in 2023, growing 
6 percent amid higher revenues across 
almost all geographies.5 But there were 
variations across regions. Western 
Europe posted growth of 8 percent, 
a strong rebound from the previous 
year’s 3 percent decline. Income in 
Asia Pacific rose 11 percent, after 
a 4 percent decline in 2022. North 
America, meanwhile, grew 2 percent, 
building on its 6 percent expansion in 
2022. Latin America was the standout 

performer, with growth of 22 percent 
after 20 percent growth the previous 
year. Looking ahead, analysts expect 
the industry to broadly continue on its 
current path, amid annual growth of  
7 percent up to 2027 (Exhibit 1).

The recent uptick in performance seems 
to put the industry back on a firm footing 
after the challenges of 2022. And 
sentiment is broadly positive for 2024, 
with about 90 percent of companies in 
our annual executive survey saying they 
think sales will pick up or remain steady. 

No companies are expecting both sales 
to fall and margins to contract. Still,  
81 percent of respondents say inflation 
and inventory levels/ cost of capital are 
causes for concern, and 50 percent 
worry about being able to attract talent 
and the rising pressure to become more 
sustainable.6 

Perhaps reflecting these themes, 
analysts are notably cautious for the 
year ahead, raising the 2023-4 growth 
outlook for 50 percent of companies 
but cutting it for the other 50 percent.7

In some geographies, this represents a 
turnaround from the previous consensus. 
After exceptionally high expectations 
for China in 2022, for example, many 
analysts are now revising their outlooks 
by a drop of as much as ten percentage 
points (Exhibit 2). Most analysts expect 
margins to remain close to where they 
were in the past year, albeit with a few 
exceptions. 

Where to play?
The regions offering the most promise 
for the coming period are Latin America 
and Southeast Asia, reflecting recent 
growth trends.8 Both geographies 
start from a lower base than more 
developed markets and will benefit 
from accelerating wealth creation, 
leading to higher levels of disposable 
income. Echoing global trends, they are 
also seeing increasing consumer focus 
on healthy lifestyles.  

Still, not all geographies are likely to tell 
positive stories. In China, 2023 marked 
a recovery from a tough 2022, but many 

Chinese consumers are likely to trade 
down in 2024 as economic headwinds 
persist. In addition, companies that 
have seen intensifying competition 
over recent years can expect more of 
the same, with a growing array of local 
players competing with international 
brands, amid rising patriotism and 
strong government funding for sports.

For international brands, the Latin 
American market should present an 
opportunity. Indeed, overseas players 
have consistently accounted for about 
90 percent of the market since 2017.9 
Nike and adidas are leading in the 
dominant soccer category, while a host 
of competitors are benefitting from 
rising consumer interest in wellness 
and well-being. Especially tennis is 
seeing increasing participation in 
countries such as Mexico.

Given a highly differentiated economic 
and market outlook, brands in 2024 
will need to tailor their strategies to 
conditions in individual markets. In

China, for example, companies could 
explore working with local athletes 
that are increasingly prominent on 
the global stage. In Latin America, by 
contrast, the growth opportunity will 
probably be concentrated in expanding 
brand presence across markets.

Strategic differentiation
In an unpredictable market environment, 
a key trend is rising levels of polarization, 
with some companies performing 
much better than others. About a third 
of sporting goods companies have 
grown revenues and widened margins 
since 2017, forming an elite group 
of super winners that consistently 
outperform (Exhibit 3). On average, this 
group has achieved organic growth 
of five percentage points and margin 
improvements of three percentage 
points over the recent period. Conversely, 
about a quarter of companies have 
been margin-accretive laggards – 
meaning they have lifted margins but not 
revenues. About 10 percent are dilutive 
laggards – seeing strong revenue 
performance (+15 percent) but slightly 
negative margin performance  
(-2 percentage points on average). 
Looking to the future, we expect this 
polarization theme to persist.

Super winners have set themselves 
apart through their ability to perform 
consistently despite unpredictable 
market conditions. Indeed, 100 percent 
of accretive growers have expanded 
80 percent of the time, with 23 percent 
managing to grow in all of the past five 
years, McKinsey research shows.

Still, strong performance is not 
restricted to a single business model 
or strategy. Leading large cap retailers 
in the accretive grower group, for 
example, have prioritized in-store 
experiences, locking in premium brand 
partnerships and increasing brand 
coverage. DICK’S Sporting Goods and 
JD Sports, for instance, have mastered 
omnichannel propositions and 
pioneered innovative store concepts 
and a great customer experience – JD’s 
partnership with augmented reality 
company Zero10 for in-store AR-fitting 
mirrors was one example. Companies 
that attracted customers through these 
innovations made themselves go-to 
options for the big brands. Many of 
these, after a love affair with direct-to-
consumer business models, are again 
seeing retail partners as essential 
champions and ambassadors. Retailers 
have also expanded their brand

“The difficult thing in the current 
environment is that so many variables 
are changing at one time […] most 
brands and retailers built too much 
inventory, so 2024 is therefore going 
to be a little bit of a cleanup year.”

coverage, adding companies such as 
On and New Balance to attract more 
footfall to their stores.

Meanwhile, large cap brands such 
as PUMA and Li Ning have benefited 
from excellent market timing – offering 
the right product - for example in the 
popular premium athleisure and retro 
categories - at the right time. Brands 
have also targeted large and fast-
growing economies. And many have 
adjusted their channel strategies – 
aiming to cater to underserved supply 
white spots in wholesale after the shift 
of bigger players to DTC.

Finally, large cap commoditized 
manufacturers such as Giant 
Manufacturing and Merida Industry 
have become more cost competitive 
through scale, sophisticated demand 
planning, and diversification of 
production facilities, as well leaner, 
low-cost operating models. Meanwhile, 
specialized players have sought to 
attract premium brands by adopting 
higher standards; for example, in 
relation to sustainability, or by creating 
differentiating features through 
extensive R&D. 

Margin-accretive and growing 
small cap companies, such as 
RevolutionRace and La Sportiva in 

clothing and apparel, Alpinestars in the 
outdoor segment, and PowaKaddy in 
golf, have adopted a range of strategies 
to accelerate their expansion. Many 
apparel players, for example, have 
prioritized a strong DTC focus from 
the beginning. This gives companies 
the ability to expand rapidly, reduce 
overheads, and therefore compete 
strongly on price, as well as be more 
flexible in testing and refining value 
propositions. In the outdoor space, 
promising businesses have developed 
specialized innovations and committed 
to R&D to build brand heritage: “The 
first company to…” is a powerful 
message. A common theme across 
the segment is to target niche sports 
enthusiasts before aiming for mass 
market scale-up. And many companies 
have sought out elite athlete 
endorsements, as seen in Babolat’s 
association with rising tennis star 
Carlos Alcaraz.

In 2024, companies that are able to 
execute on these nuts and bolts of 
performance will be the ones to watch, 
and leading companies will not sit still, 
continuously refining their business 
models to align with shifting  
consumer demand.

and 2022 trajectory, and they wanted 
to exit before the reality of 2023 and 
2024 is too visible.

To be self-critical, one thing we missed 
at XXL was polarization of demand 
to premium and value. In the Nordics, 
the fastest-growing segment is outlet. 
And that’s not the traditional outlet 
anymore, it is sourced for outlet. So, 
we went from being a very strong 
value proposition across most of the 
spectrum to being a little squeezed 
in the middle. We reformulated the 
strategy on that basis.

Where do you think the investment 
priorities for the industry should be in 
the next year?
At Odlo, we invest mainly in improving 
gross margin through quality and 
productivity in our manufacturing. 
We are lucky to produce 80% of our 
products in our own three factories 
in Europe, and have seen a lot of 
improvement in productivity, especially 
in Romania, where we have doubled 
capacity and increased productivity by 
almost 40 percent. Important sources 
are a very low attrition rate, and we 
are approaching ten years of average 
tenure. We work in one shift, so our 
employees can get their kids to school 
in the morning and will be there for 
dinner at night, which means they have 
a better life, are much more motivated, 
and do great work.

We also invest more and more in R&D 
and the development of fabrics. We 
are kind of fabric nerds. The founder of 
Odlo invented technical sport apparel, 
Janus has knitted wool for 127 years,  

Hugo Maurstad is Managing Partner 
at Monte Rosa Capital (Owner of 
Odlo, Janus and Henri-Lloyd). He has 
managed several investments and 
turnarounds in the sports and leisure 
industry, including Helly Hansen, 
Rossignol, Navico, SATS, XXL, Odlo, 
Janus, and Henri-Lloyd.

What is your perspective on the 
current economic and market 
environment, and what’s the most 
important thing when it comes to 
industry performance in 2024?
I think the difficult thing in the current 
environment is that so many variables 
are changing at one time – COVID-19 
-related shutdowns, supply chain 
disruptions, geopolitical uncertainty 
and inflation. Getting into this season, 
most brands and retailers built too 
much inventory, so 2024 is therefore 
going to be a little bit of a cleanup year. 

However, I strongly believe in 
underlying growth in the sector. One 
thing consumers take away from the 
COVID-19 pandemic is how important 
exercise is for health. I think we will 
see much more focus on longevity and 
health span going forward. It’s healthy 
to be active, and there is an increasing 
understanding of how it impacts our 

most severe diseases like diabetes, 
Alzheimer’s, cancer, and cardiovascular 
diseases. 

How do you see interest rates and 
inflation impacting the industry 
going forward?
The main objective of increasing 
interest rates is to reduce purchase 
power. Otherwise, you would not be 
able to reduce inflation. So, by design, 
it reduces demand - that’s why I don’t 
think we are going to have a super 
strong year. But this hits harder on 
larger items like cars, vacations, and 
refurbishing your home. So that’s why 
I don’t think the effect is going to be 
dramatic. I would say we will see very 
low single-digit growth in the market 
overall, but there will be winners  
and losers. 

In retail, you have the challenge of 
operational leverage, paired in many 
cases with not very strong balance 
sheets. If you add too much inventory, 
it becomes challenging. I expect 
that we will see some accelerated 
consolidation. Similarly for brands, 
we have been offered brands for sale 
weekly during the last year. Everyone 
is trying to build a case where they 
extrapolate future sales on the 2021

“I’ve only tried to restructure 
things that have at some point 
been good. [...] The first thing 
we do is go back to the core.”

and the founder of Henri-Lloyd 
invented taped seams. We continue 
this heritage and also bring the product 
developers and designers together 
with the manufacturing people to learn 
how we can make the garment even 
better. It is our “design-to-cost-and-
quality” process. 

The third thing we are focusing on is 
speed; three weeks from design to store. 
Of course, you’re not going to do that on 
our whole collection. But we do it for all 
our “never-out-of-stock” items and for 
special offerings like Black Friday.

What are your thoughts on channels?
I think the wholesale channel is going to 
get a little bit of renewed love. There’s a 
limit on how much you can shop on that 
single-brand channel. Most customers 
want to go to a ski, shoe, or base-layer 
store and view products from different 
brands. Some brands, including us, 
have been a little bit naive in terms of 
how much traffic you can generate 
just for a single-brand store. So, going 
forward, I think there’s definitely going 
to be room for good multibrand stores, 
both bricks and mortar and digital.

You have acquired a number of 
sporting goods brands and retailers 
and restructured them – what is your 
recipe for restructuring? 
I’ve only tried to restructure things that 
have at some point been good. I’ve never 
tried to make something good that does 
not have something great in its heritage. 
The first thing we do is go back to the 
core; what was it that really made this 
brand – and how can we recreate that 
magic? We cut out products or price 

points that we don’t think they should 
play in. We bring the basics back. I 
love working with heritage brands. As 
an example, at Henry Lloyd, our new 
designer went back to the history. He 
went on eBay and bought a lot of the old 
jackets and used those as inspiration 
to create ten new jackets. I think he 
did a fantastic job, and that’s exactly 
what we tried to do at Helly Hansen and 
Rossignol. That’s how you actually find 
the soul of the brand again. When you 
get the brand positioning right, then 
you can be more brutal on costs and 
productivity, aspiring to world-class 
operational performance. 

But eventually most companies 
grow by expanding into adjacent 
categories and products – how does 
that align with your recipe?
Yes absolutely, it’s important to expand 
at some point, but you need to do that 
from a strong position. You see a lot of 
brands explode their SKUs when they 
are weak, because they try to find every 
little corner where they can make a 
buck. But when you do it from a strong 
position, then you have to do it for real 
and not be “half-pregnant”. When 
entering a new category, it’s a real 
investment, and we’re going to invest 
for three to five years. 

Do you see a trend to move away from 
competitiveness and move toward 
inclusiveness and encouraging all 
kinds of activity?
Yes, Odlo is actually doing a campaign 
on that this winter. We’re using Martin 
Fourcade as our front figure for exactly 
that, because he used to be the most 

winning biathlete in history. But he 
stopped competing in 2020. He’s still 
incredibly active in everything from 
cross-country skiing to ski touring, 
gravel biking, mountain biking, and 
running, but it’s no longer about winning. 
It’s about showing people that there’s 
more out there, getting people to go 
out and explore, getting back to being 
active, and enjoying the experience 
more than winning every time.

Are you also doing this to target older 
generations?
Yes absolutely. I’m the chairman of 
SATS, a fitness group with 275 gyms 
in the Nordics. There, we experience 
steady growth in the segment over 65, 
and we run a lot of special programs 
for them. The growth of that segment 
in terms of activity is very high. And of 
course, it’s almost even more important 
for this segment to stay active and 
agile, and you see that reflected in how 
they buy apparel and sports equipment.

However, when we design products, 
instead of designing for different 
segments or age groups, we think 
about our “muse” – who do our 
customers aspire to be. Our muse 
is a mid-30s reawakened athlete 
who likes to be out and about, but is 
not competitive and is active across 
multiple sports. And of course, we have 
customers who don’t want to dress like 
a 25-year-old. But they could dress like 
a 35-year-old. They appreciate high-
quality fabrics, simple cuts, not too 
much color. And that way, we can serve 
a wide spectrum of age groups.

—

A discussion with Alexander Sukharevsky, 
Global Leader QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey 
and a leading voice on artificial intelligence.

Alex, what do you believe will be the 
biggest changes for sporting goods 
companies driven or enabled by AI  
over the next five to ten years  in their 
interactions with their consumers?
One aspect is deeply emotional, 
centering on the consumer experience. 
The essence of this evolution lies in 
our newfound ability to interact with 
technology using our natural language. 
This includes typing, speaking, and 
expressing ourselves in unstructured 
ways while still receiving coherent 
responses. This innovation transcends 
mere sporting goods; it fundamentally 
alters our social contract and the 
manner in which we engage with the 
world. Imagine a scenario where a 
virtual assistant orchestrates your 
daily schedule, aids in managing your 
diet, organizes your training regimen, 
and assists in selecting the perfect 

sporting equipment tailored to your 
specific needs, all at an exceptionally 
affordable cost. This cost efficiency is 
akin to how the internet revolutionized 
the distribution of content and 
digital assets, while generative AI is 
transforming creativity.

This assistant redefines our 
interactions, particularly in the realm  
of shopping or sports, by employing 
novel tools. This, I believe, is the 
foremost change.

Second, consumers are increasingly 
driven by value. If technology can 
provide the same value at a significantly 
reduced cost, disrupting traditional 
cost structures, it garners my full 
support. This paradigm shift offers 
a unique consumer interface and a 
fundamentally different cost structure, 
delivering immense value both

emotionally and monetarily. This is  
the crux of the transformation we  
are witnessing.

To make it concrete, how could 
someone who wants to be active and 
is currently trying to use apps and 
virtual coaching benefit from AI in 
the future?
Consider the current pursuit of health 
and wellness. At its core, it’s a matter 
of mindset, and there are fundamental 
actions each individual must undertake. 
We are, and will remain, human beings 
with inherent needs, as identified by 
Max-Neef. These needs are constant, 
but the methods of addressing them 
evolve. Today, embarking on a healthier 
lifestyle requires a deep understanding 
of one’s physical capabilities and 
limitations, necessitating various 
tests and assessments. One must 
then determine the ideal environment 
for exercise, select the appropriate 
equipment and apparel for both safety 
and style, and meticulously plan diet 
and rest.

As consumers, we orchestrate these 
needs independently, seeking the best 
options for each aspect. Now, imagine 
a world where managing these needs is 
as simple as hailing a taxi with the press 
of a button. You state your destination 

and the rest is taken care of. This ease 
could apply to all aspects of health 
and wellness. Whether it’s losing 
weight, boosting energy, or achieving 
other health goals, technology can 
streamline this process.

Generative AI is just one piece 
of this puzzle, alongside virtual 
reality and Web 3.0, all contributing 
to a transformative sports and 
health ecosystem. This synergy of 
technologies redefines the consumer 
journey in health and fitness. It 
becomes friendlier, more customized, 
and truly personalized on a large 
scale. What’s more, it is surprisingly 
affordable. The once elusive concept 
of an integrated ecosystem, long 
discussed but rarely achieved, now 
becomes a reality.

With these advancements, individuals 
can focus more on actual exercise, 
healthier eating, and self-improvement, 
rather than getting bogged down in 
scheduling and research. Of course, 
there’s still a place for personal 
research and customization of 
virtual assistants to suit individual 
preferences. But fundamentally, this 
technology spares us the routine 
legwork, allowing us to concentrate on 
becoming our best selves.

In a world where that has become 
the kind of new normal for active 
people, what will differentiate which 
companies will be winners and 
losers in this domain? And what do 
companies already need to do now  
to make sure they prepare for  
this future?
Let’s contemplate the future of AI in 
sports, recognizing that we’re still at the 
dawn of its awareness and deployment. 
Just two to three months ago, ten 
million software engineers began 
exploring these tools, marking the start 
of a transformative journey. For sports 
companies aiming to succeed, several 
key trends demand attention.

First, companies must reevaluate their 
business models and the broader 
implications for their industry. This 
includes reimagining customer 
journeys and deciding whether to offer 
personalized services or integrate into 
existing ecosystems. The question of 
brand positioning is critical – whether 
to remain a distinct entity or adapt 
to a private label model. Success 
hinges on those who forge the closest 
connections with consumers.

Second, beyond the allure of 
technology lies the practicality of data 
management, IT infrastructure, risk, 

“Imagine a scenario where a 
virtual assistant orchestrates 
your daily schedule, aids in 
managing your diet, organizes 
your training regimen, and 
assists in selecting the perfect 
sporting equipment tailored 
to your specific needs.”

27

Sporting Goods 2024and change management. It’s essential 
to establish a robust framework 
capable of integrating and operating 
multiple technologies. This preparation 
forms the backbone of any tech-driven 
strategy.

Third, and maybe most importantly, 
it is about the strength of your brand. 
A strong brand that is trusted and 
beloved will enable you to differentiate 
in a world that is becoming more and 
more tech driven.

Many companies struggle with the 
question of where and how to start. 
Can you provide some guidance on 
this?
The journey toward harnessing 
technology in the sports industry 
begins with education. We must dispel 
the notion that a concept’s worth is 
measured by our ability to explain it 
quickly, especially in technology. It’s 
crucial to educate our most creative 
and disruptive teams in understanding 
the possibilities that technology 
offers, encouraging them to rethink 
their approaches over several weeks. 
Leadership from top management, 
including the chairman, CEO, and board 
members, is essential in guiding this 
process of reinvention. Knowledge, 
personal commitment, and conviction 
are key.

“Generative AI is just 
one piece of this puzzle, 
alongside virtual 
reality and Web 3.0, 
all contributing to a 
transformative sports 
and health ecosystem.”

When it comes to impact and 
prioritization, the focus could initially 
be on enhancing productivity. While 
generative AI contributes to this, it’s 
just a portion (around 20 to 40 percent 
depending on the sector) of the 
broader array of AI techniques that can 
revolutionize various operations, from 
replenishment and pricing to logistics 
and forecasting. The goal is to first 
establish a conviction that AI unlocks 
real value.

However, this doesn’t mean neglecting 
longer-term, strategic transformations 
in key domains. In the consumer goods 
and sports industries, guest interaction 
is paramount. But there’s also 
significant potential in managing the 
value chain and back-office operations. 
This includes everything from customer 
care to inventory management and 
encouraging customer participation in 
product creation.

The concept of co-creation, perhaps 
facilitated by blockchain technology, 
offers a unique opportunity. Despite 
the skepticism around NFTs, they 
represent a form of customer 
engagement with potential benefits. 
This approach could encompass 
various areas, including accounting 
and administration, enhancing them 
through technology.

Ultimately, the focus shouldn’t be solely 
on artificial intelligence, but rather 
on hybrid intelligence – the synergy 
of human and machine capabilities. 
Artificial intelligence is less about 
replacing human ability and more about 
augmenting it, transforming AI into a 
tool as ubiquitous and essential as the 
spreadsheet.

At McKinsey, you lead QuantumBlack 
globally and you advise many 
companies, of course, not only in 
the sporting goods world, on such 
transformations. What is your 
message on where the most mistakes 
are currently being made, what to 
avoid, and how to get it right now?
First, a common oversight among 
many companies is their eagerness to 
dive into specific use cases without 
thoroughly reevaluating the essence

of their business and key domains. A 
mere fraction, perhaps only 10 percent, 
are dedicating sufficient attention to 
the long-term ramifications, which 
are crucial not just for mitigating risks 
but also for seizing opportunities. The 
pivotal question for any organization 
is the robustness of their competitive 
advantage and their capacity to 
enhance and leverage it creatively. 
Thus, a significant part of the strategy 
should involve a deep reflection on 
these aspects.

Second, while many organizations 
engage in numerous proofs of 
concept (POC), the real challenge 
lies in effective scaling. Statistics 
indicate a striking reality: only about 
one in ten POC transitions into actual 
production, meaning a minimal impact 
on the organization. With generative 
AI, this figure is even lower. The key is 

transitioning from a novel concept to 
an integral part of the organizational 
structure. This requires a dual focus: on 
strategic vision and on the practicalities 
of scaling.

Additionally, while the enthusiasm 
for technology investment is 
understandable, equal emphasis must 
be placed on the human element. For 
every dollar spent on technology, a 
proportionate investment in change 
management and education is 
essential. This encompasses not just 
organizational training, but also the 
personal development of each team 
member. In sum, the focus should be 
on a balanced approach that prioritizes 
both technological advancement 
and human resource development. 
Generative AI could be viewed as a 
“gym” for a lifelong learning journey.

Overview of McKinsey’s Generative AI assets
McKinsey supports sporting goods players on AI through “QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey”. QuantumBlack employs 
more than 2,000 software, data, and cloud engineers, 1,500+ data scientists, 400+ product owners, and 850+ product 
owners and agile coaches. QuantumBlack has developed several GenAI assets, including:

 — HyPe (hyper-personalization) 
by CustomerOne: The next 
generation of AI-powered 
personalization, where analytical 
AI (e.g., recommendations 
on the next-best product or 
channel) meets generative AI 
(e.g., individual content creation 
for each customer) to enable 
companies to move toward 
segments-of-one in their 
customer engagement strategies. 
We have seen significant impact 
proven at many retailers (sporting 
goods and others), such as 10 to 
20 percent revenue growth, 30 
percent conversion rate uplift, 
and 70+ percent cost savings.

 — CommercialX: Our commercial 
analytics engine uses GenAI 
to enrich product attributes or 
create more explainable customer 
decision trees, as an addition to 
our more traditional pricing, promo, 
and assortment analytics, where 
we, e.g., see 400 to 800 bps 
improvement in markdown sales.

 — Virtual subject-matter expert 
(SME) toolkit: Our modular 
toolkit enables construction of 
SME, chatbots, and more – based 
on a flexible set of building blocks 
that, e.g., handle data bases, LLM 
access, or post-processing. This 
can be leveraged by sporting 

goods players to, e.g., support 
marketing, customer service, or 
create customer-facing chatbots 
to explore the assortment.

 — Data- and developer-centric 
assets: We have a range of 
assets that support data- and 
IT organizations, including 
GenAI4DO, which helps create 
data products and make data 
more consumable across the 
enterprise; AI4DQ (AI for Data 
Quality), which helps ensure data 
quality across the enterprise; or 
LegacyX, which helps migrate 
code from legacy software stacks 
to current ones.

Across these, we use a highly modular approach based on our QB Horizon  
suite (including our recent acquisition of Iguazio) to ensure that our clients  
scale AI beyond proofs of concept.

participation, sporting goods companies have an 
opportunity to unlock new pockets of value.

From China to Japan, the US, and 
Brazil, consumers are having a tough 
time, with high inflation eroding 
incomes and creating economic 
uncertainty. Indexes of consumer 
confidence in most regions of the 
world fell sharply in 2022 and only 
partially recovered in 2023 as inflation 
started to abate in some geographies. 
However, confidence remains below 
where it was even at the height of  
the pandemic.

The strength of feeling about the rising 
cost of living is borne out by McKinsey 
Europe’s Consumer Pulse Survey, 
which showed in late 2023 that rising 
prices were impacting consumer 
confidence in every geography. 
Between 40 and 60 percent of all 
respondents saw rising prices as one 
of their top three concerns. Climate 
change, the impacts of which were 
seen in multiple extreme weather 
events over the past year, was in 
second place, with job security in third 
(Exhibit 4). 

From August 2023, economic 
headwinds had a rising impact on 

purchasing volumes, price sensitivity, 
and brand loyalty, with consumers 
showing more inclination to switch to 
new brands and retailers or even delay 
purchases. Brands will need to work 
harder in future to foster engagement 
and reinforce their propositions. 

Participation over performance
Sports participation is rising in some 
geographies. In the US, about  
78 percent of the population identifies 
as being “active”10 compared with  
73 percent in 2017, after five years of 
consecutive increases. Higher-income 
cohorts are the most active of all, while 
those earning less than $25,000 a year 
are least active.11

In Europe, a more nuanced narrative 
is playing out, with variations in 
participation across geographies. 
Since 2017, inactivity has increased the 
most in Poland, Hungary, Portugal, and 
Lithuania. Meanwhile Germany, France, 
Italy, and others have seen declines 
in inactivity, while Latvia and Estonia 
recorded 23 percentage-point and  
18 percentage-point falls respectively. 
Overall, 45 percent of European

respondents say that they never 
exercise or play sport. Some  
38 percent take part at least once a 
week and 6 percent report exercising 
five times a week or more.12 

A notable trend over the recent 
period has been a shift in the choice 
of sporting and well-being activities. 
More people are choosing sports that 
are quicker to pick up, require less 
commitment, and are more social, 
rather than organized sports with fixed 
time commitments, requiring teams, or 
where high levels of skill are required 
(Exhibit 5). Pickleball/paddle tennis, 
for example, has seen a 159 percent 
increase in participation since the 
pandemic, while off-course golf has 
posted a 57 percent rise. Trail running 
and cycling have recorded upticks of 
10-20 percent. Among companies 
seeing declining participation is skiing, 
where expense and climate change 
have driven a  
14 percent fall in the number of people 
taking part since the pandemic.13

The shift in sports participation also 
extends horizontally into health-
focused and wellness mindsets. As 
increasing numbers of people embrace 
a more holistic lifestyle – encapsulated 
by the “any physical movement is good” 
principle – people and companies are 
focusing more on the joy of movement, 
mindfulness, and the benefits of 
considering the whole self. Nike is 
among companies that have leaned 
into this trend through its Nike Well 
Collective (see interview with Nike’s 
Vanessa Garcia-Brito).

As sporting goods brands engage with 
behavior shifts, many will consider the 
demographic characteristics of the 
markets in which they operate. On that 
basis, the globe can be roughly divided 
into three groups – younger nations 
in which a large proportion of the 
population is under 30 (many African 

percent of survey respondents)  
and to a lesser extent, Europe  
(41 percent).14 Social media is often  
a key differentiator based on age 
and customized product offerings. 
Companies such as Intersport run 
different advertisements for different 
age groups.

In formulating go-to-market strategies, 
the traditional focus is on Gen Z, which 
represents 17 percent of the population 
based on McKinsey research published 
in 2019. This group accounts for 20 
percent of total spend, despite earning 
just 12 percent of income. Moreover, 
as time passes, the group is set to 
comprise a growing proportion of 
the total and will surpass Boomers 
by 2032.15 Indeed, by the end of 
this decade, Gen Z and Millennials 
will account for 51 percent of total 
household spending.16 

“Our product range at Nike isn’t 
just about catering to a specific age 
group; it’s more about accessibility. 
We want to ensure that whether 
someone is a jogger, walker, marathon 
runner […] they find something in 
our range that suits their needs.”

care about people and the environment 
and are transparent about their 
activities. Baby Boomers (representing 
32 percent of the population) are 
also aligned with these values, while 
generations between the two are less 
concerned.17 

Not surprisingly, younger generations 
are more digitally adept. However, 
they tend to prefer omnichannel 
experiences, rather than purely 
online experiences, with 60 percent 
using mobile instore and 50 percent 
demanding frictionless payments. They 
are also highly mobile, with 74 percent 
willing to switch brands where they 
don’t get a seamless experience across 
channels.18

In China, the wealth effect is lifting 
demand in some segments, after a   
10 percent annual growth in disposable 
income between 2010 and 2020. 
But the fastest spending growth up 
to 2025 is likely to be the in the 45+ 
group, with a CAGR of 8.3 percent to 
9.7 percent.19 This highlights a split 
between older generations who grew 
up in harder economic times and are 
focused on saving and investing, and 

younger generations who have lived 
with more affluence throughout their 
lives. Many in this group do not save 
or invest as much as their parents and 
grandparents and are expected to 
continue spending in the future. 

The demographic split in China 
presents sporting goods brands 
with an opportunity (Exhibit 6). While 
marketing campaigns are now mostly 
focused on younger consumers (with 
more women-focused campaigns, 
teen models, and highly colored 
assortments – both in products and 
stores), the older generation presents 
a relatively untapped demographic. As 
people continue spending on sports 
into their 50s, it will be incumbent on 
companies to find new ways to create 
excitement around their brands and 
unlock a potentially lucrative market.

The growing importance of the  
over-45 market is not restricted 
to China. Around the world, older 
generations are becoming more active. 
This reflects rising longevity and the 
fact that people are staying active 
for longer, with sport and well-being 
forming an important part of their lives.

Dan Sheridan is the President and Chief 
Operating Officer at Brooks Running. 
Dan leads the team with a specific focus 
on scaling Brooks’ unique business 
model, brand, and culture around the 
world. He is accountable for Brooks’ 
global and regional businesses and 
supply chain operations, along with IT 
and digital products functions.

How have you experienced the 
market environment in 2023 and 
what is your outlook for 2024?
It’s so different by region and by 
category. We are fortunate at Brooks 
because running has shown itself 
to be a recession-proof sport; it’s 
easy and affordable. This choice that 
people make for health and wellness 
is the reason that running exists 
around the world. So, what we’ve seen 
is that running is holding up really 
well. Now, there are some markets, 
the US specifically, where we are in 
an absolute boom for performance 
running. I’ve been in the industry for 
more than 25 years, and I’ve never seen 
anything like it! The running market in 
the US has grown about 5 or 6 percent 
annually. But if you slice it by premium, 
meaning running shoes sold above $75, 
it’s growing approximately 15 percent 
per year to date. 

From a macroeconomic perspective, 
the US consumers we speak to –
people in middle and upper-middle 
classes who have chosen to dedicate 
time to their health and wellness – 
have not specifically seen an impact 
on the economic side. Around the 
world, however, it’s different. In Europe, 
though it’s growing at low single digits, 
we’re seeing a pretty challenging 
market. The economy and consumer 
spending are somewhat muted, and 
we’re dealing with a lot of market 
challenges. It's economically and 
geopolitically driven, and energy costs 
are also impacting consumer spending. 
And so, in our core European market, 
we’re not seeing the growth rate we are 
seeing in the US And I think China is 
recovering – that’s what we’re seeing in 
sport and running specifically. We are 
new to that market but growing nicely. 

Do you think that the difference 
between, for example, Europe and 
the US is a temporary difference, 
or do you think fundamentally the 
European market is not on such a 
strong growth path as the US?
I might flip it and say that the US is 
on a trajectory that is the strongest 
we’ve seen in a very long time. So, the 
comparison to Europe is probably not 

36

fair. I would say, though, that consumer 
spending in the US versus Europe 
is always on different planes. I think 
Europe is dealing with a short-term 
challenge. But what is happening in the 
US is really incredible. We saw it coming 
at the end of 2021—all the fundamentals 
that lined up during COVID-19, where 
consumers weren’t traveling as much 
and got back into fitness, with running 
being the center of it. If you were in 
your late 40s and had given up running, 
you got back into running. If you only 
ran once a week, you started running 
three or four times a week. And, you 
know, children saw this behavior in their 
parents. And so that focus on an active, 
fitter lifestyle has carried forward into 
the younger generation. We also think 
this period drove trend and lifestyle 
– if you go to the airport, you will see 
everyone wearing running shoes again. 
We think this trend is going to be sticky 
for a while. 

Some of our best performance markets 
are in Europe. I think of Germany, I 
think of the Nordics, I think of France, 
all great sport markets with running at 
the center of everything they do. So, 
there are short-term headwinds, but 
we’re incredibly bullish on the ultimate 
growth of that market!

What types of runners are these 
customers?
In the US, let’s say there are 50 million 
people who run once a week. But there 
are 155 million people who run, walk, 
hike, use the treadmill, and engage in 
various activities around the sport of 
running. This larger group is engaging in 
fit, active lifestyles and is using running 
gear for their needs. We sell these 
fitness seekers, comfort seekers, and 
people who just want a great-looking 
comfortable shoe. And so in the US 
specifically, I think close to 65 percent 
of running shoes are sold without an 
intent to run. It’s for something else. A 
great running shoe is a great walking 

Sporting Goods 2024 
shoe; it’s a great shoe to go to the gym, 
hike, etc. COVID-19 created not only a 
reinforcement of health and wellness, 
including for people who maybe fell out of 
it, but it’s creating a generation behind it. 
And that’s a great thing for Brooks.

What have you done in the past  
12 months that has made Brooks  
so successful?
Without revealing our entire playbook, 
we’ve had a well-defined strategy that 
is focused on runners, the running 
community, and anyone who puts one 
foot in front of the other. You have a 
choice about who’s going to be your 
customer. And we chose people 
who move. And because of that, our 
execution underneath it is aligned to 
a multichannel retail strategy. And it’s 
different than a lot of our competitors. 
We believe runners choose where they 
engage with brands and where they 
research brands, where they shop for 
brands. And, therefore, we have to 
be where the runners are. That said, 
we choose the best running retailers 
around the world to represent our 
brand. And that multichannel strategy 
means that we don’t prioritize one 
channel over another. We’ve seen our 
competitors walk away from wholesale/
retail partners. And guess what – 
they’re all coming back to wholesale. 
Even the biggest brands can’t control 
where a runner wants to shop and 
engage. If there’s a running shop in your 
neighborhood, you are going to go in 
and talk to the best expert in that store. 
And so we’ve built our whole strategy 
around that. And underneath that 
is a distribution network, a planning 
cycle, an inventory cycle, a service 
model, a field rep engagement, and a 
marketing strategy that connects to a 
multichannel strategy.

We have a very robust direct-to-
consumer channel, but it doesn’t 
compete with our partners … it 
complements them. And that’s really 
hard to do. It’s also super hard to make 
sure you have balance in your channels. 
But we’ve been able to do it. So, our 
winning strategy is absolutely focused 
on the runner and people who put one 
foot in front of the other, and we build in 
a service model to support it all.

We observe a trend from organized 
sports to more social sports with lower 
barriers to entry and less focus on 
competition. Do you specifically target 
this with your Run Happy slogan?
Yeah, I think I think that’s a good 
insight. During COVID-19, more people 
than ever found that running has a low 
barrier to entry. Here in the US, we see 
participation growing in high school 
track and field and cross-country, 
which is always an indication of future 
runners. And you don’t have to buy a lot 
of equipment to take part. 

Run Happy has always been our 
kind of whitespace. We believe the 
message is something that resonates 
with most people as it lacks judgment. 
It’s actually an invitation. And, more 
importantly, during COVID-19, it was a 
lifesaver for many people as they were 
in lockdown. So, we’re very proud of 
our brand position, and we execute 
upon it globally. It resonates in every 
community in which we do business.

By the way, we’re watching other 
brands’ expressions, and most brands 
are coming into the space we’ve owned, 
so it’s time we get our elbows out and 
express our brand in a way that remains 
unique yet still authentic to Brooks. 

Do you see an opportunity to serve 
older generations? 
Because we sell a premium performance 
product at a premium price, we’ve 
tended to lean a bit older in terms of the 
consumer who can afford our products. 
But what we’ve seen over the last four 
years is that the younger generation – 

Gen Z, Gen X – are not afraid to pay up 
for premium. Our core market is 18 to  
35 year olds. The truth, though, is that 
we are seeing longevity creating a bigger 
addressable market. And I think that’s 
a long-term trend. Our demographic is 
shifting, and that’s exciting because it 
creates lifetime value for us!

You mentioned the topic of planning 
as one key element of your strategy. 
Tell us more about what drives your 
success with planning?
This is a big challenge for any company 
at scale and even smaller companies. 
And we’ve always had an incredible 
focus on this at Brooks. When we were 
small and insignificant, we knew we 
could squeak out 10 or 15 percent more 
every single year, if we managed our 
process and our planning to make sure 
we had the inventory at the right time to 
deliver to retailers. 

The last three and a half years for 
us and the rest of the industry have 
been super hard on supply chain and 
planning. You could have had the 
greatest plan ever and it didn’t matter. 
So, it’s really about agility and the 
process underneath. In addition, we’re 
now embarking on a new system for 
integrated planning. It’s an end-to-end 
planning system to connect our entire 
supply chain and continue to deliver the 
right inventory at the right time. But the 
truth is that there’s going to be more 
disruption. We’re trying to create the 
necessary agility and flexibility in our 
process to absorb the challenges in the 
global supply chain.

“You have a choice about who’s 
going to be your customer. 
And we chose people who 
move. And because of that, 
our execution underneath 
it is aligned to a multi-
channel retail strategy.”

Sky-high stock levels, a rising cost of capital, 
and surging promotions mean sporting goods 
companies need to think again about planning 
processes, data, and analytics. Through advanced 
approaches, they can create more tailored solutions 
and support faster, fact-based decision making.

“Our planning strategy 
is centered on aligning 
supply with demand as 
best as possible. We’ve 
invested substantially 
in data analysis and 
diversified our supply 
chain to ensure we 
have the right product 
at the right time.” 

— Stephanie Linnartz, President and Chief Executive Officer, Under Armour

By failing to prepare, you prepare 
to fail. Over the recent period, many 
sporting goods companies have found 
this old adage to be accurate, amid 
supply/demand imbalances caused 
first by manufacturing bottlenecks and 
then later by stockpiling, cost concerns, 
and product shortages. With demand 
cycles less predictable than before the 
pandemic, many companies  
over-ordered stock in 2023—a reality 
that has catapulted planning to the top 
of C-Suite agendas. 

For now, the primary focus of new 
planning initiatives is on inventories, 
which continue to present sporting 
goods companies with challenges. 
Since the second half of 2022, 
supply chain volatility associated with 
stockpiling has normalized but demand 
volatility has persisted (Exhibit 7). 
About 80 percent of respondents to 
the McKinsey & WFSGI Sporting Goods 
Industry Report Survey 2023 say that 
they had a higher inventory peak year-
on-year in 2023, and for half of those 
companies, the peak had risen by more 
than 20 percent. Indeed, the average 
peak among all respondents was about 
a third higher than a year previously, 
and more than half of companies

expected overstocking to be a 
persistent problem.20 Not surprisingly, 
discounting spiked, with companies on 
average putting 35 percent markdowns 
on 25-55 percent of assortments.21 

Taking all of that into account, executive 
teams in the coming year are set to 
focus more purposefully on planning, 
rather than tactical adjustments to 
stock levels. Indeed, companies’ past 
planning processes, calibrated to less 
volatile times, have become outdated in 
today’s more volatile environment. And 
improving planning capabilities is cited 
by 70 percent of executives as their 
top priority, ahead of reducing order 
volumes or running promotions.22 

Another reason that companies must 
plan better is that the cost of money 
is rising. US-benchmark 10-year 
rates have increased by as much as 
three percentage points since 2020, 
suggesting the era of cheap money 

is well and truly over.23 This puts more 
pressure on every dollar of companies’ 
excess inventories.

The benefits of integrated planning
Leaders are now recognizing that 
meeting financial targets, forecasting 
demand effectively, and managing 
supply capabilities are often predicated 
on effective integrated business 
planning (IBP). This cross-functional 
process is designed to ensure 
that all parts of the organization 
are aligned on plans and possible 
contingencies. Best-in-class IBP 
navigates uncertainty by establishing 
multiple levels of planning and decision 
gates – assessed annually, quarterly, 
and monthly. IBP decisions are 
company decisions, rather than purely 
operational or commercial choices. 
They are also agile, meaning they  
can be adjusted quickly if the situation 
changes. 

IBP generates impact because it 
creates cross-functional visibility, 
which means companies can align 
sales goals with demand forecasts, 
get a clear view of supply chains and 
constraints, and generate helpful 
models of future scenarios, for 
example, in respect of inventories. 
It also helps leaders make timely 
decisions based on data. This, in turn, 
will drive accountability. And IBP means 
decision making is more likely to be at 
the right time and with the right level of 
granularity. This will enable companies 
to invest precisely to support demand 
and plan ahead to manage inventory 
run downs. Finally, IBP generates the 
strategic benefit of aligning decision 
makers on a common direction of 
travel. Through a forward-looking lens, 
backed by weekly or monthly planning 
catch ups, they can agree on actions 
and drive stakeholders in a common 
direction.

McKinsey’s survey of supply chain 
leaders shows that leading sporting 
goods companies are embracing 
IBP on three key fronts: revising 
planning meeting governance and 
processes with cross-functional 
alignments; equipping supply chains 
with advanced analytics and artificial 
intelligence; and investing in advanced 
planning systems. About 71 percent 
of respondents to the survey plan 
to standardize and formalize their 
planning processes over the next three 
years. Meanwhile, 58 percent are set to 
implement advanced analytics over the 
same period (Exhibit 8).

Through these initiatives, companies 
can achieve substantial P&L impacts. 
We estimate they can boost capital 
efficiency (for example, improve 
inventory push and overall equipment 
effectiveness (OEE)) by up to 10 percent 
and lift sales by up to 2 percent. They 
can reduce general costs by as much 
as 6 percent and cut logistics costs 
by 2 percent. In addition, there is an 
opportunity to serve customers better, 
for example, by reducing lead times 
and increasing delivery reliability. All 
taken, these could boost employee 
engagement by 20-25 percent. 

Planning processes as a key 
differentiator
Corporate leaders understand that the 
scope of planning must necessarily 
be wide, encompassing a range of 
functions to create synergies and ensure 
completeness. All of these should be 
incorporated into a single unified plan on 
which all functions are aligned (through 
clarified RACIs and standardized  
inputs / outputs) (Exhibit 9). Companies 
that have embraced this integrated 
approach have seen three distinct 
benefits: better planning accuracy, 
stronger stakeholder buy-in, and 
nimbler cross-functional reactions. 

Of course, there is no one-size fits all 
solution that can be applied across 
sporting goods assortments. For 
example, supply chain plans for  
slow-moving SKUs or SKUs with 
predictable demand should be 
calibrated for cost efficiencies. If 
demand is less predictable,  
slow-moving SKUs and fast-moving 
SKUs with high stock risk require 
plans optimized for responsiveness 
(that is, immediate reaction to demand 
changes). Finally, fast-moving SKUs 
with low stock risk should be assigned 
plans for flexibility, such as the ability to 
tweak pricing or delivery times.

“The last three and a half years for 
us and the rest of the industry have 
been super hard on supply chain and

a new system for integrated planning. 
It’s an end-to-end planning system to

solid architecture, for example good 
governance, and designed for agility 
to respond rapidly to changes in the 
marketplace. Business planning should 
be aligned with financial planning, so 
that decision makers can read across 
from one to the other. Equally, senior 
leadership teams must set a consistent 
tone and be willing to invest in change 
management and capability building. 

As in all complex projects, it makes 
sense to start small and adopt a 
mindset of continuous improvement, 
gradually refining the process based 
on business needs and value creation 
opportunities. Through these success 
factors, companies can connect the 
dots, ensure leadership alignment, and 
create a process that is fit for purpose 
in a fast-changing world.

That said, many aspects can be 
standardized. The planning process 
itself will benefit from a regular 
cadence and clear objectives. Meetings 
will be most successful where there are 
prescribed roles, including a meeting 
owner to prepare content and lead 
engagement with the IBP coordinator, 
a meeting coordinator to support the 
owner and prepare and track KPIs, 
decision makers, who should be fully 
informed of data inputs ahead of the 
meeting, and, finally, experts and 
integrators to elucidate constraints and 
help identify solutions.

Leveraging new technologies
Accurate planning is predicated on 
having the right facts on hand at the 
right time. To make best use of their 
resources, some companies are 
building centralized repositories, or 
data lakes, designed to store, process, 
and secure large amounts of structured 
and unstructured data (mainly text). 

Through better managed data, 
companies can implement advanced 
applications such as machine learning 
and artificial intelligence, leading to 
much faster insights than are possible 
through human data crunching. For 
example, a data-driven approach 
to demand planning can generate 

an accurate statistical forecast 
for individual building blocks of 
demand, enabling responses tailored 
to situations. For new products, 
innovations such as look-alike 
modeling and analysis of expected 
values can ensure companies make 
informed decisions and predict where 
probabilities lie.

Excellent data will also provide the 
raw materials for advanced planning 
systems (APS), which bring together 
process and analytical elements to 
streamline the planning process. 
Companies can ensure all key 
planning issues are addressed at 
the appropriate cadence (strategic 
annually, demand planning monthly, 
scheduling daily, and so forth). At the 
same time, they can work on different 
elements in parallel—for example, all 
elements in the supply chain. They can 
also process complex decisions, such 
as bi-directional change propagation 
(meaning upstream or downstream 
impacts are adjusted simultaneously), 
meaning they can think on their feet as 
circumstances change.

To bring IBP to life, leaders must first 
lay the groundwork, aligned with the 
company’s strategy and operating 
model. IBP must be founded on a

Do you see a trade-off between 
inclusiveness and performance?
No – inclusivity in sports is growing, 
complementing competitive athletics. 
The post-pandemic acceleration 
towards fitness and community 
brings more diverse groups into 
sports, including women and people 
of color. At Under Armour, we target 
16- to 24-year-old varsity/team sport 
athletes, which is a demographic 
that creates a ‘halo’ effect attracting 
younger and older consumers. Our 
brand’s influence reaches beyond  
our core young audience, attracting 
older demographics with our  
performance-oriented and stylish 
products.

As other brands pivot towards 
inclusiveness, how does Under Armour 
maintain its competitive edge?
Under Armour is rooted in 
performance. We’re evolving to 
encompass ‘Sportstyle’ to meet the 
demand for versatile clothing suitable 
for athletic pursuits and everyday 
life. This strategy aligns with the 
global trend toward more casual 
attire, even in professional settings. 
We aim to capture a larger share of 
the consumer’s wardrobe by offering 
functional, stylish, and comfortable 
products for various occasions.

With the economic and geopolitical 
landscape in flux, what is Under 
Armour’s strategy for navigating the 
market as we approach 2024?
Earlier this year, we announced a new 
strategic focus we call Protect This 
House 3, which focuses Under Armour 
on three main objectives: driving global 
brand heat with an emphasis on the US; 
delivering elevated design and products 
with a focus on our footwear, sportstyle 
and womens businesses; and driving US 
sales while harnessing momentum in our 
international business.

Stephanie Linnartz is President and 
Chief Executive Officer at Under 
Armour. She is leading Under Armour 
through its next phase of growth 
centered on driving global brand 
heat, delivering elevated design and 
products, and growing sales.  

You are new to the sporting goods 
industry. What’s your perspective 
on the industry’s current state and 
trajectory into 2024?
In 2023, macro factors including 
geopolitical conflict, inflation, and 
consumer conservatism, as well as 
inventory challenges, have made for a 
bumpy year and required companies to 
allocate more resources to promotional 
activities. That said, we continue to 
manage things in our control to the best 
of our ability, and remain optimistic 
due to the enduring trend of fitness 
and health and our long-term growth 
potential, especially given our brand’s 
strong positioning. 

We have yet to provide color past our 
current fiscal year, which ends on 
March 31st. Still, it’s reasonable to 
anticipate continued conservatism as 
our sector finds the balance between 

supply-demand signals among brands, 
retailers, and consumers.

With casual and social sports 
gaining traction, how do you see this 
influencing consumer behavior?
According to the Sports & Fitness 
Industry Association – more Americans 
participated in at least one sport, 
fitness exercise, or outdoor recreation 
activity last year than in the five 
previous years. With post-pandemic 
increases in basketball, soccer, and flag 
football from a team sport perspective, 
consistent growth in running and gym 
workouts, and significant strength in 
golf, tennis, and pickleball – this is a 
great business to be in. 

The overall increase in sports 
participation and viewership continues 
to show strength and fosters a sense 
of community, which we see in the 
rising attendance at women’s sports 
events and a broader inclusivity in 
sports participation. For example, the 
NCAA women’s college basketball final 
between LSU and Iowa attracted over 
10 million viewers, making it the most-
watched women’s college basketball 
game in history.

“Inclusivity in sports is 
growing, complementing 
competitive athletics. The  
post-pandemic acceleration 
towards fitness and community 
brings more diverse groups 
into sports, including women 
and people of color.”

Amid this multiyear plan, we are working 
to strengthen our foundation, assess 
areas of the highest returns, and 
ultimately create a strategy capable 
of returning more consistent revenue 
growth and increased profitability for 
our shareholders over the long term. 
Most immediately, we are focused on 
hiring leadership talent, designing 
products, and ensuring our sourcing, 
manufacturing, and distribution are 
optimized for the highest returns. 

Although we have not provided our 
thoughts or color in 2024, our sector 
continues to work through a year-plus 
of elevated inventories and related 
promotions. Although inventory-to-
revenue spreads are coming more into 
alignment, we believe it will be a slow 
return to balance due to prolonged 
promotions from both the brand and 
retailer (wholesale) sides of  
the equation.

How has Under Armour managed to 
avoid the inventory issues that have 
plagued others in the industry?
Over the past year, the industry has had 
significant overstock, comparable to 
2015/16 levels, which took more than 
two years to normalize. Learning from 
this, our planning strategy is centered 
on aligning supply with demand as 
best as possible. We’ve invested 

substantially in data analysis and 
diversified our supply chain to ensure 
we have the right product at the right 
time. We’re also exploring advanced 
technologies like AI and machine 
learning to improve our forecasting 
capabilities further.

Our inventory health is a testament to 
our thoughtful approach to planning 
and management. This helped inform 
our decision to reduce our 2022 
order books by nearly $400 million, 
which has enabled us to stay more 
appropriately lean throughout 2023. 
Our advanced planning systems are the 
central nervous system of our business. 
We also have a diversified supply chain, 
which helps counterbalance various 
global dynamics that are constantly  
in play. 

Could you elaborate on the balance 
between DTC and wholesale 
channels for Under Armour?
Both channels are vital to our strategy. 
Consumers seek different shopping 
experiences, sometimes preferring a 
mono-brand environment and other 
times a multi-brand retail space. 
We’re enhancing our loyalty program, 
Under Armour Rewards, to deepen our 
customer relationships and provide a 
unique value proposition in the athletic 
performance space.

Digital engagement is a priority, 
particularly for connecting with the 
younger demographic, interacting 
with brands primarily through mobile 
and social media. We’re committed 
to delivering a seamless physical and 
digital brand experience. For this, we 
engage in consumer journey mapping 
to understand where the pain points lie 
and how to fix them.

Beyond selling products, how 
does Under Armour engage with 
consumers?
We aim to foster brand loyalty 
by engaging with consumers at 
every touchpoint. We offer unique 
experiences, like spending a day with 
one of our athlete endorsers, to create 
emotional connections. We strive to 
make our brand accessible and to 
exceed customer expectations in  
every interaction.

The industry needs to become more 
sustainable for the world and to meet 
its targets. How are you contributing 
to this?
Sustainability is integral to our 
business model and one of the top 
five values for Under Armour. We’re 
focused on creating products with less 
environmental impact and promoting 
circularity, such as encouraging 
customers to return used items. For 
this, our innovation capability center is 
a crucial asset where we, for example, 
have a whole effort around producing 
our clothing with fabric that sheds 
fewer fibers. 

This is an area where we want to lift 
all boats: if we or others develop more 
sustainable things, we should share 
them with the industry.

Our new corporate headquarters in 
Baltimore, which is set to open towards 
the end of 2024, will embody our 
commitment to sustainability, featuring 
green technologies and design, 
including solar power, geothermal 
temperature regulation, and recycled/
responsibly sourced materials. 
Sustainability is an ethically sound 
business choice equally important 
to our teammates, consumers, and 
shareholders.

As global temperatures continue to 
rise, policy makers worldwide are 
rolling out new regulation in support 
of sustainability. Legislation, such as 
the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 
and the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan, 
include language to unlock billions of 
dollars of financing for green energy 
and other solutions. China continues to 
pursue a 2030 target for wind and solar 
deployment, and ASEAN has published 
its sustainable finance taxonomy, 

aiming to promote sustainable 
activities and investments. In parallel to 
these initiatives, many sporting goods 
companies are working to raise the bar 
on their sustainability ambitions.

While most new sustainability rules 
will be applied across industries, some 
have a particular relevance for the 
sporting goods industry. A key element 
of the EU’s program, for example, will 
likely be the Ecodesign for Sustainable 
Products Regulation (ESPR), which 
will require companies to improve 
product recyclability, durability, and 
reusability, and will introduce a new 
digital product passport to offer better 
information to consumers.24 Meanwhile, 
under the Waste Framework Directive 
(WFD), producers will bear financial 
responsibility for collection, sorting, 
and end-of-life treatment of textiles 
– enforcing the so-called producer 
pays concept.25 In the US, New York 
lawmakers in 2023 proposed the New

Accountability Act. The Act will require

diligence, and disclose and reduce 
impacts.26 

In addition, regulators have passed 
a number of laws that promote 
transparency. In the EU, the Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) strengthens rules on the 
publication of social and environmental 
information. This has been reported to 
set a high bar for companies, at least in 
the short term. 

Against the background of an evolving 
regulatory agenda, many large sporting 
goods companies are making progress 
on their sustainability journeys. And in 
recent times, many smaller companies 
are also making efforts to cut their 
emissions, embed more sustainable 
processes, and address deficiencies 
in supply chains. Since 2018, there has 
been a significant rise in the number 
of companies setting science-based 
targets (SBTs), which provide a clearly 
defined pathway to lower greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions (Exhibit 10).27 

Away from SBTs, 81 percent of 
companies in the McKinsey & WFSGI 
Sporting Goods Industry Report Survey 
2023 have or are seriously considering 
CO2 targets28. Sixty seven percent 
say it is a priority, with many smaller 
companies lacking capabilities and 
resources (Exhibit 11). 

While slowing global warming is itself 
a vital undertaking, companies also 
recognize that action makes business 
sense. Research shows that consumers 
value products containing organic 
or sustainable materials, and they 
are willing to pay more for them.29 In 
particular, they value organic and 
sustainably sourced materials, while 
recyclable products and sustainable 
packaging are seen as less critical, our 
annual survey shows. 

Ten levers that can help accelerate 
progress
From cutting emissions to reducing 
waste and pollution, the sporting 
goods industry has many opportunities 

to improve its sustainability profile. 
Reflecting our numerous conversations 
with industry executives, we here 
gather ten ideas that offer companies 
potential paths forward:

1.  Promote consumer awareness 
and internal communication. 
Consumers may act more 
purposively if they are nudged in the 
form of incentives such as credits 
or points. In addition, product detail 
pages and better labels will help 
them understand more about the 
materials and processes involved 
in production. These can both be 
attached to products and placed 
in-store. Again, regulation will 
likely drive change, with the EU 
set to implement new labelling 
requirements under its Ecodesign 
Directive. For companies, one 
strategy could be to seek customer 
input, which can be instrumental 
in shaping the company’s 
sustainability strategy.

2.  Implement tracking, 

prioritization, and operational 
improvement. Effective tracking 
can enhance sustainability 
performance, helping companies 
identify and meet KPIs, for example, 
for emissions through the value 
chain. KPIs can also be applied to 
water use, waste, and renewable 
energy. Companies can define 
a baseline and then construct a 
reporting system for both internal 
and external stakeholders in line 
with reporting standards.

3.  Work toward end-to-end waste 
reduction. With more than  
70 percent of apparel ending up 
in landfills or incinerators, waste is 
a significant challenge.30 One way 
decision makers can tackle the 
challenge is by finding efficiencies 
in the production process. REI is 
among companies to have made 
progress, eliminating individual 
polybags for the majority of its 
private-label apparel items and 
recycling plastic wrapping.31 Where 
waste is inevitable, companies can 
take steps to sort it for recycling. 
They may also consider switching to 
low-waste approaches such as just-
in-time production or reusing waste 
to produce by-products. 

Downstream, customer information 
can drive behavior change. If 
businesses inform customers about 
packaging and product waste, they 
may see higher rates of return, 
particularly if they provide disposal 
points in-store or at retail partners. 

4.  Adopt green logistics. Companies 
could strive to optimize transport 
routes and networks, for example, 
by locating warehouses near 
hubs or optimizing truck fill rates. 
They could reduce the number of 
shipments per order, for example, 
through combined or “no-rush” 

shipments. In one example,  
GSI Outdoors repurposed about  
85 percent of in-bound shipping 
boxes to out-bound shipping 
boxes and recycled the rest.32 
For employees, companies may 
consider encouraging green 
transport to work and making 
business travel more sustainable. 

5.  Build green stores and 

warehouses. Buildings could 
be digitally monitored, with 
temperature, lights, and HVAC 
optimized. Lights can be switched 
to energy-efficient LED and 
turned off outside opening hours. 
Companies could save on energy 
bills by insulating buildings and 
electrifying tools such as forklifts, 
as seen at Mountain Equipment 
Company33. And they could reduce 
net emissions by switching to green 
energy providers and producing 
energy on-site where possible, for 
example, with solar panels.

6.  Embrace sustainable product 

design and assortment 
management. Product 
sustainability is largely set in the 
design phase. Companies could 
shift design practice by increasing 
use of circularity-friendly materials, 
minimizing packaging, and making 
packaging recyclable. Products 
could be designed to last and with 
repair in mind, while investment 
in advanced analytics could help 
customers make the right choice 
the first time, minimizing returns. In 
the production phase, companies 
are increasingly using eco-friendly 
dyes and finishes. Among the 
many industry examples, Allbirds 
in Spring 2024 is set to launch 
M0.0NSHOT, the world’s first  
net-zero carbon shoe.34 

7.  Adopt new business models. 
While cutting the emissions of 
existing business lines is one 

option, companies could consider 
going a step further by adding or 
subtracting entire business lines. 
Value adds might include sports 
and community events, training 
camps, or apps to support customer 
fitness regimes. To promote 
circularity, companies could offer 
repair and maintenance services. 
In core assortments, there is an 
opportunity to Iaunch subscription 
models or facilitate peer-to-peer 
rentals, for example, of sports 
equipment. Among companies 
taking a lead, Decathlon is offering 
subscription video fitness classes 
and corporate training programs.35 

8.  Adapt the product lifecycle. 

Companies could, where possible, 
design products for recycling, 
resale, and repair. In addition, it may 
be feasible in some product lines 
to introduce modularity, enabling 
replacement to boost product 
longevity. Companies could seek 
out materials such as recycled 
polyethylene terephthalate (rPET), 
which is typically made from plastic 
bottles.  

To involve customers in the 
process, companies may consider 
establishing customer-to-customer 
marketplaces for secondhand 
products, launching repair and 
reconditioning ‘labs’ in stores, 
or fostering brand-retailer 
collaborations to maximize repair 
and refurbishing. Arc’teryx’s 
ReBIRD™ Service Centers offer 
repairs, product assessments,  
and trade-ins, with technical 
washing facilities available at  
select locations.36  

Consumers may be more inclined 
to participate if they are offered 
benefits such as pick-up and 
shipping. In some cases, it may 
make sense to collaborate with

9.  Prioritize sustainable sourcing. 
Companies could try to secure 
a reliable supply of recycled 
materials, such as those made from 
green synthetic fibers. To conserve 
energy, manufacturing processes 
could be streamlined, with waste 
minimized and components reused 
whenever possible. Companies 
could work closely with suppliers to 
facilitate sustainability initiatives. 
Where suppliers are unable to meet 
requirements, they could consider 
switching to alternatives. In some 
cases, it may be possible to set 
criteria for suppliers at product and 
company levels—some companies 
are already doing so. Many use 
tools such as the Higg Index for 
value chain environmental  
impact analysis.

10. Embrace sustainable 

manufacturing. Companies may 
be able to make production more 
sustainable by reducing use 

of fossil-fuel energy. This may 
be achieved by reviewing and 
upgrading processes, improving 
monitoring and maintenance, or 
investing in new infrastructure/
pipelines. Nike Forward simplifies 
the process of material fabrication 
by reducing the number of process 
steps. This means less energy 
consumption, contributing to an 
average 75 percent reduction in  
its carbon footprint.37

In addition to creating more efficient 
processes, companies could switch 
to renewable energy and make 
changes such as training employees 
on conservation. Tools such as 
thermostats and sensor-switch lighting 
are simple ways to help companies 
and suppliers reduce energy usage. 
Away from energy, companies could 
aim to track and reduce water use, 
cut out harmful chemicals, and 
switch from wet to lower-emission 
dry processing. Finally, through 
nearshoring, companies could save 
on transportation-related emissions, 
as well as reduce lead times, cut risk 

exposure, and increase speed and 
flexibility.

Given the range of possible routes to 
sustainability, industry leaders are 
tasked in 2024 with continuing the 
process of turning ambition into action. 
For those at the start of the journey,  
a productive first step could be to 
define a marginal abatement curve 
(Exhibit 12). This will set out the ways 
in which the company could become 
more sustainable and associated costs. 
Many will likely make both business 
sense and reduce emissions, and 
companies may wish to prioritize these 
over those that incur costs.38

Individually and collectively, the levers 
on the abatement curve could move 
sporting companies toward greener 
and more sustainable business 
models (see a full set of levers for small 
companies in the Appendix). They could 
also encourage stakeholder buy-in 
and ensure all companies, large and 
small, have the information at hand to 
communicate effectively, inspire peers, 
and meet their wider stakeholder 
obligations.

John Sullivan is Senior Vice President 
of Marketing at WHOOP. A marketeer 
with 17 years of experience growing 
businesses and brands in the sports, 
health, and tech sectors, John leads 
the award-winning global marketing 
organization at WHOOP; the wearable 
health and fitness coach.

WHOOP is a wearable technology 
company. How do sporting goods 
brands that are historically focused 
on sports apparel and equipment 
engage with a company like yours, 
which operates at a different stage in 
the consumer journey?
It’s an interesting dynamic. Most major 
sportswear brands have experimented 
with wearables and, almost without 
exception, have moved away from them. 
For instance, Nike had the FuelBand 
but eventually exited that space. 
However, there’s growing interest 
among traditional sportswear and 
fitness brands in the connected fitness 
arena. A notable example is the recent 
partnership between Nike and Strava. 
This collaboration integrates Nike Run 
Club data into Strava and involves Nike 
trainers creating content for Strava 
users. Another example is Peloton and 
Lululemon, where Lululemon’s Mirror 
programming is now entirely provided 

52

by Peloton’s content studio. These 
partnerships indicate a shift. Instead of 
traditional brands trying to catch up in 
technology, they’re forming synergistic 
relationships with digital companies. 
This approach allows each to focus on 
their strengths: traditional brands on 
innovation in their core areas, like Nike 
with great shoes, and digital companies 
like WHOOP, Strava, and Peloton in 
their respective fields. The trend is 
moving away from attempting to create 
standalone digital solutions towards 
finding mutually beneficial collaborations.

Is there a notable difference 
in customer lifetime value 
between customers attracted 
by WHOOP’s ecosystem versus 
those who purchase the product 
independently?
Yes, there is a significant difference. 
Customers attracted through our 
ecosystem tend to engage with the 
app more frequently and for longer 
durations. They are more invested in 
their health and fitness ecosystem, 
which creates a sense of value that 
discourages them from leaving. They 
recognize the benefit of their data in 
making daily health decisions, which 
increases their likelihood of staying 
with us.

Considering the vast amount of data 
WHOOP has, it’s very valuable for 
potential partnerships with other 
companies. Could you elaborate on 
WHOOP’s ecosystem strategy and 
how you leverage these partnerships 
for mutual benefit?
Yes, absolutely. Our most common 
collaborations involve complementary 
brands across various sectors, such 
as connected fitness, supplements, 
mindfulness, and health monitoring. 
While not all brands have a direct 
WHOOP integration, most have apps 
that pair with Apple Health, allowing 
us to incorporate their data into the 
WHOOP app. We often find that 
these brands offer unique modalities 
to enhance recovery, fitness, health 
monitoring, and mental well-being. For 
example, we’ve integrated with nutrition 
apps like MyFitnessPal. Our approach 
begins with conducting ‘citizen science 
experiments’ to determine if there’s 
a significant correlation between 
WHOOP data and the partner’s 
intervention, like a sleep formula. If 
our data shows a positive impact, we 
engage in co-marketing and content 
creation within our app, aiming to 
engage users long term and exchange 
audiences interested in fitness, health, 
and wellness. The ecosystem is crucial 
as our members seek positive lifestyle 
changes. We recognize that other 
brands offer specific interventions that 
our users might already be utilizing. 
Therefore, we invite these brands 
into the WHOOP world to help users 
understand the effectiveness of these 
interventions relative to their goals.

Reflecting on this strategy, do 
you have a method to measure its 
effectiveness retrospectively?
Yes, we have a comprehensive 
scorecard to evaluate potential partners. 
This includes assessing brand fit, the 
size of the community we’re engaging 
with, and the mutual commitment to the 

Sporting Goods 2024 
“We cater to a wide range of personas with 
varying interests. For example, fitness enthusiasts 
might be more drawn to our strength training 
features, while other users, perhaps older, 
might focus on heart health indicators.”

partnership. While some integrations, 
like those with Apple Health, are 
straightforward, most partnerships 
require significant effort. We set high 
standards, considering factors like 
brand alignment and the size of the 
partner’s ecosystem. The effectiveness 
of a partnership is measured by the 
growth of our community through the 
partnership, the cost of acquiring these 
new members, and comparing their 
lifetime value to our existing members. 
Additionally, we assess if the integration 
enhances our existing offerings. For 
example, a nutrition app integration 
that improves macro tracking would 
be evaluated based on whether it 
increases the lifetime value of users who 
engage with this new feature. So, the 
effectiveness is gauged by community 
growth, acquisition costs, and the added 
value to our member’s experience.

When partnering with local 
figures, are you targeting specific 
demographics? 
We’re noticing significant developments 
at both ends of the age spectrum. 
Traditionally, we’ve focused on the 
25 to 45 age group, but there are two 
noteworthy trends now. On the younger 
side, platforms like TikTok, known for a 
younger audience, show high interest 
in health and fitness. This presents an 
ideal opportunity for us to spread our 
message through various creators in 
this space. On the other hand, health 
and fitness are increasingly associated 
with longevity, attracting more interest 
from the 40-plus demographic. This 
group is technologically adept and 
reachable, unlike previous generations 
at this age. They’re more focused on 
aspects like sleep, heart health, and 
weight management, aiming for a higher 

quality of life. With technology being 
more accessible to them, we see this 
as a growing market, keen on making 
lifestyle choices independent of primary 
healthcare, particularly in the US.

Have you noticed any differentiated 
demand for your services among 
these demographic groups? For 
instance, do older and younger users 
seek different features, and how 
does this influence your product 
development?
Definitely. We cater to a wide range of 
personas with varying interests. For 
example, fitness enthusiasts might be 
more drawn to our strength training 
features, while other users, perhaps 
older, might focus on heart health 
indicators. However, certain features, 
like sleep tracking, appeal universally, 
regardless of age or fitness focus. 
Sleep, being a significant but often 
unmonitored part of life, intrigues 
everyone. Additionally, our journaling 
feature, which correlates lifestyle 
choices with recovery and sleep metrics, 
is widely used. How users interact with 
this feature varies: fitness-oriented 
individuals might focus on exercise 
timing and environment, whereas 
health-focused users might track sleep 
consistency and heart rate metrics.

How do you ensure you’re capturing 
the latest customer trends and 
feature preferences?
We have extensive internal reporting 
on user engagement, time spent on the 
app, and the diversity of features used. 
We continuously study the relationship 
between engagement and customer 
lifetime value. Regular internal surveys 
within the app help us understand 
current user preferences and anticipate 
future needs. Although we conduct 

some focus groups and ethnographic 
research, much of our insight comes 
from frequent in-app surveys and 
citizen science projects, where we 
ask users about their activities and 
preferences beyond the app’s data.

You are growing a lot in the  
Middle East, why is that? 
The region is investing in tech-forward 
innovations from AI to healthcare and 
increasing investment in sports like 
golf, football, and paddle tennis. My 
experience suggests that sports are 
becoming more central to the region’s 
consciousness.

How has WHOOP capitalized on these 
growth trends in new markets? Is 
there a specific strategy for success?
Our strategies are similar across 
markets. We start by making 
our products available, ensuring 
competitive delivery rates and 
fulfillment costs. Supporting the 
product with necessary accessories 
and customer support is vital. In the 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), for 
instance, English fluency is high among 
our target demographic, reducing 
the need for local language support 
compared to markets like Germany. 
After ensuring product availability and 
support, we focus on localizing aspects 
like the app, content, and membership 
services, along with compliance and 
licensing. Once set up, we engage in 
platform marketing and collaborate 
with local personalities ranging from 
sports stars to fitness influencers. Our 
approach also includes associating 
with culturally significant events, such 
as fitness challenges in Dubai. The 
overall strategy isn’t vastly different 
from our approaches in  
Western Europe or North America.

With the help of digitally focused 
business models, many sporting 
goods companies have recalibrated 
their channel strategies, including 
establishing online offerings and 
ramping up direct-to-consumer 
services. But now change is afoot, with 
companies recognizing the potential for 
growth and engagement offered by the 
expanding ecosystem economy. 

Ecosystems are the end point on a 
journey that many sporting goods 
companies are already taking. With 
more options to choose from, for 
example, most large companies have 
moved away from channel-based 

distribution models and toward 
omnichannel propositions, aiming 
to serve customers at multiple 
touchpoints in parallel (Exhibit 13). 
About 70 percent of companies 
surveyed now operate in this way.39 
In 2023, leading brands went a step 
further, fine-tuning their strategies to 
reflect renewed consumer appetite 
for physical shopping experiences 
in the wake of the pandemic. These 
companies have refocused on 
wholesale relationships, seeking out 
partners they believe can best amplify 
their brand experiences. Rather

Companies cannot meet all of these 
needs alone. Instead, they can 
forge relationships with networks of 
companies that serve some element 
of the customer journey – from 
opportunity discovery, to planning 
and preparing, traveling, taking part, 
and recovery (Exhibit 14). McKinsey 
research shows that the activities 
within these steps that customers 
value most include finding similarly 
minded people, shaping products 
to their specific needs, obtaining 
insurance to reduce risks, liaising with 
travel agencies, and receiving support 
during activities. Ecosystems enable 
companies to cater to these demands.

Partnering can create value at 
distinct points in the value chain. For 
example, companies can cut the cost 
of acquisition. Moreover, customers 
that value holistic benefits are often 
the most avid sports enthusiasts, 
offering companies the chance to tap 
new sources of revenue. There are also 
tangential opportunities. Retailers, 
for instance, can set up media 
networks, enabling brands to purchase 
advertising on their digital platforms, 
while brands can engage in affiliate 
marketing.

e-commerce, this signifies a refinement 
of channel strategies to meet changing 
customer expectations.

Among companies to have taken steps, 
adidas has made a strategic shift - 
recalibrating its go-to-market strategy 
and reprioritizing wholesale, which 
accounts for 61 percent of sales.40 
PUMA, meanwhile, turned the big two’s 
temporary downgrade of physical retail 
to its advantage, selling more products 
at full price and building strong 
wholesale relationships, including with 
e-commerce platforms. It backed up 
these initiatives with exclusive product 
collaborations to attract Gen-Z and 
Gen Alpha. Its efforts helped the 
company achieve 22 percent wholesale 
growth from the third quarter of 2021 to 
third quarter of 2022.41

The ecosystem playbook
Beyond wholesale and digital, some 
sporting goods companies are going a 
step further in developing their channel 
strategies. In this case, the approach is 
predicated on a lens that focuses first 
on customer needs, including better 
health, better sleep, excellent nutrition, 
a healthier physical appearance, and 
a calmer, more purposeful state of 
mind; all increasingly associated with 
wellness and high performance.

Companies championing ecosystem 
strategies include the world’s biggest 
tech players, that have embraced 
business models that play into the 
major themes shaping consumer 
choices. Given the expanding 
financial opportunity, management 
team discussions on the potential of 
ecosystems will likely center on five  
key perspectives:42  

1.  Ecosystems are a reflection of 

both technology advancements 
and evolving customer needs. The 
future customer will increasingly 
look across sectors and value 
experiences on a single platform. 

2.  Sports consumers desire more 

than products. They also want to 
discover similarly minded people, 
personalize their experiences, and 
get access to helpful value adds 
such as insurance, sports agency 
services, and support during 
activities. 

3.   The idea of an outdoor sports 
ecosystem is appealing to 
customers. On average, about 
50-60 percent of European 
outdoor sport consumers would like 
an ecosystem to meet their needs, 

and the more they shop, the more 
they like the idea. About 90 percent 
of monthly shoppers and  
70 percent of people who shop 
every two to three months would 
use an ecosystem, McKinsey 
research shows (Exhibit 15).43 

4.   Ecosystems can create value 
for organizations through core 
business uplifts, for example, 
extending customer reach and 
lifting the number of touchpoints in 
specific segments. This, in turn, will 
drive cross-sell and up-sell. They 
can catalyze new revenue streams 
and foster valuation upsides 
through growth and/or tech 
multiples.

5.  Numerous sporting goods players 
have already embarked on the 
ecosystem journey. Among 
examples, Discovery Vitality has 
created a partner-enabled health 
and wellness loyalty ecosystem. 
Nike’s digital app ecosystem saw 
500 million visitors in the fourth 
quarter of 2022, and Strava has 
built a 100 million-plus community 
and is on the path to becoming 
the go-to destination for people 
seeking an active lifestyle.

Higher appeal 
to more 
frequent 
shoppers

Sporting Goods 2024 
“Customers attracted through our 
ecosystem tend to engage with the 
app more frequently and for longer 
durations. They are more invested in 
their health and fitness ecosystem, 
which creates a sense of value that 
discourages them from leaving.” 

— John Sullivan, Senior Vice President of Marketing, WHOOP

The most successful ecosystem 
strategies are predicated on a firm 
idea of target customers and buying 
behaviors. They tend to focus on 
frequent shoppers – the more than  
50 percent who purchase sporting 
goods every four to six months. 
Ecosystem players are also clear on 
the pain points they want to address. 
These often revolve around discovering 
opportunities, personalizing products, 
and preparing for and receiving 
support during activities. By offering 
products and services across industry 
boundaries, from retail to finance, 
entertainment, and travel, they aim 
to help customers overcome these 
challenges.

Making it stick: Five principles 
Successful ecosystem players focus 
on customer needs. But by doing 
so they can also create value, for 
example, through new subscription 
revenues, lower customer acquisition 
costs, and increased cross-selling 
opportunities. There is also a chance 
to earn commissions from third parties, 
and create operational efficiencies by 
sharing data, ideas, and technology. 
Still, our experience working with 
sporting goods companies shows the 
set up and development process can be 
complex. Indeed, many organizations 

fall short of reaching the impact they 
set out to achieve. To maximize the 
chances of success, five key principles 
are likely to make a difference:

•  Start simple. Settle on a strong 

anchor concept and aim to enhance 
at least one customer segment’s 
experience.

•  Undertake bottom-up, 

behavioral, and attitudinal 
segmentation. On that basis, 
identify a first move that reflects 
the business’s priorities. Work on 
segments rather than products,  
and don’t get overfocused on 
younger cohorts.

•  Get the buy and build balance 

right. Build where possible and be 
thoughtful about acquisitions.

•  Fail fast. The most successful 

companies embrace experimentation 
and continuous learning. They are 
happy to move on quickly when 
things don’t work out. It makes 
sense to prioritize areas of existing 
strength and take an iterative 
approach to roll out.

•  Don’t try to own everything –  
do it with partners. Leverage 
online sports communities or 
content providers for better reach.

On the final point, partnerships are 
by definition at the core of strong 
ecosystems. Successful ventures bring 
together partners that have a clear 
shared vision and are willing to invest 
in capabilities to get there. Leading 
companies have shown that productive 
partners generally fall under three 
umbrellas: those with complimentary 
product or service offerings that meet 
the needs discussed in this chapter, 
those that bring new customers to the 
table, and those than can enhance 
ecosystem capabilities to deliver on 
customer journeys.

In choosing partners, a structured 
approach tends to create the firmest 
bonds. This will mean first aligning on 
strategy. A commercial partner will 
bring a different playbook than one 
focused on capabilities, but businesses 
can benefit from seeking out common 
aims and values. The next step is to 
connect, before agreeing to the deal 
and integrating processes and talent 
over time. Forward-looking companies 
will also establish regular review 
processes, ensuring that partners 
remain aligned as the ecosystem grows 
and evolves.

Vanessa Garcia-Brito,  
Vice President and Chief Social and 
Community Impact Officer, Nike

why children might fall out of sports, 
and how we can mitigate these barriers 
as they grow. Our efforts span from 
championing women and girls in  
sports, focusing on inclusive products 
like sports bras and inclusive sizes,  
to innovations like period leak-proof 
shorts and FlyEase technology, 
enhancing accessibility for all 
athletes. These efforts stem from our 
commitment to regularly listen to and 
understand the athlete’s voice.

Shifting to older generations, we’re 
exploring opportunities for their 
participation in sports. Are older 
people becoming a more relevant 
customer group for Nike, especially 
with specific product technologies 
and targeted marketing?
Absolutely! We always keep all 
generations in mind. Even when 
our primary focus appears to be on 
youth and kids, it’s actually about 
the entire family unit. It’s fascinating 
how family dynamics play a role 
in sports participation – parents 
influencing children and vice versa. 
This intergenerational influence is a 
significant factor in how we approach 
sports engagement. Recently, I was 
discussing the concept of the ‘ageless 
athlete’ with a friend, which I find 
incredibly inspiring. It emphasizes 
that age is just a number and doesn’t 
define athletic potential. The human 
body experiences various peaks and 
limitations throughout life, and it’s like 
a roller coaster – you can reach your 
peak at any stage. (Personally, I’m 
aiming for my peak in my 80s – that’s 
my goal, to medal at that age. It’s a lofty 
ambition, but it’s what I aspire to!)

In line with this thinking, our product 
range at Nike isn’t just about catering 
to a specific age group; it’s more about 
accessibility. We want to ensure that 
whether someone is a jogger, walker, 

Vanessa Garcia-Brito is Vice President 
and Chief Social & Community Impact 
Officerat Nike. A lawyer by training, 
Vanessa began her career as an 
advocate for human rights with a 
focus on international and intellectual 
property law, and then continued her 
journey at Nike with highlights that 
include leading partnerships and 
strategic communications for the  
Girl Effect and creating Nike’s first-ever 
purpose communications.

We’ve noticed a trend towards more 
socially oriented and accessible 
sports, as opposed to highly 
organized or skill-intensive sports. 
Has Nike observed a similar trend?
At Nike, our core purpose is to move 
the world forward through the power of 
sport, which we interpret expansively. 
This includes not only traditional 
sports, but also play and all forms of 
bodily movement. We see life as a 
sport, whether it involves organized 
sports, individual activities, walking, 
or other forms of movement. The 
expansion of what ‘sport’ means is a 
positive trend. It’s more inclusive, which 
aligns with our philosophy. While trends 
evolve, some constants remain, such 

as the human desire for connection, 
fulfillment of potential, opportunities, 
and experiencing joy. We believe the 
more diverse the options available, the 
better. We’re also noticing a holistic 
approach to sports, considering not 
just physical aspects but also mental, 
spiritual, and wellness components.

In practical terms, how does this 
philosophy translate into Nike’s 
endorsements, advertisements, and 
brand focus?
Our focus revolves around the athlete’s 
voice, which is central to everything 
we do. We are continuously observing 
and responding to their needs and 
experiences, and this is evident across 
our spectrum of work, from community 
initiatives to the products we offer. 
For decades, we have emphasized 
the importance of youth sports and 
access to them. We’ve evolved our 
approach from simply providing access 
to designing movements like Made 
to Play, considering how the future of 
youth sports can be beneficial. Our 
learnings have highlighted specific 
challenges for girls in sports, leading 
to several adaptations in our approach. 
This includes addressing when and

marathon runner, or just looking to stay 
active, they find something in our range 
that suits their needs. 

You mentioned Nike’s expansion into 
wellness and adjacent areas to sports. 
Can you tell us more about the Nike 
Well Collective and its objectives?
The Nike Well Collective represents 
a consolidation of insights from our 
athletes, consumers, and broader 
societal trends, emphasizing the 
desire to live well. It’s about offering 
a holistic experience, acknowledging 
that physical activity alone isn’t 
sufficient. The Well Collective provides 
guidance on sleep, nutrition, and social 
connection, in addition to mental and 
spiritual wellness. It’s designed to 
offer multiple entry points, catering to 
individuals whether they’re drawn in 
by mental health, nutrition, or physical 
fitness, allowing for a personalized 
approach to wellness.

Previously, you mentioned 
ecosystem partnerships. How does 
this factor into your current strategy, 
especially in terms of supporting 
athletes and consumers beyond 
product sales?
Our ecosystem strategy continues to 
evolve. Alongside the Well Collective, 
we’re focusing on viewing our 
consumers and athletes holistically. 
Whether it’s about families, kids, 
performance-oriented individuals, or 
those focused on style and impact, 
we’re there in various capacities. 
This includes big sporting events and 
everyday community involvement 
through our Nike Community 
Ambassadors. These ambassadors 
volunteer as coaches and become 
role models in their neighborhoods. 
They are often seen as heroes by 
the youth they inspire and guide. Our 
partnerships extend to organizations 
like the Play Equity Fund and Laureus, 
focusing on localized sports initiatives 
and inclusive youth engagement.

Can you tell us more about these 
partnerships?
We collaborate with various partners 
like the Play Equity Fund in Los Angeles 
and our Made to Play neighborhoods 
program. This program focuses on 

hyperlocal initiatives in neighborhoods, 
co-designing programs that not 
only increase participation but also 
sustain and retain it, ensuring quality 
experiences. Another key partner is 
Laureus, with whom we work in different 
areas, focusing on building a positive and 
inclusive sports ecosystem and bringing 
youth into sports. We also engage with 
expert organizations like the Tucker 
Center for Research on Girls & Women in 
Sport. Together, we’ve created tools like 
Coaching HER, a guide tailored to the 
specific needs of girls in sports.

Can you describe how Nike’s sports 
programs are implemented? What 
does it typically involve?
Our approach is comprehensive. It 
begins with understanding specific 
community needs, whether it’s 
transportation, space, or security. 
We ensure alignment with partners 
who share our values and enhance 
their capacity to deliver meaningful 
programs. It’s about co-designing with 
stakeholders to create community 
programs, not just Nike programs. 
We consider appropriate age groups, 
inclusion, representation, and 
belonging principles. Coaching is vital; 
we adapt to different needs and local 
circumstances in each community and 
country. Our programs are designed to 

be frequent, supportive, and bring joy 
and fun, emphasizing connection and 
learning, not just winning. We actively 
seek feedback to respect and address 
community readiness and preferences.

How do you measure the benefits  
of your sports initiatives?
We use a range of metrics in 
collaboration with our partners. 
Participation is the starting point. We 
track inclusivity, aiming for consistent 
50% girls’ participation, by working 
with organizations to break down 
barriers. Understanding what fosters 
or hinders participation is key to our 
strategy.

What can other brands and readers 
of the report learn from Nike’s 
initiatives? How can they contribute 
to increasing physical activity?
I encourage others to join us in this 
endeavor. The key is to collectively 
ensure that sports are perceived 
positively by the youth, as a source of 
joy and fulfillment. Unfortunately, this  
isn’t always the current perception 
among young people. Changing this 
narrative requires a collaborative 
effort. We welcome others to join in this 
mission because it truly requires  
a collective approach.

“The key is to collectively
