companies, consumers, suppliers, and 
the overall EU economy.

 Ȼ Sustainability. The sector needs 

to play its part in decarbonizing the 
economy to meet the targets of the 
Paris Agreement on climate change. 
The value chain contributes about 
40 percent of overall EU greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions, less than 
5 percent directly from the sector’s 
own operations and about 95 percent 
from other activities up and down the 
value chain (for example, farming, 
manufacturing, and transportation).

 Ȼ Digitalization. Digital interactions 
are the norm and the doubling of 
the share of e-commerce (from 
15 to 30 percent by 2030) is 
expected to drive 90 percent of the 
sector’s growth. Eight hundred 
billion gigabytes of customer data 
were generated in 2021 across the 
world. Using this data for advanced 
analytics and artificial intelligence, 
together with the high potential for 
automation, will help companies 

maximize value creation and 
technological advances will make 
adoption easier.

 Ȼ Skills and talent. As the largest 

private-sector employer in the EU, 
the sector can drive upskilling and 
reskilling of the current workforce 
and improve employee productivity.

By transforming in these three areas, 
retailers and wholesalers will be able 
to increase their resilience, fulfill their 
social and environmental missions, 
and unlock new business opportunities 
beyond the traditional trade. They may 
attract and retain talent more easily, 
and their employees may benefit from 
more training and lifelong professional 
development. Consumers could benefit 
as well. The transformation could give 
them more choices and convenience, 
as well as enable them to take on more 
responsibility for the planet. Society 
across the EU and around the world 
could benefit as the sector curbs GHG 
emissions and helps protect the land, 
water, biodiversity, and health and 

The retail and wholesale 

industry is a key economic 
sector in the European 
Union (EU). It comprises 
nearly 5 million enterprises, 

about one-fifth of all companies 
registered in the EU. Retailers and 
wholesalers employ more people 
than any other private sector in the 
EU—about 26 million or 13 percent 
of the workforce. Collectively, these 
companies meet roughly one-third of 
total household consumption needs 
in the EU, generating annual revenue 
close to €7 trillion.1 The sector is in the 
midst of an accelerated transformation. 
Consumer demands are changing, and 
megatrends such as the growth of 
e-commerce, the need to decarbonize 
the economy, and an aging population 
pose threats to current business 
models—and provide opportunities 
for growth. To seize these and other 
opportunities, retailers and wholesalers 
must invest in three areas through 
2030: sustainability, digitalization, 
and, skills and talent. Bold moves in 
all three areas will bring benefits for

safety of communities. Overall, the triple 
transformation allows the sector to 
move toward more efficient, robust, and 
sustainable business models.

To make the triple transformation 
happen, retailers and wholesalers 
will have to increase their annual 
investments substantially. 

According to McKinsey modeling, 
companies across all retail and 
wholesale subsectors will need to invest 
an additional 0.8 to 1.6 percent of their 
revenues till 2030 on average. That 

equals an industry total of €315 billion if 
companies set themselves less ambitious 
targets (the conservative scenario) 
or €600 billion if the sector takes on 
more commitments (the ambitious 
scenario). SMEs account for about 
10 percent (€35 billion to €60 billion) 
of the total. That equals about one-
fourth of the sector’s EBITDA margin, 
a considerable share of revenues, in a 
low-margin industry. EBITDA margins 
are typically 4 to 6 percent in food retail 
and 4 to 10 percent in nonfood retail. The 
wholesale sector has even lower EBITDA 
margins.

INTRODUCTION

From a global perspective, European 
retailers and wholesalers invest less 
than other players in other regions, as 
shown in Exhibit 1.

The investment gap (3.6 percent in the 
EU compared to 6.7 percent in North 
America for large companies) could 
become a liability for European players 
as competition is increasingly global in 
the digital age.

INTRODUCTION

The retail and wholesale sector is important to 
the European Union—and it will have to invest  
to keep pace in a dynamic global market.”

Further challenges, such as the 
COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain 
disruptions, the war in Ukraine, record 
inflation, and soaring energy prices 
are causing many players to defer 
investments to protect profitability. 
In the current economy, increasing 
consumer prices to offset the cost 
of investments is widely considered 
difficult. Retailers and wholesalers 
therefore need to find ways to 
transform the sector in a way that 
balances short and long-term goals. 
Investing in energy efficient equipment, 
for example, can help reduce both GHG 
emissions and operating costs. 

While retailers and wholesalers 
can accomplish a lot on their own, 
collaboration across the value chain 
and external support will be key to 
accelerate the pace of the effort and 
ensure sufficient scale. If suitable 
support mechanisms and policy 
measures are put into place, retailers 
and wholesalers can make the 
necessary investments in sustainability, 
digitalization, and skills and talent and 
implement the required long-term 
changes.

THE TRIPLE  
TRANSFORMATION 
SURVEY

As part of this report, 
McKinsey and EuroCommerce 
surveyed 24 companies, 
including some of the 
largest retailers and 
wholesalers across the 
various subsectors in the 
EU. The survey gathered 
insights on the maturity level 
of companies across the 
three transformation areas— 
sustainability, digitalization, 
and skills and talent—as 
well as ambitions and future 
needs by 2030.

This report, prepared by McKinsey and 
EuroCommerce, in collaboration with 
EuroCommerce’s members, outlines 
the sector’s ambitions for 2030 on 
sustainability, digitalization, and skills 
and talent. It presents a consolidated 
view of the changes retailers and 
wholesalers could make, including 
investments that might facilitate the 
triple transformation. It also discusses 
the challenges the sector faces and the 
support it may need. 

The analyses and potential paths forward 
presented in this report are meant to 
address the needs of all five million 
of the EU’s registered enterprises, 
spanning all business models, most of 
the industry’s subsectors, and companies 
of all sizes, from large corporations to 
SMEs (from traditional mom-and-pop 
stores to franchisee stores). Less than 
1 percent of those companies are large, 
and most operate in one country only, 
or in a limited number of countries. All 
of the remaining companies are SMEs, 
only 8 percent of which have ten or 
more employees. That said, the required 
actions will differ, especially between 
larger and smaller players.

INTRODUCTION

SCENARIOS

Two scenarios were assessed to estimate the potential cost of the triple 
transformation for the EU retail and wholesale sector. In the more 
ambitious scenario, the total cost (cash-out) for retailers and wholesalers 
will come to €600 billion by 2030 (split into about €60 billion for SMEs 
and €540 billion for large companies). In a second, more conservative 
scenario with less ambitious targets, the total investment still amounts 
to €315 billion (split into €35 billion for SMEs and €280 billion for large 
companies). In either scenario, large companies stand to shoulder about 
90 percent of the total investment, while about 10 percent could fall to 
SMEs. The scenarios are detailed in the subsequent chapters.

The sector is competitive and growing 
slowly, especially in Western Europe, 
as markets are mature and population 
growth is stagnating. In most countries, 
retail and wholesale have been growing 
roughly in line with inflation. Growth 
rates in Central and Eastern Europe 
were slightly higher, due to rising 
purchasing power in those economies. 
With the high inflation rates across 
the EU and soaring energy prices, 
retailers are seeing declining volumes 
especially in the nonfood categories, 
as consumers’ disposable incomes are 
declining.

Helping all players transform will 
require a concerted effort from 
stakeholders—from farmers and 
primary manufacturers to suppliers, 
entrepreneurs, and educational 
institutions. In the right economic and 
regulatory environment, retailers and 
wholesalers could become a driving 
force for the entire European economy 
and help the EU achieve the objectives 
of the Green Deal, Digital Decade, 
European Skills Agenda, and other 
initiatives.

INTRODUCTION

FOCUS OF INVESTMENTS THROUGH 2030

Investments will be required in three 
areas (see Exhibit 2): 

 Ȼ The sustainability 

transformation. An ambitious 
investment of €335 billion, or a 
more conservative investment 
of €135 billion over eight years 
will help the sector move toward 
net-zero operations across 
its value chains, shift to more 
sustainable assortments within 
its range of private-label and 
branded products, and create 
more circular business models to 
reduce waste and costs as well 
as create new revenue streams. 
Retailers and wholesalers can 
help reduce Scope 3 emissions by 
making sustainable options easily 
accessible to consumers and 
providing transparency on GHG 

emissions and other aspects of 
sustainability. To move the needle 
on Scope 3 emissions, retailers 
and wholesalers can also work 
closely and in partnership with 
their supply-chain partners, 
including farmers.

 Ȼ The digital transformation. 
An ambitious investment 
of €230 billion, or a more 
conservative investment of 
€155 billion over eight years 
could enable the sector to evolve 
into a truly omnichannel industry 
that provides a seamless 
experience for customers, 
boosts automation across the 
value chain, scales up advanced 
analytics to drive growth and 
operational efficiency, and 
modernizes IT.

 Ȼ The skills and talent 

transformation. Retailers and 
wholesalers are already training 
some ten million people on 
the job every year.2 Further 
investments totaling €25 billion 
(conservative scenario) or 
€35 billion (ambitious scenario) 
will enable the other two 
transformations and help expand 
apprenticeship programs and 
implement the Pact for Skills. 
Smaller enterprises may take 
advantage of public programs 
and seek the support of the 
private sector to augment their 
investments in skills.

consumers, suppliers, 
and the EU overall.

Key takeaways
1. Investing up to €335 billion until 
2030 can prepare the sector for 
green growth. Key actions include 
net-zero operations, sustainable 
offerings, and circularity and 
waste management. 
2. If the sector takes the 
opportunity, it could reduce 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 
up to 90 percent by 2030. 
3. Working with their value chain 
partners, retailers and wholesalers 
can drive sustainability and 
Scope 3 decarbonization to 
improve resource efficiency, 
biodiversity, fair pay, and nudge 
consumers toward healthier, 

SUSTAINABILITY

emissions are a direct result of retail 
operations (Scopes 1 and 2), where the 
majority of emissions stem from vehicle 
fleets, refrigeration, and electricity 
purchased by retailers. More than 
95 percent of GHG emissions within 
the retail and wholesale value chain 
are Scope 3 emissions.2 These include 
upstream emissions that occur during 
the production of the goods sold by 
retailers and wholesalers, especially 
in primary production like agriculture, 
and downstream emissions that occur 
during the consumption and use of the 
sold goods. 

Beyond decarbonization, the sector 
also has a significant impact on other 
dimensions of sustainability. For 
example, the food, fashion, and furniture 
subsectors currently account for a 
large part of land use and therefore 
contribute to biodiversity loss, and the 
food, fashion, and consumer electronics 
subsectors contribute significantly 
to packaging and product waste 
generation. With a sizeable workforce 
directly employed in retail and 
wholesale and in the upstream value 
chain, the sector also has a significant 
impact on livelihoods.

The EU has set a target to cut 

GHG emissions by 55 percent 
by 2030 and reach net zero by 
2050. To achieve rapid change 
at scale and make a real 

difference in the fight against climate 
change, the sector would need to invest 
up to €335 if it is more ambitious, or 
€135 billion if it is more conservative, in 
three action areas: net-zero operations, 
sustainable offerings, and circularity and 
waste management.

SMEs would have to invest €10 billion 
to €25 billion. Large companies 
would have to invest €125 billion to 
€310 billion. This is equivalent to an 
incremental annual investment of 0.3 to 
0.9 percent of revenue. The sustainability 
transformation may prove to be an 
opportunity for the sector, as well as for 
consumers, suppliers who decide to act 
early on, and the EU overall.

European retailers and wholesalers 
and their value chains account directly

2. The transformation

There is growing pressure from all 
sides to accelerate the sustainability 
transformation in retail and wholesale— 
from consumers, investors, employees, 
regulators, and NGOs. NGOs have 
been increasingly outspoken when it 
comes to exposing what they see as 
wrongdoings and calling companies to 
account, while consumers increasingly 
demand sustainable options—either 
due to direct concerns about the effect 
of less-sustainable practices on their 
health or due to a growing awareness of 

the limited resources and vulnerability 
of the world they live in. According to 
the McKinsey Conscious Consumer 
Sentiment Survey,3 37 percent of 
European consumers care (deeply) 
about sustainability. Products that are 
marketed as sustainable outgrow the 
market average by a factor of three.4 

At the same time, more and more 
investors are adopting ESG criteria 
and channeling capital to sustainable 
companies. Sustainability also matters 
in the race for talent. Employers that are 
perceived as sustainable have a better 

chance of attracting, retaining, and 
inspiring purpose-driven people.5

On the regulatory front, the UN has 
adopted SDGs and the EU has set 
ambitious decarbonization goals. The 
later include reducing GHG emissions 
by 55 percent by 2030 (relative to 1990 
emission levels) and achieving net-zero 
GHG emissions by 2050 (see insert).6 
These targets are in line with the Paris 
Agreement, which seeks to limit global 
warming to well below 2 degrees, 
ideally 1.5 degrees (relative to 
preindustrial levels). It is expected that

SUSTAINABILITY

CARBON NEUTRALITY VERSUS NET ZERO

Carbon neutrality, is commonly used to refer to carbon dioxide 
(CO2) only and is often associated with the practice of offsetting 
emissions, rather than reducing them. In contrast, net zero is a more 
comprehensive, more ambitious standard. Net zero focuses on rapid, 
real emissions cuts of all GHG emissions (including, not only CO2, but 
also methane, nitrous oxide, and other GHGs). It requires companies 
to set quantified targets (for example, halving emissions by 2030) for 
their entire value chains, including indirect emissions (Scopes 1, 2, 
and 3). For details, see https://sciencebasedtargets.org/net-zero.

the sector will be required to ensure 
compliance with reduction targets both 
for direct (Scopes 1 and 2) and indirect 
(Scope 3) GHG emissions.7 

So far, 33 percent of the 50 leading 
European retailers and wholesalers 
have set science-based decarbonization 
targets. Of these, 75 percent have set 
Scope 1 and 2 reduction targets that are 
in line with or exceed the anticipated 
average EU target. Regarding Scope 3 
GHG emissions, there is more variance. 
At the time of writing, the Scope 3 
reduction targets adopted by Europe’s 
top 50 retailers and wholesalers 
range from 10 to 70 percent by 2030, 
with varying reference points.8 Even 
if retailers and wholesalers were to 
achieve net zero on Scopes 1 and 2, 
the Scope 3 targets set by retailers 
and wholesalers so far will not be 
sufficient to reach the overall 55 percent 

reduction target of the EU. Retailers and 
wholesalers need to take more decisive 
action on decarbonization, and increase 
their collaboration with other players in 
the ecosystem, especially suppliers.

While decarbonization is a significant 
and pressing challenge, it is only 
one aspect of sustainability. Other 
benefits of sustainable practices 
include improved resource efficiency, 
biodiversity, livelihoods, and health (see 
box “Multiple facets of sustainability”). 
Many retailers and wholesalers 
are already pursuing projects and 
initiatives to address these aspects. 
That said, new regulations regarding 
biodiversity, worker livelihoods, and 
healthy food products will likely be 
introduced into Europe soon. These 
include regulation on deforestation-
free products and requirements for 
sustainability due diligence.9

Retailers and wholesalers hold a unique 
position in their value chains as the link 
between producers and consumers. 
This position gives them the opportunity 
to advance their sector’s sustainability. 
Retailers are well positioned to nudge 
consumers to consider more sustainable 
options, help increase transparency and 
coordination along the value chain, and 
make producers aware of the importance 
of a holistic sustainability transformation. 
In response to growing consumer 
demand, many retailers are already 
making more shelf space available for 
sustainable options.10 They are in the 
driver’s seat and do not have to wait 
for suppliers or other players to drive 
assortment sustainability. This is because 
many retailers control a large range of 
private-label products. Of course this is 
more limited for SMEs.

The sustainability transformation 
is an opportunity for retailers to 
differentiate their assortments, tap 
into growing green value pools, and 
develop new circular business models. 
In many cases, emissions reduction 
brings cost savings or new revenue 
streams. It is time for retailers and 
wholesalers to follow the example 
of the green pioneers in their midst 
and switch from playing defence (risk 
mitigation) to playing offense (value 
creation). If they act fast and decisively, 
retailers and wholesalers will be 
able to best combine what’s good for 
the planet with what’s good for their 
businesses. The transformation could 
be significantly accelerated through 
harmonized standards across the value 
chain and simplified rules. This would 
support not only the European retail 
and wholesale sector in its efforts to 
promote sustainability in the value 
chain but also the sustainability of the 
European economy as a whole.

SUSTAINABILITY

Potential developments  
by 2030
If the sector takes the opportunity to 
drive the sustainability transformation, 
it could reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions by up to 90 percent by 
2030, be a driving force for Scope 3 
decarbonization, and improve 
circularity, efforts to promote 
biodiversity, and resource efficiency 
(for example, by increasing the plastic 
recycling rate to 70 percent). The sector 
could also continue to play an active 
role in nudging consumers to change 
their behaviors by providing clear 
information, expanding sustainable 
options, and advising them on 
sustainable consumption. If these 
efforts come to fruition, retailers and 
wholesalers receive the right support, 
and engage in cross-value-chain 
collaboration, the sector can help to 
advance the wider EU sustainability 
agenda substantially, far beyond its 
own operations.

If they act fast 
and decisively, 
retailers and

will be able to 
best combine 
what’s good for 
the planet with 
what’s good for 
their business.”

SUSTAINABILITY

Given that 99 percent of retail and 
wholesale consists of SMEs, the sector 
should make a joint effort to provide 
SMEs with the information, practical 
know-how, and support they need to 
play an active role in the sustainability 
transformation. Trade associations 
are well placed to support their SME 
members in their efforts to manage 
change.

3. Actions for consideration

Retailers, wholesalers, and their 
partners can pull many levers to 
advance and promote sustainability 
in their value chains. These levers 
can be grouped into three action 
areas (Exhibit 2): net-zero operations, 
sustainable offerings, and circularity 
and waste management. Taking decisive 
action in these areas can bring multiple 
benefits for the entire sector: compliance 
with future regulations, increased cost 
efficiency, reduced negative impact of 
any potential carbon tax introduced, 
lessened impact of overall energy 
price volatility, improved supply-chain 
resilience, competitive differentiation 
for first movers who satisfy customers’ 
growing demand for sustainable choices, 
and the opportunity to make the sector 

more attractive for job seekers. Many 
levers require investment from retailers 
and wholesalers. Others will likely be 
cost neutral but necessitate commercial 
or operational changes. And, while 
many levers are under the direct control 
of retailers and wholesalers, others 
require collaboration with upstream and 
downstream value-chain partners. Other 
influential players in the value chain, 
such as manufacturers and farmers, also 
need to act.

More generally, there are some 
structural factors that might inhibit or 
delay the implementation of certain 
changes, including scarcity of relevant 
technology, overregulation, difficulties 
with financing, a lack of infrastructure, 
and insufficient consumer education 
about sustainability. The more 
stakeholders cooperate across national 
borders on these factors, the faster 
and more effective the transition to a 
sustainable sector will be.

It is estimated that the sector needs 
to invest a total additional €135 billion 
to €335 billion (cash-out) for the 
sustainability transformation by 2030, 
equivalent to 0.3 to 0.9 percent of 
revenue.

SCENARIOS

Two different scenarios were 
assessed to estimate the 
potential cost of the sustainability 
transformation for the EU retail and 
wholesale sector. In the first, more 
conservative scenario, EU retail 
and wholesale achieve the required 
reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
by 2030 on average, but do not take a 
more active role in the sustainability 
transformation. In the second, 
significantly more ambitious scenario, 
EU retail and wholesale play a 
leading role in the sustainability 
transformation and contribute to the 

EU sustainability agenda as outlined 
above. Specifically, the scenarios are 
based on the following assumptions:

 Ȼ Conservative. Assumes a focus 
on a 55 percent reduction of 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with 
limited efforts to reduce Scope 3 
emissions.

 Ȼ Ambitious. Assumes the sector 
targets reducing Scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 80 to 90 percent 
(exceeding expected Green Deal 
requirements), with bold efforts 
to substantially reduce Scope 3 
emissions.

Net-zero operations
Net-zero operations is the action area 
that is under the direct control of 
retailers and wholesalers. Net-zero 
operations is made up of four topics: 
renewable energy, net-zero stores 
and warehouses, net-zero fleets, 
and sustainable manufacturing (for 
vertically integrated retailers and 
wholesalers). 

Addressing these topics can help 
reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. 
Although these emissions represent 
less than 5 percent of the total GHG 
emissions attributable to the sector, 
both large companies and SMEs need 
to adopt net-zero operations to achieve 
their Scope 1 and 2 decarbonization 
targets and advance the sustainability 
of the ecosystem as a whole. At a cost 

of €120 billion to €300 billion, net-zero 
operations could enable retailers and 
wholesalers to reduce Scope 1 and 
2 GHG emissions by 50 to 90 percent 
by 2030. Given the vast number of 
trucks, stores, and distribution centers, 
optimizing operations is likely to be 
the costliest task for retailers and 
wholesalers. In every neighborhood in 
every town, there is probably a store 
that could be optimized. However, while 
making operational changes would 
require substantial investment, most 
levers have a positive net present value 
(NPV) or are at least NPV neutral. This 
is why most retailers and wholesalers 
will likely want to decisively 
decarbonize their own operations 
beyond what some are already doing.

Renewable energy
Energy—in terms of electricity and 
heat—is a topic that cuts across 
all operational topics, from stores 
and warehouses to fleets and 
manufacturing. Retailers can improve 
the energy efficiency of their operations 
and switch to renewable sources 
where available, thereby helping the 
EU drive the transition to green energy. 
Specifically, they could use existing 
assets to produce renewable energy. 
Those who own stores and warehouses 
could install solar panels on the roofs to 
generate electricity, either for their own 
operations or for shoppers to charge 
electric vehicles (EVs) in the parking lot 
or as a new source of revenues; in some 
countries, the installation of a certain 
number of charging stations is already 
required by regulation.

SUSTAINABILITY

Switching to green energy providers 
may be difficult because some EU 
countries still rely primarily on 
nonrenewable energy sources, such 
as coal. For retailers operating in 
these countries, self-generation of 
renewable energy (including heat) with 
solar panels and heat pumps may be 
especially important, both to promote 
energy independence and reduce their 
carbon footprints; in today’s times of 
soaring energy prices, it might also be 
an economic imperative. 

Retailers and wholesalers can leverage, 
for example, virtual Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs) to aggregate 
virtually the load of a lot of small 
suppliers and drive scope 3 reduction 
this way. An American retailer has 
been the first company in the world to 
launch such programs. Net-zero energy 
is relevant to the next three topics, and 
the cost of adoption is reflected there. 

Net-zero stores and warehouses
In the food subsector, the main drivers 
of store GHG emissions are refrigeration 
and lighting. In the nonfood subsector, 
the main drivers of store GHG emissions 
are lighting, heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning. At a cost of €20 billion to 

€50 billion, decarbonizing existing stores 
could reduce Scope 2 GHG emissions 
by 30 to 50 percent. At the same time, 
it may also help reduce Scope 1 GHG 
hydrofluorocarbon emissions from old 
cooling appliances. 

Some retailers already apply digital 
solutions, like building management 
software (BMS) and remote digital 
management, to optimize and control 
energy consumption in their stores. 
Comparing store consumption remotely 
by looking at load profiles can help 
detect anomalies. Initiatives targeting 
lighting, refrigeration (if applicable), 
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, 
for example, could help reduce energy 
consumption to best-in-class levels 
(30 to 50 percent below the current EU 
average).

At a cost of €50 billion to €140 billion, 
decarbonizing warehouses would 
address 20 to 40 percent of Scope 2 
GHG emissions and potentially 
some Scope 3 GHG emissions, from 
warehouses owned and operated by 
third parties. Decarbonizing warehouses 
may also help reduce some Scope 1 
hydrofluorocarbon emissions from old 
cooling appliances.

While making 
operational 
changes would 
require substantial 
investment, most 
levers have a 
positive net present 
value (NPV) or 
are at least NPV 
neutral.”

If retailers and wholesalers build or 
encourage new stores and warehouses 
to be built in a way that minimizes GHG 
emissions (net-zero), further reductions 
could be achieved. An important lever 
to achieve warehouse decarbonization 
could be to reduce energy consumption 
to a level that is 20 to 60 percent below 
the current average energy consumption 
of existing warehouses. However, 
reducing energy consumption alone may 
not enable retailers and wholesalers to 
meet net-zero targets for their stores 
and warehouses. This makes switching 
to green energy providers where 
available or generating green energy 
themselves also important (see section 
on renewable energy above). The cost 
estimates above are adjusted to include 
an allowance for companies to self-
produce green energy.

Net-zero fleets
At a cost of €30 billion to €70 billion, 
decarbonizing fleets (both owned and 
outsourced) could reduce Scope 1 GHG 

emissions by 70 to 90 percent (own 
fleets), as well as substantially reduce 
Scope 3 GHG emissions (outsourced 
fleets).

The most important fleet 
decarbonization lever is to substitute 
vehicles with lower-GHG alternatives, 
such as EVs. Retailers and wholesalers 
that switch to EVs in their own fleets 
will also need to install charging 
infrastructure in their fleet depots. This 
will likely add another €20 billion to 
€40 billion to the required investment 
(including the cost of charging 
infrastructure for consumer EVs in 
parking lots). 

The decarbonization of fleets will be 
multiphased, as different technologies 
will achieve total cost of ownership 
parity with internal combustion engines 
at different points in time. Initially, 
retailers and wholesalers may explore 
options and try different solutions, 
including electrical, hydrogen-fueled, 

SUSTAINABILITY

or liquid-biogas vehicles (if and 
where the infrastructure for EVs or 
hydrogen-fueled vehicles is not yet 
available) to gain hands-on experience. 
For short-haul delivery, especially for 
the last mile, they can quickly adopt 
EVs. In some urban areas, delivery by 
(electric) cargo bikes could also be a 
viable solution, provided safe bike lanes 
are available. For longer distances, 
companies may rely on liquid biogas 
until EVs and hydrogen-fueled trucks 
have the requisite capacity and reached 
a more competitive price point. 

Other fleet-related levers include 
optimizing routing to reduce total 
and empty mileage, optimizing truck 
fill rates, optimizing the distribution 
center network for sustainability 
while balancing for cost (as well as 
e-commerce growth), and setting 
decarbonization criteria for providers of 
third-party logistics. With all that said, 
achieving net-zero logistics may take 
some time.

SUSTAINABILITY

In effect, retailers may help to accelerate the 
transformation of the entire value chain and 
fulfill the larger EU sustainability agenda.”

Sustainable manufacturing  
(for vertically integrated retailers  
and wholesalers)
Some retailers and wholesalers 
also produce some or all of the 
goods they sell. These players can 
reduce the environmental footprint 
of manufacturing—both in food 
and nonfood (for example, apparel, 
sports, and personal care). They can 
achieve this by switching to green 
energy sources, self-generating 
energy at production sites, reducing 
water consumption, optimizing 
product design, and revising sourcing 
strategies. While many of these 
levers contribute to decarbonization, 
sustainable manufacturing may 
also bring improvements in other 
sustainability dimensions, such as 
resource efficiency, biodiversity, 
livelihoods, and health. Getting 
more involved in the sustainability 
transformation of manufacturing may 
also make it easier for retailers to 
lead the way for consumer packaged 
goods (CPG) companies and promote 
collaboration across the value chain.

According to a McKinsey analysis, 
dozens of levers can be applied in 
this area. As an example, platforms, 
such as McKinsey’s RedE (Resource 
Efficiency Deployment Engine), can help 
companies identify, rank, implement, 
and track opportunities to improve the 
energy efficiency of manufacturing, 
from parameter adjustment to 
refurbishment or replacement of 
equipment.11  

Sustainable offering
Providing a more sustainable offering 
for consumers can help retailers and 
wholesalers move the needle on Scope 
3 GHG emissions and other aspects 
of sustainability, such as biodiversity, 
livelihoods, and human health, and 
help them support the EU sustainability 
agenda. This is because the demand for 
sustainable options is growing across 
countries and generations.12 If retailers 
and wholesalers put more sustainable 
products on their shelves, give them 
more prominence in stores, and provide 
consumers with clear, transparent 
information about sustainability, 
consumers will buy more sustainable 
products. Before long, this increase 
in demand could lead to an increase 
in supply by manufacturers and 
producers. In effect, retailers may help 
accelerate the transformation of the 
entire value chain and fulfill the larger 
EU sustainability agenda.

Creating a sustainable offering may 
not require substantial investments by 
retailers and wholesalers, at least not 
in terms of capital expenditure (capex). 
Rather, it is about collaborating with 
their suppliers and primary producers 
to review the assortment, including 
private-label and branded products 
sourced from CPG companies; adapt 
processes; and train employees. As this 
process will require time, retailers and 
wholesalers would benefit from starting 
as soon as possible. A sustainable 
offering will also help retailers and 
wholesalers meet extended producer 
responsibility requirements.13

Private-label products
Private-label products present an 
immediate opportunity because 
retailers are directly responsible for 
specifications. Potential levers include:

 Ȼ Sustainable design. Product 

developers can design private-
label products with lower GHG 
and biodiversity impact, healthier 
ingredients, less packaging, and a 
focus on increased reusability or 
recyclability.

 Ȼ Sustainable sourcing. Procurement 

managers can set holistic 
sustainability criteria for suppliers 
of pre-products, components, and 
ingredients, both on a company 
level (for example, for net-zero, 
resource efficiency, biodiversity, 
livelihood, and health goals) and 
on a product level (for example, 
sourcing products with lower GHG 
and biodiversity impact, more 
sustainable packaging, and more 
nutritious ingredients). Retailers 
and wholesalers may prefer 
producers who have already set 
clear sustainability targets or 
implemented production practices 
with sustainability benefits, such as 
regeneratively produced products.

SUSTAINABILITY

REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE

A sustainable offering depends on 
sustainable production practices, 
especially in subsectors in which 
production-related emissions make 
up the largest share of emissions 
(such as in food, apparel, furniture, 
and personal care). Since most 
production-related GHG emissions 
are connected to the farming stage of 
the value chain, agricultural practices 
like regenerative agriculture (RA) 
can help to advance the sector’s 
sustainability transformation. RA 
refers to a set of farming practices 
that aim to maximize soil health 
and enhance natural resources 
through minimal soil disturbance 
(for example, through low- or no-till 
farming), crop rotation, permanent 
soil cover, agroforestry, and 
integration of livestock systems 
(such as rotational grazing).

The key benefits of RA include lower 
GHG emissions, increased soil health, 
better biodiversity outcomes (such 
as increased pollinator populations 
and reduced pest and disease 

pressure), and more efficient use of 
water and nutrients. Initial studies 
also indicate that crops from farms 
that follow RA practices have a 
healthier nutritional profile than the 
same crops grown on conventional 
farms.14 Additionally, RA reduces the 
dependency on agricultural inputs, 
such as fertilizers,15 and produces 
more stable yields through better 
resilience to droughts and floods.16 
Last but not least, RA has a high 
profit potential that is connected to 
income from carbon credits, cost 
savings, and additional revenue 
streams.

One of the key challenges of RA is 
its potentially lower yield (compared 
to conventional agriculture). That 
said, some studies show that a yield 
increase of up to 20 percent could be 
achieved within a five-year period, for 
example, through no-till practices. 
Another challenge is the fact that the 
benefits of investing in the transition 
from conventional to RA practices 
will only manifest after three to five 

years, which requires farmers to 
take a mid-term perspective. There 
also are no clear guidelines on what 
RA should entail. Finally, consumer 
awareness is virtually nonexistent 
so far because there are no widely 
known labels that communicate RA 
benefits to consumers, and because 
soil health is not a priority for most 
consumers.

Retailers and wholesalers can help 
overcome the current challenges 
associated with RA and thus 
accelerate the transition toward more 
sustainable production practices. 
For example, they can increase the 
share of products they source from 
regenerative sources, motivate the 
sector to set clear guidelines on 
RA in a joint effort, and support the 
communication of RA benefits to 
consumers.

To advance the sustainability 
transformation of private-label products 
effectively and efficiently, a clear 
understanding of GHG emissions and 
other sustainability-related effects 
and levers at the product level may 
be required. Marginal abatement cost 
curves (MACC), for example, can help 
determine the impact and cost of different 
decarbonization levers (Exhibit 4).

Branded products
For branded products sourced from 
CPGs or smaller suppliers, category 
managers may want to increase the 
share of products with a low GHG and 
biodiversity impact, healthy ingredients, 
and sustainable packaging. To make 

this happen, they can set respective 
targets for their suppliers. Unlike major 
CPG corporations, smaller suppliers 
may need support in their efforts to 
adopt sustainable practices, through 
capability-building workshops or 
analytical support, among other things. 
Retailers could even build product-
level MACCs and share these with 
SME suppliers. This will enable SMEs 
to prioritize decarbonization initiatives 
in a way that maximizes sustainability 
impact while minimizing cost. In 
addition, these MACCs could provide 
a fact base for discussions between 
retailers and suppliers regarding trade-
off decisions about decarbonization 
initiatives.

Some companies have already 
started setting goals for the 
shift toward a more plant-based 
assortment. One leading European 
retailer aspires to derive 60 percent 
of all protein in its assortment from 
plants by 2030. When contemplating 
such initiatives, retailers may benefit 
from considering the needs of all 
stakeholders. Farmers, for example, 
may need support to shift to more 
plant-based production systems.

SUSTAINABLE OFFERING 
IN GROCERY

Grocery is a subsector of retail that 
brings a wealth of opportunities to 
advance sustainability. Grocers are in a 
unique position to drive improvements 
beyond what they are already doing 
to meet EU targets. Specifically, 
supporting consumers in the transition 
to diets with higher shares of plant-
based foods could bring multiple 
benefits, including:

 Ȼ Lower GHG emissions. For 

example, substituting 100 grams 
of beef with 100 grams of a 

plant-based alternative can lead 
to a 90 percent reduction of GHG 
emissions (see also Exhibit 5).17

 Ȼ Reduced deforestation and 

biodiversity loss. A recent study 
suggests that substituting 20 
percent of global beef and veal 
consumption with lower-impact 
alternative proteins could halve 
deforestation.18 

 Ȼ Promotion of human health. A

Circularity and  
waste management
Today’s predominant linear economic 
model has not yet been optimized 
to reduce waste. From a planetary 
perspective, linear models take 
more than they give back. To set the 
retail and wholesale sector up for 
long-term sustainability and satisfy 
consumer demand for sustainable 
solutions, retailers and wholesalers 
will need to move from linear business 
models (“use and dispose”) to circular 
business models (“reuse or recycle”) 
and reduce waste along their entire 
value chains. Although this paradigm 
shift does not solely depend on 
retailers and wholesalers, they can 
play a key role in driving change. At 
the same time, circularity and waste 
management is also an important 
value-creation opportunity for retailers 
and wholesalers. Potential benefits 
include incremental revenues from 
new business models (such as rental, 
refurbishment, or resale), cost savings 
through waste reduction, and improved 
long-term relationships with customers. 

Circularity can also reduce GHG 
emissions because it reduces the 
need for virgin material extraction and 
processing required to keep products 
in use. The subsequent GHG emissions 
reduction offsets the GHG footprints 
of any actions that may be required 
to keep products in use. This theme 
is comprised of three topics: circular 
packaging, circular products, and end-to-
end waste reduction.

Circular packaging
At a cost of €5 billion to €15 billion, 
shifting from current linear systems to 
more circular systems for plastic-based 
packaging20 (both rigid and flexible) will 
help retailers and wholesalers reduce 
the use of virgin materials. Potential 
levers include:

 Ȼ Increasing the share of circular 

input material for plastic packaging 
(such as recycled or bio-based 
plastics).

 Ȼ Offering more circular packaging 
models (for example, refilling 
multiuse plastic containers for 
products sold in bulk). While 
the effect of this lever could be 
substantial, it likely requires a 

fundamental rethinking of current 
processes. Also, consumer 
acceptance of circular packaging is 
still low in some countries.

their stores.

 Ȼ Establishing additional infrastructure 

for the collection, sorting, and 
recycling of plastic waste to 
achieve higher rates of closed-loop 
recycling (such as using old bottles 
to make new bottles).

While the first two levers are relevant 
for all retailers and wholesalers, the 
third lever could be especially relevant 
for large retailers and wholesalers 
controlling the end of life of packaging. 
Collecting and recycling packaging 
could give them access to low-cost input 
materials for recycled packaging. How 
collecting and recycling infrastructure 
is installed on the premises of retailers 
and wholesalers is still subject to 
ongoing discussions, particularly to 
determine whether these are public 
or public–private partnerships. 
Some retailers have already 

A few countries, such as Germany, 
have already implemented some of the 
measures described above, such as 
waste collection and recycling, while 
others, such as circular packaging, still 
await adoption at scale.

Circular products
At a cost of €10 billion to €20 billion, 
shifting from the current linear 
systems to more circular systems for 
nonconsumable products (such as 
fashion, consumer electronics, and 
furniture) could significantly reduce 
the need for virgin materials (plastics, 
wood, and metals) and help reduce 
GHG emissions. Potential levers 
include:

 Ȼ Increasing the share of circular

 Ȼ Increasing the offering of circular 
product models, such as renting 
out products, which may include 
new business models around 
repair shops and refurbishing, 
remanufacturing, and selling 
secondhand products. While the 
impact of new models such as 
these could be substantial, it would 
also require rethinking current 
processes.

 Ȼ Establishing additional 

infrastructure for the collection, 
sorting, reuse, and recycling of 
products at the end of use to 
achieve higher rates of closed-loop 
recycling (for example, by using old 
furniture to make new furniture).

While the first two levers are relevant 
for all retailers and wholesalers, the 
third lever could be especially relevant 
for vertically integrated players, 
such as furniture retailers that also 
produce furniture, or apparel retailers 
that manufacture their own clothing. 
Collecting used products could give 
them access to low-cost materials 
for reuse or recycling. While some 

players may choose to collect used 
products on their premises, others may 
choose to do it elsewhere or rely on 
public infrastructure. Some retailers in 
apparel have already started to collect 
and recycle or upcycle used products 
on their shop floors.

 Ȼ Reducing upstream waste. 

This could be accomplished by 
encouraging suppliers to improve 
production and processing 
technology, improving supply-chain 
infrastructure, and maximizing 
product utilization.

A detailed view on the circularity 
potential in the textile industry can be 
found in McKinsey’s most recent report 
Scaling textile recycling in Europe—
turning waste into value.

End-to-end waste reduction
Reducing packaging and product waste 
is key to reducing GHG emissions in the 
value chain, but it will likely not require 
much investment from retailers and 
wholesalers. In fact, reducing waste 
may have a positive financial impact 
because it helps reduce the cost of 
goods sold. That said, retailers and 
wholesalers may need to adapt their 
processes to include sustainability 
criteria and train their employees on 
sustainability topics to promote waste 
reduction. Potential levers include:

 Ȼ Reducing waste in retailer’s and 

wholesaler’s operations. Retailers 
and wholesalers could reduce 
waste by improving demand 
forecasting, adapting procurement, 
and better utilizing waste streams.

 Ȼ Reducing downstream waste. 
Downstream waste could be 
reduced by increasing the shelf 
life of fresh products, educating 
consumers on “use by” and “best 
before” dates, allowing consumers 
to buy exactly the weight or volume 
they need, and increasing the 
collection and reuse or recycling of 
waste at the end of use.

 Ȼ Uncertainty about who will fund 

Scope 3 decarbonization initiatives. 
For example, suppliers may need 
to reduce GHG emissions for new 
production facilities.

 Ȼ Lack of harmonized standards, 
methodologies, and labels to 
measure, track, and communicate 
sustainability impacts. An issue 
on the product and company 
level, especially at the level 
of individual products and 
beyond decarbonization metrics, 
contributing to consumers’ doubt 
about greenwashing.

 Ȼ Higher sourcing prices of 
sustainable products and 
packaging. For example, the market 
is experiencing a price premium 
with recycled PET versus virgin 
PET due to the current imbalance of 
supply and demand.

Other barriers include a lack of 
renewable energy in some EU 
countries, lack of know-how on 
sustainability topics, technological 
limitations (such as the limited range of 
EVs and fuel-cell trucks, or insufficient 
charging and fueling infrastructure), 
and varying degrees of consumer 
awareness and willingness to change 
behavior across subsectors and 
countries.

For smaller players (SMEs), many of 
these roadblocks are even bigger than 
for major corporations. SMEs often lack 
the expertise and resources to drive 
sustainability, and may not have the 
scale to achieve the discounts required 
to make investment in sustainability 
financially viable or manage the 
administrative burden. 

A number of potential solutions 
could help clear existing roadblocks 
and accelerate the sustainability 
transformation of the sector. In 
the following section, we present 
suggestions articulated by retailers 
and wholesalers in working group 
discussions and interviews.

4. Roadblocks and  
potential solutions

Most European retailers and 
wholesalers embarked on their 
respective sustainability journeys long 
ago. However, not all initial targets 
were as ambitious as they should 
have been in light of the magnitude of 
the challenge. Additionally, retailers 
and wholesalers face a number of 
roadblocks and barriers that keep them 
from achieving their sustainability 
targets as quickly and effectively 
as they aspire to. Examples of such 
roadblocks, as articulated by retailers 
and wholesalers in working group 
discussions and interviews, include:

 Ȼ Prioritization of other investments 
with a higher NPV or shorter 
payback periods. This arises partly 
due to a lack of experience with 
investment in sustainability. In 
the Triple Transformation Survey, 
about 50 percent of companies 

21 Triple Transformation Survey.

said that sustainability was not a 
priority, or that the company did 
not have enough funds to invest in 
sustainability initiatives.21 

 Ȼ Conflicts of interest connected 
with other key transformation 
topics. Improvements such as store 
automation (part of the digitalization 
transformation) may create higher 
GHG emissions due to the intensive 
use of technology such as cameras, 
sensors, and servers. The challenge 
is to optimize the store remodeling 
in a holistic way, considering factors 
such as productivity gains, cost, and 
GHG emissions.

 Ȼ Capability gaps and legal issues 

that impede collaboration 
with value-chain partners or 
competitors. This creates an issue 
because such collaboration may 
be needed to reduce Scope 3 GHG 
emissions.

SUSTAINABILITY

Direct cross-sector enablers
In some areas, retailers and 
wholesalers seek direct public support, 
including: 

 Ȼ Regulation. Retailers and 

wholesalers say that governmental 
regulation could be harmonized and 
simplified across countries within 
and beyond the EU. This could 
help create a level playing field for 
domestic and imported products. 
Harmonized, simplified regulation 
might also enable players in the 
value chain to set and meet holistic 
sustainability targets in a timely 
fashion. 

 Ȼ Standards and norms. The 

methodologies used and approved 
to measure and trace sustainability 
impacts (such as GHG emissions, 
biodiversity impact, and health 
impact) could be aligned and 
harmonized across regions, 
building on existing standards 
and standards that are currently 
in development. A successful past 

22 https://www.gs1.org/industries/retail

example of introducing a universal 
standard in retail is the introduction 
of the barcode as defined by GS1 
standards.22 Because the barcode 
was cocreated in a sector-
wide effort, costs for individual 
players were kept low, while 
implementation was quick.

 Ȼ Financing. Retailers and 

wholesalers could be granted 
access to dedicated financing 
(such as subsidies, fiscal changes, 
and public–private partnerships 
to accelerate investment in 
sustainability (capex)).  

Indirect cross-sector enablers
In some areas, retailers and 
wholesalers seek indirect public 
support, which is support that could 
bring benefits not only for retail and 
wholesale, but for the entire value 
chain and for other industries as well, 
including:

 Ȼ Infrastructure. Additional 

public infrastructure could be 

established. Examples include 
fueling infrastructure for hydrogen 
and electric vehicles, collection 
and sorting infrastructure for 
product and packaging waste, and 
infrastructure for the utilization of 
waste streams. Also, more safe bike 
lanes could help decarbonize last-
mile delivery.

 Ȼ Research, development, and 

innovation. Public institutions could 
partner with private players or 
provide funding to drive research, 
development, and innovation around 
more sustainable alternatives 
(for example, technologies to 
decarbonize dairy or meat).

 Ȼ A safe space for precompetitive 
collaboration. Regulators could 
provide a safe space for retailers 
to work with their value-chain 
partners and peers to design 
sustainable solutions jointly without 
being punished for violation of 
antitrust regulations. This may have 
to include leeway for retailers and

wholesalers to collaborate with 
energy providers to share the cost 
of the transition to renewable and 
self-generated energy.

 Ȼ Consumer education. Public 

institutions could help educate 
consumers about sustainability, 
for example, regarding repair as 
the first choice (as opposed to 
purchasing a new product), or the 
impact of diet on their health and 
the environment.

Company-specific enablers
Retailers and wholesalers believe 
public support is needed to enable 
and accelerate the sustainability 
transformation of the sector. In 
addition, they may have to implement 
certain internal, company-specific 
enablers to drive change, including:

 Ȼ Investment levels. Retailers and 

wholesalers need to increase their 
investment in sustainability and link 
it to value creation.

 Ȼ  Data transparency and traceability. 
The transparency and traceability of 
sustainability impacts of products 
along the entire supply chain could 
be improved with the help of clear 
criteria and digital tools at the 
product and the company level.

 Ȼ Management attention and 

resources. Top executives should 
put sustainability initiatives at the 
top of their agenda, incorporate 
sustainability into the corporate 
strategy, lead by example, and make 
resources available as needed.

A lot of the measures above are already 
happening, but not at the scale and the 
speed that is required. Next to a change 
in customer mindset, reliable data 
may be the most important enabler of 
all. Without high-quality data, it may 
be impossible to establish a baseline, 
especially for Scope 3 GHG emissions. 
That said, retailers and wholesalers 
suggest that any new standards should 
be built on existing ones. The sector is 
also seeking standards and solutions 
that are globally applicable and 
facilitate data sharing.

 Ȼ  Capabilities. Companies need to 

make sure they have the right talent 
and skills in their organizations, 
whether through recruitment or 
training.

 Ȼ  Key performance indicators (KPIs). 
Companies should establish clearly 
defined internal sustainability 
KPIs (especially commercial 
ones), cascade them down to all 
levels, and make them part of their 
company performance reviews or 
incentive systems.

 Ȼ  Central steering. Sustainability 
initiatives should be managed 
centrally as part of a holistic 
transformation program, led directly 

by the business, and progress should 
be tracked, both at the level of 
individual initiatives and holistically.

 Ȼ  Consumer information. Retailers 
and wholesalers should drive 
consumer awareness and empower 
consumers to make informed 
choices. For example, clear labels 
based on harmonized criteria and 
digital tools (such as the digital 
product passport) could capture 
the holistic sustainability impact 
of products to support consumer 
demand for more sustainable 
products. This applies primarily 
to private labels, as retailers and 
wholesalers do not control the 
packaging of branded products.

The sustainability transformation 
of the sector is a major challenge 
and will require major investment. 
However, it could also present an 
opportunity for companies to save 
costs, create new business models, 
and differentiate themselves from 
the competition. Supporting the retail 
and wholesale sector in its efforts 
to advance sustainability could help 
increase resource efficiency, strengthen 
biodiversity, improve livelihoods, 
promote human health, and reduce 
upstream and downstream (Scope 3) 
value-chain GHG emissions. Since 
Scope 3 GHG emissions represent more 
than 95 percent of all GHG emissions 
in the sector, supporting retailers 
and wholesalers could contribute 
substantially to a holistic sustainability 
transformation in the EU.

While substantial investment will

customers will demand even more 
seamless digital interactions in an 
increasingly global market. Pure digital 
players will continue to raise the bar 
on customer experience, assortment,

and-mortar stores in the EU with the 
digital world will need to be enhanced 
to meet customers’ needs, improve 
sustainability, keep staff employed, and 
stay afloat.

1. The status quo

Automation, advanced analytics, 
and artificial intelligence (AI) have 
the potential to transform almost all 
functions across the retail and wholesale 
value chain, including enabling better 
supply-chain management, more efficient 
store operations, data-driven pricing, 

Digitalization has already transformed 
the retail and wholesale sector, 
especially in terms of channel mix. 
But the pace and magnitude of the 
transformation will likely accelerate 
up to 2030. The impact may be felt in 
every subsector and link in the value 
chain, from how goods are sourced 
and distributed to the ways they are 
marketed and brought to customers.

The European Commission has set 
digital targets for the sector. By 2030, 
more than 90 percent of SMEs should 
have reached some level of digital 
intensity in the use of information 
and communication technology and 
e-commerce, and 75 percent of all 
European companies should be using 
cloud computing, AI, and big data.1 

Many retailers and wholesalers are 
making progress but will likely need 
help reaching these targets and 
advancing the digital agenda across 

Digitalization is reshaping 

retail and wholesale on the 
front lines and behind the 
scenes. The importance of 
digital channels for sales is 

increasing. The retail and wholesale 
sector has a key role to play in pushing 
the EU to the next level of digitalization. 
As the share of e-commerce in the 
EU doubles to about 30 percent 
of the sector’s total sales by 2030, 
digitalization could generate more than 
€1 trillion in additional online sales in 
the B2C and B2B segments. 

To earn these additional sales, the 
sector will likely need to invest 
€155 billion (conservative scenario) 
to €230 billion (ambitious scenario), 
the equivalent of 0.4 to 0.6 percent 
of annual revenue (€10 billion to 
€15 billion for SMEs and €145 billion

2. The transformation

As digitalization transforms and 
reinvigorates the European economy, 
it can help retailers and wholesalers 
create new value. According to a 
McKinsey survey in 2021 of leaders 
in the consumer and retail industries, 
digital leaders generated 3.3 times more 
total returns to shareholders than digital 
latecomers between 2016 and 2020.2 The 
growth of e-commerce alone represents 
an opportunity for more than €1 trillion 
of additional online sales.3  Hesitating or 
choosing not to digitalize could be risky. 
Incumbents could lose market share 
to international e-commerce players 
who can easily serve customers across 
borders. 

To participate in digital growth and 
capture additional value through 
digitally enabled processes and 
operations, the sector will have to 
prepare for change in four areas: 
digital channels, automation, advanced 
analytics, and IT modernization.

Digital channels
The ongoing shift from physical to 
digital channels will likely continue 
for sales and service, driven mainly 
by an increase in consumer demand 
that companies will want to satisfy. 
Today, e-commerce represents about 
15 percent of retail and wholesale sales 
in the EU, a share we expect to double to 
30 percent by 2030, as noted in Exhibit 1. 

McKinsey’s scenario modeling indicates 
that the continued rise of e-commerce 
will likely drive about 90 percent of 
overall growth in the retail sector—
with significant differences across 

subsectors and countries. The share of 
grocery in e-commerce, for example, 
is likely to grow from 6 to 13 percent 
by 2030. In nonfood retail subsectors, 
such as apparel and furniture, the 
share is poised to grow from 25 percent 
today to well over 50 percent by 2030. 
Geographically, the Netherlands, 
Denmark, Finland, and Sweden are the 
most advanced markets in the EU in 
terms of e-commerce penetration.

In this decade, digital interactions 
between shoppers and retailers will 
most likely become the norm for 
purchases made online and offline. 
Almost all nonfood sales journeys 
will likely have at least one online 
touchpoint—whether it’s discovery, 
research, or after-sales service—
continuing a long and powerful trend. 
Between 2017 and 2020, the share of 
digital customer interactions in the EU 
tripled from 18 to 55 percent,4 driven

mostly by changing customer habits, 
preferences, and expectations. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has 
accelerated this trend. The share of 
pure-digital players keeps growing, and 
more digitally savvy customers expect 
seamless experiences across channels. 
The role of brick-and-mortar stores 
will continue to change, and the mix 
of channels will continue to diversify. 
Some digital channels are already well 
established: retailers’ online shops, 
wholesalers’ shopping platforms, 
marketplaces, and mobile apps. Soon, 
new digital channels may become more 
important. Social commerce is on the 
rise, and the emerging metaverse could 
also bring opportunities for retailers.

While e-commerce will likely be the 
principal driver of top-line growth 
in retail and wholesale in the 2020s, 
it may also continue to significantly 
disrupt the market as customers 
demand better service, including faster 
deliveries, even as profitability declines 
in some subsectors. For example, EBIT 
margins in online grocery can range 
from a high of zero to a low of negative 
15 percent. Omnichannel players, in 
particular, struggle to generate profits 
in e-commerce. 

The shift to digital channels could also 
require companies to repurpose close to 
10 million square meters of commercial 
real estate by 2030—about 2 percent 
of the total—to prevent space from 
becoming obsolete, mainly in nonfood 
subsectors. In apparel alone, space may

already beginning to rethink the role of 
physical stores, for example, by focusing 
on advice and haptic experiences to 
complement online stores. In addition, 
new ideas in urban development may be 
needed to repurpose real estate as more 
space becomes available.

While e-commerce may disrupt 
traditional channels and business 
models, it also brings a wealth of 
opportunities to create new value 
and strengthen the bonds between 
companies and their customers. 

Automation
In 2021, the job vacancy rate in the retail 
and wholesale sector hit an all-time 
high of 1.8 percent, up from 1.0 percent 

in 2012.5 Demographic changes, 
including the aging population, may 
further aggravate the labor shortage. 
Automating repetitive tasks can give 
employees more time for value-adding 
work. Of course, the value of automation 
varies across subsectors, company 
sizes, and countries. For example, return 
on investment in automation tends to be 
better in places with higher wages and 
lower unemployment. 

According to McKinsey research, 40 to 
50 percent of the tasks in some retail 
and wholesale subsectors have a high 
potential for automation.6 In the Triple 
Transformation Survey, 37 percent 
of respondents at large companies 
said they plan to reach a high level 
of automation in their warehouses 
(26 percentage points more than the 
current level) and central functions 

(32 percentage points more) by 2030.7 
As technology becomes more powerful 
and less expensive, automation will 
become more accessible for many more 
companies, although it could still be too 
expensive for some SMEs.

Advanced analytics
Incumbents in the sector will need to 
harness advanced analytics and AI 
to compete with data-driven players. 
Advanced analytics has the potential 
to generate benefits of up to one 
percentage point of EBIT in the next 
few years.8 As more companies grow 
aware of the value at stake, the use of 
advanced analytics could become the 
norm for the entire sector in the EU. 

According to McKinsey estimates, 
just 10 of the more than 100 use 
cases for advanced analytics account

for 80 percent of the value at stake 
(Exhibit 2). As technology continues 
to evolve, advanced analytics can help 
players to price better through new 
insights into key value indicators, to 
personalize promotions, and to improve 
product and assortment selections at 
the individual store level, each of which 
can deliver a more than 2 to 3 percent 
uplift in sales.

Advanced analytics will likely become 
increasingly valuable as more new 
data becomes available. Researchers 
at Statista expect the amount of 
data created, captured, copied, and 
consumed each year to nearly triple 
from about 64 zettabytes in 2020 to 
more than 180 in 2025.9 (A zettabyte is 
a trillion gigabytes.) 

The number of data specialists with the 
necessary skills is growing, which will 
help many companies capture the value 
of advanced analytics, but competition 
for this talent will remain fierce. To 
attract and retain the digital talent 
they need, retailers and wholesalers 
will have to provide highly compelling 
value propositions or train existing 
employees to fill those essential roles.

To capture the full value of digitalization, 
enable the changes described above, 
and keep pace with digital-native 
companies, retailers and wholesalers 
will benefit from modernizing their IT 
architecture. 

Modernized IT architecture allows 
retailers and wholesalers to accelerate 
their IT development, to enable 
additional analytics use cases and 
automation, to overcome data quality 
issues, and to integrate on- and 
offline systems into true omnichannel 
systems. Such integrated omnichannel 
systems can give customers the 
seamless experiences they expect 
across channels and platforms, as 
both B2C and B2B customers are 
increasingly using online channels in 
their purchasing journeys. The sector 
may also consider adopting new, agile 
ways of working to keep pace with 
pure-digital players and the evolving 
expectations of customers.

DIGITALIZATION

While larger players will tend 
to build internal resources and 
capabilities to make a successful 
digital transformation, most smaller 
companies will probably outsource 
some functions, using skills as a 
service and software as a service 
(SaaS) to keep costs variable instead of 
building large, fixed-cost positions.

While many retailers and wholesalers 
are upgrading their IT, most are still 
in the middle of their journeys toward 
modern architecture and operating 
models.11 In McKinsey’s Triple 
Transformation Survey, 84 percent 
of respondents at large companies 
(which constitute just 1 percent of all 
companies but generate 50 percent of 
revenue in the sector) said they expected 
to significantly upgrade their IT systems 
and architecture in the coming years.

Generally, enterprises with fewer 
than 50 employees lag behind larger 
companies in investment in IT and 
digitalization—and this gap has 
grown over the last decade.12 In some 
countries, such as Greece, Poland, and 
Portugal, less than 40 percent of the 
employees of small enterprises have 
access to connected computers at work. 

3. Actions for consideration

To ready the sector for an even more 
digital future, players of all types, from 
SMEs to large companies, can benefit 
from establishing digital transformation 
as a central element of their business 
strategy. To make a successful digital 
transformation, many companies in the 
sector should invest more in the four 
areas outlined above—digital channels, 
automation, advanced analytics, and IT 
modernization (Exhibit 3).

The EU retail and wholesale sector 
already invests a lot in digital 
transformation—an average of 1.7 to 
2.4 percent of revenue is invested in IT, 
including operating expenditure (opex) 
and capital expenditure (capex)—but 
much less than the 4.5 to 6.0 percent 
invested by leading pure-digital players 
(Exhibit 1 on page 7).  

The industry’s total additional 
investment (cash-out) required to make 
the digitalization transformation by 
2030 may range from €155 billion to 
€230 billion, the equivalent of 0.4 to 
0.6 percent of annual revenue. Up to 
one-third of this investment may be 
required in the next three to five years 
to modernize IT.

DIGITALIZATION

Digital channels
To further expand digital sales 
channels, players in the sector can 
act along three areas: expanding the 
supply-chain and logistics network 
to prepare for further e-commerce 
growth, building or enhancing digital 
sales channels, and reinventing the role 
of brick-and-mortar stores.

Adapting and expanding supply-chain 
and logistics networks may require 
a total investment of €40 billion to 
€50 billion by 2030. Most of these 
funds will likely be provided by large 
companies, although SMEs will be 
able to enable their online businesses 
using the new infrastructure, such as 
fulfillment services provided by large 
companies. 

The most important step in supply 
chains and logistics will likely be 
rethinking warehouse networks. 
Assuming that warehouses are 
now operating at or near maximum 
capacity, the number of warehouses 
and fulfillment centers will have to 
increase to meet the growing demands 
of e-commerce orders, both in terms 
of increased volume and service level, 
as customers demand faster deliveries. 
In some subsectors, additional or 
enhanced dark stores and in-store 
picking resources may be required. 
Grocers may need to set up last-mile 
delivery networks by investing in 
fleets of vehicles or partnering with 
existing last-mile players. In nonfood 
subsectors, delivery tends to be 
outsourced to logistic players, so most 
retailers and wholesalers will not have 
to make any investments of their own.

As the share of e-commerce keeps 
growing, retailers and wholesalers will 
likely need to do more than just ramp 

up logistics networks and reinvent 
the role of physical stores. In addition 
to improving or building their online 
shops on their own websites, they will 
also benefit from: leveraging other 
online platforms, such as social media; 
partnering with existing marketplaces; 
or a combination of these approaches. 

The investment required to build digital 
sales channels will likely total €1 billion 
to €3 billion, mostly from SMEs, as 
most large companies in the sector 
have already built web shops. Initially, 
SMEs can rely on SaaS solutions to set 
up online shops for €5,000 to €20,000, 
but they may have ongoing operating 
costs, including digital advertising and 
product assortment costs.13 While this 
might be feasible for some SMEs, these 
costs might still be too high for others.

Retailers and wholesalers may also 
consider building in-house e-commerce 
and digital marketing capabilities. This 
could include commercial and category-
management skills for product 
selection and pricing strategies,14 
digital marketing capabilities to drive 
online traffic and increase conversion 
rates along purchase funnels,15 and 
technical IT skills to build and maintain 
e-commerce websites.16 

The growth of e-commerce may not 
only increase the need for additional 
logistics capacity but also have a major 
impact on traditional stores. As the 
share of online orders grows, offline 
retail in many subsectors, especially 
nonfood, will likely see transactions 
decline, and many retailers may need 
to reduce their physical footprints. 
Some may continue to thrive by finding 
opportunities with new formats and 
concepts and by digitally enabling 
stores. 

Reinventing brick-and-mortar stores 
could require investment totaling 
€30 billion to €50 billion through 2030. 
For example, some brick-and-mortar 
stores could take on new functions 
as showrooms that provide shoppers 
with sensory experiences not available 
online, along with in-person advice 
and customer support. In-store digital 
technology may help some retailers 
increase productivity and continue to 
attract customers to stores. 

While there is no shortage of in-store 
technology, not all solutions will be 
equally relevant in the reinvention of 
brick-and-mortar retail. Technology 
related to checking out, replenishment, 
and stock management could see the 
largest increase in adoption at scale 
in the coming years. Self-checkout 
solutions may become increasingly 
popular to increase convenience and 
drive productivity, a development 
accelerated by hygiene concerns during 
the pandemic.17 

Adoption could increase for smart 
carts, traffic sensors, and radio-
frequency identification (RFID) tags 
to enable fully automated checkout 
solutions. In addition to accelerating the 
checkout process, RFID technology can 
help optimize inventory management—
in the nonfood sector, RFID is already 
increasing goods availability by 5 
percent.18 

Ultimately, physical stores may become 
more comprehensively digitalized 
as more retailers and wholesalers 
enhance the shopping experience by 
making it easier for consumers to find 
products, obtain information, make 
purchases, and access services.

DIGITALIZATION

Automation
The most promising areas for 
investment in automation are 
warehouses and processes in finance, 
payroll, and other support functions, 
although their size will vary across 
subsectors and countries.19 For example, 
the potential for automation is limited 
in furniture, home improvement, and 
DIY warehousing because of product 
characteristics in these subsectors. And 
countries with low labor costs generally 
have lower automation potential 
because the cost savings may be too 
small to justify investment.

Based on the maturity of technology 
today, by 2030 investment in 
automation for warehouses and 
support functions could total €30 billion 
to €35 billion. More storage activities 
could be automated in existing 
warehouses, such as case and pallet 
storage, with autonomous vehicles 
and robots. Robots could also do 
more picking and depalletizing in 
existing warehouses. Robotic process 
automation could increase the pace 
and productivity of many activities, 
especially in support functions and 
back-office processes, such as data 
extraction and form filling in financial 
controlling, promotions, and marketing. 
The sector will likely start piloting 
autonomous fleet solutions, although 
few are likely to be deployed at scale 
before 2030.

Advanced analytics
Retailers and wholesalers can 
explore opportunities to deploy 
advanced analytics across the value 
chain, including in central functions, 
such as assortment management; 
pricing and promotions optimization; 
supply-chain management, including 
demand forecasting and planning; 
and store operations, from inventory 
management to labor scheduling. 
Analysis shows that the investment 
required to establish the necessary 
resources—including people, tools, 
and licenses—may total €5 billion to 
€10 billion through 2030.

To take full advantage of advanced 
analytics, large retailers and 
wholesalers may consider setting up 
cross-functional centers of excellence 
that can help orchestrate deployment 
and oversee the execution of use cases 
throughout the organization. Companies 
that embrace advanced analytics will be 
able to make more informed decisions 
more quickly, tailor their offerings more 
closely to customers’ changing needs—
for example, by automatically optimizing 
assortments at the individual store 
level—and reduce costs through more 
accurate sales forecasting and ordering. 

Modernization of legacy IT
Today, the IT systems many retailers 
and wholesalers rely on have a number 
of drawbacks. First, online and offline 
channels are often not integrated. 
Second, data is often kept in silos. Third, 
making changes to existing systems is 

often difficult and takes a lot of time. In 
effect, many retailers and wholesalers 
struggle to implement and roll out digital 
innovations, and they are frequently 
outpaced by purely digital competitors.

To reap the benefits of digitalization, 
retailers and wholesalers should 
consider doing three things: upgrade 
their IT architecture, set up a high-
performing IT operating model, and 
strengthen cybersecurity. The required 
cash-out for all three elements 
amounts to €50 billion to €85 billion. 
The bulk of this investment will 
likely be dedicated to modernizing IT 
systems and applications. Currently, 
retailers and wholesalers invest 
between 1.7 percent and 2.4 percent 
of their revenue in IT, split into about 
55 percent in opex and 45 percent in 
capex.20 This number varies between 
subsectors and business models.

IT architecture upgrade
Architecture can enable true visibility 
across channels. Customers expect 
a seamless experience; for example, 
they may want to be able to use their 
online shopping cart as the basis for 
a discussion with sales personnel in a 
physical store. To support omnichannel 
shopper journeys, retailers may need 
to introduce a layer to their IT systems 
that integrates different front ends 
and systems for supply management, 
merchandising, customer relationship 
management, and enterprise 
administration.

DIGITALIZATION

Data can be liberated from the silos in 
which they reside, and a single source 
of data for all applications can be 
established. Investing in robust data 
technology—from data ingestion and 
storage to data analytics tools—often 
allows retailers and wholesalers to 
enrich the customer experience (by 
personalizing what customers see 
on the website based on their recent 
in-store purchases) and increase 
operational efficiency (through 
better demand forecasting and stock 
refurbishment). Finally, systems can be 
modularized so that each can evolve 
without impacting the rest of the 
technology landscape. This step is often 
beneficial, as the intensity and pace of 
change will increase, and companies 
will want to decrease the ripple effect 
of each change.

An IT architecture upgrade can be made 
in two steps. First, legacy IT can be 
upgraded—for example, by improving 
data access with APIs, upgrading 
to the latest versions of existing 
software packages, and implementing 
a 360-degree view of the customer 
to enable omnichannel customer 
relationship management. In a second 
step, companies can move to flexible 

IT solutions, such as SaaS, cloud 
computing, and integrated business 
planning.

High-performing operating model
While the IT operating model 
transformation may not require major 
investment, it is indispensable to 
ensure the speed and agility needed to 
create value. Retailers and wholesalers 
can reengineer their business 
processes and ways of working, paying 
special attention to the integration of 
business and IT teams. Companies that 
transform their IT operating model 
effectively can reduce IT running costs 
by as much as 20 percent.21 These 
funds can be reallocated to building 
new tools and capabilities, or they can 
be used to improve profitability. Specific 
levers to transform the IT operating 
model include new, agile ways of 
working and investment in sufficient 
internal technological expertise. 
Relevant roles include data scientists, 
digital marketing specialists, and user 
experience experts. As technology 
increasingly becomes a differentiating 
factor, the development of an internal 
pool of highly skilled data engineers 
can be beneficial. An in-house team can 
improve performance and substantially

SCENARIOS

Two different scenarios were 
assessed to estimate the 
potential cost of the digitalization 
transformation required for the EU 
retail and wholesale sector. In the 
first, more conservative scenario, 
a more moderate digital disruption 
across the main transformation 
levers was assumed, namely within 
IT upgrade, store digitalization, 
and adoption of automation 
technologies. In the second, more 
ambitious scenario, the EU retail 
and wholesale sector embarks on 
a larger transformation requiring 
higher incremental investments in 
digitalization across the entire value 
chain. Specifically, the scenarios are 
based on the following assumptions:

 Ȼ Conservative. Incremental 
investments of up to double 
current IT spend in IT upgrades 
by 2030; digitalization of brick-
and-mortar stores by up to 
40 percent and 10 percent of 
existing footprint within food and 
nonfood sectors, respectively; 
automation to represent 
80 to 90 percent of annual 
warehousing costs.

 Ȼ Ambitious. Incremental 

investments of between double 
and triple current IT spend in IT 
upgrades by 2030; digitalization 
of brick-and-mortar stores by up 
to 60 percent and 20 percent of 
existing footprint within food and 
nonfood sectors, respectively; 
automation to represent up 
to 110 percent of annual 
warehousing costs.

Investing in IT architecture, IT operating 
models, and cybersecurity is relevant 
for all aspects of a company’s digital 
transformation, and so IT modernization 
can unlock substantial value across the 
full value chain. Modern IT can drive 
digital sales, automation, and advanced 
analytics deployment, all of which can 
help to increase speed and flexibility, 
drive growth, and improve profitability.

reduce time to market, as well as 
help protect a company’s intellectual 
property. For details, see the chapter on 
skills and talent.

Stronger cybersecurity
Finally, companies can strengthen their 
cybersecurity capabilities to protect 
customer and enterprise data—for 
example, by implementing multifactor 
authentication, upgrading to a new 
generation of systems for consumer 
identity and access management, 
adopting zero-trust architecture, and 
setting up extended managed detection 
and response protocols.

Cybersecurity is relevant both for 
large companies and SMEs. Beyond 
the options listed above, retailers and 
wholesalers of all sizes can consider 
embedding cybersecurity into all new 
applications from the start. Microsoft 
research shows that more than 
50 percent of data breaches happen at 
the application level, yet on average 
over 70 percent of IT security budgets 
is spent on infrastructure.22 

4. Roadblocks and  
potential solutions

The retail and wholesale sector has 
been digitalizing for years, and most 
companies plan to incorporate new 
digital tools into their ways of doing 
business. Accelerating their digital 
transformations will help them to 
satisfy evolving customer needs, 
remain competitive in an increasingly 
dynamic market, and keep pace with 
international players. But this journey 
will not be easy. Significant roadblocks 
and obstacles, as articulated by 
retailers and wholesalers in working 
group discussions and interviews, may 
keep many players from digitalizing 
quickly and effectively.

Roadblocks and obstacles
A cost-driven mindset is one obstacle 
to digitalization. Many senior leaders 
see digitalization as a cost rather than 
an opportunity for long-term value 
creation, and they often consider each 
transformation independently rather 
than as interlinked parts of a necessary 
whole. Concerns about short-term 
profitability prevent many leaders

As the evolution of the market 
accelerates, the message is clear: 
adapt or fall behind.”

from developing a long-term strategic 
vision and taking steps to set up their 
business for digital growth. In the Triple 
Transformation Survey, 53 percent 
of respondents at large companies 
said digitalization would not be an 
investment priority for their companies 
before 2030.

This focus on cost often coincides with 
a lack of scale. For most incumbents, 
the substantial investment required 
for digitalization would come on top of 
the costs of running daily operations, 
including networks of brick-and-mortar 
stores. Many smaller players find it 
particularly difficult to take on this 
double burden, especially since returns 
on investment in digitalization may 
not materialize for several years. In 
fact, among the respondents who said 
digitalization was not an investment 
priority, about one-third highlighted the 
high up-front investment as the main 
funding obstacle.

Many retailers and wholesalers also 
lack the talent to drive digitalization, 
as the competition for data scientists, 
engineers, and other tech talent is 
rising across sectors. Meanwhile, 
complex rules, such as local tax 
requirements, may deter companies 
from expanding their cross-border 
presence through e-commerce. These 
factors, along with the risk of data 
breaches, scare many retailers and 
wholesalers away from embracing 
digitalization and leveraging data to its 
full potential. 

Potential solutions
To address these challenges and 
accelerate the digital transformation, 

public and private stakeholders can 
work together. Key cross-sector 
enablers include financing, education 
and awareness, and consistent rules 
and accounting principles. 

Stakeholders could demonstrate the 
value of digitalization by setting up 
learning programs to help motivate 
companies—including SMEs—to invest 
in and move toward digital platforms 
and solutions. Such programs could 
also help companies build an online 
presence, either with their own web 
shops or in external marketplaces.

Some retailers and wholesalers may 
also benefit from access to capital for 
investment in digitalization, especially 
for the initial IT upgrades required to 
enable a holistic digital transformation. 
In the Triple Transformation Survey, 
about 25 percent of respondents 
pointed out the limited availability 
of public and government support 
as a potential constraint in funding 
digitalization initiatives. In some cases, 
it may be possible to find cost savings 
to fund the digital transformation. If 
this does not work, alternative sources 
of financing may be required. This is 
primarily relevant for SMEs, as most 
lack the scale to support large up-front 
investments.

According to the executives interviewed 
for this report, cross-sector and 
regulatory efforts may be needed 
to simplify and align regulation and 
accounting principles, including trade 
simplification and VAT harmonization 
to foster cross-border trading and 
capex and opex guidelines that apply 
across countries and sectors. This will

DIGITALIZATION

help reduce administrative burdens, 
promote trade among European 
countries, and help protect the digital 
sovereignty of the European economy. 

Not all potential solutions require 
external stakeholder collaboration—
some issues can be addressed by 
retailers and wholesalers individually. 
For example, every company can 
build commitment throughout their 
organization to drive digitalization with 
a view to long-term value creation. 

Top managers should allocate sufficient 
resources for digitalization and help 
teams adapt their ways of working. 
About 54 percent of the respondents at 
large companies said the main reason 
for their lack of investment in the digital 
transformation is that funds are being 
spent in other areas. Human resource 
departments can make sure employees 
receive the necessary training, from 
basic digital literacy to function-specific 
skills; see the chapter on skills and 
talent for details. Generally, the link 
between IT and business operations 
can be strengthened to promote 
mutual understanding, ensure that 
IT architecture supports all relevant 
business needs, and make business 
leaders aware of IT opportunities, 
requirements, and constraints. 

Retailers and wholesalers can also 
acquire or build the IT skills and 
capabilities to drive digitalization. 
The number of job postings for data 
scientists now exceeds the number 
of candidates by a factor of three,23 
and many data scientists and other 
digital specialists prefer to work in 
sectors other than retail and wholesale. 
Many companies, especially smaller 
ones, may have to work with external 
partners to get the resources they 
need.

The challenges are many, to be 
sure, and some are daunting, 
especially for smaller companies. But 
customers’ needs and expectations 
will likely continue to rise—along with 
competitors’ capabilities—with each 
passing year. As the evolution of the 
market accelerates, the message is 
clear: adapt or fall behind.

Key takeaways
1. The retail and wholesale sector 
employs 26 million employees  
(13 percent of the EU workforce).  
It plays a key role as an education 
and training engine for the EU.
2. To meet the challenges of the

will need to train up to 13 million 
employees and hire up to 1.5 million 
new people every year through 2030.
3. The incremental investment

€35 billion through 2030, which 
will come on top of the €50 billion

new roles. According to our Triple 
Transformation Survey, only half of the 
workforce in the sector is ready for this 
transformation.

Our research indicates that European 
retailers and wholesalers may need to 
hire as many as 800,000 to 1.5 million 
new people every year until 2030, and 
10 to 13 million employees will need 
to acquire new skills. To meet this 
challenge, retailers and wholesalers 
will have to invest more in people 
development. This challenge is 
particularly acute for SMEs. While 
SMEs employ almost two-thirds of the 
sector’s workforce, SME investment 
in training has room to grow, mainly 
because of time and budget constraints 
(for example, opportunity costs of 
employees’ time spent in trainings).

The retail and wholesale 

industry is the largest 
private-sector employer 
in the EU, providing jobs 
for close to 26 million 

people, about 13 percent of the total 
workforce.1 In the coming years, 
retailers and wholesalers will have to 
accelerate a comprehensive skill and 
talent transformation to contribute to 
the lifelong learning of their employees 
and to stay competitive.

Meeting rising customer expectations

and training engine for the EU, the 
sector will need to embark on a skill 
and talent transformation, aided by 
public infrastructure that facilitates 
continued investment in education.

The size of the workforce will likely 
remain stable in grocery retail and 
in wholesale until 2030. In apparel 
retail, the number of people employed 
(full-time equivalents or FTEs) is likely 
to drop by about 2 percent every year 
through 2030. In other subsectors, the 
annual reduction of FTEs through 2030 
could be about 1 percent.2

1.The status quo

The sector has a key role in the EU 
as a vital education and training 
engine. While the retail and wholesale 
workforce makes up around 13 percent 
of the total EU workforce, it plays an 
even more important role in some 
markets. In Greece, the sector accounts 

for 18 percent of the total workforce 
and in the Netherlands, it makes up 
16 percent. For many Europeans, a job 
in retail and wholesale is a way to gain 
work experience that can help them 
transition to other sectors; it employs 
one in seven young Europeans. 

In addition to being the EU’s biggest 
private employer, the sector has a highly 
diverse workforce and offers career 
opportunities to people from a wide range 
of backgrounds, including members of 
minority groups, residents of rural areas, 
and those looking for part-time work. 
About 50 percent of retail and wholesale 
employees are women, compared to 
45 percent across industries in the EU, 
and more than 10 percent are under

2. The transformation 

Evolving consumer expectations and 
market dynamics are accelerating 
change in the retail and wholesale 
sector. The sector faces three main 
challenges: increasing productivity, 
driving the evolution of skills and roles, 
and becoming a magnet for talent.

Increasing productivity is imperative. 
This imperative is driven by the need 
to accelerate decision making and time 
to market to meet customer needs, 
cope with increased competition, find 
funding for digital and sustainability 
transformations, identify alternative 
growth avenues, and deal with 
pressures on revenue growth—now 
being amplified by inflation and 
consumers’ rising price sensitivity.

Average productivity in the sector 
could rise by about 2.1 to 2.6 percent 
annually as it adopts more digital tools, 
implements more advanced analytics 
use cases, and upskills talent across 
all functions.5 In certain subsectors, 

such as apparel, the ongoing shift 
to e-commerce will likely accelerate 
and further drive productivity. The 
associated decline in selling space may 
lead to a slight reduction in demand for 
shop floor roles. Demand is expected 
to rise for other roles, such as roles in 
last-mile delivery and logistics.

The evolution of skills and roles 
is being driven by new commerce. 
Relevant forces include the accelerating 
growth of omnichannel, which refers 
to using all available channels as part 
of a customer journey;6 the evolving 
role of stores as points of contact for 
consumers with different needs and 
expectations; the need for more data-
driven decision-making in all areas 
of organizations; and a shift to value-
adding tasks and business intelligence 
as more administrative tasks are 
automated.

In many roles, new skills may be 
required, such as skills in digital 
and analytics. New roles could 
emerge and become more important, 

including roles for data scientists, 
digital marketing specialists, and user 
experience experts. These roles can 
help many companies capture the 
value of digital channels, advanced 
analytics, and automation. The race for 
talent will likely remain competitive. 
Many retailers and wholesalers may 
need to build internal expertise and 
capabilities across the organization 
and increase employee attraction and 
retention. SMEs may have to outsource 
some skills and leverage pay-as-you-go 
services, thereby benefiting from the 
investments made by larger players.

In total, the sector may need to upskill 
10 to 13 million employees (equal 
to 40 to 50 percent of the sector’s 
total workforce) and hire 800,000 to 
1.5 million new people every year 
through 2030. Across functions and 
roles, the share of employees with 
higher qualifications will likely increase. 
The magnitude of change may differ 
across companies, depending on their 
business models, channel mixes, and 
other factors.

HOW FUNCTIONS AND 
ROLES COULD CHANGE

STORE OPERATIONS
 Ȼ Cashier. The increased use of self-
checkout and seamless checkout, 
which uses a combination of 
sensors and cameras, could 
reduce the time cashiers spend at 
the register by up to 50 percent 
by 2030,7 shifting staffing needs 
to free up time for new tasks. This 
could include customer support at 
self-checkout stations and picking 
products for online orders. Today’s 
cashiers may need to acquire 
new skills and deepen existing 
capabilities, such as customer-
assistance skills and basic 
knowledge of how to use digital 
tools, including self-checkout 
stations, digital price scanners, 
and smartphone apps.

 Ȼ Sales (replenishment). The 

productivity of stock care and 
replenishment on the sales 
floor could rise as stores adopt 
robotic shelf replenishment, 
digital price tags, and smart 
fridges that check inventory 
and expiration dates. Staff may 
have more time to specialize to 
improve customer service and 
revenue—by optimizing offerings, 
for example—but they may also 
need new technical and basic 
analytical skills for product and 
revenue analysis and additional 
role-specific knowledge.

half of new warehouses are even 
semiautomated,8  suggesting high 
potential for productivity gains 
via automation, such as by using 
automated order picking. But 
even as productivity improves, 
the number of warehouse jobs is 
expected to rise as e-commerce 
growth increases the need to fill 
orders and handle returns. People 
in warehouse roles may need 
new capabilities to make data-
driven decisions; use advanced 
analytics, for example, for 
demand forecasting; and manage 
the transition from offline to 
omnichannel operations, including 
stock and flow management for 
online stores.

 Ȼ Transport roles. Productivity 

may grow as more transportation 
companies use analytics, 
automate depalletizing, and adopt 
autonomous guided vehicles for 
loading and unloading. However, 
the number of transport roles 
is rising due to the growth of 
e-commerce and the increasing 
importance of seamless 
omnichannel operations. New jobs 
related to last-mile delivery are 
expected to emerge, partly in the 
ranks of retailers and partly on 
the payrolls of third-party service 
providers, such as postal and 
delivery services. New technology, 
such as delivery drones, may 
bring new skill requirements for 
technical maintenance and other 
roles.

SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS
 Ȼ Warehouse roles. Even in 
countries in the EU where 
automation readiness is high, only 

CORPORATE FUNCTIONS
 Ȼ Category management and 

marketing. The total number of 

people in these roles is likely 
to grow, mainly because of 
the growth of the sector itself. 
Many skill profiles could change 
substantially—for example, 
more category managers may 
have to adopt an omnichannel 
perspective—and analytical skills 
may become more important in 
pricing recommendations, store-
specific stock keeping unit (SKU) 
selection, vendor negotiation 
support, mass promotion 
optimization, personalized 
promotions, and other areas. 
Employees may need analytical 
and technical skills to understand, 
pressure test, and apply system-
based outputs, such as for 
dynamic pricing, management of 
online traffic and conversion rates 
along the purchase funnel, and for 
e-commerce website maintenance.

 Ȼ HR roles. While automation and 
analytics will likely help speed 
up or reduce the number of 
administrative tasks in HR, from 
uploading CVs to conducting 
online tests of candidates instead 
of in-person first-round interviews, 
the number of HR jobs in retail and 
wholesale is likely to increase until 
2030. Potential driving factors 
include the need for professional 
strategic workforce and talent 
planning and the training required 
to master the skill and talent 
transformation. To succeed in their 
evolving roles, HR employees may 
need new analytical and technical 
capabilities—and to improve social 
and emotional skills to coach and 
attract diverse talent.

SKILLS AND TALENT

these potential challenges, SMEs may 
need to find and use expertise from the 
market, for example, by outsourcing 
certain IT functions to external 
providers.

Overall, the sector will likely need 
to invest even more in people. On 
its current path, the sector would 
likely invest an estimated €50 billion 
to €70 billion by 2030 to develop its 
workforce, or 1.0 to 1.5 percent of total 
labor costs.11 Large companies may 
need to invest approximately 30 percent 
more, and SMEs, on average, may need 
to more than double their budgets. 

Incremental investment in workforce 
development totaling €25 billion to 
€35 billion through 2030 will likely be 
required (€15 billion to €20 billion for 
SMEs and €10 billion to €15 billion for 
large companies), or about 0.1 percent 
of sector revenue. Total investment, 
both current and incremental, could 
amount to €75 billion to €105 billion 
over eight years—on top of the time 
and other resources already invested 
in on-the-job training and other 
informal learning, which have not been 
quantified.

Becoming a magnet for talent has 
become critical. Many industries 
are also looking for new talent to fill 
new roles, particularly in digital and 
analytics, and retail and wholesale 
companies will need to compete. The 
job vacancy rate in the retail and 
wholesale sector reached an all-time 
high of 1.8 percent in 2021, up from 
1.3 percent in 2020 and 1.0 percent in 
2012, reflecting the current difficulty of 
filling job openings across all sectors of 
the economy.9  

To stay competitive, retailers and 
wholesalers can define clear plans 
for people and talent evolution to 
support business strategies. These 
plans could include migration schemes 
for roles and skills (which are plans 
for employees to transition into new 
roles) and a narrative description of the 
company’s employee value proposition 
(EVP). An EVP encompasses the full set 
of financial and nonfinancial benefits 
and rewards an employee receives, 
such as development and growth 
opportunities. It should be anchored by 
clear, concise, and compelling answers 
to the key questions a prospective 
employee might ask: Why should I work 
for this company? What opportunities 
for growth will I have? How does this 
company support the causes I care 
about?

Potential developments  
by 2030 

By 2030, retailers and wholesalers 
may need to upskill 10 to 13 million 
employees, equal to 40 to 50 percent 
of the total workforce, to help them 
thrive in new and evolving roles 
while improving talent attraction and 
retention and raising productivity. 
Many companies in the sector will 
need to hire more highly-skilled 
employees than before —or have to 
find the capabilities they need through 
partnerships, outsourcing, and other 
means. 

Given that 99 percent of retailers and 
wholesalers in the EU are SMEs,10 
smaller firms will need support to gain 
access to information, practical know-
how, and dedicated support to help 
upskill their workforces. To navigate

training programs can play key roles 
on and off the job, as can collaboration 
with public or private education 
providers; for details, please see the 
box “Examples of existing upskilling 
programs.” 

Upskilling training programs will 
likely include a combination of remote 
and in-person learning. According 
to our Triple Transformation Survey, 
68 percent of large retailers and 
wholesalers use multiple upskilling 
methods today—internal and external, 
in person and digital. More than three-
quarters of respondents use internal 
online or digital platforms. The need for 
training providers, digital training tools, 
and certification will likely grow—and 
retailers and wholesalers may need to 
make recurring investments in lifelong 
learning. The sector as a whole may 
need to invest a total of €25 billion to 
€35 billion in upskilling initiatives by 
2030, which is 40 to 60 percent more 
than it does today.

3. Actions for consideration

Potential steps can be grouped into the 
following four action areas:

 Ȼ Skilling. Providing more 
apprenticeships through 
professional vocational and 
educational training (VET) to 
prepare people for careers in the 
sector.

 Ȼ Upskilling. Offering on- and off-

the-job training to give employees 
the new skills required for evolving 
roles.

 Ȼ Reskilling. Providing training to 

give employees the skills they need 
to transition to new jobs within or 
outside the sector.

 Ȼ Attraction and retention. Enhancing 

the appeal of the sector as a 
whole and the appeal of individual 
companies with sharper EVPs.

Skilling
In some countries, VET is a distinct 
professional pathway, set up separately 
from college or university education. 
In these countries, such as in Austria 
and Germany, VET combines on-the-job 
training with classroom learning (“dual 
education”), providing promising career 
and income opportunities, particularly 
in commerce. This type of system 
is normally built on a strong social 
partnership between public and private 
players and a mutual commitment to 
invest in the skills of young people. 
VET requires substantial investment 

by the companies that provide on-the-
job training, while classroom training 
is provided by public professional 
schools. This dual concept is based on 
the shared conviction that investing in 
the skills of young people is worthwhile 
to ensure the workforce is future 
ready. Like any skilling program, VET 
requires continuous improvement and 
adaptation to new skill requirements. 
For instance, HDE and BGA, retail and 
wholesale associations in Germany, 
have developed a new e-commerce 
profile in close cooperation with trade 
unions. This is an example of how 
educational innovation can help meet 
the evolving skills needs in a very 
dynamic sector.

Decathlon’s training center for 
apprentices provides another example 
of an educational program that aims 
to prepare people to enter a role in 
retail or wholesale. The center, set up 
in partnership with the French national 
agency for professional training for 
adults (AFPA), provides apprentices 
with the qualifications necessary for the 
sale and repair of sports products.12 

Upskilling
As roles evolve, employees may 
require new, cross-cutting skills, such 
as social and emotional competence, 
including empathy and coordination 
with others, learning agility, and the 
ability to deal with change. Function-
specific skills could also be necessary, 
such as advanced analytics for pricing 
specialists, and customer servicing 
and technical expertise for consumer 
electronics sales personnel. Internal

EXAMPLES OF EXISTING 
UPSKILLING PROGRAMS

Upskilling can take many forms. A 
few examples of the most common 
types include the following:

 Ȼ Government-driven programs. 
Skillnet Ireland, a business 
support agency, is tasked with 
developing the workforce to 
enhance the competitiveness, 
productivity, and innovation of 
Irish businesses.13 

 Ȼ Sector-driven VET. Such 

programs, typically part of 
a country’s public education 
system, provide young people 

with qualifications for work in 
the retail and wholesale sector, 
including in SMEs. VETs can 
be a form of upskilling as well 
as skilling (as is the case with 
the e-commerce apprenticeship 
programs of the retail and 
wholesale associations HDE and 
BGA).14 

 Ȼ Company training. REWE Group 
offers employees a range of 
development options, including 
a program that prepares store 
employees for manager and 
district manager roles.15 

 Ȼ Cooperation with educational 

institutions. Carrefour Romania 

and the Bucharest University 
of Economic Studies formed 
a strategic partnership to 
help employees develop skills 
for managerial positions, 
with courses in leadership, 
communication, digital strategy, 
and more.16 

 Ȼ Scholarships or tuition support. 
Amazon Europe’s Career Choice 
program provides up to €8,000 
per worker for professional 
training and tuition, helping 
employees acquire skills to 
pursue their careers at Amazon 
or elsewhere.17 

Reskilling
Training will likely be key in helping 
employees transition to new and 
different roles internally, at other 
companies, or outside the sector. Most 
reskilling programs today resemble 
those created for upskilling in terms 
of setup, structure, and stakeholders 
involved. Employers can help workers 
assess their prospects and help them 
acquire the skills they need to succeed 
in new opportunities.

Attraction and retention
For some vital roles, such as 
data scientist roles, retailers and 
wholesalers are competing for talent 
not only with each other but also 
with companies in other sectors. 
The number of job postings for data 
scientists now exceeds the number of 
candidates by a factor of three.18 To 
fill gaps in these areas and retain top 
talent, businesses in the sector may 
need to sharpen or renew their EVPs. 

According to McKinsey scenario 
modeling, the sector may need to invest 
€500 million to €3 billion in reskilling 
initiatives through 2030. Because 
the challenge is substantial and a 
successful transformation is crucial 
to provide the European workforce 
with rewarding employment and 
development opportunities, retailers 
and wholesalers may want to cooperate 
with public institutions, seek public 
funding, and consider partnering with 
other sectors and public or private 
educational institutions.

Retailers and wholesalers can 
distinguish themselves with flexible 
work models, function-specific perks, 
and diversity and inclusion programs, 
for example, for employees with 
disabilities. One European apparel 
retailer offers flexible working policies 
for its digital talent, allows them to 
choose their own devices, and sponsors 
their attendance at global digital 
forums and conferences.

4. Roadblocks  
and potential solutions

As European retailers and wholesalers 
seek to optimize people development 
models and attract top talent, many 
encounter roadblocks, including limited 
workforce readiness and difficulties in 
finding, recruiting, and retaining talent. 
These challenges could persist for 
years to come, and the difficulties may 
be even greater for the many SMEs 
without the time or budget to provide 
off-the-job training, meaning these 
challenges may require a dedicated 
approach. 

Examples of roadblocks, as articulated 
by retailers and wholesalers in working 
group discussions and interviews 
include:

 Ȼ High attrition rate. Across the 

sector, the average attrition rate is 
25 percent, with variation across 
subsectors and regions. The rate 
exceeds 27 percent in Central and 
Northern Europe, but is under 
20 percent in Southern and Eastern 
Europe.

 Ȼ Limited workforce readiness. 

According to the Triple 
Transformation Survey, only 
50 percent of the current workforce 
in the sector is ready for the skill 
and talent transformation that lies 
ahead.

 Ȼ Low investment in training at 

SMEs. While large companies invest 
1.0 to 1.5 percent of their labor 
costs in upskilling and reskilling, 
SMEs invest much less in formal 
training, mainly because of time and 
budget constraints. Entrepreneurs 
and employees alike may find 
that continuous learning is key to 
staying competitive in a changing 
marketplace.

 Ȼ Talent scarcity. In the Triple 
Transformation Survey, more 
than 40 percent of companies cite 
difficulty with finding talent with 
the right skills as the top barrier to 
successful transformations.

 Ȼ Increasing share of employees 
with higher qualification levels. 
Many of the new roles emerging in 
retail and wholesale require higher 
qualifications than current roles. 
Retail and wholesale companies 
can sharpen their EVPs to attract 
and retain the highly qualified 
talent they need. Labor costs are 
likely to increase, putting additional 
pressure on subsectors that 
already operate with low margins. 
For example, the average EBITDA 
margins in grocery are just 4 to 
6 percent.

Enabling sector-specific and company-
specific measures will likely be 
required to help the sector continue to 
prosper and keep providing promising 
opportunities for employees.

4.1 Cross-sector enablers
The sector will likely need to enhance 
or put in place the following four cross-
sector enablers to clear roadblocks and 
ready the sector for the skill and talent 
transformation that lies ahead:

 Ȼ Professional education and training 
systems. Professional education 
that prepares people for careers in 
retail and wholesale will likely be 
key to the success of the sector. VET 
varies across countries. In Spain 
and Portugal, education for positions 
in retail is much less formal than 
for positions in hospitality, where 
undergraduate degrees are available. 
Other countries have developed 
more formal VET systems for retail 
and wholesale. In Germany, the 
apprenticeship model known as 
Ausbildung includes about 70 percent 
on-the-job training and 30 percent 
classroom education, helping more 
than 80,000 young people enter the 
retail and wholesale sector every 
year.19  

SCENARIOS

Two different scenarios were 
assessed to estimate the 
potential cost of the skills and 
talent transformation for the 
EU retail and wholesale sector. 
In the first, more conservative 
scenario, the change in roles and 
skills (and therefore the impact 
in additional investments for up-/
reskilling) is more moderate, 
resulting in the conservative 
scenario for sustainability and 
digital transformations. In 
the second, significantly more 
ambitious scenario, EU retail and 
wholesale will experience a more 
disruptive change in required 
roles and skills, and therefore 
will require higher incremental 
investments for up-/reskilling, 
resulting in the more ambitious 
scenarios for sustainability and 

digitalization transformations. 
Specifically, the scenarios 
are based on the following 
assumptions:

 Ȼ Conservative: Incremental 
investments in people 
development for approximately 
40 percent of employees, and 
800,000 new jobs need to be 
filled yearly across the sector 
until 2030

 Ȼ Ambitious: Incremental 
investments in people 
development for approximately 
50 percent of employees, and 
1,500,000 new jobs need to be 
filled yearly across the sector 
until 2030

The sector could benefit from funding 
for internal training to support workers’ 
transitions to new roles.”

In addition to VET, higher or 
tertiary education may become 
more important for the retail 
and wholesale ecosystem 
as demand for highly skilled 
personnel rises. Roles that require 
higher education include data 
scientists with advanced digital 
skills, pricing specialists with 
retail- and wholesale-specific 
skills, and cybersecurity experts. 
In the Netherlands, retailers 
cooperate closely with educational 
institutions to help employees 
earn associate and bachelor’s 
degrees. The universities of applied 
sciences Stenden and Avans 
specialize in retail undergraduate 
programs, creating curriculums 
in close collaboration with retail 
and wholesale companies and 
associations.

 Ȼ Joint effort to make the sector 
more appealing to employees. 
To attract and retain employees, 
retailers and wholesalers can 

coordinate and cooperate with 
their peers. HDE, for example, runs 
sector-wide image campaigns to 
attract more young people. The 
advantages of working in the sector 
could include diversity, inclusion, 
flexibility, attractive tasks such 
as interaction with customers, 
and a variety of opportunities for 
all profiles regardless of skills 
or experience, such as advanced 
digital training and apprenticeship 
for students and those at the 
beginning of their professional lives.

 Ȼ Institutional and funding support. 
The sector could benefit from 
funding for internal training to 
support workers’ transitions 
to new roles. According to our 
Triple Transformation Survey, 
55 percent of large companies 
and 78 percent of SMEs say 
they do not have the funds to 
improve their employees’ skills 
or talent. Support for SMEs could 
come from public sources—the 
French government, for example, 
provides dedicated funding for skill 
development to SMEs with fewer 
than 50 employees.

 Ȼ Partnerships. Not all skills need to 
be built internally. Some companies 
with less resources can acquire 
capabilities as a service from third 
parties, which could help them 
maintain more flexible operating 
models. This could include digital 
marketing, accounting, customer 
relationship management, advanced 
IT tasks, and cybersecurity. The 
skills-as-a-service concept is 
particularly relevant for SMEs who 
may seek to outsource functions, 
but they might also need to 
consider the costs and potential 
issues, such as data privacy and 
security.

SKILLS AND TALENT

Since the transition may be 
particularly challenging for many 
SMEs, they could benefit from 
local learning platforms for digital 
commerce, training, and technical 
support, developed in partnership 
with national associations or larger 
companies. Amazon, for example, 
offers SMEs free access to online 
training, expert advice, live events, 
and services through its Small 
Business Accelerator.20  

4.2 Company-specific enablers
In addition to cross-sector enablers, 
retailers and wholesalers may consider 
ramping up internal capabilities to 
ready their organizations for the 
transformation, including the following: 

 Ȼ HR resources and capabilities. 

Many companies still rely on short-
term approaches to workforce 
management, typically based on 
headcount. They look for new 
hires only when the headcount 
drops below a predefined level, or 
when a concrete position becomes 
vacant. In the future, retailers and 
wholesalers may want to take 
a more proactive approach to 
training and recruitment. Potential 
considerations include whether 
the HR department has the right 
resources and capabilities, such 
as strategic workforce planning. 
Companies can also clarify their 
EVPs and plan to acquire the 
training resources they need. New 
capabilities in HR can be built 
internally or provided by external 
partners, which may be particularly 
relevant for SMEs.

 Ȼ Technological infrastructure and 
tools. Retailers and wholesalers, 
especially larger firms, can also 
build or enhance technological 

infrastructure and tools as needed 
to deploy training programs at 
scale, such as online learning 
platforms. 

The retail and wholesale sector will 
likely remain one of the biggest 
employers in the EU and continue 
to play a key role in society with its 
diverse and inclusive character. The 
sector will stay relevant because it 
is where millions of Europeans start 
careers and lifelong learning journeys. 

While retailers and wholesalers are 
already investing heavily in workforce 
development, they may have to invest 
an additional €25 billion to €35 billion 
in upskilling and reskilling through 
2030 to transform the workforce and 
seize the opportunities that lie ahead. 
They may also need to forge new 
partnerships with their peers, trade 
associations, public stakeholders, and 
training providers.
