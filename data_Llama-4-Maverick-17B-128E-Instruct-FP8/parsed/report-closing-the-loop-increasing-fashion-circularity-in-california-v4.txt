Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaThe fashion value chain is predominantly linear 
and global. It has put the apparel industry on an 
unsustainable path.

In 2020, Californians bought and wore 510,000-
530,000 tons of clothing.i Some 500,000 of those 
tons will eventually enter landfills ― covering 
an area about 3.5 times the size of the City of Los 
Angeles.ii More than 97 percent of the textiles used in 
this clothing are virgin materials. Less than 1 percent 
of the materials worn today will resurface in clothing 
manufactured tomorrow.iii 

Such waste requires transformative change. The 
key lies in circularity ― specifically, in building a 
closed loop for recycling materials back into the 
manufacturing process, reducing both waste and 
reliance on natural resources. 

To date, California has seen relatively little investment 
in (or research into the benefits of) closed-loop 
recycling of apparel, so progress on building 
collection, sorting, and recycling capacity to execute 
this process has remained limited. We launched 
this research to understand what effort building a 
closed-loop system in California will require, what 
stakeholders need to participate, and what initial 
impact the effort may have.

Our research shows that the effort promises to be 
very worthwhile.

California consumers want closed-loop recycling. Our 
survey results revealed the following:

Among surveyed consumers, 54 percent anticipate 
buying more clothes made with recycled materials.iv

 — Younger Californians (18-24-years-old) report a 
willingness-to-pay premium of almost 15 percent 
for clothes made with recycled materials.v

 — 92 percent of surveyed consumers would 
participate in a brand-sponsored apparel 
recycling program, if offered the opportunity.vi

A fully closed-loop apparel recycling system in 
California could potentially achieve a total holistic 
impact (economic, environmental, and social benefits) 
of $7-9 billion a year, based on our estimate of total 
holistic impact of approximately $3.5-4.5 billion from 
closed-loop recycling of polyester, which represents 
nearly 50 percent of apparel textile fibers thrown 
away by Californians.vii That translates into holistic 
impact of $2.70 for every $1.00 spent.viii Scaled up 
across the US, closed-loop apparel recycling could 
achieve a total holistic impact of $50-70 billion.ix

ii  Assumes about 85-90 percent, or about 455,000 tons, of apparel sold to and worn by Californians ends up in landfills through curbside 

municipal solid waste (MSW) collection. An estimated 25,000 tons of production losses and 15,000 tons of deadstock also end up in landfills 
through curbside MSW collection. Of the remaining tons of apparel used by Californians and collected through other channels (i.e., donation 
centers, consignment stores, drop-off containers, mailed-collection programs, curbside textile collection programs, and in-store take-back 
programs), about 5 percent, or 5,000 tons, is ultimately landfilled. See Chapter 2, Exhibit 5 in the main report for a further breakdown and 
assumptions. Average weight of, and average m2 of fabric required to manufacture, a t-shirt and pair of jeans used to convert estimate of weight

chemical-use reduction, job creation, GDP growth from job creation, revenue growth, and cost savings. The $50-70 billion potential holistic 
impact for the US is based on sizing for the polyester use case in California. Since pure and blended polyester apparel accounts for an estimated 
49 percent of all apparel, an estimated multiplier of two can be used to roughly size the total holistic impact for California of switching from virgin 
to recycled apparel for all fiber types (e.g., polyester, cotton, man-made cellulosic fibers), which would be an estimated $7-9 billion. Additional

roughly size the holistic impact for the US from switching to recycled apparel from virgin for all fiber types: Source: “Gross domestic product

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in California$7-9 billion

Total holistic impact - economic, environmental, and social benefits - from creating a 
closed-loop apparel recycling system in California (scaled up across the US, closed 
loop recycling could achieve a total holistic impact of $50-70 billion)

 — Build a chemical recycling facility to process 

polyester textiles because chemical recycling is 
critical to sustaining the quality of textile fiber over 
many iterations. 

But any effort to build closed-loop recycling capacity 
faces a “catch 22” ― the disconnect between the 
supply of and the demand for recycled materials. 
While benefits outweigh costs system-wide, both 
benefits and costs are distributed unevenly among 
stakeholders across the value chain. Unlocking 
the total holistic impact will require actions to level 
the playing field, such as forging public-private 
partnerships, enacting recycling-friendly policies, 
and encouraging vertical integration in the apparel 
industry.

The California apparel industry can start building 
closed-loop recycling capacity today to reduce waste 
and reliance on limited natural resources. We hope 
that this report will establish the opportunity at stake 
for textile circularity in California as well as the actions 
stakeholders across the fashion industry can take to 
capture it. Furthermore, we hope this report can serve 
as the foundation for further research and action 
across other materials and geographies, catalyzing 
even more positive economic, environmental, and 
social benefits.

We identified eight core initiatives that could 
significantly advance fashion circularity for apparel 
made with polyester (100 percent or blended) in 
California and help unlock this holistic impact. Future 
efforts could build on these initiatives to address 
other textile materials: 

 — Purchase recycled polyester to replace virgin 
polyester in apparel, probably at a premium, but 
with few other switching costs involved. 

 — Promote and sell recycled apparel to shoppers, 
touting clothing “made with recycled polyester”. 

 — Partner with apparel manufacturers to collect 
pre-consumer polyester waste, such as scraps 
and rejected apparel that manufacturers discard. 

 — Partner with retail stores to collect pre-

consumer polyester waste, such as unsold 
garments that are typically thrown away if not 
diverted for low-cost resale or donation to 
employees.

 — Partner with existing collectors, such as 

donation or consignment stores, to divert post-
consumer polyester waste that would otherwise 
be downcycled or sent abroad. 

 — Introduce and scale curbside textile collection 
in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and select Bay 
Area counties because the high cost of curbside 
collection makes it most viable in densely 
populated metropolitan areas.

 — Build a highly automated facility to sort and 
deconstruct polyester textiles because the 
inability of recycling processes to handle more 
than one type of textile waste and the potential for 
unsorted waste to introduce contamination make 
sorting necessary.

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaIn its current form, the fashion industry is on a path to 
consuming more and more resources and generating 
more and more waste. In 2018, the global fashion 
industry generated about 4 percent of all greenhouse 
gas emissions globally.1 Less than 1 percent of 
clothing purchased today is eventually recycled 
back into new clothing.2 The industry faces an 
existential decision ― degrade the habitat where its 
consumers live or completely reinvent operations and 
capture new value, meeting customer expectations 
for sustainable action by businesses. 

Circularity could anchor the fashion industry’s 
reinvented operations. Building a more circular value 
chain could address environmental issues and also 
improve social and economic indicators by creating 
new jobs and opportunities for economic expansion.

Circularity has three dimensions that would reshape 
the typical fashion lifecycle:3

Reduce. How can we design and manufacture 
products that use more safe, recycled, or renewable 
textile materials (e.g., organic cotton)?

Reuse. How can we keep products in use longer 
(e.g., increase accessibility to resale or secondhand 
markets)? 

Recycle. How can we turn used textile materials that 
have reached the end of their useful life into new, 
high-quality materials that can re-enter the fashion 
value chain?

While all three dimensions are critical to building 
a circular economy, this report focuses on the 
challenges and opportunities involved in recycling 
materials back into the apparel manufacturing 
process and building a closed-loop fashion lifecycle in 
California. 

The closed-loop fashion lifecycle
The closed-loop fashion lifecycle consists of eight 
major stages (Exhibit 1). In today’s value chain, most 
economic activity happens in the front half of the 
lifecycle, from input materials to manufacturing to 
retail / consumption. As detailed below, a global 
network of companies produces raw fibers, yarns, and 
fabrics for assembly into clothes sold in retail stores. 
But the industry has little infrastructure to support 
the three stages of textile waste management ― 
collection, sorting, and recycling ― that are critical 
to closing the loop in the fashion lifecycle.

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaAchieving full circularity requires a local, rather than 
a global, model, given the inherently local nature of 
the collection stage of the lifecycle. In the context 
of textile-to-textile recycling, conducting these 
activities within a given region could have incremental 
impact (e.g., CO2e, emissions abated, water saved) vs. 
the costs, while creating local jobs and encouraging 
economic mobility.

extracted in raw form, e.g., petroleum used for 
polyester fiber.4 Approximately 70 percent of yarn 
is made in and exported by China, India, Vietnam, 
and the US, and almost two-thirds of the total 
finished apparel is exported from China, the EU, 
and Bangladesh.5 Many countries participate in the 
production of clothes made from cotton and synthetic 
materials (Exhibit 2).

But the industry is very far from having a viable 
local model for circularity. The fashion value chain 
is predominantly linear and global. More than 97 
percent of the materials used in fashion products are 
virgin materials ― derived from natural resources

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaConsider the environmental impact of producing 
a standard t-shirt (Exhibit 3). A t-shirt made 
exclusively from polyester emits ~11 kilograms of 
CO2e, consumes ~380 liters of water, leverages ~1+ 
pounds of chemicals, and uses 2-7 m2 of land during 
production.6

The activities at the front end of the apparel value 
chain cause most of this environmental impact 
(Exhibit 4). Raw material production, processing, and 
garment manufacturing account for the lion’s share of 
a typical garment’s impact ― 70-75 percent of the 
fashion industry’s emissions.7 Spinning and weaving 
generate 22 percent of the holistic climate impact, 

including impact on water and land, across the global 
apparel value chain; cut and sew / finishing generates 
41 percent of the impact.8

Significantly reducing this impact would require 
tailored actions not only in managing pre- and post-
consumer apparel waste, but also in sourcing and 
manufacturing. Circularity includes many of the steps 
needed to decrease the environmental impact of 
apparel across its lifecycle.

Input materials
Textile production employs many input materials, but 
full circularity would require using only 100 percent 
textile-to-textile recycled materials. That said, 
recycled materials are not inherently carbon-neutral 
or chemical-free. Energy and chemicals (depending 
on the recycling process employed) are still required 
to recycle end-of-life textiles into new fibers, albeit 
less of these resources than producing new textile 
materials from scratch. Various types of new and used 
input materials can help reduce the carbon or water 
footprint associated with a particular garment. These 
materials could vary by type and origin, as described 
below:

Example input materials, by type:9

 — Carbon-neutral or negative. Material releases 
net zero carbon emissions or captures carbon 
during production (e.g., carbon-neutral merino 
wool)

 — Organic or regenerative organic. Material 

sourced in a way that meets standards for soil 
health, animal welfare, and farmworker fairness 
(e.g., regenerative organic cotton, organic linen)

 — FSC-certified. Material comes from forests that 
meet sustainable forestry certification standards 
(e.g., FSC natural rubber)

 — Responsibly / sustainably sourced. Material 
selected and sourced in a way that reduces 
environmental impact (e.g., cotton sourced 
through sustainable practices that conserve 
water)

 — Non-renewable. Material selected and sourced 
without regard for environmental impact or 
secondary input intensity required 

Example input materials, by origin:10

 — Renewable. Material from a source that 

replenishes naturally (e.g., cotton, renewable 
sugarcane)

 — Recycled. Material made from waste (e.g., 
recycled polyester from PET bottles)

 — Virgin. Material made from previously unused 
resources (e.g., polyester from petroleum)

15

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaManufacturing
Apparel manufacturing involves three main stages: 
spinning to turn input materials into yarn, weaving 
or knitting to turn yarn into fabric, and cut and sew 
/ finishing to turn fabric into apparel. Improvements 
in operational efficiency across the three stages 
can reduce carbon emissions and use of water 
or chemicals. But applying circularity can reduce 
environmental impact even further, in addition to 
delivering social and economic benefits.

Achieving full circularity in the manufacturing process 
would likely require:

 — Making infrastructure and process improvements 
so manufacturing can better handle recycled 
textile materials

 — Addressing all manufacturing waste (12-30 
percent of total textiles used in the garment 
manufacturing process annually), such as 
deadstock ― any unsellable and unused 
inventory, including damaged or incorrectly 
produced items ― and samples, by improving 
collection and recycling of these materials.11

Waste management
Managing end-of-life textile waste is the key to 
capitalizing on circularity in the fashion industry. 
Success requires applying circular principles to 
collecting, sorting, and recycling waste.

Collecting. Recycling requires the ability to collect 
end-of-life products. Today, the US collects less than 
15 percent of apparel and footwear for recycling.12 
Moving toward circularity, the fashion industry can 
aspire to get as close to 100 percent collection as 
possible, but channels and capacity are too few 
and too small to approach this goal at present. The 
industry would likely need to create new collection 
strategies, including take-back programs, mail-back 
programs, and curbside pickup, to reduce barriers 
to consumer recycling and apparel- and footwear-
specific waste drop-off / pickup locations for large, 
industrial, and pre-consumer sources of fashion 
waste. 

Sorting. Effective waste management also 
requires strong sorting capabilities. Ideally, a fully 
operationalized, automatic sorting center could 
handle high volumes and diverse textile materials, 
including complicated fabric blends and items 
like shoes. Building such a center would require 
developing advanced automatic sorting technology 

and scaling up sorting capacity. Capitalizing on the 
benefits of a local model for recycling and building 
a network of centers to minimize transportation and 
maximize access to recycled outputs could also 
require some standardized sorting guidelines and 
establishment of predictable supply and demand to 
enable efficient operations. 

Recycling. Full circularity would recycle 100 percent 
of eligible materials back into apparel and footwear 
manufacturing and downcycle all materials that are 
ineligible for textile-to-textile recycling, e.g., cannot 
be cleaned. This would require significant investment 
to scale capacity and recycling technology, especially 
in chemical recycling. Current mechanical recycling 
processes have higher capacity than chemical 
recycling processes, but chemical recycling is 
better suited to maintaining high quality over many 
iterations.13

The potential economic, environmental, and social 
impact of circularity in fashion makes committing to 
local circular operations critical. But achieving full 
circularity in any geography would require addressing 
a number of significant challenges. Making the right 
choices would require careful analysis of location-
specific factors and development of standardized 
ways to compare the actions that might enable 
circularity (e.g., comparing the impact of each 
investment with the dollars invested). 

The following chapters explore the current and 
predicted states of the apparel industry in California, 
including the end-of-life challenges to achieving 
circularity, and consumer perspectives on circularity, 
including the price elasticity of fashion products 
made with recycled materials. Finally, using apparel 
made from polyester as a case example, because 
it is the most-used textile fiber in the world today 
(accounts for 52 percent of the world textile market),14 
the final chapter outlines the major initiatives required 
to achieve circularity in California and offers a tool 
for analyzing the tangible and intangible benefits of 
these initiatives.

While this report focuses on polyester-made apparel 
worn in California, its purpose is to provide a blueprint 
for evaluating the current state and potential 
benefits of closing the loop for other materials and 
geographies around the world.

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaLike the global fashion value chain, California’s 
fashion value chain is primarily linear and global. As 
a result of this structure, of the 510,000-530,000 
tons of apparel sold to and worn by Californians 
today, 490,000-510,000 tons will end up in landfills 
(covering an area about 3.5 times the size of the City 
of Los Angeles).15 Only about 5,000 tons ― less 
than 1 percent of total apparel textiles worn ― will be 
recycled into textiles used in apparel tomorrow. This 
chapter examines the flows and volumes of apparel 
in California, from input materials to final disposal of 
pre- and post-consumer textile waste (Exhibit 5).

Input materials and imported finished 
apparel 
The apparel value chain in California starts with 
about 1.1 million tons of material.16 Most is apparel 
imported into the state as finished goods; but some, 
about 30 percent, is input textile material produced 
in California; and an even smaller portion, about 15 
percent, is input textile material imported into the 
state. 

The input materials used in the California value chain, 
both those imported for apparel manufacturing and 
those used in imported finished apparel, consist 
overwhelmingly (97 percent) of virgin input materials, 
with 2 percent recycled materials from non-textile 
sources and less than 1 percent textile-to-textile 
recycled materials.17 This is consistent with fashion 
value chains around the world. 

California also produces some of its own input 
materials. In 2020, California produced about 
350,000 tons of cotton and polyester.18 Most of the 
input materials produced in California do not stay in 
the state for apparel manufacturing. Approximately 
80 percent, or about 280,000 tons, is exported, 
leaving some 70,000 tons for use in California apparel 
manufacturing.19 Along with the input materials 
imported into the state, net re-exports, California 
apparel manufacturing has about 205,000 tons of 
input materials available for use each year.

The input materials / manufacturing portion of 
California’s value chain is relatively small compared 
with the volume of finished apparel imported into 
the state. In 2020, California imported about 
600,000-660,000 tons of finished apparel, mostly 
from Southeastern Asia.20 A portion of the imported 
apparel was re-exported out of the state, leaving 
approximately 500,000 tons of finished apparel for 
sale in California. 

Manufacturing and deadstock, 
overstock, and samples
The manufacturing stage of the fashion lifecycle 
produces significant pre-consumer waste. Of the 
approximately 205,000 tons of input materials 
used in California apparel manufacturing, about 
20,000-30,000 tons is discarded during the apparel 
production process (due to reasons like cutting away 
extra fabric to match the desired shape of a garment 
or removing damaged input materials).21 Much of this 
waste ends up in landfills. 

Some 80 percent of the finished apparel made in 
California goes out of state for sale elsewhere.22 Of 
the remaining finished apparel, 5-15 percent never 
reaches retail stores ― it is instead used as samples 
or relegated to deadstock (including overstock).23 
This means that, of the finished apparel manufactured 
in the state, about 20 percent is sold directly to 
Californians. But most, about 75 percent, of the 
samples and deadstock still gets into the hands of 
Californians through such channels as direct gifts to 
apparel retail associates or donations and reuse.24 
Some imported finished apparel also winds up as 
samples or deadstock. 

Whether manufactured in state or imported, 
approximately 510,000-530,000 tons of apparel are 
sold to and worn by Californians every year.25

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaDonation centers and consignment stores tend to 
sort on-site in California; the other methods rely on 
central sorting facilities. Each step of the process 
adds a small percentage, about 5 percent in total, to 
the amount of apparel landfilled.30

Of the 65,000-70,000 tons of apparel initially 
diverted from the landfill, about 35,000 tons are sold 
secondhand; about 25,000 tons are downcycled; 
about 5,000 tons end up being landfilled; only about 
5,000 tons are recycled into feedstock to produce 
new apparel.31

Without changes to apparel lifespans, apparel 
demand growth, and the path from input materials to 
final disposal, even more end-of-life apparel will end 
up in California’s landfills. 2020 saw sales of about 
2.6 billion units of apparel in California.32 Based on a 
projected 1.3 percent CAGR in total units of apparel 
sold through 2026, apparel sales will reach about 
2.8 billion units in 2025.33 If the landfill rate stays at 
85-90 percent, landfilled apparel will reach about 2.5 
billion units. 

Increasing the collection rate for channels other than 
curbside solid waste collection or introducing new 
collection channels would divert more apparel from 
the landfill. It could also replace demand for apparel 
made with virgin fibers with demand for apparel made 
with recycled fibers ― a scenario explored later in 
this report.

The emissions associated with increasing apparel 
will also continue to grow. Through 2030, annual 
emissions growth for synthetics, including polyester 
and man-made cellulosic fibers, is estimated at 5 
percent, and annual emissions growth for cotton and 
other natural fibers is estimated at 1 percent. These 
growth rates contribute to keeping our planet well 
above the emissions levels needed to hold warming at 
1.5 degrees Celsius.34

Implications for closed-loop recycling of 
textiles in California
Increasing collection capacity for pre- and post-
consumer waste, combined with increasing recycling 
capacity, could improve circularity throughout the 
fashion lifecycle. 

While apparel sold in 2020 will not enter the waste 
management system for several years, apparel sold in 
past years has entered or will soon enter the system. 
On average, an item of clothing has a lifespan of four 
years or less.26 Socks last about two and a half years, 
while items like jackets can last more than six years.27

Collecting, sorting, and recycling waste
Given the vast volumes of clothing being sold and 
approaching end-of-life, California has a tremendous 
amount of apparel that has been or is about to be 
discarded. Californians use many channels to dispose 
of clothing. Curbside solid waste collection, which 
goes straight to the landfill, is by far the largest. It 
accounts for 85-90 percent of apparel waste each 
year, including waste from industrial and residential 
sources ― about 495,000 tons in 2020.28

Several other collection methods divert the remaining 
10-15 percent of end-of-life apparel from the landfill 
in California:29

 — Donation centers and consignment stores. People 
bring clothes they no longer want for sale in these 
stores, both large donation centers and smaller 
boutique consignment stores. This channel 
collects 4-7 percent of end-of-life apparel.

 — Drop-off containers. These decentralized 

containers belonging to collection organizations 
collect 4-7 percent of end-of-life apparel.

 — Mailed collection programs. Consumers ship their 
end-of-life clothing to a collector. These programs 
collect 0-2 percent of end-of-life apparel.

 — Curbside textile collection programs. Separate 
from the typical waste management service, 
these programs collect <1 percent of end-of-life 
apparel.

 — In-store take-back programs. These brand-

specific programs collect 0-2 percent of end-of-
life apparel. 

Donation centers and drop-off containers account 
for the lion’s share of collection. Each handles some 
25,000 tons of apparel a year. In contrast, mailed 
collection and in-store take-back programs each 
handle about 5,000 tons a year, while curbside textile 
collection handles less than 3,000 tons.

After collection, clothes are sorted to determine what 
is suitable for selling secondhand, either locally or 
internationally, for downcycling (or recycling, although 
today less than 1 percent of textile waste enters true 
closed-loop recycling), or for sending to the landfill.

2020 (estimated 65-75% of total textile fiber output is used in apparel) and that 100% of textile material imports are fabrics. 
Input material production in this case is assumed to be cotton and polyester only. Cotton and polyester made up ~76% of the fiber market in 2020. Remaining input 
materials production in California is assumed to be negligible. ~605,000 bales of cotton were produced in California in 2020,  at an assumed ~480 pounds of cotton per 
bale; this converts to kilotons to get ~145. US polyester fiber production in 2019 was ~1,275 metric kilotons, and we assume similar production for 2020. A ~2,205 pounds

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaIncreasing collection of manufacturing waste and 
deadstock diverts less material from the landfill but 
faces fewer challenges to collecting, sorting, and 
recycling the material, thanks to its higher reliability 
as an input source and general profile as clean textile 
scraps.

Increasing collection of end-of-life apparel has the 
potential to divert more material from the landfill but 
faces significant challenges, including the difficulty of 
accounting for fragmented and unpredictable flows.

Capturing both opportunities to divert more material 
from the landfill would require increasing awareness 
of and access to collection locations, building broader 
understanding of the types of apparel accepted, and 
establishing partnerships between industrial sources 
of waste and recyclers. 

Increasing the capacity and ability to handle complex 
inputs offers additional opportunities to improve 
circularity. These opportunities involve both the 
sorters who receive apparel after its diversion from 
the landfill and prepare it for recycling and the 
recyclers. Increasing collection does little good if 
downstream operations cannot use the collected 
materials. This opportunity faces two challenges ― 
the manual-labor-intensive nature of sorting and the 
nascent state of gold-standard closed-loop textile 
recycling technologies, such as chemical textile-to-
textile recycling.

management across the US and in California.

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaTogether, the collection, sorting, and recycling stages 
of waste management could catalyze the transition 
from a linear to a circular fashion lifecycle. This 
chapter explores the activities that happen in each 
of these stages across the US and then examines 
California’s textile and non-textile waste management 
infrastructure.

Textile waste management across the 
US
Textile waste comes from both pre-consumer and 
post-consumer sources. Pre-consumer waste, 
which accounts for 30 percent of total textile waste, 
consists of materials that never go home with 
consumers because they are lost in the production 
process (e.g., scraps, samples, and rejected apparel). 
Post-consumer waste, which accounts for the 
remaining 70 percent, consists of garments bought, 
worn, and then discarded or donated by consumers.35 

Collecting waste
Apparel manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, 
and retail sites that serve major fashion brands often 
generate pre-consumer waste. Since most apparel 
manufacturing takes place in Southeast Asia, pre-
consumer waste lost in the production process is 
typically generated outside of the US.36 But fabric 
scraps and deadstock in the US also end up as pre-
consumer waste when they cannot be sold, even at 
a steep discount. Because sorting is expensive and 
recycling capacity is limited, fashion brands often pay 
a premium to divert their waste from the landfill.

Curbside solid waste collection and free donation 
channels typically handle post-consumer apparel 
waste. As discussed in Chapter 2, curbside solid 
waste collection is by far the most common channel, 
with 85-90 percent of textile waste ending up in the 
landfill.37  

Across pre- and post-consumer waste collection, 
increasing the percentage of used apparel collected 
and diverted from the landfill is critical to scaling 
fashion circularity. By comparison, US diversion 
rates for aluminum and cardboard ― some of the 
most valuable commoditized recyclables ― are 
about 50 percent for aluminum cans, 90 percent for 
aluminum used in building and automotive materials, 
and 90 percent for old, corrugated cardboard.38 The 
last chapter of this report explores major obstacles 
to closed-loop textile recycling in greater detail, 
including potential drivers of low apparel diversion 
rates.

Sorting waste 
Sorting is possible only for waste collected through 
channels that avoid the landfill, such as donation 
centers, drop-off containers, mailed collection 
programs, curbside textile collection programs, and 
in-store take-back programs. Unfortunately, little 
apparel that enters traditional solid waste or single-
stream recycling gets sorted because the items are 
too damaged to salvage.

Currently, textile sorting is very labor-intensive. 
Sorting typically happens at donation centers / 
consignment stores or central sorting and / or 
distribution facilities operated by textile waste 
collectors. Closed-loop recycling requires first sort, 
second sort, and deconstruction processes (Exhibit 
6). (Note: Both pre- and post-consumer waste must 
be sorted and deconstructed before recycling. 
But some pre-consumer waste can skip the first or 
second sorting process if the collection method did 
not mix the waste with other apparel or textile types, 
such as a large shipment of all-white, 100 percent 
cotton scraps.) 

First sort. The first sort focuses on apparel quality 
and seasonality. Employees or volunteers examine 
each garment to determine whether it is wearable and 
then set aside the best items for sale by local or online 
secondhand retailers. They may sort garments that 
are wearable but unlikely to sell off the rack in the US 
by seasonality for sale to international wholesalers 
(e.g., summer clothes for hotter climates). Finally, 
items deemed non-wearable may be sorted out for 
lower-end uses, most often wiping rags or shredded 
stuffing.39

Second sort. Focused on textile type and color, the 
second sort is critical for textile-to-textile recycling, 
as it limits contaminants and ensures making the 
purest form of feedstock available to recyclers. 
Existing recycling technologies can handle 80-100 
percent cotton or polyester garments (plus some 
cotton-polyester blends).40 An effective second sort 
process would recognize these textile types, sort 
them by color as needed, and divert them for textile-
to-textile recycling.

But the second sort rarely happens in the US today 
due to high cost and lack of demand from recyclers 
still operating at pilot scale. Instead, about half of 
collected clothing is deemed non-wearable and 
downcycled for lower-end use. Less than 1 percent of 
all used apparel is sorted successfully for textile-to-
textile recycling. 

The second sort varies from completely manual 
to heavily automated. In a manual sorting facility, 
employees examine and sort garments by fiber type 

based on tag information. The process is inefficient 
and prone to human error. At most, an employee can 
sort 10-20 pounds of clothing per hour (equivalent 
to one or two loads in a standard top-load washing 
machine).41

An automated sorting facility uses high-powered 
camera technology to examine and sort garments 
by fiber type and color. Automation is more efficient 
and accurate than manual sorting. But it also requires 
more capital investment and energy to power the 
conveyor belts, camera technology, electrical and 
control systems, and compressed air and de-dusting 
systems.42 Industry experts generally agree that, 
while manual sorting can be employed as closed-loop 
recycling develops, the greater capacity, efficiency, 
and accuracy of automation make it the future of 
textile waste sorting.43 

25

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaCase study
Automated sorting in Sweden

Today, the world has few large-scale textile sorting 
facilities, and most of them employ hundreds of 
people to sort through materials manually. 

In 2021, the world’s first fully automated sorting 
facility for textile waste began operating in Malmö, 
Sweden. The facility is the product of a partnership 
among multiple private stakeholders, including the 
plant designer and builder, Stadler of Germany; plant 
operator, Sysav Industri AB of Sweden; and producer 
of Autosort technology, Tomra of Norway.44 The 
government-funded Swedish Innovation Platform 
for Textile Sorting (SIPTex) project was involved in 
financing the investment.45 

The industrial-scale facility, which has a maximum 
capacity of 4.5 tons per hour per line, opened after 
years of testing in a smaller pilot plant built in 2017. 
The facility receives pre- and post-consumer waste 
in bales that weigh about half a ton and can process 
textiles ranging from yarn and fabric scraps to 
rejected garments and used apparel. On a day-to-day 
basis, the facility requires employees only to start 
and stop the machines, feed textiles into the line, and 
remove the sorted bales at the end of the line.

A central control and dosing system manages the 
entire operation. Conveyor belts carry textiles through 
the facility for examination by Tomra’s Autosort 
optical sorting technology that is maintained by a 
compressed air and de-dusting system. At the end of 
each line, a baling machine packages textiles that are 
sorted by fiber type and color.

Deconstruction. Once separated from the rest of 
the apparel waste, recyclable textiles (predominantly 
cotton and polyester) require deconstruction, which 
involves removing tags, buttons, zippers, and other 
non-fabric materials from the textiles. Sometimes, 
even the thread used in seams needs to be removed 
before the sorted textiles go to the recycler. The 
process is labor-intensive, and to date no automated 
deconstruction technologies have been deployed at 
scale. Deconstruction can happen during the manual 
second sort or at the end of the line in an automated 
sorting facility.

Recycling waste
The waste management system sends pre- and 
post-consumer textiles to four common end-of-life 
destinations: landfill or incinerator, downcycling, 
textile-to-textile recycling, and secondhand or 
discount resale. This report focuses on opportunities 
to intervene when used textiles go to end-of-life 
destinations that offer lower value than textile-
to-textile recycling. These are opportunities for 
closed-loop recycling of apparel otherwise landfilled, 
incinerated, or downcycled.

Landfill or incinerator. Diversion from the landfill 
or incinerator is by far the largest opportunity for 
more effective recycling of pre- and post-consumer 
waste. Americans send about 17 million tons of textile 
waste to the landfill each year.46 That’s equivalent to 
dumping two solid waste trucks full of textile waste 
every minute. In addition, secondhand clothing sold to 
international markets often ends up in the landfill or 
incinerator. 

Once in the landfill, synthetic fibers like polyester 
can take at least 200 years to decompose. As they 
decompose, natural fibers like cotton or wool also 
generate methane ― a greenhouse gas 25 times 
more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in 
the atmosphere.47 

Downcycling. Today, about half of all donated 
clothing is downcycled, not sold secondhand.48 
Downcyclers include companies that repurpose 
garments as wiping rags or shred them for lower-end 
uses like home insulation, carpet fiber, and stuffing 
for mattresses or car seats. Unlike textile-to-textile 
recyclers, downcyclers can intake textiles that vary 
widely in type, quality, and impurity ― offering a 
convenient and cheap option for collectors looking 
to discard a large volume of used textiles that are not 
suitable for secondhand sale. 

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaBut separating recyclable garments (e.g., cotton 
and polyester) from the waste sent to downcyclers 
might open a window for circularity. Recycling these 
sorted garments could produce new clothing at a 
lower environmental and social cost than virgin input 
materials involve. 

Textile-to-textile recycling. Commercially viable 
technologies to produce recycled polyester, cotton, 
and man-made cellulose exist. Innovations in textile-
to-textile recycling offer an opportunity not only 
to reduce the waste piling up in landfills, but also 
to conserve the energy, water, chemicals, and land 
required to produce virgin input materials (e.g., 
farming virgin cotton or manufacturing polyester). 

Textile-to-textile recycling takes two forms:

 — Mechanical recycling transforms textile waste 
into reusable yarn without altering its basic 
chemical structure. This process typically shreds 
textiles (e.g., cotton) and pulls the shreds apart 
into fibers for re-spinning. Because the fibers 
get shorter in each cycle, the process is not fully 
circular. Recycling a textile by mechanical means 
can work only a finite number of times.49 

 — Chemical recycling uses a series of chemical 
reactions to break down used textiles into 
molecular building blocks called monomers. 
The process can reconstruct the monomers into 
recycled fibers (e.g., polyester or viscose) that are 
chemically identical to their virgin counterparts. 
This is the advantage of chemical recycling. 
Because quality does not diminish with each 
cycle, the process can approach full circularity. 
Apparel made with chemically recycled yarn can 
have the same tactile quality and performance 
as apparel made with virgin input materials, and 
textiles can be recycled ad infinitum.50

Today, five recycling technologies constitute the core 
of a more circular fashion system. Most mechanical 
and chemical technologies work with 80-100 percent 
pure cotton and polyester waste, but some methods 
tested at pilot scale can recycle man-made cellulosic 
textiles and blended fabrics (usually cotton-polyester 
blends).51 For details, see “Five core recycling 
technologies” sidebar.

Americans send about 17 
million tons of textile waste to 
the landfill each year. That’s 
equivalent to dumping two 
solid waste trucks full of 
textile waste every minute.

27

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaFive core recycling technologies

1.  Mechanical cotton recycling operates at commercial scale today, but several limitations prevent it from being a complete 

closed-loop recycling solution.

First, the process requires almost 100 percent cotton fabric inputs and outputs a lower-quality, rougher fabric than virgin 
cotton (due to the shortening of fibers during shredding).52 To address this problem, some producers mix virgin and recycled 
cotton fibers to produce yarn more similar to virgin cotton in texture and quality.53 

Second, the process is not fully circular, because the loss of quality during each cycle means that cotton can be recycled back 
into apparel only a finite number of times. 

Third, only recycled cotton made with pure white cotton inputs can produce true white or bright colors. 

Despite these limitations, cotton recycling is a better end use than downcycling or landfilling, making it a component of a more 
circular economy for textiles.

2.  Mechanical polyester recycling typically uses PET bottles or packaging as an input to produce recycled polyester fabric (the 
technology can also use polyester apparel textiles). Similarly, mechanical nylon recycling typically uses nylon items like fishnets 
to produce recycled nylon fabric. Therefore, the mechanical recycling of synthetic fibers is not a fully closed-loop textile-to-
textile solution. 

  We include this recycling method because most recycled polyester and nylon today comes from mechanical recycling. The 

technology operates at scale, and demand for the output is increasing as fashion brands seek to reduce their environmental 
impact. But the shedding of microplastics remains an issue with all polyester and nylon fabrics.54

3.  Chemical polyester recycling typically requires more than 80 percent polyester yarn or fabric feedstock.55 The process uses 
chemicals to break down the yarn or fabric into monomers, then builds the monomers back up into recycled polyester of the 
same quality as virgin polyester.56 The process is fully circular, but the recycled polyester produces microplastics that are a key 
sustainability concern. 

Still, the industry has acknowledged the need to scale chemical polyester recycling. Over 70 fashion brands have signed on to 
the Textile Exchange’s “2025 Recycled Polyester Challenge.” The challenge states that “chemical recycling…is a key part of 
the solution” to accomplish the goal of increasing recycled polyester use from 14 percent today to 45 percent by 2025.57 

  While promising technologies have been tested at pilot scale, industry dynamics have created a catch 22. The lack of sorted 
feedstock and guaranteed demand for output poses major risks to scaling, but without scale the cost of recycled outputs is 
much higher than virgin input materials, limiting demand.

4.  Chemical cellulose recycling faces a similar catch 22. The process, which inputs more than 80 percent cotton or man-made 
cellulosic fibers, does not operate at scale today. But recycled man-made cellulose (e.g., rayon) has commercial potential. 
When solvents are used to dissolve the fibers down to a liquid pulp, the recycled man-made cellulosic fibers that are output can 
have the same quality as their virgin counterparts. The process can even manipulate man-made cellulosic fibers to achieve a 
cotton-like touch and feel. 

5.  Chemical blended fabric recycling is nascent but represents a significant opportunity for a textile industry that produced $35 
billion of blended fabrics in 2016 alone.58 Some technologies are attempting to recycle blended fabrics (which make up at least 
50 percent of total apparel waste), but most are operating at laboratory or pilot scale.59

The most successful technologies appear to work with cotton-polyester blends, which account for about 20 percent of all 
blended fabrics.60 The recycled output has two components ― man-made cellulosic fibers (made from the cotton in the 
blend) and polyester fabric or PET pellets (made from the polyester in the blend). 

Blended fabrics present an additional challenge for textile-to-textile recycling. Separating fibers and impurities is difficult, and 
efficiency is limited, as is the ability to sell both output fibers.61

Secondhand or discount resale. Wearable clothing 
suitable for secondhand sale is not a target source 
of feedstock for recycling. When consumers are 
willing to purchase and wear a used garment, reuse is 
preferable to recycling. But approximately half of the 
clothing collected by secondhand retailers in the US 
is sent abroad or downcycled instead.62 Therefore, 
understanding how apparel ends up in secondhand 
or discount resale channels in the first place is 
important.

 — Secondhand resale. In the US, donation centers 
and consignment stores (online and brick-and-
mortar) sell post-consumer apparel deemed 
sufficiently high-quality. An estimated 10-20 
percent of donated clothing is sold locally, while 
an additional ~35 percent is sold abroad.63

 — Discount resale. Discount resellers typically 
purchase order cancellations, overstock, end-
of-season, and post-clearance garments from 
apparel manufacturers or retailers. The business 
model relies on buying pre-consumer garments in 
bulk, at a steep discount, and then reselling them 
to consumers at a relatively cheap price.

Textile-to-textile recycling technologies 
Chemical and mechanical recycling technologies have 
the potential to unlock the future of textile circularity 
if the industry can overcome the challenges and risks 
of scaling. 

Across the US, waste management of fashion textiles 
remains in its infancy, with very few textile-to-textile 
recyclers, all operating at pilot scale (Exhibit 7).64

Textile waste management in California
Textile circularity in California faces challenges 
across the waste management lifecycle. The largest 
bottleneck is the lack of sorting and recycling 
capacity. Even if that infrastructure existed, without 
improvements in collection, most apparel waste would 
likely never enter a channel that could lead to textile-
to-textile recycling. Today, most textile waste is simply 
thrown away, and once it enters the traditional solid 
waste or recycling streams, sorting it out is nearly 
impossible.65 The materials are effectively damaged 
and beyond recycling.66 

The sections that follow review key waste 
management practices in California and outline 
potential partnerships with incumbent waste 
management stakeholders. California’s waste 
management industry manages 40 million tons of 
organic waste, recyclable materials, and solid waste 
every year and employs more than 40,000 people 
across the collection, sorting, and recycling stages. 67

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaCollecting waste
California municipalities typically franchise collection 
of residential and commercial waste to haulers in 
exclusive zones. These haulers collect solid waste, 
recyclables, and green waste from homes and 
businesses curbside. Dozens of waste haulers 
operate in California; 20 percent are publicly owned, 
and 80 percent are private companies.68 The 
state has no large-scale curbside textile recycling 
programs.69

In addition, some private and non-profit companies 
collect donated clothing from households. 
Households donate most clothing through donation 
centers or drop-off containers concentrated in urban 
areas (Exhibit 8). Several fashion brands that have a 
retail footprint in California (e.g., Madewell with their 
denim program) have launched in-store take-back 
programs to collect used clothing for reuse / repair or 
recycling.70 

For each zip code, the maps show the number of 
collection locations per 10,000 residents. Even after 
accounting for differences in population density, 

the major players have very few collection locations 
outside the major metropolitan areas surrounding San 
Francisco and Los Angeles.71 (Note: The lightest color 
on the maps indicates zero collection facilities.) 

Sorting waste
Municipal solid waste (MSW) typically goes to a 
transfer station for consolidation into larger loads, 
without any sorting, before transportation to one 
of California’s ~175 landfills or a waste-to-energy 
facilities.72

Meanwhile, single-stream recycling waste goes to 
a materials recovery facility (MRF) for sorting into 
categories of recyclable materials (e.g., paper, glass, 
and plastic) and non-recyclable materials. Sorted 
recyclable materials are packaged into bales and 
sold wholesale to recyclers who pay for and process 
commodities like aluminum, paper, and certain 
plastics. Because each recycler typically handles 
specific materials, the industry is fragmented, but 
waste haulers and recyclers have strong established 
relationships.73

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaCalifornia has fewer than 100 large MRFs, and none 
of them sort textile waste.74 In fact, textiles that are 
mistakenly thrown in the recycling containers can get 
caught and damage the sorting equipment, because 
traditional MRFs are not designed to process textile 
waste. 

Still, California may be able to leverage existing 
transfer stations or MRFs to aggregate textiles for 
sorting. For example, a textile sorter could partner 
with a major waste hauler to aggregate pre- or post-
consumer textile waste at a transfer station already 
used to manage traditional MSW and recycling 
waste. By enhancing this transfer station with 
textile sorting capacity, the partners could leverage 
existing infrastructure for new operations that enable 
circularity.

Recycling waste
Textile recycling can aspire to reach a state of 
commercialization similar to other recycled products 
like aluminum and certain plastics. For example, 
waste haulers could play a crucial match-making role 
between fashion brands or consumers and textile-
to-textile recyclers who need feedstock. Waste 
haulers could also provide waste storage, logistics, 
and transportation support to recyclers. Because of 
their size and scale, waste haulers could even partner 
with textile recyclers to define and disseminate 
clear industry standards for sorting textile waste 
(i.e., standards that match recyclers’ feedstock 
specifications).75 

California waste management landscape
California’s waste management regulators and 
municipalities might play a critical role in advancing 
circularity. The Department of Resources Recycling 
and Recovery (CalRecycle) is responsible for 
enacting state-wide waste management policies and 
convening stakeholders, including municipalities, 
residents, and waste management companies.76 
Individual municipalities are responsible for funding 
and execution. Each municipality manages its own 
waste management services, often through contracts 
with private waste haulers.77

California has no state-wide policies or programs that 
explicitly address textile waste recovery.78 But two 
broader waste management initiatives could affect 
textiles:

 — Statute SB1383 set a state-wide goal of diverting 

75 percent of all organic waste (including 
textiles) by 2025.79 Passed in September 2016, 
SB1383 defined requirements for individual 
municipalities to divert organic waste (e.g., adopt 
a standard three-bin system to collect residential 
green waste, recyclables, and MSW) and might 
encourage textile waste recovery as municipalities 
work to comply with the requirements.80 According 
to CalRecycle, SB1383 can help meet California’s 
targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 
because organic waste in landfills contributes over 
20 percent of the state’s methane emissions.81

 — Recycling Market Development Zone Loan 
Program exists to help finance organizations 
or businesses located in California that prevent, 
reduce, or recycle waste through value-added 
processing or manufacturing. Eligible facilities 
can apply for loans to cover 75 percent of their 
total project costs, up to $2 million. Facilities 
must be located in a designated Recycling Market 
Development Zone and use waste feedstock 
generated in California.82 

Finally, some municipalities have piloted initiatives like 
monthly curbside textile collection and partnerships 
with clothing donation locations. But sustaining or 
scaling the initiatives has proven challenging, and 
many residential curbside pilots have ended due to 
high costs, lack of participation, or difficulty keeping 
textiles clean and segregated from other waste.83

This chapter reviewed the status quo of waste 
management across the US and in California today. 
Chapter 4 looks at a final key stakeholder in the 
ecosystem ― the California consumer ― because 
any efforts to build a more circular fashion economy 
must take consumer habits and attitudes toward 
sustainable apparel into account.

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in California61 percent of Californians who buy an average of 
0-1 articles of clothing per month report that they 
buy clothing made with recycled materials, this 
number increases steadily as the amount of clothing 
purchased increases. 93 percent of those who buy 
11-15 items a month state that they buy clothing made 
with recycled materials. California has room to grow 
the purchase rates of clothes made with recycled 
materials but already enjoys a high level of consumer 
engagement. 

We asked consumers about their future intention 
to buy clothing made with recycled materials. Most 
anticipate buying more clothes made with recycled 
materials (54 percent); only 7 percent anticipate 
buying fewer clothes made with recycled materials.

The intention to purchase more clothes made 
with recycled materials grows with the amount of 
clothing purchased per month. Only 43 percent of 
respondents who buy 0-1 items per month intend to 
buy more clothes made with recycled materials over 
the next 1-3 years, while 83 percent of those who 
buy 11-15 items per month intend to buy more clothes 
made with recycled materials. Their commitment 
may reflect a general industry trend toward using 
more recycled materials, as well as strong consumer 
demand for recycled materials.

People who spend more on clothing are more likely 
to purchase clothing made with recycled materials in 
the future. Among consumers buying casual apparel, 
41 percent of those who spend $0-100 per month 
anticipate buying more clothes made with recycled 
materials in the future vs. 75 percent of those who 
spend $401-500 and 63 percent of those who spend 
more than $500 (Exhibit 9). The fact that these 
consumers have stronger spending power in the 
industry creates incentives for brands to use more 
recycled materials in their products and communicate 
their commitment to doing so to consumers. 

Willingness to pay for recycled 
materials
The survey explored what, if any, premium consumers 
say they would be willing to pay for apparel made with 
recycled materials.

Determining how to accelerate circularity requires 
understanding consumers’ perspectives on and 
experiences with sustainability and circularity. 
To develop that understanding and identify 
opportunities for advancing toward circularity, we 
surveyed California consumers.84 We acknowledge 
that consumer surveys, especially when investigating 
virtuous behavior, are prone to respondent bias. 

This chapter discusses the survey results and their 
implications for efforts to accelerate circularity. 
We have organized the discussion in four sections 
― general attitudes toward sustainability, current 
and future purchasing habits, willingness to pay 
for recycled materials, and treatment of end-of-life 
apparel. 

General attitudes toward sustainability 
in fashion
Californians are mindful of sustainability in making 
fashion choices. This has important implications for 
the feasibility of circularity. 

Californians express overwhelming support for 
“green” causes and admit their impact on purchasing 
decisions. Among the survey respondents, 80 
percent call sustainability important when selecting 
a fashion brand to buy; 81 percent say it is important 
that the fashion brands they buy use sustainably 
sourced materials; and 72 percent are more loyal 
to brands that use sustainably sourced or recycled 
materials. 

Californians who spend more on clothes or buy 
more clothes are even more inclined to make 
sustainability a factor in their purchase decisions. Of 
those Californians who spend $301-500 a month on 
clothes, 87 percent consider sustainability important 
vs. 75 percent of those who spend $0-100 on 
clothes.85 The gap is similar between groups who buy 
more vs. fewer clothes; of those who buy 11-15 items 
a month, 91 percent consider sustainability important 
vs. 77 percent of those who buy 0-1 items a month.86

Not only do we see widespread consumer interest 
in sustainability in the fashion industry, but those 
consumers who make up a disproportionate share 
of the market are most likely to value and make 
decisions based on apparel sustainability. 

Current and future purchasing habits
Consumers are also seeking ways to buy their clothes 
more sustainably. In aggregate, 61 percent of the 
survey respondents report at least sometimes buying 
clothing made with recycled materials. And, while

Source: McKinsey 2021 California Fashion Circularity Survey, n = 1,002. Questions included: Do you currently buy clothing that is made from recycled materials? In the next 
one to three years, I anticipate buying [more / less  /  same amount of] apparel made from recycled materials than I do now. How much did you spend on casual apparel in the 
past month? 

On average, younger Californians (18-34-years-old) 
report willingness to pay a premium for apparel made 
with recycled materials, while older Californians 
(55-65+) do not.88 Those 18-24-years-old report 
willingness to pay almost 15 percent more for apparel 
made with recycled materials.89 Reported willingness 
to pay a premium does not differ significantly by major 
metropolitan area or purchase volume. 

This tracks other survey results. Younger consumers 
are more likely to consider sustainability important 

more often, such as selecting a fashion brand to buy 
or considering the origin of materials in clothing.

Several factors may account for the differences in 
willingness to pay:90

 — Younger consumers may feel more strongly about 
promoting sustainability with their own actions.

 — Older consumers may have more fixed buying 
habits and be less willing to experiment with 
different products.

Willingness-to-pay analysis

Willingness to pay has historically differed between survey responses and actions in the real world. Willingness to pay is 
often overstated when the purchase under discussion can be categorized as more virtuous than the baseline ― e.g., buying 
apparel made with recycled materials is more virtuous than buying traditional apparel.87

To minimize skew, we applied a randomized controlled trial question design. We asked 50 percent of respondents about the 
price they pay for the typical jeans they like and want to buy. We then asked the other 50 percent about the price they would 
be willing to pay for jeans made of recycled material. To determine the difference in willingness to pay, we calculated and 
compared the average prices that both groups would be willing to pay.

36

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in California — Brands that market to older consumers may 

focus less on recycled materials, leaving these 
consumers less exposed to them. 

Ensuring sustainable economics for circularity would 
require making one or a combination of changes to the 
current business model:

 — Brands could charge a very slight premium for 
clothing made with recycled materials, which a 
majority of Californians seems to support.

 — Companies across the value chain could invest to 
increase scale and purchasing power, reducing 
costs for recycled material inputs and thus making  
recycled products cost-competitive with virgin-
produced products.

 — The government could consider policy 

interventions, such as taxes or subsidies.

Together, these actions would significantly strengthen 
the business case for textile circularity.

The willingness to pay a premium for apparel made 
with recycled materials differs by type of clothing. This 
has implications for efforts to accelerate circularity. 
Survey respondents who typically buy mass market 
clothing ($40-99) and value clothing (less than $40) 
are willing to pay a premium for recycled materials.91 
But those who buy “masstige” clothing ($100-249) 
are not willing to pay a premium, nor are those who 
typically buy luxury clothing (more than $250).92

Buyers of masstige and luxury clothing may associate 
recycled apparel with cheaper, lower-quality, used 
products. Educating consumers who are less willing 
to pay may require demonstrating that the positive 
environmental impact of recycled materials does not 
diminish quality and performance (Exhibit 10).

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaWhile fashion brands have opportunities to capitalize 
on some consumers’ willingness to pay for recycled 
materials, they should also consider opportunities to 
change consumer preferences by educating those 
less willing to pay.

Consumer willingness to pay further differs by type 
of recycled or sustainably sourced material. Asked to 
select the materials for which they would be willing to 
pay more, survey respondents rank recycled cotton 
in the top three 36 percent of the time and recycled 
polyester (both textile and non-textile) in the top three 
47 percent of the time, in aggregate (Exhibit 11). 

In aggregate, recycled cotton and polyester inputs 
rank significantly higher ― 47 percent for polyester 
across feedstocks (recycled plastic bottles, marine 
plastic, and textile-to-textile recycled polyester) ― 
than recycled leather, wool, and linen, but recycled 
leather is much more popular than recycled wool or 
linen. 

While the aggregate willingness to pay for polyester 
is higher than for other recycled materials, willingness 
to pay differs by type of recycled polyester feedstock. 

Recycled plastic bottles rank in the top three 20 
percent of the time, recycled marine plastic 16 
percent of the time, and textile-to-textile recycled 
polyester 12 percent of the time. 

Because polyester is the most used fiber in the 
world, informing consumers about the importance of 
buying clothing made with recycled polyester will be 
important. The industry should do further research to 
understand whether consumers really prefer specific 
types of polyester feedstock, and if so, how they 
perceive the differing environmental impact of the 
feedstock.

Recycled polyester comes from two sources ― non-
textile materials like reclaimed plastic converted into 
fibers and textile materials obtained through fiber-
to-fiber recycling. The sources produce the same 
recycled polyester fiber output.

Efforts to reduce barriers to closed-loop recycling 
may need to communicate to consumers the benefits 
of textile-to-textile recycled polyester over non-
textile recycled polyester like marine plastic and 
plastic bottles. In addition, scaling a source for

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in Californiarecycled polyester feedstock that is separate from 
recycled plastic bottles may not only help to divert 
apparel from the landfill but also avoid potential price 
increases driven by competition from consumer 
goods companies for recycled polyethylene products 
(e.g., rPET). 

Treatment of end-of-life apparel
Consumer opinions and actions on circularity at 
the end of the fashion lifecycle are critical. Today, 
45 percent of Californians do not participate in an 
apparel recycling program, and 56 percent call 
donation their primary way to dispose of apparel. 
While 14 percent say that they primarily recycle their 
clothes via a textile recycling program, 11 percent 
admit that throwing clothes away is their primary 
method of disposal. 

Exploring disposal methods for end-of-life apparel 
requires looking beyond the current habits 
of Californians in general to the habits of the 

Californians who generate the most end-of-life 
apparel. To this end, we divided the survey results on 
disposal of end-of-life apparel into groups based on 
the average number of items that respondents buy 
each month (Exhibit 12).93

In general, about the same percentages of 
respondents report throwing away their end-of-life 
apparel and recycling it. But this does not match 
the reality in California, where current landfill rates 
for clothes are 85-90 percent.94 Various factors 
may account for these disparities. For example, 
respondents may have answered based on intent, 
rather than the default action of throwing away that 
happens when people get busy, or the receiving 
organizations may have sent some of the donated 
clothes to the landfill (about 5 percent of what these 
organizations collect today).95

39

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaAdvancing circularity in California will require 
significant improvements. While only 14 percent 
of respondents report primarily recycling their 
clothes, 92 percent say that they would participate 
in a brand-sponsored apparel recycling program, if 
available (Exhibit 13). This willingness does not differ 
significantly with the type of apparel purchased 
(Exhibit 14).

Given the consumer appetite for apparel recycling, 
the question is how to build the necessary collection 
and sorting capacity. While pre-consumer waste 
raises collection and sorting issues, the sheer 
volume of post-consumer waste calls for educating 
consumers about their apparel disposal options and 
reclaiming a higher percentage of end-of-life apparel.

To accelerate recycling and improve reuse and resale 
programs that can keep apparel out of the landfill, 
consumers need education on appropriate methods 
of disposal based on the condition of clothes. Asked 
the condition of any apparel they have discarded, 
40 percent of respondents who primarily send their 
clothing to the landfill say clean; 43 percent say worn 
but wearable; 12 percent say wearable after repair; 
and more than 25 percent say like new (Exhibit 
15).96 Instead of going to the landfill, these clothes 
should go to others for reuse or to recycling facilities, 
creating a truly circular model for the apparel industry.

Efforts to establish new recycling programs should 
pay attention to consumers’ program preferences. 
Today, 70 percent of Californians who recycle or 
donate items take them to a donation center like 
Goodwill; 35 percent put them in a drop-off container; 
23 percent take them to a store for a take-back 
program; 20 percent participate in a curbside 
collection program; and 14 percent mail them via a 
collection service.97

But asked their preferred methods of recycling, 63 
percent of respondents put drop-off containers in 
their top three, followed by 47 percent citing in-store 
take-back programs and 44 percent citing donation 
centers / consignment stores. Efforts to increase 
recycling participation can start by addressing this 
gap between the vision and current practices. 

Just 31 percent of Californians consider their current 
apparel recycling methods very convenient, and 29 
percent call their current methods inconvenient or 
only slightly convenient. This is a problem, as drop-
off or shipping convenience is the most important 
factor in making respondents likely to participate 
in an apparel recycling program. 59 percent call it a 
top-three factor, along with knowing their positive 
impact on the environment (55 percent) and receiving 
discounts on new items (51 percent). This suggests 
that convenience outranks financial incentives in 
securing participation in a recycling program. 

Against the background of opportunities, challenges, 
and consumer preferences, Chapter 5 discusses the 
total holistic impact that advancing textile circularity 
in California could have and specific initiatives that 
might move the needle.

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaThis chapter summarizes the key obstacles to 
establishing closed-loop textile recycling and 
analyzes 12 potential initiatives for advancing apparel 
circularity in California, including their total holistic 
impact (economic, environmental, and social benefits) 
and costs – based on a polyester use case. These 
initiatives could generate total holistic impact for the 
state estimated at $7-9 billion.98 Expanding these 
initiatives to all other textile materials across the US 
fashion industry could generate total holistic impact 
estimated at $50-70 billion.99

Major obstacles to closed-loop recycling
Each stage of the fashion lifecycle includes 
significant obstacles to closed-loop recycling. Long 
term, the shift from a linear to a circular apparel 
economy would require addressing all these 
obstacles, but early interventions could target areas 
with the biggest infrastructure gaps today, especially 
collection, sorting, and recycling. 

Collection obstacles 
Collection channels that serve closed-loop recycling 
are highly fragmented and can accept only specific 
types of textiles (e.g., >80 percent white cotton, >80 
percent polyester, or cotton-polyester blends) ― 
typically in small amounts.100 Apparel manufacturers 
that generate pre-consumer waste would likely need 
to pay a premium for recycling relative to landfilling 
or downcycling end-of-life textiles, due primarily to 
the additional sorting and deconstruction activities 
required. Fashion brands committed to diverting 
textiles to their highest and best use often spend 
more time and effort navigating complex relationships 
with diverse stakeholders, including discount 
resellers, waste haulers, textile sorters, recyclers, and 
downcyclers.

While consumers can typically donate post-consumer 
waste for free (e.g., at a used clothing drop off), 
some survey respondents (29 percent) find existing 
collection options inconvenient or only slightly 
convenient. This is probably a key reason that they 
throw away most textile waste.101

Sorting obstacles
Sorting (including deconstruction activities) faces 
three major obstacles:102

 — Current sorters do not segregate by textile 
type. Donation centers / consignment stores 
and central facilities that process used textiles 
often sort based on quality and seasonality to 
determine if clothing can sell secondhand, but 
they rarely sort by textile type (as closed-loop 
recycling requires). The only ways to mitigate this 
gap today are to be selective in which garments 
can enter a recycling channel (e.g., accept only 
items that are >80 percent polyester) or to have 
the recyclers sort garments upon receipt.

 — The textile-to-textile recycling industry lacks 

standardized sorting guidelines and feedstock 
specifications, in part because the volume of 
textile recycling today remains small, minimizing 
the need for sophisticated sorting solutions at 
scale.

 — Deconstruction of fabrics destined for 

recycling rarely happens. Only a few sub-scale 
start-ups support deconstruction, and the 
remaining clothes end up in the landfill. Removing 
tags, buttons, zippers, and other impurities is 
labor-intensive and inefficient and will not occur 
without consistent demand and willingness to pay 
for deconstructed garments.

Recycling obstacles
Closed-loop recycling also faces three obstacles:

 — Technical barriers restrict the inputs and 

outputs of recycling facilities. All textile-to-
textile recyclers have narrow specifications for 
fabrics they can handle (e.g., fiber type, color, 
and quality), and they cannot process buttons, 
zippers, trims, and other impurities. Beyond 
a few technologies that work primarily with 
cotton-polyester blended fabrics, most recyclers 
cannot intake the blended textiles estimated to 
represent more than 50 percent of today’s fashion 
industry.103 Only chemical recycling can achieve 
virgin-quality outputs, and these breakthrough 
processes have been tested only for polyester and 
man-made cellulosic outputs.104

 — The lack of collection and sorting infrastructure 
makes the availability and cost of feedstock 
for recycling uncertain. This in turn poses a 
risk to scaling recycling capacity. Despite the 
large amount of textile waste generated, the 
volume of feedstock available for collection and 
sorting for recycling remains very uncertain. 

The textile recycling experts we interviewed 
consistently expressed uncertainty about prices 
for feedstock over the next decade. These prices 
can significantly affect costs since feedstock 
can account for ~30 percent of a recycler’s total 
operating expenses.

 — The risk of insufficient demand may discourage 
textile recyclers from scaling. Although fashion 
brands would like to procure more recycled input 
materials, textile recyclers still face challenges 
securing contracts with apparel manufacturers at 
a price that fits the economics of their business. 
Investing in a multi-million-dollar textile recycling 
facility is risky if recyclers need to secure 
customers as well as feedstock. 

To evaluate the total potential benefits from 
addressing these obstacles by achieving closed-
loop textile recycling, we developed a five-step 
methodology. 

45

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaOur methodology for defining potential solutions to achieve closed-loop textile 
recycling and evaluating their collective holistic impact

To define potential solutions to the major obstacles to closed-loop textile recycling and determine the holistic impact they could 
create ― i.e., the system-level financial and non-financial net impact (in this case, economic, environmental, and social impact) 
― we developed a five-step methodology to guide exploration:

1.  Define cost and holistic impact metrics to evaluate circularity. The cost metrics include one-time capital expenses, such as 
buildings and equipment, and recurring annual operating expenses, such as utilities, labor, transportation, and feedstock. We 
defined eight holistic impact metrics across economic, environmental, and social dimensions.

 —  The economic metrics include incremental revenue growth (e.g., from selling recycled polyester input materials or 

recycled polyester apparel at a premium) and cost savings (e.g., from process efficiencies).

 —  The environmental metrics include reductions in CO2e emissions, water use, land use, and chemical use, translated into 
dollar values based on California market values for the resource.105 For example, we valued each unit of reduction in CO2e 
emissions at $60 per metric ton of CO2e, based on the average 2030 price for one carbon offset under California’s cap-
and-trade program.106  

Recognizing that replacing virgin with recycled polyester will likely conserve land and water used in lower-cost operations in 
countries such as Bangladesh (e.g., where virgin polyester is produced and / or used in manufacturing today), we estimated 
a lower-range dollar value based on the market value of land and water in those countries.

 —  The social metrics include jobs created, based on the state’s median wages for occupations where additional jobs were 
expected, and GDP growth from jobs, based on research by the Institute for Policy Studies on the contribution of US 
minimum wage growth to economic activity.107

2.  Define potential initiatives to address major obstacles and advance circularity in California. Focusing on polyester as the 

use case, we identified core and enabling initiatives that could accelerate textile-to-textile recycling in California. 

3.  Estimate the costs and benefits of each initiative. Our top-down analysis of costs and benefits drew on diverse sources, 

including proprietary analyses, external research, and interviews with experts in apparel sales, textile collection, and chemical 
recycling. 

Given the distributed nature of environmental impact, we sized the total environmental impact of replacing virgin fiber input 
materials with recycled materials. Our methodology for sizing the total environmental impact of the closed-loop system is 
broadly consistent with the ISO 14040: 2006 methodology of the International Organization for Standardization.108 

Then, we allocated the total impact across initiatives relevant to the purchasing of recycled fibers and the collection, sorting, 
and recycling of textile waste, proportionate to their total annualized costs (i.e., run-rate operating costs and amortized capital 
costs).  

This approach to environmental impact allocation recognizes that the market prices for an item across various recycling stages 
are currently in flux. Once market prices for collected and sorted feedstock and recycled outputs were clear, the methodology 
could recalibrate to allocate total environmental impact across the closed-loop system based on market prices instead of total 
annualized costs.

4.  Compare costs and benefits for the set of initiatives. We assessed the holistic impact potentially generated as a return on 
the capital expense and recurring operating expenses required to support closed-loop recycling. We also identified which 
initiatives could be economically viable (i.e., revenue exceeds costs) and which would require external funding or cost savings 
to scale.

5.  Develop a perspective on the total holistic impact of closed-loop recycling in California and the US. Leveraging our 
estimate of total holistic impact  from closed-loop recycling of polyester in California, we applied a multiplier to generate a 
rough estimate of the holistic impact of fashion circularity across California and the US, taking all fiber types into consideration.

Rationale for focus on recycled polyester
While these initiatives focus on polyester as the use 
case, many are also relevant to other textile materials. 
We focused on recycled polyester because:

plastic bottles (instead of keeping it in a closed 
loop to produce new plastic bottles), apparel 
manufacturers could use polyester recycled from 
used textiles. 

 — Polyester is the most used fiber in the world, 

 — Polyester chemical recycling is one of the 

and demand is growing. Polyester accounts for 
~50 percent of the global fiber market (vs. ~30 
percent for cotton, the second most used fiber).110 
Demand for polyester is increasing at 3-5 percent, 
2017-2030 (vs. 0-1 percent for cotton).111

 — More than 70 brands have committed to 

increase their use of recycled polyester. These 
brands signed on to the Textile Exchange’s 
2025 Recycled Polyester Challenge that aims to 
increase recycled polyester use from 14 percent 
today to 45 percent by 2025. 

 — The fashion industry faces increased 

competition for recycled polyester made from 
plastic water bottles (rPET) because beverage 
and bottle manufacturers have also committed to 
using more recycled content in their products.112 
Rather than competing for increasingly cost-
prohibitive rPET material downcycled from 

most promising textile-to-textile recycling 
technologies with scaling potential. 
Depolymerization technologies have been 
commercialized successfully, and multiple 
chemical recyclers have developed processes 
to clean and purify polyester waste.113 A few US 
chemical recyclers can process both 100 percent 
pure polyester and some blended textiles (e.g., 
cotton-polyester). 

These factors make recycled polyester a compelling 
initial focus for scaling textile circularity in California, 
but microplastics pollution remains a key issue. Both 
virgin and recycled polyester sheds microplastics that 
pollute major water bodies and interfere with organic 
functions. These negative effects would require action 
to ensure net positive environmental impact in using 
recycled polyester. 

47

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaPolyester is just one of the many fiber types that 
stand to play a role in closed-loop recycling. Future 
research should assess the costs and holistic impact 
of other fiber types, especially recycled cotton and 
certain man-made cellulosic fibers.

Focus on eight core initiatives
Of the 12 initiatives, the eight core initiatives 
described below offer the greatest potential for 
advancing fashion circularity in California. We 
identified these initiatives in consultation with 
more than 30 experts in the fashion and waste 
management industries. 

Fashion circularity cannot happen without willingness 
to purchase recycled, instead of virgin, input materials 
and apparel and development of increased collection, 
sorting, and recycling capacity. The eight core 
initiatives meet these minimum requirements. 

1.   Purchase recycled polyester to replace virgin 
polyester in apparel. Fashion brands or apparel 
manufacturers might have to pay an incremental 
premium to procure recycled polyester input 
materials (potentially ~25 percent on the current 
price of ~$1,400 per ton of virgin polyester), but 
other switching costs would be minimal.114 

Fashion brands would need to design apparel 
for recycling. Recycled polyester input materials 
processed down to monomers behave like virgin 
polyester input materials through the rest of 
the manufacturing process (e.g., yarn spinning, 
weaving, or knitting).

2.   Promote and sell recycled apparel to shoppers. 
Engaging consumers in fashion circularity could 
begin at the point of sale. Consumers should be 
able to see which clothing is “made with recycled 
polyester” and should have access to information 
about how fashion circularity works. Coining 
a new term for recycled polyester that meets 
high apparel standards (e.g., “re-poly” or “eco-
polyester”) could provide more formal recognition 
to the retailers who use it and help increase 
transparency and awareness for customers who 
are making purchase decisions. 

In fact, fashion brands could benefit from 
increased consumer awareness of fashion 
circularity. Our consumer survey suggests that 
value and mass market consumers in California 
(55-60 percent of survey respondents) might 
be willing to pay a premium of 2-3 percent for 
recycled clothing. Even if this stated consumer 
willingness to pay does not translate into actual 

behavior, other alternative or complementary 
levers (e.g., corporate investment and policy-
driven interventions) have the potential to achieve 
the same impact.

3.   Partner with apparel manufacturers to 

collect pre-consumer polyester waste. The 
manufacturing process generates waste, such as 
scraps and rejected apparel. According to industry 
sources, an estimated 12-30 percent of input 
materials are discarded during the production of 
garments.115

  Because pre-consumer waste is often cleaner 
and more homogenous than post-consumer 
waste, partnering with apparel manufacturers 
in California that could segregate and collect 
pre-consumer polyester waste for closed-loop 
recycling might be advantageous.116 These 
partnerships could focus initial closed-loop 
recycling efforts, but the amount of available 
waste is relatively small (~20,000 tons of 
polyester, about 8 percent of estimated total 
polyester apparel waste generated in California).117

4.   Partner with retail stores to collect pre-

consumer polyester waste. Retail stores have 
unsold goods, such as overstock and returns that 
do not sell on clearance. This source of waste is 
relatively small (5,000-10,000 tons of polyester, 
about 2-4 percent of estimated total polyester 
apparel waste generated in California) because 
most garments are diverted for low-cost resale 
or donated to employees, rather than thrown 
away.118 But after other channels have been 
exhausted, textile-to-textile recycling could offer 
an alternative end-of-life use. 

5.   Partner with existing collectors to divert 

post-consumer polyester waste that would 
otherwise be downcycled or sent abroad. Today, 
donation centers and drop-off containers collect 
most end-of-life garments that escape the landfill 
for resale and extension of their useful life. But 
80-90 percent of these garments do not sell 
off the rack in local thrift shops, making these 
channels promising sources of post-consumer 
waste. In addition, some fashion brands have 
launched programs to collect used garments from 
end-consumers via retail stores and mail.119 

6.   Scale curbside textile collection in Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, and select Bay Area counties. 
Curbside textile collection is a convenient 
option for California residents that could bolster 
collection rates, increasing the scale of closed-

loop recycling. But curbside collection is one of 
the most expensive methods per ton. Therefore, 
it has the greatest potential in metropolitan areas 
like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and select Bay 
Area counties, which are nine times more densely 
populated than the average California county.120

7.   Build a highly automated facility to sort and 
deconstruct polyester textiles. Sorting is 
necessary because each recycling process is 
designed to handle a specific type of textile waste 
(e.g., >80 percent polyester or cotton textiles). 
Textile recyclers cannot handle unsorted waste 
because even a small amount of contamination 
can damage the recycled output. Textile sorting 
in the US is not at scale today, and items are often 
not tagged with enough information to accurately 
determine their fiber type or blend. Therefore, a 
highly automated optical sorting facility offers the 
best way to meet the need for efficient, accurate, 
high-volume sorting.

The sorting facility could use state-of-the-art 
optical technology to sort textiles by fiber type 
and color and would feed collected textiles onto 
conveyor belts, where items would be scanned 
by high-powered cameras and separated by 
fiber type.121 We assume manual deconstruction 
of polyester materials destined for chemical 
recycling at the end of the sorting line.122 Finally, 

a baling machine would package sorted and 
deconstructed textiles for purchase by textile 
recyclers.

8.   Build a chemical recycling facility to process 
polyester textiles. Increasing chemical textile 
recycling capacity would be critical as it can 
produce virgin-quality recycled fibers over many 
iterations (unlike mechanical textile recycling). 
Chemical recycling would be necessary to achieve 
closed-loop textile recycling. The recycling facility 
would break down pure and blended polyester 
textile waste into monomers. Recyclers would 
remove impurities and reform the monomers 
into virgin-quality PET pellets or resin for sale to 
downstream spinners that would use the inputs to 
make polyester yarn.

Holistic impact of closed-loop recycling 
in California
We estimate closed-loop textile recycling in California 
could achieve total holistic impact of $7-9 billion a 
year (equal to 4-6 percent of the state’s 2020 gross 
domestic product from retail).123 This estimate rests 
on evaluation of the potential holistic impact of 
closed-loop recycling of pure and blended polyester 
apparel manufactured and / or worn in the state. This 
impact could reach $3.5-4.5 billion a year.124

49

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in California 
Total holistic impact 
Our analysis assumes recycling 76 percent of the pure 
and blended polyester apparel consumed in California 
(~225,000 tons of polyester) by 2030.125 We assume 
diverting 15 percent of end-of-life polyester textiles 
for repair or resale and collecting 89 percent of 
the remaining polyester textiles destined for the 
landfill (based on the 2020 recycling rate for used 
corrugated cardboard, a material that has achieved a 
“gold-standard” recycling rate).126

Reaching this target could unlock $3.5-4.5 billion of 
holistic impact (Exhibit 16). Environmental benefits 
like reducing CO2e emissions and water use and 
social benefits like creating jobs and growing GDP 

could account for 30-40 percent of the total impact.127 
The economic benefits of an at-scale circular 
economy with cost-neutral recycled inputs would 
deliver the remaining 60-70 percent of the impact 
for the private sector, primarily through consumers’ 
willingness to pay, scale efficiencies, and policy-
driven interventions across the activities involved in 
selling recycled polyester apparel, sorting feedstock, 
and using recycled input materials.

interventions. We assumed that adoption would require margin improvement of at least 2-3% beyond cost neutrality. We assumed adoption by the 55% of Californians 
who say they would pay this margin as a premium for access to recycled products in the low scenario and for all Californians in the high scenario, accounting for wider 
adoption driven by technological, economic, and / or policy factors.

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaEnvironmental and social impact
The true environmental cost of polyester apparel 
production would decrease if recycled input 
materials replaced virgin input materials (Exhibit 
17). Our calculations focus on resources used in the 
production of polyester input materials (e.g., up to 
PET pellets or resin sold to yarn spinners).

Recycled polyester eliminates the need to extract 
new crude oil and the energy-intensive steps (e.g., 
steam cracking) required to transform crude oil into 
the monomers that form polyester. Relative to virgin 
polyester, recycled polyester requires less: 

 — Carbon emissions128 

 — Water use129

 — Land-use130, and

 — Chemicals use131

Building an industry to produce recycled polyester 
in California could also create an estimated 8,500-
9,000 collection, sorting, and recycling jobs.132 If 
scaled up to produce all types of recycled apparel 
materials in California, it could create 17,000-18,000 
collection, sorting, and recycling jobs, an estimated 
35% increase in the total number of jobs affiliated 
with the waste management and remediation services 
sector in the state.133

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaCost vs. holistic impact of each initiative
Unlocking the estimated $3.5-4.5 billion of annual 
holistic impact would involve new capital and 
operating expenses. We estimate that building an 
at-scale circular textiles economy for polyester 
textiles would require investing $1 billion in initial 
capital expenditures (CapEx) and allocating $1.5 
billion annually to operating expenses (OpEx).134 
This investment could fund efforts to scale 
collection, sorting, and recycling capacity and to 
create awareness and incentives for Californians to 
participate in the new ecosystem.

Relative to the cost, a circular fashion ecosystem 
could create significant value. Every $1.00 spent 
could generate ~$2.70 of net holistic impact (Exhibit 
18).135  

While annual holistic impact would exceed annual 
run-rate operating expenses for each initiative, the 
initiatives would generate revenue and cost savings 
unevenly.136 Only some stakeholders would profit in 

a nascent circular economy. For example, fashion 
brands might cover incremental procurement and 
marketing costs by selling recycled garments at a 
premium that reflects their environmental and social 
benefits. Similarly, chemical textile recycling at 
scale could turn a profit by securing feedstock and 
customers.

But, while recycling at scale might be profitable, 
current feedstock prices would not compensate 
waste haulers, collectors, and sorters for the costs of 
scaling their operations. This issue is critical because 
having sufficient feedstock for closed-loop recycling 
requires having ample collection and sorting capacity 
to handle textile waste. 

Cost implications for core initiatives
Three core initiatives (#1, 2, and 8) could be self-
sustaining in the long term, but the other five (#3, 4, 
5, 6, and 7) face challenges and would likely require 
additional external funding or incremental cost 
reduction to succeed (Exhibit 19).

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaSelf-sustaining core initiatives

1. Purchase recycled polyester to replace virgin 
polyester in apparel. Fashion brands can expect 
to pay a premium for recycled polyester for the 
foreseeable future. Replacing ~225,000 tons of 
virgin polyester with recycled polyester could cost an 
additional $75-80 million a year.137 While this initiative 
does not look profitable on its own, selling recycled 
apparel to shoppers at a premium could have net 
positive profit impact for brands, as the description of 
the next initiative details.

2. Promote and sell recycled apparel to shoppers. 
Fashion brands could promote closed-loop recycling 
to shoppers to encourage participation in the circular 
ecosystem. These marketing efforts could cost ~$135 
million a year but could help capture at least some 
of the premium of 2-3 percent for recycled apparel 
reported in the willingness-to-pay section of our 
survey.138 That premium, together with technological, 
economic, and policy factors, could generate 

incremental revenue of $1.9-2.2 billion that would 
more than compensate for additional procurement 
and marketing expenses, making the economic case 
for closing the loop.139

8. Build a chemical recycling facility in California 
to process polyester textiles. A large-scale 
(~225,000-ton throughput) chemical recycling 
facility might require total capital expenses of $560-
570 million for the facilities and equipment needed 
to break down, purify, and reconstruct polyester. 
Operating expenses might total ~$135 million a 
year, including utilities, feedstock, labor, and other 
recurring expenses.140 Compared with expected 
revenues of ~$390 million a year, large-scale facilities 
could be profitable, with relatively short payback 
periods (less than three years) for the upfront capital 
investment. But to achieve these economies of scale, 
investors and textile recyclers would require sufficient 
feedstock and secure demand for recycled outputs.

Challenged core initiatives

3. Partner with apparel manufacturers to collect 
pre-consumer polyester waste and 4. Partner with 
retail stores to collect pre-consumer polyester 
waste. Annual run rate operating expenses for pre-
consumer waste collection could be $6-7 million, 
including labor and transportation costs incurred 
to obtain ~11,000 tons of polyester waste from 
apparel manufacturers and ~4,000 tons of polyester 
from retail stores.141 These costs would exceed 
the expected revenues of ~$2 million from selling 
collected textiles, based on current feedstock prices 
that textile recyclers are willing to pay.

Therefore, apparel manufacturers and retail stores 
might require additional incentives to collect pre-
consumer waste ― such as higher feedstock prices, 
externally funded transportation, or perceived brand 
value (e.g., an environment-friendly brand identity).

Initial recycling efforts might focus on pre-consumer 
collection because pre-consumer waste is often 
easier and thus more cost-effective to process 
than post-consumer waste. However, because pre-
consumer waste accounts for only 10-12 percent of 
total textile waste, expanding post-consumer waste 
collection would also be necessary to achieve closed-
loop recycling at scale in California.

5. Partner with existing collectors to divert post-
consumer polyester waste that would otherwise be 
downcycled or sent abroad. Post-consumer textile 

waste is the largest source of feedstock in California. 
But the 10-15 percent of textile waste collected 
today is scattered across channels, with 85-90 
percent going to the landfill, so alternative collection 
must ramp up dramatically to improve closed-loop 
recycling rates.

Annual operating expenses required to scale 
collection channels to ~135,000 tons a year might 
amount to $275 million a year.142 This does not 
include additional capital expenses, but additional 
infrastructure might be needed to collect, haul, and 
pre-sort textile waste (e.g., waste hauling vehicles, 
collection locations, and distribution centers).

Current feedstock prices do not compensate for 
the labor and transportation required to collect 
post-consumer waste.143 Selling collected textiles to 
downstream textile sorters and recyclers at current 
feedstock prices would generate estimated revenue 
of $35-40 million.144 This implies a system-level 
revenue shortfall of $240-245 million just to break 
even on costs. 

This shortfall might be even greater if collectors 
considered the potential opportunity costs of selling 
to a downcycler or textile recycler vs. an international 
wholesaler. If other stakeholders in the marketplace 
were willing to pay more for collected textiles, 
securing feedstock for closed-loop recycling might 
prove difficult.

54

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in California6. Scale curbside textile collection in Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, and select Bay Area counties. 
The future circular ecosystem could tap multiple 
collection channels to consolidate textile waste. In 
addition to the collectors’ channels used in California 
today, incremental curbside textile collection might 
offer convenience. Curbside collection would be most 
viable in densely populated urban areas because it 
requires significant scale to justify the costs of door-
to-door collection.

New York City’s Department of Sanitation, for 
example, launched a partnership with the non-profit 
Housing Works in 2011 to install bins for free curbside 
textile collection at commercial buildings, schools, 
and apartment buildings with ten or more units.145 As 
of 2018, the program saw more than 13 million pounds 
of textile materials recycled.146

Two of California’s most densely populated areas, 
Los Angeles, San Francisco, and select Bay Area 
counties, might be candidates for curbside textile 
recycling at scale.147

Potential revenues from selling collected textiles 
would not cover the costs of collection. The operating 
expenses for curbside textile collection available 
to the 5.9 million households in Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, and select Bay Area counties alone would 
be an estimated $310 million a year (collecting a 
maximum estimated volume of ~95,000 tons of waste 
per year, equal to 30-35 percent of all polyester 
apparel waste generated in California).148

In addition to operating expenses for labor and 
transportation, this initiative might involve a one-time 
cost of $275 million to provide textile-specific bins 
to participants. Capital expenses could increase 
further if additional waste hauling vehicles or transfer 
stations were needed to collect and consolidate 
textile waste. Potential revenues might reach $30 
million, based on current feedstock prices.

7. Build a highly automated facility in California to 
sort and deconstruct polyester textiles. Building 
an automated sorting facility would require an initial 
capital investment of ~$160 million.149 Because 
optical sorting is highly efficient, the annual operating 
expenses might be much lower ― $20 million for 
sorting, plus $40 million for manual deconstruction.150 
But annual expected revenues of ~$45 million, based 
on estimated feedstock prices for sorted textiles, 
would be insufficient to justify the investment. 151

Potential strategies to address challenged 
initiatives
If the five challenged initiatives did not receive 
external funding or find ways to reduce costs, 
the entire $3.5-4.5 billion of holistic impact from 
advancing polyester closed-loop recycling might be 
at risk.

We explored three potential ways to avoid this 
eventuality. Together, they could make the business 
model for closed-loop recycling work for collectors 
and sorters:

 — Consumer fees ― for example, having waste 
generators pay for recycling as a service that 
would generate revenue for collectors on top 
of the sale of collected materials; charging 
households and businesses for curbside recycling, 
similar to programs already in place for other 
materials like paper and plastic; collecting and 
sorting other recyclable materials in addition to 
textiles

 — Public funding or subsidies ― for example, 
accessing financial assistance, such as grants 
or other public incentives, to cover ongoing 
operating costs152

 — Business model innovation ― for example, 
integrating vertically with other players in the 
value chain to spread costs (e.g., collection 
and sorting entity); tapping volunteers to lower 
labor costs; leveraging existing supply trucks to 
consolidate waste at low incremental cost.153

Public funding or subsidies provided to the 
challenged initiatives could decline gradually, 
potentially without negative impact on the sector, 
as the market scaled and stabilized. For example, if 
mass market consumers were eventually willing to 
pay a premium for recycled apparel and / or at-scale 
recycling involved lower manufacturing cost than 
production of traditional virgin materials, the price 
difference might flow through the value chain to 
compensate collectors, sorters, and recyclers for 
their critical contributions to closed-loop recycling 
(similar to the fair-trade business used by some coffee 
producers).

Feedstock prices would probably increase, reflecting 
the value and end-of-life potential of textile waste.154 
In addition, likely learning rate efficiencies (typically 
5-25 percent for each doubling of total cumulative 
production in manufacturing industries) would 
further reduce production costs as technologies and 
processes matured.155 

55

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in CaliforniaGetting started
To start to unlock the total potential holistic impact 
of closed-loop recycling through the eight core 
initiatives that we have proposed, players across the 
apparel industry should act in tandem on three fronts:

 — Expand textile collection to ensure convenient 
options for diverting pre- and post-consumer 
apparel waste from the landfill. 

centers and consignment stores, municipalities, and 
California residents all have roles to play in textile 
collection.

Sorters could sort textiles manually until automated 
technologies scaled up. Waste haulers and reverse 
logistics platforms could partner in the new circular 
ecosystem to increase the capacity and efficiency of 
collecting end-of-life apparel.

Retailers could establish internal collection 
channels for pre-consumer waste ― textile 
scraps from manufacturing facilities and / or 
deadstock from distribution centers and retail 
stores. Retailers could expand the collection 
of post-consumer waste by encouraging and 
increasing the convenience of donating end-of-
life garments (vs. relegating them to the landfill) 
― for example, by offering exclusive promotions 
or take-back programs. 

Donation centers could divert used clothing from 
downcycling, and municipalities could provide 
textile-specific collection bins to homes and 
businesses. Once collected, textile waste would 
require efficient consolidation for downstream 
sorting and recycling.

 — Expand capacity to sort and deconstruct 

textiles and, ultimately, produce high-quality 
recycling feedstock at scale. To enhance 
efficiency, apparel manufacturers could 
collaborate with textile collectors and sorters 
― for example, tagging garments with digital 
product IDs (e.g., RFID or watermark) to identify 
their material composition, making sorting more 
accurate and efficient.

 — Scale chemical recycling capacity to transform 
large amounts of textile waste into virgin-quality 
recycled input materials for manufacture into new 
apparel. Current technologies can chemically 
recycle polyester, man-made cellulosic fibers, and 
cotton ― fibers that account for over 80 percent 
of all apparel.156

Efforts to get started could follow multiple paths and 
forge various partnerships. Fashion brands, donation 

Early buyers of recycled outputs might range from 
fashion brands designing new recycled apparel lines 
to makers of furniture or autos looking to incorporate 
more recycled input materials into their products (e.g., 
Audi, Ford, and others have expressed interest in 
using recycled materials in seats, carpeting, and floor 
mats in their vehicles).157

Apparel circularity is a multi-dimensional issue that 
warrants broader action and further study. While 
this report focuses on closed-loop recycling of 
polyester apparel, the fashion industry could add 
value by embracing other dimensions of circularity, 
such as reducing consumption, reusing and repairing 
garments, exploring additional products like footwear, 
and incorporating other fiber types. 

This research rests on interviews, surveys, and 
theoretical estimates of costs and benefits, focused 
primarily on building a closed-loop recycling 
ecosystem for polyester apparel in California. 
Researchers could apply the methodology to other 
fiber types or geographies. Real-world data from 
pilot programs or field research could enhance the 
findings by providing granular insights into product-
level demand signals, CapEx and OpEx data points 
(for evaluation across geographies), and examples of 
scale effects.

The sizing of holistic impact might expand to account 
for additional sources of environmental and social 
impact, such as reducing methane emissions from 
apparel waste in the landfill, increasing economic 
inclusion by creating equitable jobs, and retaining 
talent by building a purpose-driven California fashion 
industry.158 Further efforts might refine the valuation 
of non-financial impact by doing more research to 
understand the true benefit to society. 

56

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in California 
 
Today’s fashion industry is unsustainable. In 
California, more than 97 percent of the materials 
used in apparel manufacturing are virgin materials. 
Some 500,000 tons of textile waste go to the landfill, 
and that number will only grow as apparel demand 
increases.

Establishing a circular apparel industry in California 
by building closed-loop recycling capacity could 
unlock $7-9 billion in total economic, environmental, 
and social impact. California could realize $2.70 in 
holistic impact for every $1.00 spent.

initiatives described in this report would meet these 
minimum requirements and significantly advance 
fashion circularity in California.

While building a closed loop for apparel in California 
would take some external support and industry 
innovation, the effort promises tangible and 
intangible benefits that would have positive impact 
on all Californians. Success in California, and beyond, 
would require commitment to circularity, bold action, 
and resolve from stakeholders across the fashion 
lifecycle.

But achieving such results would require developing 
collection, sorting, and recycling capacity to enable 
production of recycled input materials. The eight core 

Success would ultimately 
require a commitment to 
circularity, bold action, and 
resolve from stakeholders 
across the fashion lifecycle.

more fiber types combined together.159

Chemical cotton / cellulose recycling: Dissolving natural 
cotton or cellulosic textile with a solvent to break the textile 
down into a cellulose pulp and then regenerating the pulp into 
man-made cellulosic fibers via the viscose process.160 

Chemical polyester recycling: Using chemically induced 
reactions to break down PET plastic or polyester textiles into 
building block molecules known as monomers, such as purified 
terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, then using the purified 
PET monomers to make new PET pellets or resin.161

Chemical recycling: Method of recycling that uses chemical 
processes to break down pure and blended textiles (e.g., 
cotton, polyester) into their basic components and then 
repolymerizes them into virgin-quality recycled input 
materials.162

Circularity: Infrastructure and processes meant to ensure 
that inputs are safe (do not include toxic substances, recycled 
or renewable); products remain in use longer; products are 
recyclable and recycled into inputs for the value chain.163

Closed-loop recycling: Process that recycles pre- and post-
consumer waste to supply materials used to manufacture new 
versions of the original items.164 Closed-loop recycling differs 
from the broader sustainable manufacturing. Sustainability 
includes dimensions, such as low intensity of secondary input 
(power, water, chemicals) not included in closed-loop recycling. 

Cotton: A natural fiber made from the tropical plants of the 
mallow family valued for its soft tactile feel and white color, 
which is easy to dye.165

Deadstock: Unsellable and unused inventory, including 
damaged or incorrectly produced items.166 Overstock can be 
considered a subset of deadstock.

Downcycling: Also known as cascading, process of recycling 
that yields a product of lower value or functionality than the 
original item,167 such as recycling apparel into insulation or 
mattress stuffing.

Man-made cellulosic fibers: Fibers made from the dissolved 
wood pulp, or cellulose, of trees or other plants.168 Examples 
include viscose, lyocell, acetate, and modal.

Mechanical cotton recycling: Cutting, shredding, and pulling 
cotton apart into fibers, carding the fibers, and re-spinning 
them. Some virgin cotton is often added to improve quality.169 

Mechanical polyester recycling: Shredding polyester into 
flakes, pressing them into PET pellets, and melting and then 
extruding the pellets to create recycled polyester fiber.170 

Mechanical recycling: Method of recycling that transforms 
end-of-life materials into secondary materials without changing 
their basic chemical composition. Mechanical recycling is 
suitable only for pure fabrics, such as 100 percent cotton or 
100 percent polyester apparel. Methods employed include 
shredding and carding of natural fabrics and shredding, 
melting, and extruding of plastic fibers.171 

Overstock: An excessively large inventory of goods; more 
goods than demanded or needed.172 

Polyester: Fiber derived from chemical reactions with crude 
oil, air, and water. Polyester input materials can be melted and 
reformed or broken down into basic chemical building blocks 
(monomers). Polyester is made by melting PET pellets and 
forcing the melted substance through small holes (extrusion) to 
create fibers.173

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET): The chemical name for 
polyester. PET is a clear, strong, lightweight plastic used in 
packaging or extruded to form synthetic polyester fibers.

adds value, yielding a product of equal or higher value than the 
original item, such as processing factory scraps of polyester 
fabric back into polyester fiber used to make new garments.177

Virgin material: Previously unused input materials that require 
extracting new resources to produce, such as virgin polyester 
made from crude-oil derivatives.178

Some reasons for the actual vs. reported behavior gap could include social desirability and conformity, wishful thinking, and differing contexts / 
mindsets. In a study designed to compare self-reported recycling behaviors and attitudes with actual behaviors among college students, of the 89

All dollar values for estimated total holistic impact are reported in 2021 US dollars.
Holistic impact includes economic, environmental, and social benefits: CO2e emissions abatement, water use reduction, land use reduction, 
chemical use reduction, job creation, GDP from job creation, revenue growth, and cost savings, and the $50-70 billion potential holistic impact for 
the US are based on the sizing for the polyester use case in California. Since polyester apparel accounts for an estimated 49 percent of all apparel, 
an estimated multiplier of two can be used to roughly size the total holistic impact for California of switching from virgin to recycled apparel for all 
fiber types (e.g., polyester, cotton, man-made cellulosic fibers), which would be an estimated $7-9 billion. Next, since California’s retail industry 
accounts for ~13 percent of US gross domestic product, an estimated multiplier of seven to eight can be used to roughly size the holistic impact 
in the US for switching from virgin to recycled apparel for all fiber types: Sources: “Preferred fiber and materials market report,” 2021; “How

108  According to ISO 14040:2006, recycling benefits can be measured based on the reduced environmental burden of virgin raw material 

consumption and disposal. The environmental burdens of recycled versus virgin raw material consumption are measured and the difference is a 
benefit of the closed-loop system. Future research into closed-loop textile recycling could also incorporate the environmental benefits of avoiding 
landfill disposal of textile waste (e.g., methane emissions from degradation of natural fibers).

30-40 percent range accounts for the different potential market values of land and water, which depend on whether California land prices or 
low-cost country land prices are used to convert land-use reduction into a dollar value. We recognize that the actual geographies where land is 
conserved could vary depending on where virgin raw materials are produced.

127 

128  Estimated carbon emissions in the production of virgin polyester raw materials measured around 2-4 kg CO2e per kg of virgin polyester, versus 

0.5-2 kg CO2e per kg for recycled polyester. Virgin polyester produces carbon emissions from the energy required to extract crude oil, transforms 
it into naphtha, uses a steam cracker to produce monomers, and polymerizes the monomers. Recycled polyester’s carbon emissions come from 
the energy required to depolymerize used textiles into monomers, then repolymerize them into recycled polyester. If renewable energy is used, you 
can achieve low carbon emissions of ~0.5 kg CO2e per kg for recycled polyester; however, ~2 kg CO2e per kg of recycled polyester is more typical 
if using non-renewable energy. Based on California’s aspiration to reach 50 percent renewable energy by 2025, our sizing takes the average 
of 0.5-2 kg CO2e. The price of carbon was estimated at $62 per metric ton of CO2e based on the average of the set 2030 minimum and 2030 
maximum prices of a carbon offset under California’s cap-and-trade program: Sources: “Material snapshot: Virgin polyester,” Textile Exchange,

129  Estimated 0.06 m3 of water is consumed in the production of 1 kg of virgin polyester raw materials, versus virtually no water required to produce 
recycled polyester. The high estimated value of metered, non-residential water is based on the price of water in the Bay Area, California: ~$2.60 
per m3. Because we recognize that water savings may be realized in low-cost countries where polyester is currently produced, we also considered 
a low estimated value of water use reduction based on the price of water in low-cost countries (e.g., $0.17 per m3 of water in Dhaka, Bangladesh):

130  Estimated hectares required to produce raw materials are 0.2-1.8 hectares per ton of virgin polyester, versus 0-0.2 hectares per ton of recycled 
polyester. The figure for virgin polyester includes additional land required to extract crude oil. The high estimated value of land is based on 
the average price for undeveloped land in California: ~$8.5k per acre. Because we recognize that land savings may be realized in low-cost 
countries where polyester is currently produced, we also considered the low estimated value of land-use reduction based on the average price 
of undeveloped land in low-cost countries (e.g., $1.1-1.2 per acre in Bangladesh): Source: “Land values: 2021 summary,” US Department of 
Agriculture, August 2021.
Polyester is produced from two crude oil-derived chemicals (ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid). The main source of savings is from no longer 
needing to extract crude oil to produce these two chemicals, since recycled polyester uses existing plastic waste. The prices of ethylene glycol and 
terephthalic acid were based on proprietary 2021 data from IHS Markit: Sources: “AP-42, Ch. 6.6.2”, accessed October 2021; “Terephthalic acid

132  8,500-9,000 incremental jobs include estimated FTEs required to operate pre- and post-consumer waste collection initiatives, an automated 

sorting facility with manual deconstruction, and a chemical textile recycling facility. Post-consumer waste collection could account for ~75 percent 
of total incremental jobs due to labor requirements for material handling, transportation, and first sort. Automated sorting facility could account for 
an additional ~15 percent of total incremental jobs, mainly due to the manual deconstruction process: Source: Interviews with experts in the waste 
collection, apparel sorting, and textile recycling industries (October-December 2021).

Closing the loop: Increasing fashion circularity in California133  Since pure and blended polyester apparel accounts for an estimated 49 percent of all apparel, an estimated multiplier of two can be used to 

roughly size the total number of incremental collection, sorting, and recycling jobs that could be created to produce all types of recycled apparel 
materials in California. This would assume that the ratio of incremental FTEs to tons of produced recycled apparel materials would remain the same 
across all material types (e.g., polyester, cotton, man-made cellulosic fibers). Growth in number of jobs affiliated with the waste management and 
remediation services sector in California based on a May 2020 estimate of 51,400 jobs involved in waste collection, waste treatment and disposal, 
and remediation and other waste management services: Sources: “Preferred fiber and materials market report,” 2021; “How much does garment 
industry actually waste?,” 2021. “Occupational employment and wage statistics: OEWS research estimates by state and industry,” US Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, accessed March 29, 2022. 

134  Sum of the capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) estimates for each of the 12 potential initiatives to advance apparel 
circularity in California. CapEx and OpEx estimates were calculated at a high level for each individual initiative and were based on public data 
inputs and cost estimates from experts in the apparel and textile waste management industries.

135  Compares estimated total annual holistic impact with estimated total annualized cost across the set of 12 initiatives. Annualized cost is calculated 

as total capital expenses amortized linearly over the lifespan of the asset, plus annual run-rate operating expenses.

136  Annual run rate operating expenses are calculated based on the implied volume throughput necessary to collect, sort, and recycle ~225,000 tons 

of recycled polyester.

137  Annual cost is based on the current price of virgin polyester raw materials (estimated at $1,400 per US ton) and the expected price of recycled 

polyester raw materials (estimated at $1,750 per US ton, assuming a 25 percent premium over virgin polyester based on expert interviews). This 
cost difference was multiplied by the total volume procured, ~225,000 tons.

138  Based on findings from our consumer survey, which suggests that value and mass market consumers may be willing to pay a 2-3 percent premium 

for recycled clothing (see Chapter 4). 

139  Consumers’ stated willingness-to-pay a 2-3 percent premium for recycled apparel used as a proxy to estimate the total potential economic impact 

that could be created through a combination of 1) premiums paid by end consumers, 2) scale efficiencies, and 3) policy-driven interventions. The 
2-3 percent range is based on the percent of consumers who would theoretically be willing to pay more for recycled polyester, estimated at 55-100 
percent of California consumers.

140  CapEx and OpEx were estimated for one textile chemical recycling facility with a capacity of ~250,000 tons annual throughput and were based on 
cost and FTE estimates from experts who own, operate, or work with textile recycling companies. Methodology accounts for significant economies 
of scale; when the size of the textile chemical recycling facility is doubled, the expected increase in CapEx is only 20-40 percent according to 
experts and previous McKinsey analysis.
Costs were estimated based on the $0.20-0.40 cost per pound to transport apparel waste, plus labor costs based on the occupational profile of 
existing collection facilities. Several experts were interviewed (October-December 2021) to validate our inputs and assumptions.

141 

142  We estimate there could be a total volume of ~295,000 tons of post-consumer polyester waste generated in California in 2030, ~225,000 of 
which could be collected if 76 percent of polyester waste sent to the landfill today were diverted for closed-loop recycling instead. Our model 
calculates costs if 135,000 tons of polyester waste were collected through methods such as donation centers, consignment stores, drop-off 
containers, mailed collection, and in-store brand take-back programs, and the remaining 95,000 from curbside collection. Operating expenses 
were estimated based on approximately $1.00 cost per pound to transport apparel waste, plus labor costs based on the occupational profile of 
waste hauling operations. Costs account for the collection of a total volume of end-of-life textiles greater than the ~225,000 tons of polyester 
that could be recycled; these costs also account for the assumptions that the post-consumer collection of textile waste would need to obtain more 
waste to make up for materials that are not polyester and / or polyester that cannot be recycled (e.g., due to impurities, poor condition). 
143  Current feedstock prices for unsorted textile waste were estimated at $0.10-0.20 per kg. However, international clothing wholesalers may be 

willing to pay $0.25-1.50 per kg. Without additional financial incentives, it may be more profitable for collectors to sell their textile waste overseas 
rather than to closed-loop recycling: Sources: Manufacturer, “How does the RR platform work?,” Reverse Resources, n.d., accessed 2021; 
“International Wholesale Clothing,” online marketplace on Alibaba.com, n.d., accessed December 2021 – this is a list of garments that you could 
buy and serves as a proxy for the prices an international wholesaler would pay. 

144  Assumes 80-90 percent of collected materials are sold to textile-to-textile recyclers. The remaining 10-20 percent could be sold second-hand or 

could be textiles that cannot be recycled.

Select Bay Area counties include San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, and Contra Costa counties. Curbside textile collection is also 
being rolled out at-scale in the European Union, where member states have committed to collect textiles separately by 2025 and ensure the 
collected textiles are not incinerated or landfilled: Source: “Textiles in Europe’s circular economy,” European Environmental Agency, last updated

148  Number of households estimated from 2015-2019 data from the US Census which accounts for the projected California population increase 

through 2030. It is based on the California Department of Finance’s projections.

149  Capital expenses include one-time building and engineering (e.g., HVAC and electrical) costs modeled after materials recovery facilities, plus the 

costs to install equipment for optical sorting, which are derived from a proprietary analysis.

151 

150  There are very few automated textile sorting facilities at scale today, so we used cost data for analogous materials-recovery facilities to estimate 
high-level operating expenses. These materials recovery facilities employ automated technologies to sort and bale single stream recycling waste.
Average price of sorted waste estimated at $100-300 per ton of polyester, according to textile recycling experts. However, the price of feedstock 
in the future is highly uncertain because it depends on supply / demand economics that are hard to predict as the nascent industry evolves.

153  For example, a supply truck that would otherwise drive back from the retail store to the distribution center nearly empty could be loaded with used 

garments collected in-store for a low incremental cost.

156  Breakdown of fiber type is based on the Textile Exchange (2021) report on global textile use and adjusted for California apparel waste. It is based 
on the following assumptions: 65-75 percent of total fiber output is used in apparel manufacturing, with a breakdown by fiber type of: 60-70 
percent of synthetics, 75-85 percent of cotton, 60-70 percent of man-made cellulosic fibers, 80-90 percent of other plant-based, silk, and wool, 
and 30-50 percent of down. Although 80 percent of all apparel is made predominantly from one of the three major types of fibers that can be 
chemically recycled, up to one-third could be apparel that blends fiber types (e.g., a t-shirt that is 60 percent polyester and 40 percent cotton or 
athletic wear that is 57 percent cotton, 40 percent polyester, and 3 percent elastane). There are chemical recycling processes that can handle 
cotton-polyester blends, but other blends, such as those containing elastane, cannot be processed by current technologies: Source: “Preferred
