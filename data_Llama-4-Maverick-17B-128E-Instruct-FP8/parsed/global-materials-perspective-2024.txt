Global Materials 
Perspective 2024

About this report

The Global Materials Perspective 2024 is produced by McKinsey’s Global Energy & 
Materials Practice. Building on McKinsey’s 2023 report on the materials transition, The 
net-zero materials transition: Implications for global supply chains, this report explores 
materials demand across three energy transition scenarios (differentiated by the speed of 
the transition) as well as two supply scenarios (based on asset level insights) modeled by 
McKinsey Metal&MineSpans, and aims to provide insights into the changing availability, 
affordability, and sustainability of materials critical to the energy transition.

While the materials industry spans a broad range of subindustries—including metals and 
mining, building materials (concrete and cement, glass, and others), plastics, and pulp 
and paper—this report primarily focuses on metals and mining, a subindustry that can be 
categorized loosely along the following long-term demand trends driven by the energy 
transition: 

1.  Materials for which demand is only to a small extent driven by the speed of the energy 
transition and which are consequently trending more or less in line with the growth of 
global GDP and the middle class (for example, steel and aluminum)

2.  Materials for which demand is largely and positively impacted by the energy transition 

because they are embedded to a greater extent in one or several low-carbon 
technologies compared with conventional technologies, and are therefore frequently 
growing faster than in the previous decade (for example, copper, lithium, and rare earth 
elements [REEs])

3.  Materials for which demand is largely and negatively impacted by the energy transition 
because they are fundamental to conventional technologies, which are gradually being 
phased out (the prime example here is thermal coal)

The Global Materials Perspective 2024 encompasses all these categories but primarily 
illustrates trends for those materials, such as battery materials, that are critical for the at-
scale deployment of low-carbon technologies, and that are collectively referred to as “energy 
transition materials” throughout this report.

The supply scenarios explored in this publication 
are based on our research on the maturity and 
likelihood of individual projects in the metals and 
mining industry. The research is anchored in our 
Metal&MineSpans database, which contains more 
than 11,000 assets across more than 130 countries. 
Recycled materials are included in the supply 
scenarios, based on assumptions about average 
end product lifetimes and collection and recovery 
rates. Concretely, the findings in this report are 
based on the following two scenarios: 

• 

• 

The base-case scenario includes all operating 
assets (corrected for depletion where relevant) 
and projects currently under construction. It 
also includes projects for which a feasibility 
study has been conducted and financing 
secured as well as projects for which a 
feasibility study is currently being conducted.
The high-case scenario includes the 
previous cases as well as projects for which a 
prefeasibility study has been initiated. Projects 
that have been announced but have not yet 
initiated a prefeasibility study are not included 
in the forecasts.

Supply scenarios are based only on announced 
projects to the extent they are available in the public 
domain, and do not include theoretical capacity 
increases.

4          Global Materials Perspective 2024

McKinsey’s Global Energy Perspective 2024, which 
was released alongside this report, offers a detailed 
demand outlook for 68 sectors and 78 fuels across 
a 1.5° pathway, as set out in the Paris Agreement, as 
well as three bottom-up energy transition scenarios. 

The scenarios have been redesigned this year to 
better reflect changing global conditions, including 
geopolitical challenges, increasingly complex 
supply chains, and higher inflation. Together 
they explore potential outcomes, ranging from a 
sustainable transformation—a plausible scenario 
in which sustainability becomes a global priority 
and nations coordinate toward decarbonization, 
despite the challenges—through a continuation of 
the current energy transition momentum, to slower 
evolution characterized by a fragmented response 
to decarbonization. Data for these scenarios come 
from a variety of sources, including the International 
Energy Agency (IEA), the Energy Institute, Eurostat, 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), Oxford Economics, the United Nations, the 
US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the US 
Energy Information Administration, among others. 

These bottom-up energy transition scenarios, and 
the underlying assumptions for the deployment of 
low-carbon technologies and broader economic 
development, have been employed along with 
McKinsey’s latest perspective on technology 
choices (for example, battery chemistry in electric 
vehicles) to determine the associated materials 
demand.

In the Continued Momentum scenario, nations’ 
focus on sustainability is balanced by other factors, 
including affordability and security of energy 
supply, with some emerging economies mostly 
prioritizing affordability and security of supply over 
sustainability. 

Technology and efficiency improvements largely 
follow current trends, driven by economics where 
practical constraints persist in the widespread 
adoption of low-carbon technologies. This scenario 
largely mirrors current trends and assumes they will 
continue, resulting in uneven deployment of low-
carbon technologies across technology type and 
regions. 

This scenario would fail to meet key goals of the 
Paris Agreement, creating a range of negative 
social, environmental, and economic effects.

Global Materials Perspective 2024: Foreword

The global metals and mining industry is entering a new era. Historically, the industry has 
been driven by economic growth and the development of the middle class, resulting in major 
demand for materials such as steel, aluminum, and coal. While 80 percent of the industry 
today primarily consists of five materials—steel, coal, gold, copper, and aluminum—the 
landscape is rapidly changing as a result of the energy transition. 

Indeed, the energy transition is first and foremost a physical transformation and the key 
challenges are therefore primarily physical, including the timely availability of materials 
embedded in low-carbon technologies (as detailed in McKinsey Global Institute's 2024 
report, The hard stuff: Navigating the physical realities of the energy transition). The energy 
transition is changing the materials landscape in three main ways:

• 

• 

• 

It accelerates demand growth for materials that are embedded in low-carbon 
technologies as these technologies typically require more embedded materials than their 
conventional counterparts. For example, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are typically 15 
to 20 percent heavier than comparable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.
It triggers a long-term shift of the materials demand profile as low-carbon technologies 
require a different set of energy transition materials, which is gradually increasing the 
relative importance of these materials in the overall metals and mining portfolio.
It drives a long-term reduction of thermal coal in the energy system, currently the second 
largest material in metals and mining measured by revenue (2023).

Key materials for the energy transition are crucial to achieve decarbonization in the global 
energy system—and a lack of sufficient and affordable supply would therefore risk hindering 
the at-speed deployment of crucial low-carbon technologies. This report aims to provide a 
fact base and perspective on the need to scale these materials sustainably and affordably. 
We present a view of the possible road ahead, based on data from approved, publicly 
available sources, checking this view against three energy transition scenarios differentiated 
by the speed of the transition as well as two supply scenarios modeled by McKinsey 
Metal&MineSpans and based on asset level insights.

The road ahead will inevitably bring challenges, including how to accelerate the scaling 
of supply to meet new demand patterns, how to keep materials affordable so they can 
continue to support the energy transition and fuel economic growth, and how to improve the 
sustainability of the industry. This is not simple, especially in the context of an evolving global 
policy landscape that further increases uncertainty for investors.

However, we are hopeful that the industry’s response to the energy transition also presents 
substantial business opportunities for incumbents and new entrants alike, whether from 
conscious portfolio shifts, disruptive innovation, new business models, or the next wave of 
operational and capital expenditure (capex) advances, in some cases enabled by AI.

State of the industry

Despite continued turbulence, finances were 
healthy in 2023, although the outlook for 
2024 is gloomier 

Supply is scaling faster than expected, while 
accelerated technological innovation is creating 
increasing uncertainty for demand outlooks  

Concentration of supply is increasingly 
resulting in disruptive policies to protect 
local industries

Chinese investors have actively 
ramped up their ownership of 
global mining assets

The materials industry has experienced 
strong growth since the beginning of the 
millennium, reaching approximately $8 trillion 
in revenue in 2023. EBITDA has been strong 
too, growing to $1.7 trillion in 2023—of which 
$900 billion is from the metals and mining 
industry.  Furthermore, balance sheets were 
healthy in 2023, with net debt over EBITDA 
ratios of 1.3 times—well below the through cycle 
average of 1.8 times—providing companies 
with more investment capacity. However, 2024 
has already proven  to be a more challenging 
year for the industry as overall economic 
growth slows down and the shift toward low-
carbon technologies unfolds more slowly than 
expected, both of which are putting downward 
pressure on price levels, especially for battery 
materials, such as nickel and lithium.     

Supply is scaling faster than expected for several energy 
transition materials. Comparing Metal&MineSpans' 2020 
projections of announced supply with actual production 
in 2023 shows that production for lithium and nickel 
was underestimated by nearly 20 percent. At the same 
time, demand patterns are rapidly adjusting in response 
to anticipated supply shortages. The market has seen 
increased changes from technological innovation—for 
instance, the battery chemistry mix is shifting toward 
lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP), which has grown its market 
share from 25 percent in 2021 to 40 percent in 2023. 
In addition, an increasing number of automotive OEMs 
(40 percent of the top 25 globally)1 are announcing a 
move toward electric motors less reliant on, or entirely 
free of, rare earth elements (REEs). These fast-paced 
technological developments and shifts are creating 
uncertainty for long-term demand outlooks, especially 
for those materials that are strongly dependent on the 
development of a small number of sectors, such as 
battery and magnet materials. 

The supply of ore is commonly concentrated 
in a handful of countries and largely driven by 
natural endowments. Next to that, China has 
built a global leadership position over the last 
few decades in the refining of a broad series 
of materials, often with a volume share of more 
than 50 percent. This regional concentration 
creates both risks in terms of supply chain 
disruptions and changes in competitive 
landscapes, as well as opportunities, as 
many countries enact a range of incentives 
to promote domestic supply and safeguard 
industry competitiveness. For example, Europe 
set absolute targets on self-sufficiency and 
single-country dependency on a list of more 
than 15 strategic raw materials as part of its 
Critical Raw Materials Act, while China put in 
place export controls on gallium, germanium, 
antimony, and rare earth separation and 
processing technologies, which resulted in a 
significant decrease in export volumes.2

China has long been the global leader 
in refining and is now stepping up 
its ownership in mining through 
investments in other countries. By 
capacity, Chinese investors increased 
their ownership in copper mines from 
approximately 10 percent in 2012 to 
20 percent in 2023, in part driven by 
expansion in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo; from 10 to 30 percent 
in lithium, in part driven by build-out 
of domestic lepidolite projects; and 
from 5 to 20 percent in nickel, largely 
driven by expansion in Indonesia.

Although expected supply deficits remain for several key 
materials, the gaps are closing 

Price increases would be required to incentivize sufficient 
supply to come online

Fast supply scale-up and shifting demand patterns resulted in 
smaller than expected supply shortages for several materials 
compared to our 2023 perspective.3 However, our analysis 
shows that supply shortages are still expected for several 
materials by 2035—or even earlier—most notably for copper, 
uranium, lithium, REEs, iridium, and sulfur. For materials with 
shorter project development timelines and abundant known 
resources (such as uranium and lithium), this gap is likely to be 
closed by scaling supply once the demand signal is sufficiently 
strong. For those with longer development timelines (such as 
copper and iridium), the gap may need to be closed by demand 
reduction or continued substitution toward other materials. 
And while there are increasingly strong financial and regulatory 
incentives for supply chains to increase materials circularity, 
increased circularity alone will not close the gap for energy 
transition materials.

Theoretically, there would be sufficient financing capacity in 
the industry to scale up production to meet demand, with an 
estimated $5.9 trillion in financing capacity until 2035 versus an 
expected investment need of $5.4 trillion. However, the business 
case is not always attractive enough to incentivize investment. 
As an example, based on the current project pipeline, copper 
prices would have to increase to approximately $12,000 per ton 
(an increase of 20 percent from May 2024), lithium to $19,000 
per ton (30 percent increase), and nickel to $21,000 per ton 
(5 percent increase) to incentivize sufficient supply to come 
online by 2035 (assuming a minimum internal rate of return [IRR] 
threshold of 15 percent, no disruptions to demand patterns, 
a stable project pipeline, and timely scaling of all projects). 
Scaling supply to meet demand would also require the build-out 
of around 250 to 300 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy to 
power new refineries and mines, filling approximately 340,000 
new jobs in the industry (albeit largely offset by an expected loss 
of roughly 1.25 million jobs in thermal coal), as well as building 
out logistics and freshwater infrastructure and scaling up 
equipment supply chains.

The pace of decarbonization is unfolding slower than 
required to support the goals of the Paris Agreement, given a 
disconnect between decarbonization costs and willingness-
to-pay for low-carbon materials

The materials sector is a significant contributor to global 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for around 15 
percent of global emissions (equivalent to 7 gigatons of CO2 
[GtCO₂]). Assuming business as usual, and accounting for 
large-scale decarbonization announcements (especially in the 
steel industry in Europe where it is incentivized by increasing 
carbon tax), total emissions are projected to decrease by 
close to 15 percent, reaching 6 GtCO₂ by 2035. This modest 
reduction is partially explained by the fact that the cost of “deep 
decarbonization” remains high—often entailing an increase of 
more than 30 percent in operational costs for some materials, 
especially for brown-to-green transitions. Our analysis suggests 
this cost is fundamentally disconnected from consumer 
willingness-to-pay. In fact, fewer than 15 percent of surveyed 
decision makers indicate a willingness to pay a premium of 
around 10 percent if there is a scarcity of green materials by 
2030.4

The way forward

Accelerating scale-up of supply in a sustainable manner 
requires increased collaboration and efforts to derisk 
investments

Cost and capital expenditure efficiency will become 
increasingly pivotal in securing long-term affordability and 
competitiveness 

Incremental decarbonization, wholescale innovation, 
and regulatory clarity will all be critical for accelerating 
emissions reduction

In an environment of increasing uncertainty on long-term 
demand patterns and policy shifts, various forms of collaboration 
and derisking efforts are needed to support long-term project 
competitiveness. Such efforts could include offtake agreements 
and supply contracts between customers and producers, 
increased infrastructure support and collaboration between 
peers scaling production in the same region, more efficient 
administrative processes from policymakers, and increased 
exploration programs to secure high-quality projects, thereby 
enabling continued supply growth toward 2050 as demand 
continues to grow. 

The increasing level of competitiveness and worsening quality 
of ore deposits, combined with uncertainty around long-term 
demand patterns (and therefore price levels), will require strong 
and continued focus on cost and capex efficiency, for projects to 
be economically viable in the long run. For example, the average 
project cost overshoot during the past decade was more than 30 
percent, which means getting closer to initial budget estimates 
could already create significant value and strengthen the 
business case for investors, as such, incentivizing continued 
supply scale-up. 

For brown-to-green transitions, stakeholders can consider 
stepwise, focusing on cost-effective levers, possibly combined 
with mass balancing of products focusing on those subsectors 
with the highest willingness-to-pay, and dedicating part of 
the receipts to larger-scale decarbonization programs. For 
greenfield investments, stakeholders can increase innovation 
efforts, often with support from public innovation funding such 
as the EU Innovation Fund under the EU Emissions Trading 
System (ETS), and build partnerships to derisk the business case 
such as coinvestment with customers and equipment providers. 
Finally, regulators can define clear definitions for the emissions 
threshold of low-carbon materials—given there is currently 
no standardized framework and customers have different 
expectations—while harmonizing carbon tax regulations to 
create a level playing field, such as the EU’s Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism.

McKinsey & Company

The past two to three years have posed some 
challenges for the materials industry, with high 
price volatility driven by increased supply chain 
disruptions and volatility in energy prices, among 
other factors. While the industry has experienced 
cycles of boom and bust before, these recent 
fluctuations are unprecedented in scale.  

Despite the challenges, the materials industry 
shows strong financial results over the past few 
years when compared with historical averages. 
Revenues grew by approximately $2.4 trillion (more 
than 40 percent) from 2020 to 2023, primarily 
driven by metals and mining, which grew by $1.7 
trillion (an increase of approximately 75 percent). 
During the same period, EBITDA in metals and 
mining nearly doubled, increasing from $500 billion 
to $900 billion.

Overall, balance sheets are healthy, with net debt 
over EBITDA ratios of 1.3 times—well below the 
through-cycle average of 1.8 times—providing 
companies with more investment capacity.

However, 2024 has already proven to be a more 
challenging year for the industry as overall 
economic growth slows down and the shift toward 
low-carbon technologies unfolds more slowly than 
expected, both of which are putting downward 
pressure on price levels, especially for battery 
materials, such as nickel and lithium.

In metals and mining, around 80 percent of revenues stem

The $4 trillion metals and mining industry is largely

copper, and aluminum. Of these, thermal coal and 
steel account for approximately 60 to 70 percent 
of revenues, with production volumes more than 
30 times higher than all other materials combined.5 
Gold, copper, and aluminum make up another 15 to 
20 percent.

Other materials often associated with the energy 
transition, such as battery and magnet materials, 
remain small in terms of revenue but are growing in 
sync with the shift toward low-carbon technologies.

Comparing the Metal&MineSpans' first quarter

production in 2023 shows that production for 
lithium and nickel was underestimated by nearly 20 
percent.

For lithium, the difference is driven by assets funded 
by Australian and US investors coming online 
faster than expected, as well as an unanticipated 
scale-up of lepidolite assets in China in response to 
elevated lithium prices. And for nickel, the ramp-up 
stems almost solely from integrated high-pressure 
acid leach (HPAL) laterite assets in Indonesia. This 
accelerated supply buildup—in combination with 
a slowdown in electric vehicle (EV) sales—partly 
explains recent downward price corrections and 
why some projects have been called back. 

By contrast, copper supply lags projections not only 
because of expected projects not coming online but 
also because several assets decreased production 
faster than anticipated.

Iridium

As supply has scaled up faster than expected for 
some materials, demand patterns have adjusted in 
response to anticipated supply shortages. 

For example, the chemistry mix for batteries used 
in EVs is increasingly moving away from nickel-
manganese-cobalt (NMC) to lithium-iron-phosphate 
(LFP). As another example, the share of leading 
OEMs stating they would shift toward electric 
motors that are less reliant on REEs increased from 
30 percent in 2022 to 40 percent in 2023.

These trends, however, are not consistent across 
materials. For example, the move from iridium-
intensive electrolyzers in anticipation of a potential 
iridium shortage is not yet apparent. This could 
be partially explained by the fact that hydrogen 
developers may still have flexibility to change 
electrolyzer designs at a later stage in the project 
development cycle.

Supply chains continue to be geographically concentrated
The supply of materials is commonly highly regionally concentrated, with 
A handful of regions dominate mining, while China is the leader in refining
top-three regions often controlling more than 60 percent of supply.

Supply of ore is commonly concentrated in a 
handful of countries, largely driven by natural 
endowment. In fact, the volume share of the top 
one to three producers for several materials is well 
above 60 percent of supply. In some cases, the 
largest country has an even higher volume share: 
approximately 75 percent of cobalt is mined in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and close to 70 
percent of REEs are extracted in China. 

For both refined supply and refining capacity, China 
has built a global leadership position over the past 
few decades and is the main refiner for almost all 
materials considered in this report.6

Alongside the geographical concentration of 
supply, there is also a trend of shifting ownership 
across materials. Our research shows that Chinese 
investors increased their asset ownership in mining 
of copper, lithium, and nickel over the past decade. 
No other region has consistently increased its share 
of ownership across these materials over the same 
period. 

From 2012 to 2023, Chinese ownership in copper 
nearly doubled, driven in part by expansion in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while 
European and Latin American investors saw a 
decrease in market share. In lithium, Chinese 
investors increased their market share in part by 
the development of domestic lepidolite projects. 
Finally, in nickel, the majority of Chinese investors’ 
ownership was gained over Latin America and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), with 
expansion mainly seen in Indonesia.

Countries are putting policies in place to promote domestic 
supply and safeguard industry competitiveness  
Policies will impact the global materials landscape

Highly concentrated supply has caused supply disruptions over the past few years. For 
example, nickel prices soared when Indonesia restricted exports of nickel ore in 2020, 
partially explaining why the market has started shifting away from nickel-intense batteries.7 

robustness of supply chains but also to help safeguard the competitiveness of their domestic 
industries in the years to come. 

Due to the criticality of these materials in strategically important applications, many regions 
and countries are enacting new policies—not only to increase self-sufficiency and improve the 

The following examples represent a small number of such policies. Many other countries are 
taking similar actions, and while smaller in scale, these initiatives collectively will have an 
impact on the global materials landscape. 

The US Inflation Reduction Act

Canada

The EU Critical Raw Materials 
Act

Australia 

The Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA) includes subsidies for EVs 
if a certain share of battery raw 
materials is sourced in the United 
States or a country with which 
the United States has a free 
trade agreement.  In addition, 
the IRA includes a potential 10 
percent production cost credit 
and a potential 30 percent capex 
tax credit for novel materials 
projects.8

Canada’s strategy targets 31 
critical minerals and supports 
them with a 30 percent Critical 
Mineral Exploration Tax Credit 
as well as $1.5 billion to support 
the supply chain infrastructure 
build-out and $1.5 billion to 
support recycling and advanced 
manufacturing.

The EU Critical Raw Materials 
Act (CRMA) aims to regionalize 
extraction, processing, and 
recycling for more than 15 
strategic raw materials by setting 
targets on local production 
and limiting single-country 
dependency to 65 percent for 
imports of each strategic raw 
material.

In the past year alone, export 
controls and restrictions in 
China were applied to gallium, 
germanium, graphite, antimony, 
and rare earth separation and 
processing technologies, all of 
which are critical materials for 
low-carbon technologies.

Australia’s strategy targets more 
than 30 materials, supporting 
them with loans, guarantees, and 
equity for strategically important 
projects.9 For example, the 
country has committed more than 
AU $1 billion (US $670 million) to a

Demand projections remain strong, with the majority of 
materials outpacing absolute historical growth
Demand outlook in 2023 remains strong, outpacing historical pace, notably 
The highest relative growth will come from copper and lithium
for lithium (+475 percent), nickel (+60 percent), and copper (+30 percent).

Demand projections remain strong from now until 
2035. In fact, except for steel and thermal coal, 
demand is expected to outpace absolute historical 
growth in the coming decade compared with the 
previous decade for all materials considered in 
this report, with lithium and copper in particular 
standing out. 

Nickel and REEs are also projected to grow faster 
than in the previous decade, yet outlooks for 
both have been adjusted downward compared to 
estimates from our 2023 publication as demand 
from the automotive sector is shifting away from 
high-nickel batteries and REE-intensive EV motors.

For materials where timelines for project 
development are fairly limited (in some cases less 
than five years), the supply–demand gap is likely to 
be closed by further scaling up supply once demand 
signals become strong enough. This is the case 
for uranium, for which scaling challenges depend 
mainly on the uncertain future of nuclear power as 
opposed to the scarcity of reserves or a sufficient 
number of potential projects. A similar example is 
seen in lithium, where reserves are abundant and 
mines have relatively short development timelines. 

For other materials, the supply–demand gap is less 
likely to close through the accelerated scale-up of 
supply because of long project timelines or limited 
high-quality reserves and projects. In such cases, 
given that supply and demand must match, demand 
adaptation or reduction is expected to take place to 
balance the market. The most notable example in 
this category is copper.

Capex: On a global level, $5.4 trillion is needed

although significant, does not constitute 
more than 3 percent of projected demand for

Labor: 340,000 new jobs globally could be 
needed in the industry to scale supply, while 
1.25 million jobs are at risk in the thermal coal

deployment, alongside project affordability. 

 
 
The majority of investments will still be deployed to sustain 
existing assets
The top five materials account for 80 percent of investment need

The scale-up will require investments in refineries 
and mines, though the majority of capex will be 
deployed in sustaining existing assets, particularly 
for the five primary materials: steel, thermal coal, 
gold, copper, and aluminum. The total investment 
need is estimated at a $5.4 trillion split between 
sustaining current projects (around 60 percent), 
new project development (35 percent), and 
exploration (5 percent). Out of that, the five largest 
materials account for 80 percent.

Capex requirements for projects will likely be most 
dominant in copper, nickel, and lithium (notably 
Indonesian nickel assets), which will trigger a ramp-
up of capex deployment across Asia, Latin America, 
and Sub-Saharan Africa.11

McKinsey & Company

22          Global Materials Perspective 2024

Since 2022, prices for lithium have dropped by 
approximately 80 percent to $14,500 per ton lithium 
carbonate equivalent (LCE) and prices for nickel have 
dropped by approximately 20 percent to $20,000 per 
ton.12 These decreases represent a “normalization” 
rather than a drastic shift in industry dynamics, as prices 
moved closer to typical production costs.

To incentivize sufficient supply, nickel prices would 
need to increase by around $1,000 per ton, a 5 
percent increase from current levels, assuming that 
the most economical projects would be prioritized and 
delivered on time. For lithium and copper, the pipeline of 
announced projects is smaller and the demand increase 
is higher. Therefore, a higher price increase would be 
needed to incentivize sufficient supply to meet demand. 
For copper, an approximate 20 percent increase from 
current prices would be needed, and for lithium, the 
approximate required price increase is 30 percent, 
provided all announced projects come online.

However, history has shown that the most economical 
projects are not always the first to be realized, given the 
range of barriers aside from profitability that can impact 
project execution, such as permitting delays. Moreover, 
individual projects may also have different required rates 
of return to be approved by owners and investors, which 
would in turn mean different levels of required incentive 
prices. All in all, if some of the more profitable projects 
were not to advance—whether due to barriers or higher 
return rates required—a further price increase would be 
needed to bring new supply online.

In 2023, total production emissions from the metals 
and mining industry accounted for approximately 
15 percent of global emissions. Assuming no 
external shifts, the share is estimated to decrease 
to approximately 13 percent by 2035—a 15 percent 
decline. This decrease in emissions is driven by five 
factors:

•  Changes in demand: Net impact from decreasing 
emissions from thermal coal production, offset by 
increasing emissions from other materials that will 
see demand growth.

•  Grid decarbonization: The global grid is 

• 

• 

• 

projected to decarbonize by close to 50 percent 
as the share of renewable energy increases, 
reducing emissions for those assets that are 
reliant on grid power for their operations.13
Improved circularity: The share of recycled 
materials, which have a lower carbon footprint, will 
increase, driven by higher availability of scrap and 
improved collection and recovery rates.
Efficiency improvements: Continued efficiency 
improvements estimated at 0.5 percentage point 
per annum.
Announced net-zero production: In addition to 
incremental decarbonization, there have been 
several announcements of asset-level transitions 
toward new technologies. In steel alone, 
approximately 40 Mt capacity of such transitions 
have already been announced by 2035, which 
would lower global emissions by as much as 60 
MtCO2.

Steel contributes approximately 45 percent of the 
industry’s overall CO2 emissions. However, there are 
several materials that report higher CO2 intensities 
(the CO2 generated per ton of material produced). 

Electricity is often the primary contributor to 
emissions intensity, meaning that renewable 
energy could already abate a significant portion of 
emissions at reasonable cost. Although fuel-related 
emissions can also in principle be abated, costs for 
low-carbon heating fuels, such as biofuels or green 
hydrogen, are significantly higher than natural gas.

The chemical processes for producing steel, 
aluminum, and nickel yield CO2 as a by-product. 
These emissions cannot be abated with green 
electricity or alternative fuels but instead require 
alternative production technologies or carbon 
capture.

Although technologies for “deep decarbonization” 
are available for several materials, production costs 
are expected to increase with the implementation 
of these technologies, making the implementation 
economically challenging in many cases. For 
example, to reach close to full decarbonization in 
steelmaking with hydrogen reduced iron (H-DRI) 
and renewable energy, production costs could 
increase by 30 to 40 percent, and in copper and 
lithium, production costs could increase by 10 to 20 
percent.

Our recent survey of leading industry players shows 
a limited willingness-to-pay for greener materials. 
In fact, less than 15 percent of surveyed decision 
makers indicate they would be willing to pay a 
premium of around 10 percent if there was a scarcity 
of green materials by 2030.  

However, increasing publicly announced measures 
such as the EU ETS and CBAM could significantly 
change this outlook by imposing higher costs on 
companies based on their carbon emissions. In 
response, companies might seek to either switch to 
sourcing low-carbon-footprint materials or invest in 
innovative solutions to reduce process emissions.
