Introduction

Today’s business and public-sector leaders face an economic landscape disrupted at levels that few have seen 
before and none has ever confronted as an executive. The dislocations set in motion by the COVID-19 pandemic 
conspired to accelerate inflation rates to levels not seen for decades. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—in addition to 
taking a tragic humanitarian toll—stoked inflation dynamics, sending energy prices into the upper stratosphere. 
The war in Europe also revealed vulnerabilities in global supply networks, most glaringly in energy products 
but also in grain and industrial commodities. Some of these effects emanate from geopolitical shifts, but they 
intersect and magnify pandemic-related disruptions. This crowded tableau of overlapping disruptions appears, 
moreover, in a natural environment that is in severe crisis, with no geographical region exempt.

Our times are thus being shaped by the interplay of complex disruptions, with their disparate origins and long-
term consequences. Recognizing that many familiar crisis responses are no longer effective, leaders have 
turned to resilience as the essential operative principle. They are asking: how can their organizations arrive at a 
resilient stance—alert to what is over the horizon and ready to withstand shocks? How can we protect what we 
have, adapt, and accelerate into the next reality? 

We have reached a defining leadership moment. Executives need to take a step back and rewrite the playbooks. 
As a resource in this necessary effort, McKinsey on Risk presents some of McKinsey’s latest thinking and 
recommendations on risk and resilience. Our discussions range from nuanced strategies for navigating the 
fragmented global order to a road map of large-scale risk transformations. We explored and defined the 
concept of resilience jointly with the World Economic Forum this year, at the annual Forum meeting at Davos and 
beyond. We are honored to present some of the findings here, in “Resilience for sustainable, inclusive growth,” a 
shortened version of the position paper written by the World Economic Forum and McKinsey. 

That multifaceted understanding of resilience underpins the close look we take in these pages at the special 
challenges European companies are facing right now. Also in this issue, we share perspectives on inflation risk 
and additionally discuss building more resilient supply chains. The importance of cybersecurity talent and the 
challenges of ESG—the environmental, social, and governance agenda—are dissected in dedicated, cutting-
edge articles. 

In all areas, our thinking is designed to help leaders better interpret our disrupted environment and prepare  
for the future by implementing needed change. We hope you enjoy these articles and find in them ideas worthy 
of application.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022At the 2022 annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, 
the World Economic Forum launched the Resilience 
Consortium, an initiative to gather committed 
leaders from the public and private sectors to build 
resilience globally—across regions, economies, 
and industries (see sidebar, “A call to action: The 
Resilience Consortium”). The context and objectives 
of the Resilience Consortium are explored in depth 
in “Resilience for Sustainable, Inclusive Growth,” the 
position paper created by Børge Brende, president of 
the World Economic Forum, and Bob Sternfels, global 
managing partner of McKinsey. This shorter article 
distills some of the central ideas presented in the 
longer paper.

Economies and societies are enduring several 
crises simultaneously, all of which have a major 
humanitarian impact and potentially long-lasting 
second- and third-order effects. Climate change, the 
COVID-19 pandemic, a weak recovery, the danger 
of stagflation, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine all 
pose urgent questions of societal and organizational 
resilience that cannot be adequately addressed in 
isolation. These world-shaping events overlap in 
time, magnifying their impact. Our era is increasingly 
defined by the interaction of complex disruptions, 
as they emerge from disparate origins, cross paths, 
and effect long-term consequences. Institutions 
are not fully prepared for the new reality. Many 
react separately to each disruption in all-consuming 
responses. Before they can recover, the next crisis is 
at the door.

The stakes in developing resilience as an essential 
capability are consequently high. The United 
Nations, World Economic Forum, McKinsey Global 
Institute, International Monetary Fund and other 
leading organizations estimate that the pace of 
annual GDP growth partly depends on the degree to 
which organizations and societies develop resilience. 
Growth differentials of 1 to 5 percent globally can 
be expected depending on how leaders respond 
to the many challenges, including climate change, 
the energy transition, supply chain disruptions, 
healthcare availability, and income, gender, and racial 
inequalities. Against this environment of continuous 
disruption and uncertainty, sufficient investment 
and new capabilities are required to build a new 
“resilience muscle.”

Meeting the challenges crises pose to 
sustainable, inclusive growth
The experience of past crises and disruptions has 
taught essential lessons on meeting challenges to 
sustainable, inclusive growth.

Managing disruptions defines sustainable 
growth more than managing continuity
Crises damage institutions and communities, but 
the process of rebuilding can create stronger 
foundations for future growth. The financial crisis 
and recession of the late 2000s, for example, led 
to actions by banks and regulatory changes that 
made the banking system stronger. The system has 
remained robust through subsequent economic 
disruptions. Likewise, changes introduced during 
the COVID-19 pandemic can provide new impetus 
for accelerated growth: the shift toward digitalization, 
new hybrid working models, the rethinking of supply 
chains, and the acceleration of public investments 
toward climate goals. These are the kinds of 
structural shifts that crises often force on otherwise 
recalcitrant institutions. Resilience is thus more than 
protective measures—it is also the ability to reinvent 
and innovate in response to disruptions.

Crises evolve across categories and do not have 
single-point solutions
Significant crises are not single-issue events 
confined to rigid categories. They break through 
predefined areas of expertise and responsibilities, 
gaining momentum as they grow in scope and across 
regions. The COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide 
as a public-health crisis but quickly evolved into an 
economic, social, and—in places—organizational 
crisis. The issues that trigger crises, and the public- 
and private-sector responses to these primary 
issues, have initial effects and produce secondary 
and tertiary effects. These can give rise to a new 
primary issue. To navigate these rapid interactions, 
organizations need to respond with sets of correlated 
solutions that can be adjusted as conditions evolve.

Networks hide interdependencies, accelerating 
crises (although they can also enable faster recovery)
The extent of networks within the global economy, 
societies and industries is only partly visible. In a 
disruption, hidden interdependencies can emerge, 
unexpectedly accelerating the impact. Supply chain

A call to action: The Resilience Consortium

The World Economic Forum Resilience 
Consortium comprises leaders from the 
public and private sectors committed to 
working together to build resilience globally, 
across regions, economies and industries. 
It is guided by the following objectives: 

 — Develop a common resilience 

framework for public- and private-
sector organizations that can help 
them achieve more sustainable, 
inclusive growth. The common 
resilience framework provides 
the basis for developing stronger 
institutional capabilities—the elements 
of the new resilience muscle.  

 — Develop a shared understanding 
of the drivers of resilience and a 
prioritized resilience agenda to 
align public- and private-sector 
approaches and efforts. The 
prioritized agenda can also support 
current initiatives from the perspective 
of the wider resilience framework. 

 — Identify potential public–private 

partnerships to build more resilient 
societies and economies and 
take common action to support 
sustainable, inclusive growth. 
Prioritize investments and scale 
solutions that help mitigate risks 
for future shocks. Use leadership 
positions in the public and private 
sectors to advocate for a cultural 

change in organizations and societies 
as society moves away from narrowly 
focused, short-term responses 
toward long-term value creation.  

The Resilience Consortium is committed 
to shaping a new resilience agenda based 
on adaptability and decisiveness. Now 
is the time for action, because the policy 
decisions and financial commitments made 
today will determine the future course of 
the planet, economies and societies. A 
shared, comprehensive view of resilience 
and its drivers will help policy makers 
and business leaders recognize the 
opportunities and act to lay the foundations 
of sustainable and inclusive, long-term 
global growth.

disruptions affect production, availability, and prices 
more quickly. The war in Ukraine threatens food 
security in low-income countries in the Middle East 
and North Africa. New and hidden interconnectivity 
makes systems more vulnerable. On the other hand, 
networks that provide more flexibility and reduce 
interdependencies permit a wider range of solutions 
to emerge and be shared quickly. Understanding 
networks and connections better in today’s 
environment is a key aspect of resilience.

Inadequate responses and unpreparedness can 
magnify the damage of crises
A poor response can easily magnify the damage 
directly caused by a crisis. An effective response, on 
the other hand, can significantly limit the damage. 
Decisions are crucial, and past crises have certainly 
produced their share of bad ones. Even highly 
successful organizations make decisions that, in 

hindsight, were wrong. However, few probe more 
deeply about why bad decisions are made. It 
may seem obvious, but the reason is usually that 
the decision was not well-thought-out. Under 
pressure, leaders tend to favor action that can be 
implemented quickly, eschewing a slower, more 
thoughtful course. Decisions made under pressure 
and at speed can entail unintended consequences. 
This article is part of an effort to create a resilience 
framework, which will provide space for thoughtful 
decision making. Organizations need to know when 
to move quickly, to slow down, and to test decisions 
in a given crisis with people outside of the core 
leadership network.

Crises disproportionately affect the most vulnerable
Discontinuities cut deeper in poorer countries, 
among more marginalized and vulnerable population 
segments, and in fragile and conflict-affected states.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022Inequalities in income, wealth, social mobility, health, 
access to services, and learning opportunities 
create unequal baselines for building resilience. 
In developed economies, the recovery from the 
pandemic has been supported by ample government 
stimulus spending. Low-income countries must rely 
on development assistance and emergency loans 
from international financial institutions, which can 
increase sovereign-debt vulnerability. 

Stimulus measures in richer countries also magnify 
global demand, putting further pressure on 
pandemic-disrupted supply chains. This dynamic has 
resulted in higher commodity prices and consumer 
inflation, which, in turn, have hit lower-income 
countries hardest. Other global developments, 
as positive as they are for richer countries, can 
cause hardship in poorer countries, including 
the accelerated shift to the digital economy and 
pressures to reduce carbon emissions.

Resource scarcity or refugee crises created by wars 
or climate change emphasize the crucial importance 
of inclusive growth. Exposed populations must not be 
left behind on a shared planet. The disruptions should 
be seized upon as opportunities to ramp up collective 
efforts to improve habitats, food and water security, 
public health, and social and technical infrastructure 
where these are most needed. A resilience muscle 
must ultimately serve the broader goal of sustainable, 
inclusive growth. Growth is sustainable insofar 
as it supports the health and repair of the natural 
environment; it is inclusive when it meaningfully 
improves the livelihood of wider population segments. 

Crisis preparedness goes beyond financial 
reserves and buffers
Optimal crisis preparedness includes defensive 
measures such as buffers and financial reserves but 
equally important are active response capabilities. 
These enable organizations to quickly adapt, grow 
into the new conditions, and move fast on new 
opportunities. Crises have accelerated the growth 
of the digital economy, with more organizational and 
societal buy-in for remote meetings, cloud computing, 
and digital banking. In the automotive industry, 
production of electric vehicles is expanding as 
governments set emissions targets, offer subsidies, 
and install charging infrastructure.

In the public and governmental spheres, many 
national healthcare systems and pandemic-response 
programs are overstressed; success in applying 
emergency plans has varied. The difficulties 
underscore the importance of combining defensive 
buffers (stockpiles of supplies and financial 
resources) with flexibility and less centralized 
approaches. Geopolitical crises can have serious 
implications for supply chains and energy supplies. 
Buffers provide only partial, temporary solutions. 
Response capabilities and adaptability therefore 
matter as much as preparedness. In crises, half the 
impact arises from the crisis itself, while the other half, 
good or bad, is determined by the response.

Resilience perspectives of the public 
and private sectors
Resilience is a broadly used term covering many 
aspects of organizational health and operations 
within governments and public foundations as 
well as corporations and financial institutions. The 
World Economic Forum and McKinsey endorse the 
strategic view of resilience, emphasizing the long-
term capabilities organizations and economies need 
to deal with disruptions, withstand shocks, and adapt 
as the events change over time.

Resilience failures cost. Our research suggests  
that the impact of resilience (or lack of it) on annual 
GDP growth is 1.0 to 5.0 percent globally. Amid  
the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, workforce 
attrition may have shaved 3.6 percent off growth in 
some countries. In addition, low vaccination rates  
in developing countries have reduced growth by  
1.0 percent. Beyond the pandemic, income, gender, 
and racial inequalities likely reduce growth by 
between 0.6 and 1.0 percent, while extreme weather 
events are taking 0.4 percent off the pace. On the 
other hand, success in reskilling and upskilling 
the labor force in the digitizing economy could 
increase growth by 4.5 percent annually to 2030. 
Proportionate economic improvements can be 
captured through successful responses to the major 
risks and impact drivers in each of seven resilience 
themes. Given the interconnectedness of these 
themes, the enhancements will have a varied impact by 
economy, industry, and population segment (Exhibit 1).

Business resilience
Resilient organizations and economies accelerate 
from inflection points. Crises and disruptions expose 
weaknesses, separating the resilient from the 
unprepared. Our research indicates that companies 
that may be evaluated as more resilient generated 
greater shareholder value than less resilient peers 

across the entire life cycle of the major economic 
shocks of the past two decades.1

In the world financial crisis of 2007–09, resilient 
companies generated around 20 percent more 
shareholder returns, an advantage that accelerated 
to around 50 percent in the turnaround years of 

1  Resilience in a business context was mainly measured according to margin improvement, revenue growth, and optionality (retained additional 
optional investment opportunities). These criteria proved more important than stock market performance: see Cindy Levy, Mihir Mysore, 
Kevin Sneader, and Bob Sternfels, “The emerging resilients: Achieving ‘escape velocity,’” McKinsey, October 6, 2020; and Martin Hirt, Kevin 
Laczkowski, and Mihir Mysore, “Bubbles pop, downturns stop,” McKinsey Quarterly, May 21, 2019.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 20222009–11 and 120 percent during the stable period 
of 2011–17. Two equally important dimensions 
of resilience emerged: financial strength (cash 
reserves, a flexible cost base, and profitability) and 
decisive adaptations to the business model through 
divestments and reinvestments. 

A study of the performance of 1,500 companies 
during the financial crisis revealed that 20 percent of 
companies in every sector emerged from the trough 
of the downturn a little ahead of the rest. They then 
converted that small advantage into clearly superior 
performance against peers for the next decade. 
Assumptions that the better performance resulted 
from long-entrenched advantages did not withstand 
close inspection. The resilient companies had not 
been the clear leaders before the disruption and 
most did not have preexisting businesses that the 
disruption advantaged. What the 20 percent did have 
was a self-made advantage, which they acquired by 
moving quickly and decisively in the disruption. This 

was no accident: strategies had been worked out in 
advance to protect margins (rather than revenue) or to 
buy good businesses at deflated prices and use them 
to catalyze growth as the downturn shifted to recovery. 

In the downturn and disruptions of the COVID-19  
pandemic, furthermore, resilient companies 
performed better than peers. The “resilients” 
generated 10 percent more total return to 
shareholders during the economic downturn 
of fourth quarter 2019 to second quarter 2020. 
During the period of economic recovery (second 
quarter 2020–third quarter 2021), the differential 
accelerated to 50 percent. The resilients adapted 
more flexibly in the economic slump and pivoted 
quickly to meet the resurgence in demand. They 
embraced digitized business models, organizational 
flexibility, and business portfolio changes (Exhibit 2).

 Business leaders will play a crucial role in steering 
society toward this more prosperous, sustainable and

inclusive future. The business sector drives 72 percent  
of GDP and as much as 85 percent of technology 
investment and labor productivity growth.2 

Economic and societal resilience
Similar patterns can be observed at the level of 
economies and societies, with financial measures or 
public health interventions, for example. Once the 
COVID-19 pandemic struck, countries that combined 
fiscal stimulus with effective management were able 
to stabilize local economies and protect societies. 
Many countries recovered quickly, but the pace 
varied from country to country.

While economic resilience can be measured by 
overall long-term growth, an important aspect 
considers societal resilience as a reflection of 
social, gender, and racial-ethnic inequalities. The 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) estimated the relationship 
between income inequality and GDP growth per 
capita. It found that the change over time in income 
inequality (measured as the ratio of top- to bottom-
income deciles) has a significant impact on GDP 
per capita on average across OECD countries: an 
increase in income inequality of 1 percent lowers 
overall GDP potential by 0.6 percent to 1.1 percent.3 

The World Bank measures the economic cost of 
gender inequality globally at $160.2 trillion, an 
astonishing number. The research discovered that 
women possess only 38 percent of individual wealth 
overall and less than 33 percent in low- and lower-
middle-income countries. The study emphasized that 
investments in advancing education and opportunity 
for girls and women make economic sense since 
closing the gender wealth gap is essential for 
sustainable, inclusive development.4 

Much the same can be said of wealth gaps based 
on racial inequality. In the United States, the median 
wealth of White families is ten times that of Black and 
Hispanic families, whose wealth did not essentially 
change between 1992 and 2016, a 24-year period. 

During this time, the median wealth of white families 
expanded by more than 50 percent. McKinsey’s 
research suggests that this gross disparity will cost 
the US economy trillions in lost consumption and 
investment in the next decade.5

A coordinated public- and private-sector response
Crises and disruptions require a coordinated 
response by the public and private sectors. In fact, 
the world’s most pressing crises are breaking down 
traditional divisions in how and when public and 
private organizations respond. Increasingly, business, 
economic, and societal resilience are interlinked. A 
consensus has emerged lately among leaders of both 
sectors that neither can go it alone—the world and its 
organizations are too interconnected (Exhibit 3).

A common resilience framework
The current resilience discussion is still characterized 
by differences in interpretation and opaqueness 
on objectives, measurability, and areas for action. 
Consequently, the prerequisite for a coordinated, 
systematic approach to resilience is a common 
resilience framework. Such a framework, similar 
to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
frameworks, would provide organizations with 
a common resilience language, structure, and 
objectives. It would also provide guidance on 
how to protect and enhance sustainability and 
inclusivity in an environment of more frequent crises 
and disruptions. With the framework as a basis, 
organizations can enhance their mostly reactive risk 
management practices, harness strategic thinking, 
and take a more forward-looking view.

The framework would prioritize human capacity 
above all, while recognizing essential reskilling and 
upskilling requirements. It will foster an active stance, 
an adaptive, tech-enabled supply chain, and financial 
and fiscal buffers as defensive supports. Within the 
framework, organizations can identify preventative 
actions, proactive investments, and areas to deepen 
public- and private-sector cooperation. Like ESG

frameworks, the resilience framework is designed to 
help leaders see past the immediate bottom line and 
short-term financial goals.

The resilience framework must be supported by 
assessment and measurement capabilities. These 
will allow leaders to understand and weigh the 
costs and benefits of particular resilience-building 
actions. Inaction will certainly be more costly than 
an agenda of preventive actions, but resource 
allocation needs to be linked to real and inclusive 
wealth creation, whether that is reflected in 
shareholder value, renewable energy growth, or the 
eradication of poverty. Approaches to calculating 
ROI by expected value losses can underestimate the 
extent of investment needed for true resilience. A 
more suitable approach, used by insurers and ratings 
agencies to calculate risks in a business, focuses 
on reducing the tail value at risk. Another potentially 
useful measure is to identify disruptions likely to 
occur in the next decade and calculate the ROI based 
on the overall avoided loss.

resilience will translate into sustainable business 
growth; for societies, resilience both enables 
and depends on meaningful economic growth, 
emphasizing improved quality of life, equality, and 
inclusiveness. Wealth creation becomes meaningful 
when it also elevates the standing of the most 
vulnerable and poor populations, in economies of 
all developmental stages. Without sustained social 
advancement, societies are less resilient and secure. 

Building a resilience muscle
To move beyond reactive approaches, governments 
and companies need to develop a more preventive 
position, taking a wider view of potential disruptions. 
More flexible societal, industrial, and corporate 
structures are needed to enable more effective 
responses to disruptions and changes in the 
environment. The resilience muscle will consequently 
support growth-oriented strategies: buffers become 
protection against immediate impact and challenges 
that resist more immediate answers.

Finally, the resilience framework will, by design, 
foster the cooperation of public- and private-
sector organizations in supporting sustainability 
and inclusiveness across societies. For companies, 

The resilience muscle fosters an orientation toward 
quality growth, supporting climate goals and 
inclusiveness, helping to ensure that crises do not 
widen equality gaps. An active strategy is based on

flexibility and speed, allowing organizations to take 
on more risk rather than less. The resilience muscle 
allows the enhanced response—prepare, perceive, 
propel—depicted in Exhibit 4.

Prepare
Prepare is about investing ahead of large disruptions 
to reduce the magnitude and speed of the impact. 
Three types of actions can usually be taken: 

 — Designing flexibility means investing to create 
viable alternatives in products and processes 
(for instance, by having multiple suppliers across 
several geographic regions).   

 — Building buffers means adding redundancy  
(for instance, increasing safety factors in 
products or maintaining higher stock levels for 
critical resources).  

 — Strengthening networks means building better 
solutions by relying on networks to share 
information and develop tools and capabilities 

(to counter increasingly sophisticated 
cyberthreats, for example).

Perceive
Perceive is the part of the resilience muscle that 
detects a present disruption, quickly discovers its 
extent and implications, and defines the appropriate 
response.  This is best managed when risk and 
crisis management are united within a business 
resilience framework. A planning team can build 
on the early sensing of disruptions, using scenarios 
to convert uncertainty from a long list of issues to 
categorized risks that can be acted on. The best 
scenarios consider a wide range of potential social, 
geopolitical, climate, and technological disruptions. 
Planning and scenarios should also be applied to 
supply chains, with triggers based on practical 
actions, including specific thresholds for escalation 
to senior managers or the top team. Finally, networks 
and dependencies (which are sometimes hidden) 
create new vulnerabilities. These should be included 
in pressure testing as the organization probes and 
evolves its strategies.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022Propel
Propel is the part of the resilience muscle that 
enables public- and private-sector organizations to 
move quickly, ensuring an effective response early 
in the disruption and pivoting to accelerate out of the 
disruption faster than peers. Two operational moves 
are recommended: 

 — Create cross-functional teams. A structure that 
can function in extreme uncertainty will be a 
critical component of a successful response. 

 — Cut through silos. To propel organizations 

toward recovery, the responsible teams need to 
cut through silos without destroying trust.

Seven resilience themes that are 
shaping the future
Public- and private-sector leaders taking an 
appropriately broad view of resilience encounter risks 
and challenges addressed in isolation, whether labor 
shortages, digital risks, supply chain disruptions, 
inflation, or inequality. A single-minded approach will 
tend to pass over the many interdependencies within 
our multirisk environment while failing to engage with 
the systemwide, longer-term trends driven by climate 
change, societal developments, and geopolitical 
dynamics. A model alternative to one-off approaches 
was advanced by the European Commission in its 
Recovery Plan for Europe.6 The plan emphasizes the 
interdependencies between education, healthcare, 
housing, climate change, economic growth, 
competition, and jobs, and addresses them in a 
holistic framework. The difficulties encountered in 
implementing such plans will be a measure of what it 
will take to bring along everyone in society.

The enhanced resilience agenda must take a broad 
view, addressing the specific challenges but also their 
interconnectedness. The effort must be based on the 
private and public sectors acting together to develop 
mutually reinforcing solutions. The World Economic 
Forum’s activities and initiatives addressing the 
challenges from current crises and disruptions 

can be grouped into seven resilience themes, with 
fundamental cross-cutting business, economic and 
societal implications (Exhibit 5).

Climate, food, and energy 
Climate change is triggering more frequent and 
severe droughts, flooding, and wildfires, damaging 
crop and grazing lands, and ultimately increasing 
global levels of hunger and food insecurity. The 
damage is compounded by additional shocks, 
including the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation. 
Biological diversity is threatened, with scientists 
estimating that nearly one million species of plants 
and animals are headed for extinction in the coming 
decades.7 According to the UN, undernourishment 
is on the rise, harming 9.9 percent of the world 
population in 2020 (8.4 percent in 2019). Nearly one-
third of the world’s population—2.37 billion people—
do not have access to adequate food.8 The problem 
will likely worsen due to the direct and indirect effects 
of Russia’s war in Ukraine because the two nations 
are among the world’s largest exporters of grain. 

The United Nations Climate Change Conference 
(COP26) in Glasgow in 2021 drew attention to 
global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. Research shows that on the path to net 
zero, cumulative carbon emissions to 2050 will 
have to be limited to 1,000 gigatons or less if global 
average temperatures are to remain within 2°C of 
preindustrial levels.9 This great transformation will 
be possible only through the replacement at scale 
of the global economy’s productive asset base with 
nonemissive technologies.

Companies and governments have long developed 
business cases for the low-carbon transition, including 
scenarios for various speeds, accounting also for 
inflation and extreme price volatility in energy markets. 
The shortfall to a net-zero economy remains very great. 
Yet the continual ramping up of fossil fuel exploration, 
production, and delivery will accelerate global warming 
and promote economic dependence on energy 
commodities for both producers and consumers.

People, education, and organizational resilience
A requirement for ensuring sustainable, inclusive 
growth globally is an educated population. In 2021, 
the UN estimated that one-third of young people 
were not receiving secondary education; 617 million 
youth worldwide do not have basic mathematics 
or literacy skills. As of 2016, 750 million adults 
were illiterate, two-thirds of whom were women. 
Furthermore, millions of refugee children were out of 
school completely, including nearly half the estimated 
total of 7.9 million refugee children in the care of 
the UN refugee agency.10 The UN’s education goal 
emphasizes the economic benefits of investments 
in education for all, calculating that each additional 
year of schooling adds 0.37 percent to GDP. The 
benefits of a widely educated population multiply this 
advantage for society and the economy, with better 
personal health, higher workforce productivity, and 
readiness for more highly skilled jobs.11

Healthcare
Building on the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
governments and healthcare providers can revitalize 
healthcare systems and improve the state of global 
public health. Health crisis preparation and response 
can be improved at the national and regional levels. 
Crisis protocols should be adjusted and crucial 
supplies stockpiled, for example. Improvement areas 
include government financing models for healthcare 
systems, digital innovation, distributed and virtual 
care, regulatory harmonization for new technology, 
investment in preventative care, workforce reskilling, 
and changes in incentive structures to pay for 
value-based outcomes. Healthcare professionals, 
furthermore, need governments and providers to 
improve the conditions of healthcare work. This can be 
done while building a flexible workforce of the future, 
with skills optimized for cross-country and cross-sector 
cooperation to meet demand surges during crises.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022For developing economies, resilience 
building is a form of economic  
advancement, benefiting businesses, 
government, and society while  
reducing historical vulnerabilities.

Sustainable economic development
For developing economies, resilience building is a form 
of economic advancement, benefiting businesses, 
government, and society while reducing historical 
vulnerabilities. Massive investment is needed, but 
many local projects can be completed in increments at 
a relatively low cost. Primary objectives must include 
improvements in housing, agricultural diversity and 
food supply, water infrastructure, and sewerage. 
Furthermore, due to income loss during the pandemic, 
the number of people without access to energy in 
the Global South increased. This was the first such 
increase in more than a decade and highlights the 
continued gap in energy access that must be closed.

Trade and supply chain
The effects of pandemic-related supply shocks 
continue to appear as a result of trade policy 
changes, workforce scarcity, and inflation. While 
no supply chain can be completely disruption-proof, 
governments and companies can work cooperatively 
toward flexible designs.

The solutions will likely combine several elements: 
a limited just-in-case approach with redesigned 
inventory holding; an expanded supply base, 
including diverse regions and routes; vertical 
integration where appropriate; radical transparency 
across supplier tiers; and new operating models 
and partnerships. Governments can help by 
establishing connections across segregated 
data, using accelerated regulatory approvals to 
advance adoption and innovation (such as 3-D 

printing for flexible production close to point of use). 
Collaboration and coordination by the public and 
private sectors is needed to target investment and 
avoid duplication of effort.

Digital resilience, trust, and inclusion
Many companies and financial institutions are 
sustaining operations in the COVID-19 pandemic 
through digitally enabled remote working 
arrangements. Research suggests that the digital 
economy accounts for 15 percent of global GDP today 
and could expand to 26 percent by 2040.12  Digital 
inclusivity is thus a growth imperative. Investments 
are needed in digital education, equipment, and 
infrastructure so that poorer nations and excluded 
populations can connect to and share in the prosperity 
of the digital ecosystem.

Effective, integrated cybersecurity measures are 
also needed to minimize risks and improve resilience. 
Accelerating developments in cloud computing, 
robotics, process automation, and the industrial 
Internet of Things all affect aspects of productive 
activity. Healthcare, mobility, materials sciences, 
and energy production are being reshaped and 
new vulnerabilities are emerging. Processes, plans, 
and mechanisms must be developed to ensure 
operational continuity during a cyber incident. The 
need for cyber resilience is pronounced in systemic 
critical infrastructure; sectors crucial to societal and 
economic security and stability should be prioritized 
by public institutions and private companies.

12  Ian Goldin, Robert Muggah, and Rafal Rohozinski, “The dark side of digitalization – and how to fix it,” World Economic Forum, September 23, 2020. 

Resilience for sustainable, inclusive growth

Finally, digital trust means that companies and 
governments make their own systems and data 
secure against cyberthreats using the most advanced 
approaches. Organizations need to reflect the values 
of wider society, safeguarding personal data while 
ensuring reliable services. Many companies have yet 
to discover the competitive advantage of digital trust. 
Developing and promoting digital trust can transform 
security into a value proposition. Unless users can 
trust digital systems, the advantages of the digitized 
economy will be lost.

Finance and risk capacity
The financial sector has an enormous role in building 
a resilient, sustainable future. The world economy 

demonstrated financial resilience through the 
pandemic, as companies relied on access to funding, 
including historic levels of government support. The 
importance of capital buffers at the company level 
and fiscal and monetary capacity in the public sector 
has not diminished, their extent being the subject 
of continuous debate, especially since the return 
of inflation. By far the financial sector’s greatest 
responsibility in the coming decades, and largest 
growth opportunity, is in financing the transition to a 
low-carbon future.13 Most of the investment will come 
from the private sector, with the public sector playing 
an important role in mitigating risk for renewable 
energy projects.

A defining moment: How 
Europe’s CEOs can build  
resilience to grow in today’s 
economic maelstrom

Can leaders lift their companies to the next frontier of resilience—not only to 
survive but also to thrive?

A confluence of crises and disruptions has 
darkened European skies. The energy crisis is 
already dire and could get worse. The war in Ukraine 
continues, an unabated humanitarian tragedy. 
The cost of life’s essentials has gone through the 
roof—prices in some countries have risen eightfold. 
Business signs are weakening. In July and August, 
purchasing managers’ indexes indicated contraction 
for the first time since early 2021. China, a key 
supplier and customer, is wrestling with its own 
economic problems. The effects of climate change 
are pronounced across the continent, with drought 
and extreme heat curtailing hydropower and even 
putting industrial production at risk. The energy 
crisis threatens to derail the net-zero transition. 
Semiconductor shortages, technological shortfalls, 
and labor shortages remain. The latest McKinsey 
scenarios, undertaken in partnership with Oxford 
Economics, suggest that European GDP will most 
likely contract overall in 2023 (Exhibit 1). 

How will Europe’s business leaders respond? This is a 
defining moment for a generation of executives who 
have never been tested in quite this way. Yes, today’s 
leaders have faced down the global financial crisis, 
the euro crisis, Brexit, and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
All were challenging in their own way; each crisis 
called for ingenuity, grit, and determination. Many 
business leaders met these challenges exceptionally 
well. But today they face a unique confluence of 
crises that is of another magnitude. The playbooks of 
the past will be only moderately helpful. 

Businesses need new approaches to build the 
resilience required in these decisive times, through a 
perceptive response to current challenges, foresight 
to anticipate the next round of disruptions, and 
capability for adaptation that will set the business on 
a foundation for successful growth.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022A defining leadership moment
No crisis is ever the same as the previous one; 
neither can it be managed in the same way. 
Likewise, no industry is affected the same way 
in different crises (Exhibit 2). With the exception 
of pharma, no sector showed positive returns 
throughout the pandemic and the more recent 
period of geopolitical turmoil. Moreover, in the 
current confluence of crises, the vast majority of 
companies have produced negative returns.  

Executives have reacted to each disruption 
separately but with all-consuming responses; they’re 
fighting fires. But before they can recover from one, 
the next crisis is at the door. This approach is not 
sustainable in a context of continuous disruptions. 
Leaders are now discussing resilience as the 
essential condition. How can organizations arrive at a 
resilient stance, alert to what is over the horizon and 
ready to withstand shocks and accelerate into the 
next reality?

Some think of resilience as the ability to recover 
quickly, but it is more than that. Resilience is the 
ability to deal with adversity and shocks and to 
continuously adapt and accelerate for growth. 
Consequently, truly resilient organizations bounce 
back better than before and go on to thrive in a 
hostile environment. They play defense well, and they 
also go on offense. 

This is indeed a defining leadership moment. The 
last remotely comparable moment was the energy 
crisis of the early 1970s, an event that no CEO of 
today experienced as a leader. Here are a few of the 
practices that we’ve seen leading executives use 
recently: 

1.  Don’t follow the old rules. Setting up a crisis 

task force, for example, the go-to move in past 
years, is a waste of time; it will be outmoded 
before it is up and running. Leaders need to find 
a more flexible and consequently durable stance, 
engaging the whole organization by embedding 
a crisis-resistant DNA over time.

2.  Prepare for the recession, but at the same time, 
prepare to exit it. Recessions may be shallow 
and brief; companies can accelerate through the 

downturn. This is essential: resilient organizations 
open an early lead, however small, in comparison 
with peers. This lead can be significantly widened 
during the following recovery and growth period. 
The early advantage can help companies succeed 
in the long run.

3.  Use scenarios rather than forecasting. 

Forecasting has failed to adequately capture 
many key events of recent decades, including 
slowing globalization, the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the supply chain disruption, and the return 
of inflation. Learn to plan with scenarios and 
triggers, regularly revisiting and adjusting them.

4.  Develop a resilience agenda that addresses 

burning short-term issues (for example, financial 
flows, supply chain disruptions) as well as longer-
term challenges (for example, geopolitical shifts or 
the speed of organizational adaptations). Ensure 
that resilience is measured, so progress can be 
tracked and return on resilience investments can 
be maximized.

5.  Focus on resilient growth by reviewing your 
competitive position and finding strategic 
opportunities in the current environment (such 
as acquisitions or new business-building ideas).

Exemplary moves
Leading companies are already making resilience a 
reality, defending their franchise while also accelerating 
growth through the disrupted environment. Here’s what 
they’ve done in the recent past: 

 — Restructuring the balance sheet. An automotive 
supplier wanted to achieve a particular credit 
rating, a target that required an increase in the 
amount of debt it could service under stress. 
Presenting the new capital structure to investors, 
equity analysts, and the rating agencies, the 
company was able to make an additional 
€3 billion in investable assets available to 
implement a five-year strategy.

 — Reconfiguring the supply chain. To achieve 
operational resilience, a global electronics 
manufacturer with a global production footprint 
(more than ten plants) and a large multitier

of 5,000 unique supplier and plant combinations. 
The company identified around 100 high-risk 
suppliers and then discovered that 25 percent of 
its spending was concentrated in this segment. 
By reconfiguring the supplier network, the 
company reduced the higher-risk spending by 
more than 40 percent. 

 —  Decarbonizing core assets. A global mining 
company with dozens of mines worldwide 
sought to embed ESG along its value chain 
into the core business. The company defined 
targets and adopted strategic initiatives to 
create a pathway to net-zero emissions across 
the enterprise. Detailed decarbonization plans 
were developed for each site, with steps to 
reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 percent  
by 2030. Once implemented, the plan will 
lead to large reductions in both operating and 
capital expenditures. 

 — Derisking manufacturing analytics. A global 
agriculture products leader wanted to deploy 
advanced analytics within its supply chain 
and manufacturing operations. Aware of 
the potential data and analytics risks this 
entailed, the company made derisking and 
safeguarding critical data and analytics through 
data governance and model risk management 
an integral part of the effort. The move built 
enterprise-wide confidence in analytics 
resilience and allowed the company to capture 
the full potential of the effort. 

 — Next-generation scenario planning. A leading 
automotive company created two hypothetical 
scenarios (a technological disruption and 
market breakdown), then assessed the potential 
impact on the business and the resilience 
levers that would best mitigate that effect. The 
analysis suggested that up to 60 percent of 
sales losses could be mitigated. This led to a 
decision to diversify geographically and reduce 
the risk of dependence on single sites, set up 
some anticipatory information mechanisms, 
and reduce the fixed-costs intensity in some 
production locations. 

 — Anticipating the future. A utility with annual 

costs of $5 billion was facing rising prices from 

suppliers, in particular for basic materials. To 
address cost pressures strategically, the 
utility created an “inflation nerve center,” using 
tech-enabled analytics. The center identified 
spending priorities, anticipated and quantified 
inflationary risks, created live dashboards 
showing inflationary impact, and established 
a proactive process and set of levers to 
manage inflationary pressures. This helped 
the company understand the magnitude of 
inflationary risks across its cost base using an 
analytics-driven approach.

 — Turning a crisis into a growth opportunity. A 

global pharma company addressed the recent 
disruptions in healthcare supply chains, services, 
and access to healthcare professionals. The 
company designed a home-delivery system 
to help patients with rare diseases continue 
receiving treatment in the safety of their own 
homes. They further created a partnership 
with a start-up company to provide patients 
with physical therapy programs through virtual 
channels. These innovations allocate and deploy 
resources more effectively; they also inspired 
the company to undertake a groupwide agile and 
lean organizational transformation.

Why resilience matters: What still works and 
what doesn’t
Companies cannot effectively respond to the current 
economic crisis in precisely the same way as they 
did in earlier crises. But some basic lessons can be 
drawn from past experience. McKinsey research on 
the financial crisis of 2007–08 shows that resilient 
companies not only perform better than their 
peers through a downturn and recovery—they also 
accelerate into the new reality, leaving peers further 
behind (Exhibit 3).

The research indicated that companies that win 
through resilience do three things well in a disrupted 
environment: 

1.  

 They make faster and harder moves in 
productivity, preserving growth capacity.

2.    They create more operational and financial 

optionality in their balance sheets, adjusting 
leverage or cleaning legacies.

to concentrate their forces now, over the next six 
months, and beyond. The key questions to answer are 
about response, foresight, and adaptation: 

Not only do leading companies do these three things 
well, they also do them at the most decisive time for 
their future well-being. They react in the downturn 
when it matters most and are therefore able to 
open an early lead in comparison with peers, which 
can be widened significantly during the recovery 
and  growth period. Recovery and growth periods 
following downturns are often longer than the actual 
downturn, so leading companies are well positioned 
to outperform the others in the long run. A turn in the 
cycle is a moment that requires true leadership to 
embark on either offense or defense. But the best-
performing companies don’t wait for that turn to 
finally reveal itself—or not: they act with intentionality 
and courage in the face of profound uncertainty 
about the macroeconomy.

The next frontier of resilience
Faced with overlapping disruptions and a complex 
European situation, executives need to decide where 

1.  

 Response: Do I have the right capabilities and 
am I acting on all resilience levers to respond 
adequately to the current situation? 

2.    Foresight: Can I anticipate what is going  

to happen next? 

3.    Adaptation: Am I able to adapt fast to a  

new situation?

To answer these questions, leaders must take a step 
back and apply a comprehensive resilience lens. 
Forward-looking companies have begun to structure 
their resilience agenda across the three activities—
response, foresight, and adaptation. They are further 
differentiating their response, targeting actions in the 
six dimensions of the enterprise. Whether moving to 
defend or advance, companies may pull from a large 
range of resilience levers that are tailored to their 
specific profile, industry, and starting position. With 
fast adaptation, companies can meet their longer-

for customers, employees, investors, and the  
larger community.

investment in resilience is needed and identify the 
actions that will close the gaps, defend value, and 
advance to new growth.

Let’s take a closer look at response, foresight,  
and adaptation.

Response
First things first. With severe challenges pressing, 
companies may have to address immediate gaps 
in their resilience profiles. They may face financial 
challenges such as liquidity constraints, or they may 
have to resolve disruptions in their supply chain, such 
as missing key inputs for their products. Before 
jumping into action mode, companies may take a step 
back and consider an initial resilience assessment to 
gain the needed perspectives on the six dimensions 
of institutional resilience (Exhibit 4). 

How prepared is the company to withstand repeated 
shocks and disruptions? What short-term growth 
opportunities are within reach, and what will it take 
to capture them? What changes will enable the 
company to make that crucial pivot to accelerate into 
new realities? In domain after domain, and capability 
by capability, the assessment will discover where 

As illustrated in the exhibit, each of the six resilience 
dimensions will have its own specific set of levers 
that allow a company to play offense or defense. 
For example, in digital resilience, a robust digital, 
analytics and cyberrisk framework may help to 
safeguard the company against digital failures or 
cyberattacks on the defense, while on the offense it 
may pay dividends in at-scale digital transformation 
by ensuring robust and scalable business application 
of data and analytics. 

It is essential that companies understand the 
levers available to them across the dimensions, the 
offensive or defensive capabilities, and the time 
horizon for creating impact. The specific nature of 
resilience levers and their relative importance is also 
a function of the industry a company is operating in. 

Foresight: Moving beyond targeted responses
As companies weather the storms of today, they must 
also anticipate and prepare for larger and possibly 
stranger events to come. To anticipate and respond

to crises and opportunities, scenario analysis has 
proven to be the most effective tool, as long as it 
is supported by the required data and state-of-
the-art analytics. Scenario narratives should be 
accordingly developed, stress-tested in analytics-
based simulations, and connected to early-warning 
systems based on key indicators. 

Crucial variables must be factored into the 
scenarios, including, for example, the evolution 
of semiconductor prices, energy costs, and the 
availability of critical raw materials. Management 
decisions have to be based on more than purely 
qualitative discussions. To understand the impact of 
hypothesized scenario inputs on financial outcomes 
(such as EBITDA, for example), an analytics-based 
approach can produce a reasonably accurate data-
driven fact base in a timely manner.

That is the approach taken by financial institutions in 
response to the stringent regulation (such as stress-
testing requirements) triggered by the financial 
crisis of the early 2000s. Companies can take the 
approach as a starting point, widening the scope of 
the scenarios, thinking outside the box on possible 
inputs, and increasing the depth of analytics engines 
across a large number of industries. 

It is crucial to embed such an approach—data and 
analytics–based scenario and stress-testing—into the 
ongoing strategic-planning process and management 
dialogue. This process must also be revisited regularly 
and assumptions and scenarios adjusted to the 
changing environment. This will ensure that appropriate 
mitigation and management actions will be derived on a 
regular basis. A one-time analysis will simply not suffice.

Adaptation: Not just surviving but thriving 
Foresight may help a company anticipate potential 
future outcomes through simulation and early-
warning indicators. Only so much can be predicted 
and prepared for in advance, however. This is where 
adaptation, the third key activity of resilience, comes 
in. The resilient organization is flexible, able not 
only to react but capable also of adapting to new 
situations, especially the unforeseen ones. 

conditions. To confront the toughest times, leaders 
must possess a strong, resilient mindset, acting 
as role models, communicating an entrepreneurial 
spirit, and encouraging free thinking across an agile 
organization. Leaders send the right messages, 
providing strategic clarity and acting based on early-
warning and foresight analytics. They are creating 
institutional resilience in the following five areas:

 — Speed of response. The organizational 

structure and operating model is set up in an 
agile and flexible way, to facilitate collaboration 
across teams, with a bias toward action over 
bureaucracy. Decision-making and escalation 
processes are fast, roles are clear, and decisions 
are effectively executed once made. 

 — “Owners” mindset. A strong sense of ownership 
pervades the organization. Curiosity and 
humility prevail; learning and adaptation are 
continual. Rather than avoiding challenges, 
people strive to innovate and explore new 
opportunities. The company pushes its own 
boundaries and questions the status quo and 
long-held beliefs. Individuals are empowered 
to think and develop in an entrepreneurial 
spirit, reskilling and upskilling as the business 
environment changes. Knowledge-sharing 
across the organization is encouraged, through 
cross-functional collaboration, mentorship, 
and open communication. Empowerment and 
decentralization are fostered, with only the 
most strategic decisions going to the senior 
leadership team.  

 — Workforce planning and skill set of the future. 
To execute new, adaptive strategies, the 
company will need to do some resource planning. 
Find the best people with the right skill sets and 
give them the resources they need to cope with 
present and future needs. Resilience strength 
resides in an organization’s people. Hear what 
they have to say and value their experience. Let 
them adapt to new realities, so that talent can be 
strategically reallocated as needs change. The 
positive feedback this creates will attract more 
top talent to the company.    

Adaptation to the new environment requires deep 
investment in resilience. Adaptive companies are 
able to capture growth opportunities under adverse

better position to gain market share and seek price 
premiums. In another situation, a strong, resilient 
digital backbone can help elevate companies’ 
ambitions to adopt an aggressive digital agenda to 
raise their operating model and ways of working to 
new, more competitive levels.

 — Crisis response. Clear and effective responses 

need to be activated in crises. Resilient 
companies have a well-defined and understood 
response tool kit; roles and responsibility 
are set. An effective, timely response is 
ensured by a fast-mobilizing organization. 
Leadership accountability is clearly defined 
and communicated, ensuring full alignment 
on delegation of authority and escalation 
mechanisms in the event of disruptions. Leaders 
ensure that risks are assessed at all stages 
of the value chain, and they instill resilience 
throughout business operations.

From adaptation to growth 
A company’s own resilience assessment will help 
identify areas of strong resilience, which typically will 
serve as the catalyst for a growth initiative. Resilience 
has to be measured, so that progress can be tracked 
to ensure return on resilience investments. For 
example, companies may act from a position of strong 
financial resilience with a strong balance sheet and 
liquidity positions to create room for inorganic growth 
moves, particularly when target valuations are low in 
their industry. Or in sustainability, they may leverage 
an above-peer ESG position to double down on new 
growth opportunities. This could involve deeper 
transition to greener asset and product portfolios, 
which protect them against customer attrition as 
standards continue to tighten. The result for such 
a company will be still greater differentiation—and 

The resilient company, beyond operating under 
“business as usual” scenarios, shows its mettle in 
crises and disruptions, using foresight to shift gears 
fast, swerve from danger, and then accelerate into 
new opportunity through adaptation. The enabling 
mechanisms are its agile organization design and 
decision-making structure—with clearly defined roles 
and responsibilities. Everyone should know what to 
do when storms come. Whether this moment leads 
to a turn in the business cycle or to a continuation of 
recent inflationary trends, it is a time when companies 
can make the kind of pivot through their resilience 
that strengthens their growth trajectory for the next 
several years.   

European business leaders face a deeply unsettled 
economy, with potentially existential risks for those 
companies that enter the crisis with weaknesses 
in their balance sheet and business model. We’ve 
found that most senior executives are highly 
capable of playing defense in volatile and uncertain 
environments. Protection is a must, but opportunities 
for growth are also emerging. The exceptional 
leader finds the path to the next frontier of resilience, 
answering essential questions of where to shore 
up defenses and where to place bets on the future. 
The resilience framework we’ve outlined can help 
leaders see and understand gaps and identify growth 
opportunities even in the heaviest of seas.

Using analytics to  
address inflation risks  
and strengthen  
competitive positioning

In the new inflationary environment, company leaders can protect  
their business and gain competitive advantage by deploying analytics-

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022During 2021 and 2022, consumer inflation 
accelerated in most developed and emerging 
economies. In the United States, the consumer price 
index (CPI) rose from 2.6 percent in March 2021 to 
8.5 percent in March of this year. In June, the pace 
reached 9.1 percent, the fastest in 40 years, while 
producer prices have increased faster still. In the 
eurozone, consumer inflation reached 8.6 percent in 
June 2022, its highest-ever level (exhibit). 

Investors, economists, and forecasting institutions 
expect inflation to ease, but only gradually. (July 
measurements were somewhat lower in the United 
States but higher still in the eurozone.) The return of 
inflation is linked to the pandemic—the public-health 
measures taken to contain the spread of the virus and 
the economic and fiscal measures taken to mitigate 
the disruption this caused. The Russian invasion of 
Ukraine is exacerbating the inflationary dynamics. 

Inflation accelerated in an environment of strong 
consumer demand, supply shortages, production 
shortfalls, and rising energy prices. The main 
inflation driver, energy prices, increased in Europe 

by 38 percent in April and by 45 percent in March. In 
June, the core inflation rate in the eurozone (inflation 
excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco) was 
4.2 percent, a record level but one that underscores 
the lopsided composition of the overall rate.

For many companies, a high-inflation environment  
is an unstable and insecure one to operate in. 
Responding to inflation is of paramount importance 
now, but responses must carefully account for 
future inflation, impact on the company business 
model, and the time lag for any response to manifest. 

Analytics can be used to improve decision making in a 
high-inflation environment, with the level of analytics 
sophistication determined by the business require- 
ments. In sectors where businesses are highly 
specialized and margins are thin—such as consumer 
packaged goods—analytics will need to be more 
precise to aid in developing a nuanced understanding 
of exposures. On the other hand, high-margin 
enterprises (software development or luxury goods, 
for example) can benefit from a more conceptual 
approach, without building deep analytics.

Using analytics to address inflation risks and strengthen competitive positioning

27

Companies can use a flexible,  
analytically sophisticated method  
to help determine how and when to  
react to high-inflation environments. 

Inflation forecasting is a separate and complex topic 
of its own, and in developing inflation responses, 
most organizations use forecasts and scenarios 
developed externally. Analytics for decision making, 
on the other hand, cannot be outsourced. Without 
resorting to direct inflation forecasting, companies 
can use a flexible, analytically sophisticated method 
to help determine how and when to react. The 
approach includes assessing the extent of exposure 
and breaking down the types of exposures.

Assessing the extent of inflation 
exposure with simulations and scenarios
Analytics can help companies estimate their 
exposure to inflation. Mitigation strategies can then 
be prioritized based on the estimates. To assess 
exposure, companies can associate drivers of cost—
such as commodity prices, foreign-exchange rates, 
labor costs—to actual costs. The association can be 
made in detail, potentially down to the subproduct 
level. A variety of analytical methods can produce 
simulations and scenarios for the drivers of costs. 
The estimates should be historically accurate as well 
as forward looking. The estimates should maintain 
consistency across factors: for example, the prices 
of construction commodities such as steel and 
copper tend to be correlated. 

Once companies have assessed their exposure, they 
can prioritize risk factors with the largest exposure 
and then overlay and select potential mitigation 
strategies. Proper exposure assessment requires 

capabilities for scenario analysis, stochastic 
simulations, predictive modeling, and well-
established, repeatable analytical methods.

Decomposing exposure: Pure  
inflation, relative price inflation,  
and idiosyncratic inflation
Companies are exposed to different types of 
inflation; analytics can be used to establish the 
levels of exposure to pure, relative price, and 
idiosyncratic inflation.1 Their exposure profiles 
provide a basis for tailoring mitigating actions 
to manage business in inflationary conditions. A 
number of robust methods can be employed to 
estimate the inflation breakdown repeatedly and 
accurately. Economists sometimes use a two-step 
method, for example, first separating out exposures 
to idiosyncratic inflation and then separating pure 
inflation from what remains (by estimating the 
proportion of prices that move equiproportionately).  

Matching strategies to inflation types
Depending on exposure and inflation 
decomposition, companies can use analytics to size 
and prioritize the various risk factors for inflation. 
Strategies can then be selected according to their 
efficacy in addressing the risk factors that lead to 
the greatest company exposure. Among others, 
potential strategies include hedging to reduce price 
volatility, vertical integration up the value chain, and 

1   Pure inflation refers to the equiproportional upward movement of prices; relative price inflation refers to disproportionately greater price 
increases for some goods and services compared with others; idiosyncratic inflation refers to price increases resulting from shocks and 
disruptions affecting particular regions, industries, markets, and products. See Hie Joo Ahn and Matteo Luciani, “Relative prices and pure 
inflation since the mid-1990s,“ Finance and Economics Discussion Series (FEDS), US Federal Reserve, October 2021.

pass-through pricing. The following discussions of 
hedging and pass-through pricing demonstrate how 
strategy choices depend on company position and 
inflation decomposition.

Volatility reduction through hedging: A response 
to relative price changes
Companies have long used hedging strategies to 
mitigate and manage the risk of price fluctuations 
for their businesses. To manage hedging risks, 
companies can involve different parts of the 
organization, actively managing inventory price 
risks and commercial contracts, building analytics 
capabilities such as scenario testing, and 
developing governance and policies for oversight. 
The hedging option will require the strongest 
analytical capabilities, including forecasting and 
optimization. It can often mitigate the risks of 
price fluctuations for feedstock, which mostly 
relate to relative price changes. For example, a 
chemical company executed a financial hedge to 

lock in natural gas prices, resulting in a significant 
reduction in risk from rising prices. 

This lever comes with risk and requires careful 
consideration. The danger is that organizations can 
lock themselves into higher prices or significant 
margin calls. External early-warning signals (such 
as a steel price threshold) should be in place and 
periodically refreshed.

Pass-through pricing: A response to pure inflation
Dynamic pricing levers are an alternative to cost 
reduction levers. Companies can respond to increases 
in input costs and price volatility by adopting a dynamic 
pricing strategy. They can often derive more value from 
pricing by setting the right price, optimizing discounts 
and rebates, and managing margin leakage. This 
option requires strong analytical capabilities, including 
sophisticated market segmentation and assessment 
of pricing impact. 

Analytics, implementation, and continuous testing: An example sequence

The implementation of strategies to 
improve a company’s posture can follow an 
analytics-based sequence of steps. Here is 
an example sequence:

1.  Analytically or qualitatively decompose 
inflation and evaluate the composition 
and extent of the company’s exposure—
its inflation fingerprint—according to the 
relevant inflation factors.

2.  Compose the inflation mitigation 
strategy: using a cross-functional 
approach, select the levers to be applied 
according to the company’s position.

3.  Test potential levers analytically against 

5.  Estimate the benefits and costs of 

actions under different scenarios. (Some 
steps will not be effective in reality—a 
contract change will not alter the effects 
of a country-wide ban on exports of an 
affected product, for example).  

scenarios, incorporating variable 
demand, labor costs, commodity prices, 
energy prices, interest rates, and supply 
delays. For a risk–reward analysis, 
evaluate levers with financial and 
nonfinancial metrics (such as EBITDA 
and volatility fluctuations, respectively); 
then prioritize strategies and optimize 
decision making under uncertainty. 

4.  When testing strategies against 

critical scenarios (such as supply chain 
concentrations or exposure to a foreign-
exchange pair), connect actions to early-
warning signals (such as a threshold for 
price increases). 

Using analytics to address inflation risks and strengthen competitive positioning

29

The dynamic pricing response to input cost 
increases and volatility is a strategy that is 
relevant for pure inflation. However, a partial price 
pass-through may be a component of an optimal 
response to all types of inflation. A manufacturing 
company, for example, managed granular price 
increases across thousands of products through 
customer pattern analysis and ended up with hardly 
a complaint; by contrast, a packaging company that 
had not prepared its sales force for price changes 
experienced double-digit market share losses. 

Accelerating your company’s  
analytics journey
Companies will begin with different levels of 
analytics sophistication. Some have had experience 
in implementing analytics solutions while others 
have not (see sidebar, “Analytics, implementation, 

and continuous testing: An example sequence”). 
For the application of inflation analytics, a few 
guideposts will help companies get up to speed:  

1.  Start small. Start with a single product, business 
unit, or geography. Most of these analyses are 
accretive and need not be completed together. 

2.  Start simple. Break down the income statement 
to drivers of margin. “Stress” these drivers with 
your view of inflation impact. Not all drivers will 
be affected by inflation, so they will not need 
complex analytics solutions.   

3.  Start now. Experience shows that capabilities, 
data, and know-how are always works in 
progress. The benefits of starting now always 
outweigh impact with better resources.

Supply chains:  
To build resilience, 
manage proactively

Supply chain upheavals show little sign of abating. Companies can 
address them by reconsidering outdated, short-term strategies and 
beginning the hard work of building structural resilience.

This article is a collaborative effort by Knut Alicke, Cengiz Bayazit, Tim Beckhoff, Tacy Foster, and 
Mihir Mysore, representing views from McKinsey’s Operations and Risk Management practices.

No one would dispute that the COVID-19 pandemic 
created significant disruption to global supply chains. 
Nothing like this had happened in decades, and 
many operators relied on strategies that only partly 
addressed their challenges. Then came the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine, which has caused the greatest 
humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second 
World War. Already, thousands of lives have been lost, 
and millions have been displaced—a tragedy with 
consequences that will unfold for years to come.

The invasion compounded supply chain troubles in 
critical sectors, including agriculture, automotive, 
energy, and food. As the frequency and magnitude of 
the disruptions increased, applying ad hoc remedies 
to restore predictability to a system premised on 
ever-increasing cost optimization became more 
difficult. To restore the needed resilience, supply 
chain operators may need to consider a range of 
options including structural reform.

So with good reason, the rapid decay of a decades-
old model of supply chain reliability and efficiency is 
a key feature of CEO agendas. Over the course of a 
decade, companies may face disruptions that erase 
half a year’s profits or more. For companies in most 
sectors, a single prolonged shock to production 
could wipe out 30 to 50 percent of one year’s 
earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation. 
Clogged ports, expensive cargo capacity, and 
emergency shipments became prevalent during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the conflict 
in Ukraine has also contributed to product-line 
closures, transport delays, and spiraling input costs. 
These issues have contributed to large increases 
in commodity prices and a troublesome spike 
in inflation and in expectations for higher prices 
around the globe. 

Yet these immediate effects are only part of the 
story. In fact, they may be overtaken in the long term 
by slower-moving but more permanent effects on 
supply chains occurring beneath the surface. Supply 
chain leaders could face challenges with short-
term shocks while installing the building blocks of 
deeper structural reform. Nonetheless, structural 
reform may be the only way for leaders to restore 

the resilience that companies depend on from their 
supply chains, as is evident from several of the short- 
and longer-term implications of the disruptions.

Key export categories are suffering 
immediate supply shocks 
Today, five categories of exports—agricultural 
products, chemicals, manufacturing, metals, and oil 
and gas—face three immediate challenges from the 
invasion of Ukraine:

 — reduced production or shutdowns at many 

manufacturing plants  

 — lower purchases of goods sourced from Russia, 
because of economic sanctions or self-imposed 
sanctioning by companies 

 — logistics disruptions across air cargo, ports, road 

and rail, and shipping 

These challenges have had an impact on product 
lines: for example, multiple automotive companies 
reduced production in Germany because wire-
harness suppliers shut down. Transport delays and 
spiraling input costs have become more frequent. 
These immediate effects have spread across export 
sectors, but the impact appears to be highest for the 
automotive, chemicals, energy, food and agriculture, 
and travel and logistics sectors (exhibit). Some 
particular effects deserve to be highlighted. 

First, since the conflict began, many companies 
have announced that they are exiting operations 
in Russia or refusing to carry Russian goods. This 
level of self-imposed sanctioning is creating several 
effects, including greater unpredictability, since 
disruptions are harder to track and estimate. 

Second, while many business leaders worry about 
rising inflation, they are also concerned about 
the unavailability of critical supply chain inputs 
because such shortfalls can shut down products 
and revenues. These effects will likely have a larger 
impact on companies than inflation but are harder to 
gauge in many supply chains and can occur quickly.

Finally, many such effects are still rippling through 
supply chains, and their full impact may not become 
obvious for a few months. Some companies, for 
instance, have safety stocks for exported materials. 
As those stocks get depleted, disruptions may 
become more frequent. 

These immediate effects are challenging. But 
leaders may also need to focus on the significant 
and long-lasting problems developing below the 
surface for supply chain operators.

The longer-term threat to demand and 
critical-materials volume
As we have seen during the war in Ukraine, 
supply chain operators face several emerging 
developments that could pose a larger, more long-
lasting challenge in the medium term. For example, 
an increased focus, particularly in Europe, on 
securing food, energy, and other critical materials 
will probably have a lasting effect on demand supply 

chains. Stockpiling items may provide a temporary 
buffer, but eventually, a guaranteed source of 
supply—driving up costs—may be needed. 

What’s more, lockdowns during the COVID-19 
pandemic, which contributed to shifts in consumer 
spending from services to products, are partly 
responsible for the current supply chain challenge. As 
demand begins shifting back to services, demand for 
products may decline. That could ease some of the 
pressure—but also adds to the overall uncertainty.

Lastly, demand for suppliers with lower carbon 
footprints or greener alternatives to existing 
products could rise as a result of the March 2022 
US Securities and Exchange Commission ruling on 
carbon disclosures1 (among other announcements), 
as well as Europe’s continued focus on sustainability. 
Suppliers may have to shift their inventory 
management strategies in the coming years.

Taken together, such factors will be a durable 
underlying source of supply chain disruptions, 

1 On March 21, 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rule changes that would require registrants to include certain 
climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports. This information would include greenhouse-gas emissions, a 
commonly used metric to assess a registrant’s exposure to climate risks.

Supply chains: To build resilience, manage proactively

33

 
which will evolve over time. As the impact of the 
conflict in Ukraine continues to develop, these 
problems may even get worse. Therefore, one 
consideration for business leaders is how to 
stabilize the immediate disruptions while building 
resilience against future ones.

Three steps to optimal resilience
Short-term solutions could work at a time when 
supply chains were more predictable than they are 
today. Preparing for long-term uncertainty and 
possible upheaval may encourage companies to 
build resilience into their supply chains. This process 
could evolve in three stages:

Firefighting
One potential response to supply chain problems 
is to focus on short-term, day-to-day actions, 
such as expedited delivery services to meet 
demand or speeding up production by purchasing 
components on an emergency basis. These 
tactics can help to some degree, particularly for 
identifying previously overlooked supply chain 
gaps. However, they don’t build resilience and 
aren’t fundamentally new, so overstretched 
suppliers may be reluctant to use them. 

In such cases, CEOs could consider implementing 
cross-silo efforts that ensure an agile response to 
fast-moving events. They could also exhort teams 
and suppliers to not only adopt appropriate short-
term measures but also stay the course for the more 
difficult long-term reforms, which begin during the 
second stage.

Integrating and streamlining operations
In this stage, three actions can be critical to building 
resilient supply chains: creating a nerve center for the 
supply chain, simulating and planning for extreme 
disruptions, and reevaluating just-in-time strategies.

Create a nerve center to consolidate organizational 
responses. A cross-functional team for such a 
nerve center coordinates and manages proactive 
responses to issues that might range from caring for 
distressed colleagues to testing financial stability 
under a range of scenarios. The nerve center could be 
organized under four categories: people, operating 
cadence, decision-enabling tools, and an early-
warning system, which could, for example, signal 
potential political developments or cyberthreats, as 
well as compliance or regulatory issues (see sidebar 
“Designing an integrated nerve center”). 

Designing an integrated nerve center

People
 — Nerve center organization: Outline  
the response, with clear owners  
and accountabilities.

 — Decision authority: Clarify any  

changes in decision authority needed 
to guide response.

Operating cadence
 — Weekly meeting calendar: Set up 

key meetings to ensure an integrated 
response and connections across 
multiple efforts.

memo that details the current situation, 

how it may evolve, and the immediate 
decisions needed.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022Creating long-term resilience in a high-tech supply chain: A case study

After experiencing significant supply 
chain disruptions from COVID-19, a 
global telecom company focused on 
going beyond building up inventory. In 
its efforts to develop end-to-end supply 
chain resilience, two areas took priority: 
changing supplier contracts to ensure 
maximum agility and transparency, and 
reducing the share of components sourced 
from any single supplier. The company 
already had dual suppliers for components 

but decided to go a step further by adding 
a production model using two different 
designs for the same products. This dual-
source, dual-design strategy would provide 
the highest level of protection against raw-
material shortages.

The next step was to evaluate the R&D 
outlay for the designs and to balance it 
with lower inventory-holding costs. The 

company conducted a pilot to test this 
approach and assess its feasibility for 
other products. It also drew up a sales 
model based on its exposure to the risks 
of the dual-design, dual-sourcing effort. 
In this way, the company developed the 
flexibility to expand its supplier base 
if necessary and to increase its sales 
volumes and gross margins.

Simulate and plan for extreme supply-and-demand 
disruptions. This second category of actions 
involves ordering components earlier than usual and 
allowing extra time for delivery; accounting for the 
higher cost of energy, materials, and transportation; 
and checking inventories of critical materials to 
reprioritize production should shortages seem 
inevitable. If logistics disruptions are likely, try to 
get capacity on alternative routes. Another tactic 
to avoid building up excess inventory is simulating 
the effects of regional demand shifts on production. 
Examine the risks in supplier networks, labor, 
manufacturing, and delivery to determine if any part 
of the value chain is exposed to internal or external 
disruptions. Set up controls to minimize their effects.

Reevaluate just-in-time inventory strategies. If 
a crisis on the scale of the pandemic occurs, the 
absence of a back stock of inventory or materials can 
seriously threaten supply chains. Many of today’s 
most pressing supply shortages (semiconductors, 
for example) occur in supplier subtiers where 
manufacturers have little visibility. To achieve 
transparency beyond the first tier, companies could 
work to identify suppliers from spending data, N-tier 
mapping, or both. Prioritize them by their importance 
to the business and assess their vulnerability. Some 
potential measures to mitigate risk include finding 
new suppliers, redesigning networks, resetting 
inventory targets, keeping safety stocks, and 
sourcing locally or regionally.

Achieving structural resilience
CEOs and other top executives may focus on quick 
responses during a crisis but may also need to 
consider the difficult concern of building longer-
term resilience. Transparency may be hard to attain. 
Diversifying the supplier base, though critical for 
resilience, is expensive. And the cost of keeping 
safety stocks on hand may be hard to justify if they 
are not used in several years. These issues are 
real and can make the task of building resilience in 
supply chains feel like wading through molasses, but 
leaders may have to continue to focus on them. (See 
sidebar “Creating long-term resilience in a high-tech 
supply chain: A case study,” to learn how one global 
telecom maker structured a strategy to protect itself 
from shortages of raw materials.)

Some ideas and proven techniques can help with 
the difficult work of building long-term supply chain 
resilience, such as the following:

Construct a ‘digital twin’ of the most critical parts 
of a supply chain. A digital twin is a virtual replica 
of a business’s operation that allows companies 
to simulate how a product, process, or service will 
perform before it is implemented in the real world. 
If building a digital twin isn’t feasible, two models 
could be constructed: one to estimate the current 
flow of Ukrainian or Russian commodities and 
materials that may be going into an organization’s 
products, and the other to show where a product

One option to help mitigate longer- 
term, more permanent damage from 
supply chain disruptions is to maintain 
a strategic focus on customers.

originates in the value chain. This approach can 
help organizations pinpoint hidden suppliers or 
materials flows and expose previously invisible 
interdependencies.

Create and test ‘what if’ scenarios. Suppose you 
want to find out what would happen if the shift from 
rail to sea transport reduced the supply of vessels 
by 25 percent. One technique you may want to 
consider is building several what-if scenarios that 
can be tested quickly and then prioritizing and 
mitigating the parts of the supply chain that fail 
most often. It may seem daunting to create a large 
number of scenarios nearly continuously, at varying 
levels of detail and impact, but that is critical for this 
technique to provide insights. The vulnerabilities 
it reveals may make a big difference, but leaders 
shouldn’t expect any one scenario to play out.

Increase data sharing with suppliers. To minimize 
risk when sharing data, businesses could consider 
terms that require the disclosure of data under 
specific conditions. Even if data sharing is restricted, 
companies may be able to have clean teams share data 
with a third-party firm that analyzes the supply chain 
for weaknesses and provides recommendations.

Tackling the medium-term challenge
One option to help mitigate longer-term, more 
permanent damage from supply chain disruptions 
is to maintain a strategic focus on customers. There 
are several reasons for this. 

First, e-commerce, by itself, doesn’t necessarily 
promote positive outcomes. Our research shows 
that many retailers whose online sales increased 
during the COVID-19 pandemic also experienced 
pressure on supply chains and high fulfillment costs 
that eroded profitability. One avenue for success 
in e-commerce is capturing high-value demand at 
an acceptable margin, depending on product and 
business model.

Second, the global economy may slow down in the 
coming year. The United States, for example, is 
posting strong growth and job creation numbers, 
but indicators of slackening demand have appeared. 
Prices in several sectors are spiraling quickly. The 
US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to curb 
rising inflation.2 In the eurozone, many observers 
suggest that a recession may be possible,3 linked to 
several factors including the ongoing impact of the 
conflict in Ukraine.

Consider ringfencing a small part of the supply 
chain team. Charge this subgroup solely with 
building long-term resilience, not resolving day-to-
day supply chain issues. 

Third, past economic downturns suggest that 
customers tend to stick with companies that stay 
closest to their core offerings. During the recession 
of 2008–09, for example, one company closed a

36

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022number of stores but increased its investment in 
those that stayed open, catering especially to its 
core segment. By contrast, its competitor sought 
to use the recession to enter a segment that was 
not part of its historical core. The company that 
stayed with its core customers emerged from the 
downturn far stronger than its competitor and grew 
significantly in the postrecession years. 

CEOs recognize that none of these actions come 
without costs and that it may be hard to count 

on visions of long-term resilience to pay for the 
investments required to achieve it. After the 
experience of the past two-plus years, chief 
executives may need to define the circumstances in 
which they think consumers would pay a premium 
to ensure the availability of goods. They could also 
consider exploring whether suppliers will accept 
discounts to help ensure demand for their products 
and absorb the costs through more productive 
operations. Perhaps the hardest task for CEOs 
could be convincing investors to accept resilience 
as the new table stakes and to change their view of 
expected risk-adjusted returns.

How to build geopolitical 
resilience amid a 
fragmenting global order

Organizations need to strategically invest in capabilities, people, 
processes, structures, and technology to navigate the risks arising from 
an evolving and fraught geopolitical landscape.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022Geopolitical risk is at the top of the CEO agenda, 
according to McKinsey’s latest survey of global 
economic conditions. In the face of fragmentation 
and uncertainty, many business leaders are 
responding by intensifying their focus on resilience.

For the past three decades, going global meant 
unlocking specialization and scale, developing 
markets, and creating multinational corporations. 
In 2021 alone, low interest rates and ample cash 
led US firms to spend $506 billion on foreign 
mergers and acquisitions. 

But the orthodoxy of globalization is under strain. 
The latest salvo: multiple disruptions triggered 
by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The world seems 
to be tethered to crisis, or the threat of it. CEOs 
need to know whether they can still remain global 
players and, if so, how.

Looking ahead, the challenges are likely to only 
become more acute. According to the US National 
Intelligence Council’s Global trends 2040 report, 
in the next two decades, competition for global 
influence is likely to reach its highest level since 
the Cold War: “No single state is likely to dominate 
all regions or domains, and a broader range of 

actors will compete to advance their ideologies, 
goals, and interests.”

Amid these challenges, the value of resilience 
is on the rise. That is why McKinsey and the 
World Economic Forum launched the Resilience 
Consortium earlier this year. The consortium aims 
to convene government ministers, chief executives, 
and heads of international organizations to develop 
a common resilience framework for public- and 
private-sector organizations. Leveraging the 
principles set out in the framework, the consortium 
can hope to achieve more sustainable, inclusive 
growth amid external shocks. 

To be sure, many global executives have an intuitive 
sense of where to focus initially to build resilience. 
However, most are seeking a more rigorous and 
analytical approach to fostering geopolitical 
resilience and to creating an enterprise-wide 
“resilience premium.” 

To address the geopolitical risks of the present—
and future—leaders should challenge their 
organizations on six key dimensions of resilience: 
business model, reputation, organization, 
operations, technology, and finance (exhibit).

The orthodoxy of globalization is under 
strain. The world seems to be tethered

1. Business model resilience
“Organizations that take a serious, systematic, 
and senior-driven approach to political risk 
management are likely to be surprised less often 
and recover better.”

– Condoleezza Rice and Amy Zegart, Political Risk: 
How Businesses and Organizations Can Anticipate 
Global Insecurity (Hachette, 2018)

Building business model resilience starts with 
the board. To exercise effective oversight and 
decision making, boards need to first develop an 
understanding of geopolitical developments that 
are material to the organization. 

While most board members will have a “high 
altitude” perspective on specific risks, 
individual members may vary in their insight 
and interpretation, and the aggregate view may 
fluctuate as board membership evolves. To 

establish a benchmark for resilience, organizations 
should take a systematic approach to radiating 
insights on geopolitical developments and trends 
to the board and leadership team. This may take 
the form of analytical products, briefings, or 
scenario exercises—anchored not on the “what” 
but on the “so what” and “now what.” 

Second, the sheer pace and volatility of geopolitical 
developments means that boards should not waiver 
in paying attention. They should dedicate time at 
each meeting to discussing relevant topics, and 
convene as necessary in the interim. 

One way to focus and structure the board 
discussion is to identify priority geopolitical risks. 
Boards could leverage a tiered approach, with 
tier five denoting markets with the highest level 
of geopolitical risk and tier one denoting markets 
with localized risks that can be managed by local 
leadership and teams. 

40

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022For many boards, the higher-tier markets are 
often identifiable. Questions we hear from 
CEOs on business model resilience in high-tier 
markets include: 

How should I think about my corporate footprint and 
intellectual property amid geopolitical tensions? 

Should I view my operation as a separate region 
that is carved off to insulate it from geopolitical 
tensions, or does the lack of direct control itself 
generate risk? 

How should I view my relationship with my joint 
venture partner in the near, medium, and long 
term? 

How do I manage extraterritorial and/or 
contradicting legal, tax, or regulatory requirements?

Is there a point where I will be forced to exit, and 
how I do work backward from that point?

In addition to grappling with these strategic 
questions in a top-tier market, boards also need 
to manage the longtail risk of operating across 
multiple tier-one markets. 

To do so requires organizations to establish a 
mechanism to conduct regular global market 
scans and to assess in a scorecard fashion across 
internal teams—legal, security, finance, risk, and 
communications—the aggregate risk (versus 
opportunities) of operating in a particular market. 
These teams can provide recommendations to the 
board on options to recalibrate market presence 
or evolve the legal and financial structure of the 
organization. Their efforts can be coordinated by a 
dedicated geopolitical risk unit that may sit within 
an organization’s finance, government relations, 
legal, risk, strategy, or other teams depending on 
the organization’s structure. 

Understanding and exercising oversight over 
geopolitical risk is necessary but not sufficient. 
The board should drive and direct the development 
of proactive risk-mitigation measures and crisis 
response with standing updates from teams on 
execution and material new issues. 

2. Reputational resilience
“While there is a rising call for business to be more 
engaged in geopolitics, the call also extends to 
CEOs, who are expected to not only be the face 
of the new geopolitical corporation but they are 
also expected to shape policy on societal and 
geopolitical issues.”

– 2022 Edelman Trust Barometer special report: 
The geopolitical business

A first step to building reputational resilience is 
to strive for internal alignment around operations 
connected with geopolitically sensitive markets. In 
short, organizations need to know what they stand 
for (and what they are against). 

Not every geopolitical crisis will comprise as sharp 
an inflection point as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in 
response to which many organizations have chosen 
to curtail or halt their Russia operations. In many 
cases, decisions will be less cut and dried. Therefore, 
organizations need to step back and parse out 
their stance on individual situations. One way to do 
that is to create market-specific assessments, or 
“compacts,” that fuse corporate strategy and risk 
management. These compacts should be clear in 
the organization’s priorities in high-risk markets 
and the criteria on which organizations assess 
and manage risks. They should also set out how 
to deploy the criteria in a way that is aligned with 
operational and performance goals. The risks could 
come in many guises, including financial, health and 
safety, legal, political, or reputational—for example,  
working with the public sector in countries governed 
by authoritarian regimes.

A clear stance is a prerequisite for the next step 
in building reputational resilience: developing a 
coherent values-driven narrative. Indeed, many 
organizations today are grappling with how 
to explain not just their stance but their core 
identity, notably around their presence in markets 
governed by authoritarian regimes. There is a 
recognition that the old arguments pegged to 
globalization and wandel durch handel (change 
through trade) have dimmed. 

How to build geopolitical resilience amid a fragmenting global order

41

In the age of instant information,  
the story told in one market won’t 
stay there. And a narrative that works 
in one place could inhibit market 
opportunities in another.

Based on our benchmarking of US-based 
multinational companies, we see three potential 
postures: proactive—for example, engagement is 
important for US competitiveness and leadership; 
reactive—for example, principled engagement with 
close attention to supply chain integrity; or silent—
meaning generally avoiding public statements. 

Whichever narrative an organization chooses, it 
needs to bear in mind that, in the age of instant 
information, the story told in one market won’t stay 
there. And a narrative that works in one place could 
inhibit market opportunities in another, or create 
sensitivities internally and among regions. In short, 
there is no silver bullet. 

With a clear stance on the core of the narrative, the 
third step in bolstering reputational resilience is a 
robust government and public-affairs capability 
to communicate the narrative to key stakeholders. 
While the ultimate responsibility of articulating 
stance and narrative falls on the CEO, government 
and public-affairs professionals situated across 
key markets are critical to managing stakeholder 
relations, cultivating “air cover” in sensitive 
markets, and providing an escalation mechanism 
for CEO and leadership-level engagement.

3. Organizational resilience 
“Geopolitical tensions are rising, leaving business 
in the line of fire. Suddenly companies’, and 
executives’, nationalities matter again.  . . . Can 

we have peace in the company when the world is 
in turmoil?”

— Financial Times (May 16, 2021)

External geopolitical pressures are increasingly 
triggering internal pressures. The days of the 
borderless executive are receding. Indeed, 
nationality and cultural relativism are coming to 
the fore in discussions around stance, narrative, 
strategy, and risk appetite. These discussions can 
take place on multiple levels: between leadership 
and teams, regional and local offices, or global 
headquarters. 

Points of internal debate cited by executives include: 

•  Are we a global organization headquartered 
in the United States, or are we an American 
company that is global in its outlook?  

•  To what extent should assessing the 

reputational risk around a particular project 
be indexed to a potential response from 
Western governments and media outlets in a 
multipolar era? 

•  How do we keep a “neutral stance” amid 

geopolitical tensions? Can a company have 
no “citizenship”? 

•  What kind of diversity of geographical 

cultural norms and standards is feasible 

42

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022 
and desirable in a global company when 
stakeholders (including media and even 
governments) in many countries increasingly 
challenge the norms and standards applied in 
other geographies? 

•  How should we reconcile perceived “double 
standards” around how leadership responds 
to different social and humanitarian 
crises across markets, from messaging to 
charitable giving?  

In this context, developing organizational resilience 
is no longer just about maintaining cultural cohesion. 
It is also about sustaining a global ethos amid 
powerful centrifugal forces. 

Three approaches can be taken to build organization 
resilience. First, organizations need to ensure 
they have inclusive governance structures, from 
the board to risk committees. These must reflect 
diverse geographic viewpoints and nationalities. 
If colleagues do not feel they are part of the 
discussion on shaping direction, or view discussions 
as indexed to a particular lens, the struggle for 
retaining global hearts and minds will be lost.  

Second, leaders, starting with the CEO, need to 
have open and honest dialogues in appropriate fora. 
These should acknowledge global stresses and the 
ways they are felt internally, empower colleagues 
to air their views on stance and risk appetite, and 
create a common sense of purpose. For example, 
a critical message from corporate leaders amid 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is to differentiate 
condemnation of the Russian government’s actions 
from support for Russian colleagues. 

Finally, organizations need to consider a range of 
targeted initiatives to promote connectivity and 
cohesion, from rotating colleagues in and out of 
geopolitically sensitive markets to sharing views 
(particularly as COVID-19-related travel restrictions 
ease), while also ensuring that screening and 
“insider threat” mechanisms are sufficiently robust.

geopolitical flash points are stress-testing the 
operational resilience of organizations across 
the globe. 

A priority area of focus has been and must remain 
protecting and pivoting supply chains. Supply chain 
operations should consider a range of resilience 
measures. In the near to medium term, these 
include creating a nerve center for the supply chain, 
simulating and planning for extreme disruptions, 
revaluating just-in-time strategies, and assessing 
the resilience of one’s suppliers’ suppliers as part 
of a full look-through approach. Efforts to diversify 
and build redundancy in supply chains must 
critically factor in the political risks of entering any 
new market through a detailed assessment across 
multiple risk indicators. 

To achieve long-term structural resilience, however, 
organizations should consider measures such as 
constructing a “digital twin” of the most critical 
parts of the supply chain, creating and testing 
what-if scenarios, and ring-fencing a small part 
of the supply team to focus on building long-term 
resilience instead of day-to-day supply chain issues. 

Supply chain security must be complemented by 
the physical security of one’s people. From Ukraine 
and Russia to Ethiopia to Myanmar, organizations 
in the past 18 months alone have had to secure and 
evacuate colleagues globally. Considerations range 
from maintaining redundancy in communication 
channels, aligning with security vendors on the 
ground, and keeping a low profile to mitigate any 
risk of retaliation should an organization decide to 
exit. As future flash points arise, investing in early-
warning systems and extraction plans is essential.

Organizations today are also confronting the 
strategic challenge of maintaining the global 
networks of yesteryear amid geopolitical 
fragmentation. Building technological resilience 
in this context requires accelerating planning and 
taking concrete steps in four key areas.

economy roiled by inflationary and other shocks, 
these challenges may continue to manifest. 
Thinking through crisis protocols in advance and 
building out an early warning system around 
macroeconomic challenges are key resilience 
measures to consider. 

Complying with data localization requirements is 
another area testing global IT architectures, as 
companies need to think through regulatory and 
other considerations. 

A third area is managing data access. 
Organizations need to ensure appropriate 
compartmentalization of data as well as manage 
external cyber intrusions. 

Paying close attention to ensuring resiliency 
against diverse crises is also essential. This 
includes the ability to effectively respond to 
cyberattacks, from recovering data to deploying 
new technological equipment across markets with 
speed as required. 

Global sanctions and regulatory risks, however, 
are rapidly evolving and testing organizations, 
since the escalating application of sanctions 
and counter-sanctions across multiple 
jurisdictions is today at the core of geopolitical 
risk. These measures can be existential in terms 
of a company’s ability to operate in a market. 
Compliance with one jurisdiction’s laws can risk 
running afoul of another’s. Resilience in the face 
of the growing global weaponization of trade and 
investment requires not just having a precise 
understanding of ever-shifting regulatory regimes 
and a robust compliance capability but also driving 
a culture of compliance with the organization itself 
on an issue with no room for error. 

6. Financial resilience 
At the intersection of geopolitical risk and financial 
resilience are a number of issues that organizations 
need to carefully manage on an ongoing basis. 
These range from long-standing foreign exchange 
(and expropriation) risks to evolving sanctions risks.  

Foreign exchange risks are, of course, well known 
to many organizations. From a rapid devaluation 
of currency in Sri Lanka amid the country’s 
worst economic crisis to controls on withdrawing 
funds in Myanmar following a military coup, 
companies have had to and must be prepared to 
deal with a range of constrictions, from paying 
their employees to moving funds. With the global 

“We are more conscious of the risks but don’t have 
a lot of good ideas.” 

For many organizations, this observation by the 
global head of government affairs of a Fortune 
500 company rings true. Yet every organization 
faces a unique set of circumstances. With that in 
mind, the above framework is offered as a starting 
point for internal discussions on how to develop 
appropriate solutions. The new normal requires a 
new CEO mindset. That means making geopolitical 
resilience a strategic priority that will both protect 
the organization and lay the foundations for long-
term competitive advantage.

Many financial institutions have recently 
undergone major risk transformations that drove 
universal risk capability uplift and cultural shift. 
Uplifting risk management capability for financial 
institutions can be particularly challenging if the 
required transformation requires coordination 
across business areas and functions. For two 
decades, there has been (and still is) an intense 
focus on nonfinancial risks (NFRs). While regional 

or global “super incidents” originally drove the 
emergence of NFRs as a theme, the evolution of 
NFR management is ongoing, with variations in form 
and severity from one region to another (Exhibit 1). 
NFR can arise from shifting customer or community 
expectations, change to or breaches of regulations 
(for example, financial crime, privacy), malicious 
external attacks (such as fraud, cyber), or external 
events (for example, the COVID-19 pandemic).

1 For example, in the United Kingdom, the exposure of misselling of payment protection insurance at a handful of institutions became an 
industry-wide inquiry resulting in about £40 billion in compensation being paid to customers to date. In North America in 2013, what were 
initially thought to be isolated cases of fraudulent account openings became a full-scale conduct investigation (involving the FBI and the 
Federal Reserve), finding evidence of misconduct in sales practices in mortgages, credit cards, and insurance. In Australia, the fines and 
customer remediations arising from the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services industry in 
2018 are now estimated at more than $10 billion AUD. 

46

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022The implications of a super incident can be 
significant and include direct financial losses, 
fines (Exhibit 2), compensation or remediation 
costs, and reputational damage. Secondary 
effects could include reduced sales or accelerated 
disintermediation by other market participants (such 
as fintechs) due to lost trust.1

This environment drove financial institutions to 
initiate major risk transformation programs to 
address incidents, immediate issues, and deeper 
root causes. These programs have significant 
monetary cost. However, the opportunity cost for 
the organization is much higher, given the amount 
of management attention and organizational 
capacity required for successful delivery and 
sustainable conclusion. 

The biggest challenge in starting a risk transformation 
is often not the “why” or the “what,” but the “how.” 
Questions include how to set it up and conclude it, and 
then transition back to enhanced business as usual. 
Large-scale risk transformations often fail because 
change is not effectively implemented across the 
organization: milestones are ticked off without actually 
improving risk management, addressing underlying 
culture, or reducing risk. 

In this article, we consider different forms of risk 
transformations and unpack the heart, art, and 
science of their successful delivery and conclusion.

An interview with Scott Wharton: Insights from the frontline of large-scale transformations

1. What are three key success factors for 
a large-scale transformation? 
There are a range of factors that influence 
the success of a transformation. These are 
three that I’ve found important.

accountabilities by shining a light on both 
progress and where help or escalation is 
needed. In my experience, this works best 
when you also foster a mindset of learning 
from failures and escalating concerns early.

First, motivation matters. Motivation 
is the bedrock for the success of any 
transformation. In the initial stages, you 
need a clear definition of what success 
looks like and why change is necessary. 
Ask what will be better post-transformation, 
and rally around that vision. We had an 
imperative to change that helped to rally 
the organization, and while that was helpful 
at first, imperatives for change dissipate 
over time. We maintained our motivation 
through deliberate interventions, including 
a strong tone from the top that continually 
reinforced the importance of what we 
were doing and why. Transformation is a 
marathon, not a sprint.

Second, have a detailed and dynamic 
plan. It is critical to have a detailed plan 
that sets out what needs to be done and by 
when. Then, that plan needs to be adjusted 
as you and your team move through it, 
embracing learnings and adapting. A plan 
review cycle can help achieve this. In our 
case, this cycle occurred quarterly, and 
considered learnings and reflections from 
a broad set of stakeholders involved in the 
transformation. We created an ongoing 
rhythm of reflect, learn, iterate. 

2. What are typical challenges of a large-
scale transformation?
There will be a range of challenges to 
overcome, and these will differ depending 
on the context the organization is 
confronting. Two common challenges 
are getting the change to permeate 
throughout the organization and ensuring 
changes are sustainable.

One key blocker to getting changes to 
permeate is change fatigue, especially 
in the middle of the organization where 
change is crucial. Strong change 
management and communications to 
support leaders at all levels is important, 
as is helping leaders build their own skills 
to drive the change. Playing back the 
incremental wins as they happen along 
the way can also help to inject energy and 
maintain a sense of progress.

Ultimately a transformation program 
isn’t successful unless the changes are 
sustainable after the program finishes. 
Establishing an enduring capability beyond 
the formal program that can monitor, 
continuously improve, and sustain the 
outcomes delivered is often overlooked but 
is critically important. 

Third, ensure accountabilities are clear. A 
plan is no use unless it drives outcomes. To 
enable this, mechanisms need to be put 
in place so that people understand what 
they need to get done and by when. Careful 
architecting of accountabilities, coupled 
with pragmatic governance, will sharpen 

3. What role did senior leaders play in  
the RAP at CommBank?
At CommBank, our senior leaders 
were deeply involved from the get-go. 
This helped ensure alignment on, and 
understanding of, the work ahead. 

Scott Wharton, Group Executive, 
Program Delivery, Commonwealth Bank 
of Australia

Scott Wharton’s career spans over 
20 years in financial services and other 
industries across Australia, Asia, and 
the United States. He has led numerous 
large-scale transformations, including 
the delivery of Commonwealth Bank 
of Australia’s (CommBank) Remedial 
Action Plan (RAP), in response to 
the Australian Prudential Regulation 
Authority’s (APRA) Prudential Inquiry into 
governance, culture, and accountability 
in 2018. CommBank is Australia’s leading 
provider of integrated financial services. 
The Independent Reviewer assuring 
CommBank’s progress over the last three 
years expressed in their final report1 
that delivery of the RAP was “one of the 
most comprehensive, if not the most 
comprehensive, reforms of corporate 
culture in recent Australian memory.”

48

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022An interview with Scott Wharton: Insights from the frontline of large-scale transformations  
(continued)

This level of engagement continued 
throughout the course of the RAP, 
including participation in key elements of 
implementation, ongoing learning, and 
adjustment of the approach. 

As the Independent Reviewer pointed 
out in their final report on CommBank’s 
transformation, the critical foundation 
for the program was “strong” and “unified 
leadership from the board and executive 
leadership team,” which delivered a 
“consistent and persistent tone from  
the top.” 

4. How did you ensure the change  
landed successfully? 
There is a natural tension between 
the transformation program and the 

business’s usual priorities. It is important 
to be mindful of this tension, and do all 
that is feasible to ensure the business can 
successfully absorb the change coming 
from the transformation program with 
minimal disruption. 

One step we took was the creation of a 
rolling 12-month view of the changes 
on the horizon. Every quarter we would 
then spend time with our businesses 
to gain their feedback on the forward 
view of change, including working with 
them to assess their ability to effectively 
implement what was expected. This 
enabled us to proactively adjust and 
re-sequence the overall transformation 
plans, and identify where additional 
support was needed. 

We also took steps to regularly garner 
views on the transformation from people 
at all levels of the organization. This 
was helpful in shaping effective change 
management plans, as well as maintaining 
a broad base of support for the changes 
being implemented. 

5. Any final comments?
Albeit much has been done at CommBank 
to transform the organization, there is 
still much more to do. The journey of 
continuous improvement never ends.

The shapes and forms of risk 
transformations
There are four broad categories of risk 
transformations:

 — Business area or end-to-end process capability 
uplift and remediation (for example, global 
markets, business banking, mortgages). These 
transformations are typically business-led, 
driven by embedded line-one risk and control 
teams. Such transformations often include 
process, system, and control mapping; process 
simplification, digitization, and automation; 
documenting, decommissioning, and building 
ideally automated, preventative controls and 
monitoring in critical process break points; and 
clarifying responsibilities. 

 — Risk-type-specific capability uplift and/or 

remediation (for example, financial crime, cyber, 
privacy, conduct). These transformations are 

typically driven by the respective risk experts 
(such as a money laundering reporting officer 
for financial crime and chief information security 
officer for cyber crime) and supported by the 
risk function. Such transformations often 
include risk-type framework and operating-
model uplift, paired with targeted remediation 
of severe issues for a specific risk type. They 
are often triggered by severe incidents, issues, 
and regulatory scrutiny. Typically, significant 
resource buildup occurs to work through issues 
and incidents, as could be observed in financial 
crime programs at global banks using hundreds 
and even thousands of case analysts. 

 — Risk function operating-model uplift (for 

example, changes to structure, internal risk 
functions, and company-wide processes). 
These transformations are typically driven by the 
risk function. Such transformations often include 
defining the ambition and value proposition of 

Risk transformations: The heart, the art, and the science

49

the risk function; improving the structure of the 
function (including divisions, risk-type expertise 
regions, and shared services); simplifying and 
clarifying the interactions with the business and 
other functional areas; and identifying and hiring 
capabilities to deliver. 

 — Holistic enterprise-wide risk transformation 

(for example, uplift of underlying frameworks, 
governance, risk culture, remuneration, 
accountabilities). These transformations are 
typically board or CEO-sponsored programs 
involving all businesses and functions and 
considering all (nonfinancial) risks. Such 
transformations often include uplifting the risk 
management framework and policy governance; 
establishing, improving or operationalizing 
the risk taxonomy; improving the risk appetite 
statement, in particular, for NFR metrics 
cascaded into business and operationalization; 
uplifting and implementing a code of conduct 
and consistently operationalizing the three 
lines of defense model; uplifting risk culture 
measurement; uplifting remuneration for risk-
based adjustments, and so on. Holistic risk 
transformations generally do not focus on 
direct risk reduction but rather on changing the 
general way the business operates—they are 
broader business transformations. 

Risk transformations often take two to three 
years of dedicated effort, with enterprise-wide 
transformations typically taking three to five 
years. While transformation setups differ, most 
have a central program team of five to ten full-time 
equivalents (FTEs) for smaller transformations, with 
holistic risk transformations running central teams 
of 15 to 50 FTEs that focus on coordination, tracking, 
quality assurance, sharing of best practices, 
and support for the most challenging problems, 
including the coordinated delivery of change across 
business areas and functions. 

After supporting numerous businesses through 
transformations, we have found that while the 
science of transformations is crucial to get right, it 
is the heart and the art that deliver transformation 
programs to their successful conclusion and 
sustainably embed the change across the 
organization (Exhibit 3).  

Science speaks to the mechanics that need to be 
in place around program structure, integrated plan 
development, delivery mechanisms, and regulator 
engagement throughout the process. 

Art refers to capabilities, accountability, 
prioritization, and use of targeted interventions to 
keep the program on track.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022Heart includes genuine shared motivation or 
purpose, a transformation mindset, a willingness 
to challenge cultural norms, and a program of 
communication that connects with the professional 
identity of employees. With science and art, the 
key conditions are in place for a successful risk 
program. But heart is a prerequisite for deep 
cultural change, which is required for a sustainable 
enterprise-wide transformation.

Getting to the ‘heart’ 
While we live in a rationality-driven work 
environment, human actions and behaviors are 
driven by deeper mindsets and cultural traits. 
Driving a transformation that changes those 
mindsets and cultural traits is hard; it needs to go 
below the surface and work with what motivates the 
organization and its individuals.

 — Motivation. “Because the regulator wants 

it” is not an intrinsic motivation—one needs 
to dig deeper and consider the motivations of 
employees. Successful transformation in any 
circumstance will require as much of a change 
in mindset as in any system or process. An 
in-depth diagnostic of the psychology of the 
organization can help define a vision of change 
that connects to the collective motivation and 
purpose of the organization and ensures that 
the desired change will stick in the long term. 
“Serving our customers better” is an example of a 
collective motivation. 

 — Transformation mindset. The mindset of the 
transformation needs to balance delivery 
discipline and accountability; agility and 
pragmatism; continuous improvement; and a 
sense of chronic unease. This finely balanced 
mindset will enable organizations to do what 
they say while still being able to course-correct 
and improve when new information becomes 
available and to quickly spot and address 
emerging challenges. If a risk transformation  
is initiated in response to a major incident,  
an honest appraisal of what drove the failures 
and adequate humbleness when considering 
the magnitude of the required cultural change 
are key.  

 — Culture. Organizations have a variety of cultural 
traits that help them thrive in transformation 
but also some that hold them back. Traits 
that often lead to unsuccessful or stalled 
transformations include being too siloed or too 
collaborative. This can lead to change being 
implemented inconsistently or stopped by 
a few business areas, or over-collaboration 
that results in lack of productivity and missed 
deadlines. Continuous reflection is required 
to be aware of and address deeply rooted 
cultural challenges, including honest appraisal 
of successes and failures, celebration of 
positive cultural behaviors, and constructive 
challenging of cultural norms, all while 
maintaining psychological safety. 

 — Communication. Motivation must reach the 

hearts and minds of employees. Intensive  
and continuous dialogue with a broad set  
of stakeholders allows a transformation 
program to keep its finger on the pulse while 
also enabling staff to own challenges and  
drive solutions. Communication needs to 
build on the organization and its leadership’s 
personal motivation—this is what makes it 
genuine and effective. 

Appreciating the ‘art’
More basic than the heart but still more 
fundamental than the science of transformation 
is the art. The art supports smooth and effective 
delivery of a program that leads to sustainable 
change–versus merely delivering a set of activities 
and milestones.  

 — Capability. The skills required to transform 
are often not those required to manage. A 
risk transformation program team must have 
capabilities across project execution, strategy, 
and risk management. The team should adopt 
both an inward- and outward-looking mindset 
that leverages the experiences of others (for 
example, learning visits at global peers and 
regular exchange with local peers). Key roles in 
the business and the risk function may require 
new talent to bring fresh impetus to transform 
or deviate from ingrained practices (that is, 

Risk transformations: The heart, the art, and the science

51

 
 
breaking the mold). Targeted external support 
for expertise and ongoing challenges and 
advice is reasonable. 

 — Accountability. Large-scale risk 

transformations require collective 
accountability: the whole executive team  
must stack hands to deliver the target outcome. 
The complexity and duration of these programs 
makes them hard to execute; they are often 
costly and feel more like a burden than an 
opportunity. Balancing the accountabilities  
of individuals versus the whole organization, 
and linking program outcomes to remuneration, 
are both critical. Strong top-down authority 
from the board and CEO is essential in 
supporting prioritization, providing advice, and 
clearing roadblocks.  

 — Prioritization. One of the biggest challenges is 

managing competing priorities and ensuring 
that the organization can absorb the amount 
of change required. This requires clear 
articulation of short- and long-term milestones 
to prioritize and sequence change at regular 
intervals. A radical simplification lens, which 
addresses gold plating by particular framework 
teams and over-implementation by the 
businesses, can reduce the need to deprioritize 
and descope. 

 — Intervention mechanisms. Means to anticipate 
hurdles and support course correction must 
be created: formal mechanisms to identify 
expected challenges in the form of regular 
premortem exercises and formal program 
reviews are essential. The central decision-
making body needs the authority to rapidly 
course correct through reprioritizing or 
redeploying resources. This is also critical to 
address change fatigue, which will naturally 
occur over the course of a three-year program.

Excelling at the ‘science’
Last but not least, the science is not merely 
technical. There are ways to optimize the science of 
transformation, to excel at it.  

 — Program structure. Banks often consider risk 
transformation as the accountability of the 
risk function. However, this setup may just 
scratch the surface and fail to address root 
causes and systemic issues. Effective large-
scale risk transformation requires particular 
accountability for the program to be assigned 
across functional leadership and business 
areas, where many of the inadequacies in 
systems, processes, and behaviors originate. 
Coordination between these stakeholders is 
essential and often driven by a neutral, central 
program team that sits outside of lines one 
and two. The rationale is that the engagement 
between these lines is often part of the 
problem, as in the three lines of defense model, 
and that the capability and mindset of both 
lines require improvement. The central team 
intervenes and escalates when the program is 
off track, with support from a communications 
team and change infrastructure. While the 
central team is accountable for coordination, 
it is important that the accountability for 
framework design and implementation delivery 
remains with the business-as-usual owners 
(line two/functional teams and line one/
business teams, respectively).  

 — Integrated plan. Integration of roles, 

responsibilities, and deliverables within the 
overall program is challenging. Creating 
an integrated view of change by using an 
integrated plan allows for prioritization, 
sequencing, and interdependency 
management. It also allows for a clear lineage 
between relevant problem statements, 
target states, activities, milestones, and 
outcomes. Structuring the plan into design, 
implementation, and embedment is helpful 
to coordinate delivery and distinguish the 
shift from the design of framework elements 
in functional areas to their implementation in 
business areas. The embedment stage includes 
ensuring new practices become part of the 
organization’s DNA and smoothly transitioning 
back to enhanced business as usual.  

 — Delivery mechanism. Implementation of 

complex change across the business (line one) 

52

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022 
in a work plan, ending a monitorship, or meeting 
regulatory commitments. These are important, but 
genuinely transformative success lies in the smooth 
shift from programmatic setup to sustainably 
uplifted business-as-usual operations with 
embedded mechanisms for further improvement.  

For this to happen, the uplifted capabilities need 
to be fully embedded into the regular business 
and risk cycles owned by their business-as-usual 
owners. They need to be regularly reviewed for 
fit-for-purpose and scope for further improvement. 
These regular cycles can include annual strategic 
planning, risk appetite refresh, policy reviews, 
assurance, audit schedules, quarterly change 
prioritization, and performance tracking as well as 
trigger-based uplifts driven by new business, new 
products, new regulations, and incidents. 

The relatively short time frame of a risk transformation 
allows for improvement of frameworks, processes, 
and governance, but it takes time and often a few 
improvement cycles for the organization to fully 
embrace and internalize them.  

Finally, the learnings of the transformation should 
be captured and shared because the external 
environment is constantly evolving, and often 
another risk transformation looms around the corner. 

is often where risk transformations fail. The 
best-designed set of change initiatives can 
fail without an effective delivery mechanism 
that supports implementation and sustainable 
embedment of change. Developing a mechanism 
to ensure appropriate engagement between 
lines two and one in the design of change 
initiatives—and a well-coordinated and 
considered delivery mechanism for supporting 
line one implementation—is critical. Ideally, this 
mechanism is aligned with natural business 
rhythms such as quarterly delivery and 
performance cycles. 

 — Regulatory engagement. Transparency 
and continuous dialogue with regulators 
are important. Proactive, professional, and 
respectful engagement can enable greater 
understanding and appreciation for regulators 
with respect to the challenges faced in large-
scale risk transformations and can encourage 
offers for guidance and positive reinforcement. 
Regulators might share their own expectations 
and observations from other institutions  
and provide insight into their own priorities.  
It is crucial to understand the regulator’s 
priorities and motivation—they are large 
institutions with public profiles, reputations, 
and individual ambitions. 

The end is often only the beginning
As the above three elements (heart, art, and science) 
demonstrate, successfully concluding a risk 
transformation seldom ends with just milestones

Does ESG really  
matter—and why?

Although valid questions have been raised about ESG, the need for 
companies to understand and address their externalities is likely to 
become essential to maintaining their social license.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022Since the acronym “ESG” (environmental, social, 
and governance) was coined in 2005, and until 
recently, its fortunes were steadily growing. To 
take one example, there has been a fivefold growth 
in internet searches for ESG since 2019, even as 
searches for “CSR” (corporate social responsibility)—
an earlier area of focus more reflective of corporate 
engagement than changes to a core business model—
have declined. Across industries, geographies, and 
company sizes, organizations have been allocating 
more resources toward improving ESG. More than  
90 percent of S&P 500 companies now publish  
ESG reports in some form, as do approximately  
70 percent of Russell 1000 companies.1 In a 
number of jurisdictions, reporting ESG elements 
is either mandatory or under active consideration. 
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) is considering new rules that 
would require more detailed disclosure of climate-
related risks and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions.2 
Additional SEC regulations on other facets of ESG 
have also been proposed or are pending.3

The rising profile of ESG has also been also plainly 
evident in investments, even while the rate of new 
investments has recently been falling. Inflows into 
sustainable funds, for example, rose from $5 billion 
in 2018 to more than $50 billion in 2020—and then 
to nearly $70 billion in 2021; these funds gained 
$87 billion of net new money in the first quarter of 
2022, followed by $33 billion in the second quarter.4 
Midway through 2022, global sustainable assets are 
about $2.5 trillion. This represents a 13.3 percent 
fall from the end of Q1 2022 but is less than the 
14.6 percent decline over the same period for the 
broader market.5

A major part of ESG growth has been driven by the 
environmental component of ESG and responses 
to climate change. But other components of ESG, 
in particular the social dimension, have also been 
gaining prominence. One analysis found that social-
related shareholder proposals rose 37 percent in the 
2021 proxy season compared with the previous year.6

In the wake of the war in Ukraine and the ensuing 
human tragedy, as well as the cumulative 
geopolitical, economic, and societal effects, 
critics have argued that the importance of ESG 
has peaked.7 Attention, they contend, will shift 
increasingly to the more foundational elements of a 
Maslow-type hierarchy of public- and private-sector 
needs,8 and in the future, today’s preoccupation 
with ESG may be remembered as merely a fad 
and go the way of similar acronyms that have been 
used in the past.9 Others have argued that ESG 
represents an odd and unstable combination of 
elements and that attention should be only focused 
on environmental sustainability.10 In parallel, 
challenges to the integrity of ESG investing have 
been multiplying. While some of these arguments 
have also been directed to policy makers, analysts, 
and investment funds, the analysis presented in this 
article (and in the accompanying McKinsey piece, 
“How to make ESG real,” August 2022) is focused at 
the level of the individual company. In other words: 
Does ESG really matter to companies? What is the 
business-grounded, strategic rationale?

mainstream and gained support and traction, it has

consistently encountered doubt and criticism as well. 
The main objections fall into four main categories.

1. ESG is not desirable, because it is a distraction
Perhaps the most prominent objection to ESG has 
been that it gets in the way of what critics see as the 
substance of what businesses are supposed to do: 
“make as much money as possible while conforming 
to the basic rules of the society,” as Milton Friedman 
phrased it more than a half-century ago.”11 Viewed 
in this perspective, ESG can be presented as 
something of a sideshow—a public-relations move, 
or even a means to cash in on the higher motives 
of customers, investors, or employees. ESG is 
something “good for the brand” but not foundational 
to company strategy. It is additive and occasional. 
ESG ratings and score provider MSCI, for example, 
found that nearly 60 percent of “say on climate” 
votes12 in 2021 were only one-time events; fewer 
than one in four of these votes were scheduled 
to have annual follow-ups.13 Other critics have 
cast ESG efforts as “greenwashing,” “purpose 
washing,”14 or “woke washing.”15 One Edelman 
survey, for example, reported that nearly three out of 
four institutional investors do not trust companies to 
achieve their stated sustainability, ESG, or diversity, 
equity, and inclusion (DEI) commitments.16

2. ESG is not feasible because it is intrinsically 
too difficult
 A second critique of ESG is that, beyond meeting 
the technical requirements of each of the E, S, and 
G components, striking the balance required to 
implement ESG in a way that resonates among 
multiple stakeholders is simply too hard. When 
solving for a financial return, the objective is clear: 
to maximize value for the corporation and its 
shareholders. But what if the remit is broader and 
the feasible solutions vastly more complex? Solving 

for multiple stakeholders can be fraught with trade-
offs and may even be impossible. To whom should 
a manager pay the incremental ESG dollar? To the 
customer, by way of lower prices? To the employees, 
through increased benefits or higher wages? To 
suppliers? Toward environmental issues, perhaps by 
means of an internal carbon tax? An optimal choice 
is not always clear. And even if such a choice existed, 
it is not certain that a company would have a clear 
mandate from its shareholders to make it.

3. ESG is not measurable, at least to any 
practicable degree
A third objection is that ESG, particularly as reflected 
in ESG scores, cannot be accurately measured. While 
individual E, S, and G dimensions can be assessed 
if the required, auditable data are captured, some 
critics argue that aggregate ESG scores have little 
meaning. The deficiency is further compounded by 
differences of weighting and methodology across 
ESG ratings and scores providers. For example, while 
credit scores of S&P and Moody’s correlated at  
99 percent, ESG scores across six of the most 
prominent ESG ratings and scores providers correlate 
on average by only 54 percent and range from  
38 percent to 71 percent.17 Moreover, organizations 
such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
can measure the same phenomena differently; for 
example, GRI considers employee training, in part, by 
amounts invested in training, while SASB measures 
by training hours. It is to be expected, therefore, 
that different ratings and scores providers—which 
incorporate their own analyses and weightings—
would provide diverging scores. Moreover, 
major investors often use their own proprietary 
methodologies that draw from a variety of inputs 
(including ESG scores), which these investors have 
honed over the years.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 20224. Even when ESG can be measured, there 
is no meaningful relationship with financial 
performance
The fourth objection to ESG is that positive 
correlations with outperformance, when they exist, 
could be explained by other factors and, in any event, 
are not causative. It would indeed challenge reason 
if ESG ratings across ratings and scores providers, 
measuring different industries, using distinct 
methodologies, weighting metrics differently, and 
examining a range of companies that operate in 
various geographies, all produced a near-identical 
score that almost perfectly matched company 
performance. Correlations with performance 
could be explained by multiple factors (for example, 
industry headwinds or tailwinds) and are subject 
to change.18 Several studies have questioned 
any causal link between ESG performance and 
financial performance.19 While, according to a recent 
metastudy, the majority of ESG-focused investment 
funds do outperform the broader market,20 some 
ESG funds do not, and even those companies and 
funds that have outperformed could well have an 
alternative explanation for their outperformance. 
(For example, technology and asset-light companies 
are often among broader market leaders in ESG 
ratings; because they have a relatively low carbon 
footprint, they tend to merit higher ESG scores.) The 
director of one recent study21 proclaimed starkly: 
“There is no ESG alpha.”22

In addition to these four objections, recent events 
and roiled markets have led some to call into 
question the applicability of ESG ratings at this 
point.23 It is true that the recognized, pressing need 
to strengthen energy security in the wake of the 
invasion of Ukraine may lead to more fossil-fuel 
extraction and usage in the immediate term, and the 
global collaboration required for a more orderly net-

zero transition may be jeopardized by the war and its 
aftermath. It is also likely that patience for what may 
be called “performative ESG,” as opposed to what 
may be called true ESG, will likely wear thin. True 
ESG is consistent with a judicious, well-considered 
strategy that advances a company’s purpose and 
business model (exhibit).

Yet, many companies today are making major 
decisions, such as discontinuing operations in 
Russia, protecting employees in at-risk countries, 
organizing relief to an unprecedented degree, and 
doing so in response to societal concerns. They 
also continue to commit to science-based targets 
and to define and execute plans for realizing 
these commitments. That indicates that ESG 
considerations are becoming more—not less—
important in companies’ decision making. 

Sustainable performance is not 
possible without social license
The fundamental issue that underlies each of the 
four ESG critiques is a failure to take adequate 
account of social license—that is, the perception by 
stakeholders that a business or industry is acting 
in a way that is fair, appropriate, and deserving 
of trust.24 It has become dogma to state that 
businesses exist to create value in the long term. 
If a business does something to destroy value 
(for example, misallocating resources on “virtue 
signaling,” or trying to measure with precision what 
can only be imperfectly estimated, at least to date, 
through external scores), we would expect that 
criticisms of ESG could resonate, particularly when 
one is applying a long-term, value-creating lens. 

But what some critics overlook is that a precondition 
for sustaining long-term value is to manage, and

address, massive, paradigm-shifting externalities. 
Companies can conduct their operations in a 
seemingly rational way, aspire to deliver returns 
quarter to quarter, and determine their strategy 
over a span of five or more years. But if they assume 
that the base case does not include externalities 
or the erosion of social license by failing to take 
externalities into account, their forecasts—and 
indeed, their core strategies—may not be achievable 
at all. Amid a thicket of metrics, estimates, targets, 
and benchmarks, managers can miss the very 
point of why they are measuring in the first place: 
to ensure that their business endures, with societal 
support, in a sustainable, environmentally viable way.

Accordingly, the responses to ESG critics 
coalesce on three critical points: the acute 
reality of externalities, the early success of some 
organizations, and the improvement of ESG 
measurements over time. And the case for ESG 
cannot be dismissed by connections between ESG 
scores and financial performance and changes 
in ESG scores over time. (For a discussion about 
ESG ratings and their relationship to financial 

performance, see sidebar, “ESG ratings: Does 
change matter?”) 

1. Externalities are increasing
Company actions can have meaningful 
consequences for people who are not immediately 
involved with the company. Externalities such as a 
company’s GHG emissions, effects on labor markets, 
and consequences for supplier health and safety are 
becoming an urgent challenge in our interconnected 
world. Regulators clearly take notice.25 Even if 
some governments and their agencies demand 
changes more quickly and more forcefully than 
others, multinational businesses, in particular, 
cannot afford to take a wait-and-see approach. To 
the contrary, their stakeholders expect them to 
take part now in how the regulatory landscape, 
and broader societal domain, will likely evolve. 
More than 5,000 businesses, for example, have 
made net-zero commitments as part of the United 
Nations’ “Race to Zero” campaign. Workers are also 
increasingly prioritizing factors such as belonging 
and inclusion as they choose whether to remain 
with their company or join a competing employer.26

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022ESG ratings: Does change matter?

Among the most sharply debated 
questions about environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) is the extent to 
which ESG, as measured by ratings, 
can offer meaningful insights about 
future financial or TSR performance—
particularly when ratings and scores 
providers use different, and sometimes 
mutually inconsistent, methodologies. 
A number of studies find a positive 
relationship between ESG ratings and 
financial performance.1 Other research 
suggests that while scoring well in ESG 
does not destroy financial value, the 
relationship between ESG ratings at 
any given time, and value creation at 
the identical time, can be tenuous or 
nonexistent.2 Because of the short time 
frame over which the topic has been 
studied, and the resulting lack of robust 
analyses, conclusions from the analyses 
should be tempered.3

of a change in ESG ratings. This approach 
mitigates issues deriving from differences 
among various ESG rating methodologies 
(assuming the methodologies are 
relatively consistent over time). It stands 
to reason that demonstrating real 
improvement—if reflected in the scores—
could, in turn, drive TSR outperformance 
for multiple reasons, including those we 
explore in this article. Our initial research 
indicates, however,  that it is too soon to 
tell.  We found that on average companies 
that show an improvement in ESG ratings 
over multiyear time periods may exhibit 
higher shareholder returns compared 
with industry peers in the period after the 
improvement in ESG scores. We found, 
too, that the effect of this result has 
increased in recent years (exhibit). This 
initial finding is in line with some of the 
recent academic research and was also 
generally consistent across data from 
multiple ratings and scores providers.  

In exploring the connection between 
ESG ratings and financial performance, 
another approach is to look at the effect 

Still, the findings are not yet conclusive. 
For example, only 54 percent of 

the companies we categorize as 
“improvers” and less than one-half of 
those categorized as “slight improvers” 
demonstrated a positive excess TSR. The 
research also does not prove causation. 
It is important to bear in mind that ESG 
scores are still evolving, observations in 
the aggregate may be less applicable to 
companies considered individually, and 
exogenous factors such as headwinds 
and tailwinds in industries and individual 
companies cannot be fully controlled for. 

Most important, this research does 
not explain the mechanism of TSR 
outperformance and whether the 
outperformance is sustainable. We 
know from decades of research that 
companies with a higher expected return 
on capital and growth are ultimately TSR 
outperformers and that there is clear, 
statistically significant correlation. Are 
ESG ratings a sign of greater expected 
resilience of margins in the transition, an 
indication of higher growth through green 
portfolios—or do they suggest something

else? Will these increased expectations 
relative to peers ultimately materialize, or 
will they revert to the mean? ESG ratings 
are very new compared with financial 
ratings, and therefore, it will take time 
for them to evolve. We will continue to 
research these questions as data sets 
increase and refinements to ESG scores 
continue to be refined. 

Regardless of current ratings scores, 
many companies are already advancing in 
ESG to improve their long-term financial 
performance. High performers consider 
and seek to learn from ESG ratings, 
but they do not get unduly distracted 
or make superficial changes merely to 
score higher. Companies should focus 
on ESG improvements that matter most 

to their business models, even if the 
improvements do not directly translate to 
higher ratings. 

Since conclusions about the relationship 
between ESG ratings and financial 
performance are not yet certain, they 
might not be compelling enough, on 
their own, to persuade executives to 
invest significant resources in ESG. But 
there is a tangible cost to waiting. In fact, 
companies should adopt a bias toward 
focusing on ESG today; if companies, 
particularly those with significant 
externalities (such as high-emitting 
industries), hold out for perfect data and 
a “flawless” rating process, they may not 
have a business in 20 to 30 years.

Esakia, and Felix Goltz, “‘Honey, I shrunk the ESG alpha’: 
Risk-adjusting ESG portfolio returns,” Journal of Investing,

3 When the ESG characteristic of a company changes, based 
on MSCI ESG data, it may be a useful financial indicator 
for generating alpha. Guido Giese et al., “Foundations of 
ESG investing: How ESG affects equity valuation, risk, and 
performance,” Journal of Portfolio Management, July 2019, 
Volume 45, Number 5. 

Many companies, in turn, are moving aggressively to 
reallocate resources and operate differently; nearly 
all are feeling intense pressure to change. Even 
before the Ukraine war induced dramatic company 
action, the pandemic had prompted companies to 
reconsider and change core business operations. 
Many have embarked on a similar path with respect 
to climate change. This pressure, visceral and 
tangible, is an expression of social license—and it 
has been made more pressing as rising externalities 
have become more urgent.  

2. Some companies have performed remarkably, 
showing that ESG success is indeed possible
Social license is not static, and companies do not 
earn the continued trust of consumers, employees, 
suppliers, regulators, and other stakeholders 
based merely upon prior actions. Indeed, earning 
social capital is analogous to earning debt or equity 
capital—those who extend it look to past results 
for insights about present performance and are 
most concerned with intermediate and longer-term 
prospects. Yet unlike traditional sources of capital, 

where there are often creative financing alternatives, 
there are ultimately no alternatives for companies 
that do not meet the societal bar and no prospect of 
business as usual, or business by workaround, under 
conditions of catastrophic climate change. 

Because ESG efforts are a journey, bumps along 
the way are to be expected. No company is perfect. 
Key trends can be overlooked, errors can be made, 
rogue behaviors can manifest themselves, and 
actions can have unintended consequences. But 
since social license is corporate “oxygen”—thus 
impossible to survive without it—companies cannot 
just wait and hope that things will all work out. 
Instead, they need to get ahead of future issues 
and events by building purpose into their business 
models and demonstrating that they benefit multiple 
stakeholders and the broader public. Every firm 
has an implicit purpose—a unique raison d’être that 
answers the question, “What would the world lose if 
this company disappeared?” Companies that embed 
purpose in their business model not only mitigate 
risk; they can also create value from their values. 

60

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022For example, Patagonia, a US outdoor-equipment 
and clothing retailer, has always been purpose 
driven—and announced boldly that it is “in business 
to save our home planet.” Natura &Co, a Brazil-
based cosmetics and personal-care company in 
business to “promote the harmonious relationship 
of the individual with oneself, with others and with 
nature,” directs its ESG efforts to initiatives such 
as protecting the Amazon, defending human rights, 
and embracing circularity. Multiple other companies, 
across geographies and industries, are using ESG 
to achieve societal impact and ancillary financial 
benefits, as well.

3. Measurements can be improved over time
While ESG measurements are still a work in 
progress, it is important to note that there have 
been advancements. ESG measurements will 
be further improved over time. They are already 
changing; there is a trend toward consolidation of 
ESG reporting and disclosure frameworks (though 
further consolidation is not inevitable). Private 
ratings and scores providers such as MSCI, Refinitiv, 
S&P Global, and Sustainalytics, for their part, are 
competing to provide insightful, standardized 
measures of ESG performance. 

There is also a trend toward more active regulation 
with increasingly granular requirements. Despite 
the differences in assessing ESG, the push 
longitudinally has been for more accurate and 

robust disclosure, not fewer data points or less 
specificity. It is worth bearing in mind, too, that 
financial accounting arose from stakeholder pull, 
not from spontaneous regulatory push, and did 
not materialize, fully formed, along the principles 
and formats that we see today. Rather, reporting 
has been the product of a long evolution—and a 
sometimes sharp, debate. It continues to evolve—
and, in the case of generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) reporting, continues to 
have differences. Those differences, reflecting how 
important these matters are to stakeholders, do not 
negate the case for rigorous reporting—if anything, 
they strengthen it. 

While the acronym ESG as a construct may have 
lost some of its luster, its underlying proposition 
remains essential at the level of principle. Names will 
come and go (ESG itself arose after CSR, corporate 
engagement, and similar terms), and these 
undertakings are by nature difficult and can mature 
only after many iterations. But we believe that the 
importance of the underlying ideas has not peaked; 
indeed, the imperative for companies to earn their 
social license appears to be rising. Companies must 
approach externalities as a core strategic challenge, 
not only to help future-proof their organizations but 
to deliver meaningful impact over the long term.

Does ESG really matter—and why?

How to make ESG real

While ESG is likely to evolve both in substance and name in the coming 
years, its underlying impulse is here to stay. Here’s how companies can 
take a more systematic and rewarding approach to ESG.

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022The ‘how’ of a company’s environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) proposition starts with recognizing 
what companies should be solving for: maintaining 
and reinforcing their social license to operate, in 
the face of rising externalities. Rising scrutiny of 
how companies address ESG means that a robust 
approach is more critical than ever, irrespective 
of whatever name one may choose to give to the 
attempt to address these externalities, whatever 
contours one may define for them at a given point, 
and whatever organizational or governance construct 
one may put in place for them. Indeed, we believe 
one may be agnostic to the term ESG but not to its 
underlying concerns.1

Not all aspects of “E,” “S,” and “G,” however, are 
priorities for all companies, and it is unrealistic to 
expect that companies do not have to make hard 
trade-offs within and among ESG dimensions, or that 
they can lead on every topic. It is therefore instructive 
to observe companies that approach ESG in a 
rigorous, strategy-driven, socially attuned way. We 
call these organizations “forward-looking companies.” 
They make ESG intrinsic to their strategy by defining, 
implementing, and refining a carefully constructed 
portfolio of ESG initiatives that connect to the core 
of what they do. Forward-looking companies also 
contribute to a competitive landscape where good 
corporate citizenship is marshaled against existential 
challenges, not least—but not only—climate change. 

When a company determines the dimensions of ESG 
where it wishes to be good and where it wishes to 
be excellent, it is making important decisions, with 
broader second- and third-order consequences. 
Forward-looking companies approach ESG 
decisions by seeking to gain a deep, evidence-based 
understanding of their own business and its broader 
potential effects. Since by now every major company 
has begun to embark on an ESG journey, and many 
have significant programs already under way, it is 
helpful to consider ESG progress in the context of a 
maturity curve. The ESG practices of today’s large 
companies generally cluster along three levels of 
ambition (Exhibit 1). 

Being forward looking in ESG necessarily calls for 
considering the needs of a range of stakeholders and 
society more broadly. Stakeholder demands are shifting, 
and these shifts can over time dramatically affect 
competitive dynamics. Nor is the rate of change linear. 
As external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and 
the war in Ukraine have shown, companies find it hard to 
move rapidly unless they have an ESG framework that is 
derived from, and deliberately advances, their strategy. 
Anticipating risks and opportunities and considering 
what value stakeholders have at stake requires 
continuous, judicious analysis; ESG is a process, not an 
outcome (Exhibit 2). 

The approach of forward-looking companies is 
marked by four reinforcing parts of mapping, defining, 
embedding, and engaging.  

The science of ESG mapping
The term “mapping” is used frequently in other 
competitive contexts. Mapping for ESG requires a 
thorough and inclusive exercise. The critical analysis is 
to figure out how the organization’s specific business 
model matches against each ESG dimension.

1. Considering what stakeholders have at stake
Comprehensive ESG mapping attempts to take 
account of who the important stakeholders are and 
what they value. Purpose is an enabler; it is much 
easier for a company to operationalize ESG when it 
has a clearly articulated corporate purpose, moored 
to the business model. It will not come as a surprise 
that forward-looking companies actively engage with 
their shareholders, whose capital is at risk. To unlock 
opportunities for all of their stakeholders, however, 
these companies tend to listen to a broad range of 
constituencies. 

Employees rank highly on any list of essential 
stakeholders. The benefits of engaged employees 
include heightened loyalty and a greater willingness 
to recommend the company to others.2 Engaged 
customers are also essential. Consumers hold 
companies and their brands accountable for the

Nuttall, and Krysta Biniek, McKinsey Quarterly, August 10, 2022.

allocation

• Tie ESG to employee incentives 

and evaluations

• Improve sustainability outcomes

• Ensure that ESG disclosures cover  

company’s full operations 

Impact

impact of their conduct on employees, society, and 
the environment. Though customer preferences 
can vary, there are indications about what is likely to 
matter more for consumers in the years ahead. Our 
research on Generation Z (born 1995–2010) shows 
that young consumers are particularly mindful of 
ethical consumption, transparency, authenticity, and 
equality.3 One study found that purpose-driven brands 
achieve more than twice the brand-value growth of 
brands that focus purely on profit generation.4

2. Identifying superpowers and vulnerabilities 
The second element of mapping is to identify 
a company’s superpowers and vulnerabilities. 
Superpowers are a company’s unique capabilities 
to have differential impact. Vulnerabilities are the 
foundational expectations that critical stakeholders 
will require a company to address, in light of its 
specific business model. Identifying superpowers 
and vulnerabilities requires answering questions such 
as, What do we bring to society that no one else can? 

What are the areas of dissonance, where we need to 
change practices to align strategy with our societal 
impact? What do we do that is irreplaceable? What 
“home field” advantage do we have? For example, 
Natura &Co is a Brazilian-based manufacturer and 
distributor of cosmetics and other personal-care 
products, with significant operations in Latin America, 
Europe, and the Middle East. Its superpower is 
channeling its “home turf” of the Amazon rainforest; it 
can tap into its highly motivated base of stakeholders 
to protect biodiversity and advance global solutions 
to climate change.

Forward-looking companies test and strengthen 
their ESG proposition by conducting exercises such 
as an “ESG teardown.” Teardowns—dismantling a 
product or service to learn more and to compare it 
with the offerings of rivals—have long been used 
in manufacturing. ESG teardowns analyze what a 
company is doing now, and why. Frequently, the 
exercise will surface reasons for some initiatives

that include “it seemed like a good idea at the time,” 
or “many companies seemed to be doing something 
similar.” Perhaps these explanations make sense in 
some cases, yet it is not possible to make a distinctive 
contribution by merely copying others—and at all 
events, companies have unique superpowers and 
vulnerabilities. 

Forward-looking companies carefully consider the 
dimensions in which they have a particular ability to 
excel and can distinguish them from dimensions where 
their abilities are comparable to others. For example, a 
multinational pharmaceutical company may focus on 
social metrics (such as accessibility and affordability), 
a renewables company may prioritize environmental 
metrics (such as reductions in greenhouse-gas 
emissions, for scopes 1, 2, and 3), and a food company 
may elevate an equal mix of environmental (emissions 
reductions, water use, and waste) and social metrics 
(nutrition, product quality, and safety). 

Thorough analysis of ESG quantifies both downside 
exposure to and upside opportunities. Forward-
looking companies measure gaps between their 
aspirations and achievements. They also focus most 
intently on mapping how well ESG is reflected in 
core business practices. One test that all companies 
can apply after they have arrived at a new ESG 
strategy is to determine and parse the internal 
commitments that they have not yet met—and to 

ask why they have failed to meet them. Companies 
can also inquire about whether board meetings are 
now being conducted differently, with the company’s 
ESG strategy applied to decision making; whether 
operating-level meetings are conducted differently; 
the extent to which ESG considerations are a factor in 
budgeting, capital allocation, and product choice; and 
whether some stakeholder groups are expressing 
particular concerns. 

3. Benchmarking regularly and judiciously
Finally, forward-looking companies are exacting 
about their choices of metrics and peer sets. They 
are also creative about analyses and research 
(including the use of research from academia and 
thought leaders). One informative inquiry tracked 
the degree to which companies “walked the talk” in 
their disclosures about broader stakeholders. It 
found that, controlling for sector-specific effects, 
stronger stakeholder language about the importance 
of stakeholders paired with stronger operating 
performance across a number of metrics over a 
three-year period.5

Forward-looking companies’ selection of peer sets 
is not constrained by traditional categorizations. 
While corporations may define themselves by sector, 
a wide range of stakeholders adopt a much broader 
approach. Prospective employees, for example, look 
across industries for companies they would consider

joining. There is, as well, a layer of nuance in choosing 
appropriate peer sets. Looking across geographies 
and industries is often instructive, but different 
geographies and industries require different analyses. 

The choices in ESG decision making
Forward-looking companies recognize that they 
cannot be distinctive by pursuing every initiative that 
qualifies as ESG. To the contrary: because they have 
a clear understanding of their strategy, and their 
own strengths and gaps, they focus on identifying 
initiatives that matter most to their business models. 
ESG is an essential strategic concern, which means it 
affects how and where a company competes.  

1. Considering high jumps and long jumps
There are two critical decisions that companies 
confront as they seek to enhance their readiness to 
address externalities along the ESG dimensions. The 
first is to decide on high jumps: the levels a company 
must reach to meet its ESG bar. This is higher than 
a regulatory bar, such as disclosure standards, 
environmental compliance, tax obligations, and wage 
scales—all of which must be met in every case. ESG 
is “next level” performance; it addresses, for instance, 
societal insistence on a living wage, environmental 
demands for net-zero emissions, and communal 
principles of diversity. These expectations will likely 
continue to move higher (even though a degree of 
volatility is to be expected in this regard as well).

The second step is to decide on a company’s long 
jumps: the one or two ESG areas where the company 
can take a leadership role and, ideally, affect other 
players in its ecosystem and beyond. Long jumps are 
reached by drawing from a company’s superpowers. 
Depending upon a company’s ecosystem, it may be 
uniquely positioned to facilitate notable social impact 
among multiple businesses worldwide. For example, 
Maersk founded the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller 
Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, which consists of 
18 strategic partners from across the shipping value 
chain that accelerate carbon-neutral solutions for the 
shipping industry.

The concepts of high jumps and long jumps on the 
one hand, and superpowers and vulnerabilities on 
the other, are distinct. While both are rooted in a 
company’s unique business model and endowment, 
high jumps and long jumps are the specific courses 
of action a company takes in light of its superpowers 
and vulnerabilities. For example, Walmart has the 
prominent superpower of a large, robust network 
of suppliers. It uses this superpower to make a 
long jump in sustainability. The company instituted 
Project Gigaton, a collaborative program that enables 
suppliers to reduce their carbon footprints by a 
collective one billion metric tons (one gigaton) of 
greenhouse gases by 2030. Thousands of suppliers 
take part in Project Gigaton by setting targets, 
reporting on progress, and sharing knowledge. By 
2020, the project had already reached more than  
40 percent of its goal. 

2. Thinking systematically about ESG trade-offs
Forward-looking companies do not ignore trade-offs 
when approaching ESG. Rather, as they consider 
their unique business models, they are clear about 
benefits and costs—including the costs of inaction. 

One example is how a company may approach 
employee compensation. Paying above-market 
compensation could seem, at first, to be value 
destroying for shareholders, by potentially reducing 
investors’ returns, particularly in the short term, 
yet employee satisfaction can clearly drive better 
financial performance.6 Many companies find that by 
treating employees better, including by paying them 
well, they can not only increase productivity but also 
foster greater trust. Research suggests that this can 
become a source of competitive advantage.7

Yet capital and time are finite. At some point, investing 
a marginal dollar in one constituency (say, employees, 
by means of higher salaries) could require increasing 
prices for another constituency (consumers). 
Elevating management time for one ESG initiative 
(for example, reducing waste) could detract from time 
that can be spent on other initiatives (for instance, 
community education). There is no one, clearly 

6  For example, see Alex Edmans, “Does the stock market fully value intangibles? Employee satisfaction and equity prices,” Journal of Financial Economics, 
September 2011, Volume 101, Number 3.
7  Alex Edmans, “The link between job satisfaction and firm value, with implications for corporate social responsibility,” Academy of Management 
Perspectives, November 2012, Volume 26, Number 4.

66

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022 
marked path that every business can follow. But there 
generally is a common marker that distinguishes 
how forward-looking companies execute ESG: they 
consider thoroughly, choose deliberately, and then 
act boldly. As part of that approach, forward-looking 
companies assess scenarios for not investing 
in a given area; they analyze the values at risk to 
determine the costs of standing still. They recognize 
that social expectations constantly evolve. 

3. Measuring and assessing
A key part of making ESG real is not to measure 
for the sake of measuring but instead to measure 
what matters. Effective performance management 
in ESG, like effective performance management in 
other contexts, approaches shorter-term metrics 
with a view toward achieving longer-term, strategic 
goals. It uses clear milestones, pays careful attention 
to meaningful KPIs, and elevates objectives that tie 
directly to the business model (for example, water-
use reduction, removal of antibiotics from fresh 
produce, or replacement of diesel machines with 
electric machines in warehouses).

Assessing progress is most effective when it is done 
regularly and, with robust data analytics, information 
can be updated very rapidly. Companies that have a 
considered process in place to measure their ESG 
performance are better positioned to respond even 
in times of rapid change. As the saying goes, “there 
are decades when weeks happen, and weeks when 
decades happen.” An informed perspective enables 
forward-thinking companies to move quickly as 
realities shift.

The approach to ESG implementation
Just as forward-looking companies make informed 
choices about ESG based upon their unique business 
model, they also act purposely to operationalize ESG 
throughout the organization.

1. Syncing ESG with operations 
It can be tempting to approach corporate purpose 
and then ESG sequentially: that is, to consider that 
companies should first clarify their purpose, and then 
create ESG initiatives that accord with their purpose. 
But it is rare for large, established companies—which 

operate under a range of priorities, urgencies, and 
constraints—to be able to operate in this way. For 
example, after the big-box retailer Best Buy’s former 
chairman and CEO, Hubert Joly, had implemented a 
remarkable turnaround at the company, he observed:

“The question is often, ‘So where do you start and how do 
you sequence?’ The logical part of our mind would have 
us start with purpose, then derive the strategy: anchor it 
in purpose, and transform the organization on that basis. 

“My personal experience is different. When we started 
the turnaround, I was very clear about my philosophy, 
which was that profit is not the purpose. Purpose is 
to contribute to the common good. But we did not 
spend time in the first three years of the turnaround 
on refining our purpose. We spent the time saving a 
ship that was sinking, by addressing key operational-
performance drivers.”8

That does not mean that companies should move 
ESG to the back burner. There are opportunities for 
companies to think comprehensively about how they 
can advance major ESG initiatives as part of their 
core strategic plan, across 5Ps. We have identified 
key sources of opportunities:

1.  portfolio strategy and products: the products 
and services an organization provides, and 
the “where to play” and “how to play” choices it 
makes to best serve its customers 

2.  people and culture: the talent—and the talent 

management approach—a firm deploys 

3. 

 processes and systems: the operational 
processes it adapts to meet ESG-related targets 

4. 

 performance metrics: the target metrics and 
incentives used to measure what the company 
wishes to achieve, how it is progressing, and 
the way it creates and distributes incentives to 
realize ESG initiatives 

5.  positions and engagement: how the 

organization aligns its external positions 
and affiliations to be consistent with, and 
consistently deliver on, its ESG priorities 

8  “Leading with purpose and humanity: A conversation with Hubert Joly,” McKinsey Quarterly, June 18, 2020.

How to make ESG real

67

 
Depending upon the company and its business 
model, the range of key stakeholders can include key 
regulators and governmental actors, as well as other 
companies, and the range of initiatives can be far-
reaching. Companies that have demonstrable success 
in ESG make deliberate choices in this regard.

2. Following through on initiatives to ensure impact
Forward-thinking companies then follow through on 
their initiatives. When ESG fits squarely within strategy, 
it is likely to have strong support from stakeholders 
within and beyond the organization. Consider the 
clothing and outdoor-gear company Patagonia, 
which has made protecting the natural environment 
part of its core mission. Initiatives such as facilitating 
connections to environmental groups; pledging 1 
percent of sales to the preservation and restoration 
of the natural environment; and using only renewable 
electricity for its retail stores, distribution centers, and 
regional and global offices function in concert. 

One powerful way companies can follow through is 
with incentives. This includes monetary incentives; 
indeed, a growing number of corporations are 
crafting compensation packages, particularly 
for senior leaders, that condition a portion of 
compensation on achieving specific ESG objectives 
(for example, emissions reductions). But monetary 
incentives are not the only way to encourage positive 
behavior, nor always the most effective.

An additional lever is “nudging,” which has been 
validated by behavioral science. Nudges can 
encourage energy savings and waste reduction, 
for example, by promoting inclusive behaviors, 
reminding employees to be mindful of their carbon 
footprint, or encouraging them to recycle. Forward-
looking companies find that by consistently sharing 
with employees and other stakeholders how the 
organization is progressing along their prioritized 
objectives, such as diversity or sustainability—
information that can be presented clearly in 
standardized reports—they can make ESG initiatives 
part of the business’s daily operations. Companies 
can celebrate teams that deliver on ESG expectations, 
or they can spotlight employees who contribute 
measurably to the organization’s ESG initiatives. 

3. Discerning what the numbers do—and do not—
say about ESG 
Forward-looking companies find that their ESG 
metrics become more robust—and more refined—the 
longer and more consistently they use them. They 
also think carefully about which external ESG ratings 
agencies or score providers they should track most 
closely. The optimum is usually two or three and, in 
particular, the two or three that are most practicable 
for a business model and help companies meet their 
objectives. Forward-looking companies are careful 
not to conflate achieving high scores with realizing 
specific, strategic goals.  

Developments on ESG metrics are shifting in real time. 
The US regulatory environment is fluid. Outside of the 
United States, the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) completed its consolidation with the 
Value Reporting Foundation in August 2022, formalizing 
the new International Sustainability Standards Board 
(ISSB).9 ISSB houses the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board standards and the Integrated 
Reporting Framework. Implementation is usually 
done via the International Organization of Securities 
Commissions, whose members set standards as 
listing requirements on their exchanges.

Each of these organizations has a mandate to 
protect investors and markets. As well, the European 
Union has asked the European Financial Reporting 
Advisory Group to propose reporting standards for 
its Non-Financial Reporting Directive, with a view of 
materiality on both the investor and civil-society level. 
Because the European Union supports the IFRS/
ISSB initiative, there is grounds to hope that any 
overlap between IFRS and the European Union will 
be limited. Though it is not certain that the trajectory 
will continue, ratings have been converging. The 
next, great challenge will likely be impact-weighted 
accounting that reflects a company’s financial, social, 
and environmental performance.  

The engagement and dialogue of  
social license 
While it is relatively easy to map and measure how 
ESG initiatives align with a business model, it is much 

9   “IFRS Foundation completes consolidation with Value Reporting Foundation,” August 1, 2022.

68

McKinsey on Risk Number 13, October 2022harder to track—and to analyze—the maintaining 
of social license.10 Companies that are focused on 
making ESG real have learned, first, to encourage 
open dialogues with stakeholders rather than to 
shy away from them; second, to speak directly to 
stakeholder concerns by showing how their ESG 
efforts connect to and advance the company’s 
strategy; and, third, to maintain a regular cadence in 
ESG reporting. 

1. Using ESG engagement to sharpen strategy
Forward-looking companies think carefully about 
communications—not just in terms of what resonates 
with investors, but with a range of stakeholders; and 
not just communications for the sake of announcing 
to others but in order to learn, become smarter, and 
improve as an organization. Employees are a key 
constituency and are invariably an important source 
of insight. Companies can also continuously improve 
by engaging through trade groups and alliances 
(the choice of which is itself a rigorous and iterative 
process), both to better inform their own views and to 
accelerate impact at scale. 

Having an informed sense of opinion helps inure 
companies to becoming overly defensive. Committed 
performers embrace the reality that engagement 
can be a little bumpy. Dick’s Sporting Goods, for 
example—the largest sporting-goods retail company 
in the United States—endured tremendous pushback 
when it announced in 2018 that it was discontinuing 
the sale of assault-style firearms and high-capacity 
ammunition magazines. The company absorbed both 
immediate top-line losses and a drop in its share 
price. Yet the company continued to engage openly 
with consumers, employees, and investors, stuck to 
its purpose, and soon saw its earnings and market 
capitalization surpass previous levels. 

2. Showing investors the business proposition 
Investors increasingly seek more information about 
and insist upon more accountability for ESG. They 
also need to know how a company’s ESG initiatives 
complement and strengthen its strategic plan. 
Forward-looking companies demonstrate clearly how 
specific ESG initiatives flow into the business model 
and have hard metrics to demonstrate progress. They 

can also take committed actions such as establishing 
a task force to identify and collect ESG data points 
for reporting, dedicating full-time outreach and 
communications employees to the investor relations 
team, thoroughly integrating sustainability into 
company reports (including the annual report), and 
describing specific ESG initiatives and performance 
against those initiatives in investor presentations. 

Companies have also incorporated ESG directly 
into capital raising, particularly by issuing green- or 
sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs). These securities 
feature structural or financial provisions on 
predefined KPIs, measured against sustainability 
targets. For example, England-based fashion house 
Burberry announced a medium-term sustainability 
bond in 2020 to finance sustainability-linked 
projects. That same year, Novartis priced €1.85 billion 
of SLBs, linked to specific ESG targets. The key, of 
course, in choosing whether to use such instruments 
is to consider how they could complement and 
advance a company’s ESG priorities.

Regardless of capital mix, there are clear advantages 
to greater transparency. Stakeholders, particularly 
(but not only) investors and regulators, expect and 
increasingly demand detailed disclosures. While 
regulations vary across countries and jurisdictions, 
the global trend is toward more robust information. 
Companies that succeed in implementing business-
driven ESG initiatives, meeting hard targets along the 
way, demonstrate to stakeholders that they can build 
and sustain value in the context of regulatory change. 
ESG is already core to their operating model.

3. Making cadence core to the dialogue
Finally, forward-looking companies find that not just 
the quality of interactions with stakeholders and the 
detail of information shared with them but also the 
pace of communications is essential. Delaying ESG 
reporting could be interpreted as a signal of lesser 
commitment.

Meeting a steady ESG cadence is a developable skill, 
and it is improved the more it is practiced. Mohandas 
Gandhi once observed that “your actions become your 
habits; your habits become your values; your values 

10   A call for impact-weighted financial accounts to reflect a company’s environmental, social, and financial performance is already building. See, for example, 

“Impact-weighted accounts,” Harvard Business School.

become your destiny.” That is very much the case 
with ESG reporting. When ESG is core to the business 
model, reporting on ESG becomes part of the ordinary 
course of doing business. External shocks are less 
likely to present an undue burden on ESG reporting. 
Just as well-managed companies have accounting 
information quickly available because it helps them 
discern their business performance, forward-looking 
companies have ESG data at the ready before and 
during challenging periods. 

Most companies are engaged in an ESG journey. 
But a culture of continuous improvement in ESG is 
unlikely to take hold at a company unless ESG is not 
just taken seriously but systematized and tightly 
linked to the company’s purpose. Forward-looking 
companies approach ESG in a rigorous, evidence-
based, and well-considered way. They increasingly 
and deliberately incorporate and advance ESG 
considerations as core to their business model—to 
enable a more sustainable business and to make 
ESG real.

To meet the security requirements to face evolving 
threats and changing technology, organizations 
must adapt and shift how they previously managed 
cybersecurity. While technical controls and 
capabilities still remain a priority and a commonly 
accepted method of securing the environment, 
adapting to a new approach for hiring cybersecurity 
talent can solve a leading concern of many leaders in 
a cost-optimized and risk-effective manner.

Hiring cybersecurity talent normally uses a top-down 
approach that fills most senior roles first before filling 
roles further down the organizational chart. However, 
because of cybersecurity worker shortages and the 
need to focus on specific capabilities from a talent 
pool—sometimes with nontraditional backgrounds—
the standard hiring approach is less effective in this 
competitive job market. 

While one answer may be to throw money at the 
problem and hire as many workers as possible to 
grow your organization over time, this approach 
does not necessarily lead to reduced risk. No matter 
what approach to resourcing companies use, the 
changing nature of cyberrisk means companies need 
to manage talent flexibly to adapt to new threats.

By preplanning and understanding the 
organization’s cybersecurity needs holistically,  
it is possible to lay out a hiring road map that 
focuses specifically on the most critical cyber 
initiatives. Assessing risks, understanding priorities, 

and then filling those roles based on capabilities 
and associated skills can reduce risk and protect 
business value.

Apply talent to value protection
Leading organizations understand the impact and 
likelihood of cybersecurity and technology risks and 
seek to reduce those risks to enable the business. 
It is not just about what capabilities to prioritize, it 
is also about what skills are needed, if you can find 
those skills from within the organization, and if you 
need to hire or outsource.

The talent-to-value-protection approach defines 
the most important roles that show a maximum 
reduction in risk or create the greatest amount of 
security value (Exhibit 1). Priority roles should be 
filled with the right skills to eliminate risk as soon 
as possible, utilizing all resources, capabilities, and 
recruiting efforts. 

As a case in point, an organization undergoing 
a cyber transformation sought to fill more than 
150 roles across all capabilities. After applying 
the talent-to-value-protection approach, the 
company’s leaders prioritized hiring based on 
critical business risks and what knowledge and 
skills were required first to secure the business.

Using talent-to-value protection allows you to 
move in the right direction and reduce risk through

focused hiring and talent development. The strategy 
helps identify which skills and associated roles 
are the highest priority to reduce cybersecurity 
risk—or, in other words, which can demonstrate the 
most “return on risk investment.” It allows you to 
hire the right person at the right time—ensuring that 
personnel spending is aligned with where it should 
be based on growth aspirations.

Understanding where to focus recruiting efforts 
is important, as the global dearth of qualified 
security personnel available to hire requires creative 
approaches to finding talent. 

Shortage of cybersecurity workers
There is a global shortage of 2.72 million skilled 
cybersecurity workers, according to the 2021 
Cybersecurity Workforce Study by the International 
Information System Security Certification 
Consortium, or (ISC)2. Cybersecurity professionals 
said in the study that the workforce gap remains the 
number-one barrier to meeting their organizations’ 
security needs. Sixty percent of respondents report 
that a cybersecurity staffing shortage is placing 
their organizations at risk. The consequences of 
cybersecurity staff shortages are real and create 
challenges for organizational success (Exhibit 2). 

Depending on your type of organization, talent-to-
value protection can work in a few different ways:

1.  Early-stage cybersecurity organizations. For 
organizations just beginning their security 
journeys, the first focus is getting key players 
in place and setting up program management 
capabilities. This approach focuses on executing 
strategic initiatives and improvement activities 
in parallel; it fills management roles proactively 
and overweighs the importance of leaders (for 
example, managers and directors) to manage 
controls and operate capabilities.  

2.  Steady-state organizations. For organizations 

with well-established cybersecurity capabilities, 
the main priority is to make continued 
improvements to protect against emerging risks. 
This approach focuses on targeted improvement 
opportunities; it emphasizes high-impact 
experts or key frontline employees and places 
less weight on managers and directors because 
of the existing leadership structure. 

3.  Transforming organizations. Companies 

undergoing transformations prioritize new hires 
and skills against where the new risk will be 
or to protect the most valued part of the new 
business. This approach prioritizes new hires 
to safeguard the value gained from a business 
transformation, finding new talent or new skills 
to reduce potential risk.

The first priority is to understand what 
capabilities directly impact the systems 
and processes that drive business value: 
the crown jewels.

Protect the crown jewels
The first priority is to understand what capabilities 
directly impact the systems and processes that 
drive business value: the crown jewels. The 
crown jewels are the assets, the data, and the 
applications that are most critical to business 
value and operations. Implementing a risk-based 
approach to protecting these assets requires 
mapping required controls and selecting the right 
people to implement them. Organizations can use 
existing frameworks, such as the National Initiative 
for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) led by the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST), to focus the organization on the types 
of skills needed for priority controls. This self-
examination helps identify personnel who can be 
upskilled or determine when new hires are needed.

For example, a large Latin American oil and gas 
company reprioritized its cybersecurity spending, 
capability development, and leadership after 
analyzing its crown jewels. The organization 
identified what mattered most and clearly defined 
the most critical risks. This crown jewel identification 
effort helped provide an understanding of the most 
critical talent needs and allowed the organization to 
build a targeted recruitment campaign to build its 
team’s capabilities.

As organizations across all industries race to 
defend their business value, it is critical that they 
accelerate to close gaps on controls to reduce risk 
and stay ahead of evolving attackers. According 
to a 2021 McKinsey survey, only 10 percent of 
organizations were found to be approaching 
advanced cybersecurity functions, while 
20 percent surpassed mature cybersecurity, which 

left 70 percent yet to fully advance to a mature 
approach—further highlighting the need to prioritize 
for risk-reducing activities that focus on value 
protection first (Exhibit 3).1

Hiring based on assumptions
Less mature organizations often assume they 
must hire based on cyber roles, regardless of the 
specific risks they face. Talent-to-value protection 
focuses on hiring or training the right personnel 
at the right time, bringing risk in line with the risk 
appetite of the organization.

Too often, chief information security officers 
(CISOs), chief information officers (CIOs), and vice 
presidents of security are inundated by the daily 
firestorm of cyber activity. Using talent-to-value 
protection helps leaders gain clarity on where to 
apply resources to best reduce risk. Instead, leaders 
can focus on laying out a road map to identify the 
top security priorities and pair talent against them. 
Leaders can progressively reduce risk in key areas 
rather than attempting to mitigate it all at once.

A three-step approach to implementing 
talent-to-value protection
This approach requires a collaborative effort to 
understand and communicate what the risk is, what 
will reduce that risk, and who will be needed to 
reduce that risk. Organizations can use a three-step 
approach to adopt a talent-to-value-protection 
framework. First, identify the most important 
cybersecurity activities based on the needs of the 
organization and most pressing risks that must be 
mitigated. Second, define the most important roles

that lead to maximum risk reduction. Third, build 
job descriptions for the priority roles and determine 
whether upskilling or hiring is the best option for 
each position.

Step 1: Identifying prioritized activities. Through 
risk modeling and assigning scores to potential 
vulnerabilities based on risk, talent-to-value 
protection makes it possible to create a list of 
activities to identify top priorities needed to 
execute on the security strategy. Each organization 
assigns scores differently—but all should work to 
assess risk based on the business or operational 
impact. Risk scores combine the likelihood and 
intent of an attacker to act and how vulnerable 
the organization is to that particular risk. For 
example, a technology organization realized after 
risk modeling that cloud compromise was one 
of its top cyberrisks, requiring the company to 
prioritize activities that brought down the most risk, 
including implementing cloud security controls 
over on-premises ones. Through this identification, 
it then became possible to match activities with 

roles needed to hire, which required upskilling, and 
which should be outsourced.

Step 2: Defining priority roles. The next step 
would be to define and prioritize security roles 
needed to fulfill the top risk-based priorities. For 
the organization mentioned above, it became a 
priority to fill cloud security roles to execute the 
activities necessary to implement the most critical 
cloud controls. Once priority roles are defined, it is 
possible to create the job descriptions of what the 
company needs in each role. 

Step 3: Building job descriptions and determining 
to upskill or hire. The final step is to determine 
if the priority role should be filled by upskilling 
existing employees or hiring new talent. One way 
to do this is to develop a job and role architecture 
that is linked to the organization’s security services 
catalog. Security service catalogs can be built 
around functional groups like cybersecurity 
operations, governance, engineering, and service 
groupings like cloud security or data governance.

The job and role architecture organizes jobs into 
families, functions, positions, and roles. Roles  
can end up assigned a category and specialty  
area sourced from well-known frameworks like 
NIST/NICE.

Each job description for the priority roles should 
be described in detail: first, by building a high-level 
summary of tasks, skills, and background for the 
person who will fill the role; second, by writing role 
details; third, by identifying the tasks, knowledge, 
skills, and abilities relevant to the role.

When the job descriptions for the priority roles 
are complete, leaders can analyze who in their 
current cybersecurity team could fit well in those 
roles. In some cases, it is faster and less expensive 
to upskill that team member through training. 
Sometimes, upskilling is not feasible. In that case, 
leaders can use the detailed job description to 
jump-start the hiring search—with high confidence 
in the type of individual they need to recruit. For 
one technology company, building and filling a 
variety of cloud-security-engineer job descriptions 
was a priority. The company quickly recognized a 
need to hire additional cloud security roles after 
analyzing the team’s knowledge and skills using 
NIST/NICE frameworks and seeing a gap in the 
ability to reduce key risks. 

In-house or outsource
Even with this approach, building an in-house, 
organization-specific cybersecurity team may not 
be feasible due to available talent, resourcing, or 
another reason. Sometimes it makes sense to 
outsource talent to accelerate implementation and 
scale security support faster. For example, while 
undergoing a large-scale cyber transformation, 
an oil producer prioritized outsourcing security 
operations given its geography and the skills that 
existed on the security team, thereby reducing risk.

The CISO, who had a strong cybersecurity 
background, built a lean team of several program 
managers with a general understanding of 
cybersecurity. Outside of this small team, all other 
cybersecurity functions were outsourced. By 
understanding what the organization needed and 
where to hire talent versus purchase services, the 
company was able to hit its cybersecurity maturity 
targets by its deadlines and grow its operational-
technology security to new levels. 

Template to success
Talent-to-value protection creates a template for 
the roles and the needs of an organization where 
companies can start to create a plan on how to 
attract, retain, and train talent and find the gaps 
within their security programs and talent pool. It 
helps prioritize who the organization needs to 
target for recruiting and how to focus on retaining 
the most critical personnel. It helps identify new 
cybersecurity requirements—helping determine 
whether those needs can be met by upskilling 
employees. If the organization cannot upskill its 
teammates, it then can go hire.

Talent-to-value protection helps the company 
understand what it needs, who it needs to hire, and 
when. Leaders learn the job specifications and the 
jobs they have to hire for, which allows them to say,  
“I don’t need a cloud security manager; instead, I 
need cloud security architects with experience 
shifting workloads to the cloud.”

In this era of a lack of qualified security personnel, 
talent-to-value protection allows organizations 
to be more strategic about their hiring. By tying 
this into the risk-based approach, an organization 
will have a prioritized list of roles to hire to build a 
secure enterprise.
