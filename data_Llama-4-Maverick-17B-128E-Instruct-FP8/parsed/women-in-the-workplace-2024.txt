ABOUT THE STUDY

Women in the Workplace is the largest study on the state of women in 
corporate America.1 For this 10th anniversary report, we analyzed data 
from the past decade to better understand progress, decline, and 
stagnation in women’s representation and experiences. Over the last 10 
years, more than 1,000 companies have participated in the study and over 
480,000 people were surveyed on their workplace experiences. In 2024, 
we collected information from 281 participating organizations employing 
over 10 million people, surveyed more than 15,000 employees, and 
conducted interviews with people of diverse identities, including women 
of color, LGBTQ+ women, and women with disabilities.2 In 2015, 
LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Company launched the annual study to give 
companies insights and tools to advance gender diversity in the 
workplace.

3  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: INTRODUCTION

After 10 years, the path forward 
for corporate America is clear: 
stay committed and keep going 

As we reﬂect on what’s happened in corporate America over the last decade, three things are true. 
Companies took action, and this led to important progress—more women in leadership, better 
policies for employees, and increased eﬀorts to foster inclusion. Change is hard and messy, and 
we’re somewhere in the middle of the shifts needed to ﬁx the pipeline and make the culture of 
work more equitable. If you look closely at the numbers, gains are more fragile and less extensive 
than they ﬁrst appear, which means companies need to push further. 

Taken altogether, the scorecard for corporate America is mixed, but with enough bright spots 
to believe many organizations have momentum. We would be cautiously optimistic about the 
future, if it weren’t for one glaring ﬁnding in this year’s study: company commitment to diversity 
is declining. At a moment when companies should be doubling down on their eﬀorts, 
there are early signs they are pulling back.

As we look ahead to the next 10 years of women in the workplace, our ask of companies is simple: 
keep going. Over the last decade, women have remained ambitious and committed to their jobs. 
Now, we need companies to stay ambitious and committed to the important work they’ve started. 
We believe corporate America can do better, and we know women deserve better. 

PART 1

PART 1

A 10-YEAR LOOK AT WOMEN’S REPRESENTATION

There has been real 
progress—but it's 
surprisingly fragile

Over the past decade, there have been important gains for women at every level of the corporate 
pipeline, particularly in senior leadership.3 This progress matters: research shows that companies 
with more women in leadership beneﬁt from greater innovation, healthier cultures, and stronger 
performance.4 And in addition to oﬀering valuable skills and perspectives, women leaders inspire 
the next generation of women to make their mark.

However, the pipeline is not as healthy as the numbers suggest. At the beginning, too few women—  
and especially women of color—are advancing into management positions. Over the last several 
years, the primary driver of progress for women in senior leadership has been a reduction in line 
roles. And at the highest level—the C-suite—what drove gains in representation will be nearly 
impossible to replicate in the years to come.

At the current rate of progress, it will take almost 50 years to reach parity for all women in corporate 
America—and that assumes companies can translate their somewhat precarious momentum into 
more substantial and sustainable gains.

5  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: WOMEN'S REPRESENTATION

Women have made meaningful gains in 
representation over the past decade 

Over the past 10 years, women’s representation has increased at every level. Most notably, 
women today make up 29 percent of C-suite positions, compared to just 17 percent in 2015. 
But progress has been much slower earlier in the pipeline, at the entry and manager levels.

Women’s representation increased across the pipeline from 2015 to 2024

Change in representation of women (2015–2024) and of white women and women of color (2017*–2024)5 

Women of color remain vastly underrepresented in corporate America. 
Women of color have experienced larger relative gains over the past several 
years. But given their signiﬁcant underrepresentation to start, they still have 
a long way to go to reach parity with white women. Women of color hold just 
7 percent of C-suite roles, compared to white women’s 22 percent.

A closer look at the 2024 corporate pipeline

As in years past, women remain underrepresented across the pipeline. 
And this gender gap in representation persists regardless of race and 
ethnicity. Simply put, men always outnumber women.

Women continue to face barriers at the beginning of the pipeline

Women remain less likely than men to be hired into entry-level roles, which leaves them underrepresented from the very 
beginning. Then, at the ﬁrst critical step up to manager, women are far less likely to get promoted, and this is not improving. 
For every 100 men promoted to manager in 2018, 79 women were promoted. And this year, just 81 women were. As a result 
of this “broken rung,” men signiﬁcantly outnumber women at the manager level, which makes it nearly impossible for 
companies to support sustained progress at more senior levels.

Women are still underrepresented from the get-go …9

At my previous job, I had all the 
credentials and had been at the 
company for years. I applied to 
become a manager and got passed 
over. The guy who got the job didn’t 
have all the credentials, didn’t have 
all the experience, and had never 
been a manager before.”

For every 1 woman added to a staﬀ 

role between 2018 and 2024, roughly 

six men in line positions were lost. 

10  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: WOMEN'S REPRESENTATION

Women’s progress in senior leadership is more fragile than it appears

Women made modest but meaningful gains at the VP and SVP levels from 2018 to 2024, mostly due to 
their growth in staﬀ roles. But the main driver of the increase in women's representation at these levels 
was a reduction in the number of line roles, which disproportionately impacted men given they hold more 
of these positions.13 

In the C-suite, women’s progress was even less sustainable. While the reduction of line roles was still a factor, 
the primary reason women’s representation increased was that companies, on average, added a staﬀ role 
and were more likely to hire a woman into this new position.14 Since companies cannot add new staﬀ roles 
indeﬁnitely, this is not a viable path to parity.

11  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: WOMEN'S REPRESENTATION

Despite progress, parity for all women is 
almost 50 years away

At the current pace of progress, it will take 22 years to reach parity 
for white women—and more than twice as long for women of color. 
Put another way, it will take 48 years for the representation of white 
women and women of color in senior leadership to reﬂect their share 
of the U.S. population. This is true parity for all women.

To achieve this, companies will need to maintain their current rate of 
progress, which means addressing weak spots in their pipeline. For 
most companies, this means ﬁxing the broken rung once and for all, 
investing more energy in developing women leaders, and holding 
themselves accountable for more substantive progress in the C-suite.

Years to parity estimates were modeled using data from participating 
companies. Current C-suite and SVP representation was projected 
forward using simulations until parity was reached.18

A 10-YEAR LOOK AT COMPANY PRACTICES

Despite making important 
headway, companies still 
have critical work to do

Over the last 10 years, companies have taken steps to support the advancement of women and 
make the workplace more equitable. And employees recognize this: a majority think women have 
more opportunities to advance and point to companies’ increased eﬀorts to make the workplace 
more inclusive.

Companies have put more practices in place to de-bias hiring and performance reviews, two of 
the biggest levers of employee advancement. They have prioritized equity and inclusion with 
managers and invested more heavily in training employees to recognize bias and practice 
allyship. Flexibility—a top priority for most employees—has become the norm in many companies. 
And perhaps most critically, far more companies now oﬀer supports to parents, caregivers, and 
employees facing health issues.19

However, there is clear evidence that companies need to push further. For example, fewer 
companies are investing in career development and sponsorship programs that address the unique 
challenges of women and women of color. And although well intended, company eﬀorts to activate 
employees—who have a critical role to play in changing the culture of work—have not translated 
into enough action.

14  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: COMPANY PRACTICES

Companies are doing more to de-bias hiring and 
performance reviews—but need to go further 

Companies have implemented more practices to make hiring and performance reviews fair. However, 
there is room for improvement. Only about 1 in 4 companies have adopted all of the core practices 
experts recommend, and companies with the full array of practices in place tend to make the greatest 
strides in advancing women.20 Additionally, given persistent weak spots in the pipeline, companies 
would be well served to apply rigor to existing practices and try more innovative approaches.

Companies have scaled back programs designed to advance women

Women face distinct barriers that programs to develop and advance women can help address.23 Yet there’s 
been a decline in career development, mentorship, and sponsorship programs geared toward women—and 
relatively few companies track the outcomes of these programs. In addition, there has been a sharp decline 
in recruiting and internship programs focused on women. And in all cases, companies are investing in fewer

Equity and inclusion

Women today are more likely than men to encounter demeaning or dismissive comments at work that call their competence 

into question or undermine their leadership abilities. These daily slights—often referred to as microaggressions—are rooted 

in bias and directed at a person because of their gender, race, or other aspects of their identity. Microaggressions remain 

just as common today as ﬁve years ago—and are most acute for LGBTQ+ women and women with disabilities.

Companies are setting the right priorities, but they are not 
translating into manager action

Career advancement has long been a core expectation of managers. And now, more companies 
are also asking managers to foster a culture of inclusion and employee well-being, which is 
critically important to the health of organizations. When managers invest in all of these areas, 
employees are less burned out, happier in their roles, and less likely to think about leaving 
their organization.26 The problem is that despite increased trainings for managers on these 
priorities, they are by and large not translating into better manager performance.

A CLOSER LOOK

A lack of time and recognition may explain why managers aren't acting on company priorities

Companies are asking more of managers, and absent more time and resources, it may be hard for managers to deliver on 
these expanded expectations. In addition, many managers are only being evaluated and rewarded for progress on business 
goals, as opposed to people-management goals like career development and team morale. As a result, managers may be 
less focused on these areas.

Companies have increased inclusion eﬀorts, 
but employee behavior remains largely the same

In addition to setting inclusion as a top priority with managers, companies are doing more to activate 
employees as agents of change: for example, nearly all companies now oﬀer bias or allyship training.32
The problem is that increased training does not appear to be translating into increased awareness or action: 
employees are not markedly more likely to recognize bias against women or act as allies to women of color.

Companies have stepped up their eﬀorts to make the workplace more 
equitable and inclusive, but progress is uneven

Despite challenges activating managers and employees, it’s clear that companies’ eﬀorts to advance women and 
improve the culture of work are leading to positive changes. A majority of employees believe that aspects of the 
workplace have changed for the better in the last decade—most notably, women’s opportunities to advance and 
companies’ eﬀorts to foster inclusion. However, there are clear signs that more needs to be done. Employees 
universally agree that there has been less progress in how organizations handle microaggressions. And men 
are far more optimistic about how women’s opportunities have improved in the past decade.

A majority of employees see progress on inclusion eﬀorts and women’s opportunities, but not on addressing microaggressions

A CLOSER LOOK

Declining commitment to diversity is deeply concerning

We’re at a critical moment when companies should be building on their positive momentum. Given the level of work and resolve it will take to do this 
eﬀectively, companies’ declining commitments to gender and racial diversity are problematic. On top of this, managers’ and employees’ relatively 
low—and relatively stagnant—commitment to diversity points to the importance of company-wide education and engagement on these issues.

“

The biggest barrier is will. I don’t 
know that we have the will to make 
overarching changes to the way 
that we view the workplace because 
the status quo is working for a 
bunch of people. Unfortunately, 
not many of those people are 
women or people with traditionally 
marginalized identities.”

Black woman, manager, 2024

Part 1: A 10-year look at women’s representation

PART 3

A 10-YEAR LOOK AT WOMEN’S EXPERIENCES

Women’s experiences at 
work have not improved

Despite an increase in women’s representation and expanded company eﬀorts, the workplace has 
not gotten better for women. Women continue to worry it will be harder for them to advance, and 
their day-to-day interactions look largely like they did in 2015. In fact, this stands out as the area of 
least progress across the 10 years of this study.

Today, women are just as likely as in the past to think their gender will limit their opportunities to 
advance, and women of color are more likely to think their race has made it harder. The next 
generation of women leaders are even less optimistic: in addition to feeling more disadvantaged 
by their gender or race, younger women are most likely to experience ageism. 

Women’s concerns stem from what they’re up against. Women—and particularly women of color—
are not getting enough support from their managers. They are still far more likely than men to face 
bias that calls their abilities and leadership potential into question. And women of color, LGBTQ+ 
women, and women with disabilities stand out for experiencing more demeaning interactions at 
work. Moreover, sexual harassment is as prevalent in today’s workplace as it was ﬁve years ago. 

In the face of all this, women remain highly ambitious—and as ambitious as men. Now companies 
need to invest more deeply in changing the culture of work, so women get the respect, support, 
and advocacy they need to go as far as they can.

31  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES

Women today are no more optimistic than in the past about how their gender will impact their

Younger women are the most susceptible to ageism

Conventional wisdom suggests that ageism—or unfair treatment based on a person’s age—predominantly

also impacts older employees, but at fairly similar rates for women and men.

Performance bias prevents women from advancing, 
especially when they’re early in their careers.

Microaggressions that undermine women’s abilities are 
rooted in performance bias, or the unfair belief that men 
are naturally more competent and better leaders. As a 
result, research shows that we tend to judge women's 
performance more harshly, and while we promote men 
based on their perceived potential, women are promoted 
based on what they've already accomplished. This 
biased thinking is particularly harmful to women early 
in their careers, when shorter track records and fewer 
opportunities to demonstrate their skills make them 
more susceptible to snap judgments.63

Men and women are less likely to be interrupted or spoken over 
than they were ﬁve years ago—a sign that increased awareness 
around an issue can lead to cultural change. However, women 
remain twice as likely as men to experience this.

Many women experience bias because of both their gender and other 
aspects of their identity. This compounding discrimination is particularly 
harmful for LGBTQ+ women and women with disabilities, who are the 
most likely of any group to have their competence challenged at work.

IN THEIR WORDS: THE EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN WITH  DISABILITIES

“

I’ve seen people with speech disabilities get overlooked for 
leadership. They might be really good at their job, but there’s 
a feeling that they can’t present like a leader because of the 
way that they talk.”

White woman, senior manager, 2024  

“I’ve felt judged for working flexibly. Due to a medical 
condition, I have to take a break every so often and lie down, 
and it makes me anxious that people will wonder where I am. 
It doesn’t mean I’m less of an asset to the company.”

White woman, manager, 2023

“Disability is often left out of the picture when it comes to any 
type of workplace diversity and inclusion training. It’s put on 
the back burner or left out of the conversation.”

Black woman, entry level, 2023

“

I’m often the only person with disabilities in the 
room. People ignore me. I get overridden all the 
time. Then later, someone else will repeat my idea 
and it will get acted on. It makes me feel I’m not 
valued as a person in any way, and I don’t feel I 
can be my true self.”

Women continue to shoulder more housework

Women still do far more housework than men. Today, roughly 4 in 10 women with partners say they are responsible 
for most or all of the housework—the same as in 2016. In contrast, over the same period of time, far more men report 
they share housework equally with their partner. These diverging perceptions are concerning, as they point to a 
growing gap in how women and men see their contributions at home. On top of this, younger women report doing 
the same amount of housework as older women, and this also signals a lack of progress.

Microaggressions have a “macro” impact on 
women’s experiences

Microaggressions take a heavy toll: women who experience them are more likely 
to feel burned out and consider leaving their company, and less likely to view their 
workplace as equitable. By leaving microaggressions unchecked, companies miss 
out on everything women have to oﬀer and risk losing talented employees.

Sexual harassment is as prevalent today as it was ﬁve years ago

Sexual harassment remains common in the workplace, and women are still more likely than men to be on the receiving end of it. 
Roughly 4 in 10 women have experienced some form of sexual harassment during their careers, from hearing sexist jokes to having 
obscene or sexually explicit comments directed at them. Notably, younger women, who have much shorter tenures, are just as likely 
as older women to have experienced some form of sexual harassment over the course of their career—a sign that it is not becoming 
any less common. In addition, women are signiﬁcantly less conﬁdent than men in their company’s handling of sexual harassment 
claims, and senior-level men are the most conﬁdent: 8 in 10 think a claim would be fairly investigated and addressed.

A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO SOLUTIONS

The next phase of work will 
require a bigger playbook

Over the last decade, companies have invested more energy in women’s advancement, but the fragility of progress in 
the pipeline points to the need to do more. And despite companies’ eﬀorts to activate managers and employees, the 
culture of work appears to be stuck. If one thing is clear, it’s that deep, systemic change—which requires reshaping 
people’s mindsets and behaviors—is hard and doesn’t follow a linear path.

The next phase of change will require even more tenacity, creativity, and optimism—and that starts with rekindling 
the commitment to diversity and fairness that got us to this point. For senior leaders, it means continuing to champion 
this important work and challenging yourself and your organization to do better.

For most companies, this will require putting more of the right practices in place. Our best practices checklist—
which was built by looking at the uptake of key policies and programs and their link to better outcomes for women 
and women of color—can help you identify gaps in your current oﬀerings and opportunities to push further. 

In addition, it will be important to apply rigor to the quality and consistency of practices. Research shows there 
are four building blocks to getting this right: 1) making sure employees understand why a new practice is important; 
2) teaching employees the skills they need to do their part; 3) putting mechanisms in place to support the practice; 
and 4) ensuring leaders role model the right behaviors. Many organizations do some of these things when they’re 
introducing a new practice, but surprisingly few do all of them.

And ﬁnally, there are practical steps you can take to drive further progress in areas that we know are particularly 
important for advancing women and fostering inclusion:

● De-bias the hiring and promotions processes

●

Inspire and equip employees to curb bias and practice allyship

● Unlock the power of managers to inﬂuence careers and team culture

Our research-based tips and strategies oﬀer a road map for going deeper in these areas—and we hope inspiration 
for breaking new ground. 

“

Organizational change is a marathon, not a 
sprint, and making meaningful strides for 
women requires both hope and resilience. 
When leaders create a compelling vision 
of what’s possible, workplaces are better 
equipped to drive and sustain progress.”

Prof. Adam Grant, organizational psychologist and author of Think Again

THE FUNDAMENTALS
Conﬁrming the right 
fundamentals are in place

Company and HR leaders should evaluate their 
current eﬀorts to advance women and improve 
equity and inclusion against our checklist of 
recommended practices.73 

As a general rule, companies should have all 
Common Practices in place. There’s a reason 
they’re so widely adopted and prevalent in 
top-performing companies: they work.

We also recommend organizations integrate 
Emerging Practices into their playbook. While 
the relatively low adoption of these practices 
makes it harder to quantify their overall impact, 
subject- matter experts point to their eﬀectiveness.

3 BEST PRACTICES FOR DELIVERING YOUR EQUITY AND INCLUSION MESSAGE 

47  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: SOLUTIONS

BEYOND THE BASICS
Getting de-biasing hiring and 
performance reviews right

Most companies have taken steps to make hiring and 
performance reviews fairer. This is important progress, 
given these are two of the biggest levers companies can 
pull to advance women, and particularly women of color. 
However, the quality, depth, and consistency of these 
practices can make a huge diﬀerence in outcomes.

“

Bias erodes the link between what employees do 
and the ratings they receive. If companies don’t 
take active steps to strengthen this connection, 
such as standardizing how employees are rated, 
they’re opening the door to inequity.” 

Dr. Alison Wynn, senior research scholar, Stanford VMware Women's 
Leadership Innovation Lab

RESEARCH-BASED TIPS FOR MAKING HIRING AND PERFORMANCE REVIEWS FAIRER

Eﬀectively evaluating candidates

Minimizing and surfacing bias

1

Establish evaluation criteria up front 

1

Anonymize personal information

Evaluators should meet in advance to align on which criteria matter 
most and how to measure them. Aligning on metrics up front, before 
any candidates are under consideration, can help prevent bias from 
creeping into the process.74

2

Design evaluation tools to gather objective, measurable inputs

In designing evaluation tools, be mindful of the use of open-ended 
questions, such as “Describe this person’s strengths,” which can open 
the door to bias. Look for opportunities to add rigor to them—for example, 
by asking for speciﬁc examples of how an employee did or didn’t meet 
expectations and any measurable outcomes. Research shows these 
tactics can minimize biased assessments.75

3

Apply rigor to diverse slates for hiring

Companies should formally articulate their deﬁnition of a diverse slate, 
how this is measured, and at what stages in the process a diverse slate 
is required.76 Then, to authentically put this approach into practice, 
companies should hold hiring managers accountable for building slates 
of comparably experienced and qualiﬁed candidates.

Removing names from résumés and work samples can signiﬁcantly 
reduce bias in hiring—research shows that names that hint at a 
candidate's gender or race can trigger harmful stereotypes.77

2

Send bias reminders to all evaluators 

Biases are hard to spot and may not be top of mind for evaluators, 
so reminders can make a big impact.78 Refreshers should include 
common examples of how bias shows up in hiring and promotions. 
In addition, it’s always helpful to remind evaluators to stick to the 
established criteria for a role and avoid vague input.79

3

Appoint a bias monitor

Of all the mechanisms to surface bias, research shows that a bias 
monitor is one of the most eﬀective. This person’s role is to redirect 
conversations about candidates back to the job criteria and call out 
potential bias. Alternatively, it can be just as eﬀective to have the 
whole group agree to monitor one another.80 

PRO TIP: Instruct employees to watch for subjective comments, 
such as “She doesn’t seem like a leader” or “She’s not a good 
cultural ﬁt,” which tend to be rooted in personal preferences or 
unconscious bias.81

BEYOND THE BASICS
Activating employees to change the culture of work 

Changing employee behavior is hard. Despite existing eﬀorts, employees still struggle to identify workplace 
bias and are no more likely to practice allyship. Broad change requires changing employees’ hearts and 
minds, and giving them the wherewithal to show up diﬀerently in their day-to-day actions.

6 STRATEGIES FOR TELLING A MORE EXPANSIVE STORY

1

Give employees the “why” 

When employees see that change is urgently needed—not just 
broadly, but at their own organizations—they’re more likely to 
act.82 Companies can convey this by highlighting the 
downsides of inaction, such as lost talent or reduced 
innovation.83 They should also use internal data to help 
employees understand the reality of women’s experiences at 
their own ﬁrm—for example, by sharing women’s promotion 
rates or employee experience metrics pointing to areas for 
improvement.

2
2

Speak to what employees stand to gain personally

It’s important to share speciﬁc examples of how diversity and 
inclusion eﬀorts beneﬁt everyone—and make this a staple 
of regular company communications.84 For example, explain 
that everyone has a better chance of advancing when there 
are practices in place to make promotions fair.85 Or, point 
out how women’s advancement eﬀorts have led to cultural 
improvements that support all employees.

3

Link eﬀorts to advance women to your company’s 
core values

Connecting diversity eﬀorts to shared values is one of the 
most eﬀective ways to rally employees.86 If your company 
values innovation, share research ﬁndings that diverse teams 
are often more innovative. Or, if you are customer focused, 
talk about how having more women in leadership can help 
enhance products geared to women. 

“If we raise the water level, all boats 

rise and it’s good for everybody.”

Christy Pambianchi, executive vice president and 
chief people oﬃcer, Intel

HOW MASTERCARD TIES GENDER EFFORTS TO 
SHARED VALUES

At Mastercard, senior leaders made the case that 
internal eﬀorts to advance women can lead to 
new solutions and products—including eﬀorts to 
support women business owners. As Chief People 
Oﬃcer Michael Fraccaro explains, “We know when 
we invest in our people and global communities, 
everyone prospers. Our work to connect women 
entrepreneurs to the tools they need to grow their 
businesses is just one example.” 

4

Make an emotional connection with employees

Real-life storytelling is a powerful way to shift employees’ 
perspectives and inspire change. For example, stories from 
employees with disabilities who’ve struggled to participate in 
work activities can bring the importance of practicing inclusion 
to life, while stories from women who’ve thrived in ﬁelds 
dominated by men can underscore the importance of manager 
support. To avoid putting the onus on employees to share their 
experiences, companies should consider investing in guest 
speakers and storytellers.87

5

Be transparent about how challenging change can be

When companies openly acknowledge that large-scale change 
is hard, it creates more realistic expectations, which can help 
minimize the morale issues that lead to lost momentum.88 
Being realistic about challenges also underscores the level of 
commitment needed over the long term to achieve success, so 
that employees are better prepared for the hard work ahead.89 

6

Celebrate wins

Research shows that large-scale change is more likely to succeed 
when organizations celebrate small wins.90 Companies should 
look out for incremental steps that count as wins, such as selecting 
new allyship training based on employee input or making the 
switch to a more quantitative performance review process.91 
They should also encourage employees to celebrate one another’s 
accomplishments, which can be energizing and create a virtuous 
cycle of positive actions.92

“

Stories can make a huge impact on 
employees—hearing how it’s changed 
someone’s life to have an inclusive 
workplace, or a microaggression-free 
workplace, or a workplace where 
they feel supported to show up 
as a caregiver.”

Ruchika T. Malhotra, inclusion strategist and 
author of Inclusion on Purpose

HOW T-MOBILE FOSTERS EMPATHY

T-Mobile hosts “immersive experiences” to help 
employees gain deeper insights into experiences 
beyond their own. As Deeanne King, the company’s 
executive vice president and chief people oﬃcer, 
explains, “We took employees to the National 
Museum of African American History and Culture. 
It was emotional and helped both Black and 
non-Black employees see through a diﬀerent 
lens.” T-Mobile has also facilitated activities and 
events involving veterans, LGBTQ+ employees, 
Asian employees, and other groups and allies.

BEYOND THE BASICS
Delivering your inclusion message so it breaks through

Crafting the right message is essential, but it’s only part of the equation. Decades of research 
show that how companies deliver the message is equally critical for its success.

3 BEST PRACTICES FOR DELIVERING YOUR EQUITY AND INCLUSION MESSAGE 

1

Both leaders and managers should deliver the message

Backing from senior leaders is crucial to ensure meaningful change. In fact, HR leaders say that “communication 
and commitment from senior leaders” is the top driver of successful diversity eﬀorts.93 It’s equally important that 
managers play a role: when employees only hear from leadership, it can feel disempowering—as though the eﬀort 
is beyond their control. In contrast, hearing from managers allows employees more room to oﬀer input and be 
heard.94 Research shows that employees value receiving important updates from their own manager, who they 
know and trust.95 

2

Communicate frequently and through a variety of channels

When employees receive regular updates about a change, they’re more likely to feel positively about it.96 
In fact, research suggests that the more information workers receive about major changes, the better they feel. 
And when companies use a variety of form factors—from regular emails to a series of town halls with leaders—
it helps messages break through and resonate with more employees.97 

3

Create a feedback loop with employees

Decades of research show that employees are more willing to accept and participate in change when they’ve 
had a chance to inﬂuence what’s happening.98 Before and after new programs and policies are rolled out, 
organizations should oﬀer varied opportunities for employees to share—including surveys, roundtable discussions, 
and an open-door policy with HR. And crucially, employees need to see that their feedback leads to real action.

A CLOSER LOOK

How to evaluate the quality of your employee training 

A majority of companies now oﬀer bias and allyship trainings—in fact, 9 in 10 now oﬀer one or both 
of them. However, not all trainings are eﬀective. In fact, research shows that if they don’t follow 
research-backed methods to engage employees, they can even be counterproductive.99

The Markers of Eﬀective Bias and Allyship Trainings

Eﬀective trainings …

● Consist mostly of live sessions—in-person or online— 

and are part of a larger program that includes ongoing 
touchpoints and refreshers. Research shows that 
repeated, active engagement with a topic leads to 
greater learning.100

AVOID: Trainings that are videos, 
self-guided trainings, or short, one-oﬀ 
sessions, as these tend to have little 
impact—or even no impact at all.105

● Provide authentic ways for employees to interact and 
brainstorm how to take action: when employees are 
involved in solving the problem, they tend to be more 
committed to the solution.101

AVOID: Trainings that do not encourage 
employee participation—or where 
participation is an afterthought, like a quiz 
or very short conversation at the end.

● Include engaging facts, data, and storytelling to 
raise employee awareness about the biases and 
inequalities women still face.102

● Focus on concrete steps employees can take. 

When trainings emphasize what employees can 
say or do, employees are more likely to feel empowered 
to act.103

● Treat participants like they’re well intentioned and 

want to make a diﬀerence so they don’t feel accused 
or blamed. When employees feel defensive, they are 
less likely to learn and grow.104

AVOID: Trainings that spend a majority of 
time teaching employees about the biases 
they themselves hold.

A closer look: How to more fully engage men

Men have a vital role to play in advancing women and fostering inclusion. Because they make 

up over half the workforce, men’s active participation is essential. And because they hold a 

majority of leadership roles, men have a critical part to play in role-modeling the behavior 

changes needed for cultural transformation.

3 STRATEGIES FOR ENGAGING MEN

1

Be explicit that women's advancement also beneﬁts men

Given that many diversity eﬀorts focus on how women beneﬁt, it’s not surprising men may not 

always see what they stand to gain. To combat this, companies should ﬁnd opportunities to 

convey how these eﬀorts link to issues that matter to men. For example, work-life conﬂict has 

traditionally been discussed as a women's issue, when it’s also an issue that also deeply aﬀects 

men. When companies point to the beneﬁts for men of programs supporting work-life balance, 

it signals that men’s wellbeing is being prioritized along with women’s.[EN] In addition, 

companies should look for ways to put this sentiment into action–for example, by oﬀering 

equal parental leave to men and normalizing its use.

2

Make sure senior-level men are in the know and on board

Activating senior-level men is mission critical, as they are uniquely positioned to advance 

gender equality. Senior-level men stand out as notably optimistic about the state of women, so 

it’s vital they grasp the data showing that progress remains slow and incomplete. Moreover, it 

helps when senior-level men understand the pivotal role they play in advancing women. On top 

of the strong link between senior-leader support and the success of organizational change, 

research shows that early career men are more likely to act on inclusion if they see and hear 

senior-level men doing the same.  

3

Oﬀer allyship groups

Companies should consider sponsoring allyship groups in the same way they sponsor 

ERGs.[EN] These groups provide camaraderie and a structured way for men and other 

allies to participate. Moreover, employer-sponsored groups make it clear that allyship is 

aligned with company priorities – and this explicitness can help motivate men.

“Research shows that even when parental leave is 

available, men are less likely to take it. So we need 

to normalize men being caregivers. Senior-level 

men can play a role by sharing things like, ‘I'm 

taking the afternoon to see my grandchild's 

baseball game’ or ‘I’m taking time to help my 

elderly mom.’”

– Ruchika T. Malhotra, inclusion strategist and author of 

Inclusion on Purpose

“Male allyship groups are on the rise. Men can look 

at the whole constellation of ERGs and think, ‘well, 

where does the average white guy ﬁt into that?’ 

Allyship groups are a way to include men in a way 

that feels comfortable.”

– David Smith, author of Good Guys

A CLOSER LOOK

How to more fully engage men

Men have a vital role to play in advancing women and 
fostering inclusion. Not only do they make up at least half 
the workforce, men also hold a majority of leadership 
roles. This makes their active participation and support 
essential for driving real progress.

Men in leadership can ﬁll the sponsorship gap

Senior-level men are uniquely positioned to be 
eﬀective sponsors—but they need to be mobilized. 
This really matters: sponsorship can accelerate 
careers, yet less than 1 in 4 companies has a formal 
program, leaving most women reliant on informal 
sponsorship.106 And this often results in women 
missing out due to “aﬃnity bias,” which leads 
senior-level men to sponsor others like themselves. 
To address this, companies should educate men 
that sponsors and sponsees don’t need to share 
the same identity, and guide them on how to support 
women eﬀectively, for example, by learning about 
the unique challenges women face at work.107

BEYOND THE BASICS

Unlocking the power of managers 

Managers hold a unique and powerful position within their 
organizations, given their impact on employee experience. 
When managers fail to take action, research shows it’s often 
for three reasons that are outside their control: 

● Their priorities and performance metrics are misaligned

● They lack the time and resources to be successful

● Leadership has not included them in the conversation 

Armed with this knowledge, there are steps companies can 
take to unlock the full potential of managers.111

3 RESEARCH-BASED TIPS FOR ACTIVATING MANAGERS

1
1

Align managers’ priorities and rewards

Lack of clarity around what’s expected of them is a key source of stress for managers. 
To alleviate this, companies should make sure priorities, trainings, and performance 
expectations are well aligned.112 For instance, if supporting employee advancement is 
a key focus, that should be clearly communicated and emphasized in both training 
programs and performance reviews. 

2
2

Ensure managers have the time and resources they need

Given the broad range of goals they’re expected to meet, managers are often spread too 
thin—42 percent of managers often or always feel burned out, compared to 33 percent of 
non-managers.113 To address this, companies should look for opportunities to reduce 
managers’ individual workloads so they have more time to support their teams. It can also 
help to put tools in place to make it easier for managers to be eﬀective, such as standardized 
questions to gauge their team members’ well-being and sample scripts for important career 
conversations. These steps pay oﬀ: when managers spend more time developing their teams, 
results improve. 

3

Invite managers into a dialogue

A large body of research shows that when managers have meaningful input into their 
mandate—and how to accomplish it—organizational change is far more likely to 
succeed.114 To do this eﬀectively, companies should consistently solicit managers’ 
feedback on new policies and practices and how to improve them. This helps managers 
feel seen and heard, and provides leadership with insights into on-the-ground challenges.

HOW PFIZER REDEFINED MANAGER EVALUATIONS

Pﬁzer has changed how managers are evaluated to 
reward how they lead. In addition to rating their 
business outcomes, performance ratings now focus 
on how managers achieve those results by measuring 
their positive impact on their teams. For example, 
Pﬁzer now assesses how well managers implement 
company values, such as excellence and equity, 
based on direct feedback from their teams.

“

What middle managers do is actually much more 
complex than what either executives or frontline 
workers do: They manage both up and down, 
and serve as translators in both directions.”

Methodology

DATA SOURCES 

This report is primarily focused on data from the 2024 Women in the Workplace study and also draws extensively from published and 
unpublished data from the 2015-2023 Women in the Workplace reports. Historical data trends were analyzed across Pipeline data, 
Employee Experience surveys, and HR Program and Policies, and data points were included based on substantiated 2024 ﬁndings.

RESEARCH PARTICIPATION FOR 2024 STUDY

This report is based on research from 281 companies across the United States and Canada, building on similar research conducted 
annually by McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org since 2015, as well as research from McKinsey & Company in 2012.

Participating companies from the private, public, and social sectors submitted talent pipeline and/or policies and programs data. 
In addition, more than 15,000 employees from 27 companies were surveyed on their workplace experiences and we interviewed 
27 women and non-binary individuals, including people of diﬀerent races and ethnicities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with 
disabilities at all levels in their organizations working remotely, hybrid, or on-site.

We grouped companies by industry to create benchmarks that provide peer comparisons. The number of companies from each 
industry is as follows:

Companies opted into the study in response to invitations from McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org or by indicating interest through our public 
website. Participation in the Employee Experience Survey was encouraged, but optional. All talent pipeline data collection occurred between 
March and May 2024. Talent pipeline data reﬂect representation of women and men as of December 31, 2023, as well as personnel changes 
(e.g., due to promotion, hiring, and attrition) during 2023. Therefore, all talent pipeline data do not represent any changes that occurred during 
2024. Human resource leaders and professionals provided information on policies, programs, and priorities on behalf of their company between 
March and May 2024. Additionally, employees were surveyed on their workplace experiences between March and May 2024. These data sets 
represent point-in-time snapshots and reﬂect companies’ responses and employees’ experiences at the time that the survey was taken.

PIPELINE DATA AND ANALYTICS

Overall Metrics

All pipeline metrics (e.g., representation, promotion rates, hiring shares, attrition rates) were calculated for each participating company. Company 
results were then averaged for each industry and each industry’s data were weighted by the composition of the Fortune 500 in 2023. This enabled

Deﬁnition of Job Levels

Companies categorized their employees into six levels based on the following standard deﬁnitions, considering reporting structure and salaries. 
The levels and deﬁnitions provided were:

●

●
●

●

L1—Executives: CEO and direct reports to the CEO, responsible for company operations and proﬁtability (board members are not included 
in our primary analyses unless they are also employees)
L2—Senior vice presidents and other similar roles: senior leaders of the organization with signiﬁcant business unit or functional oversight
L3—Vice presidents and other similar roles: leaders within the organization, responsible for activities/initiatives within a subunit of a 
business unit or function, or who report directly to senior vice presidents
L4—Senior managers: seasoned managers and contributors, with responsibility for multiple teams and discrete functions or operating units

L5—Managers: junior managers and contributors, responsible for small teams and/or functional units or operations
L6—Entry level: employees responsible for carrying out discrete tasks and participating on teams, typically in an oﬃce or corporate 
setting
L7—Frontline: Field employees like cashiers or customer service representatives, responsible for carrying out customer-facing jobs, 
typically in a retail or branch location

Thresholds determined based on workforce representation trends in U.S. Census (~18-20% population of women of color), current 
representation of women at entry levels in Talent Pipeline (20% for women of color; 28% for white women), and assumption that pipeline 
and growing population of diverse women will attribute to greater representation of women at senior levels in future years. Only women 
and men were included in projection analyses due to the extremely small sample of employees outside the gender binary. Parity 
thresholds were set per demographic at:

TALENT PIPELINE

Metrics and Analytics

Talent pipeline data included the representation of men and women (overall, in line versus staﬀ roles, by race/ethnicity, and optionally for 
functional roles like marketing, sales, and engineering). In addition, companies reported the number of men and women who were hired, 
promoted, and who left the company (overall, by race/ethnicity, and optionally for functional roles like marketing, sales, and engineering 
roles, as well as optionally for voluntarily versus involuntarily leaving). Promotion and attrition rates were calculated for women and men, 
overall and by race/ethnicity, at each level. Promotion rates were calculated by dividing the number of promotions of that gender into a level 
by the number of employees of that gender in the level below at the start of the year. Attrition rates were calculated by dividing the number 
of each gender who left the company at a given level by the number of employees of that gender in that level at the start of the year. 
Submitted data were checked for consistency and inconsistent data were excluded as needed.

YEARS TO PARITY ESTIMATE AND ANALYTICS

General Context

Years to parity estimates were modeled by industry, including all companies that participated between 2022 – 2024, for roles ranging from 
C-Suite to SVP (L1-L2). The analysis was done independently for each level L1-L2. The model uses initial representation and projects 
representation changes over time for a given demographic (i.e., men, women overall, women of color, and white women). Parity thresholds 
were set for each respective group and an estimate was determined based on when a group meets their respective threshold. Additional 
details on projection methodology and assumptions detailed below:

Projected Representation Change

Projected representation changes were analyzed across men, women overall, women of color, and white women for roles at the C-suite 
and SVP (L1 and L2) levels. Levels were grouped to ensure suﬃcient sample size and incorporate nuance seen at the senior leadership 
levels across industries. Representation change was deﬁned as the net change as a result of hiring, promotions, and attrition within a given 
year, where projected values were determined by applying Geometric Brownian Motion to capture the stochastic nature of population 
change. The model incorporated into a Monte Carlo Simulation to further consider the range of possibilities when estimating the years to 
parity for each group and ensure resulting estimates account for variability and uncertainty year-over-year.

Assumptions and Further Considerations

●

Parity threshold selection: Parity thresholds were set respectively for each grouping after considering current 2024 representation 
of the workforce and estimated growth ﬁgures. Thresholds must be reached in the model for a group to be considered at parity. 

○
○

Women of color: 25% of total population
White women: 25% of total population

●

Additional modeling choices: Additional factors taken into consideration when choosing model parameters and handling edge cases:

○

○

○

○

Monte Carlo iterations: Simulation ran 1,000 iterations for each industry to evaluate a wide range of possible estimates and 
averaged to determine years to parity estimates for a given industry. Iterations were chosen to create a large sample of possible 
estimate and ensure accurate estimate.

Projection time bounds: The model measures projected representation change over 100 years to provide a runway to reach 
convergence into an estimate. Time bound chosen after running sensitivity tests and determining minimal upside in expanding 
the limits beyond 100 years.

Estimates not reached within the model: In the rare event that an estimate is not reached over 100 years across the 1,000 
iterations, an assumed value of 100 years is used for that industry/level combination. Only 2 out of 198 industry/level combinations 
were not able to reach an estimated time to parity given the model parameters above and used the assumed value of 100 years.

Industry weighting when reaching an aggregate estimate: When computing aggregate estimates for each group and level, the 
industries are averaged using the F500 weights described above.

EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE SURVEY AND ANALYTICS

Survey Participation 

More than 15,000 employees from 27 organizations elected to participate in the Employee Experience Survey. The survey questions covered 
multiple themes (e.g., overall satisfaction, ﬂexibility and remote/hybrid workplaces, advancement, employee well-being, equity, mentorship, and 
sponsorship) as well as demographic questions (e.g., gender, gender of primary manager, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, role, 
family status, household characteristics, and responsibilities).

Statistical Reporting of Survey Data

Survey results were reported as an unweighted polled average of responses across companies. Many of the questions oﬀered a ﬁve-point labeled 
response scale (e.g., “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”). Unless otherwise speciﬁed, analyses aggregated the top two and bottom two boxes 
of the response scale (e.g., combining “Somewhat agree” and “Strongly agree”). Where we highlight diﬀerences between genders or other groups, 
we highlight only those diﬀerences that are substantial and reliable. To that end, all diﬀerences noted in this report are statistically signiﬁcant to a 
95 percent conﬁdence level and/or reﬂect a diﬀerence of at least ﬁve percentage points between two groups unless otherwise indicated. In 
addition to establishing a minimum ﬁve percentage point diﬀerence when comparing data from diﬀerent years, we also examined the trajectory 
and variability of data when there were more than two years of data available. We acknowledge that diﬀerences in participating companies each 
year mean that year-to-year comparisons may be due to sample characteristics or random variation. Wherever possible, data was triangulated from 
multiple sources to conﬁrm trends and strengthen our ﬁndings.

Methodology

HR PROGRAMS AND POLICIES

Human resource professionals from 291 organizations provided information on gender diversity policies and programs on behalf of their 
organization. Not all participating companies also participated in the Talent Pipeline. We report the percentage of organizations that have 
a program, policy, priority, or position out of the total number of companies that submitted HR program/policy data.

HR AND DEI BEST PRACTICES

DEI best practices are based on a top performer analysis conducted with pipeline data and HR survey data. This is supplemented by 
external research, past Women in the Workplace studies, and responses from subject-matter experts about what has been most eﬀective 
in improving representation and advancement of women. We used talent pipeline data from 271 companies that participated in both the 
Talent Pipeline and HR Surveys in 2024 to identify organizations that outperform on representation of women and women of color metrics. 
We compared their total women and women of color representation for L2 to L6 to their industry’s average for these values. Roles in L1 
were intentionally excluded from the analysis, given the variability in representation across companies and nuance noted at the C-suite 
level. We then ranked the companies by the extent to which they outperformed this year’s industry benchmarks for total women and women 
of color representation from L2 to L6 in the pipeline to identify the top quartile of companies. The key HR practices and policies that drive 
progress were based on the top-performer analysis and were deﬁned as practices where there was a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the 
percentage of top-performing organizations (n = 68) and non-top-performing organizations (n = 208) that have adopted that practice. 
In cases where recommendations included multiple individual practices (e.g., sponsorship and/or mentorship programs for women and 
women of color), the recommendation was classiﬁed as a signiﬁcant practice if there was at least one statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence 
between top performers and all other companies in the analyses for any of the listed practices. To further inform solutions, we conducted 
additional deep-dive analyses by themes (e.g., beneﬁts and support, tracking, and metrics) for top-performing organizations, including 
assessing what practices are adopted signiﬁcantly more by top-performing companies than non-top-performing organizations.

QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS

We conducted individual interviews with 27 women and nonbinary employees across multiple industries. Interviewees were volunteers 
selected to reﬂect a range of levels, departments, and demographic groups. Our interviews focused on workplace experiences to gain a 
deeper understanding of the quantitative ﬁndings from the employee survey. Individual names, company names, and any other identifying 
information were kept strictly conﬁdential, and individuals are anonymized in this report. Within the quotes, some identifying details may 
have been altered and/or withheld to protect the speaker’s anonymity. Quotes have been edited for clarity.

HR EXECUTIVE INTERVIEWS

We conducted individual interviews with nine HR executives [R4] across multiple industries. Interviewees were selected to reﬂect 
top-performing organizations across a range of industries. Our interviews focused on workplace themes (e.g., increasing representation of 
women in senior leadership, increasing company commitment to gender and racial diversity, importance of ﬂexibility to all and especially 
women) to gain a deeper understanding of the quantitative ﬁndings from the HR survey and potential recommendations for other 
organizations. Individual names and company names were provided upon approval of the interviewed HR executive.
