McKinsey Global Institute

The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact base 
to aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s 
companies and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, 
and functional knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are solely 
the responsibility of MGI directors and partners.

Our research is currently grouped into five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity: Creating and harnessing the world’s assets  

most productively

 — Resources of the world: Building, powering, and feeding the world sustainably

 — Human potential: Maximizing and achieving the potential of human talent

 — Global connections: Exploring how flows of goods, services, people, capital, and  

ideas shape economies

 — Technologies and markets of the future: Discussing the next big arenas of value  

and competition

We aim for independent and fact-based research. None of our work is commissioned or funded 
by any business, government, or other institution; we share our results publicly free of charge; 
and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While we engage multiple distinguished 
external advisers to contribute to our work, the analyses presented in our publications are MGI’s 
alone, and any errors are our own.

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityAt a glance

 — When firms become more productive, so do economies. Increasing the value each worker 
creates also promotes rising wages for workers and profits for firms. These facts are well 
known to economists. Our other findings are not. 

 — A small number of firms contribute the lion’s share of productivity growth. Fewer than 
100 productivity “Standouts” account for two-thirds of growth in our sample of 8,300 large 
firms in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Many others also play a role: 
the majority of firms contribute positively.

 — Productivity grows in powerful bursts as firms find new ways to create and scale new 

value. Think Apple expanding into services, easyJet shaping the discount airline trend, and 
Zalando pioneering apparel e-commerce. This is not the efficiency transformation nor the 
gradual diffusion described by conventional wisdom. 

 — In the United States, the most productive firms expanded and unproductive firms 

restructured or exited. This contributed half of US sample productivity growth while sticky 
underperformers dragged down growth in Germany and the United Kingdom. 

 — This fresh view of productivity growth calls for a new playbook. It suggests focus on the 
power of the few more than the broad swath, on value creation more than efficiency, and on 
reallocation of resources to leading businesses.

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityExecutive summary

The world needs robust productivity growth more than ever to address pressing global issues: 
inflated balance sheets, financing the transition to net zero, bridging empowerment gaps, and 
funding a demographic transition with more retirees and fewer workers.1 And a fundamental unit 
of productivity growth is firms. If firms do not increase their productivity, economies don’t, either. 

Firms themselves benefit from productivity growth, or growth in value added per worker. In 
view of long-term demographic shifts and the tight labor markets of today, labor productivity 
is a strategic imperative.2 And productivity growth is the only way for businesses to serve all 
their stakeholders, delivering rising wages for their workers, increased customer surplus, and 
profit. Customers and employees are typically the biggest and most immediate beneficiaries of 
productivity growth. Productivity growth is a win-win for all. 

This research finds that a relatively small number of firms making bold strategic moves generated 
the majority of productivity growth in the period we studied, in powerful bursts rather than in a 
smooth trickle of gradual change, and through strategic moves, top-line growth, and portfolio 
shifts more than efficiency gains. This was a more concentrated, dynamic, and sporadic pattern 
than existing literature tends to highlight, with progress on productivity being defined by a few 
firms moving a mile rather than many firms moving an inch. Single firms can move the productivity 
needle for entire economies—the “power of one.”

This latest offering in decades of McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) research on productivity carves 
out new ground from typical treatments of the topic. Those have focused on broad economic 
factors, such as labor-market dynamics, technological advances, capital investments, and 
fiscal and monetary policy, rather than firm-level features. Or they have focused on productivity 
dispersion and diffusion patterns across millions of often-anonymous firms. This research zooms 
in on those firms that are most relevant for driving growth and enriches quantitative analysis 
with sector- and firm-specific case studies in line with MGI’s tradition of analyzing the “micro-to-
macro” roots of productivity. In the 1990s, for instance, MGI coined the term “the Walmart effect” 
to show the disproportionate impact of the US retailer’s growth not only on its own sector but on 
the entire US economy.3 This work also builds on MGI’s long-standing tradition of understanding 
how companies and their contributions advance global economic and social progress.4 

We apply the economic definition of labor productivity as real gross value added (GVA) per 
worker, which is very different from profitability or efficiency and includes the impact of 
employees moving across firms. Our methodology comes with strengths and weaknesses (see 
sidebar “A new firm-by-firm lens on productivity growth”). First, we look at 8,300 large firms 
covering two-thirds of GVA in four sectors—retail, automotive and aerospace, travel and logistics, 
and computers and electronics—in three countries: Germany, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States.5 These are not complete samples of each country’s economy and also include 
multinationals. Second, we look at 2011–19, a period that may miss more recent market trends 
but that helps us identify productivity patterns that may hold over time. We have, if you like, 
constructed a “lab economy” for this research in a bid to discern what drives productivity and 
economic growth. Our findings prove robust under a gamut of tests.

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivitySIDEBAR
A new firm-by-firm lens on 
productivity growth

It is important to appreciate the decisions 
made regarding scope and approach for 
this report when viewing the results. They 
include the following:

Analyzing productivity as firm-level real 
GVA per worker rather than profitability 
or efficiency. In line with economic 
convention, this research divides GVA 
by the number of employees to compute 
productivity and adjusts for changes in 
input and output quality and prices at 
the sector level. GVA is revenue minus 
external cost, or labor compensation 
plus earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).1 
We apply so-called double-sided 
deflators to adjust for changes in output 
and input prices at the sector level to 
compute real value added.2 This definition 
of productivity is different from the one 
commonly used by business executives 
as shorthand for efficiency or profitability. 
In fact, growing real value per employee 

more often comes from improving 
customer value than from efficiency, and 
it can also reflect changes in business 
portfolio, value chains, or capital intensity. 
Moreover, since total wages are often 
twice as large as profits, they weigh more 
heavily in this formulation, too.

Including employment reallocation to 
more productive firms. This research 
includes employment weighting of 
productivity advances from individual 
firms as well as employment reallocation 
effects as the most productive firms gain 
employment share while less productive 
ones shrink or exit.3 

Looking at four sectors in three 
countries. We look at large firms in 
Germany, the United Kingdom, and 
the United States operating in four 
sectors—retail, automotive and aerospace, 
travel and logistics, and computers 
and electronics—and, within them, 
12 subsectors.

Looking through a window of 8,300 
large firms into the economy. We look 
at a sample of about 8,300 large firms 

(all with more than 50 employees, and 
most with more than 500) that cover the 
two-thirds of value added generated by 
large firms in our focus sectors. We do not 
include micro-, small, and medium-size 
enterprises (MSMEs) or startups, which 
account for less than 30 percent of the 
productivity growth in the four sectors 
in the three countries in our scope.4 We 
include the international operations of 
these firms with the aim of providing an 
accurate analysis of this lab economy 
rather than twisting ourselves into knots 
reconciling data with national statistics. 
Nonetheless, productivity growth in our 
sample is reasonably in sync with those. 

Looking at 2011–19 to find patterns 
that may hold over time. This is a 
reasonably stable period—albeit one with 
low productivity growth—between the 
global financial crisis and the COVID-19 
pandemic. The patterns observed in this 
period may hold outside of it, although the 
cast of characters will change. However, 
given limited data availability and quality, 
we do not focus in any detailed way on 
understanding firms outside this period.5 

1    For firm-level value added, we use the Orbis database from 2025 Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and/or its affiliates and licensors, making adjustments where necessary. 

For US firms whose disclosure requirements are lower, we estimate employee costs by taking sector-level average wages. We make manual adjustments using firm 
financial statements for the most relevant firms. Gross value added (GVA) is adjusted to constant 2019 values in local currency with EU KLEMS two-sided deflators that 
adjust for changes in input and output prices at the country and sector levels but not at the firm level. 

2   GVA is adjusted to constant 2019 values in local currency with EU KLEMS two-sided deflators that adjust for changes in input and output prices at the country and sector 
levels but not at the firm level. Double-sided deflators account for both quality-adjusted price changes that firms in a particular subsector make vis-à-vis their customers 
and those they experience from their suppliers.

3   For more on productivity growth through reallocation, see, for instance, Rasmus Lentz and Dale T. Mortensen, “Productivity growth and worker reallocation,” International 
Economic Review, volume 46, number 3, 2005. Also see J. David Brown and John S. Earle, Understanding the contributions of reallocation to productivity growth: Lessons 
from a comparative firm-level analysis, IZA Institute of Labor Economics discussion paper number 3683, September 2008; and Lucia Foster, Cheryl Grim, and John 
Haltiwanger, “Reallocation in the Great Recession: Cleansing or not?” Journal of Labor Economics, volume 34, number S1, part 2, January 2016.

4   National statistics authorities define MSMEs as firms with fewer than 500 employees in the United States and fewer than 250 employees in Germany and the 

United Kingdom.

5   In 2011, there were challenges to certain subsectors, but our tests show that inclusion of this time frame does not skew our core findings. However, the aggregate 

productivity growth rate during this period was lower than in other significant historical eras, suggesting further research on periods of rapid growth could yield additional 
insights on productivity drivers. Potential limitations introduced by this period include insufficient time for transformative technological change and for entering firms to 
achieve mature productivity levels; the significant growth of Big Tech firms in these years; a starting year that posed challenges to certain subsectors; and the fact that the 
period chosen began shortly after the global financial crisis. Firms that performed well on productivity during this period may have experienced different outcomes later, 
and vice versa.

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityA few firms shape the lion’s share of an economy’s productivity growth 
The prevailing view is that productivity growth emerges gradually through the incremental 
improvements of many firms, trickling down as best practices diffuse from leaders to the rest.6 
In our lab economy, a very limited number of firms drove the lion’s share of productivity growth in 
powerful bursts.

Approaching this topic from a distinct analytical angle led us to develop a specific terminology for 
certain firms in our sample. To help readers navigate what follows, we begin with a brief overview 
of these definitions (see sidebar “Glossary of firm descriptions”).

Productivity advances one firm at a time
Fewer than 100 firms in our sample of 8,300—a group that we have dubbed Standouts—
accounted for about two-thirds of the positive productivity gains in each of the three country 
samples we analyzed. Standouts are defined as firms that added at least one basis point to their 
national sample’s productivity growth. 

To give a sense of how important a single firm can be, just another dozen or so of the largest 
Standouts could have doubled productivity growth in their entire country. 

The number of firms that were responsible for the largest drags (negative contributions of at 
least one basis point) on productivity growth—we call them Stragglers—was even smaller. Only 
55 Stragglers accounted for 50 to 65 percent of the firm-level productivity drag in the three 
country samples (Exhibit 1). 

In our lab economy, a very limited 
number of firms drove the lion’s share of 
productivity growth in powerful bursts. 

employment share in their sector, 
that contributed mainly by increasing 
productivity rapidly. 

 — Scalers. Firms contributing mostly 

by increasing employment share 
throughout the period from a position 
of above-average productivity, often 
in the top quintile of employment-
weighted productivity levels. 

Restructurers. Firms contributing by 
lowering their employee share throughout 
the period (or exiting) while having below-
average productivity. 

Stragglers. Productivity Stragglers are 
firms that made negative contributions of 
at least one basis point to the productivity 
growth of their respective national samples 
in 2011–19. 

Frontier firms. The most productive 
companies in each sector, specifically 
those in the top 20 percent (top quintile) by 
productivity, weighted by employment, in 
both 2011 and 2019. Note that a Standout 
firm is not necessarily a frontier firm. In fact, 
two-thirds of Standouts in our sample were 
not in this top quintile.

Glossary of firm descriptions 

Standouts. Productivity Standouts are 
firms that added at least one basis point 
to their national sample’s productivity 
growth in 2011–19. Standouts fall into 
four categories, depending on how they 
have impact:

 — Improvers. Large firms—in the 

top 10 percent by the number of 
employeeas—that contributed mostly 
by increasing their productivity levels.

 — Disruptors. Smaller firms, typically 
with less than 1 percent of the

In the United States, for instance, 44 Standouts—5 percent of sample firms, accounting for 
23 percent of employment share—generated 78 percent of positive productivity growth. And 
14 Stragglers—2 percent of sample firms, accounting for 10 percent of employment—were 
responsible for 57 percent of negative growth (Exhibit 2). US Standouts included household 
names like Apple, Amazon, The Home Depot, and United Airlines.

Standouts shape sector dynamics, and vice versa 
The same patterns appear when we look at subsectors. The ratio of Standouts (and their 
contribution) to Stragglers (and their drag) was the clearest factor in driving fast productivity 
growth. In almost all subsectors experiencing rapid productivity growth (defined as 2 percent per 
year or more), Standouts drove the bulk of that growth, and there was less drag from Stragglers 
(Exhibit 3). 

The relationship between Standouts and sector growth is, of course, a symbiotic one. Standouts 
drive the growth of sectors, but some sectors also have the market dynamics, technology, 
regulation, and competitive setting that provide fertile ground for Standouts. There were more 
Standouts in sectors where firms could create new customer value and scale new business 
models than in sectors that were mostly about efficiency. For instance, the US computer and 
electronics sector came with many scalers and disruptors. Often when demand is faltering, other 
sectors are relative deserts, tending to produce more Stragglers or firms that restructure.7

Note: UK logistics is an edge case of Standout that contributes positively to sector but negatively to subsector, which is possible since Standouts are identified 
by sector-based contribution calculations. In this case, the firm gains employment share relative to sector sample but loses share relative to subsector sample, 
which turns its employment effect negative. See technical appendix for more detail on cases like this.

About 10 percent of firms accounted for 90 percent of productivity growth in the period studied. 
Looking at all firms, about 50 percent increased productivity faster than the sector average. 
Indeed, 20 percent of all firms increased productivity 1.5 times faster than the sector average 
while also increasing their employment share. 

The millions of MSMEs outside our sample collectively contributed up to 30 percent of 
productivity growth in the four sectors in the national statistics.8 Indeed, a handful of them may 
emerge as the Standouts of tomorrow.9

Standouts are sufficiently large, and make meaningful enough advances in productivity  
or scale, to shape national growth
Standouts tend to have sufficient size and either rapid productivity gains or sizable increases in 
employment share from an above-average position, which makes them able to drive economy-
wide growth. However, it is notable that, in general, Standouts are neither the most productive 
firms nor the firms that are growing productivity the fastest.10 In both cases, firms tend to be 
smaller and more niche and do not contribute an oversize amount to sector-level growth. These 
firms are also hard to replicate. In retail, for instance, firms with the top productivity levels are 
online game distribution platforms and distributors of manufacturers’ captive brands.11

Let us now look at the four types of Standouts, which we describe here ranked by size of 
contribution. Improvers—large firms that mainly contribute by advancing their productivity 
levels—made the largest contribution to productivity growth. Disruptors, or small firms that 
grew productivity and share very rapidly, actually made the smallest contribution. Scalers, which 
were already far above the sector’s average productivity and grew their share of employment, 
and therefore drove productivity growth mostly via employment reallocation, made the second-
largest contribution.12 Restructurers are less productive firms that made a positive contribution 
by losing market share and employment to more productive firms or exited altogether. 

Being large helps, but size alone is not sufficient to be a Standout. Large firms did not make 
an outsize contribution for their employment share. For example, in the United States, the top 
10 percent of firms by size that made positive contributions had 54 percent of the employment 
share but accounted for only 68 percent of positive productivity growth. Meanwhile, US 
Standouts had a 23 percent share of employment but accounted for 78 percent of positive 
growth. In fact, large firms are as likely to be Stragglers as Standouts, which explains this pattern. 

Including MSMEs would not have changed the disproportionate impact or identity of Standouts 
in our sample, partly because each individual MSME is too small. In the national statistics for 
the sectors in our scope, MSMEs collectively accounted for less than one-third of productivity 
growth. In short, in our sample, a handful of Standouts out of a million firms would account 
for more than half of productivity growth. This is a much more extreme concentration than 
commonly appreciated.

Some Standouts remain Standouts over long periods, but many change over time. With a  
limited sample, we find that about two-thirds of Standouts in 2011–19 remained Standouts in 
2019–23.13 The other one-third fell back, while new firms emerged as Standouts—including 
former Stragglers turning around.14 So, at any point in time, a few firms disproportionately matter, 
but these firms evolve. The story of productivity is highly dynamic. 

Standouts trigger productivity bursts with top-line growth and business 
shifts more than efficiency 
Standouts share few common characteristics. They come from all sectors and all parts of the 
productivity curve, have vastly different starting points on common business metrics and past 
performance, and contribute to productivity growth in different ways. What they have in common 
is “doing things differently” more than “doing things more efficiently.”15

10

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityWe conducted detailed case studies of all the Standouts in our sample sectors (retail, automotive 
and aerospace, travel and logistics, and computers and electronics). What emerges from these 
case studies is that Standouts used a combination of five types of moves, often in combination. 
Four of these relate to scaling productive businesses or finding new ways to create value. Only 
one is primarily about efficiency and cost.16 To help illustrate these strategies and how they are 
used, we offer the following examples: 

1.  Scaling more productive business models or technologies. Examples include Apple shaping 

the mobile internet wave, Amazon shaping e-commerce, Zalando successfully scaling 
e-commerce in apparel, and easyJet helping to set the low-cost carrier trend.

2.  Shifting regional and product portfolios toward the most productive businesses or 

adjacencies. Examples include doubling down on product lines that have higher customer 
value relative to the hours needed, such as Nissan expanding electric vehicle (EV)  
offerings in automotive, and other players doing likewise for SUVs; Apple and Broadcom 
shifting their product portfolios to higher-margin services; General Motors exiting 
unprofitable geographies; and Amazon venturing into cloud computing through Amazon 
Web Services (AWS).

3.  Reshaping customer value propositions to grow revenue and value added. This strategy 
can be effective in both high-end niche segments and mass markets, and it often comes 
in response to trends or competitive attack. Examples in mass markets include US retailer 
The Home Depot improving customer experience both in-store, with a wider assortment 
and denser network, and online, integrating buying online and picking up in-store; and UK 
supermarket chain Tesco responding to pressure from hard discounters in addition to cost 
reduction, portfolio adjustments, and price reductions by improving the premium assortment 
offering and fully leveraging its convenient locations. US airlines including Delta and 
American Airlines provided distinct value propositions and value-added services to loyalty 
customers. In niche segments, examples include Nvidia building a winning value proposition 
for graphics processing units (GPUs) and scaling it up; Zeiss providing cutting-edge tech in 
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography; and Danaher in high-tech life sciences.

4.  Building scale and network effects. Examples of firms offering more for less include 

Amazon scaling its fulfillment capabilities to make them available to more shoppers and 
partner retailers; logistics conglomerate Hapag-Lloyd driving growth through acquisitions 
and geographic expansion; and US airlines improving route networks and aircraft capacity 
utilization, including through mergers. 

5.  Transforming operations to raise labor efficiency and reduce external cost at scale. 
Examples include Tesco’s multibillion-pound cost-reduction program (in addition to 
competing on price and quality with discounters) and easyJet’s fleet modernization to reduce 
operating cost (alongside shaping a winning customer value proposition). While this is the 
lever most commonly associated with productivity growth—at least among businesses—it 
was very rarely the most important one in our case studies.

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityThese moves often trigger chain reactions that lead to bursts of productivity over specific 
periods and sectors in a pattern of “action and response” more than through the diffusion of 
practices. For instance, the entrance of digital players and discounters in the UK retail sector not 
only directly boosted productivity in that economy but also prompted responses from other firms, 
one instance being Tesco enhancing its own offering with a stronger online channel and deeper 
customer relationships through loyalty and personalized offers.

Firms in different parts of the productivity curve made bold strategic moves, which help to 
explain their movements along that curve. Take the retail sector as an illustration (Exhibit 4). In US 
retail, firms such as Amazon, Costco, and The Home Depot were Standouts in the productivity 
frontier. In German retail, Standouts carried out bold strategic moves and transitioned to the 
frontier. Examples include Zalando, which scaled up its e-commerce business from negative 
productivity levels and traveled all the way to the frontier, and REWE, which launched and scaled 
digital offerings even while expanding its brick-and-mortar business. In UK retail, contributions 
also came from Standouts outside the frontier, one instance being Tesco.

Bold strategic moves often trigger 
chain reactions that lead to bursts 
of productivity over specific periods 
and sectors in a pattern of “action 
and response” more than through 
the diffusion of practices.

matter for growth
Beyond the presence of Standouts and absence of Stragglers, the following patterns 
characterized subsectors and countries that posted rapid productivity growth:

 — Frontier firms contributed disproportionately. In the highest-growth subsectors, the primary 
pathway to productivity growth was firms contributing from the frontier, followed by firms 
transitioning to it.17

 — Leaders pulling ahead drove rapid subsector growth as often as laggards catching up. A 

common view is that productivity growth is particularly strong when the broad swath of middling or 
lagging firms catches up or converges with innovative leaders as best practices and technologies 
cascade down. Such convergence appeared in four out of nine subsectors with fast growth. In 
the other five, rapid growth came from frontier firms pulling further ahead—divergence.18

 — Employment reallocation from lagging to leading firms mattered nearly as much as 
productivity advances within firms and more than new entries or exits. In almost all 
subsectors, both productivity advances and employment reallocation played a role. In eight of 
21 subsectors with positive productivity growth, reallocation of employees from less to more 
productive firms dominated. In the others, productivity increases by individual firms mattered 
more.19 Firms leaving or entering the market—traditional creative destruction—mattered less. 
It is notable that, in virtually all positive-growth subsectors, exits added to growth, sometimes 
substantially, while in almost half of these subsectors, entries detracted from growth. New 
entrants proved too small or unproductive to leave a mark during the 2011–19 snapshot 
period.20 Over a longer period, every Standout will have been a new entrant at some point, but 
the youngest firm in our eight-year sample was 11 years old, and the average was 58.

US sample firms led on productivity growth with more Standouts,  
fewer Stragglers, and more reallocation
US productivity growth from 2011 to 2019 was faster than that of the other countries in our 
sample at 2.1 percent, compared with 0.2 percent in Germany and close to zero in the United 
Kingdom. Two patterns help explain this difference, as follows: 

 — The US sample had three times more Standouts than Stragglers, while the German and 

UK samples had almost even numbers. This was largely due to the strong US computer and 
electronics sector, which accounted for about half the Standouts in the United States and 
most of the difference in the total number compared with Germany and the United Kingdom. 
This could reflect the more vibrant US innovation ecosystem—the market is less fragmented, 
regulation is more innovation- and investment-friendly, and the risk-capital system is well 
developed. But even beyond this special sector, the same pattern is present.21

 — Firms in the US sample had more reallocation of employees from less productive to more 

productive firms. Leaders grew faster, and underperforming firms more swiftly restructured 
or exited. In the United States, Standouts include scalers (firms far above average sector 
productivity that contribute by gaining employees) and restructurers (firms with below-
average sector productivity that contribute by losing employees). In Germany and the 
United Kingdom, this was not the case. Rather, these countries preserved underperforming 
firms as Stragglers. Frontier firms scaling and gaining share added 0.6 percentage point 
to productivity growth in the United States, and unproductive firms exiting contributed 
an additional 0.5 percentage point. Overall, dynamic reallocation, including reallocation 
across subsector boundaries, added 0.9 of 2.1 percentage points—slightly less than half—to 
productivity growth in the US sample.22 In contrast, the contribution of reallocation was 
negligible in Germany and the United Kingdom (Exhibit 5). This may be explained by the fact 
that the United States has highly dynamic factor markets, allowing for quick entry and exit as 
well as fast scale-up and restructuring.

A new productivity growth playbook emerges 
Business leaders and policymakers should focus on productivity growth because it is a win-win 
for all, and achieving it requires a micro-to-macro, firm-level approach. This research both builds 
on and diverges from the large body of work on productivity in important ways.

Firms boosting productivity deliver a win-win for employees, customers, shareholders,  
and economies 
Firms rightfully focus on revenue, economic profit, and shareholder value, but they should also 
care about productivity growth for the following three reasons: 

 — For long-term success, firms need to serve customers, pay workers, and reward shareholders 
well, and productivity growth is one of the only ways to achieve that in combination. Indeed, 
this research shows that firms with the highest productivity growth can not only afford—and 
award—the fastest wage growth and have the largest profits upside (Exhibit 6).23 Sectors with 
the fastest productivity growth also generate the highest consumer surplus.

 — Economic growth is a key ingredient in business expansion and success, This research shows 

that just a handful of Standouts can create that growth rather than just react to it.

 — Given long-term demographic shifts and today’s tight labor markets, growing labor 
productivity is a strategic imperative. Doing so can create more value from a scarce 
workforce and enable the higher wages needed to attract the best talent, thus underpinning 
growth and gains in market share.24

Our findings prompt new ways of thinking on how to unlock productivity growth 
Six shifts in the conventional wisdom on productivity growth emerge from our findings (Exhibit 7). 
Some of them challenge prevailing views—for example, the shift from seeing productivity 
generated through improvements within the broad swath of companies through the diffusion of 
practices to seeing productivity arising from the bursts of just a few firms. Others add renewed 
emphasis or nuance, such as the importance of dynamic reallocation mostly toward well-
established leading firms as well as entries and exits.

Each of the shifts in thinking raises the following critical questions for business and policy leaders:

1. 

2. 

 A few firms driving productivity growth instead of the broad swath. Policies designed to 
boost productivity growth have tended to focus on a mix of foundational enablers, rooted 
in the view that a wide range of firms gradually enhance productivity. They also tend to 
include specific policies supporting smaller firms in the adoption of better practices. But 
the significant role of Standouts may call for an asymmetric approach that matches the 
asymmetric contributions of firms.25 In what sectors are there too few Standouts or too many 
Stragglers, and what can be done? What tailored approaches could help firms remain or 
become Standouts, and which barriers could be removed?

 Incumbent improvers as much as superstars and disruptors. Our analysis suggests that 
there is a diversity of ways to become a Standout, and all are needed for national (or sector) 
productivity growth. The majority of Standouts are large incumbents achieving productivity 
gains over time (improvers) like Tesco and United Airlines. Only about 20 percent are scalers 
that lead from the front (these scalers could be most similar to superstars, which are often 
defined as firms with the greatest share of economic profit) like Amazon and Apple.26 An 

17

4. 

5. 

additional 10 percent of Standouts are smaller disruptors (which are still far larger than any 
MSME) like Zalando. How can large incumbents remain agile and innovative enough to remain 
or become Standouts?

 Bold action and response more than imitation. Some imitation and diffusion of best 
practices from leaders to laggards occur, but the real engine of productivity growth is bold, 
idiosyncratic strategic moves to which competitors then respond. To better shape or respond 
to newly emerging technologies and business models, what can firms do, and what is the 
role of policy? What talent strategies and educational policies can nurture technology and 
innovation capabilities as well as managerial leaders who can make bold strategic moves?

 Strategy, portfolio shifts and value creation more than efficiency. Operational efficiency 
matters, but firm-level productivity growth largely comes from strategic moves that unlock 
more productive business models and portfolios, customer value, or innovation at scale. How 
can firms reinvent business models and customer value as they seek productivity advances 
from new technology, including artificial intelligence? Where and how can M&A play a role?

 Scaling innovation more than creating new entrants. Innovation by young companies that 
then grow fills the funnel of future Standouts, but it is Standouts scaling innovations that 
power productivity growth in the medium term. Businesses need to have the right strategy 
and deploy at scale. What is the right policy balance between preventing excessive market 
concentration and encouraging leading firms that can move the needle for their home 
economies? Could there be more proactive approaches to support innovative MSMEs 
or startups that could scale and contribute to growth while triggering consolidation of 
others? How can businesses strengthen the capabilities and ecosystems needed to deploy 
innovation at scale?

6.  Dynamic reallocation toward leading firms and business units as much as internal 

improvements. Firms increasing their productivity level matters for growth, but an equally 
important channel is the exit of unproductive firms and moves of employees (and capital 
as well as customers) from less productive to more productive enterprises. Within firms, 
too, shifting resources to higher-value activities is key. Can business leaders rethink their 
governance to allow decisive resource reallocation? What policies can support dynamic shifts 
in jobs to the most productive firms and help less productive ones turn around or restructure? 

By looking through a firm-level lens with detailed case studies on the perennial issue of 
productivity, new insights and fresh ways of thinking about productivity growth have emerged. 
We hope that this research helps to advance understanding of productivity growth and suggests 
ways forward—and, certainly, areas for further debate and research.

An 8,300-firm lens on 
productivity growth

This research measures growth in real value per worker or labor productivity, focusing on  
the actions and contributions of individual firms. For this firm-centered lens, we have 
constructed a lab economy. This chapter may be particularly helpful for business readers 
to understand how this productivity metric varies from profitability and efficiency, and for 
academic and policy readers to note the ways our sample is different from, but relevant to, 
national economic statistics.

Measuring labor productivity and firms’ contributions to its growth
We define labor productivity at the firm level—as real value added per worker—in a way that is 
consistent with adding up to economy-wide productivity (and growth). Growing real value added 
per worker drives prosperity for economies and enables firms to thrive, especially when labor 
markets are tight. This is very different from the profitability and efficiency metrics on which 
executives commonly focus. 

Firm-level labor productivity is real value added per worker rather than efficiency or profitability
Value added is the value of goods and services provided to customers minus what has been 
purchased from suppliers. At the firm level, this can be measured as revenue minus external cost 
or, equivalently—and used in this research—as EBITDA plus labor compensation.27

Real value added per worker, and its growth, differ from the way business leaders may think of 
productivity growth in the following three ways:

 — First, it is a per-employee measure rather than representing the total value or profits of a firm.28 

 — Second, value added includes benefits accrued by all stakeholders (shareholders, customers, 
workers, creditors, and tax authorities). This is a very different metric from profitability or labor 
efficiency, such as, for instance, the number of vehicles produced by each worker in a factory. 
Raising production efficiency matters, but typically a much larger share of labor productivity 
growth stems from top-line growth, including shifts in the business portfolio mix (see the next 
section for more on the relationship of value added per worker to profitability and wages). 

 — Third, we measure the growth in value added per worker in real terms, adjusting nominal 

figures for changes in output and input prices at the sector level by using so-called double-
sided deflators. These deflators account for both quality-adjusted price changes that firms 
in a particular subsector make vis-à-vis their customers and those they experience from 
their suppliers.29 We use granular sector-level deflators, acknowledging that there are likely 
firm-specific price effects and input costs that we are unable to measure (please see more on 
double-sided deflators in the technical appendix).30

20

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityLet us illustrate the growth in real value per worker using the example of a very well-known firm: 
Apple. Apple’s nominal EBITDA more than doubled in the 2011–19 snapshot period of our lab 
economy, while nominal personnel costs nearly tripled. However, after applying the double-sided 
deflator specific to the computer and electronics sector, real GVA increased by 12.3 percent per 
year. This outstripped annual growth in the employee headcount of 10.8 percent. Apple therefore 
achieved a productivity increase of 1.4 percent per year (Exhibit 8).

Growth in value added per worker typically comes with growth in wages and profits
Businesses often look at the return on invested capital (ROIC, or r in the formula below). Raising 
productivity or real value added per worker does link to growth in ROIC, but there are many other 
contributing factors. They include capital deepening (or equipping workers with more capital), 
raising their wages more strongly than prices, and increasing consumer surplus by producing 
higher-quality or lower-priced goods and services (this is reflected in the sector’s double-sided 
deflator).31 A simple formula ties them together:

P = d[k (r + s) + w]

Where P = productivity or value added per worker in real terms, d = deflator for price/ 
quality adjustments, k = invested capital per worker, r = pretax return on invested capital,  
s = depreciation rate, and w = average wage.

At an aggregate level, it has long been acknowledged that a higher share of productivity growth 
tends to accrue to workers than to profits.32 The labor share of income tends to be about two-
thirds (with variations over time and among economies).33 Our sample shows that firms with the 

21

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityhighest productivity growth consistently increased wages more than their peers. In fact, this 
relationship was stronger than the link between productivity growth and profits per employee, 
because profits swing more quickly and widely, while wages tend to be sticky (Exhibit 9).34

The reallocation of workers across firms is a key component in productivity growth
Productivity growth can come from firms creating more value per worker (the “firm productivity 
effect”) but also from the most productive firms gaining market and employment share—or the 
least productive ones losing share or exiting (the “reallocation effect”). The latter occurs through 
the movement of employees across firms. 

The firm productivity effect includes all gains that individual firms make to the value they 
generate per worker. These result from, for instance, innovating or making operational 
improvements, but also from major shifts in strategy to capture new markets and increase 
customer value. 

The reallocation effect measures the impact of more productive firms gaining market share 
and employment relative to less productive ones. Some of the latter even go out of business, 
releasing workers to be redeployed more productively. 

A single firm can contribute through both effects. For detail on how we calculate this effect, see 
sidebar “Illustrative productivity contribution calculation” and the technical appendix).35

Illustrative productivity  
contribution calculation

Let us illustrate a firm’s contribution to 
sector- and economy-level productivity 
growth using Apple as an example. In 
Exhibit 10 in the previous section, we 
illustrated the company’s growth in 
productivity per employee of 1.4 percent 
per year. Now, let us understand how this 

1.4 percent increase (in absolute terms, 
about $70,000) leads to a contribution of 
43 basis points (exhibit).

Apple’s total productivity contribution is 
calculated by summing its firm productivity 
effect and reallocation effect. For the firm 
productivity effect, we multiply:

(A)  How much the firm improved its own 
productivity level from 2011 to 2019 
(for Apple, by $69,800 per employee in 
constant 2019 prices) with

(B)  How large the firm is relative to the 
sector, measured by its average 
employment share across 2011 
and 2019 (for Apple, 4.1 percent of 
employment).

For the reallocation effect, we multiply:

(C)  How much more productive the firm is 
relative to its sector, on average over 
the period (for Apple, it was $456,000 
per employee more productive on 
average between 2011 and 2019, in

Several more steps are needed to compute 
the productivity impact of a firm at the level 
of the entire sample in a country:

(E)  Sector contribution—adding the 

productivity and reallocation effects 
gives us the total contribution of Apple 
to productivity growth in its sector 
sample, which is $17,200 per employee 
in computers and electronics.

(F)  Country contribution—weighting by the 
employment share of the sector in the 
country yields a $2,800 contribution to 
productivity growth across the country 

sample; for Apple, the computer 
and electronics sector made up 
16.4 percent of US sample employment 
share on average between 2011  
and 2019. 

(G)  Annual growth rate contributions—
annualizing this contribution into 
compound annual growth rate terms, 
Apple contributed 43 basis points of 
the 2.0 percent annual growth rate of 
the US sample. 

The 2011–19 period is undistorted by the global financial crisis or the pandemic, and 
displays patterns that may hold over time
This research does not provide an up-to-date benchmarking of the performance of countries, 
sectors, or firms, but it attempts to find patterns that may stand the test of time. We chose a 
discrete snapshot in time from 2011 to 2019, a reasonably stable period between the 2008 
financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.36 The choice of period matters. In this period, 
aggregate productivity growth in Europe and the United States was exceptionally slow due to a 
collapse in investment following the global financial crisis, together with the end of an offshoring 
wave and a normalization in productivity growth of the computer and electronics sector following 
exceptionally rapid previous advances that were linked to Moore’s law.37

When we tested our 2011–19 findings for a smaller sample in a more recent period, from 2019 to 
2023, we found that the cast of characters changes but the plot lines are remarkably similar. The 
broad patterns identified in this report appear to continue to hold true.38

Building a sample of 8,300 large firms as a representative ‘lab economy’ 
Our sample comprises about 8,300 large domestic and multinational firms headquartered 
in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States operating in four sectors and their 
12 subsectors. These sectors are a good mix of different types and dynamics, and cover 10 to 
15 percent of total private GVA in the three countries: 

 — Retail including apparel, grocers and nonspecialized retailers, and other retail

 — Automotive and aerospace including automotive manufacturing, aerospace manufacturing, 

and other transportation manufacturing

 — Travel and logistics including travel, logistics, and postal

 — Computers and electronics including computer, semiconductor, and electronic equipment 

manufacturing

Our sample covers the bulk of the productivity growth generated in these sectors and is relevant 
for national economies. We chose to look at our sample firms; we opted not to segment domestic 
operations or add the long tail of MSMEs.

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityThe sample covers the two-thirds of value generated by large firms that are the source of 
the bulk of productivity growth 
Our sample firms are representative of more than their fair share of productivity growth of 
the sectors in their respective countries. In the national statistics for the sectors in our scope, 
large firms accounted for two-thirds of total GVA. Our sample covers the bulk of that value plus 
additional international exposure, but not that of MSMEs and startups (Exhibit 10). Large firms 
accounted for at least 70 percent of productivity growth. At the country level, they generated 
70 percent of US and UK productivity growth (positive in the United States, negative in the 
United Kingdom), and nearly 100 percent in Germany. In most sectors, MSMEs usually accounted 
for higher shares of the productivity drag—with exceptions.39

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityMSMEs have a crucial role in productivity growth. A few of them, together with startups, will 
become the large firms of the future and fill the funnel of future Standouts. Previous research has 
found that these enterprises have a more dramatic “up or out” dynamic than large firms; although 
exits are more likely, surviving firms can often grow faster than mature ones.40 Research in the 
United States, for example, shows that most startups either exit or fail to achieve growth, but 
those that survive become high-growth firms. They contribute disproportionately to job creation, 
productivity, and experimentation that then becomes productivity-enhancing innovation by 
large, well-established firms.41

However, national statistics show that MSMEs’ average contribution to aggregate productivity 
growth is not as significant as that of large firms. This holds true for productivity levels. In the 
sectors we cover in the United States, the productivity level of large firms was 40 percent 
higher than that of their MSME counterparts. Previous MGI research found that large firms also 
often act as anchors for broader ecosystems in which MSMEs thrive, helping them to close 
productivity gaps.42

The sample includes firms’ global footprints
Large, multinational corporations are increasingly important to local and global economies, and 
we chose to look at their entire operations rather than segmenting domestic operations.43 For 
this reason, the coverage of some sectors’ GVA can exceed 100 percent. In the US computer and 
electronics sector, for example, large companies account for about 80 percent of GVA, but our 
sample includes the global footprints of those large companies, which almost doubles domestic 
sector GVA. 

Our sample includes many multinational firms. Indeed, we estimate that, in aggregate, 10 to 
30 percent of sample revenue is likely to be international.44 Shares of international value added 
are likely to be significantly lower than these foreign revenue shares, because many of the 
highest-value activities tend to happen near firm headquarters.

Standouts and Stragglers had a greater share of international revenue than other firms in the 
sample but still retained much of the value added in terms of both high-value employment and 
profits domestically. For example, about 50 percent of Apple’s revenue came from foreign 
activities in 2019, but almost 70 percent of its direct employees were based in the United States. 
In our snapshot period, Apple doubled the number of US employees, contributing to US domestic 
productivity growth.45

Sample productivity growth maps relatively well to that of national economies 
The productivity growth of our sample matches that of national economies relatively closely 
despite different parameters (Exhibit 11).46 Exceptions include the German and UK retail sectors, 
where MSMEs have relatively higher shares of value added and there are missing global effects.47

1GVA shares by firm size calculated using revenue as proxy for the US and nominal GVA as proxy for Germany and the UK due to data split by sector and firm size 
constraints. When using revenue for Germany to test for consistency, shares by firm size were held similar. For the US, the cutoff for large companies is set at

in-scope sectors in this analysis may differ from the ones calculated using a bottom-up firm by firm approach. This is because our bottom-up approach accounts 
for contribution to productivity growth does not account for reallocation impact of the movement of workers across sectors.

In order to understand how productivity growth is generated, our analysis focuses on firms, the 
vital creators and conduits of productivity performance. In the next chapter, we look at our main 
findings, which we believe are relevant for broader economies in whatever period is considered.

Advancing productivity 
one firm at a time

Just a handful of firms in our sample accounted for the lion’s share of productivity growth both by 
enhancing productivity within their organizations and by reallocating employees from the less to 
the more productive. These Standouts can have a substantial impact on the productivity growth 
of entire sectors and economies. 

A few firms shape the majority of productivity growth 
Productivity contributions—both positive and negative—are highly skewed.48 A small number 
of firms in our sample were responsible for the productivity growth (and drag on that growth) 
of entire countries. About 1 percent of our sample, or 87 productivity Standouts, added more 
than one basis point each to productivity growth in their country’s sample.49 These Standouts 
together employed 25 to 30 percent of the workforce but accounted for 45 to 80 percent of 
positive productivity growth, depending on the country (Exhibit 12). 

 — In the United States, 44 firms or 5 percent of the sample accounted for almost 80 percent of 
positive sample productivity growth and about 25 percent of sample employment (Exhibit 13).

 — In Germany, 13 firms, or less than 1 percent of the sample, accounted for 65 percent of 

positive productivity growth and for only 20 percent of sample employment (Exhibit 14). 

 — In the United Kingdom, 30 firms—again less than 1 percent of sample firms—accounted for 
45 percent of positive productivity growth and for about 30 percent of sample employment 
(Exhibit 15).

At the opposite end of the spectrum, a handful of Stragglers (making negative contributions  
of at least one basis point to the productivity growth of their national samples in 2011–19) 
accounted for the majority of negative productivity growth. 

 — In the United States, 14 firms or about 2 percent of the sample accounted for nearly 
60 percent of productivity drag and only 10 percent of national sample employment. 

 — In Germany, 16 firms or less than 1 percent of the sample accounted for more than  

65 percent of productivity reduction in the sample and nearly 35 percent of national  
sample employment. 

 — In the United Kingdom, 25 firms—again, less than 1 percent of the sample—accounted  
for almost 50 percent of the productivity reduction and just over 10 percent of national 
sample employment.

Fast productivity growth comes from more powerful Standouts and  
less influence from Stragglers
High productivity growth comes with more powerful Standouts and limited influence of 
Stragglers across countries, sectors, and subsectors. 

The United States sample led on productivity, with more Standouts and fewer Stragglers 
From 2011 to 2019, the United States achieved annual productivity growth of 2.1 percent, which 
significantly outpaced Germany’s 0.2 percent and the United Kingdom’s near-zero growth. A key 
differentiator was the Standout-to-Straggler ratio. In the United States, Standouts outnumbered 
Stragglers by a factor of three, 44 to 14. By contrast, Germany had 13 to 16 and the United 
Kingdom 30 to 25—a near-even balance. Only in Germany did Stragglers outnumber Standouts 
(Exhibit 16).

However, it was not only the relative numbers that mattered, but also their collective contribution. 
The contributions of UK Standouts were markedly weak, averaging just 2.8 basis points to 
productivity growth, compared with 5.3 basis points in the United States and 7.2 basis points in 
Germany. Meanwhile, German Stragglers imposed a particularly heavy drag, reducing growth by 
5.1 basis points. This was far greater than the reduction of 3.7 basis points in the United States 
and 3.6 basis points in the United Kingdom.

Much of the US productivity growth advantage came from the computer and electronics sector. 
Of the 44 Standouts identified in the United States, 29 were in this sector. Between 2011 and 
2019, computers and electronics accounted for just over 15 percent of sample employment but 
more than 70 percent of sample productivity growth. By comparison, the German sample had 
only four Standouts in computers and electronics out of a total of 13, and the United Kingdom just 
seven out of 30.

Fast sector and subsector growth also hinges on more Standouts and fewer Stragglers
Sector and subsector productivity growth shows a similar dynamic. We classify sectors as high 
growth if they achieved an annual productivity growth rate of 2 percent or more.50 At the most 
granular subsector level, this relationship remains evident—high-growth sectors have more 
Standouts, and these Standouts make larger contributions (Exhibit 17). This feature is the one 
common element in fast-growing sectors and subsectors; in our exploration of what drives 
rapid productivity growth, we otherwise found a high degree of heterogeneity, as we discuss in 
chapter 4.

by sector-based contribution calculations. In this case, the firm gains employment share relative to sector sample but loses share relative to subsector sample, 
which turns its employment effect negative. See technical appendix for more detail on cases like this.

to emerge
Do thriving sectors give rise to Standouts, or do Standouts forge the conditions for their 
success? While our research does not settle this debate, one thing is clear: firms—Standouts, 
Stragglers, and others—do not operate in a vacuum. They are shaped by both sector dynamics 
and the broader economic environment. 

Academic research outlines the importance of external drivers for differences in aggregate 
sector productivity, including pressures from threatened or actual competitors, trade 
competition, and effective regulation.51 In our sample, some subsectors had the market dynamics, 
technology, regulation, and competitive setting that provided fertile ground for Standouts to 
emerge and to drive value creation. Others were relative deserts, which did not encourage 
Standouts to grow and tended to produce more Stragglers.52

 — Fertile ground: Dynamic sectors with rapid innovation and improved customer value. 

Sectors such as computers and electronics have tended to be conducive to Standouts. Firms 
in this sector achieved quick productivity growth by creating or significantly augmenting 
customer value, as was the case with Nvidia, or were able to grow share in a rapidly growing 
market, Apple being an example. Some of these Standouts also acted as anchors that lifted 
the performance of partners and suppliers in a vibrant corporate ecosystem.53 Sectors 
characterized by these high levels of innovation and dynamism tended to have few Stragglers. 
Widespread innovation and market growth lift many boats. 

 — Relative deserts: Static sectors with less innovation. In some sectors, the balance between 
Standouts and Stragglers tended to be more equal, and strategies focusing on operational 
efficiency, consolidation, or portfolio reallocation were more common than new value 
creation. In the automotive sector, for instance, some players increased productivity by 
restructuring, General Motors being an example. Others, like Ford Germany, focused on 
raising efficiency. In postal services, several Standouts mostly improved efficiency or 
were restructurers. In addition, many Stragglers added volume in parcel delivery but not 
productivity. But these relative deserts did not determine the destiny of firms. In travel, 
for instance, which had below-average productivity growth in our snapshot period, many 
Standouts emerged. Examples include airlines that created scale economies through 
consolidation, and low-cost carriers that opened up new high-growth pockets. Deserts can 
become fertile ground, and vice versa.

Thousands of firms that are neither Standouts nor Stragglers matter 
collectively, too
Although a small number of firms in our sample in the period analyzed made an outsize 
contribution to productivity growth (positive and negative), the majority of firms played an 
important role in their economies. Non-Standout positive contributors together can account  
for more than one-third of positive productivity growth.54 More than 70 percent of other positive 
contributors increased productivity faster than the sector average. In fact, 20 percent of  
them increased productivity 1.5 times faster than the sector average while also increasing 
employment share. 

But even when we looked at non-Standout positive contributors, there was a high skew. In 
each of the three economies, about 10 percent of firms accounted for 90 percent of sample 
productivity growth. This holds for firms and subsamples of different sizes. For instance, we 
split the country samples into cohorts by number of employees—the 100 largest firms by 
size and the next 900. Even then, 10 percent of firms accounted for 65 to 85 percent of the 
positive productivity contribution in each cohort (although the second cohort contributed less 
in aggregate) (Exhibit 18). Therefore, adding a long tail of smaller firms to our sample would not 
have changed aggregate growth or this pattern much. Even looking at the millions of firms in an 
economy, only hundreds would account for the majority of productivity growth.

Of the four types of Standouts, advancing large incumbents were the 
most common
There are four ways to become a Standout: grow productivity a little while being large (becoming 
an “improver”) or a lot while being small (“disruptor”), change scale by growing employment share 
as a productivity leader (“scaler”), and cede employment share as a laggard (“restructurer”).

Improvers—large firms with decent but not rapid productivity advances—were the most common 
(Exhibit 19). 

 — More than a half of Standouts were improvers. Improvers are firms in the top 10 percent 
by number of employees that contributed largely by raising their productivity levels. On 
average, these large incumbents increased productivity by 5 percent a year. In the United 
States, improvers accounted for 35 percent of sample productivity growth. They included 
computer and electronics companies, such as Danaher, and airlines, such as American, Delta, 
Southwest Airlines, and United. In Germany, improvers accounted for about 60 percent of 
sample productivity growth. They included logistics companies, such as Hapag-Lloyd, as well 
as manufacturers, such as MTU Aero Engines, and retailer REWE. In the United Kingdom, 
improvers accounted for about 30 percent of sample productivity growth. They included 
retailers, such as Tesco, and automotive and aerospace firms, such as Airbus and Nissan. 

 — Ten percent of Standouts were disruptors. Disruptors are small by number of employees, 
typically representing less than 1 percent of the employment share in their sector. Similar 
to improvers, they contributed mainly by increasing their productivity levels, but at such a 
rapid rate—15 percent per year on average—that they were able to become Standouts. In the 
United States, disruptors accounted for just over 5 percent of sample productivity growth. 
They included semiconductor companies such as Nvidia, which increased its EBITDA tenfold 
from 2011 to 2019. In the United Kingdom and Germany, disruptors accounted for 2 percent 
or less of sample productivity growth. They included, for example, the German retailer 
Zalando, which shaped the online apparel retail wave.

 — Just over 10 percent of Standouts were scalers. Scalers contributed mostly by increasing 
employment share from a position of above-average productivity and were often in the 
top quintile of employment-weighted productivity. As employees moved into these highly 
productive firms, overall sector productivity grew. In the United States, scalers accounted 
for about 25 percent of sample productivity growth. They included Apple, which was 
already more productive in 2011 than other firms in the sector and doubled its employee 
headcount by 2019, as well as Amazon, Broadcom, and Qualcomm. In the United Kingdom, 
scalers accounted for about 5 percent of sample productivity growth. There were no scalers 
in Germany. 

 — Just over 20 percent of Standouts were restructurers. Restructurers also contributed by 
reallocating employees, but by lowering their employee headcount while having below-
average productivity. In the US sample, restructurers accounted for just over 10 percent of 
sample productivity growth. One US restructurer was the retailer Sears, which exited the 
market. Some restructurers left the highly dynamic computer and electronics sector, and 
two companies reduced their employment share by decreasing their employee headcount. In 
the German and UK samples, restructurers accounted for about 5 percent or less of sample 
productivity growth, and that was largely by exiting the market. 

Stragglers constitute the flip side of these types of Standouts. Two-thirds of them were large 
firms that decreased productivity per employee, or “anti-improvers.” “Anti-scalers”—large 
firms increasing their employment share despite below-average productivity—accounted for 
30 percent of Stragglers. Less than 5 percent of Stragglers were “anti-disruptors,” which were 
small by number of employees but still reduced productivity per employee substantially. One 
Straggler was an “anti-restructurer,” decreasing its employment share despite above-average 
productivity levels.

Standouts are diverse—in some ways confirming expectations, but in 
others defying them
The four types of Standouts highlight the diversity of ways in which a firm may make a significant 
contribution to productivity growth. In some ways, the anatomy of Standouts confirms what 
readers might expect about what it takes to be a Standout, but in others, it may be surprising. 
Standouts (and Stragglers) were mostly large, but not the largest, and outperformed for their 
size.55 In addition, Standouts generally had strong productivity levels and growth rates, but they 
were not in the top 5 percent on either. In fact, Standouts sometimes contributed from below-
average positions as restructurers. 

Standouts were mostly large, but most large firms were not Standouts
Standouts were predominantly large. In 2011, the average Standout had about 65,000 
employees and the smallest just under 500. But most large firms are not Standouts, and some 
are even Stragglers.56 By definition, size is a driver of a firm’s contribution to an economy’s 
productivity growth. Those in the top decile for employment in 2011 were eight times more likely 
than all firms to be Standouts (typically they were improvers), but they were also eight times more 

39

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivitylikely to be Stragglers. Almost 20 percent of Standouts had less than 0.1 percent of employment 
share each in their national sample in 2011, but they achieved very rapid productivity growth. 

Standouts contributed disproportionately to productivity, while large firms did not. For 
comparison, in the United States, the top 10 percent of firms by size that made positive 
contributions had 54 percent of the employment share but accounted for only 68 percent of 
positive productivity growth, while the Standouts had 23 percent share of employment but 
accounted for 78 percent of positive growth (Exhibit 20).

In the United Kingdom, employment and productivity contributions from the largest firms were 
more similar, but, on average, Standouts still increased productivity levels by more than 6 percent 
per year in comparison with 4 percent per year for the rest of positive contributors. This apparent 
discrepancy reflects the fact that firms can both contribute to and drag productivity through 
employment reallocation.

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityStandouts came from all parts of the productivity curve and were rarely in the top 5 percent 
Although Standouts appear disproportionately in the top quintile of the productivity curve (the 
frontier), many of them were outside it. More than one-third of Standouts, many of them scalers, 
were frontier firms in 2011, but the same holds true for Stragglers—about 40 percent were 
frontier firms in 2011.57

However, Standouts were rarely the most productive firms commonly studied in the dispersion 
literature.58 Let’s take the top 5 percent. In our US sample, for example, only three firms were in 
the top 5 percent in their sector in 2011 and were also Standouts. In the United Kingdom, only 
five firms in the top 5 percent were Standouts. Some firms in the top 5 percent were actually 
Stragglers (Exhibit 21).

The dispersion literature often attributes the dispersion of productivity levels to market friction 
that makes it difficult for laggards to catch up or for employment shares to shift to the most 
productive firms. We did not see this at the top end of the productivity curve in our sample.

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityThe most productive (the top 5 percent) tended to be relatively small businesses with very 
specific business models in hard-to-replicate niches. Examples include online game platforms 
and captive distributors in retail. Moreover, when we look at our Standouts, we see some 
considerable differences in productivity without obvious signs of market friction. There is no 
need for an offline food retailer to have the same productivity as an online store or a luxury goods 
chain, or for an automotive supplier to converge with an original equipment manufacturer, or even 
for an airline with outsourced ground staff to have the same productivity attributes as one that 
keeps those activities in-house. 

Standouts tended to generate above-average productivity growth but did not match 
the fastest growers 
Standouts across countries increased productivity at an average of 5 percent a year, but this 
was well short of the 20 percent per year that firms with top 5 percent productivity growth rates 
averaged. Only six Standouts were also in the top 5 percent in their country sample.59

Reasons for this are that the firms with the fastest productivity growth are often too small to 
move the needle, and that firms can make substantial contributions by reallocating employees 
rather than increasing productivity levels. 

Collectively, firms with the fastest productivity growth can also make notable contributions to 
aggregate productivity regardless of size and employment reallocation. One study finds that 
about 10 percent of firms with the fastest growth account for about half of productivity growth 
output.60 Yet in a sector like US retail in the early 2010s, this would mean about 250,000 of 
roughly 2.5 million enterprises.61

However, the contribution of Standouts and the skew of their contributions are orders of 
magnitude greater than this. In our US retail sample, just six Standouts, or about 3 percent 
of firms in our US retail sample of large firms, accounted for about 70 percent of positive 
productivity growth. If we added the long tail of MSMEs from the national statistics, the six 
Standouts would still account for about half of the sector’s productivity growth—and a negligible 
percentage of firms in the sample. 

Some Standouts were well-known ‘superstars’ in tech and other sectors, but many 
were not 
Some Standouts had the characteristics of superstar firms, but many were not. Superstar 
firms are often defined as firms that have the largest revenue market share and that achieve 
outsize gains in employment share or productivity, or as giant firms that use their size to drive 
productivity growth (often observed in firms with digital platforms). In previous MGI research, 
superstars have been defined as firms that generate the greatest share of economic profit.62

We find that only 10 percent of Standouts were “scalers” that are akin to superstars, and that 
about 30 percent of Standouts overlapped with firms that outperformed on economic profit.63 
The Standouts also come from a diversity of sectors. The computer and electronics—or  
tech—sector accounted for 29 of 44 US Standouts, but this was not the case in the other 
economies in our sample. In Germany and the United Kingdom, computer and electronics firms 
accounted for 30 and 20 percent of Standouts, respectively. In all three economies, Standouts 
included many firms outside the tech sector, such as auto manufacturers, airlines, and brick-
and-mortar retailers. 

Why? Superstar firms tend to be the ones with a unique selling proposition or business model 
that enables them to charge their customers considerably more than what they need for labor 
and typical capital compensation—and thus generate economic profit.64 Standouts excel in 
growing real value added per worker, which includes labor compensation and capital costs, after 
adjusting for changes in input and output prices and quality over time (at the subsector level). 

42

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityStandouts change over time, but two-thirds of those in 2011–19  
remained Standouts in 2019–23
To test whether the findings in our lab economy period hold over time, we looked at a small 
sample of Standouts and Stragglers from the 2011–19 snapshot period in a more recent period, 
from 2019 to 2023 (Exhibit 22).65

We found that around 65 percent of the Standouts remained Standouts, suggesting that 
their contributions are more likely than not to be sustained over time by virtue of the leading 
innovations or superior value propositions they offer. However, about 20 percent of firms that 
were Standouts in 2011–19 became Stragglers in 2019–23, and 60 percent of Stragglers in 2011–
19 became Standouts in 2019–23. The Stragglers of today may be a reservoir of future Standouts, 
and vice versa. The cast of characters may change, but the plot line remains consistent.

The finding that a small number of firms contribute most to productivity growth or drags is a new 
take. In the next chapter, we investigate what sets Standouts apart, exploring the key role of bold 
strategy that results in bursts of productivity growth rather than trickle-down diffusion.

Standouts trigger 
productivity bursts 
through bold strategy

What do the firms that contribute strongly to productivity growth do differently? To attempt to 
answer this question, we studied Standouts and Stragglers in four sectors—retail, automotive 
and aerospace, travel and logistics, and computers and electronics—in each of the three 
countries in our analysis: Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We looked at 
each Standout and Straggler in considerable detail, examining their annual reports and the 
dynamics of the sectors in which they operate, with additional insights from McKinsey experts on 
those sectors.66

A firm’s starting point on common business metrics (in addition to the size and productivity 
variables discussed in the previous chapter) is not the decisive arbiter of being or becoming a 
Standout or Straggler. Indeed, common business metrics offer little predictive value. Rather, our 
analysis finds that it is bold, idiosyncratic strategic moves made with ambition that set Standouts 
apart. Moreover, it appears that strategy that propels top-line growth, offers new customer value 
propositions, and involves portfolio shifts matters more than pursuing task efficiency alone. 

Standouts come from different starting points on common  
business metrics
Looking at common business metrics, including where a firm starts and past growth trajectories, 
tells us little about future Standouts and Stragglers.67

Some firms started in a loss-making position but became Standouts. One example is Germany’s 
Zalando, which shaped the e-commerce trend and significantly scaled both EBITDA and its 
employee base as it expanded across Europe. It had negative EBITDA in 2011 and was still a 
Standout. On the flip side, firms that started with some of the highest EBITDA margins in their 
sector—in UK retail, for example—ended up as Stragglers. 

Standouts have emerged from very different past growth trajectories. In our snapshot period, 
General Motors was a Standout in auto manufacturing, for instance. Its revenue growth was near 
zero from 2011 to 2015.68 Another auto Standout, Nissan UK, grew revenue at an annual rate of 
5 percent. 

Standouts can have very different capital expenditure shares of revenue. Take as an illustration 
the four largest US airlines—American, Delta, Southwest, and United—which were all Standouts 
in 2011–19. American Airlines invested between 7 and 15 percent of total revenue in capital 
expenditures in 2011–15, a simple average of 11 percent over the five-year period. United Airlines 
invested just 2 to 7 percent of total revenue in capital expenditures, or an average of 5 percent. 

45

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityStandouts also vary a great deal on R&D spending as a share of revenue, even when they operate 
in the same sector. From 2011 to 2015 in the computer and electronics sector, Standouts such 
as Broadcom invested 15 percent of revenue in R&D, while Danaher invested 6 percent.69 In 
aerospace manufacturing, MTU Aero Engines reinvested between 2 and 4 percent of revenue in 
R&D, while Airbus UK allocated 7 to 12 percent.70

Productivity bursts are more about top-line growth and business shifts 
than efficiency 
In view of the fact that common business indicators did not predict the Standouts and Stragglers 
of the future, we developed and compared in detail what each of the firms in our lab economy did 
in the 2011–19 snapshot period. 

We found that Standouts tend to set themselves apart by applying five strategic moves, often 
in combination, shaping the sectors in which they are operating and resulting in faster growth in 
customer value relative to labor hours or external cost—which is what is required for productivity 
growth. Most moves relate more to top-line growth and portfolio strategy than to operational 
efficiency. This strongly suggests that productivity should not be regarded as a euphemism for 
efficiency and cost alone. 

These moves elicit a response from other Standouts, which shift their own business and 
operating models and customer value propositions, compounding the productivity burst that 
results from the original strategic move. These responses cover the full spectrum of, or lead 
to, firms becoming improvers, disrupters, scalers, or restructurers. For instance, in US retail, 
Amazon scaled a more productive online business model (moving from disruptor to scaler). The 
Home Depot shifted into e-commerce while making its in-store experience distinctive, becoming 
the category leader for DIY (improver). And Sears was forced to exit (restructurer). Bursts of 
strategic action and response are the master key to growth. 

Stragglers have tended either not to act effectively or to move too late to adapt to trends and 
moves by other firms. Sometimes they faced execution hurdles that prevented them from being 
able to effectively deploy these approaches. 

Using our case studies, we share a few examples of the five different strategies Standouts 
used—often in combination—to boost productivity growth (Exhibit 23).

To see how firms contribute and apply the five moves in the context of a sector, see the  
sector vignettes at the end of this chapter. 

1. Scaling more productive business models or technologies 
In all four sectors that we examine in the 2011–19 window, there are examples of Standouts 
that adjusted their technological and business models to models that had inherently higher 
productivity, offered customers higher value, or required fewer workers than previously. 
Examples include Apple shaping the mobile internet wave, Amazon shaping and Zalando 
successfully scaling e-commerce, and easyJet succeeding in the low-cost-carrier wave. 

Shaping or scaling new market trends 
In computing, innovation in smartphones, two-in-one laptops (functioning as both a laptop and 
a tablet), and wearable technologies has fueled growth.71 Apple was at the forefront of this wave. 
Prior to 2011–19, it was a first mover with its iPhone and won a leading position in a fast-growing 
market—potentially with winner-takes-all dynamics—that was experiencing a sharp technology 
S-curve. During our snapshot period, Apple grew its core iPhone business and expanded 
its offering with the iPhone X in 2017 alongside new services, such as Apple Music, The App 
Store, and iCloud, to 52 additional countries.72 Average revenue per iPhone increased by nearly 
20 percent.73

Some Standouts in the air travel sector benefited from and helped shape the low-cost-carrier 
wave. They improved aircraft utilization, expanded capacity with more efficient planes and 
processes, and leveraged more extensive networks to deliver low costs to their customers. In the 
United Kingdom, easyJet responded to—and created—rising demand by targeting the discount-
seeking segment. It increased passenger numbers from 55 million in 2011 to 96 million in 2019.74 
In this period, the company achieved a 14 percent annual increase in real GVA while boosting its 
employee headcount by only 8 percent per year.

In retail, traditional German retailer REWE added online businesses while bolstering its brick-
and-mortar operations, notably in the discount segment with the expanding Penny Brand. In 

47

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivity2011, it launched its first online grocery store, adding a mobile app in 2017.75 It began investing in 
automating warehouses in 2014.76 From 2015 to 2019, REWE’s share of Germany’s e-commerce 
grocery market more than quadrupled; its share of offline grocery increased from 40 percent 
in 2014 to 47 percent in 2019.77 The company’s real GVA increased by 8 percent a year while its 
employee count rose by only 2 percent annually.

Riding the technology curve
Technology adoption was a core component of the ability of some Standouts to ride, and shape, 
the rise of e-commerce. Before and during the 2011–19 snapshot period, Amazon built and 
accelerated the e-commerce wave. German online apparel company Zalando is another case 
in point. In 2011, the company accounted for only 1 percent of employment and had negative 
productivity per employee. By successfully scaling its e-commerce platform, it reached the 
productivity frontier in 2019 even while expanding its workforce by almost nine times. On the 
back of its growing e-commerce business, Zalando expanded from its German home market to 
17 European markets by 2019.78

2. Shifting regional and product portfolios toward the most productive businesses or  
high-productivity adjacencies 
This strategy includes doubling down on product lines that have higher customer value relative to 
the hours needed, refocusing toward the most promising and profitable markets geographically, 
and expanding into valuable new or adjacent businesses with inherently higher productivity. 
Examples include Nissan building its EV product line, Apple and Broadcom shifting their product 
portfolios to higher-margin products, Zeiss and General Motors exiting unprofitable markets, 
and Amazon building its new cloud computing business with AWS.

Focusing on product lines with high customer value
Some Standouts in the automotive sector were quick to position themselves for the move toward 
EVs, which are more efficient to produce, with fewer parts, high automation potential, and less 
complex assembly work, and therefore lower labor costs.79 EV sales rose from 0.1 percent of 
all car sales in 2011 to more than 3.0 percent in 2019 in Europe, for instance.80 In the United 
Kingdom, Nissan Motor Manufacturing was quick off the mark, pioneering the mass-market 
Nissan LEAF, which was the top-selling EV in Europe in this period.81 In the United Kingdom 
alone, LEAF registrations rose from just over 600 in 2011 to nearly 25,000 in 2019.82 Nissan 
achieved a 9 percent annual increase in real GVA and kept employment growth at a much slower 
2 percent per year in the period we looked at.

Shifting to the most promising geographies and exiting unattractive ones
When product and geography combined to create large new markets, Standouts in our sample 
adjusted swiftly. Others cut back decisively, with some exiting less attractive markets, thereby 
raising their productivity. General Motors, for instance, emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 
and exited markets such as Europe, India, and Southeast Asia, among others.83 This lowered 
revenue and employee headcount but increased profitability. German optics and optoelectronics 
manufacturer Zeiss scaled up in more profitable regions. For instance, it increased revenue 
growth in Asia–Pacific by 13 percent while revenue declined by 3 percent in its home European 
market. For Smith & Nephew, a UK manufacturer of joint replacement implants, surgical 
equipment for tissue repair, and advanced wound management products, emerging markets 
were its fastest-growing segment in 2019, and the company expanded into China, India, and 
Latin America. In this period, these emerging markets grew by 12 percent while other established 
markets were shrinking.84

Moving into new and adjacent products and services with higher productivity 
Moving into lucrative new and adjacent products and services is a powerful driver of productivity 
growth.85 Amazon built its new profitable, scalable businesses with AWS in cloud computing. 
AWS grew faster than the company as a whole, accounting for more than 60 percent of operating 
income by 2019.86 Apple diversified into higher-margin products in adjacent accessories and 

48

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityservices, increasing revenue more than tenfold between 2011 and 2019. By the end of that 
period, such products accounted for almost 30 percent of total revenue.87

US company Broadcom, initially a leading semiconductor manufacturer, diversified into 
infrastructure software businesses. In 2016, it merged with Avago Technologies to become one 
of the largest semiconductor companies in the world, with leadership in networking, broadband, 
and data center markets. In 2018, it acquired CA Technologies, a developer of software for 
mainframe, distributed, and cloud computing.88 Its acquisition of Symantec followed in 2019.89 
This enabled Broadcom to enter the cybersecurity market, including endpoint security, 
network protection, and cloud security solutions.90 By 2019, 23 percent of revenue came 
from infrastructure software, compared with just 8 percent a year earlier. Overall, Broadcom 
increased revenue tenfold between 2011 and 2019.

3. Reshaping customer value propositions to grow revenue and value added, often in 
response to trends or competitive attack
Developing a unique selling proposition aligned with strong customer needs is a powerful way to 
add value and grow market share, thus contributing to productivity. This strategy can be effective 
in both mass markets and high-end niche segments. Examples in mass markets include US 
retailer The Home Depot improving customer experience both in-store, with a wider assortment 
and denser network, and online, integrating the option to buy online and pick up in-store. Airlines 
such as American, Delta, and easyJet provided distinct value propositions to their customers. 
And UK supermarket chain Tesco responded to attack from hard discounters—in addition to cost 
reduction, portfolio adjustments, price matching, and initiatives like its Clubcard—by improving 
the premium assortment offering and fully leveraging its convenient locations. Winning in high-
growth markets is also a key path to growth. Examples include Nvidia building the winning value 
proposition for GPUs, and Airbus doing the same in aerospace with the introduction of the A320 
line. In niches, Zeiss provided cutting-edge tech in EUV lithography, and Danaher did likewise in 
high-tech life sciences.

Differentiating in mass markets 
Firms that responded with differentiation to competitive threat were among our Standouts. 
US retailer The Home Depot sharpened its customer value proposition to take advantage of a 
booming DIY sector, which expanded by nearly 50 percent between 2011 and 2019.91 It continued 
to broaden its extensive product range and store network, established direct fulfillment centers 
to improve the speed of deliveries, launched the Pro Xtra loyalty program to cater to professional 
contractors, and focused on enhancing in-store customer service and experience.92 The Home 
Depot increased real GVA by an average of 7 percent a year and constrained growth in its 
employee count to 3 percent per year. 

As discounters entered the UK grocery market, Tesco invested in price matching discounters 
on most product lines and improved its assortment to offer differentiated products—think 
“Exclusively at Tesco.”93 The company already had the competitive advantage with its loyalty 
program and locations, which it further enhanced through online customer experience (for 
instance, personalized promotions) and diversifying formats to include more convenience stores. 

In airlines, carriers sought to battle fierce competition through differentiation and customer 
loyalty. Delta Air Lines, for instance, added revenue streams—10 percent of its 2019 revenue 
came from frequent fliers and their purchases of adjacent products.94 For American Airlines in 
2019, more than 15 percent of total revenue came from ancillary services, and 80 percent of 
this revenue was generated by members of the airline’s loyalty program.95 In Europe, easyJet 
differentiated itself from other growing low-cost carriers by offering valuable add-on services 
like allocated seating and bag drops as well as attractive routes.96

Winning in specialized niches
Having a winning product to meet niche customer needs also helps to unlock productivity. In 
2011–19, Zeiss spent about 10 percent of its revenue on R&D and doubled down on its most 

49

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityproductive semiconductor-technology segment with its winning EUV technology. By 2019, major 
semiconductor manufacturers, such as ASML, were using Zeiss’s cutting-edge EUV lithography 
for commercial purposes. Demand for Zeiss’s previous generation of lithography systems 
(deep ultraviolet) remained core but began to decline.97 The firm increased GVA by 8 percent 
and increased its headcount by just 3 percent. Similarly, specialized computer and electronics 
manufacturer Danaher consistently invested more than 6 percent of revenue in R&D to develop 
new products and services in its three core segments: life sciences tools and equipment, 
diagnostics and environmental products, and services. This paid dividends. For example, Leica 
Biosystems, which is part of Danaher’s life sciences segment, led the digitization of pathology 
slides for faster, more accurate diagnoses. 

Offering an attractive value proposition in high-growth markets
A number of technology companies were particularly adept here. For instance, from 2011 to 2019, 
Nvidia invested 20 to 30 percent of revenue in R&D to advance its GPU customer proposition 
from a gaming niche to mass market. By 2019, its GPUs were powering supercomputers as 
well as AI and machine learning. Moreover, the 2017 introduction of its Volta GPU architecture 
boosted Nvidia’s revenue from data centers by almost 90 percent annually between 2017 and 
2019. By comparison, the company’s core gaming business revenue grew at 24 percent a year 
over the same period.98 Nvidia increased real GVA by an average of 28 percent while limiting 
growth in number of employees to 10 percent per year. 

In aerospace, Airbus in Germany and Airbus Operations in the United Kingdom built a winning 
product—the A320 line—when demand was strong and increased real GVA by about 8 percent 
and 15 percent per year, respectively, with minimal change to their employee headcounts. The 
A320neo in particular was key, because the new engine offered better fuel efficiency for carriers 
at a lower cost.99 This became Airbus’s fastest-selling commercial jetliner, and by 2018, more 
than 75 percent of deliveries were from the A320 family.100 As a result, from 2013 to 2018, Airbus 
increased the number of deliveries by 28 percent, and by the end of 2018 it had an industry-
record backlog of 7,577 orders.101

4. Building scale and network effects to achieve more with less
Firms that secure economies of scale and scope add value faster than they expand their 
employee account. Those economies of scale could come from fixed or semi-fixed costs, such 
as network infrastructure; from shifting to the latest equipment and practices when expanding 
capacity or opening new factories without needing to write off existing ones; or from scaling 
intellectual property at near-zero marginal cost across offerings and customer bases. Some 
companies are even able to create network effects in which customer value rises the more other 
users and partners are present. Examples include Amazon and Zalando scaling their digital and 
fulfillment platforms; Nvidia launching its CUDA software for developing AI applications on top 
of its chips; American Airlines and other carriers in the United States “upgauging” (increasing 
the number of seats per aircraft) and merging to improve route networks and aircraft capacity 
utilization; logistics conglomerate Hapag-Lloyd driving growth through acquisitions; and Apple 
optimizing its supplier network through expansion.

Achieving economies of scale
Customer demand for air travel before the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 67 percent increase 
in passenger kilometers flown between 2011 and 2019.102 Several Standouts leveraged this 
demand by achieving economies of scale, sometimes through mergers and acquisitions but 
also by improving destination networks, capturing route synergies, and upgauging.103 In the US 
domestic market, American, Delta, Southwest, and United moved from a combined 48 percent 
market share in 2011 to 62 percent in 2019.104 American merged with US Airways in 2013 to 
create the world’s largest airline.105 Delta strove for organic regional consolidation, doubling 
its total share of passenger traffic to reach 30 percent in key passenger hubs.106 Southwest 
completed its integration of AirTran Airways’ operations and launched international operations to 
North and South America in 2014.107 Mergers and acquisitions were one strategy among several. 

50

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityIt is worth noting that airlines’ more recent performance on productivity growth has been mixed 
as the pandemic has continued to have a dampening effect. 

In the logistics industry, revenue increased by about 3 percent per year in our 2011–19 snapshot 
period due to rapid e-commerce growth, including in emerging economies such as China and 
India.108 Warehouses and logistics services expanded to meet retailers’ demand for supply chain 
support and customers’ expectations of quicker delivery times.109 Container shipping company 
Hapag-Lloyd captured economies of scale and boosted top-line growth and customer value via 
strategic M&A, global expansion, and improved customer experience. It achieved a 17 percent 
increase in real GVA but employment by only 8 percent per year in the period analyzed.110 In this 
time, Hapag-Lloyd’s acquisitions included Compañía Sud Americana de Vapores in 2014—a 
deal that boosted its Latin American presence—and the United Arab Shipping Company in 2017, 
which enhanced its competitiveness in the Asia–Europe trade corridor and expanded its Middle 
Eastern operations.111

Apple also benefited from driving economies of scale and improved productivity through 
supplier optimization and automation. For example, it switched from Samsung to TSMC for chip 
manufacturing and invested in predictive demand optimization and supply chain management 
with automation and AI tools.112

Developing network effects
By 2019, Amazon had nearly 30 percent of all US e-commerce sales, from less than 16 percent 
in 2014.113 To support increased demand and drive operational efficiency, it invested heavily in 
its supply chain and fulfilment centers, the latter expanding by nearly 800 percent from 2011 to 
2019.114 As it grew, the company leveraged network effects, for instance opening its logistics and 
fulfillment platform to third parties. Third-party gross merchandise volumes grew at 30 percent 
per year from 2015 to 2019, and revenue increased from its members-only platform Amazon 
Prime, which came with a large, loyal subscriber base.115 Overall, Amazon more than doubled its 
market share in all three country samples.116 It maintained very high—close to 90th percentile—
productivity even while increasing its employee count by 40 percent. Zalando pursued similar 
strategies, building fulfillment centers and supply chain capabilities and opening some brick-
and-mortar outlets.117

Nvidia also benefited from network effects with the 2007 introduction of its CUDA software, 
which became the go-to developer tool and the industry standard for advancing AI. In 2012, the 
AlexNet neural network, which was built using CUDA software, outperformed other models and 
solidified the leading position of Nvidia’s GPUs and software in the AI value chain.118

5. Raising operational efficiency and reducing procurement cost, often in response to 
attack or in turnarounds 
Companies can enhance their productivity performance through operational and supply chain 
transformation or continuous improvement. Approaches that can help companies get the most 
out of their workforce include lean operating principles, process redesign, organization and 
operating model redesign, improved automation and tools, and staff training. Firms can also 
retain value and enhance productivity by managing what is spent on external suppliers by, for 
instance, outsourcing and offshoring, and by managing supplier and partner networks using 
stringent category and specification management in procurement. 

There are many examples of Standouts that, along with bursts of strategic action, also acted to 
raise efficiency and cut costs. For instance, while Tesco refocused on its core, it also improved 
efficiencies and reduced employee count over the period.119 In Europe, easyJet modernized 
its fleet, securing significant discounts through large order commitments with its suppliers, 
helping to lower operational cost and spending on fuel.120 In parallel to optimizing its product 
portfolio and a series of acquisitions, Danaher also implemented operational efficiencies. For 

51

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityexample, in 2019 it spun off its dental business, which had contributed 12 percent of sales but 
underperformed on profit margin.121 It also implemented its Danaher Business System, a set of 
tools and processes for continuous improvement alongside efficiency measures, which included 
workforce reduction programs and increased use of offshore and contingent labor.122

Firms in our sample became Standouts in the period from 2011 to 2019 by applying one or more 
of five strategic moves in response to sector context and dynamics. Doing things differently, 
often through portfolio shifts, mattered more than doing more with less. Those firms that 
pursued multiple strategic moves in combination made outsize contributions to productivity 
growth, thereby reshaping the sectors and countries in which they operated and improving 
outcomes for employees, businesses, and customers.

Sector vignettes

Retail accounted for six of 44 Standouts in the United States, three of 13 in Germany, and ten 
of 30 in the United Kingdom.123 Of course, retail is a dynamic sector, and much has changed 
since 2019. Different firms moved to the top of the productivity distribution, and retailers had to 
find answers to the disruption of the pandemic. But the patterns and common themes, as well 
as the importance of a few firms and their strategic moves, will likely still be applicable today 
(Exhibit 24).

In the United States, Amazon, Costco, and The Home Depot led from the frontier. Amazon 
increased its share of employment while maintaining high productivity levels under its digital 
business model. Costco moved to the productivity frontier with steady growth in EBITDA that 
outpaced growth in the number of employees. The Home Depot more than doubled EBITDA as  
it built its competitive advantage in the booming DIY sector. 

In Germany, Zalando and REWE both transitioned to the frontier. Zalando went from 
e-commerce scale-up with negative productivity levels all the way to the productivity frontier. 
REWE contributed through revenue growth that outpaced growth in its employee headcount as 
it launched and scaled its digital offerings and expanded its brick-and-mortar business.

In the United Kingdom, three major retailers were Standouts from outside the frontier. They 
included Tesco, which responded to attack from hard discounters by optimizing costs and 
adjusting its portfolio’s strategy, enabling a strong core.

In all three sample economies, some retailers failed to respond to shifts in the market. Some 
exited the market and were able to contribute positively in this way. Other retailers remained in 
business but contributed negatively to productivity by failing to differentiate themselves from 
competitors or applying e-commerce models unsuccessfully.

Retail accounted for six of  
44 Standouts in the United States, 
three of 13 in Germany, and ten 
of 30 in the United Kingdom.

and aerospace 

Automotive and aerospace manufacturing—a sector comprising automotive, automotive 
component, aerospace, and other transportation equipment manufacturers—accounted for five 
of 44 Standouts in our sample in the United States, four of 13 in Germany, and two of 30 in the 
United Kingdom.124 Top automotive contributors in the 2011–19 snapshot period took advantage 
of growing and valuable geographies and product markets. 

In the United States, General Motors, following bankruptcy, streamlined its portfolio away from 
unprofitable markets and reduced its workforce by 3 percent per year, thereby boosting value 
added per employee by more than 30 percent.

In Germany, Standouts boosted value added per employee through pivoting to SUVs. At the same 
time, some large automotive companies were Stragglers in 2011–19. During this period, they 
were hindered by legal and other costs, but they improved their performance in 2019–23.

In the United Kingdom, Nissan, with its Qashqai model, successfully built and penetrated the 
growing SUV segment. Customers valued the vehicles more highly than traditional cars, but 
they did not require significantly more hours to produce. Nissan was also an early adopter of EV 
technology, which is less complex mechanically than traditional internal combustion engines. Its 
LEAF EV was the key product the company introduced to the market.125

Stragglers in auto manufacturing included companies that were late to embrace the strong trend 
toward SUVs and or did not make necessary geographic shifts, for instance failing to leverage 
the China opportunity. One auto Standout, for instance, pivoted to SUVs too late and was 
constrained by declining demand for sedans.

In aerospace, Standouts tended to be firms that reshaped customer value propositions and 
innovated. Airbus’ neoA320 product line became the go-to for airlines, enabling the firm to 
capture scale benefits and customer value. MTU’s refined geared turbofan engine drove revenue 
by unlocking higher fuel efficiency.126 Defense manufacturers also contributed by riding the 
tailwinds of increased defense budgets in international markets. 

The sector had productivity Stragglers, too. One US firm suffered from reduced defense 
expenditure in Europe and struggled with supply chain inefficiencies and cost overruns, reducing 
its operating margin from 12 percent in 2014 to 5 percent in 2019. Another Straggler was affected 
by military spending cuts in the UK market, reducing revenue share coming from the market from 
33 percent in 2012 to only 19 percent in 2019.127

Travel and 
logistics

Travel and logistics—a sector that comprises travel, logistics, and postal firms—accounted 
for four of 44 Standouts in the United States, two of 13 in Germany, and 11 of 30 in the 
United Kingdom.128

In the United States, where this sector sample made little (less than 0.01 percentage point) 
contribution to overall national sample growth, four firms were Standouts, and all were airlines. 
Delta, Southwest, and United led from the frontier, with American following closely behind, 
contributing from outside the frontier. These four Standouts together accounted for more than 
60 percent of the positive contribution of the sector while representing about 15 percent of the 
US sector sample’s employment share. All four contributed by growing GVA at a faster rate than 
the workforce. While each of these airlines benefited from increased demand in our snapshot 
period, they also capitalized by differentiating their value propositions and using mergers and 
acquisitions to benefit from economies of scale.

In Germany, Hapag-Lloyd, a container shipping company specializing in refrigerated and 
other special-care cargo, increased EBITDA at approximately 25 percent a year by pursuing 
international expansion strategies and supply chain advancements that unlocked value.

In the United Kingdom, just over one-third of top productivity contributors were in the sector, 
accounting for more than half of the positive gains of the sector while representing just a fifth of

the sector sample’s employment share. easyJet contributed from the frontier, riding the steep 
part of an emerging business model S-curve—the low-cost-carrier wave. This, in combination 
with optimizing its fleet strategy and differentiating itself from other low-lost carriers, enabled 
it to increase passengers served from 55 million in 2011 to 96 million in 2019.129 However, it is 
worth noting that in the years since, the COVID-19 pandemic has proved a challenge for low-cost 
carriers across all geographies.

In each of the three country samples analyzed, many companies benefited from rising demand 
in travel and logistics. But the Standouts also created economies of scale and efficient networks 
via consolidation, and several developed compelling value propositions in service quality, price 
points, and network expansions. Productivity Stragglers tried to follow suit but failed to realize 
the full operational efficiency benefits.

The computer and electronics sector, comprising computers, semiconductors, electronic 
components, and specialized electronic equipment, accounted for 29 of 44 Standouts in the 
United States, four of 13 in Germany, and seven of 30 in the United Kingdom.130 In 2011–19, this 
sector experienced robust productivity growth, especially in the United States.131 Of course, this 
is a dynamic and fast-moving sector that has seen many developments since 2019. However, the 
findings from our snapshot period still yield insights on strategies and approaches that appear to 
be broadly relevant (Exhibit 25). 

In the United States, Standouts such as Apple and Broadcom successfully expanded into 
adjacent higher-productivity revenue streams and created thriving new ecosystems, mainly 
through software, or seized the opportunity of being in high-growth niches to enhance growth 
and productivity through investment and innovation. Other Standouts, including Nvidia, 
successfully captured the growth of specialized markets by innovating. They made early, large, 
and highly targeted capital expenditures and R&D investments. 

In Germany, Zeiss transitioned to the productivity frontier as its EBITDA growth outpaced 
workforce growth driven by expansion to more profitable geographies, and its continued 
reinvestment of about 10 percent of annual revenue into R&D allowed it to win in specialized 
niches serving major semiconductor manufacturers.

In the United Kingdom, a specialized semiconductor manufacturer, Dialog, contributed from the 
frontier. Primarily supplying components to mobile systems manufacturers, it capitalized on the 
growth of the mobile internet wave. It also grew through acquisition, focusing on diversification 
following an initial period of high customer concentration.132 It increased its productivity 
contribution by growing EBITDA by more than 25 percent per year while increasing its workforce 
at a rate of approximately 15 percent over the same period.

In contrast, productivity Stragglers in all three country samples attempted to diversify their 
product and services portfolios but were not able to innovate sufficiently to capture the market 
opportunities or were unable to execute effective mergers and acquisitions.

The power of leading 
firms and dynamic 
reallocation

We now know that Standouts and Stragglers make disproportionate contributions to productivity 
growth in countries and sectors, but what about the full universe of 8,300 firms in the sample? 

Taking them all into account, we find that productivity growth can come from firms at different 
productivity levels, but that frontier firms contributed disproportionately. Indeed, leaders pulling 
further ahead drove rapid subsector growth as often as laggards catching up. 

The other noticeable pattern in productivity growth is the dynamic reallocation of employees 
from lagging to leading firms—a form of creative destruction. This effect was as important as 
productivity advances within firms and, indeed, was more powerful than firms entering and 
exiting the market, which is a more traditional definition of creative destruction.133 Exiting firms 
contributed positively to growth while new entrants did not. 

The United States outperformed on productivity on both of these dimensions. It had a stronger 
frontier and more dynamic reallocation than the other two country samples as well as having 
more Standouts than Stragglers, as discussed in chapter 2. US productivity growth from 2011 to 
2019 was 2.1 percent in our sample, compared with 0.2 percent in Germany and close to zero in 
the United Kingdom.

In this chapter, we shift focus to the dynamics of our full sample and find that the United States 
also had a more robust frontier, with more reallocation of employees from less productive to 
frontier firms and a strong contribution from exiting firms.

Frontier firms contribute disproportionately
Firms contribute to productivity growth through six different pathways along the productivity 
curve: (1) firms staying in the frontier and growing or advancing productivity; (2) firms staying 
outside the frontier; (3) firms transitioning to the frontier; (4) firms transitioning away from the 
frontier; (4) firms exiting; and (6) firms entering.134

In the highest-growth countries and subsectors, the primary pathway was firms remaining in 
the frontier. 

At the country level, firms that remained in the frontier made the largest contributions to 
productivity growth
Most of the positive contributions in the US and UK samples came from firms that remained 
in the frontier—1.3 percentage points and 0.4 percentage point, respectively. In Germany, by 
contrast, frontier firms made the largest negative contribution at minus 0.3 percentage point. 
Contributions from firms outside the frontier were also more meaningful to productivity growth in 
the US sample than in the other two (Exhibit 26).

Although in the German sample, frontier firms were a drag on productivity growth, those 
transitioning to the frontier made the largest positive contribution at 0.9 percentage point. Fims 
that transitioned away from the frontier were unsurprisingly a drag in all three economies, but 
particularly in the United Kingdom.

We note here that exiting underperformers boosted productivity while new entrants did not. We 
detail our findings in the next section, on dynamic reallocation. 

At the sector level, the picture is more mixed, but growth still hinges on frontier firms—
often pulling further ahead of the pack
Of the six pathways, typically only one was overwhelmingly significant in propelling subsector 
growth, and that single pathway varied depending on the subsector.135 For example, the US 
computers and US semiconductors subsectors were driven by frontier firms, such as Apple 
and Broadcom, scaling up employment. Subsectors driven by firms transitioning to the 
frontier included German aerospace. Airbus, for instance, moved to the frontier by increasing 
its productivity by more than 5 percent per year. Firms that remained outside the frontier 
contributed most in three of the nine high-growth subsectors. For instance, in the US travel 
subsector, productivity growth was driven by nonfrontier airlines improving their productivity. 

But in seven of the nine high-growth sectors, firms remaining in the frontier were either the most 
dominant or the second-most-dominant growth pathway. Even at a granular level, and despite 
the complexity, the role of frontier firms is clear (Exhibit 27).

This has profound 
implications for the ongoing debate on “convergence,” or the commonly held idea that 
productivity is generated largely by less productive firms catching up with the more productive 
ones over time as ideas and best practices diffuse. Such convergence did, indeed, happen in 
many sectors that were growing rapidly. But so, too, did frontier-led “divergence” as productivity 
leaders pulled even further ahead. Indeed, divergence was more common than convergence in 
high-growth subsectors (Exhibit 28).136

Apple pushed the frontier by both increasing productivity and gaining employment share. In 
the US semiconductors and travel subsectors, divergence happened as frontier firms rapidly 
increased productivity. Nvidia, for instance, moved into the frontier and pushed it further. In 
airlines, Delta was already in the frontier in 2011 and increased productivity from that position.137

Where convergence was present, it was not always a matter of laggards catching up. In US 
electronic equipment, nonfrontier firms increased their average productivity per employee and 
narrowed the gap with leaders. But in the UK electronic equipment subsector, convergence was 
mostly a matter of less productive nonfrontier firms reducing their employment share or exiting.

Only three low-growth subsectors experienced convergence. For instance, in German 
grocers and nonspecialized retailers, nonfrontier firms narrowed the gap with frontier firms by 
16 percentage points. Looking at negative-growth subsectors, in nine of 15 of such sectors, 
unproductive firms dragged down the nonfrontier average, leading to divergence from the 
frontier. Leaders pulling ahead were not enough to power overall growth in the subsector. The 
US automotive sector exhibited the strongest divergence. In 2011, the productivity level of 
nonfrontier firms was two-thirds that of frontier firms. By 2019, it was about half. 

Reallocation of employees among firms was nearly as important as 
increasing productivity within firms
At both the country and subsector levels, rapid productivity growth came from both firms 
increasing their own productivity and the reallocation of employees from less to more productive 
firms. In the United States, dynamic reallocation of employees to more productive firms 
accounted for nearly half of the sample’s productivity growth. Across subsectors, employment 
reallocation was the dominant effect in 40 percent of positive-growth subsectors. This finding 
reinforces the prevailing view that very productive firms gaining share can shift the average and 
boost productivity. It is also relevant to the debate on the balance between enabling the growth 
of leading firms and ensuring that there is adequate market competition—and, of course, the 
perennial discussion about the extent to which lagging firms should be supported.138

Nearly half of the US sample’s productivity growth came from reallocation, far more  
than in the UK and German samples
The US sample stood out for its dynamic reallocation of employees from underperforming firms 
to more productive ones, which created a strong frontier and less drag from underperformers 
(Exhibit 29). The reallocation effect added 0.9 percentage point—nearly half of the contribution— 
to productivity growth in the US sample.139 Most of this came from frontier firms scaling further 
and gaining employment share (0.6 percentage point) while below-average firms exited 
(0.5 percentage point). The reallocation effect was visible not only among Standouts and 
Stragglers but across the spectrum of sample firms. For instance, 40 percent of the positive 
contribution by non-Standouts came from the reallocation effect.

In clear contrast, the contribution from employment reallocation was negligible in the German 
and UK samples. Germany relied almost entirely on nonfrontier firms transitioning to the frontier 
by improving their own productivity. German sample firms also experienced a drag from frontier 
firms decreasing their productivity and from those falling away from the frontier but not shedding 
employment. In the UK sample, frontier firms gained some share.

Looking at reallocation through the lens of the four different types of Standouts, the United 
States provided an environment for scalers to gain share and restructurers to leave. Germany 
and the United Kingdom did not (Exhibit 30). US scalers, which included large and highly 
productive firms like Apple and Amazon, increased their workforce headcount while maintaining 
frontier-level productivity; they contributed 0.7 percentage point to productivity growth. 
Restructurers, such as Supervalu and Sears—both of which exited the market—contributed 
0.4 percentage point. In both the German and UK samples, positive contributions largely came 
from improvers, but they were offset by Stragglers, whose productivity level gradually declined.

Employment reallocation was the primary driver in nearly half of positive-growth 
subsectors
In 40 percent of the subsectors with positive productivity growth, reallocation of jobs from less 
productive to more productive firms was more important than improvements in productivity 
within firms. In the rest, the firm productivity effect was more prominent than the reallocation 
effect. Of course, both in combination power the fastest growth, as seen in seven of nine high-
growth sectors where firms made positive contributions through both (Exhibit 31).140

Declining productivity within firms was dominant in 11 of 15 negative-growth subsectors. Here, 
reallocation did not compensate, because firms kept staff despite weakening productivity.

Looking at creative destruction as largely a matter of firms entering the market displacing exiting 
ones does not capture the whole story. Exiting firms contributed positively to country and sector 
productivity growth by ceding the way for more productive ones. New entrants did not.141 This, of 
course, may reflect the fact that our snapshot period covers only eight years, arguably too short 
for newcomers to scale and make a measurable contribution to productivity. The youngest firm 
in our eight-year sample was 11 years old and the average 58 years. Over a longer period, they 
could potentially make a measurable contribution. More research would be needed to establish 
whether this is the case. 

Overall, employment reallocation to the frontier had a greater impact than the exit and entry  
of firms. 

This effect was particularly prominent in the US sample, where exits contributed 0.5 percentage 
point to productivity growth (Exhibit 36, above). This appears to reflect an economic and 
legislative system that enables unproductive firms to leave the market relatively quickly and for 
jobs to migrate to more productive firms. 

Exiting firms made strong contributions in high-growth subsectors outside the United States, too 
(Exhibit 38, above). In German computers, nine firms exited, and employees moving from these 
firms to higher-productivity ones contributed one of three percentage points of productivity 
growth. In the UK electronic equipment subsector, one-third of productivity growth came from 
the departure of six companies that had below-average productivity in 2011 and accounted for 
about 20 percent of subsector employment. 

New entrants made minimal or even negative contributions in all three countries and in eight of 
nine high-growth sectors.142 The highly limited impact of entries highlights the fact that making 
contributions to productivity growth takes time; becoming both productive and large enough 
to matter is not a quick process. In the 2011–19 snapshot period, new entrants remained 
too small, and many of them entered at below-average productivity levels.143 This does not 
mean that new entrants are not important for long-run growth. Some—but in reality only very 
few—of these firms eventually attain the productivity level and size to become Standouts, and 
some innovative firms merge or partner with Standouts to help improve their customer value 
proposition or efficiency. 

Looking beyond Standouts and Stragglers at all the firms in our sample, two patterns 
associated with rapid country and sector productivity growth are striking. First, frontier firms 
matter disproportionately, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. Second, 
the reallocation of resources across firms and sectors, from lagging to leading ones, is just 
as important as firms improving their own productivity. Creative destruction in the narrower 
sense of new entrants and exits played a lesser role. In the next and final chapter, we look at the 
implications of our findings.

A new productivity 
growth playbook

Productivity growth is a win-win for all stakeholders, but achieving it is hard. This micro-
to-macro, firm-level research offers insights that partly complement and partly challenge 
established ways of thinking about productivity growth. 

Firms boosting productivity deliver a win-win for employees, customers, 
shareholders, and economies
Business leaders justifiably emphasize profitability, growth, and shareholder value in their 
decision making. But there are three reasons productivity matters for the health of their 
companies: it is one of the only ways to serve all stakeholders; firms can actively create the 
economic growth they need to thrive; and it is especially relevant in times of tight labor markets.

First, productivity generated by firms is the only way to drive wages, profits, and consumer 
surplus at the same time. This is mathematical fact given that productivity growth is defined as 
growth in compensation per employee (wages) plus EBITDA per employee (profits), adjusted for 
changes in prices relative to quality (consumer surplus). 

There has long been debate about the relationship between growth in productivity and in 
wages. As discussed in chapter 1, productivity and profitability are different but related. Indeed, 
our analysis shows that there is a stronger link between productivity and wages than between 
productivity and profits (Exhibit 32). In our sample of more than 5,000 firms in Germany and the 
United Kingdom (firms in the United States publish less compensation data), the relationship 
between average wages and the productivity of individual firms was quite strong.144 Wages also 
tend to be sticky—70 percent of firms with declining productivity still paid increasing or steady 
nominal wages. Highly productive firms tend to be the best places to earn a healthy income.

Second, businesses together can create the macroeconomic growth they need rather than 
being passive players within economies.145 In the case of Germany, if there had been 19 more 
companies with the same productivity contribution as REWE our snapshot period, the 
productivity growth of the German private economy would have more than doubled in that  
period (Exhibit 33).146

Third, productivity is a strategic imperative given long-term demographic shifts and in today’s 
tight labor markets—which may remain tight for some time.147 Not only can a healthy rate of 
productivity growth create more value from a scarce workforce, but it can also make possible the 
higher wages needed to attract the best talent. 

Six shifts in thinking on productivity growth emerge from this research
The findings of this research shift thinking on productivity growth in six ways, each of which 
raises questions for leaders aiming to unlock it (Exhibit 34). Some of these shifts challenge 
prevailing views. One example is the finding in this research that a few firms using strategy to 
produce bursts boost productivity more than the broad swath of firms generating productivity 
through gradual diffusion. Others add new emphasis or nuance, such as the importance of 
creative destruction mostly via reallocation toward well-established leading firms rather than 
through entries and exits.

A few firms driving productivity growth instead of the broad swath 
Rooted in the previously prevailing view that macroeconomic growth comes from a wide 
range of firms gradually enhancing productivity, policies have typically focused on a mix 
of foundational enablers to foster a business climate conducive to this. These include 
infrastructure development, access to finance, and workforce training. They also tend to 
include specific policies supporting smaller firms in adopting better practices. Sometimes 
these are complemented by industrial policies targeting specific sectors. But the significant 
role of Standouts may call for a different, or at least complementary, way of thinking about 
what enablers could be most effective—an asymmetric approach that matches the asymmetric 
contributions of firms.148

 — In which sectors are there too few Standouts or too many Stragglers, and what can be 

done? The performance of firms is often tracked using standard metrics of business growth 
or stock-market performance. But alongside this approach, would it be useful to develop 
more individualized assessments to track firms and their contributions to productivity 
growth? What metrics could policymakers use? If we take the computer and electronics 
sector as an example, the United States has many Standouts while Germany and the United 

74

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityKingdom do not. How could they effect change? In other sectors, such as automotive, what 
could the United States do to nourish as many Standouts as Germany? 

 — What tailored approaches could help firms remain or become Standouts, and which 
barriers could be removed? Current Standouts and Stragglers, “dormant” large firms, 
and fast-growth disruptors are, in combination, likely to shape future productivity growth. 
What action would be most effective to help them to grow and create new value, or indeed 
restructure and turn around? What policies or approaches, today or in the future, might 
hinder their growth or their restructuring and turnaround? What is the right balance between 
a focus on preventing excessive market concentration and catalyzing the continued success 
of leading firms whose significant contributions to productivity growth can move the needle 
for their home economies? How can risks of preferential treatment or state capture be 
managed while taking focused steps to unlock the growth of future Standouts?

Incumbent improvers as much as superstars and disruptors
There has been much emphasis on superstar firms in technology and other sectors.149 But our 
analysis suggests that there are multiple ways to become a Standout, and all are needed for 
sector or national productivity growth. The majority of Standouts are large incumbents achieving 
productivity gains over time (improvers), like Tesco and United Airlines. Only about 20 percent 
are scalers that lead from the front (arguably most similar to superstars, which are often defined 
as firms with the greatest share of economic profit) like Amazon and Apple.150 An additional 
10 percent of Standouts are smaller disruptors (but still far larger than any MSME), such as 
Zalando. All of these types of Standout contribute, and none warrants overemphasizing. 

 — How can large incumbents remain agile and innovative enough to remain or become 

Standouts? Large incumbents are Stragglers about as often as they are Standouts, and 
are often represented among other firms that make positive contributions but are not 
Standouts. What distinguishes those that successfully reinvent themselves and stay ahead 
on new opportunities and trends from those that fall back? How can they all leverage their 
scale while being adaptable and driving productivity? Which ones need to restructure or 
sell to become Standouts? 

Bold action and response more than imitation
Some imitation and diffusion of best practices from leaders to laggards occur, but the real engine 
of productivity growth is bold, idiosyncratic strategic moves to which competitors then respond. 
This action-and-response dynamic generates bursts of productivity, which can be observed at all 
levels or units of economic activity (see sidebar “Productivity happens in bursts”).

 — How can firms better shape or respond swiftly to newly emerging technologies and 
business models, and what is the role of policy? Tracking new trends and competitive 
shifts is key, and action and response by firms help boost value creation. How can there be 
greater exposure to global ideas and competition? What mechanisms need to be in place for 
continued R&D investment to stay at the forefront? How can there be more experimentation 
and room to double down on what works? 

 — What talent strategies and educational policies could nurture the technology and 

innovation capability as well as managerial leaders who can make bold strategic moves? 
Firms should foster high-quality and bold managerial talent with sufficient foresight to 
propose, design, and execute ambitious strategy. This may be as important as nurturing the 
skills of the broader workforce.151

Strategy, portfolio shifts, and value creation more than efficiency
Operational efficiency matters, but firm-level productivity growth is mostly generated by 
strategic moves that unlock more productive business models and portfolios, customer value, or 
innovation at scale. 

75

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivitySIDEBAR
Productivity happens  
in bursts 

Productivity bursts happen at the country, 
sector, firm, and even plant level (Exhibit A).

Country bursts. At the national level, 
history provides multiple examples of 
rapid global productivity acceleration 
driven by a few individual countries. 
During the postwar boom in Western 
Europe, countries rebuilt their economies 
and made significant productivity gains, 
facilitated by investment, technological 
catch-up, and industrial modernization. 
They had 1.5 times higher growth than  

the global average from 1951 to 1970. 
China’s accession to the World Trade 
Organization in 2001 catalyzed two 
decades of rapid productivity growth, 
contributing about 25 percent of the 
total global productivity growth between 
2001 and 2006 as the country integrated 
into global value chains.1 Similarly, 
economies in Central and Eastern Europe 
experienced strong productivity surges 
after the fall of the Berlin Wall as they 
transitioned into being market economies 
and attracted foreign investment.

Sector bursts. In the United States, a 
significant burst of productivity growth 
in the 1990s came from the large retail 

sector as it transitioned to big-box formats. 
In the 2000s, there was a burst from a 
combination of a shift toward offshoring 
manufacturing and Moore’s law in 
electronics, which holds that the number 
of transistors in a microchip doubles 
every two years, signaling more broadly 
that computers grow more powerful and 
efficient while becoming less expensive. 
However, while Moore’s law initially 
translated into lower semiconductor 
prices and rapid gains for consumers, the 
effect waned over time. In the 2000s, 
innovation and adoption of information 
and communications technology boomed 
(Exhibit B).

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityProductivity happens  
in bursts (continued)

Technology bursts. Two of the forces 
we have just described that propelled 
large bursts in sector productivity were 
essentially related to technology and its 
use at scale. In reality, technological bursts 
have an impact at all levels. 

Firm-level bursts. This research shows 
that an effective way to think about 

productivity dynamics is what might be 
called “disruption and response.” In many 
sectors, a few firms disrupt the market and 
others then respond with their own ways 
to drive productivity. In retail, for instance, 
discounters disrupted many markets 
around the world. In response, other firms 
sharpened their value propositions and 
drove productivity. Tesco, for example, 
responded to attack from hard discounters 
through cost reduction and portfolio 
adjustment strategies while also leveraging 
its convenient locations. 

Process or plant-level bursts. Here the 
literature suggests that more traditional 
incremental diffusion is relevant, with more 
productive practices like lean operating 
being adopted initially for certain processes, 
products, or plants, and then rolled out 
within and across firms.2 But even here, 
progress on productivity can be associated 
with large bursts—for example, new 
plants tend to be equipped with the latest 
technology and process improvements, and 
new service offerings developed with the 
latest process design and software.

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivity — How can firms reinvent business models and customer value as they seek productivity 
advances from new technology, including AI? If this research is any guide, automating 
tasks and chasing efficiency—even when execution is smooth—will not be the primary value 
driver. Particularly with generative AI, today’s focus tends largely to be on process efficiency 
and cost cutting, but what about its potential to drive top-line growth? Where is the play for 
revenue and new value creation?

 — Where and how can M&A play a role? Are there bolt-on acquisitions to improve customer 

value, buy- and sell-side portfolio adjustments, or horizontal M&A for consolidation and scale 
efficiency options that could be considered? 

Scaling innovation more than creating new entrants
Innovation by young companies that then grow fills the funnel of future Standouts, but it is 
Standouts scaling innovations that power productivity growth in the medium term. Businesses 
need to have the right strategy and deploy at scale. MSMEs that neither innovate nor scale can 
fulfill many important societal roles, but they largely do not drive productivity.

 — How can the Standouts of tomorrow be nurtured? What policies may help startups to scale 
and raise productivity more quickly? Could there be more proactive policy approaches for 
supporting innovative MSMEs or startups that could scale while triggering consolidation of 
others, such as a “fail faster, scale faster” approach? What current policy frameworks may be 
fueling or stalling the rise of new industry leaders and the consolidation of those that are not 
likely to be leaders? 

 — How can businesses strengthen the capabilities and ecosystems needed to deploy 

innovation at scale? Are there opportunities for incumbents, disruptors, and young firms to 
collaborate? How can ecosystems that give incumbents access to new innovation and give 
young firms access to large markets and deployment platforms be built? How can venture 
capital and investment firms double down on scaling the most ambitious young firms and 
these ecosystems? 

Dynamic reallocation toward leading firms and business units as much as internal 
improvements
The exit of unproductive firms and shifts in employment from less productive to more productive 
enterprises is one of the most important channels of medium-term productivity growth. While 
this fact has been long understood in academia, this research puts renewed emphasis on it and 
highlights the outsize role of restructuring, particularly of large, ailing firms. We acknowledge 
that such restructuring or exits can be painful for workers and the regions they call home, and 
should best be paired with the growth of Standouts providing new opportunities. Even within 
firms, it is fair to say that reallocation of resources to higher-value activities is one of the more 
important drivers of productivity. 

 — Can business leaders rethink their governance to allow decisive resource reallocation? Do 
businesses have the operating model in place to conduct regular reviews and to be able to 
shift resources (employees, capital, and customers) decisively as opportunities arise?152

 — What policies could support dynamic shifts in jobs to the most productive firms and help 
less productive ones turn around or restructure? Large, unproductive firms can make a 
considerable contribution to productivity growth if they restructure effectively or leave 
the market in a nondisruptive way that enables their employees (and customers) to move 
smoothly to more productive firms. Could policymakers in Germany and the United Kingdom 
look at the experience of the United States, whose dynamic labor markets have delivered in 
this way, and reconsider the role of creative destruction in promoting productivity growth? 
For their part, what further action could US policymakers consider in order to ensure that 
such labor-market dynamism continues and is accompanied by broad macroeconomic 
stability, for instance?

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityEconomies rely on productivity growth to sustain prosperity, and firms depend on it to create 
value for their stakeholders. This report takes a fresh look at productivity growth by focusing 
on firms. This approach has uncovered new insights that complement conventional wisdom and 
some that offer a shift in how to think about boosting productivity growth. We hope our findings 
help reframe the discussion for policy and business leaders and point toward new avenues for 
fostering it.

8   MSMEs account for 30 percent of US and UK 

productivity growth (positive in the United States, 
negative in the United Kingdom, and near zero in 
Germany for the four sectors analyzed). Sectors 
with notable shares of MSME contribution are 
US retail and UK computers, as well as German 
and UK travel and logistics, where MSME GVA 
shares are significantly higher. Contributions were 
calculated using OECD firm splits by business size 
for Germany and the United Kingdom, and census 
data for the United States, applied to OECD 
productivity growth rates.

9   For more on the importance of young firms and 

innovation to labor productivity, see, for instance, 
Ryan A. Decker et al., “Changing business 
dynamism and productivity: Shocks versus 
responsiveness,” American Economic Review, 
volume 110, number 12, December 2020; John 
Haltiwanger et al., “High growth young firms: 
Contribution to job, output, and productivity 
growth,” in John Haltiwanger et al., eds., Measuring 
entrepreneurial businesses, Studies in Income and 
Wealth, volume 75, National Bureau of Economic 
Research, September 2017; and Daron Acemoglu 
et al., “Innovation, reallocation, and growth,” 
American Economic Review, volume 108, number 11, 
November 2018.

10  This finding is in line with existing literature, which 
holds that firms from different percentiles of the 
productivity distribution can contribute meaningfully 
to productivity growth. See, for instance, Trends 
in UK business dynamism and productivity: 2024, 
Office for National Statistics, December 3, 2024; 
and Bart van Ark and Mary O’Mahony, The UK’s 
productivity challenge: People, firms, and places, 
The Productivity Institute and Economic and Social 
Research Council, November 2023. 

11   We compared Standouts with the top 5 percent of 
firms by productivity level and growth, which are 
often identified in the productivity dispersion and 
diffusion literature, and found virtually no overlap.

12  To get to firms in the frontier, we first rank all 

firms by productivity per employee, then select, 
from most to least productive, the ones that 
collectively employ 20 percent of employees in 
our sample. For instance, consider an economy 
made up of only five firms and 100 workers. Firms 
are ranked from most to least productive. Firm 1 is 
the most productive, Firm 2 is second, and so on 
until Firm 5, the least productive. Once ranked by 
productivity, firms’ employment share according 
to their productivity rank is 2, 8, 10, 20 and 60 
percent. In this case, firms 1 to 3 are the most 
productive and account for up to 20 percent of the 
economy’s employment share. Therefore, firms 
1 to 3 are inside the frontier, Firm 3 defines the 
frontier’s productivity threshold, and all firms less 
productive than Firm 3 are outside it.

13  Our 2019–23 analysis compiles data from a variety 
of sources, including McKinsey Value Intelligence, 
S&P Global Market Intelligence, national statistics 
databases, IHS Markit, OECD, and the International 
Labour Organization. The subset of 114 firms 
was selected based on data availability for the 
2019–23 period and consistency of data quality 
when compared with the 2011–19 database. A 
manual review of firms was conducted where firms 
showing variation from the 2019–23 data set to 
the 2011–19 database were validated and updated 
where required using published financial statement 
data. Country- and sector-level productivity growth 
from 2019 to 2023 was calculated using publicly 
available data from national statistics for deflators, 
wage data, and real GVA. We acknowledge that our 
sample does not analyze the full population of top 
Standouts and Stragglers. However, we note that 
by analyzing the subset of firms for which data is 
consistent across both periods and using the same 
source of data for 2019 and 2023, we are confident 
that our findings are sufficiently robust to compare 
productivity performance over both periods.

14  Note that our 2019–23 analysis was performed on 
only 114 2011–19 firms for which data was readily 
available, and not the whole population of firms.

15  Inflation follows a similar pattern of idiosyncratic 

bursts rather than being driven by macroeconomic 
shocks. See, for instance, Santiago Alvarez-Blaser 
et al., The granular origins of inflation, BIS working 
paper number 1240, January 2025.

size and life-cycle growth of plants: The role of

of Economic Research working paper number 
27184, May 2020.

17  A frontier firm is defined as being in the 

employment-weighted top quintile of the firm’s 
sector. To get to firms in the frontier, we first 
rank all firms by productivity per employee, then 
select, from most to least productive, the ones 
that collectively employ 20 percent of employees 
in our sample. For instance, consider an economy 
made up of only five firms and 100 workers. Firms 
are ranked from most to least productive. Firm 
1 is the most productive, Firm 2 is second, and 
so on until Firm 5, the least productive. Once 
ranked by productivity, firms’ employment share 
according to their productivity ranks is 2, 8, 10, 20, 
and 60 percent. In this case, firms 1 to 3 are the 
most productive and make up to 20 percent of the 
economy’s employment share. Therefore, firms 1 to 
3 are inside the frontier, Firm 3 defines the frontier’s 
productivity threshold, and all firms less productive 
than Firm 3 are outside it.

18  We assessed convergence by looking at how the 
productivity of nonfrontier firms grew relative to 
the productivity of frontier firms in 2011–19. Our 
approach is in line with methodology used by Min 
Zhu, Longmei Zhang, and Daoju Peng, China’s 

82

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivitygrowth potential—A stocktaking and sectoral 
approach, International Monetary Fund, November 
2019. Others calculate country convergence by 
comparing the gap between countries that at 
time t were in the frontier and not in the frontier. 
See Daron Acemoglu, Philippe Aghion, and 
Fabrizio Zilibottu, “Distance to frontier, selection 
and economic growth,” Journal of the European 
Economic Association, volume 4, number 1, March 
2006; and Michael Kremer, Jack Wills and Yang 
You, Converging to convergence, National Bureau 
of Economic Research working paper number 
29484, November 2021. Firms in our sample 
move in and out of the frontier in 2011 versus 2019, 
whereas in the latter methodology, country status 
is fixed across the periods of comparison. If we 
were to fix firm frontier status as per 2011 and 
compare the productivity of those firms with firms 
that were nonfrontier in 2011, we would see a lot 
more convergence across the subsectors. This 
is because many firms that were in the frontier 
in 2011 reduced productivity and were replaced 
by other firms pulling in from outside the frontier. 
However, that fails to illustrate the change in the 
gap of productivity of leaders versus laggards. 
For that, comparison of frontier versus nonfrontier 
productivity is required, as we have done.

19  Note that this split is sensitive to where we draw the 
line. The reallocation effect becomes bigger when 
we aggregate subsectors into sectors, because 
it then captures more of the impact of sector mix. 
The importance of the reallocation effect is in 
line with previous research. According to Chad 
Syverson in “What determines productivity?” 
Journal of Economic Literature, volume 49, number 
2, June 2011, aggregate productivity growth in 
US retail happens mostly through the exit of less 
efficient single-store firms and reallocation to more 
efficient chain store affiliates. For detail, see Lucia 
Foster, John Haltiwanger, and C. J. Krizan, “Market 
selection, reallocation, and restructuring in the 
U.S. retail trade sector in the 1990s,” The Review 
of Economics and Statistics, volume 88, issue 4, 
2006.

20  In our sample, Standouts were, on average, 58 years 
old (since incorporation) and the youngest firm (not 
the result of a merger or spin-off) was 11 years old 
in 2019.

21  Excluding the computer and electronics sector, the 
United States had 1.3 times more Standouts than 
Stragglers, while both Germany and the United 
Kingdom had more Stragglers than Standouts.

22  This analysis differs from examining individual 
subsectors as we did above, because it also 
captures the impact of movement across them. 
We look at our lab economy only and do not know 
the impact of employees leaving or entering firms 
outside the sample.

23  There are good business reasons for productivity 

and profitability growth to move in different 
directions in the short term. One is that companies 

may opt to engage in lower-productivity activities 
because they enhance profits or strengthen 
strategic positioning, even if the impact on the 
productivity of the firm is negative. For instance, 
a shipping company that acquires a trucking 
business might boost its market position and 
resilience but would reduce its average productivity 
level. Consider, too, that firms that invest heavily 
in growth initiatives can experience a temporary 
drag on productivity. Scaling those operations can 
lower productivity in the short term but sets the 
company up for higher productivity over the longer 
run. Outsourcing may also affect productivity levels 
differently, depending on the productivity of the 
functions outsourced.

labor markets in advanced economies, McKinsey 
Global Institute, June 2024; and Dependency and 
depopulation: Confronting the consequences of 
the new demographic reality, McKinsey Global 
Institute, January 2025.

25  We acknowledge the potential risks associated with 
firms that accumulate potential unfair market and 
monopsony power and the longer-term concerns 
around market dominance stifling competition and 
innovation. Approaches to boosting Standouts 
need to be balanced against this.

26  For common descriptions and analyses of superstar 
firms, see ‘Superstars’: The dynamics of firms, 
sectors, and cities leading the global economy, 
McKinsey Global Institute, October 2018, which 
defines superstar firms as the ones with the 
greatest share of economic profit; and David 
Autor et al., “The fall of the labor share and the 
rise of superstar firms,” The Quarterly Journal of 
Economics, volume 135, issue 2, May 2020. Some 
definitions of superstar firms are that they (1) have 
the largest revenue market share or profit pool 
share; (2) achieve the greatest gains in market share 
or marginal improvements in productivity; or (3) 
leverage their size to propel productivity growth, 
driving down marginal costs of expansion and 
gaining even more market share in the process.

CHAPTER ONE

27  For firm-level value added, we use the Orbis 

database, making adjustments where necessary. 
For US firms whose disclosure requirements are 
lower, we estimate employee costs by taking 
sector-level average wages. We make manual 
adjustments using firm financial statements for the 
most relevant firms. GVA is adjusted to constant 
2019 values in local currency with two-sided 
deflators that adjust for changes in input and output 
prices at the sector but not at the firm level. For 
more detail on data preparation, see the technical 
appendix.

28  This research uses total number of employees 
rather than number of hours or only full-time 
employees. We acknowledge that countries, 
sectors, and firms have varying shares of part-

time work; however, this has limited impact on our 
findings because the overall share of part-time 
workers remained relatively stable in this period.

29  Country- and sector-specific deflators used come 

from EU KLEMS.

30  Productivity research recognizes that real GVA, 
calculated by revenue divided by a sector price 
deflator, may not represent true production 
quantities. See, for instance, Lucia Foster, John 
Haltiwanger, and Chad Syverson, “Reallocation, 
firm turnover, and efficiency: Selection on 
productivity or profitability?” American Economic 
Review, volume 98, number 1, March 2008. This is 
because idiosyncratic factors can affect firm-level 
prices and, in turn, affect value added, without 
necessarily being related to quality or productive 
efficiency as captured by a production function. 
Even though so-called revenue-based productivity 
might not be the same as “true” productivity 
calculated using firm-level deflators, both are 
commonly similar. See Dennis O. Kundisch, Neeraj 
Mittal, and Barrie R. Nault, “Research commentary: 
Using income accounting as the theoretical basis 
for measuring IT productivity,” Information Systems 
Research, volume 25, number 3, September 2014.

31  Real value added per worker can also be seen as 
a function of pretax ROIC growth, acceleration 
of asset cycles (in turn, a function of higher 
depreciation rates), increase in capital depth 
per worker (a function of invested capital by 
number of employees), and increase in employee 
compensation.

32  See Cindy Cunningham et al., “Dispersion in 
dispersion: Measuring establishment-level 
differences in productivity,” Review of Income and 
Wealth, volume 69, issue 4, September 2022. The 
authors write that multiple studies in productivity 
dispersion literature have found that high-wage 
establishments are also more productive, and 
that rising between-establishment dispersion in 
wages is closely associated with rising between-
establishment dispersion in productivity. See, 
for instance, Timothy Dunne et al., Wage and 
productivity dispersion in U.S. manufacturing: The 
role of computer investment, National Bureau of 
Economic Research working paper number 7465, 
January 2000.

34  There are good business reasons for productivity 

and profitability growth to move in different 
directions in the short term. One is that companies 
may opt to engage in lower-productivity activities 
because they enhance profits or strengthen 
strategic positioning, even if the impact on the 
productivity of the firm is negative. For instance, 
a shipping company that acquires a trucking 
business might boost its market position and 
resilience but would reduce its average productivity 
level. Consider, too, that firms that invest heavily

functions outsourced.

levels; the significant growth of Big Tech firms in 
these years; a starting year that posed challenges 
to certain subsectors; and the fact that the period 
chosen began shortly after the global financial 
crisis. Firms that performed well on productivity 
during this period may have experienced different 
outcomes later, and vice versa.

35  Contributions result from a sum of two main 
components: a firm productivity effect and a 
reallocation effect. The former is the product of the 
change in a firm’s productivity from 2011 to 2019 
and its average employment share in the same 
period. The latter is the product of the change 
in a firm’s employment share from 2011 to 2019, 
multiplied by the difference between the firm’s 
productivity and average sector productivity 
in the same period. One of the features of this 
approach in comparison with other methods is 
that it allows for shrinking and exiting firms with 
negative productivity growth to generate positive 
sector- and country-level contributions. For more 
detail on the decomposition method adopted, 
see Lucia Foster, John C. Haltiwanger, and C. J. 
Krizan, “Aggregate productivity growth: Lessons 
from microeconomic evidence,” in Charles R. 
Hulten, Edwin R. Dean, and Michael J. Harper, 
eds., New developments in productivity analysis, 
University of Chicago Press, 2001. This approach is 
closely related to the one used in Zvi Griliches and 
Haim Regev, “Firm productivity in Israeli industry 
1979–1988,” Journal of Econometrics, volume 65, 
issue 1, January 1995. This method is designated 
the shift-share method in the World Bank’s Jobs 
Diagnostics JobStructure (JoGGs), too. See Jobs 
diagnostics: Data, tools and guidance, World Bank, 
accessed February 2025. There are several other 
decomposition methodologies. Two other common 
approaches to decompose productivity growth 
into absolute terms were tested as alternatives: a 
Centre for the Study of Living Standards approach 
and what is called a “canonical” approach in J. 
Gaaitzen de Vries, Marcel Timmer, and Klass de 
Vries, “Structural transformation in Africa,” Journal 
of Development Studies, 2015. See the technical 
appendix for key differences between approaches 
and why we chose our method.

36  To minimize the impact of the pandemic on our data, 
we used 2011 to 2019 calendar year reporting where 
possible. For some firms, this means referring to 
financial year 2018 reports that were published in 
2019 rather than using financial year 2019 reports 
that would capture the impact of the pandemic. In 
2011, there were challenges to certain subsectors, 
but our tests showed that inclusion of this time 
frame does not skew our core findings. However, 
the aggregate productivity growth rate during 
this period was lower than in other significant 
historical eras, suggesting that further research 
on periods of rapid growth could yield additional 
insights on productivity drivers. Potential limitations 
introduced by this period include insufficient time 
for transformative technological change and for 
entering firms to achieve mature productivity

Institute, May 2024.

38  This research is intended to stand alone. When the 
availability and quality of data improve, replicating it 
for a more recent period could be a promising area 
of future research.

39  See the technical appendix for more detail on 
methodology used to calculate productivity 
contribution by firm size based on national 
statistics.

40  For more on the importance of young firms and 

innovation to labor productivity, see, for instance, 
Ryan A. Decker et al., “Changing business 
dynamism and productivity: Shocks versus 
responsiveness,” American Economic Review, 
volume 110, number 12, December 2020; John 
Haltiwanger et al., “High growth young firms: 
Contribution to job, output, and productivity 
growth,” in John Haltiwanger et al., eds., Measuring 
entrepreneurial businesses, Studies in Income and 
Wealth, volume 75, National Bureau of Economic 
Research, September 2017; and Daron Acemoglu 
et al., “Innovation, reallocation, and growth,”

November 2018.

and productivity growth: The role of young 
businesses,” Annual Review of Economics, 
volume 7, 2015.

42  Business-to-business companies that interact 

closely with other firms, often larger ones, as part 
of their supply chains have a narrower productivity 
gap with large firms than business-to-consumer 
MSMEs that sell primarily to individuals. On average, 
the gap is 40 percent narrower. See A microscope 
on small businesses: Spotting opportunities to 
boost productivity, McKinsey Global Institute, 
May 2024.

43  Segmenting domestic operations comes with its 
own challenges, notably transfer pricing and data 
limitations.

44  To understand what share of firm revenue is foreign, 
we used more than 250 firms’ annual reports. Data 
on firms’ value added and employment by location 
is very limited, and we therefore use revenue as 
a proxy. For comparison in the United States, 
multinational firms in our focus sectors derived 
20 percent of value added from international 
operations, with some variation by sector and 
country. For instance, computers and electronics 
had 30 percent of value added from foreign 
operations. See Activities of U.S. multinational 
enterprises, 2019, Bureau of Economic Analysis, 

November 12, 2021. See the technical appendix for 
more detail.

45  The number of reported US employees doubled 
from about 45,000 employees in 2011 to about 
90,000 in 2019, according to companies’ publicly 
disclosed information. See, for instance, “Two 
million U.S. jobs. And counting,” Apple, May 2017, 
for the domestic share in 2011, and “Apple’s US job 
footprint grows to 2.4 million,” Apple, August 2019, 
for the domestic share in 2019. The number of full-
time-equivalent employees comes from companies’ 
2011 and 2019 Form 10-K. 

46  National economies’ productivity growth rates 

were calculated using OECD data for value added 
by activity. US Census Bureau and OECD structural 
business statistics by size class and economic 
activity data sets were used to calculate distribution 
of GVA by firm size. EU KLEMS country- and sector-
specific two-sided deflators were used to calculate 
real GVA. Note that we calculate labor productivity 
using value added as output and number of workers 
as input, and therefore results might differ across 
sources (for instance, the US Bureau of Labor 
Statistics considers sector output instead of value 
added, which affects resulting growth rates).

47  Other factors influencing this sector include that 
much of the growth of German discounters in the 
United Kingdom is accounted for in the German 
sample, and German and UK retail sectors miss the 
effect of Amazon and other global e-commerce 
retailers that are not headquartered locally but 
undoubtedly influence productivity dynamics.

CHAPTER TWO

48  It is worth noting that a power-law-type pattern 
of asymmetrical contributions of a few firms, 
sectors, and regions has been found across many 
measures of economic and social progress. For 
industries, see The next big arenas of competition, 
McKinsey Global Institute, October 2024. For 
regions, see Pixels of Progress: A granular look at 
human development around the world, McKinsey 
Global Institute, December 2022. For growth, see 
Outperformers: High-growth emerging economies 
and the companies that propel them, September 
2018; and ‘Superstars’: The dynamics of firms, 
sectors, and cities leading the global economy, 
October 2018.

49  The combined productivity growth of all firms in any 

one geography in our sample.

50  Two percent is approximately the top quartile of 

subsectors’ productivity growth rates.

51  For a detailed discussion of external, sector-level 
factors that can drive within-firm productivity 
differences, see Chad Syverson, “What determines 
productivity?” Journal of Economic Literature, 
volume 49, number 2, June 2011. For detail on 
how contexts with limited technology diffusion 
can undermine aggregate productivity growth, 
see Bernado Mottironi, Labour market power and 

The power of one: How standout firms drive national productivityaggregate productivity, POID Research Seminars, 
November 5, 2014.

52  The sector environment and the presence of 

Standouts and Stragglers also explain why there 
tends to be a small set of “jumping sectors” that 
have the strongest productivity growth. For more, 
see Solving the productivity puzzle: The role of 
demand and the promise of digitization, McKinsey 
Global Institute, February 2018.

53  A microscope on small businesses: Spotting 

opportunities to boost productivity, McKinsey 
Global Institute, May 2024.

54  Non-Standouts account for 22 percent of the 

positive productivity growth in the United States, 
35 percent in Germany, and 55 percent in the 
United Kingdom.

55  Performance for their size is based on a higher 

contribution per employee compared with other 
large firms.

56  Large firms are defined as the top 10 percent of 

firms by number of employees.

57  Frontier firms are defined as being in the 
employment-weighted top quintile of the 
sector. Consistent with previous findings on the 
productivity frontier, frontier firms tend to be 
larger and more global than nonfrontier firms. See 
more in Dan Andrews, Chiara Criscuolo, and Peter 
N. Gal, Frontier firms, technology diffusion and 
public policy, OECD Productivity Working Papers, 
November 2015.

58  According to Lucia Foster et al., Innovation, 
productivity dispersion, and productivity 
growth, National Bureau of Economic Research 
working paper number 24420, September 2018, 
productivity dispersion commonly found in firm-
level productivity literature can reflect multiple 
factors, where “frictions” describe factors that 
the social planner cannot overcome, such as 
adjustment costs that are part of the technology 
of adjustment. “Distortions” describe market 
failures, policies, or institutions that impede firms 
adjusting to their optimal size. See, for instance, 
Chad Syverson, “What determines productivity?” 
Journal of Economic Literature, volume 49, number 
2, June 2011. These factors include idiosyncratic 
productivity shocks, managerial ability and 
practices, product differentiation, frictions, and 
distortions. It is understood that the reallocation 
of resources away from low-productivity to high-
productivity firms reduces this dispersion and 
contributes to productivity growth.

59  See the technical appendix for detail on where 

Standouts and firms that showed 95th percentile 
productivity levels in 2011 or growth between 2011 
and 2019 overlap.

60  For more detail, see John Haltiwanger et al., “High 
growth young firms: Contribution to job, output, 
and productivity growth,” in John Haltiwanger et 
al., eds., Measuring entrepreneurial businesses, 

Studies in Income and Wealth, volume 75, National 
Bureau of Economic Research, September 
2017. Reference to the study is made to help 
illustrate the outsize importance of Standouts 
as a smaller set of firms, identified by a narrower 
threshold, with highest relative contribution to 
aggregate productivity growth. We acknowledge 
that definitions of high-growth firms and output 
generated might not be exactly equivalent to those 
adopted in our analysis.

61  Based on 2012 US Census data on total number 
of firms (SUSB database) and self-employed 
establishments (NES database) in the retail 
sector. See 2012 SUSB annual data tables by 
establishment industry, United States Census 
Bureau, January 2015; and Current employment 
statistics highlights January 2012, Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, February 3, 2012.

62  For common descriptions and analyses of superstar 
firms, see ‘Superstars’: The dynamics of firms, 
sectors, and cities leading the global economy, 
McKinsey Global Institute, October 2018, which 
defines superstar firms as the  
ones with the greatest share of economic profit; and 
David Autor et al., “The fall of the labor share and 
the rise of superstar firms,” The Quarterly Journal 
of Economics, volume 135, issue 2, May 2020. 
Some definitions of superstar firms are that they 
(1) have the largest revenue market share or profit 
pool share; (2) achieve the greatest gains in market 
share or marginal improvements in productivity; or 
(3) leverage their size to propel productivity growth, 
driving down marginal costs of expansion and 
gaining even more market share in the process.

63  We have cross-checked the overlaps between 
Standouts and superstar firms with previous 
MGI reports, namely, ‘Superstars’: The dynamics 
of firms, sectors, and cities leading the global 
economy, McKinsey Global Institute, October 
2018. In this research, superstars were firms in 
the 90th percentile for 2014–16 average nominal 
economic profit (about 700 firms). For comparison 
purposes, we have updated sample firms’ nominal 
economic profit data for 2011 and 2019, which 
resulted in a new set of about 700 superstar firms 
based on 2011–19 average economic profit. Only 
about 70 percent of these firms overlapped with our 
sample. Of these, 30 percent were both superstars 
and Standouts, and 5 percent were both superstars 
and Stragglers.

64  While we use the best available granular sector-
level deflators, it cannot be ruled out that there 
are firm-level price effects that may give unfair 
advantage to large or superstar firms in becoming 
Standouts. Results should be robust to subsector-
level price effects but may still be skewed should an 
individual firm (1) amass a disproportionate share 
of profits in a sector; (2) achieve this via monopoly 
or oligopoly power rather than by offering better 
customer value; and (3) use this power vis-à-vis 
suppliers from the same sector rather than other 

sectors so that price effects average out and do not 
become visible in deflators.

65  This analysis is not as in-depth as in the 2011–19 
period due to the very small sample and data 
limitations. It is meant to be an illustrative exercise 
of how specific firms can change trajectory. Our 
2019–23 analysis compiles data from a variety of 
sources, including McKinsey Value Intelligence, 
S&P Global Market Intelligence, national statistics 
databases, IHS Markit, OECD, and the International 
Labour Organization. The subset of 114 firms 
was selected based on data availability for the 
2019–23 period and consistency of data quality 
when compared with the 2011–19 database. A 
manual review of firms was conducted where firms 
showing variation from the 2019–23 data set to 
the 2011–19 database were validated and updated 
where required using published financial statement 
data. Country- and sector-level productivity growth 
from 2019 to 2023 was calculated using publicly 
available date from national statistics for deflators, 
wage data, and real GVA. We acknowledge that our 
sample does not analyze the full population of top 
Standouts and Stragglers. However, we note that 
by analyzing the subset of firms for which data is 
consistent across both periods, and using the same 
source of data for 2019 and 2023, we are confident 
that our findings are sufficiently robust to compare 
productivity performance over both periods.

134  Manual adjustments were made to Orbis data 
to ensure that entries and exits of companies 
in the time frame of our analysis were correctly 
accounted for according to companies’ reports and 
to the best of our knowledge. See the technical 
appendix for detail on the data preparation 
process.

135  Pathways are calculated by defining whether a 
firm is at or short of the frontier at the subsector 
level. A firm is defined as in the frontier if it is in the 
top 20th percentile of employment among firms 
ranked by productivity per employee. A firm that is 
in the frontier within its subsector may be outside 
the frontier in sector-level analysis of previous 
chapters. For example, in 2011, Southwest Airlines 
was in the frontier in the US travel and logistics 
sector but was outside the frontier in the US  
travel subsector.

136  We assessed convergence by looking at how the 
productivity of nonfrontier firms grew relative to 
the productivity of frontier firms in 2011–19. Our 
approach is in line with methodology used by Min 
Zhu, Longmei Zhang, and Daoju Peng, China’s 
growth potential—A stocktaking and sectoral 
approach, International Monetary Fund, November 
2019. Others calculate country convergence by 
comparing the gap between countries that at 
time t were in the frontier and not in the frontier. 
See Daron Acemoglu, Philippe Aghion, and 
Fabrizio Zilibottu, “Distance to frontier, selection 
and economic growth,” Journal of the European 
Economic Association, volume 4, number 1, March 
2006; and Michael Kremer, Jack Wills, and Yang 
You, Converging to convergence, National Bureau 
of Economic Research working paper number 
29484, November 2021. Firms in our sample 
move in and out of the frontier in 2011 versus 2019, 
whereas in the latter methodology, country status 
is fixed across the periods of comparison. If we 
were to fix firm frontier status as per 2011 and 
compare the productivity of those firms with firms 
that were nonfrontier in 2011, we would see a lot 
more convergence across the subsectors. This 
is because many firms that were in the frontier in 
2011 reduced productivity and were replaced by 

other firms pulling in from outside the frontier. We 
chose to focus on the growing gap between the 
group of leaders and laggards rather than following 
individual firms.

137  The case of Nvidia exemplifies what typically 

occurs in high-growth diverging subsectors. Other 
firms are not able to replicate the advantages of a 
frontier firm, perhaps because they are resource 
constrained or have a different strategic focus. 
For more, see Dan Andrews, Chiara Criscuolo, and 
Peter N. Gal, The best versus the rest: The global 
productivity slowdown, divergence across firms 
and the role of public policy, OECD Productivity 
Working Papers number 05, November 2016; 
and Prasanna Tambe et al., Digital capital and 
superstar firms, National Bureau of Economic 
Research working paper number 28285, 
December 2020. Divergence has been associated 
with rising inequality among firms, which could 
discourage the majority of firms from innovating 
and investing. Such divergence could, it has been 
argued, accelerate where winner-takes-most 
dynamics are present, for example when digital 
technologies are diffusing.

138  See, for instance, J. David Brown and John S. Earle, 
Understanding the contributions of reallocation to 
productivity growth: Lessons from a comparative 
firm-level analysis, IZA Institute of Labor 
Economics discussion paper 3683, September 
2008; and Lucia Foster, Cheryl Grim, and John 
Haltiwanger, “Reallocation in the Great Recession: 
Cleansing or not?” Journal of Labor Economics, 
volume 34, number S1, Part 2, January 2016.

139  Note that the reallocation effect here is calculated 
at the sector level. It therefore includes the impact 
of subsector mix shifts but not the impact of any 
sector mix shift. It also includes the impact of 
employees entering or exiting our sample only 
to the extent that they affect within-sector firm 
employment shares.

140  Note this split is sensitive to where we draw the 

line. The reallocation effect gets bigger when we 
aggregate subsectors into sectors because it then 
captures more of the impact of sector mix.

141  This is in line with previous research. According to 
Chad Syverson, “What determines productivity?” 
Journal of Economic Literature, volume 49, number 
2, June 2011, aggregate productivity growth in 
US retail happens mostly through the exit of less 
efficient single-store firms and reallocation to 
more efficient chain store affiliates. For detail, see 
Lucia Foster, John Haltiwanger, and C.J. Krizan, 
“Market selection, reallocation, and restructuring 
in the U.S. retail trade sector in the 1990s,” The

143  We note that a firm newly entering our sample 

often was one that had been established for, say, 
ten years, but had only just become large enough 
to employ 50 or more people and therefore fit 
our criteria.

CHAPTER FIVE

144  See for example, A new look at the declining labor 
share of income in the United States, McKinsey 
Global Institute, May 2019.

145  To estimate a Standout’s contribution to the entire 
economy, we multiplied its productivity impact 
on a sector by the sector’s share of total national 
employment. We then expressed this contribution 

in basis points by normalizing it against the total 
change in national productivity and multiplying 
by the country’s productivity growth rate. To 
calculate productivity growth rates for total private 
economies, we used data from the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis for the United States, National 
Accounts Aggregates by Industry from Eurostat for 
Germany, and Office for National Statistics for the 
United Kingdom. 

146  This calculation involves rounding.

labor markets in advanced economies, McKinsey 
Global Institute, June 2024; and Dependency and 
depopulation: Confronting the consequences of 
the new demographic reality, McKinsey Global 
Institute, January 2025.

148  We acknowledge the potential risks associated 

with firms that accumulate potential unfair market 
and monopsony power and the longer-term 
concerns around market dominance stifling 
competition and innovation. Approaches to 
boosting Standouts need to be balanced  
against this.

149  For common descriptions and analyses of 

superstar firms, see ‘Superstars’: The dynamics 
of firms, sectors, and cities leading the global 
economy, McKinsey Global Institute, October 
2018; and David Autor et al., “The fall of the 
labor share and the rise of superstar firms,” The 
Quarterly Journal of Economics, volume 135, issue 
2, May 2020. These are typically firms (1) with the 
largest revenue market share or profit pool share; 

(2) with the greatest gains in market share or 
marginal improvements in productivity; or (3) that 
leverage their size to propel productivity growth, 
driving down marginal costs of expansion and 
gaining even more market share in the process.

150  For common descriptions and analyses of 

superstar firms, see ‘Superstars’: The dynamics 
of firms, sectors, and cities leading the global

with the greatest share of economic profit; and

the rise of superstar firms,” The Quarterly Journal 
of Economics, volume 135, issue 2, May 2020. 
Some definitions of superstar firms are that they 
(1) have the largest revenue market share or profit 
pool share; (2) achieve the greatest gains in market 
share or marginal improvements in productivity; or 
(3) leverage their size to propel productivity growth, 
driving down marginal costs of expansion and 
gaining even more market share in the process.
