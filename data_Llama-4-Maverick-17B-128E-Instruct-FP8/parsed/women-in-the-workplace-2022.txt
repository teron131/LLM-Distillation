2  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: ABOUT THE STUDY

About the study

Women in the Workplace is the largest study on the state of women in 
corporate America.1 In 2015, LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Company 
launched the study to give companies insights and tools to advance 
gender diversity in the workplace. Between 2015 and 2022, over 810 
companies participated in the study, and more than 400,000 people 
were surveyed on their workplace experiences. This year, we collected 
information from 333 participating organizations employing more than 12 
million people, surveyed more than 40,000 employees, and conducted 
interviews with women of diverse identities, including women of color, 
LGBTQ+ women, and women with disabilities.2 Our 2022 report focuses 
on how the pandemic has changed what women want from their 
companies, including the growing importance of opportunity, ﬂexibility, 
employee well-being, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.

We’re in the midst of a “Great Breakup”

INTRODUCTION

There are always winners and losers in the war for talent, and the stakes are higher than ever 
for companies that want to achieve gender equality. 

Women are demanding more from work, and they’re leaving their companies in unprecedented 
numbers to get it. Women leaders are switching jobs at the highest rate we’ve ever seen—and 
at a higher rate than men in leadership.3 This could have serious implications for companies. 
Women are already signiﬁcantly underrepresented in leadership. For years, fewer women have 
risen through the ranks because of the “broken rung” at the ﬁrst step up to manager.4 Now, 
companies are struggling to hold on to the relatively few women leaders they have. And all of 
these dynamics are even more pronounced for women of color. 

The reasons women leaders are stepping away from their companies are telling. Women 
leaders are just as ambitious as men, but at many companies they face headwinds that make 
it harder to advance.5 They’re more likely to experience belittling microaggressions, such as 
having their judgment questioned or being mistaken for someone more junior. They’re doing 
more to support employee well-being and foster inclusion, but this critical work is spreading 
them thin and going mostly unrewarded. And ﬁnally, it’s increasingly important to women 
leaders that they work for companies that prioritize ﬂexibility, employee well-being, and 
diversity, equity, and inclusion. 

If companies don’t take action, they won’t just lose their women leaders; they risk losing the 
next generation of women leaders, too. Young women are even more ambitious, and they place 
a higher premium on working in an equitable, supportive, and inclusive workplace.6 They’re 
watching senior women leave for better opportunities, and they’re prepared to do the same.

PART 1

The state of 
the pipeline

7  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: PIPELINE

Two pipeline challenges 
put gender equality out of 
reach for most companies

Despite modest gains in representation over the last eight 
years, women—and especially women of color—are still 
dramatically underrepresented in corporate America. And 
this is especially true in senior leadership: only 1 in 4 C-suite 
leaders is a woman, and only 1 in 20 is a woman of color. 
Moreover, most companies are grappling with two pipeline 
problems that make achieving gender equality in their 
organization all but impossible:

The “broken rung” remains broken. For the eighth 
consecutive year, a “broken rung” at the ﬁrst step up to 
manager is holding women back. For every 100 men who are 
promoted from entry level to manager, only 87 women are 
promoted, and only 82 women of color are promoted. As a 
result, men signiﬁcantly outnumber women at the manager 
level, and women can never catch up. There are simply too 
few women to promote into senior leadership positions.7

More women leaders are leaving their companies. Now 
companies have a new pipeline problem. Women leaders 
are leaving their companies at the highest rate in years, and 
the gap between women and men leaders leaving is the 
largest we’ve ever seen. To put the scale of the problem in 
perspective: for every woman at the director level who gets 
promoted to the next level, two women directors are 
choosing to leave their company.

Many women are switching jobs for better 
opportunities, but some are considering 
downshifting and leaving the workforce. 
In the past year, 29% of women—and 22% of 
men—have thought about reducing their 
hours, taking a less demanding job, or 
leaving the workforce altogether, although 
far fewer have actually taken these actions.

“When I joined this company, I noticed there were a lot 

of women and people of color in leadership. That let 
me know it was possible for me to advance. When you 
come into a company and there are leaders who look 
like you, it just feels diﬀerent.”

The “broken rung” is still 
holding women back

The biggest obstacle women face on the path to senior leadership 
is at the ﬁrst step up to manager. For every 100 men promoted from 
entry level to manager, only 87 women are promoted, and only 82 
women of color are promoted.9 As a result, men signiﬁcantly 
outnumber women at the manager level, and women can never 
catch up. There are simply too few women to promote into senior 
leadership positions.

Some groups of women are even less likely to 
be promoted to manager. For every 100 men 
promoted from entry level to manager, only 75 
Latinas are promoted—and this number is even 
lower for Native Hawaiian, Paciﬁc Islander, and 
Indigenous women.

A CLOSER LOOK

Women remain deeply 
underrepresented in 
technical roles

Women are far less likely than men to work in engineering and 
technical ﬁelds, and women’s relative representation in these jobs 
is lower than it was in 2018.12 As a result, women in technical roles 
are twice as likely as women overall to say they are frequently the 
only woman in the room at work. The fact that they are so often 
“Only” women may partly explain why women in tech face higher 
rates of bias: they are more likely than women in non-technical 
roles to have their judgment questioned in their area of expertise 
and to say their gender has played a role in their being passed 
over for a chance to get ahead. 

These trends have troubling implications for gender equality. 
Engineering and technical roles are among corporate America’s 
fastest-growing and highest-paid job categories.13 If women in 
these roles have negative day-to-day experiences and don’t see 
an equal path to advancement, it could lead to larger gaps in both 
representation and earnings between women and men overall.

“The engineering ﬁeld is almost all 

men, and it has been for a long 
time. When I was at university, there 
were just ﬁve women in a room of 
sixty men. And when I started 
working, it was like that too. So it’s
a very challenging environment.”

Why women 
leaders are 
switching jobs

13  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: WOMEN LEADERS

Women leaders are 
leaving their companies 
for three key reasons

Women leaders are demanding more from their companies, 
and they’re increasingly willing to switch jobs to get it. 
Three primary factors are driving their decisions to leave:

Women leaders want to advance, but they face stronger 
headwinds than men. Women leaders are as likely as 
men at their level to want to be promoted and aspire to 
senior-level roles. In many companies, however, they 
experience microaggressions that undermine their 
authority and signal that it will be harder for them to 
advance. For example, they are far more likely than men 
leaders to have colleagues question their judgment or 
imply that they aren’t qualiﬁed for their jobs. Women 
leaders are also more likely to report that personal 
characteristics, such as their gender or being a parent, 
have played a role in them being denied or passed over 
for a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. 

Women leaders are 2x as likely as 
men leaders to be mistaken for 
someone more junior.

37% of women leaders have had a 
coworker get credit for their idea, 
compared to 27% of men leaders.

“I’ve asked many times what I can do to 

get promoted, and I don’t get a good 
answer. I’m thinking of leaving. And it will 
be my company’s loss since they didn’t 
oﬀer me the opportunity to advance. I hit 
a ceiling that didn’t need to be there.”

SOUTH ASIAN WOMAN, SENIOR MANAGER, 
IMMIGRANT

14  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: WOMEN LEADERS

Women leaders are overworked and under-recognized. 
Compared to men at their level, women leaders do more to 
support employee well-being and foster diversity, equity, and 
inclusion—work that dramatically improves retention and 
employee satisfaction, but is not formally rewarded in most 
companies.14 Spending time and energy on work that isn’t 
recognized could make it harder for women leaders to 
advance. It also means that women leaders are stretched 
thinner than men in leadership; not surprisingly, women leaders 
are far more likely than men at their level to be burned out.

Women leaders are 2x as likely 
as men leaders to spend 
substantial time on DEI work.15

40% of women leaders say their 
DEI work isn’t acknowledged at 
all in performance reviews.16

43% of women leaders are 
burned out, compared to only 
31% of men at their level.

“

Burnout from management responsibilities 
and unsustainable workload has made me 
more ambitious, but not in the same way. 
I’m more ambitious about going after 
something diﬀerent. I’m more ambitious 
about making a career change or going 
after something where I feel more fulﬁlled.” 

WHITE WOMAN, SENIOR MANAGER

15  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: WOMEN LEADERS

Women leaders want a better work culture. Women leaders 
are signiﬁcantly more likely than men leaders to leave their 
jobs because they want more ﬂexibility or because they want 
to work for a company that is more committed to employee 
well-being and diversity, equity, and inclusion.17 And over the 
last two years, these factors have only become more 
meaningful to women leaders.18

If companies don’t take action in response to these trends, 
they’re at risk of losing more women leaders. That could 
have serious implications. Compared to men at the same 
level, women leaders are investing more time and energy 
in eﬀective people management, allyship, and DEI.19 They 
are leading the transition to a more supportive, inclusive 
workplace, which is what the next generation of employees

—and especially younger women—want and expect.   “

49% of women leaders say ﬂexibility is one 
of the top three things they consider when 
deciding whether to join or stay with a 
company, compared to 34% of men leaders.

Women leaders are more than 1.5x as likely 
as men at their level to have left a previous 
job because they wanted to work for a 
company that was more committed to DEI.

I think people have come through the 
pandemic feeling a bit more empowered. 
We’ve realized that being in a toxic 
environment where you’re not happy 
is just not worth it.”

BLACK WOMAN, VICE PRESIDENT

16  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: WOMEN LEADERS

Companies are also at risk 
of losing young women

The factors that drive women leaders to leave their companies are 
even more important to young women. Young women care deeply 
about opportunity to advance—more than two-thirds of women under 
30 want to be senior leaders, and well over half say advancement has 
become more important to them in the past two years.20 Young 
women are also more likely than women leaders to say they’re 
increasingly prioritizing ﬂexibility and company commitment to 
well-being and DEI. Companies that don’t take action may struggle 
to recruit and retain the next generation of women leaders—and for 
companies that already have a “broken rung” in their leadership 
pipeline, this has especially worrisome implications. 

Young women play a critical role in building diverse 
and inclusive teams. They are more likely than older 
women to be women of color and identify as LGBTQ+.21 
They are also more likely than both older employees 
and men in their age group to actively practice allyship 
at work.

Two-thirds of women under 30 say they would be 
more interested in advancing if they saw senior 
leaders with the work-life balance they want.

Black women leaders are more 
ambitious but face greater barriers 
to advancement

Black women leaders are more ambitious than other women at 
their level: 59 percent of Black women leaders want to be top 
executives, compared to 49 percent of women leaders overall. 
But they are also more likely than women leaders of other 
races and ethnicities to receive signals that it will be harder for 
them to advance. Compared to other women at their level, 
Black women leaders are more likely to have colleagues 
question their competence and to be subjected to demeaning 
behavior—and 1 in 3 Black women leaders says they’ve been 
denied or passed over for opportunities because of personal 
characteristics, including their race and gender.24

Women at all levels are far more likely than men to be 
responsible for most or all of their family’s housework 
and caregiving. But the imbalance is especially stark 
between men and women in leadership roles. Among 
entry-level employees, women are about twice as likely 
as men to be doing all of this work; among employees 
in leadership, the gap nearly doubles.

I know that most men in the C-suite have a

An intersectional 
look at women’s 
experiences

20  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: INTERSECTIONAL LOOK

Some women face 
more bias and receive 
less support at work

Many women experience bias not only because of their 
gender, but also because of their race, sexual orientation, 
a disability, or other aspects of their identity—and the 
compounded discrimination can be much greater than the 
sum of its parts. As a result, these groups of women often 
experience more microaggressions and face more barriers 
to advancement. It’s critical that companies and coworkers 
are aware of these dynamics so they can more eﬀectively 
promote equity and inclusion for all women. 

“As I was progressing through my career, people kept telling 

me I needed to have ‘executive presence.’ And what they 
really meant was I needed to look the part. I needed to have 
the right clothing, I needed to look feminine enough. That 
was always a challenge for me, because I didn't follow the 
typical feminine dress code.”

WHITE WOMAN, SENIOR MANAGER, LESBIAN

21  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: INTERSECTIONAL LOOK

Although no study can fully capture the experiences of women with traditionally 
marginalized identities, this year’s ﬁndings point to these distinct experiences:

Women of color are more ambitious despite getting 
less support. Forty-one percent of women of color 
want to be top executives, compared to 27 percent of 
white women.

Latinas and Black women are less likely than women 
of other races and ethnicities to say their manager 
shows interest in their career development. They also 
tend to feel less psychological safety26—for example, 
less than half of Latinas and Black women say people 
on their team aren’t penalized for mistakes.

Asian women and Black women are less likely to 
have strong allies on their teams.27 They are also less 
likely than white women to say senior colleagues have 
taken important sponsorship actions on their behalf, 
such as publicly praising their skills or advocating for 
a compensation increase for them.

Women with disabilities often have their competence 
challenged and undermined. They are signiﬁcantly 
more likely than other groups of women to have their 
judgment questioned in their area of expertise and to 
have colleagues get credit for their ideas.  

LGBTQ+ women and women with disabilities are 
more likely to experience demeaning and “othering” 
microaggressions.28 Compared to women overall, they 
are more likely to have colleagues comment on their 
appearance or tell them that they “look mad” or 
“should smile more.”

Latinas and Asian women are more likely than 
women of other races and ethnicities to have 
colleagues comment on their culture or nationality—
for example, by asking where they’re “really from.”

These are only some of the many groups of women who often have worse experiences at work due to intersecting and compounding biases. We surveyed 
women with a wide range of other traditionally marginalized identities—including Indigenous women, Middle Eastern women, mixed-race women, and 
transgender women, to name just a few—as well as women with multiple intersecting identities. However, due to small sample sizes, we are only able to 
report on ﬁndings for the following groups: Asian women, Black women, Latinas, all women of color, all LGBTQ+ women, and all women with disabilities.

IN THEIR WORDS

“

Someone I work with went behind my back and told 
my VP that I was having personal conversations in 
Spanish on the clock. They said I wasn’t working. 
That simply wasn’t true. I was speaking Spanish on 
the job because I manage an entire region that is 
Spanish-speaking. I was so demoralized. I thought, 
‘Why even go to work if I’m going to be bullied and 
harassed about the language I’m speaking?’”

LATINA, MANAGER, PHYSICAL DISABILITY

There have been times when I’ve been excluded 
from a work-related conversation just because

The importance 
of ﬂexible and 
remote work

25  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: FLEXIBILITY

Remote and hybrid work 
are game-changing 
for women

Two years after the pandemic forced corporate America 
into a massive experiment with ﬂexible work, enthusiasm 
for ﬂexibility in all its forms is higher than ever. A vast 
majority of employees want to work for companies that 
oﬀer remote or hybrid work options. Only 7 percent of 
companies plan to pull back on remote and hybrid work 
in the next year, and 32 percent say these options are 
likely to expand.

Although remote and hybrid won’t work for all companies 
or all roles, it’s clear that these new modes of working 
are here to stay. As companies continue to navigate this 
transition, there are three key things they should keep 
in mind:

Choice is critical. Employees who can choose to work 
in the arrangement they prefer—whether remote or 
on-site—are less burned out, happier in their jobs, and 
much less likely to consider leaving their companies. 
This points to the importance of giving employees 
agency and choice when possible; a one-size-ﬁts-all 
approach to ﬂexible work won’t work for all employees.

“

I think working remotely has made it easier to deal 
with bias and disrespect. After a meeting, I can go 
sit outside for a few minutes and take deep 
breaths. I can turn oﬀ my camera and cry. Working 
remotely has really improved my mental health.” 

WHITE WOMAN, MANAGER, LESBIAN, REMOTE WORKER

Women who work in a diﬀerent arrangement 
from their teammates may get less support. 
Women who work remotely signiﬁcantly more often 
than their colleagues—or on-site signiﬁcantly more 
than their colleagues—are less likely to report that 
their manager supports their well-being and shows 
interest in their career.

26  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: FLEXIBILITY

The option to work remotely is especially important 
to women. Only 1 in 10 women wants to work35 mostly 
on-site, and many women point to remote and hybrid 
work options as one of their top reasons for joining or 
staying with an organization.36 These preferences are 
about more than ﬂexibility. When women work remotely 
at least some of the time, they experience fewer 
microaggressions and higher levels of psychological 
safety.37 The decrease in microaggressions is 
especially pronounced for women of color, LGBTQ+ 
women, and women with disabilities—groups who 
typically face more demeaning and othering behavior.

Although remote and hybrid work are delivering real 
beneﬁts, they may also be creating new challenges. 
Most employees prefer working remotely at least some 
of the time. And most HR leaders say that oﬀering 
ﬂexible work options has helped diversify their talent 
pipelines and retain more employees from 
underrepresented groups. However, there are potential 
downsides to these new ways of working. A majority of 
companies are concerned that employees who work 
remotely feel less connected to their teams and say 
that remote and hybrid work are placing additional 
demands on managers. It’s also possible that 
employees who primarily work from home—who are 
more likely to be women—will get fewer opportunities 
for recognition and advancement.38

71% of HR leaders say remote work has 
helped their organization hire and retain more 
employees from diverse backgrounds. 

Remote and hybrid work can oﬀer a reprieve 
from bias, but it’s not a substitute for systemic 
change. On one hand, it’s positive that women 
are experiencing fewer microaggressions when 
they work remotely. On the other hand, it’s 
deeply problematic. Regardless of where they 
work, all women deserve to feel valued and 
included. Companies cannot rely on remote 
and hybrid work as a solution; they need to 
invest in creating a truly inclusive culture.

A CLOSER LOOK

Remote work options are especially 
critical for women with disabilities

The shift toward remote and hybrid work has been particularly beneﬁcial for women with 
disabilities. Working at home can help women with disabilities be healthier and more 
productive, since it’s easier to manage mobility issues, chronic pain, and mental health 
conditions when you have more control over your work environment.

Women with disabilities also feel more respected and supported when they have the option to 
work remotely. They are less likely to experience certain microaggressions, such as hearing 
negative comments about their appearance or having colleagues openly question their 
qualiﬁcations. They are also more likely to say their manager trusts them to get their work 
done and that they feel comfortable talking openly with colleagues about their challenges.

“

I don’t think I could work full-time if I was 
required to be in the oﬃce. I think it is literally 
that life-changing to be remote for me.”

Five steps companies can 
take to navigate the shift to 
remote and hybrid work

For companies that are transitioning to remote and hybrid 
work, it’s critical to ensure that these new modes of working 
work for everyone. This will require a mindset shift. It’s not 
enough to tweak old policies and practices; companies 
need to fundamentally rethink how work is done. To start, 
companies would be well served to focus their eﬀorts in ﬁve 
general areas:

1

Clearly communicate plans 
and guidelines for ﬂexible work

As remote and hybrid work policies continue to 
evolve, companies should take extra care to ensure 
that employees know what to expect and understand 
the rationale behind decisions. It’s important to share 
guidelines about who can work remotely and why, so 
people don’t feel they’re being treated unfairly. It’s also 
important that companies provide clear guidelines to 
help employees navigate the day-to-day complexities 
of remote and hybrid work; for example, establishing 
speciﬁc windows during which meetings can be 
scheduled and employees in diﬀerent time zones 
are expected to be available.

“I’ve found that remote work is really, 

really role based. Sometimes we 
do need to be in a team working 
environment for a project. But other 
than that, if someone can work better 
and feel more comfortable by working 
remotely, then why not?”

EAST ASIAN WOMAN, MANAGER, HYBRID 
WORKER

32  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: FLEXIBILITY

Gather regular feedback from employees

2

It’s hard to navigate any major transition without 
understanding employees’ priorities and experiences. 
But only about half of companies have surveyed 
employees on their preferences for remote and hybrid 
work over the past year—which means they may not 
fully understand how policies are impacting diﬀerent 
groups or how changes have been received. And as 
companies roll out new remote and hybrid work norms, 
they will want to keep a regular pulse on what’s working 
for employees and what needs to be improved.

3

Invest in fostering 
employee connectedness

This means being intentional about working norms—
for example, having everyone join meetings via 
videoconference so it’s easier for employees to 
participate when they are working remotely. It also 
means ﬁnding new ways to foster camaraderie and 
connection. Making creative use of technology to 
facilitate watercooler-style interactions and team 
celebrations in a virtual work environment is a good 
start. Companies could also beneﬁt from dedicating 
resources to team bonding events and, whether 
they’re virtual or in person, taking special care to 
make sure that all employees feel included and that 
events are accessible to everyone.

Be purposeful about in-person work

4

Employee expectations for in-person work are 
changing—in particular, many employees don’t want 
to come into the oﬃce to do work they can just as 
easily do at home. In light of this, many companies 
are starting to refocus in-person work on activities 
that take advantage of being together, such as 
high-level planning, learning and development 
training, and bursts of heavy collaboration.

“I have one report who has a toddler. 

She also has essential on-site tasks. 
So we aligned on the activities that she 
absolutely has to do on-site, and she 
only has to be there for those. For a few 
months when the daycares were closed, 
we assigned somebody else to do her 
on-site tasks temporarily, so she could 
stay at home with her kids. It didn’t 
aﬀect her performance whatsoever, 
or her aspirations in the company. It 
didn’t change my perception of her.”

LATINA, MANAGER, HYBRID WORKER, IMMIGRANT

33  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: FLEXIBILITY

Make sure the playing ﬁeld is level

5

It’s important that remote and hybrid employees get the 
same support and opportunities as on-site employees. 
People managers play a central role here, and many could 
beneﬁt from additional training on how to foster remote and 
hybrid employees’ career development and minimize 
ﬂexibility stigma. Equal access to mentorship and 
sponsorship are also key, yet less than half of companies 
oﬀer virtual mentorship and sponsorship programs. Finally, 
companies can put safeguards in place to make sure 
employees who take advantage of remote and hybrid work 
options aren’t disadvantaged in performance reviews. This 
means communicating to managers that employees should 
be evaluated based on measurable results—not when or 
where they work—and closely tracking performance ratings 
and promotions for remote, hybrid, and on-site employees. 
If they see discrepancies, companies should revisit their 
manager training, career development, and evaluation 
practices to make sure remote and hybrid employees are 
not being unfairly penalized.

Flexibility stigma is the unfair 
judgment that employees often 
face when they work ﬂexible hours 
or work from home. Research 
shows that employees who work 
ﬂexibly face more doubts about 
their productivity and commitment, 
even when they produce the same 
results as their colleagues.42

CASE STUDY

How Blue Shield of California made a 
successful shift to hybrid work

What Blue Shield of California did

Over the past two years, Blue Shield of California has made an intentional transition to hybrid work, with a 
particular focus on balancing employee preferences with delivering on business goals. Their approach 
included four key steps:

1. Allow remote work wherever possible. During the early stages of the pandemic, Blue Shield of 

California realized that many of their roles could be remote. Most employees now have the choice to 
work remotely at least some of the time, with only essential workers such as clinical staﬀ fully on-site.

2. Trained managers. More than 90 percent of Blue Shield of California’s managers completed training 

on how to manage hybrid teams. The training included live online workshops and toolkits on topics 
like supporting employee well-being and ensuring that both remote and on-site team members are 
included and treated fairly. Following the training, 95 percent of participants said they felt ready to 
lead in a hybrid work environment.

3. Make in-person work purposeful. Blue Shield of California aligned on four types of work that are best 

done in person: governance and planning, collaboration, connection, and learning and development.

4. Fostered healthy workloads. Blue Shield of California asked managers to work with their employees 
one-on-one to create schedules that balance work and life. To protect employees’ personal time, the 
company also has a policy of no meetings before 9 a.m., between 12 and 1 p.m., and after 5 p.m.

What impact did Blue Shield of California’s programs have?

In recent employee surveys, 90 percent of employees said the company is a great place to work, and 95 
percent of women said they felt fairly treated. In addition, Blue Shield of California appeared on Fortune’s 
100 Best Companies to Work For list in 2022, a ﬁrst in the company’s history.

PART 5

The importance 
of managers

37  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: MANAGERS

Managers are key 
to retaining 
women—but they 
need more support 
to get this right

Managers play an essential role in shaping women’s—and 
all employees’—work experiences.43 When managers invest 
in people management and DEI, women are happier and 
less burned out. They’re also less likely to think about 
leaving their jobs and more likely to recommend their 
company as a good place to work—which translates to 
higher retention and better recruiting.

The problem is there’s a growing gap between what’s 
expected of managers and how they’re being trained and 
rewarded. Most companies say managers have been 
expected to do more over the last two years to support 
employees’ well-being and advancement and promote 
inclusion on their teams. At the same time, the shift to 
remote and hybrid work has made managers’ jobs more 
challenging. Yet relatively few companies are adequately 
training managers to meet these new demands, and even 
fewer recognize people management and DEI eﬀorts in 
managers’ performance reviews. Companies are eﬀectively 
treating this work as a nice-to-have—as opposed to a core 
part of a manager’s job—and this disconnect is apparent in 
the way managers are showing up. Only about half of 
women say their manager regularly encourages respectful 
behavior on their team, and less than half say their 
manager shows interest in their career and helps them 
manage their workload.

Having a manager who cares about their 
well-being really matters to women—it’s one 
of the top three factors they consider when 
deciding whether to join or stay with a company.

Better performance evaluations can especially 
beneﬁt women managers. Women managers 
tend to invest more in people management 
and DEI. For example, employees with women 
managers are more likely to say their manager 
checks in on their well-being, helps them manage 
their workload, and promotes inclusive behavior 
on their team. When this work is included in 
performance reviews, women managers are more 
likely to be recognized for their eﬀorts—which 
could lead to higher performance ratings, faster 
advancement, and higher pay.

How companies can equip, incentivize, 
and reward good managers

To begin to close the gap between what’s expected of managers and how 
they show up, companies could beneﬁt from focusing on two key objectives:

Set managers up for success

1

Although a majority of companies provide general training 
for managers, far fewer address speciﬁcs that are critical to 
managing teams today, such as how to minimize burnout 
and ensure promotions are equitable. Research shows 
that when training focuses on concrete topics like these, it 
leads to better results.44 Companies could also beneﬁt from 
stepping back to make sure people managers have the time 
and resources they need to do their jobs well. Managers 
have seen their scope of work expand dramatically over the 
past two years, and, understandably, many are struggling 
with the added responsibilities.

40% of people managers are 
burned out, compared to only 
31% of individual contributors.

40  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: MANAGERS

2

Hold managers accountable 
and reward those who excel

While virtually all companies build business goals into 
managers’ performance reviews, very few do the same 
for metrics related to people management and DEI. This is 
an incomplete view of performance, but it's relatively easy 
to ﬁx. It’s increasingly common for employees to review 
their manager’s performance, and prompts to gather more 
expansive input can be added to employee evaluation 
forms.45 Many companies track attrition rates, promotion 
rates, and other career outcomes and conduct surveys 
to measure employee satisfaction and well-being; insights 
from these processes can be built into managers’ 
performance evaluations.

In addition, companies can take steps to more clearly 
signal their expectations and reward results, such as 
sharing well-being and diversity metrics with all employees 
and publicly acknowledging managers who stand out for 
their eﬀorts to support employees and foster inclusion on 
their teams.

Managers may need more training 
on how to ensure workloads are 
manageable. More than 70% of 
companies instruct managers to help 
employees manage their workloads, 
but only 38% of employees say their 
manager does this consistently. This 
really matters: more than half of 
women say ensuring a manageable 
workload is one of the most important 
things their company can do to signal 
commitment to employee well-being, 
and women leaders are especially 
likely to say this.

Recommendations 
for companies

44  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: RECOMMENDATIONS

A road map to 
gender equality

To make meaningful and sustainable progress toward 
gender equality, companies should focus on two 
broad goals: getting more women into leadership and 
retaining the women leaders they already have. This will 
require pushing beyond common practices. Companies 
that have better representation of women, especially 
women of color, are going further. They’re doubling 
down on setting goals, tracking outcomes, and holding 
leaders accountable—the building blocks of driving 
organizational change. They’re oﬀering more speciﬁc 
and actionable training so managers are better 
equipped to support their teams and employees know 
how to practice allyship. They’re creating dedicated 
programs to make sure women get the mentorship 
and sponsorship they deserve. And they’re oﬀering a 
constellation of beneﬁts to improve women’s day-to-day 
work experiences: ﬂexibility, emergency childcare 
beneﬁts, and mental health supports. Companies that 
want to see better results would beneﬁt from following 
their lead and breaking new ground.

Most companies also need to take speciﬁc, highly 
targeted steps to ﬁx their “broken rung.” This starts with 
identifying where the largest gap in promotions is for 
women in their pipeline—for a majority of companies, 
this will be at the ﬁrst step up to manager, but it could 
be at higher levels, too. Then companies need to make 
sure women and men are put up for promotions at 
similar rates, monitor outcomes to make sure they’re 
equitable, and root out biased aspects of their 
evaluation process.

An overview of the policies and 
programs that drive progress

Based on an analysis of HR and DEI best practices, we have identiﬁed three 
distinct categories of policies and programs for advancing and retaining women:51

● Table stakes have been adopted by more than 75 percent of companies—
and while important, they’re not driving enough progress on their own.

● Leading practices are less common than table stakes—and more 

prevalent in companies that have a higher representation of women 
and women of color.

● Emerging practices are relatively rare—adopted by less than 30 percent 

of all companies—but show promising early results. 

To accelerate progress on gender equality, companies should consider adopting 
more leading and emerging practices—and continue to look for opportunities to 
break new ground.

TRACK METRICS AND SET GOALS

Track representation and attrition by gender and race

Set goals for representation in management and senior leadership by gender and race

Set goals for representation in management and senior leadership by the intersection 
of gender and race (e.g., women of color)

Begin tracking diﬀerences in outcomes between remote, hybrid, and on-site employees 

Track participation and outcomes for employee training and programs 

Survey employees about remote work and ﬂexible scheduling preferences 

Use results of employee surveys to inform programs and policies

HOLD LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROGRESS

Senior leadership reviews diversity metrics at least quarterly

Share diversity metrics publicly 

Provide ﬁnancial incentives to senior leaders for making progress on diversity metrics 

DE-BIAS HIRING AND PROMOTION DECISIONS

Track diﬀerences in hiring and promotion rates 

Set clear and speciﬁc evaluation criteria for hiring and performance reviews 

Share bias reminders before hiring and/or performance review processes begin

A CLOSER LOOK

When implementing new policies and 
programs, companies need to make 
sure they don’t simply “check the box”

Programs need to be high quality—research shows that in some areas, low-quality 
programs can be more harmful than doing nothing at all.52 Similarly, a one-and-done 
approach won’t work. New policies and programs need to be rolled out broadly and 
reinforced over time—for example, employees may need regular refreshers on bias 
training if companies want to achieve long-term cultural change. Companies also 
need to track participation. If relatively few employees are taking advantage of a new 
policy, or the right people aren’t in the room for an important training, initiatives are 
not delivering the intended results. And ﬁnally, companies should evaluate the impact 
of programs to assess whether beneﬁts are equitable and identify areas where certain 
groups may need more targeted support.

CASE STUDY

How Intuit increased the 
number of women in tech roles

What Intuit did

Between 2018 and 2020, Intuit launched two major initiatives designed to grow the representation 
of women in technical roles—one that helps prospective employees upskill, the other that eases 
the on-ramp for employees who’ve taken career breaks:

● The Apprenticeship Pathway Program is a seven-month software development program for 
prospective employees who don’t have a computer science degree and have never worked 
as a technologist. The program is open to people of all genders, but Intuit makes a speciﬁc 
eﬀort to recruit and enroll women and people of color. Apprentices take programming 
courses, work directly on company projects, and receive mentorship from Intuit developers. 
More than 80 percent of apprentices are ultimately hired into full-time roles.

● The “Intuit Again” return to work program is aimed at tech workers who’ve taken career 

breaks, most of whom are women. Participants join an Intuit team for 16 weeks, where they 
receive training to learn new programming languages and work with a dedicated mentor. To 
date, nearly 70 percent of Intuit Again participants have been hired full-time by Intuit.

Results

At Intuit, 33 percent of tech roles are now held by women, up from 27 percent in 2019. This is a 
signiﬁcant increase and puts Intuit well above the average of 29 percent for the technology 
industry overall.

CASE STUDY

How Citi exceeded its representation goals

In 2018, Citi set a representation goal of 40 percent women at the assistant vice president to managing 
director levels by 2021—an important target, since women are underrepresented at these levels in 
banking and consumer ﬁnance.

What Citi did

● Proactive recruiting. In 2021, Citi launched a Diversity Sourcing team in the U.S. to identify
diverse talent, including women in mid-level and senior-level roles. Citi has also invested in 
mentorship programs and internships targeting women college graduates to ensure a strong 
pipeline of women into management roles.

● Inclusive hiring practices. Citi has taken steps to make hiring more inclusive at the assistant vice 

president and managing director levels, such as using diverse slates and oﬀering inclusivity training 
for all hiring managers. The training includes guidance for writing inclusive job descriptions, 
creating diverse slates and interview panels, and for recruiting diverse slates through active 
outreach.

● Developing talented women. Citi has expanded their “Women’s Career Empowerment Program” 
for early and mid-career women so that it now reaches 14,000 employees worldwide. Women 
participate in four training sessions over four months, covering strategic communication, 
decision-making, and networking. The women’s managers also receive training on how to 
support the women’s career growth.

Results

Citi surpassed their own goal: Globally, women now make up 40.6 percent of assistant vice presidents 
through managing directors at Citi, up from 37 percent in 2018–above average representation at this level 
for their industry. Citi has also committed to increasing women at those levels to 43.5 percent by 2025.

50  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: CONCLUSION

CONCLUSION

Companies need to hold on to the 
leaders shaping the future of work

The Covid-19 crisis and racial reckoning of 2020 pushed corporate America 
to reimagine the way we work. Two and a half years in, employees don’t 
want to return to the workplace of the past. They want to move forward. 

This is especially true for women. Women are ambitious and hardworking. 
They’re more inclusive and empathetic leaders. And they want to work for 
companies that are prioritizing the cultural changes that are improving work: 
ﬂexibility, employee well-being, and diversity, equity and inclusion.

Companies that rise to the moment will attract and retain women 
leaders—and this will lead to a better workplace for everyone. 
They’ll win the war for talent today and into the future.

CORPORATE PIPELINE BY INDUSTRY
Industries have diﬀerent talent pipelines

Although women are broadly underrepresented in corporate America, the talent pipeline varies 
by industry. Some industries struggle to attract entry-level women (e.g., Technology: Hardware; IT 
and Telecom; Engineering and Industrial Manufacturing), while others fail to advance women into 
middle management (Energy, Utilities, and Basic Materials) or senior leadership (Oil and Gas).

RESEARCH PARTICIPATION

This report is based on research from 333 companies across the United 
States and Canada, building on similar research conducted annually by 
McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org since 2015, as well as research from 
McKinsey & Company in 2012.

Participating companies from the private, public, and social sectors 
submitted talent pipeline and/or policies and programs data.53 In addition, 
more than 40,000 employees from 55 companies were surveyed on their 
workplace experiences and we interviewed 34 women and non-binary 
individuals, including people of diﬀerent races and ethnicities, LGBTQ+ 
individuals, and people with disabilities at all levels in their organizations 
working remotely, hybrid, or on-site. 

We grouped companies by industry to create benchmarks that provide peer 
comparisons.54 The number of companies from each industry is as follows:55

● Asset Management and Institutional Investors—37

● Banking and Consumer Finance—31    

● Consumer Packaged Goods—5 

● Energy, Utilities, and Basic Materials—14 

● Engineering and Industrial Manufacturing—26       

● Food and Beverage Distribution—9     

● Food and Beverage Manufacturing—15

● Healthcare Systems and Services—19     

● Insurance—9

● IT Services and Telecom—10     

● Media and Entertainment—10     

● Oil and Gas—11

● Pharmaceutical and Medical Products—15   

● Professional and Information Services—11   

● Public and Social Sector—16

● Restaurants—9

● Retail—14  

● Tech: Hardware—18

● Tech: Software—37     

● Transportation, Logistics, and Infrastructure—11 

Companies opted in to the study in response to invitations from McKinsey & 
Company and LeanIn.Org or by indicating interest through our public 
website. Participation in the Employee Experience Survey was encouraged, 
but optional.

All talent pipeline data collection occurred between March and August 2022. 
Talent pipeline data reﬂect representation of men and women as of 
December 31, 2021, as well as personnel changes (e.g., due to promotion, 
hiring, attrition) during 2021. Therefore, all talent pipeline data do not 
represent any changes that occurred during 2022.

Human resource leaders and professionals provided information on policies, 
programs, and priorities on behalf of their company between June and 
September 2022. Additionally, employees were surveyed on their workplace 
experiences between June and August 2022. These data sets represent 
point-in-time snapshots and reﬂect companies’ responses and employees’ 
experiences at the time that the survey was taken.

Where appropriate, some statements describing women’s experiences in 
the workplace were taken from past survey data that have been published 
in prior Women in the Workplace reports.

PIPELINE DATA AND ANALYTICS  

Overall Metrics 

All pipeline metrics (e.g., representation, promotion rates, hiring shares, 
attrition rates) were initially calculated for each participating company. 
Company results were then averaged for each industry and each industry’s 
data were weighted by the composition of the Fortune 500 in 2021. This 
enabled us to avoid overemphasizing or underemphasizing particular 
industries and better estimate trends over time based on each year’s 
sample of companies.

The industry breakdown of the Fortune 500 used for our weighting was:56

● Energy and Basic Materials—15%

● Engineering and Automotive and Industrial Manufacturing—11%

● Finance—19%

● Food and Restaurants—8%

● Healthcare—9%

● Media and Entertainment—3%

● Professional and Information Services—3%

● Retail—17%

● Tech—12%

● Transportation, Logistics, and Infrastructure—4%

Deﬁnition of Job Levels 

Companies categorized their employees into six levels based on the 
following standard deﬁnitions, taking into account reporting structure and 
salaries. The levels and deﬁnitions provided were:

● L1—Executives: CEO and direct reports to CEO, responsible for 
company operations and proﬁtability (board members are not 
included in our primary analyses unless they are also employees)

● L2—Senior vice presidents and other similar roles: senior leaders of 
the organization with signiﬁcant business unit or functional oversight

● L3—Vice presidents and other similar roles: leaders within the 

organization, responsible for activities/initiatives within a subunit of 
a business unit or function, or who report directly to senior vice 
presidents

● L4—Senior managers: seasoned managers and contributors, 

with responsibility for multiple teams and discrete functions or 
operating units

● L5—Managers: junior managers and contributors, responsible for 

small teams and/or functional units or operations

● L6—Entry level: employees responsible for carrying out discrete tasks 
and participating on teams, typically in an oﬃce or corporate setting 
(ﬁeld employees like cashiers or customer service representatives are 
not included in our primary talent pipeline analyses)

Metrics and Analytics 

● Deﬁnition of Aligned Work Arrangements 

Talent pipeline data included the representation of men and women 
(overall, in line versus staﬀ roles, by race/ethnicity, and optionally for 
engineering and product management roles).57 In addition, companies 
reported the number of men and women who were hired, promoted, 
and who left the company (overall, by race/ethnicity, and optionally for 
engineering and product management roles as well as for voluntarily 
versus involuntarily leaving).

Promotion and attrition rates were calculated for women and men, 
overall and by race/ethnicity, at each level. Promotion rates were 
calculated by dividing the number of promotions of that gender into a 
level by the number of employees of that gender in the level below at 
the start of the year. Attrition rates were calculated by dividing the 
number of each gender who left the company at a given level by the 
number of employees of that gender in that level at the start of the year. 
Submitted data were checked for consistency and inconsistent data 
were excluded as needed.

EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE SURVEY AND ANALYTICS 

HR PROGRAMS AND POLICIES
HR PROGRAMS AND POLICIES

Human resource professionals from 317 companies provided information 
on gender diversity policies and programs on behalf of their company. 
We report the percentage of companies that have a program, policy, 
priority, or position out of the total number of companies that submitted 
HR program/policy data. In addition, senior HR leaders (Chief Human 
Resources Oﬃcer or equivalent, Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
or equivalent) from participating companies provided information on 
diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and practices they deemed to 
be most eﬀective at their companies in achieving better outcomes. As 
part of this survey, HR leaders also provided qualitative comments in a 
free text form.

QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS

We conducted individual interviews with 34 women and non-binary 
employees from nine companies across six industries, including Banking 
and Consumer Finance, Engineering and Industrial Manufacturing, and 
Retail. Interviewees were volunteers selected to reﬂect a range of levels, 
departments, and demographic groups. Our interviews focused on 
workplace experiences in order to gain a deeper understanding of the 
quantitative ﬁndings from the employee survey. Individual names, 
company names, and any other identifying information were kept strictly 
conﬁdential and individuals are anonymized in this report. Within the 
quotes, some identifying details may have been altered and/or withheld 
to protect the speaker’s anonymity. Quotes have been edited for clarity.

Survey Participation 

More than 40,000 employees from 55 companies elected to participate 
in the Employee Experience Survey. The survey questions covered 
multiple themes (e.g., overall satisfaction, ﬂexibility and remote/hybrid 
workplaces, advancement, employee well-being, equity and allyship, and 
household characteristics and responsibilities) as well as demographic 
questions (e.g., gender, gender of primary manager, race/ethnicity, age, 
sexual orientation, role, and family status).

Bivariate and Multivariate Statistical Reporting 

Survey results were reported as an unweighted polled average of 
responses across companies. Many of the questions oﬀered a ﬁve-point 
labeled response scale (e.g., “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”). 
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, analyses aggregated the top two and botto
two boxes of the response scale (e.g., “Somewhat agree” and “Strongly 
agree”).

m 

Where we highlight diﬀerences between genders or other groups, we 
highlight only those diﬀerences that are substantial and reliable. To 
that end, all diﬀerences noted in this report are statistically signiﬁcant to 
a 95 percent conﬁdence level using a two-tailed test and/or reﬂect a 
diﬀerence of at least ﬁve percentage points between two groups unless 
otherwise indicated.

● Deﬁnition of Remote Work Status Composite Variable 

PParticipants were ask
ed how often they currently work remotely 
articipants were asked how often they currently work remotely 
and were given ﬁve interval-level responses as options. During the 
and were given ﬁve interval-level responses as options. During the 
data analysis, the ﬁve options were transformed into the following 
data analysis, the ﬁve options were transformed into the following 
composite variables:
composite variables:

○ Mostly remote: 91% to 100% (always or almost always)

○ Hybrid: 20% to 50% (i.e., one or two days a week), 

51% to 90% (i.e., three or four days a week)

○ Mostly on-site: 0% (not working remotely at all), less than 

20% (i.e., less than one day a week)

HR AND DEI BEST PRACTICES

DEI best practices are based on top performer analysis conducted with pipeline 
data and HR survey data, supplemented by external research, past Women in the 
Workplace studies, and responses from senior leaders about what has been most 
eﬀective in improving representation and advancement of women.

We used talent pipeline data from 97 companies that participated in 2019 and 
2022 to identify top performers in the representation of women and women of 
color. We compared their total women and women of color representation for L2 to 
L6 from 2021 (data from Women in the Workplace 2022)  to their past performance 
in 2018 (data from Women in the Workplace 2019) and to their industry’s average 
for these values. L1 was excluded from analysis due to the high variability of this 
level.  

We then ranked the companies by the extent to which they improved over time 
and outperformed this year’s industry benchmarks for total women and women 
of color representation from L2 to L6 in the pipeline to identify the top and bottom 
quartiles of companies. 

Leading practices were based on the top performer analysis and deﬁned as 
practices where there was a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the percentage 
of top performing companies (n = 24) and all other companies in that analysis (n = 
73) that have adopted that practice. In cases where recommendations included 
multiple individual practices (e.g., sponsorship and mentorship programs for 
women and/or women of color), the recommendation was classiﬁed as a leading 
practice if there was at least one statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between top 
performers and all other companies in the analyses for any of the listed practices. 

In addition to leading practices, we used two other ways of classifying 
recommended practices:  

Table stakes (sometimes referred to as “common practices”)—practices that we 
recommend and that are very common (at least 75 percent of the 317 companies 
who completed the HR survey did this). 

Emerging practices—practices that we recommend that are not yet common 
(fewer than 30 percent of all companies who completed the HR survey did this) 
and where the top performer analysis of 97 companies showed promise through a 
small but not statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in prevalence for top performers.

1   This report contains stock photographs for illustrative purposes only. Images do not reﬂect the identities of the women quoted. Within the quotes, some 
identifying details may have been altered and/or withheld to protect the speaker’s anonymity.

2   In this study, “women” includes cisgender and transgender women. Due to small sample sizes for transgender women, data are reported for “women 
overall” or “LGBTQ+ women” in aggregate. Women of color include Black, Latina, Asian, Native American/American Indian/Indigenous or Alaskan Native, 
Native Hawaiian, Paciﬁc Islander, Middle Eastern, or mixed-race women. Due to small sample sizes for other racial and ethnic groups, reported ﬁndings on 
individual racial/ethnic groups are restricted to Black women, Latinas, and Asian women.

3   Except where otherwise noted, “women leaders” refers to employees at the senior manager level and above (L4 to L1 in Methodology). Findings for 
“women leaders” may not hold for CEOs and other C-suite executives as there is high variability due to the relatively small size of the C-suite population.

4   LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Company, Women in the Workplace 2019 (October 2019), https://womenintheworkplace.com/. 

5   Women and men leaders are equally likely to want to get promoted: 78 percent of women leaders and 78 percent of men leaders are interested in 
getting promoted to the next level at their organization. And women and men leaders are similarly likely to want to be senior leaders at their company (81 
percent of women leaders and 85 percent of men leaders). However, men leaders are more interested than women leaders in becoming top executives 
(57 percent of men leaders and 49 percent of women leaders). Full questions: How interested are you in doing the following at your company? 
[Respondents selected from “Extremely/slightly interested,” “Neither interested nor uninterested,” “Extremely/somewhat uninterested,” and “Not sure”] | 
Getting promoted to the next level; Managing a team (1 or more full-time employees); Being a senior leader. (Note: This scale is asymmetrical due to an 
error; however, this didn’t aﬀect analysis of grouped results.) Do you want to be a top executive? | Yes; No; I already am a top executive.

6   Except where otherwise noted, “young women” and “young men” refer to employees under the age of 30.

7   Except where otherwise noted, “senior leadership” refers to individuals at the vice president level or above (L3 to L1 in Methodology).

8  Total percent of women and men per level in the race and gender pipeline may not sum to overall corporate pipeline totals, as the race pipeline does 
not include employees with unreported race data. Some percentages may sum to 99 percent or 101 percent due to rounding. Pipeline data in this report is 
based on data from the end of 2021 and does not reﬂect changes through 2022. 

9   In this study, numbers for the “broken rung” assume an equal number of men, women, and women of color at entry-level (L6 in Methodology). 

10   In this chart, data for voluntary attrition from 2017 to 2021 comes from unpublished pipeline data for the 2018 to 2022 Women in the Workplace 
reports. Voluntary attrition rates for men and women leaders (L4 to L1 in Methodology) were calculated by weighting each employee level’s voluntary 
attrition rate by the end of year composition.

11   In this study, unless otherwise noted, “voluntary attrition” refers to employees who left their organization of their own volition.

12   Data for women in engineering and technical roles is based on the following question: Do you work in an engineering or technical ﬁeld (e.g., 
engineering, product development, data science)? | Yes; No. In 2018, this question was slightly diﬀerent: Do you work in an engineering or technical 
department (e.g., engineering, product development, data science)? | Yes; No.

13   U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Occupational Outlook Handbook,” ﬁltered by pay (“more than $80,000/year”) and occupation growth rate (“faster than 
average or much faster than average”), September 8, 2022, 
https://www.bls.gov/ooh/occupation-ﬁnder.htm?pay=$80,000+or+more&education=&training=&newjobs=&growth=Faster+than+average&submit=GO. 

14   Data show that when managers take action to support employee well-being and promote inclusion, employees have better experiences. Full question: 
Which of the following actions has your manager taken consistently in the past year? | Shown interest in your career advancement (e.g., asked about your 
career goals); Encouraged respectful and inclusive behavior on your team; Checked in on your personal well-being; Trusted you to get your work done 
without micromanaging; Worked with you to make sure your workload is manageable; Made sure you got credit for your work; Given you helpful feedback; 
None of these.

17   In this study, “ﬂexibility” refers to remote or hybrid work, as well as ﬂexible work options such as the ability to set your own hours.

18   Full question: Compared to how you felt two years ago, how important are the following to you now: [Respondents selected from “Less important 
now,” “Just as important,” “More important,” “Was never important,” and “Not sure”] | Flexibility (e.g., being able to work remotely and/or set your own work 
hours); Working at an organization that prioritizes diversity, equity, and inclusion; Working at an organization that is committed to employee well-being; 
Having a supportive manager; Being recognized and rewarded for your work.

19   In this study, unless otherwise noted, “people management” refers to actions taken by managers to support employees’ well-being and career 
development. This ﬁnding on women leaders and DEI is from LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Company, Women in the Workplace 2021, unpublished data. 

20   See endnote 23 for the full question.

21   In this study, “older women” and “older employees” refer to women or employees over the age of 40. 

22  Full question: Why did you leave your last job? | I wanted more options to work remotely; I wanted a more ﬂexible work schedule (e.g., ability to set my 
own work hours); My workload was unmanageable; My manager wasn’t supportive; I didn’t feel welcome (e.g., I was excluded or treated disrespectfully); I 
wanted to do more meaningful or inspiring work; I wanted more opportunity to advance; I wanted to work for an organization more committed to diversity, 
equity, and inclusion; I had an opportunity that oﬀered better pay and/or beneﬁts; I left for personal reasons (e.g., I relocated); Other. This question was only 
asked of people who switched jobs in the last two years. The number given for “ﬂexibility” in this chart is a composite of “I wanted more options to work 
remotely” and/or “I wanted a more ﬂexible schedule (e.g., ability to set my own work hours). For “opportunity to advance,” the diﬀerence between men and 
women leaders is not statistically signiﬁcant

23   Full question: Over the last two years, has career advancement (e.g., getting promoted) become more or less important to you? | Less important now; 
Just as important; More important now; Not sure. See endnote 18 for the second question.

24   “1 in 3” was obtained by subtracting the percentage of Black women leaders who selected “None of these” from 100 percent. Full question: In the last 
year, have you felt that any of the following personal characteristics have played a role in you being denied or passed over for a raise, promotion, or 
chance to get ahead? | Your gender; Your race/ethnicity; Having a disability or health issue; Your sexual orientation; Your age; Being a parent; Being a 
remote employee; None of these.

25   This visual presents data for all women and men, not just those who live with a spouse or partner. Full question: When it comes to household 
responsibilities (e.g., housework, childcare, managing family's schedule, helping children with school), would you say… | You are responsible for all of the 
work; You are responsible for most of the work; You share responsibilities equally with a partner; Your partner is responsible for most of the work; Your 
partner is responsible for all of the work; Someone else (e.g., family member, nanny) is responsible for all or most of the work. 

26   Psychological safety is the belief among employees that it's safe to take interpersonal risks. It means employees believe they won't be punished or 
humiliated if they propose new ideas, raise concerns and issues, or admit mistakes. Amy Edmondson, “Psychological Safety and Learning Behavior in 
Work Teams,” Administrative Science Quarterly 44, no. 2 (June 1999): 350–83, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2666999. Full question: 
Which of the following are true on your team? | [Select all that apply] People aren’t penalized for making mistakes; People feel comfortable disagreeing 
with each other; People rarely exclude other team members; People celebrate each other’s accomplishments; Everyone’s work is valued; People listen to 
each other’s ideas and concerns; None of these.

27   “Asian women” refers to women of South Asian, East Asian, and Southeast Asian origin or descent. Unless otherwise stated, “Asian women” does not 
include individuals of Paciﬁc Islander, Native Hawaiian, West Asian, or Middle Eastern origin or descent.

28   Due to small sample sizes, all women identifying as lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, otherwise non-heterosexual, and/or transgender were analyzed and 
reported in a single category as LGBTQ+ women. This means that, throughout this report, the composite “LGBTQ+” most closely describes the experiences 
of larger groups in the sample (e.g., lesbians and bisexual women).

29   This visualization utilizes data from multiple survey questions. See endnotes 31 to 34 for the full list of questions. Categories represented in this table 
(e.g., LGBTQ+ women, white women, women with disabilities, etc.) are not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive even within subcategories (e.g., 
some women with disabilities are also LGBTQ+ and fall across racial/ethnic categories).

30   The LGBTQ+ population in this sample signiﬁcantly diﬀers from the overall population (e.g., skews much younger), which may aﬀect the results 
presented in this study.

Not sure; Other. 

36   Throughout this study, when referring to employees’ current work situations, “mostly on-site” refers to employees who work remotely 0 percent to 20 
percent of the time (i.e., less than one day a week). “Hybrid” refers to employees who work remotely 21 percent to 90 percent of the time (i.e., between 
one and four days a week). “Mostly remote” refers to employees who work remotely 91 percent to 100 percent of the time (i.e., always or almost always).

39   Percentages in this chart may not sum to 100 because options such as “Not sure” and “Other” are not depicted in data visualizations. For the full 
question, see endnote 35.

40   “Women work where they want to” refers to women who work mostly remotely and want to work mostly remotely or women who work mostly on-site 
and want to work mostly on-site. “Women don’t work where they want to” refers to women who work mostly remotely and want to work mostly on-site or 
women who work mostly on-site and want to work mostly remotely. Neither group includes women who work or want to work in a hybrid environment. “I’m 
rarely burned out” is a composite of respondents who selected “Seldom” and “Almost never.” Full question: In the last few months, how often have you felt 
burned out at work? | Almost never; Seldom; Sometimes; Often; Almost always; Not sure.

41   In this study, an “othering microaggression” refers to: Having had others comment on your appearance in a way that makes you uncomfortable; People

look mad or should smile more); Hearing or overhearing negative comments about your accent or way of speaking. See endnote 33 for the full question 
text. Notable diﬀerences are between those working mostly on-site and those working mostly remotely. In some cases, diﬀerences between those working 
hybrid and other groups are not signiﬁcant.

48   See endnote 26 for the full question.

49   Full question: Which of the following are true for you on most workdays? | You feel like you need to be available 24/7 (e.g., checking email at all hours); 
You feel like you have to prove you’re working; You have the information and resources you need to get your work done; You’re in meetings for most of 
the day; You have a chance to work on things that feel meaningful and important; You feel overwhelmed (e.g., you can’t get all of your work done in the 
time you have); You feel like you can be honest with your colleagues about challenges you’re facing; None of these.  

50   Full questions: Overall how happy are you with the following? [Respondents selected from “Somewhat/very unhappy,” “Neither unhappy nor happy,” or 
“Somewhat/very happy”] | Your job. I would recommend this organization as a great place to work. | Somewhat/strongly disagree; Neither disagree nor

unlikely nor likely; Somewhat/very likely; Not sure. For the full text of the fourth question, see endnote 40.

51   In this study, “common practice” or “table stakes” refers to practices that are standard in most (≥75 percent of the 317 participants in the HR survey for 
2022) organizations—they’re important but not driving enough progress on their own. “Leading practice” refers to practices that are less standard (< 75 
percent) but more prevalent in companies that have both improved women’s representation (including women of color) and outperformed their industry 
from 2019 to 2022 when compared to other companies with data from the same time period. A recommendation is classiﬁed as a leading practice if at 
least one of the named actions shows a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between top performing companies and other companies. “Emerging practice” 
refers to those that are less common (< 30 percent of organizations that participated in 2022 do these things) but show promising early results. See 
Methodology for more details. Policies and programs highlighted in this table are not exhaustive of all table stakes, emerging practices, or leading 
practices analyzed.

53   Participating companies were required to have a minimum of 1,000 U.S. and Canadian employees to participate. Exceptions were addressed on a 
case-by-case basis. 

54   A minimum of ﬁve companies is required to create an industry benchmark.

55   Overall weighted pipeline is based on 311 private-sector ﬁrms and does not include Public and Social Sector organizations or Law Firms. Three Law 
Firms were excluded from this list as they did not meet the minimum benchmark threshold of ﬁve companies per industry.

56   Percentages sum to 101 percent due to rounding.

57   Representation calculations by gender include data for employees whose race was not reported. However, representation calculations by 
race/ethnicity and gender do not include data for employees whose race was not reported.
