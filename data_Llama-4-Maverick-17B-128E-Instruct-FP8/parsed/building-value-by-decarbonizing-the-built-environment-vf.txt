Building value by decarbonizing the built environment

Executive summary

Decarbonizing the built environment is possible 
and has the potential to generate significant 
value—but the industry must come together to 
scale solutions. 

The built-environment ecosystem consists of  
real estate and infrastructure and touches all 
aspects of human life, from homes and offices to 
factories and highways. It is also responsible for 
about of a quarter of the world’s greenhouse-gas 
(GHG) emissions. 

To help industry players make progress toward 
decarbonization, this report assesses the most 
effective solutions available today. Our analysis 
shows that many levers not only have proven 
abatement potential but are also already cost-
effective. In other words, companies across the 
built-environment ecosystem could derive value 
immediately from these lower-emitting technologies 
and solutions.

Further decarbonization levers would be cost-
effective by 2030 if they are industrialized— 
that is, produced and implemented at scale with a 
focus on quality, cost, and time to market. Because 
today’s value chains are often fragmented 
and localized, industrialization poses its own 
challenge. However, those that act now will 
likely be able to take advantage of powerful new 
business opportunities as global decarbonization 
gains traction. This report identifies 17 such 
opportunities that could prove particularly 
attractive for industry players.

Together, the 22 levers we highlight can  
potentially reduce overall emissions from the  
built environment by up to 75 percent if 
implemented at scale in the next five to ten years. 

In these efforts, all companies in the ecosystem 
can have significant roles to play. By creating 
partnerships and focusing their efforts and 
investments, ecosystem players can find mutually 
beneficial ways forward while building a net- 
zero world.

About the analysis
To find the most effective solutions to reduce 
emissions, we analyzed more than 1,000 levers 
for their abatement potential, cost-effectiveness, 
and scalability. Out of these, we selected the most 
promising levers for more rigorous examination. 
This involved comparing their impact and technical 
applicability across six asset archetypes: single- 
and multifamily dwellings, commercial low- and 
high-rise buildings, industrial buildings, and 
infrastructure. These archetypes represent about 
three-quarters of the built environment. 

For each archetype, the net cost of applicable levers 
was compared with the cost of traditional practices. 
Levers were considered both as they exist today 
and if they were to be applied at scale. Last, each 
lever was assessed across four geographies and 
two climate zones to determine if regionally specific 
factors, such as climate and regulatory differences, 
affected net cost.

Notably, we did not consider changes in regulatory 
and policy frameworks when assessing costs and 
business opportunities for given levers. Although 
regulatory incentives could create tailwinds for 
adoption, this report does not take the impact 
of these factors into account to emphasize that 
significant progress can be made solely through 
actions by ecosystem players today.

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentA serious challenge
Because the built environment encompasses 
the whole planet, the movement toward its 
decarbonization needs to be global in scope. The 
built environment accounts for 14.4 metric gigatons 
of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) of emissions around the 
world annually (Exhibit 1). Approximately 26 percent 
of all GHG emissions and 37 percent of combustion-
related emissions come from the construction and 
operation of the built environment. 

Emissions come from all phases of the 
construction process, from carbon-intensive 
material production processes and suboptimal 
technology choices to inefficient building designs, 
construction practices, and energy use after 
projects are completed. These emissions can 
be grouped into operational emissions (related 
to operating and maintaining buildings and 
structures) and embodied emissions (related to 

producing and transporting building materials and 
constructing buildings and structures). 

Although many solutions already exist to abate 
both operational and embodied emissions, 
the clock is ticking on their implementation. 
Operational emissions are constantly being 
released from already-built construction, and  
once embodied emissions are released, they can 
only be offset, not abated. 

Industrializing solutions that work
All areas of the built environment can benefit 
from decarbonization, and some have particularly 
powerful abatement options. For example, on 
average, space heating and water heating emissions 
compose roughly three-quarters of operational 
emissions for residential buildings, making them 
an excellent target for decarbonization (Exhibit 2). 
According to our analysis, a single lever—heat

60 percent. This and many other effective levers 
are already cost-neutral relative to conventional 
solutions. Even more levers are expected to be cost-
neutral or marginally more expensive by 2030 if 
they can be scaled. 

In this report, we found that 22 levers had 
particularly strong potential due to their high 
abatement potential, cost-effectiveness, and 
applicability across archetypes and regions. 
These levers can reduce operational emissions by 
up to 90 percent and embodied emissions by up

to 60 percent for most of the built environment.1 
However, a number of potentially effective levers 
face a central challenge: industrialization. No matter 
their abatement potential, if decarbonization levers 
and solutions cannot be produced and implemented 
at scale, ecosystem players will not be able to realize 
their full impact. 

transportation and in purchasing. An industrialized 
ecosystem can also enable technicians to gain 
skills and experience to drive process efficiencies. 
Increasing the number of units produced can 
reduce capital expenditures per unit, and the 
stable customer demand created by a steadier, 
cost-effective supply of sustainable options can 
decrease risk and financing costs. 

To industrialize decarbonization solutions, 
players will likely need to address challenges in 
the ecosystem that could deter their widespread 
adoption. The built environment may span the 
globe, but it varies widely at a local level and 
throughout the value chain. Players are often 
regional, overlapping, and varied in their objectives 
and business models. In addition, the established 
industry practices that do exist can be difficult 
to change. Because many of the solutions are 
relatively new or unconventional for the industry, 
industry players may be unaware of the abatement 
benefits and economic potential of certain levers, 
and financial institutions and insurers can be 
hesitant to support their deployment. Industry 
players may also face shortages of both labor 
and materials during the next five to ten years 
as value chains scale, though our analysis of the 
most impactful levers is not constrained by these 
potential shortages. 

Despite these challenges, there are many 
incentives to industrialize decarbonization levers. 
Industrialization is likely to reduce input costs 
in several ways. For instance, by establishing 
procurement best practices, players can develop 
consistent supply chains and find efficiencies in 

How businesses can unlock value 
through decarbonization opportunities
Early movers that are able to lead industrialization 
and commercial adoption of decarbonization 
solutions are likely to create and capture value 
from this transition. Among the hundreds of 
possible business opportunities in decarbonizing 
the built environment, we have highlighted 17 
that could deliver significant value for ecosystem 
players (Exhibit 3). Industry incumbents and 
disruptors could act upon these opportunities to 
accelerate adoption, application, and scaling of 
levers before 2030. 

The value-generating potential of these levers 
extends across the entire built-environment 
ecosystem, from real estate owners and developers 
to investors, construction companies, material 
manufacturers, and design and engineering firms. 
Capturing these opportunities could require 
industry players to assess their existing capabilities, 
design future potential operating models, and build 
green businesses to develop new capabilities. 
For instance, engineering, procurement, and

existing certification practices. To fully reach net-zero emissions for the built environment, other solutions and technologies will likely be 
needed beyond 2030.

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentconstruction (EPC) firms have an opportunity to 
design, develop, and implement carbon capture, 
utilization, and storage (CCUS) solutions for cement 
plants and high-emitting industrial clusters. And 
real estate developers, investors, and financiers can 
generate value by turning existing assets into green 
assets and setting specifications for green solutions 
and materials to drive offtake.

For many of these opportunities, players should 
consider acting together to realize maximum value. 
Collaboration across the value chain will likely be 
critical for success, even among competitors. For 
example, multiple real estate companies could 
collectively commit to procuring and installing 
low-carbon building materials, technologies, and 
services, thereby creating demand, increasing 
cost competitiveness through scale, and enabling 
investments thanks to reduced commercial risk. 

In addition to horizontal collaboration, players in 
the built-environment ecosystem will likely need to 
create partnerships vertically throughout the value 
chain. Both new and incumbent manufacturers of 

materials and technologies (such as low-carbon 
insulation and engineered wood) can adopt best 
practices regarding process decarbonization 
and commercialization. They can also proactively 
approach and educate real estate developers to 
create demand. To support these decarbonization 
efforts, investors and financiers could identify 
high-potential suppliers and partner with forward-
leaning real estate players to develop and provide 
competitive financing solutions.

The need to decarbonize the built environment 
is urgent, and significant progress can be made 
with technologies, materials, and solutions that 
are available today and are proved to have strong 
decarbonization potential. If ecosystem players can 
move quickly to assess which green businesses 
to build or fund, which business models could 
help create scale, and which partnerships would 
be beneficial, they are likely to capture economic 
benefits from opportunities that are executable in 
the near term.

Decarbonizing the built  
environment: A global challenge 

Accelerating decarbonization in the built 
environment is essential for a sustainable 
future, but industry challenges need to 
be addressed for solutions to scale.

As one of the world’s largest economic ecosystems, 
the built environment is also one of the world’s 
highest emitters, releasing more greenhouse 
gases (GHGs) than either the transportation or 
industrial sectors. In total, the built environment 
is responsible for approximately 26 percent of all 
GHG emissions and approximately 37 percent of 
global CO2 equivalent (CO₂e) emissions from fuel 
combustion (Exhibit 1). Given the volume of the built 
environment’s emissions, it is crucial to decarbonize 
this industry to achieve global sustainability goals. 

In absolute terms, the built environment contributes 
up to 14.4 metric gigatons (Gt) of CO2e to the 
atmosphere annually. Assuming limited changes 
to how building stock is managed, operated, 
and constructed, this number could rise by 10 to 
15 percent in total by 2030.

The typical 30- to 130-year lifetime of a building 
means that of the building stock expected to exist 
in 2050, 80 percent has already been built,1 which 
points to two imperatives. First, decisions made 
today will have consequences for decades to come. 
Therefore, it is critical to design and build energy-
efficient buildings to avoid increasing stock that 
will require energy upgrades in the future and to 
use low-emissions materials to avoid up-front 
embodied emissions that can never be recovered. 

Second, it is important to improve the energy 
efficiency of most existing buildings (see sidebar, 
“Buildings and energy demand”). Both imperatives 
can be addressed by identifying green products 
and materials that lower or eliminate emissions 
footprints and by retrofitting energy-efficient 
solutions that reduce operational emissions.  

Given the scale of the economic transition 
required to decarbonize, companies that lead 

Buildings and energy demand

In a decarbonized world, power grids will have 
the burden of serving the needs of the built envi-
ronment as well as fully electric automotive fleets. 
This will require enormous increases in renewable 
capacity, energy storage, and transmission and 
distribution infrastructure. 

This poses a challenge for the built-environment 
ecosystem. To eliminate emissions for a given 
building, electrifying assets such as gas 
furnaces is an excellent option. However, as 
adoption of electric assets grows, electric grids 
will be put under increasing stress. Therefore, 
companies in the built-environment ecosystem 
have a strong incentive to not only increase 
project electrification but also reduce energy 
consumption. Both of these goals can be achieved 
by upgrading inefficient processes and technology 
to options that are more energy efficient.

in sustainability are likely to succeed. Capital 
markets are expecting companies to take prompt 
action on decarbonization, and players in the built 
environment are increasingly setting aggressive 
targets. There is also significant pressure to 
decarbonize because of factors such as regulatory 
requirements, employee needs, and customer 
demands for environmentally sustainable solutions.

Despite these strong incentives, progress 
in decarbonizing the built environment has 
been limited for a variety of reasons. The built 
environment is complex and fragmented, with 
different players and business models at every 
step in the value chain. It is also highly local, with 
varying standards, building codes, and decision 
makers—often with partially conflicting objectives. 

Arrangements are typically project-based, 
with temporary, nonstandardized agreements. 
Companies also often operate on small margins and 
have a limited ability to take risks by investing in new 
businesses and solutions. And though many levers 
to decarbonize the built environment are proved, 
there is a lack of transparency and knowledge about 
which of these levers are cost-effective today or 
could be if industrialized.2  

In light of this urgency and these challenges, finding 
solutions that meet both abatement and cost 
requirements is imperative. Many of these solutions 
and technologies already exist and can drive 
significant improvements at low (or even negative) 
net costs. 

2 We define “industrialize” as “to produce and implement a lever at scale with a focus on quality, cost, and time to market.”

Finding the  
solutions that work

Our analysis shows there are many 
levers available to decarbonize the built 
environment in a cost-effective manner 
and meet global emissions targets.

Achieving net-zero emissions for the built 
environment is a bold endeavor and will require 
significant investment. While a sizable challenge, 
there are many pathways with proven technologies 
and solutions that can get the industry there. A 
number of these are already cost-effective today. 

Emissions baseline and 
initial lever pool
To assess how effective levers were at abating 
emissions, we compared them to a global emissions 
baseline. Of the approximately 14.4 Gt of global 
emissions contributed by the built environment, 
approximately two-thirds are operational (related to 
the daily operations of a building, such as electricity 
consumption) and one-third are embodied (related 
to the materials used to build the structure) (Exhibit 
2). Roughly three-quarters of operational emissions 
are attributable solely to residential buildings, while 
the remaining quarter comes from commercial 
buildings. Infrastructure contributes little to no 
operational emissions once constructed. By 
contrast, embodied emissions are shared roughly 
equally between residential buildings, commercial 
buildings, and infrastructure. 

Our goal was to identify the levers that could best 
accelerate near-term decarbonization in the built 
environment, accounting for their abatement 
potential, cost-effectiveness, and potential to be 
industrialized. For our analysis, we focused on 
proven levers with demonstrated use cases, known 
or tested abatement potential, and the potential to 
be applied at scale. 

There may be other disruptive solutions with greater 
abatement potential in development that will be 
available in the near future. At the time of this 
report’s publication, however, these solutions either 
did not have established and industry-accepted 
use cases or had not demonstrated potential to 
be applied at scale. Therefore, we did not consider 
them in our analysis. In any case, similarly to the 
levers we touch on, these solutions would also 
benefit from investments and resources in the near 
term to have the potential to scale.  

Identifying carbon- and 
cost-effective levers
Through academic research and input from 
McKinsey experts and industry leaders, 
we identified and mapped more than 1,000 
decarbonization levers applicable to the built 
environment. These levers were compared with 
emissions baselines and systematically analyzed 
across three main attributes: abatement potential, 
net cost change today, and net cost change  
by 2030.

 — Abatement potential is defined as the potential 
reduction in emissions for each lever relative

to the corresponding emissions baseline. 
For example, using biomass as an alternative 
fuel can reduce overall emissions3 during 
cement production by up to 40 percent, as 
compared with an emissions baseline of using a 
conventional fuel such as coal or petroleum coke. 

 — Net cost change today indicates the estimated 
cost increase or decrease associated with 
applying a given lever relative to the cost of the 
existing or conventional practice that the lever 
is intended to replace. The net cost comparison 
considers both capital and operations and 
maintenance (O&M) costs, including savings 
from reduced energy consumption.

 — Net cost change based on expected costs in 
2030 estimates the cost in 2030 if the lever is 
produced and installed at scale. Industrialization 
will reduce input costs through implementing 
procurement best practices, enabling 
technicians to gain experience and drive process 
efficiencies, reducing the capital expenditures 
per unit by increasing the number of units 
produced, and decreasing the risk and financing 
cost because of stable customer demand. 

Using these criteria, we narrowed down the list of 
levers for analysis to around 150 based on impact 
potential and technological and commercial 
feasibility. These levers were then classified into 

3 Considering net emissions potentially created from the use of biomass.

14

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentfour main categories based on their net cost of 
application: 

 — Cost-effective today. These levers are 

technically and commercially viable and are 
cost-neutral or cost-positive today relative 
to conventional solutions. Assessed on a net 
cost basis (capital and O&M), these levers are 
either equal to or less expensive than existing 
practices. Any up-front additional costs can 
be recuperated through subsequent savings 
on O&M, including efficiency savings and 
utility costs. Many of the operational levers 
are compared based on total costs as well as 
on their potential return (such as lower energy 
costs due to increased energy efficiency). 
Levers in this category are therefore assessed 
to be ROI positive. 

 — Cost-effective by 2030 or earlier, if 

industrialized. These levers are currently 
technically proved but more expensive than 
conventional alternatives today. If industrialized, 
these levers are expected to be commercially 
viable. Industrialization results in increased 
scale and process efficiencies, which in turn 
results in lower unit costs. Therefore, the net 
expected cost of applying these levers in 
2030 could be lower than the expected cost of 
conventional practices in 2030.

 — Marginally more expensive by 2030, if 

industrialized. In this category, levers are 
technically proved to have a significant impact 
on emissions but would still be marginally 
more expensive after industrialization than 
conventional alternatives. In this case, we 
define “marginally more expensive” as a net cost 
increase of up to 5 percent for the given lever 
based on expected costs by 2030. 

 — Significantly more expensive by 2030 or not 
technically viable. These levers are either 
expected to be significantly more expensive 
than conventional practices in 2030, even 
if industrialized, or are not expected to be 
viable for industrialization by 2030 without a 
significant technological breakthrough. Here, 

we considered a net cost increase of more than 
5 percent for the given lever based on expected 
costs in 2030.

To be conservative, the net cost analysis does 
not consider incentives, carbon price changes, or 
green premiums. We use today’s average prices 
for conventional solutions or commodities, such as 
steel and cement, and do not factor in significant or 
unexpected price changes by 2030. If jurisdiction-
specific incentives and green premiums are applied, 
it is possible that several of the marginally or 
significantly more expensive levers will also be cost-
effective by 2030.  

Sorting levers for embodied 
and abated emissions
Once effective levers were identified, they were 
sorted for ease of analysis and clarity of purpose in 
the overall construction process.

For embodied emissions, the top levers were 
categorized into four groups aligned with different 
phases of the construction process. This allowed for 
them to be applied sequentially and considered in 
conjunction with one another, capturing the overall 
abatement potential of the entire process.

 — Design optimization levers are applied at the 
design stage, prior to on-site construction. 
As the first levers, these have the most 
cascading effects and can be used to reduce 
the archetype’s overall emissions baseline 
while reducing costs and schedule extensions. 
These levers enable simplification of 
building design due to standardization and 
efficiency improvements. As a result, smaller 
quantities of materials are needed, and 
overall embodied emissions are reduced, both 
through incorporating green components or 
processes and through efficiencies resulting 
from using fewer materials and resources. 
Design decisions can also affect operational 
efficiencies of archetypes and can help lower 
operational emissions.   

15

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentFor embodied emissions, the top 
levers were categorized into four 
groups aligned with different phases 
of the construction process.

 — Material substitution levers are applied at the 
preconstruction stage. These levers reduce 
emissions by replacing traditional materials 
used in manufacturing or end-products 
with low-carbon alternatives. By choosing 
materials that emit less during production 
or are more locally available, embodied 
emissions can be avoided. For instance, 
reducing or replacing clinkers in cement with 
low-carbon alternatives, often referred to as 
supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), 
has potential to abate emissions.

 — On-site improvement levers are applied 

once construction has begun and can reduce 
emissions stemming from the construction 
process. For instance, fuel or materials used in 
the construction process can be substituted 
with alternative fuels or clean power sources, 
enabling a reduction in the emissions footprint 
at this stage.

 — Process decarbonization levers broaden to 

encompass the entire construction value chain. 
They are applied at the material-manufacturing 
stage and address remaining emissions from 
conventional materials with larger emissions 
footprints. Steel and cement, for example, 
have conventional manufacturing processes 
that are highly emissive due to the use of fuels 
such as coal, petroleum coke, and natural 
gas. Replacing these with proven renewable 
and low-carbon fuels such as hydrogen and 
biomass will enable a significantly lower 
emissions footprint during manufacturing. 

Top operational levers were similarly categorized 
into four groups: 

 — Space heating and cooling levers are ways to 

more efficiently heat or cool a space with fewer 
emissions, with the heater either within the 
space or external to it.

 — Water heating levers use low-carbon methods 

to heat water for residential buildings.

 — Cooking levers enable users to shift from 

traditional gas cooking appliances to more 
efficient cooking methods.

 — Appliances and lighting levers include using 
more-energy-efficient home appliances and 
light sources.

Unlike embodied levers, which are typically 
applied sequentially, operational levers can be 
applied simultaneously, in some cases to capture 
additional abatement from synergies between 
levers. For example, installing energy efficiency 
measures first can reduce the overall required 
heat pump capacity and cost. If strategically 
implemented, the economics of each lever can be 
improved in this manner.

Applying levers to global archetypes
Finally, to pressure test the levers with the  
highest impact and demonstrate their applicability, 
abatement efficacy, and cost-efficiency, we  
applied them to six common archetypes that we 
believe represent about three-quarters of the  
built environment ecosystem: single- and 
multifamily dwellings, commercial low- and 
high-rise buildings, industrial buildings (such as 
manufacturing plants), and infrastructure builds 
(such as roads and highways). 

16

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentThese chosen archetypes were modeled to span 
four regions (China, Europe, India, and North 
America) and three climate zones (cold, warm,  
and temperate) to capture variations in building 
codes and standards and in construction and 
operational practices.4 For each archetype, 
we identified the embodied and operational 
abatement levers that were most impactful and 
relevant to the archetype. 

From our initial pool, we identified 22 levers 
that could have a particularly strong impact on 
decarbonization due to their high abatement 
potential, cost-effectiveness, and applicability 
across archetypes and regions. To illustrate how we 
determined which levers were most effective and to 
offer some examples of selected levers, we provide 
two case studies in the next chapter.

4 These regional variations are not the focus of this report, although for some levers, we do address their impact.

Two case studies  
in decarbonization

Of our six archetype analyses, two illustrative 
case studies—a multifamily dwelling in North 
America and a large infrastructure project 
in Europe—were chosen to provide a detailed 
view of our approach and demonstrate the 
range of applicability of decarbonization 
levers to both buildings and infrastructure. 

a building has an embodied emissions baseline of 
about 4,000 metric tons, estimated from a material 
composition and weight baseline of about 13,000 
metric tons. Though the cost and abatement 
potential for specific levers are based on a North 
American structure, the results and levers we 
recommend are reasonably applicable to other 
geographies and climates, with some region-
specific nuances. 

Multifamily dwellings are common throughout 
the world and have material compositions that are 
close to single-family dwellings and commercial 
buildings. Therefore, the majority of the top 
operational- and embodied-emission abatement 
levers applied to this archetype are also applicable 
to other archetypes. 

As for large infrastructure projects and upgrades, 
they are similarly relevant around the world  
and will be increasingly important sites of 
investment and development as populations grow. 
These two archetypes represent common use 
cases across the built environment, and, barring 
regional and jurisdictional differences, results for 
these can be reasonably scaled and applied across 
the broader ecosystem. 

Archetype 1: Multifamily dwelling 
in North America in a cold climate
A multifamily dwelling refers to a residential building 
that houses multiple families, such as an apartment 
complex. An example of this archetype might be 
a 5,500-square-meter, five-story building in a 
cold climate in North America. On average, such 

Top levers to abate embodied emissions
For multifamily residential dwellings, most 
embodied emissions—about 2,000 metric tons or 
50 percent—are driven by concrete, followed by 
steel, with about 900 metric tons or 22 percent 
(Exhibit 3).

Of the 1,000 levers assessed, we determined that 
approximately 50 were relevant to this archetype. 
Out of these, the top nine alone can abate roughly 
81 percent of embodied emissions relative to the 
current baseline (Exhibit 4). 

Top embodied levers for this archetype were 
classified into the four categories—design 
optimization, on-site improvements, material 
substitution, and process decarbonization—and 
applied sequentially. 

Design optimization levers
In the design phase, one lever stood out as 
particularly effective in decreasing embodied 
emissions: 

Increase adoption of design for manufacturing  
and assembly (DFMA) and off-site construction. This 
lever explores the manufacturing, planning, design, 
fabrication, and assembly of building elements at an 
off-site location, such as a factory or plant.

This enables the speeding up of on-site construction 
through standardized design. As a result, lower net 
waste is generated. This has an abatement potential 
of up to 40 percent of the emissions released during 
on-site construction due to reduced waste from 
saving up to 30 percent of construction material 
as well as fewer truckloads needed to transport 
building materials to the construction site. Applying 
this lever for this archetype is expected to save up to 

2 percent of total material costs in 2023, making it 
cost-effective today.5 

Off-site construction is already widely used in both 
Europe and Asia but struggles to gain a foothold 
in North America because of a variety of potential 
factors, such as increased desire for customization 
in structures and a reluctance to use a single 
supplier to provide for all building needs.

5 Off-site processes (prefab, automated production to create precision pieces) can also help bring down costs of airtight envelope solutions 
that seal places where heating or cooling may leak from a building. These solutions can retroactively improve energy efficiency of existing 
structures but are currently expensive.

Material substitution levers
Companies can make effective material 
substitutions by replacing cement with SCMs, 
scaling up use of low-carbon insulation, and 
augmenting concrete and steel use with 
engineered wood.

Replace cement with fly ash. SCMs are used to 
substitute portland cement in concrete or clinker 
in cement to make concrete mixtures more 

economical, reduce permeability, increase strength, 
and reduce embodied emissions. Examples of SCMs 
include fly ash, ground-granulated blast-furnace 
slag (GGBFS), calcined clay, and recycled concrete. 
For instance, fly ash can be used to substitute up 
to 30 percent of ordinary portland cement (OPC) 
in concrete manufacturing. This has an abatement 
potential of up to 30 percent of overall emissions 
associated with concrete and is also cost-effective. 
For a multifamily dwelling, the cost of replacing 

21

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentcement with SCMs is expected to remain consistent 
with the cost of OPC in most locations, making this 
lever cost-effective today. By contrast, contractors 
intending to use fly ash must be careful because 
it retains moisture longer than OPC and therefore 
takes longer to dry. Expenditures on equipment 
and energy used to dry the material (as opposed 
to drying naturally) could negatively affect cost-
savings and abatement potential.

Replace cement with GGBFS. GGBFS, another 
SCM, is a by-product in ironmaking and can be 
used to substitute up to 50 percent of OPC cement 
in concrete or clinker in cement manufacturing. 
While using GGBFS has an abatement potential of 
up to 50 percent of overall emissions associated 
with concrete, its application is expected to 
increase costs  by up to 3 percent of total material 
costs by 2030.6 

Because both fly ash and GGBFS are by-products 
of using coal, the supply of these materials will likely 
dwindle as coal is phased out. Therefore, other 
SCMs, such as calcined clay-blended cement and 
fine-limestone filler, will have an increasingly large 
role to play in producing green cement.

There are other innovative solutions in the market 
to produce low-carbon concrete: one example is 
replacing carbon-intensive cement with lower-
carbon industrial waste or other materials; another 
is CO2 mineralization to abate approximately 70 to 
100 percent of emissions associated with concrete 
production. Although these solutions are not yet 
commercially mature, they are likely to be widely 
available by 2030.

Scale the use of low-carbon insulation. Insulations 
are used in both home and commercial applications 
and can be made from conventional materials 
(such as stone mineral wool, glass mineral wool, 
or polystyrene), bio-based sources (such as wood 
fibers, hemp fibers, or cotton fibers), or recycled 
paper products (such as newspaper or cardboard). 
Conventional insulation typically has energy-

intensive manufacturing processes that can result 
in a relatively high emissions footprint depending on 
the technology used. 

First, low-carbon conventional insulation can be 
developed by using an increased proportion of 
recycled materials in its composition as well as 
by improving manufacturing processes through 
electrification, renewable energy, process 
improvements, and so on to lower fossil-fuel and 
energy use. This can abate emissions associated 
with the production of conventional insulation by 
up to 90 percent and can be relatively cost-neutral. 
Second, using recycled paper–based insulation 
(such as blown-in cellulose) has the potential to 
abate emissions associated with the production 
process by up to 90 percent. Applying this lever for 
this archetype is expected to be cost comparable 
to conventional insulation, making it cost-effective 
today. And third, using natural-fiber insulation can 
also abate emissions associated with the production 
process by up to 90 percent, though the cost 
of materials is likely too high today for this to be 
feasibly scaled in the near future. If industrialized, 
however, natural-fiber insulation could present a 
financially attractive opportunity, reducing overall 
costs to be comparable to the costs of conventional 
insulation, making it cost-effective by 2030.

While reducing embodied emissions for insulation 
is important, it is only one aspect of how insulation 
affects the environment. Most insulation, regardless 
of what material is used, can reduce the operational 
emissions of a building by reducing energy use 
for heating and cooling. Therefore, it is critical to 
consider the full life cycle of emissions for insulation 
materials when making choices about their design, 
material, and production to avoid suboptimal 
outcomes such as shorter life cycles and inadequate 
thermal performance, among other potential 
negative effects. 

Augment concrete and steel use with engineered 
wood. Though most of the concrete used in 
foundations and infrastructure cannot be 

6 The cost of GGBFS and fly ash is highly dependent on regional availability. Where both materials are plentiful, they are often similar in price. 
As use of coal continues to dwindle in steel manufacturing and power plants, both materials will likely become difficult to source. However, 
there is a large quantity of fly ash that is already produced and stored, which should keep prices lower for longer.

22

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentreplaced, there are proven designs for residential 
and commercial buildings that enable replacing 
a significant portion of concrete and steel in 
construction with engineered wood. An example 
of engineered wood that can be used is cross-
laminated timber (CLT), which is a large-scale, 
prefabricated, solid-engineered wood panel that 
is both lightweight and strong. Another example of 
engineered wood is glue-laminated timber (glulam), 
which consists of layers of dimensional lumber 
bound together with durable, moisture-resistant 
structural adhesives. 

These and other products, such as laminated 
veneer lumber (LVL) and mass ply panel (MPP), have 
many different applications in the engineered-wood 
space. Innovations in material use and production 
continue to progress, and new products are made 
available each year. Each of these can be evaluated 
for their sustainable sourcing strategy, performance 
attributes, and waste created during production.

By reducing the use of concrete and steel and 
substituting it with engineered wood in this 
archetype, it is possible to abate the embodied 
emissions associated with these materials. 
Given the existing emissions baseline for steel 
and concrete, use of engineered wood has an 
abatement potential of up to 40 percent but is 
currently limited by resource availability. Applying 
this lever for this archetype is expected to increase 
costs by up to 1 percent of total material costs by 
2030, making it marginally more expensive by 
2030, if industrialized.

On-site improvement levers 
Once construction moves on-site, multifamily 
dwellings can substantially decarbonize with the 
following lever:

Electrify on-site heavy equipment and small 
generators. Using electric construction equipment 
instead of internal-combustion-engine (ICE) 
equipment has an abatement potential of up 
to 90 percent for heavy-equipment emissions, 
assuming the use of renewable electric sources. 

7 Waste that is derived from organic plant or animal sources.

The abatement this lever achieves is a result of 
reducing fossil-fuel usage. Applying this lever for 
this archetype is expected to be cost-neutral by 
2030—that is, not contributing any material cost. 
As such, this lever could be cost-effective by 2030, 
if industrialized.

Primary process decarbonization levers 
Among the process decarbonization levers that 
were successfully applied to this archetype, three 
stood out: utilizing biomass7 as alternative fuel; 
upgrading and electrifying production of recycled 
construction steel; and carbon capture, utilization, 
and storage (CCUS) in cement production.

Utilize biomass as alternative fuel. Replacing 
coal used in cement production with biomass as 
the primary fuel can enable abatement of up to 
20 percent of emissions during cement production. 
Applying this lever for this archetype is expected to 
increase costs by up to 1 percent of total material 
costs by 2030, making it marginally more expensive 
by 2030, if industrialized. Biomass is already widely 
used in many parts of the world but has struggled 
to gain a foothold in North America. Easy access 
to relatively inexpensive natural gas likely limits the 
appetite to fully explore biomass as an alternative 
fuel source in this geography. 

Upgrade and electrify production of recycled 
construction steel. The original method of modern 
steel production is to use blast furnaces, which heat 
purified coal, limestone, and iron ore. The mixture 
is then injected with oxygen to diminish the carbon 
content and remove impurities before finished 
steel is produced. Arc furnaces, on the other 
hand, produce steel using mainly recycled steel 
and electricity. Switching to an arc furnace has an 
abatement potential of up to 50 percent of overall 
steel emissions for blast furnace–basic oxygen 
furnace (BF-BOF) producers. Additional actions, 
such as primarily using scrap steel and switching 
to a renewable energy source to operate the arc 
furnace can reduce emissions by an additional 45 
percent, for a total of 95 percent reduced emissions. 
Applying this lever for this archetype is expected 

23

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentUsing the levers that are expected 
to be cost-effective by 2030 could 
abate nearly one-third of embodied 
emissions for this archetype.

to be cost-neutral by 2030 for BF-BOF producers, 
with increased efficiencies from the furnace 
offsetting higher costs in energy. 

embodied emissions for the multifamily residential 
archetype (Exhibit 5). 

For producers already using direct reduced iron–
electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) technology, using 
scrap steel as the primary input and switching 
to a renewable energy source has an abatement 
potential of up to 45 percent of overall steel 
emissions. Applying this lever for this archetype 
is expected to increase costs by up to 3 percent 
of total material costs by 2030 for DRI-EAF 
producers. As such, this could be marginally more 
expensive by 2030, if industrialized.

Capture carbon in cement production. This lever 
relies on capturing and absorbing the CO2 created 
in the cement production process using a chemical 
solvent, which is typically amine-based, such as 
compounds of ethanolamine. Other technologies 
include solid ab- or adsorption, membrane ab- or 
adsorption, and oxyfuel combustion. If optimally 
implemented, carbon capture has an abatement 
potential of up to 90 percent8 of emissions 
associated with cement production. However, 
applying this lever for this archetype is expected 
to increase costs by up to 15 percent of total 
material costs by 2030, making it significantly more 
expensive by 2030. 

Based on our analysis, using the levers that are 
either cost-effective today or expected to be cost-
effective by 2030 could abate nearly one-third of 

Top levers to abate operational emissions
Total operational emissions for an average 
multifamily residential building in North America 
are approximately 2.2 metric tons of CO2 annually, 
with most emissions being driven by space heating 
(approximately 1.1 metric tons or 50 percent) and 
water heating (approximately 0.5 metric tons or 
22 percent) (Exhibit 6).

Of the 1,000 levers assessed, 11 levers were found 
to be most relevant in this specific case (Exhibit 7). 
Applying these levers to the multifamily residential 
archetype, we see that the top 11 levers can enable 
abatement of up to 90 percent of operational 
emissions relative to its current baseline, given 
100 percent renewable electricity from off- and 
on-site sources. 

Nine of these levers are explored below. Top 
operational levers for this archetype were 
categorized into four groups: space heating and 
cooling, water heating, cooking, and appliances 
and lighting. 

Space heating and cooling levers  
In the space heating and cooling category, 
technologies such as heat pumps,9 smart 
thermostats, and high-efficiency insulation can 
effectively decrease operational emissions. We 
expand on five of these levers below:

8 Referring to a baseline of all direct emissions (Scope 1) in cement production, such as those that arise from chemical reactions as well as 

fuel combustion.

9 Although we do not explore the embodied emissions associated with the production of heat pumps, it is important to discuss the use 

of refrigerants. Natural refrigerants (CO2, ammonium, and ammonia) and hydrofluoroolefins (HFO) are associated with greatly reduced 
emissions, compared with hydrofluorocarbons, the most used type of refrigerant, and should be used whenever safe design allows. Proper 
installation and observation of operational best practices should also help prevent leakage of refrigerants and unintended emissions. In 
addition, existent heat pumps containing more emissive refrigerants could be retrofitted or replaced with less emissive refrigerants.

Use heat pumps for heating. As previously 
mentioned, heat pumps use refrigerant and 
electricity to transfer heat from outdoor air or the 
ground to the inside of a building, even in colder 
temperatures.10 According to prior research by 
McKinsey, today’s models are 2.2 to 4.5 times more 
efficient than gas furnaces.11 Applying this lever 
to this archetype has the potential to abate up to 
60 percent of emissions associated with space 
heating. This lever is ROI positive today.

Use heat pumps for cooling. Heat pumps can 
similarly be used for cooling purposes. They are 
built with reversing valves which makes it possible 
to change the direction of heat transfer. Applying 
this lever to this archetype has the potential to abate 
up to 10 percent of emissions associated with space 
cooling. This lever is ROI positive today.

Use smart thermostats. Smart thermostats are 
part of a building’s energy-management system. 
Using heat pumps in combination with smart 
thermostats can help lower GHG emissions

insulation can often outweigh the emissions 
footprint associated with the production of 
conventional insulation. Lowering a building’s 
embodied emissions with low-carbon, high-
efficiency insulation also increases operational 
effectiveness through reduced use of energy 
and a lower emissions footprint. Some types 
of conventional insulation materials also tend 
to have better thermal performance relative to 
natural-fiber insulation. Applying this lever to 
this archetype has the potential to abate up to 
30 percent of remaining space heating emissions. 
This lever is ROI positive today. 

Install new district heating facilities. District 
systems reduce greenhouse emissions by heating 
multiple buildings with hot water from a central 
plant. Applying this lever to this archetype can 
abate up to 100 percent of remaining space heating 
emissions. However, given the realities of current 
urban planning in North America, it is unlikely this 
efficiency can be captured. For countries in the 
Middle East and for Singapore, however, this is a 
lever that can be considered.

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentEmissions from water heating can 
be most effectively abated by using 
alternative heating technologies, 
particularly heat pumps.

Water heating levers
Emissions from water heating can be most 
effectively abated by using alternative heating 
technologies, particularly heat pumps:

Appliances and lighting levers 
Many types of readily available technology can 
significantly reduce emissions in this category. 
Below, we explore two such levers:

Heat water using heat pumps. Heat pumps can be 
used to heat water, either as a stand-alone water 
heating system or as a combination water heating 
and space conditioning system. Applying this lever 
to this archetype has the potential to abate up to 
60 percent of overall water heating emissions (with 
an annual baseline of 0.5 metric tons of CO2e). 
These are the emissions that arise from using 
traditional water heating methods. This lever is ROI 
positive today.

Cooking levers
For cooking, replacing gas stoves with induction 
cooktops can reduce a sizeable proportion of 
emissions:

Use induction cooking. This is a method of cooking 
that uses a copper coil underneath the cooking 
surface to generate electromagnetic energy. Thus, 
instead of burning methane gas and emitting GHGs 
such as CO2, induction stoves run on electricity, 
which can be generated from clean, emission-free 
sources. Applying this lever to this archetype has 
the potential to abate up to 30 percent of overall 
cooking emissions. This lever is ROI positive today.

Use LED and smart lights. Replacing traditional 
light bulbs with more-efficient LEDs plus smart 
capability has significant potential to reduce 
emissions. In a given application, LEDs normally use 
less power compared to traditional light sources 
such as halogen and fluorescent. Because the 
overall kilowatt-per-hour consumption is less, this 
helps reduce overall CO2 emissions. Applying this 
lever to this archetype has an abatement potential 
of up to 90 percent of overall lighting emissions. 
This lever is ROI positive today.

Use refrigerators with ENERGY STAR ratings. 
Replacing traditional refrigerators with ones that 
have earned the ENERGY STAR label has the 
potential to reduce CO2 emissions by more than 
four metric tons12 over the lifetime of the product. 
Applying this lever to this archetype has an 
abatement potential of up to 20 percent of  
overall refrigeration emissions. This lever is ROI 
positive today.

Using only the levers across the four categories 
that are ROI positive today and expected to be ROI 
positive by 2030 if industrialized, it is possible to

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentabate roughly 70 percent of operational emissions 
for the multifamily residential archetype (Exhibit 8). 
Thus, multifamily residential buildings and other 
similar archetypes can get most of the way to net-
zero emissions while generating a positive ROI.

Archetype 2: Large infrastructure 
project in Europe in a cold climate
Large infrastructure projects are typically related 
to infrastructure assets such as roads, bridges, 
or ports. For this analysis, we considered a road 
network project in Europe as our baseline. This 
infrastructure project was estimated to have an 
embodied emissions baseline of approximately 

1.2 million to 1.5 million metric tons, estimated from a 
material composition and weight baseline of about 
7.0 million metric tons. Maintenance and repair of 
infrastructure typically constitutes a relatively small 
portion of overall emissions and is included in the 
baseline for this archetype.

Though the cost and abatement potential for 
the levers applied are based on a European 
infrastructure project, the results are mostly valid 
for other regions, with some nuances. Therefore, 
the recommended levers are reasonably applicable 
for infrastructure archetypes in other geographies 
and climates.

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentTo assess the composition of the archetype,  
we developed an emissions baseline rooted in  
the project’s embodied emissions. Since 
operational emissions directly associated with this 
infrastructure archetype would be low or negligible 
(other than the transportation-related emissions 
from vehicles using the roads), these were not 
considered for evaluating abatement potential. 
In addition, there are many potential levers for 
the transportation industry to use to decarbonize 
emissions related to the use of infrastructure 
(such as transitioning fuel-operated fleets to 
electric vehicles [EVs]). However, because these 
emissions are not considered to be part the built 
environment, the corresponding decarbonization 
levers are not the focus of this report.  

Top levers to abate embodied emissions
The embodied emissions baseline for a large 
infrastructure project was estimated to be about 
1.2 million to 1.5 million metric tons of CO2, with 
most emissions driven by steel (about 30 percent) 
and concrete (about 25 percent) (Exhibit 9). 

We assessed more than 70 levers and classified 
them into the same four categories as the 
previous archetype: design optimization, on-site 
improvements, material substitution, and process 
decarbonization (Exhibit 10). Applying these levers 
to the infrastructure archetype, we see that the 
top nine levers can enable abatement of up to 
55 percent of embodied emissions relative to its 
current baseline.

Design optimization levers  
For large infrastructure projects, value engineering 
can reduce demand for both concrete and steel in 
the following ways:

Value engineering to decrease concrete demand. 
Concrete manufacturing is the second-largest 
contributor of embodied emissions for this 
archetype, contributing about 300,000 metric tons 
of CO2e to overall emissions during construction 
of a structure that weighs approximately seven 
million metric tons. Value engineering, such as 
better structural design, has been proved to

result in significant concrete savings through 
lean construction. Lean construction refers to 
the process of designing production systems 
in a construction environment with the goal of 
decreasing material waste. It is estimated that up to 
5 percent of concrete can be saved through value 
engineering, specifically by single-shell tunnel 
construction methods, which effectively minimize 

the use of concrete. It is expected to reduce costs 
by up to 1 percent of total material costs, making this 
lever cost-effective today.

Value engineering to decrease steel demand. 
Steel manufacturing is the largest contributor of 
embodied emissions for this archetype, contributing 
approximately 30 percent of overall emissions 

31

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentduring construction. Better structural design 
through lean construction can result in significant 
steel savings that can lower emissions. According 
to research published by McKinsey,13 prioritizing 
efficiency in construction materials and design is a 
no-regret move that would lower both material and 
construction costs. By implementing single-shell 
construction methods, we estimate that 5 percent 
of steel can be saved. Similarly to value engineering 
to decrease concrete demand, this lever is expected 
to reduce material costs by up to 1 percent and is 
cost-effective today.

Material substitution levers 
Infrastructure projects can be decarbonized by 
using less-emission-intensive materials, as in the 
following levers:

Replace aggregate in asphalt with recycled 
concrete aggregate, and replace bitumen 
in asphalt with lignin. Asphalt production is 
a significant driver of embodied emissions, 
contributing 35,000 to 40,000 metric tons 
of overall emissions during construction of an 
average large infrastructure project. By recycling 
concrete and using the resulting aggregate—
recycled concrete aggregate, or RCA—in asphalt, 
producers can reduce their GHG emissions, among 
other environmental benefits. Replacing bitumen, 
the traditional binder in asphalt, with lignin can 
also lower GHG emissions. Lignin can be produced 
at much lower temperatures than bitumen, so 
much less energy is required in its manufacturing 
process. By applying this lever, it is possible 
to abate up to 40 percent of overall emissions 
associated with asphalt production. Applying this 
lever for this archetype is expected to save up to 
1 percent of total material costs, making this lever 
cost-effective today.

On-site improvements levers  
Two levers for on-site improvements prove 
particularly effective for this archetype:

Electrify heavy equipment. The use of electrified 
equipment will necessitate the additional 
installation of mobile-charging infrastructure, 
but with this lever, it is possible to abate up to 
7 percent of all heavy-equipment emissions. 
This lever is applicable to one-third of crawler 
cranes, 1,000-metric-ton cranes, piling rigs, 
and continuous flight auger (CFA) crawler-
mounted rigs. Although leasing electrified heavy 
equipment from vendors can result in an increase 
of 10 percent in lease prices, the price of fuel 
consumption can decrease by up to 60 percent. 
Combined, these factors result in an expected 
reduction in material costs of up to 1 percent, 
making this lever cost-effective today.

Use renewable natural gas as fuel for heavy 
equipment. Renewable natural gas (RNG), or 
biogas, is produced by anaerobically decomposing 
organic material. Leasing liquefied natural gas– and 
RNG-capable equipment from vendors can lead to 
an estimated 20 percent increase in lease price and 
a 50 percent increase in fuel consumption price. 
At the same time, applying this lever can abate 
an additional 23 percent of all heavy-equipment 
emissions when it is applied with the previous 
lever, for a combined total of 30 percent of heavy-
equipment emissions. This lever is applicable to all 
equipment. Applying this lever for this archetype 
is expected to increase costs by up to 3 percent of 
total material costs by 2030. Thus, we categorize 
this lever as marginally more expensive by 2030,  
if industrialized.

13  “Net-zero steel in building and construction: The way forward,” McKinsey, April 28, 2022.

32

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentBoth archetypes have significant 
embodied emissions, but the 
potential to abate embodied 
emissions varies between them.

Primary process decarbonization levers 
Among effective process decarbonization levers, 
one is uniquely applicable to this archetype:

Use inert anodes to reduce emissions from 
anode breakdown and switch to green electricity 
in aluminum smelter. Aluminum production 
is a significant driver of embodied emissions, 
contributing roughly 5 percent of CO2 to overall 
emissions during infrastructure construction. The 
smelting of aluminum during production is a highly 
energy-intensive electrolytic process that relies 
on passing electric energy through an anode that 
is dipped into an iron vessel containing aluminum 
oxide. This releases molten aluminum that can be 
further processed. By replacing standard carbon 
anodes with inert, nonconsumable materials, such 
as ceramics or alloys, emissions from this smelting 
process can be reduced by preventing the 
formation of CO2 and only releasing pure oxygen as 
a by-product. Applying this lever to this archetype 
has an abatement potential of up to 30 percent 
of overall emissions associated with aluminum. 
However, it is also expected to increase costs by 
up to 0.5 percent of total material costs by 2030, 
making it marginally more expensive by 2030, if 
industrialized.

In addition, three other process decarbonization 
levers are as effective in the large infrastructure 
archetype as they are in the multifamily dwelling 
archetype: utilizing biomass as alternative fuel, 
upgrading and electrifying production of recycled 
construction steel, and using carbon capture in 
cement production.

Using only the levers that are cost-effective 
today and expected to be cost-effective by 2030 
if industrialized across the four categories, it is 

possible to abate roughly 10 percent of embodied 
emissions for this archetype (Exhibit 11). 

Overall takeaways
By comparing these two archetypes, we can see a 
number of important findings. 

Both the multifamily dwelling archetype and 
the large infrastructure project archetype have 
significant embodied emissions, but the potential 
to abate embodied emissions varies between them. 
For the multifamily dwelling, it is possible to abate 
about one-third of all embodied emissions by using 
levers that are cost-effective today and expected 
to be cost-effective by 2030. On the other hand, 
for the large infrastructure project, it is possible 
to abate approximately 10 percent of all embodied 
emissions by applying similar levers. This is primarily 
due to the different material makeup and scale of 
these archetypes: the infrastructure project has a 
greater composition of materials (such as cement 
and steel) that are much more challenging to 
abate, and it requires substantially larger and more 
emissive machinery during construction. 

Still, the levers outlined above represent a real 
opportunity to lower the overall embodied 
emissions of the built environment. Recall that 
embodied emissions represent close to one-third 
of all built-environment emissions. Given that 
infrastructure represents about one-third of all 
embodied emissions, with the other two-thirds 
coming from residential and commercial buildings, 
this would indicate that (using a weighted average) 
it is possible to abate close to 10 percent of overall 
emissions associated with the built environment  
by applying embodied-emissions levers that 
are cost-effective today or expected to be cost-
effective by 2030.

Operational emissions provide another informative 
point of comparison between these two 
archetypes. As noted above, large infrastructure 
projects are considered to not have operational 
emissions, whereas about two-thirds of the 
total emissions of the multifamily dwelling are 
operational. It is possible to abate roughly 70 
percent of all operational emissions for the 
multifamily dwelling by using levers that are ROI 
positive today and expected to be ROI positive by 
2030. These figures can be extrapolated to other 
residential and commercial building archetypes. 
Considering that operational emissions represent 
about two-thirds of all built-environment emissions 
and that residential and commercial buildings 

represent close to 90 percent of all those 
emissions, there is significant opportunity to abate 
close to 40 percent of overall emissions associated 
with the built environment by applying operational-
emissions levers that are ROI positive today or 
expected to be ROI positive by 2030. 

Our analysis draws attention to many of the 
most impactful levers to decarbonize the built 
environment. However, there are other mechanisms 
and solutions with potential to increase the 
impact of these levers but that are either cost-
prohibitive or face barriers to industrialization. 
One such mechanism is circularity in the materials 
value chain—that is, redesigning, reducing, and 

34

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentrepurposing structures and materials to increase 
decarbonization. Such circular technologies 
include alternative fuels, carbon curing, and more. 
If these technologies are scaled, they could help 
to decarbonize roughly 80 percent of cement 
and concrete emissions by 2050.14 Based on 

our estimates and expected carbon prices, each 
of these technologies is expected to be value-
positive by 2050 but face challenges in scaling and 
industrializing in the near to medium term.

Business opportunities  
with a potential to generate 
significant value  

Unlocking barriers and accelerating 
the adoption of abatement technology 
can potentially fuel hundreds of 
billions of dollars’ worth of business 
opportunities across the value chain. 

There are multiple pathways to cost-effective 
decarbonization for the built environment. The 
world could abate up to half of total emissions at 
no net cost and without any green premiums or 
other incentives. Many levers discussed in the 
previous chapter, such as heat pumps and smart 
thermostats, are economically and technically 
viable today. However, some levers, such as utilizing 
biomass as an alternative fuel, need industrialization 
to achieve no net cost. By scaling levers that are not 
yet cost-effective through industrialization, an even 
larger share of total emissions could be abated in 
the following years—up to 80 percent.  

The push for deep renovations of existing buildings 
in the European Union gives a sense of the size 
of the opportunities. The European Union’s Fit 
for 55 targets for deep renovation encourage 
individuals and organizations to improve heating 
and cooling efficiency, which could be done by 
updating windows and walls, roofs, and basement 
insulation, for instance.15 To reach these goals, the 
Buildings Performance Institute Europe (BPIE), a 
not-for-profit organization, estimates that the rate 
of renovations may need to increase 15 times the 
current average of 0.2 percent.16 This could increase 

the insulation service sector to about 1.5 million 
workers and to a total potential market size in the 
European Union of $175 billion by 2030. 

Accelerating adoption and removing current 
barriers to adoption can fuel hundreds of billions 
of dollars’ worth of business opportunities across 
the value chain in producing, distributing, or 
building with these materials and technologies. 
Large-scale adoption of these levers would require 
unlocking structural, geographic, value chain, and 
skill barriers, as well as specific barriers such as 
investment flow and technology advancement.

Creating a more collaborative 
ecosystem
For most opportunities to be fully realized, 
collaboration among ecosystem players will likely be 
critical. First, established or existing players could 
expand their offerings to produce new materials, 
technologies, or services. We call such companies 
solution providers. Second, solution providers could 
benefit from real estate owners and investors, 
developers, construction companies, or other users 
committing to adopting their products and services 
at a significant scale. Third, financiers would likely 
have to invest in scaling production, deployment, 
and adoption, such as by financing asset owners 
to pay for retrofits and new technology. Together, 
this ecosystem can serve as the driving force to get 
new green materials, technologies, and services 
operational and cost-effective. 

Although creating this ecosystem may appear 
daunting, the demand, capital, and producers exist

16 “Refurbishing Europe: Igniting opportunities in the built environment,” McKinsey, February 28, 2023.

37

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmenttoday. As we have already discussed, many levers 
are cost-effective today or could be soon, making 
them ideal targets for launching and scaling. 

Ecosystem players have an opportunity to 
generate value and, at the same time, contribute 
to the net-zero transition. While some of these 
opportunities can be captured in isolation, most 
are likely to require new ways of collaboration. 
Moreover, industrialization is not a zero-sum game; 
partnerships across the value chain, even among 
competitors, stand to benefit the entire ecosystem. 
To accelerate production of new technology 
and materials in today’s fragmented ecosystem, 
partnerships can enable scale to achieve financial 
viability and make unit costs commercially 
comparable to conventional solutions. Partners 
can also share the burden of testing and evaluating 
new solutions across peers while simultaneously 
reducing the individual risk for peers adopting 
industry-wide solutions requiring significant 
investments.

In these promising times, players have the 
opportunity to act to accelerate what is cost-
effective now and industrialize what will be 
cost-effective by 2030. Out of all the business 
opportunities we have analyzed across every 
archetype, we focus on the largest 17 discrete 
opportunities, each of which could have significant 
value potential (Exhibit 12). The business 
opportunities we examine are by no means 
exhaustive, but by focusing on these 17, ecosystem 
players would be likely to make the most impact  
on lowering emissions and decarbonizing the  
built environment.

1. Industrialize production 
of green materials
Existing production processes for construction 
materials, such as cement and steel, are highly 
emissive. Opportunities in this space include 
decarbonizing production processes for existing 
materials and increasing the production of new 
green-material alternatives, such as low-carbon 
insulation and engineered wood.  

Produce low-carbon cement with new 
or retrofitted cement plants 
There are several decarbonization business 
opportunities for cement manufacturers, the first 
of which has to do with the cement production 
process. Fossil-fuel combustion (primarily coal) is 
used to fuel the precalciners and kilns in cement 
plants. This represents approximately 40 percent of 
cement production emissions.17  

Fortunately, at no or little cost, biomass and waste 
can be substituted for coal to begin decarbonizing 
the cement production process. Some cement 
kilns already operate using more than 90 percent 
alternative fuels.18 In the European Union, large 
cement manufacturers have committed to reducing 
their emissions per metric ton of cement by 
20 percent from a 2020 baseline through thermal-
energy efficiency, fuel switching, and clinker 
substitution.19 According to S&P, this can be done at 
a reasonable cost.20  

As a result, there is an opportunity for large, 
comprehensive waste-management firms to 
collect and source biomass for cement production, 
particularly in certain regions. Biomass is the main 
source of renewable energy in the European Union21 
but contributes less than 5 percent of renewable 
energy in the United States.22 This less-mature 
biomass market and others like it are open to

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentcement producers and waste management looking 
to form mutually beneficial offtake agreements. 

Another decarbonization opportunity comes 
from retrofitting cement production plants with 
CCUS and from upgrading older cement plants 
with the latest, most efficient capabilities. CCUS 
technologies are rapidly advancing across 
industries, and several pilot studies have proved 
the technical viability of CCUS in cement plants. 
For example, the world’s first CO2-capture facility 
at a cement plant, Heidelberg’s facility in Brevik, 
Norway, is projected to be fully operational  
in 2024.23  

The average cement production plant in North 
America is approximately 50 percent older than 
that of Asia–Pacific,24 meaning there are many 
opportunities in the region to retrofit or replace 
older plants with CCUS and the latest conventional 
and commercially proven technologies. These 
retrofits might involve replacing outdated wet-
process kilns with dry-process kilns (including 
staged preheaters and precalciners) and efficient 
grinding equipment, which could greatly improve 
energy and thermal efficiencies.25 This would 
increase the cement produced per unit of energy, 
thereby reducing both emissions and the cost per 
unit of cement. As a result, such retrofitting could 
provide a cost-effective opportunity to decarbonize 
cement production. 

Fine-limestone filler is another SCM option that has 
been extensively quarried, and therefore, supply is 
expected to be stable in several regions. Cement 
and concrete firms could set up or expand concrete-
mixing businesses that maximize the amount of 
low-carbon cement and clinkers that are allowed, 
cost-feasible, and technically sound. 

Modern grinding technologies allow much more 
precise separation of waste concrete components 
than in the past. This makes upcycling waste 
concrete as a filler or SCM a promising opportunity 
for concrete producers, given the scale of 
materials available. Cement manufacturers can 
also use upcycled concrete as clinker raw material. 
The European Union is expected to allow using 
recycled concrete as the main component in 
cement in 2023.26 Given the carbon tax on CO2 
emissions from cement, the European Union could 
be an attractive market for upcycled concrete 
waste in cement production. 

To accelerate the opportunity from waste concrete, 
waste management firms could play a role in the 
supply chain by sourcing and distributing clinker 
substitutes, such as fly ash and GGBFS, from steel 
and coal-fired power plants and recycled concrete 
from demolition sites. In addition, suppliers could 
develop partnerships and offtake agreements with 
cement producers to guarantee material use. 

Scale up low-carbon concrete production
Beyond technological advancements to improve 
the cement production process, cement producers 
can also reduce emissions by using more 
environmentally friendly SCMs such as fly ash and 
GGBFS to make concrete. Given that the availability 
of these two SCMs is likely to decline going forward 
in many regions, producers may need to increase 
their adoption of other techniques. One option is 
using calcined clay-blended cement, which is a 
cost-effective SCM that requires production scaling. 

Concrete could be further decarbonized at no 
additional cost with carbon curing. In carbon 
curing, CO2 is added before the concrete cures 
to reduce the amount of cement needed without 
compromising structural strength. The CO2 used 
in the process could even be captured from earlier 
phases of cement production with carbon capture 
technologies. These opportunities could help 
concrete producers meet increasing demand for 
low-carbon concrete from developers, real estate 
investors, construction companies, and builders 
seeking to reduce their carbon footprints.

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentProduce green construction steel
A number of levers exist for steel producers to 
lower their emissions while making construction 
steel. First, steel producers can significantly reduce 
emissions by shifting to DRI-EAF steel production 
and using scrap feedstock, which has proved to be 
both technically and commercially viable. Second, 
existing DRI-EAF plants can be optimized using 
renewable energy sources, such as green hydrogen, 
instead of natural gas. While the high cost of green 
hydrogen currently acts as a barrier, rising carbon 
costs and the anticipated decrease in green-
hydrogen costs in the future would help facilitate the 
transition. Third, steel producers and smelters can 
look into integrating CCUS technology throughout 
their processes. For example, a carbon capture pilot 
for smelters is now connected to a steel plant in Mo i 
Rana, Norway.27  

The opportunity for steel producers to retrofit 
construction steel plants to produce green steel 
could tactically be achieved through partnerships 
between steel producers; alternative-fuel providers; 
and engineering, procurement, and construction 
(EPC) firms specializing in developing leading 
green technologies. These partnerships could be 
particularly beneficial for EPC firms, given that 
steel plants moving to low-emissions production 
could require $164 billion dollars in annual capital 
spending by 2030.28   

As an example of one type of partnership, cement 
and steel producers could partner across the value 
chain with alternative-fuel providers to set price and 
quantity offtake agreements to ensure continuous 
markets for each other’s products. This type of 
agreement is common in industries looking to 
decarbonize fuel usage. 

signed a green hydrogen offtake agreement with 
Jindal Stainless. The deal will see Hygenco build, 
own, and operate a multimegawatt green-hydrogen 
facility for 20 years,29 which will help Jindal Stainless 
reduce its carbon emissions by 2,700 metric tons 
annually. Vertex Hydrogen, a part of the Essar Group, 
has signed a “heads of terms” offtake agreement for 
more than 200 megawatts of low-carbon hydrogen 
with Tata Chemicals Europe.30 And Neste has an 
offtake agreement to supply 320,000 metric tons of 
hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) biojet 
fuel to DHL over the next five years.31 

Another tactic to increase the ease and efficiency 
of decarbonizing would be to develop hydrogen 
and CCUS hubs. Clustering steel, cement, and 
other high-emitting industries into these hubs 
could unlock and accelerate the deployment of 
hydrogen and CCUS. It allows organizations to 
share specialized expertise, services, resources, 
suppliers, and infrastructure. It could also decrease 
the risks inherent in deploying and scaling these 
technologies and could spread high up-front capital 
expenditures across peers and other high-emitting 
industries. For example, HyNet North West UK, 
an industrial cluster project, includes Hanson 
Padeswood Cement Works as part of its hydrogen 
and carbon capture and storage cluster.32 

Clustering industries is already common practice. 
The European Union has 1,500 industrial clusters, 
accounting for almost a quarter of total EU 
employment.33 Since the founding of the 2021 World 
Economic Forum initiative Transitioning Industrial 
Clusters towards Net Zero, which seeks to help 
industries reduce emissions, 17 industrial clusters 
from around the globe have joined.34   

A number of companies in the space have already 
taken steps to form partnerships. Hygenco India has

industries further. For instance, the US Bipartisan

industrial production.35 The European Commission 
approved €5.2 billion for the hydrogen Hy2Use 
project.36 It includes 35 projects at 29 firms to 
build infrastructure for producing, storing, and 
transporting hydrogen and developing hydrogen 
applications for high-emissive industries such as 
steel and cement. 

Scale manufacturing of low-carbon insulation 
As producers of traditional construction materials 
start to decarbonize their processes, there are 
options for builders looking to immediately lower 
their emissions—in this case, using materials that are 
inherently less emissions-intensive. For example, 
using natural-fiber insulation or conventional low-
carbon insulation, made using a greater proportion 
of recycled materials, can abate a significant portion 
of embodied carbon emissions associated with 
conventional insulation at a reduced cost. 

Insulation manufacturers could scale production 
of high-efficiency conventional insulations that use 
a greater proportion of recycled materials in their 
composition. They could also improve production 
measures, such as by optimizing equipment use, 
using renewable energy sources, and implementing 
process improvements. Together, these actions can 
help lower fossil-fuel and energy use and thereby 
reduce their emissions footprint. 

Natural-fiber insulation has the potential to abate 
almost all emissions associated with the production 
process. However, the limited supply of raw inputs 
and the high price for natural-fiber insulation 
compared to conventional insulation are significant 
constraints that currently prevent widespread 
adoption. By establishing agreements with farmers 
and foresters to procure the required amounts of 
raw materials and by industrializing production 
processes to lower costs by 2030, producers could 
potentially increase their manufacturing capacity of 
natural-fiber insulation offerings and become cost-
competitive with traditional insulation producers. 

Scale manufacturing of low-cost  
engineered wood
For many applications, engineered wood is a viable 
alternative to concrete and steel. Thus, developers 
can choose to use engineered wood to reduce 
emissions from steel and concrete while benefiting 
from the natural carbon sequestration of trees. 

For manufacturers, there is significant opportunity 
in ramping up the production of engineered wood 
(such as CLT, LVL, and MPP) by automating finger 
joining, layup and gluing, pressing, and other 
production processes. Given that many regions 
have limits on deforestation and the supply of 
verified, sustainable timber is limited, producers 
who can secure robust offtake agreements 
with verified sustainable-lumber producers and 
foresters will likely realize benefits. In the long term, 
leveraging smart and sustainable forestry practices 
can improve supply constraints. Producers will 
likely need to leverage multisourcing or vertical 
integration to diversify and ensure their supplier 
base. The final key to unlocking this market is 
access to the construction market via partnerships. 
Design and engineering (D&E) firms can establish 
standards for use, and developers can commit to 
offtake agreements to show demand, which could 
help derisk the investment by engineered-wood 
producers. While currently expensive, assurances 
over offtake of engineered wood can allow 
necessary investments to industrialize production 
and the supply chain to drive down the price barrier. 

2. Industrialize production of energy-
efficient building technology
The majority of built-environment emissions come 
from space cooling, space heating, and water 
heating. The principal lever for decarbonizing these 
forms of emissions is heat pumps, which can abate 
up to 60 percent of heating and cooling emissions 
for most building types. However, as of 2023, the 
heat pump supply chain is currently experiencing—
and may continue to experience—manufacturing 
and supply chain bottlenecks.

42

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentScale manufacturing of low-cost and 
high-efficiency heat pumps
There is opportunity to scale the production of heat 
pumps and related components by industrializing 
manufacturing, strengthening supply chains, and 
implementing operational excellence best practices. 
For the European Union to grow from 15 million heat 
pumps in 2021 to RePowerEU’s target of 54 million 
heat pumps by 2030, McKinsey estimates it would 
require 132 new assembly factories, each producing 
100,000 heat pumps annually.37  

Large appliance and commercial manufacturers, 
especially those seeking to invest in a high-
growth market, can benefit from this opportunity. 
Actionable measures include standardizing and 
optimizing designs, diversifying the supplier 
base, and vertically integrating the supply chain 
for large-scale heat pump subcomponents. 
Expanding design-to-value (DTV) techniques can 
also help reduce material usage, identify lower-
cost materials, and increase recycling. Residential 
heat pumps require 15 times more copper and 
brass than condensing gas boiler equivalents.38 
Using aluminum alternatives to copper for key 
components and increased recycling of copper, 
aluminum, iron, and components from scrapped 
HVAC equipment could alleviate supply chain 
bottlenecks while reducing costs and decarbonizing 
the supply chain because raw metals will not have 
to be mined.39 Using alternative refrigerants, such 
as low-emission ammonia or captured CO2, could 
further decarbonize and diversify the supply 
chain. Procuring and supplying these alternative 
components to heat pumps and related component 
manufacturers provides a unique opportunity that 
can be derisked by securing offtake agreements 
with major heat pump manufacturers and 
component suppliers.

3. Deliver efficient energy and 
electrification upgrades
Energy upgrade services are likely too fragmented 
and of insufficient scale to meet the hundreds of 
billions of dollars of annual demand required for 
decarbonization.40 Fragmentation across trades 
in the built environment can result in complex 
and time-consuming handovers. As a result, the 
responsibility of coordinating different trades, 
procurement, and administration often falls on 
building owners. Given how nascent some of 
the proposed energy optimization solutions are, 
creating a comprehensive energy upgrade service 
could generate significant value.  

Develop and offer energy upgrade 
installation services
There is opportunity for stakeholders to consolidate 
services to create integrated packages of key 
decarbonization solutions to ease the transaction 
costs of decarbonization upgrades. Operators 
of consolidated services could generate value 
by providing customers with a combination of 
energy audits, procurement plans to outline which 
green materials to use, installation services, and 
administrative support to navigate region-specific 
tax incentives to help customers maximize the 
energy cost savings of their buildings. After 
projects are complete, consortiums could manage 
construction waste material removal. Coordination 
of these services will likely vary by region but can 
save time and reduce costs across the board. The 
cost of net-zero consumables could be reduced 
by up to 30 percent through centralized digital 
procurement and other best practices, and the 
global market for potential retrofits could reach 
almost $1 trillion annually by 2035.41

43

Building value by decarbonizing the built environment4. Design and engineer both green 
and cost-effective structures
Conventional bespoke designs create costly 
material waste and rely on highly emissive materials 
such as cement and steel. Real estate and 
infrastructure owners, investors, and developers 
often rely on advice from D&E firms when they 
commission projects, but many D&E firms currently 
do not focus on optimizing designs for minimal 
emissions. As a result, there is opportunity for 
these firms to recommend innovative solutions and 
systematically evaluate the cost implications of 
alternative choices. 

Expand green and cost-effective design 
and engineering capabilities 
Builders can only implement green solutions if plans 
actually use low-carbon materials and technologies 
and are carefully scrutinized to minimize material 
use. Therefore, D&E firms will likely play an 
important role in driving decarbonization within 
the built environment by expanding their service 
offerings and cultivating their design capabilities 
to leverage green technologies. By creating a core 
design portfolio that incorporates green solutions, 
firms can help facilitate and spearhead the 
implementation of off-site construction via DFMA, 
engineered wood, green materials, and more. 
DFMA could enable firms to develop a database 
of prefabricated building components, limiting 
customization and enhancing modularity at the 
design stage. 

There are three tangible actions that D&E firms 
can take if they are keen on this opportunity. First, 
firms can develop and enhance the accuracy of their 
cost estimation tools to enable cleansheet designs 
using green materials (for example, by digitization). 
For instance, firms could create full and standard 
market-transparency tools to calculate lifetime 
emissions and cost implications of design decisions. 

Many designers don’t design buildings with lower 
operating emissions because buyers often do not 
incorporate that factor into how they value buildings 
and may not be willing to pay the premium on 
specifications. D&E firms can guide customers in 
the cost trade-offs between different designs and 
encourage customers to try the less well-beaten—
and lower-emissions—pathways. 

Second, firms can create a portfolio of optimized 
designs, possibly employing generative design, that 
minimizes waste, cost, and emissions by leveraging 
green solutions. This could equip builders with the 
tools to meet evolving client demands, such as net-
zero operational homes. 

Last, firms could deploy generative design AI to 
enhance the transition, given that it could allow 
builders to decarbonize their projects based on a 
specific set of criteria (costs, aesthetics, materials, 
and so on). Increased use of generative design and 
digitization may require changing the business 
model of some D&E firms from charging hourly rates 
to project-based fees because these technologies 
require up-front investment to implement (in 
other words, increased fixed costs). Companies, 
particularly developers, looking to decarbonize 
their construction projects could benefit from using 
these technologies.  

5. Electrify on-site construction
Emissions from on-site construction equipment 
only contribute a small portion of built-environment 
emissions. Still, electrification of construction 
equipment can be cost-effective by 2030 if 
industrialized, and major construction-equipment 
manufacturers continue to expand their offerings 
of electric construction equipment. For example, 
Volvo committed to level-set the price of electric 
machines with diesel by the mid-2020s,42 and 

42 “It’s time to launch our electric construction machines,” Volvo, accessed May 26, 2023.

44

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentCaterpillar even demonstrated a battery-powered 
large mining truck.43 

Build and scale electrified offerings and on-site 
charging infrastructure for equipment
OEMs have first-mover and scale advantages 
in developing electric construction equipment 
and improving existing battery technology. Many 
customers today could be willing to switch to this 
electric construction equipment but are tied to ICE 
equipment because of a lack of charging options 
in their operation locations. As a result, there is an 
opportunity in electrification logistics to build the 
charging infrastructure—particularly high-speed 
mobile charging stations—needed to support these 
electrified technologies. 

To build out the infrastructure more quickly, 
partnerships will likely be essential to expand 
the reach of charging-station services. These 
partnerships would potentially benefit both 
manufacturers of electric construction equipment 
and charging station companies, which could 
establish a steady stream of customers even in 
locations with low EV penetration while growing the 
market of construction companies, which are able 
to use EVs.

6. Minimize waste and maximize 
speed with off-site builds
Conventional on-site bespoke construction can 
create large amounts of waste materials since 
builders typically order most materials with an extra 
margin to avoid the risk of standing still. These 
margins can also make the process more costly and 
time intensive. By constructing buildings off-site, 
companies can reduce the size of this extra margin 
of materials since, in a factory setting, inventory can 
be made available across projects. 

Develop off-site (modular) solutions
Modular construction can be restricted by limited 
customization capacity and use cases, making 
it difficult to deploy in bespoke conventional 
construction projects. However, residential and 
commercial builders and investors with time- and 
cost-sensitive projects could take advantage of 
many of the benefits modular construction offers, 
such as more-efficient and automated processes 
that lead to shorter construction times and lower 
financial and labor costs. In fact, we estimate that 
off-site construction could help reduce construction 
time by approximately 20 percent44 and that 
modular construction in European and US markets 
can potentially create $22 billion in annual savings.45  

These incentives create exciting opportunities 
for companies looking to unlock the barriers 
to the large-scale deployment of modular 
construction solutions. Modular construction 
firms can industrialize processes for constructing 
modules, and D&E firms can develop a suite of 
modular solutions for developers focused on 
reducing waste and cost while increasing speed. 
To accelerate the adoption of these technologies, 
large real estate developers and builders could 
partner with D&E firms to identify optimized low-
waste modular design principles that could help 
reduce cost, timelines, waste, and emissions 
through standardization and design, such as by 
standardizing window and facade panels. For 
certain applications, parametric design can enable 
customization while standardizing modules. 
Offtake agreements and coordination with modular 
design firms could allow all parties to create 
use cases and determine how best to balance 
customization with efficiency. 

Scaling modular businesses would require a strong 
manufacturing skill set and a deep knowledge of 
regional differences. Players would likely have to 
navigate region-specific resource scarcity as well as 
complexities and remote conditions that can create

construction times.

45

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentchallenges for on-site construction. However, 
if these challenges can be addressed, modular 
solutions are projected to have highly cost-effective 
use cases.

7. Validate and certify low-
carbon actions and solutions
Establishing trustworthy and verifiable green 
credentials is crucial to scaling green solutions. 
Consumers of these solutions will need confidence 
in their efficacy and abatement potential to create 
demand or, in some cases, to pay a premium for 
these solutions. Verified credentials will likely create 
a stable demand scenario that could empower 
investors and entrepreneurs to scale these 
solutions confidently. Additionally, these credentials 
could provide opportunities to lower financing 
costs for these solutions thanks to the demand for 
green financial instruments and reduced risk from 
stranded assets.

Accurately verify and track emissions 
in the built environment
Today, taxes on carbon emissions and related 
programs, such as compliance and voluntary carbon 
markets, are in place in Europe, some US states, 
and Canada, with more expected. Of the 2,000 
largest global public companies, about 700 have 
made net-zero commitments.46 Many large real 
estate portfolio holders have net-zero targets, as 
well. To leverage these carbon taxes and credits 
and adhere to net-zero targets and commitments, 
players in the built environment ecosystem would 
have to reputably and defensibly account for the 
carbon emissions in their structures, products, 
operations, materials, and projects. 

Partnerships between auditing, environmental, and 
engineering firms could create offerings to measure 
emissions transparently and accurately over the 
life cycle of a given asset, while environmental 
and engineering professionals’ expertise will be 
needed to measure emissions. Audit professionals 

could provide the framework to create structures 
to comply with relevant regulations, standards, and 
best transparency and reporting practices. The rigor 
and accountability of adhering to generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will likely be 
required for the new emissions frameworks (such 
as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures), regardless of the framework. 

One way to facilitate these transparency services 
would be to provide reliable and detailed design 
libraries of carbon footprints of all materials and 
technologies in a structure. These standardized 
details would make it easier for developers to 
apply for net-zero and green building and structure 
certifications. This “carbon passport” would 
promote the use of new materials and technologies 
and could help small- and medium-size real 
estate investors and developers validate their 
decarbonization credentials. This could enable 
them to sell their assets at a premium to real estate 
investors decarbonizing their portfolios, get better 
loan rates from financial institutions decarbonizing 
their loan portfolios, and receive higher rent for 
commercial office spaces. Already, more-limited 
versions of sustainability ratings have been shown 
to increase rent by up to 6 percent.47 

Certify green materials and solutions
To be deployed, conventional construction materials 
and processes must meet quality standards that are 
transparent and accountable, and green materials 
are no different. Because green materials are 
novel in many cases, they often require enhanced 
assurances, given that historical use and tolerance 
precedents are not well established. 

Verifying sustainable material sourcing—for 
example, verifying that mass timber falls within 
the regulation limits for sustainable forestry—and 
corresponding abatement potentials provides 
credibility for pursuing carbon incentives and 
credits, green premiums, and large-scale adoption 
of green materials. These opportunities are

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentgood for both the environment and the economy 
because green products can have margins that are 
15 to 150 percent higher than their conventional 
counterparts.48 

To facilitate the verification process, new entrants 
and disruptors could create services to certify 
green materials. This could enable D&E firms to 
deploy materials in designs, insurers to insure green 
structures and projects, and developers to finance 
projects that use green materials. 

Train and certify green-solution providers
The IEA estimates that the demand for heat pump 
installers is expected to quadruple by 2030 to more 
than 850,000 and that 170,000 more workers need 
to be trained to maintain and service the additional 
heat pumps.49 This demand is not confined to heat 
pump installation: upskilled D&E professionals will 
likely be needed throughout the built-environment 
ecosystem to deploy green solutions. 

To fill the labor and skills gap, there is opportunity 
to establish and expand training academies and 
vocational institutes to upskill D&E professionals 
and technicians such as HVAC installers, plumbers, 
electricians, and contractors in new green materials, 
products, and solutions deployment (heat pump 
installations, modular construction, green steel, 
cement, and so on). Upskilling D&E professionals 
and certifying tradespeople could accelerate lever 
adoption, since these skilled professionals would be 
more available to install abatement levers such as 
heat pumps, modular construction, and CLT. 

Partnerships between green-job training 
academies and companies that need this talent are 
already common. Companies are eager to fill the 
talent pipeline and, in some cases, are willing to 
provide sponsorship. ARS, one of the United States’ 
largest providers of residential HVAC services, is 
sponsoring candidates to earn credentials as HVAC 
technicians via paid eight-week training camps and 

will offer jobs to those who complete the program.50 
Columbus State Community College is leading the 
development of a novel statewide strategy to fill the 
2,000 nondegreed jobs for Intel’s $20 billion facility 
(the first new fabrication plant associated with the 
CHIPS Act) with a one-year certificate program for 
upskilling existing workers.51 

8. Finance the green transition
Financing the transition would require new 
approaches. The two likely primary barriers 
to financing are high capital expenditures 
and limited insurance offerings. First, high 
capital expenditures stem from the technology 
installations or retrofits needed to decarbonize 
existing or new assets. Premiums for these green 
materials and products come from increased 
capital expenditures or operational expenditures 
to produce materials, as well as from additional 
planning and designing considerations. Second, 
insuring, underwriting, and investing in green 
projects is difficult because agencies would 
have to value assets that do not have historical 
precedents and that are not standardized or widely 
accepted across stakeholders. This can lead to 
excessive insurance prices or a lack of proper 
coverage for green projects.

Offer energy-as-a-service financing
Energy optimization solutions such as heat pumps 
often require high up-front capital expenditures, 
discouraging end users from upgrading. This 
barrier could be overcome by OEMs partnering 
with financing entities to deliver energy as a 
service in conjunction with the energy upgrade 
service (installation). Existing utilities could 
potentially provide these services in conjunction 
with financing entities.

The business model for such services can possibly 
be subscription-based: the service operator would

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentprovide the capital needed to finance the energy 
optimization upgrades up front and recoup their 
investment by collecting monthly payments from 
the customer. This structure could help alleviate 
high up-front costs for customers for upgrades to 
their heating, cooling, distributed power, cooking, 
and lighting (among other appliances). It could 
also enable customers to benefit from lower total 
cost of ownership—the expenses associated 
with purchasing, deploying, using, and retiring a 
product throughout its lifetime—inherent in many 
green technologies. 

The financing for this business model could 
provide a bankable, energy-saving asset with 
predictable, reliable, and steady cash flows. 
Pricing could even be structured so that monthly 
payments are less than end users would otherwise 
pay in utility bills, making it a cost-beneficial 
solution. Offering performance-based contracts 
based on achieving mutually agreed-upon 
performance cost goals could ensure the symbiotic 
relationship of these contracts. 

In addition to partnerships between OEMs and 
financial entities, partnerships can be made 
across the energy solution value chain. To share 
the risks and benefits, optimization planners, 
installers, OEMs (such as heat pumps and insulation 
manufacturers), green-material procurement 
companies, financiers, and administrative services 
can come together to provide turnkey commercial 
and residential energy upgrade services to 
ensure that those upstream have a market and 
that those downstream have the necessary 
materials, products, and services to execute energy 
optimization plans and navigate tax subsidies and 
incentives. For example, Apollo, an asset manager, 
and Johnson Controls, a heat pump manufacturer 
and energy optimization solutions planner, 
partnered to create a turnkey performance-based 
energy efficiency and smart buildings service for 
commercial buildings at no up-front cost.52  

Energy as a service would not be limited to 
site-specific energy upgrades. District heating, 
community solar, and microgrids could be financed 
similarly. A 100 percent renewable energy source 
would allow 100 percent abatement for all electric 
levers.53 These power solutions could be financed 
by securing purchasing power agreements (PPAs) 
from real estate investors and holders. The PPAs 
could then collateralize the loan for the power 
solution to secure favorable funding from banks or 
capital markets. 

Develop project financing for green solutions 
New technologies and processes associated with 
decarbonization will likely require a modification 
in cost structure and ROI calculations. For 
example, this might involve higher up-front 
capital expenditures for products such as heat 
pumps that have long-term cost savings. Another 
example might be increasing up-front design 
and engineering for off-site prefabrication to 
shorten project durations. These new technologies 
and processes would allow developers to 
obtain financing and investors and financial 
intermediaries to provide it. This is particularly 
relevant for financiers as financial institutions seek 
to decarbonize their portfolios for their net-zero 
targets. (More than 40 percent of global banking 
assets are committed to net-zero targets.54) 

Financial entities and developers stand to benefit 
from a number of financial levers related to 
decarbonizing the built environment. Financial 
barriers can be unlocked by financial intermediaries 
and investors by modifying time horizons (to 
account for long-term energy efficiency savings) for 
cash flows and other existing financing structures 
and products. Modifying these products and 
instruments could allow financial institutions and 
other parties to effectively compare the ROI of 
conventional and green investments, since green 
projects tend to have higher up-front costs than 
conventional projects but realize more savings 
in the long term. Furthermore, developers and

48

Building value by decarbonizing the built environmentfinanciers can benefit from financial incentives 
offered for green solutions, such as premiums from 
green bonds and better discount rates from fewer 
stranded existing assets.  

Scale offerings of green insurance underwriting 
Conventional insurers can find it difficult to assess 
the risks of green building materials and processes. 
Whereas conventional materials and technologies 
have been used for 30 or more years across many 
types of buildings and infrastructure, new green 
materials lack this proven track record. However, 
green buildings and infrastructure would still require 
insuring, so it is essential that the insurance industry 
finds ways to facilitate this transition. Insurance 
companies specializing in green buildings and 
infrastructure could be the early players to take 
potentially higher risks (at the right premium). Built-
environment expertise will aid in insuring retrofits 
because retrofits are often an uncertainty for 
underwriters. Expertise will allow insurers to answer 
questions such as whether the asset should be 
insured as a new green asset or as its original build 
and erection date. 

Insurers have the opportunity to facilitate 
insurance for projects and structures by creating 
forward-leaning real estate underwriting 
capabilities for structures made with green 
technologies. With a green premium, insurers 

can also guarantee that assets being rebuilt 
after loss will use green materials, technologies, 
and processes, regardless of the original build. 
Partnerships between D&E firms specializing in 
green solutions and insurers could also accelerate 
the adoption through information sharing of 
acceptable deployment methods for green 
solutions in the projects and structures these 
insurers are being asked to underwrite.

Deploy investments to make existing 
real estate and infrastructure green
Financing can provide investment opportunities 
to turn the existing built environment into green 
investments. By 2030, the global retrofit potential 
market is forecast to grow to hundreds of billions 
of dollars annually.55 Investors could capture 
above-market returns by transforming existing real 
estate and infrastructure assets into green assets 
through decarbonization solutions focused on 
cost-effectiveness. This excess return could  
be captured by improving efficiency (energy 
reduction and design improvement cost savings), 
as well as from green investment and rental 
premiums from documented emissions reductions, 
government incentives, carbon credits, reduced 
risk from stranded existing assets, and optimized 
carbon taxes.

Where to go  
from here

Each company in the built environment 
and adjacent industries can consider 
new green businesses it could build 
and companies with which it could 
partner to create and realize value.

Decarbonizing the built environment is a 
significant challenge with the potential for equally 
significant value creation. Despite the size of this 
task, there are clear actions that each player can 
take today to reduce the ecosystem’s carbon 
footprint and capture value from new business 
opportunities. Players hoping to benefit from these 
opportunities could do the following:

 — Assess existing business and operating models, 
and identify changes critical to succeed in the 
future industry ecosystem. 

 — Identify which opportunity areas they  

can play in and what core capabilities would  
be required to launch and scale the new 
business opportunities.

 — Channel investments and efforts toward building 
new green businesses and developing solutions 
and offerings.

The opportunities are not limited to large ecosystem 
players; most companies in the ecosystem can 
potentially find value in building businesses to 
industrialize green solutions. Newer players can 
focus on trends that could disrupt the industry. 
For instance, disruptors in their early stages of 
development have even shown the potential to 

reduce their carbon footprint in concrete by up to 
100 percent by replacing cement with industrial 
waste or biological materials and by carbon-curing 
concrete for permanent mineralization. In this 
way, small players can help prove the potential of 
promising solutions and highlight them as good 
sites for investments to scale by 2030.  

For the entire ecosystem, companies of all sizes and 
maturity can seek partners to enable the upscaling 
of new green solutions. By working together, 
companies can gain access to new markets and 
channels and share any potential risks associated 
with industrializing solutions. Smaller manufacturers 
can partner with investors and larger, more-
established players to industrialize their solutions 
and create offtake agreements to ensure steadier, 
less risky demand. This could be supported by 
downstream efforts from real estate investors, 
which could review what materials and technologies 
will be most critical to reach net-zero emissions and 
work with corresponding manufacturers, service 
providers, developers, and EPC firms to implement 
and scale these solutions. Investors and financiers 
also could identify high-potential manufacturers, 
suppliers, and disruptors and partner with forward-
leaning real estate companies to develop and 
provide competitive financing solutions.

To support industrialization, players can also 
take steps within their own businesses to secure 
the supply and demand for green solutions. For 
example, to support the deployment of low-
emissions technologies, real estate companies 
could set ambitious specifications for green 
solutions. This could create demand and ensure 
offtake for materials such as low-carbon cement, 
as well as for green technologies and services. 
Contractors and distributors could also build

aggregate demand and secure supply.

Significant efforts are still needed today to pave the 
way for decarbonizing the built environment, but 
many of the transformative technologies required 

in the long term are already viable today or, with the 
right focus and investments, could be soon. Players 
positioned to swiftly move and act upon these 
opportunities, in part by collaborating with others in 
the ecosystem, are likely to realize value and play a 
vital part in building a net-zero world.
