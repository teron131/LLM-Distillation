The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrivePreface

In December 2021, we published our inaugural report on Latino economic mobility, The economic 
state of Latinos in America: The American dream deferred. It called attention to Latinos in 
the United States, highlighting their contributions as workers, business owners, consumers, 
and savers. The findings in this follow-up report, The economic state of Latinos in the US: 
Determined to thrive, provide an updated, multidimensional view of Latino economic life, with 
particular attention on Latino consumers, who represent a fast-growing segment underserved 
by existing offerings. Our framework is similar to that of last year’s report but anchored by 
consumers, who fuel economic growth across the US. We have embedded examples of actions 
companies and nonprofits are already taking to support Latinos in the US, as thought starters 
and potential sources of inspiration.

Our goal for this report is to shed light on both the barriers and the enablers of economic mobility 
so that we continue building a stronger, more inclusive economy. Seven out of ten people across 
the world live in societies with growing inequality, and this is particularly true for Latinos, who 
have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation.1  As a firm, we 
are committed to enabling sustainable and inclusive growth. We have invested in over 23,000 
Asian, Black, and Latino leaders through our Connected Leaders Academy to date, a program 
focused on capability-building and driving transformative personal and professional change. 
Additionally, we have helped launch Ownership Works, a new nonprofit aimed to create  
$20 billion of wealth for working families.  

The research was led by Ana Paula Calvo, who is a consultant in McKinsey’s Miami office, where 
Carolina Mazuera is an associate partner; Lucy Pérez, who is a senior partner in the Boston 
office; and Bernardo Sichel, who is a partner in the Chicago office.

The project teams were led by Jordan Morris and included Anna Maria Gil, Valeria Zuniga, 
Miranda David, and José de Lapuerta. Maria Gutierrez and Margret-Ann Natsis led external 
outreach and the authors would like to thank them for their contributions and support. 

We would especially like to thank the Aspen Institute’s Latinos and Society program for their 
knowledge partnership and commitment to sharing this research externally.

We hope this report, together with our previous publication from 2021, will spur further action. 
This work is independent and reflects our own views.

Executive summary

US Latinos account for the fastest-growing portion of US GDP. So much so, that if we considered 
US Latinos as their own country, it would be third only to the GDP growth rate of China and India 
in the past decade.2 At a time of economic uncertainty with concerns about a possible recession 
growing, consumers are looking for additional support. Our research estimates that the Latino 
consumer base has unmet needs of more than $100 billion currently, and this could grow six-fold 
to $660 billion if we address the parity gap between Latinos and non-Latino Whites based on 
share of population.

Latino consumers are driving growth while their needs go unmet

Over the past decade, Latinos have grown their household consumption to reach a cumulative 
$1 trillion market in 2021—a 6 percent annual growth rate over the last decade. Their household 
spend is higher compared to other groups at similar income levels, and yet marketing spend 
directed at Latinos most likely does not reflect this.3 Latinos are conscious of their impact, 
choosing brands that value the environment and their employees, all of which makes them more 
influential than their income levels would suggest. 

However, Latino consumers are often highly dissatisfied with the products offered to them—
especially compared to their non-Latino White counterparts. This dissatisfaction ranges 
across product categories, from food and beverages to financial products, which may point to 
unresolved needs that impact their daily life. If brands address the drivers of dissatisfaction in 
terms of access and value proposition, there is a collective $109 billion of revenue at stake, when 
considering current spending and future potential should improved products be offered. 

Latino voices remain underrepresented in the C-suites of corporate America where product 
offerings and capital allocation decisions are made, and this is particularly true of Latina 
women. As a result, Latino consumers are often overlooked by companies that do not recognize 
them as a priority demographic. Less than 5 percent of seats in Fortune 500 boards and in 
C-suites of corporate America are occupied by Latinos despite this community representing 
19 percent of the US population.4  Latina women hold 1 percent of seats in Fortune 500 boards, 
the smallest percentage of board seats compared to any racial or ethnic demographic in the 
US.5  Furthermore, Latina women may be further marginalized at work as described in our latest 
Women in the workplace report.6  

At the same time, Latinos have also been more heavily impacted by COVID-19 and inflation than 
other populations, and this has exposed their vulnerabilities. Consequently, Latinos are expected 
to change their consumer spending and take aggressive action to switch to brands that better 
meet their needs. Companies that support Latino consumers by optimizing value propositions 
and tailoring their marketing and sales strategies have a singular opportunity to capture the 
potential this growing market represents.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrive23%

Closing the Latino wealth gap would strengthen the existing 
consumer opportunity by more than 500 percent 

 of Latinos are considered 
financially healthy in 2022

In a scenario in which Latinos match their spend to their share of population, Latino consumers 
would spend around $554 billion more than today. Closing this gap would require addressing 
the underlying income and savings gaps between Latinos and non-Latino Whites. Employers 
and society at large have much to gain from providing Latinos with better jobs that also provide 
advancement and leadership opportunities. 

In pursuing greater prosperity and fulfilment, Latinos increased their share of professional roles 
to 25 percent—a five percentage point gain over the past decade. However, Latinos still face 
barriers in the workplace, through discrimination, implicit biases, or a lack of opportunities for 
advancement in new roles. In fact, if Latinos were represented at job levels in line with their share 
of the population, and paid the same as non-Latino Whites, they would receive an additional 
$281 billion in annual income that could be further deployed to drive economic growth. 7 

Latino savers have only a fifth of the median wealth of their non-Latino White counterparts, 
and their savings have been depleted; today, almost half of Latinos have little or no retirement 
savings. Only 23 percent of Latinos are considered financially healthy in 2022 compared to  
35 percent of non-Latino Whites. Nevertheless, Latinos’ net wealth is increasing at a faster 
rate (9 percent for Latinos, versus 4 percent for non-Latino Whites), narrowing—but not yet 
closing—the gap with non-Latino Whites. If the trend continues, Latino households could reach 
an average net worth of $47,000 this year. 

While Latinos have about half as much debt as non-Latino White counterparts, this may be 
because they find it difficult to access appropriate financial products. Latinos are 1.7 times more 
likely than non-Latino Whites to be turned down for a loan, and 30 percent are unbanked or 
underbanked compared to 12 percent of their non-Latino White counterparts.8 For financial 
institutions, this is a significant opportunity to address an underserved consumer market.

Investing in Latino entrepreneurs is a key part of the answer

Latinos are the most entrepreneurial group in the US economy, but they face significant barriers 
in access to capital—including lower approval rates than non-Latino White-owned businesses 
for bank loans, private-equity funding, and factoring. Less than 5 percent of venture capital is 
directed toward Latino entrepreneurs.9 These obstacles, along with Latino businesses’ lower 
representation in fast-growing economic sectors, limit their expansion and their opportunity to 
contribute to a more diversified product offering that meets the needs of American consumers.

If Latino businesses’ access to capital were improved, and their representation in growing 
sectors increased, they would contribute an additional $2.3 trillion in revenue to the economy 
and create 750,000 new employer firms, resulting in more than six million jobs. 10 Interventions to 
improve access to funding, both from financial institutions and procurement-led organizations, 
and investments in digital capabilities for Latino businesses can help realize this potential.

Latinos’ proven resilience through the pandemic indicates 
strong fundamentals for economic mobility

Latinos play a crucial and growing role in the US economy and have demonstrated 
resourcefulness, hard work, and creativity—despite being challenged by lower-paying jobs, less 
education, and widespread bias. Over the past year, it has become clear that Latinos are also 
uniquely vulnerable to income disruption. When COVID-19-associated lockdowns began to be 
implemented, Latinos found themselves in a precarious position: they were more concentrated 
in low-wage occupations than non-Latino Whites.11  As a result, almost 60 percent of Latinos—
who are overrepresented in industries most impacted by COVID-19, such as hospitality—lost 
their jobs or had to take a pay cut, and they are now more vulnerable to high inflation than other 
groups.

The longer-term challenges Latinos face have been compounded recently by the triplicate 
effects of COVID-19, supply chain disruptions, and high inflation affecting Latino businesses’ 
operations. Altogether, 60 percent of Latino-owned businesses had to reduce or modify 
their operations during the pandemic—to such a degree that some could not survive without 
government assistance. Fortunately, 80 percent of Latino businesses had stabilized their sales 
back to 2019 levels by the second half of 2021.

Our latest findings point to other welcome signs of agility among economically active Latinos. 
Over the past year, they have increased their share in professional occupations, raised their net 
worth faster than their non-Latino White counterparts, and shown their mettle as the fastest-
growing minority entrepreneurial group. As consumers, Latinos already represent a $1 trillion 
market, and their spending power is rising (6 percent compounded annual growth in the last 
decade, compared to 3 percent for the non-Latino White population).12 

Latinos have been making significant strides over the past decade, and even more recently in 
the aftermath of the disruption presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, deliberate 
intervention is necessary to close the gap and fuel a stronger US economy. If companies, 
investors, nonprofits and philanthropists, and policymakers act now, they can address the 
barriers that hinder full economic participation by Latinos.

The right combination of structural and immediate interventions can accelerate Latino 
economic advancement and prosperity. Action is needed in several key areas: improving 
Latino representation and inclusion in decision-making bodies; expanding product portfolios, 
optimizing value propositions and targeting marketing and sales strategies for Latino consumers; 
increasing access to capital for Latino entrepreneurs; improving access to education, reskilling 
opportunities, and better jobs for Latino workers; and removing bias and discrimination. 

Winning the US Latino consumer, worker, saver, and entrepreneur is an outsize opportunity for 
organizations that act now and invest in the right people, processes, and systems to serve a 
market that has not been as visible as its numbers would foretell.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveSidebar 
The journey continues

McKinsey’s first report in this series, The Economic State 
of Latinos in America: The American dream deferred, was 
published in December 2021. It shone a spotlight on Latinos in 
the US—a rapidly growing population who make an outsized 
contribution as workers, entrepreneurs, consumers, and 
savers, but who remain economically well behind their non-
Latino White counterparts.

Highlights of the 2021 report: 

•  Latinos are a fast-growing population that will represent 
over 25 percent of the population by 2050 and a 
significant share of the US labor force. Latinos will make 
up nearly a quarter of the US labor force by 2030 and 
nearly a third by 2060.

1   “2019 survey of consumer finances,” Federal Reserve, 2020.

•  Latinos are concentrated in low-wage occupations, are 
less likely to have nonwage employer benefits, and are 
strikingly underrepresented in higher-paying occupations 
based on their share of the US labor force.

•  Latinos are highly entrepreneurial but constrained by lower 
access to capital, which limits their abilities to start and 
scale their businesses. 

•  While Latino consumption is growing at a faster pace than 
that of non-Latino Whites, it still lags well behind Latinos’ 
share of the US population, constrained by lower incomes 
and wealth.

•  Latino wealth has grown at a rate more than twice that of 

non-Latino White wealth, given low participation in assets 
that accumulate wealth (for example, stock market) and a 
lower base ($36,000 for Latinos versus $188,000 for non-
Latino Whites).1 

Data sources 

This research is based on both publicly available sources and proprietary McKinsey data, 
research, and tools. Data used in this report was drawn from multiple sources including the  
US Census Bureau, Stanford Graduate School of Business, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and 
McKinsey consumer surveys. The primary external sources include the US Census Bureau’s 
American Community Survey, the Fed’s Small Business survey, Stanford’s 2021 State of Latino 
Entrepreneurship, and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Expenditure Survey. We 
also designed and implemented a consumer survey (conducted August 2022, n = 4,400) to 
better understand Latino consumer preferences and dissatisfaction. 

This survey also focused on understanding differences across Latino subgroups, including by 
place of birth and income bracket, amongst other dimensions.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrive1. Introduction

Latinos are a fast-growing population in the US, and their role is becoming more critical than 
ever—especially at a time when the broader economy is strained by inflationary headwinds. As 
consumers, Latinos already represent a $1 trillion market, and their strength is increasing.13  They 
increasingly occupy higher-skilled and professional roles as both workers and business owners. 
And, as savers, they are preparing their families for the future. 

Yet, too often, Latinos find themselves stuck in low-wage jobs with limited prospects that do not 
reflect their full potential. They felt the economic impact of COVID-19 to a greater degree than 
non-Latino Whites. 14 

Similarly, Latinos have proven they are more vulnerable to the impact of high inflation. This makes 
it more urgent than ever to understand the role Latinos play in the US and to undertake far-
reaching interventions that promote equitable advancement and opportunity—as discussed in 
last year’s report, The economic state of Latinos in America: The American dream deferred.

Change is possible, and a better, fairer, and more equitable society for Latinos can be created, 
strengthening and improving US society for all. In this report, we have identified practical, 
targeted interventions, with examples of corporate actions, that can address Latinos’ needs and 
could unleash trillions of dollars into the US economy. The structural and practical interventions 
proposed could support Latinos as they consolidate their economic significance in the US—
closing the gaps in a move that will hold massive gains for society as a whole. And for millions 
of households and communities, this would mean better security, more prospects, and more 
financial freedom.

Latinos in the US

Latinos form a substantial and growing demographic, accounting for almost 19 percent of the US 
population today. On average, they are younger and increasingly more educated, as  
70 percent have completed at least a high school education.1  Over a third are immigrants and 
may be supporting family members elsewhere. They tend to be overrepresented in lower-paying 
occupations, face barriers accessing capital, and find it more difficult to save and invest in assets 
that accumulate wealth over time.

Driving growth with 
conscious choices

Over the past decade, Latinos have grown their household consumption to reach a cumulative 
$1 trillion market in 2021—a 6 percent annual growth rate over the past decade. Their household 
spend is higher compared to other groups at similar income levels given that Latino households 
are larger than those for non-Latino Whites. And Latinos are conscious of their impact, choosing 
brands that value the environment and their employees, all of which makes them more influential 
than their income levels would suggest. 

However, Latino consumers are often highly dissatisfied with the products offered to them—
especially compared to their non-Latino White counterparts. This dissatisfaction ranges 
across product categories, from food and beverages to financial products, which may point to 
unresolved needs that impact their daily life. If brands can address price and quality—the drivers 
of dissatisfaction—there is a potential $109 billion in spending at stake for Latino consumers. 

At the same time, Latinos have also been more heavily impacted by COVID-19 and inflation 
than other populations. They are likely to take aggressive action to save money and switch to 
brands that better meet their needs (Exhibit 1). Companies can support Latino consumers by 
optimizing value propositions, offering value product lines, and tailoring their marketing and sales 
strategies. 

Sidebar 
The Latino consumer is younger, increasingly more educated, and with less income

Latinos form a large and growing demographic within the US 
and account for an increasing share of total consumption, 
although there is a spending gap between them and others. 
Latinos are relatively young, with a median age of 30.5 years, 
and more than a third are immigrants, compared to under  
5 percent among non-Latinos.16  In terms of country of origin, 
Mexicans account for the largest group of immigrant Latinos, 
representing 62 percent of the total US Latino population, 
followed by Puerto Ricans (10 percent). 

Latinos have lower incomes when compared to other groups: 
37 percent of Latino households have an annual income of 
less than $40,000 compared to 28 percent of non-Latino 
households. Their education levels are increasing—in 2014, 
36 percent had not completed high school, but by 2020, 

only 30 percent lacked a high-school diploma—but still lag 
other groups, with only 9 percent of non-Latino Whites not 
completing high school.17  As a result, they earn less, are 
overrepresented in lower-paying occupations, and have fewer 
opportunities for advancement, as discussed in the previous 
chapter.

As a diverse demographic, despite certain generalities, they 
show correspondingly diverse behavior. Besides socio-
economic differences, US-born Latinos show a higher level 
of acculturation, such as language use, and their preferences 
are closer to those of their non-Latino White counterparts 
than those of foreign-born Latinos. Latino consumers can be 
understood and segmented appropriately to address their 
differing needs.

Latinos grow their spending, despite lower income levels

Latinos form a key consumer group in the US, with a market size of $1 trillion per annum—
despite a spending gap in part due to lower income levels. As a group, Latinos are growing their 
consumption faster than non-Latino Whites (Exhibit 2).

While Latinos’ overall spend has increased significantly in the past decade, it still lags their share 
of population: Latinos account for 19 percent of the US population but drive only 13 percent of 
total household income, with more expenditure on essentials such as food at home, healthcare, 
and housing. While Latinos spend more than their population share in rental accommodation, 
men’s and children’s clothing, and footwear, there is still a $554 billion gap in consumption that 
could be closed if Latinos’ expenditure matched their share of the US population (Exhibit 3).15

Despite their lower average income levels, Latino households spend more than others at the 
same income level. Sixty percent of Latinos have a household income of under $50,000, 
compared to 50 percent of non-Latino Whites. But Latinos in this demographic spend slightly 
more per household than non-Latino Whites in the same income bracket—$21,300 per annum

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrivecompared to $20,900.16  This is largely driven by higher spending on essentials, with half of 
Latino income, on average, going to food at home, housing, and healthcare. However, given that 
Latino households are larger than non-Latino White households (with an average of 3 people per 
household, compared to 2.3 for non-Latino Whites), the actual spend per consumer is slightly 
lower ($7,100 for Latinos versus $9,087 for non-Latino White counterparts).17

Latino consumer needs are not being met

Across all categories, Latinos are more dissatisfied with current offerings than their non-Latino 
White counterparts.18  Twenty-eight percent of Latinos report being unhappy with current 
product offerings, compared to 21 percent of non-Latino Whites. 19 Dissatisfaction represents a 
missed opportunity for companies—Latino consumption could be significantly increased if their 
needs were met more effectively. 

In some instances, Latinos may have a need for products in particular categories but are not 
purchasing, while in other instances, Latinos are buying products in categories even though they 
are not satisfied with the product choice, quality, or price. 

Product penetration among Latinos can be low: a quarter of Latinos do not currently purchase in 
specific spending categories (such as makeup or full-service restaurants), despite being decision 
makers and having a need for the product, thus creating another significant opportunity for 
companies. 

Consumer dissatisfaction varies extensively among Latino subgroups, driven by differences 
in education, income, background, and gender. Latinos who are less educated are unhappier 
with products. Their dissatisfaction scores are 14 percentage points higher than the average 
Latino. Those who have not completed high school are three times more dissatisfied than non-
Latino Whites at the same educational level.20  Latinos from lower-income backgrounds (less 
than $50,000 per year) have an average dissatisfaction nine percentage points higher than the 
average for Latinos, at 37 percent. And first-generation immigrants are seven percentage points 
more dissatisfied than average. Latina women are ten percentage points more dissatisfied than 
Latino men, similar to the 12 percentage point difference seen between White men and women.

Latino dissatisfaction with current product offerings grew significantly between 2021 and 2022 
across all categories, and they are consistently more dissatisfied than non-Latino Whites, even 
though non-Latino Whites are also more dissatisfied than previously. Beauty and personal care, 

A quarter of Latinos do not currently 
purchase in specific spending categories, 
despite being decision makers and 
having a need for the product, 
thus creating another significant 
opportunity for companies.

18   Dissatisfaction is measured by rating satisfaction levels between one and six on a ten-point scale.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveentertainment, hospitality and travel, vehicle purchases, housing, banking and financial services, 
and healthcare are all categories with higher-than-average Latino dissatisfaction.

Latinos are dissatisfied with current product offerings for several reasons, particularly price, lack 
of features, and lack of value for money. For both non-Latino Whites and Latinos, affordability 
and quality are the main decision drivers for purchases.

High prices are linked to dissatisfaction across categories, and, given low disposable income (as 
discussed in the previous chapter), remain a critical consideration. A shortage of quality products 
and poor value for money also lead to dissatisfaction (Exhibit 4). And, while less important than 
price, customers are disappointed with companies that are not committed to addressing social 
inequities.

Opportunities to address dissatisfaction: A win-win situation

Addressing Latino consumers’ dissatisfaction could benefit both companies and consumers. 
Latino buyers would be willing to increase their consumption by up to 25 percent if products were 
more affordable, of a higher quality, and healthier; they expressed willingness to pay 28 percent 
more if the top reasons for dissatisfaction were addressed. Altogether, they would be willing to 
spend a total of $33 billion more per year across all categories if their needs were met  
(Exhibit 5). Even Latino consumers who are currently satisfied would be willing to pay more if 
product offerings were improved, with a total of $76 billion of revenue at stake. 21 With  
$109 billion in current and potential spending at stake, companies that address dissatisfaction 
may benefit from additional market support. However, this is unlikely to be incremental, as much 
of this would be due to potential shifts in spending from one product or service to another.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrive 
Latino consumption patterns: Strategic spenders, 
socially aware, and social media savvy

There is also a $554 billion gap in Latino consumption based on the discrepancy between their 
total expenditure as a share of overall US spending and their share of population—and closing 
this gap would require improving Latino income levels. This is in addition to the $109 billion of 
spending at stake that arises from Latino consumer needs going unmet, discussed above.

Understanding how Latinos consume, and how their behavior differs from non-Latinos, will 
allow society to close this gap and realize the benefits. Latinos tend to be careful and strategic 
spenders, and, despite having a lower average income than non-Latino Whites, are discerning 
consumers with a high level of attention for sustainability considerations when making a 
purchase.22 

They are, overall, conservative and conscious spenders. Latinos spend a greater proportion 
of their income on essentials compared to their non-Latino White counterparts (40 percent 
compared to 33 percent). Survey data shows they tend to be more price-conscious than the 
general US population, feel more financial pressure, and actively look for savings and deals. 23 
Almost half of Latinos are actively looking for ways to save money, above the national average 
of 44 percent. They are also more willing to switch to less-expensive products to save costs 
(34 percent compared to 27 percent of all consumers), and more than a third of Latinos actively 
research the best promotions when seeking to make purchases (35 percent compared to  
29 percent of all consumers). 

Moreover, this price-conscious behavior supports the finding that Latinos in lower-income 
households (representing the majority) tend to spend less per person than their non-Latino 
White counterparts. As a result, Latinos, like non-Latino Whites, are increasingly looking for 
ways to save money. They pay similar attention to prices when shopping compared to non-Latino 
Whites (47 percent compared to 45 percent). Latinos may be willing to spend more on products 
they care about, while finding cheaper alternatives for those they are less invested in. But Latinos 
may also be under more pressure to save money because of their larger average household size, 
which necessitates greater spending on essentials.

Latinos are comfortable shopping online and are engaged consumers. They are more conscious 
of sustainability considerations and are more likely to factor in such considerations when making 
purchases than the general population. 24 Social issues and organic products are particularly 
important to them compared to the general population (a 12 and 14 percentage point difference 
respectively). In total, 82 percent of Latinos report that they use omnichannel (online and 
in-store) and e-commerce platforms, compared to 80 percent of the overall population.25  

Social media can be a powerful influence on consumer behavior and its effects are more 
pronounced in Latinos than in the overall US population. Latinos of all age groups are more likely 
to be influenced by social media when making a purchase, with 68 percent of them reporting that 
they are nudged toward certain brands by social media posts compared to 47 percent overall 
among US consumers.26  Correspondingly, Latinos have a higher average level of social media 
engagement than non-Latinos across all major social media platforms. For instance, 89 percent 
of Latinos use YouTube at least weekly, compared to 75 percent overall.27

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveAcross the board, the categories that see the largest influence from social media are appearance 
related, such as fitness and wellness services, skin care and makeup, and accessories and 
jewelry. However, among Latinos, influence from social media in consumer electronics and home 
decoration is felt significantly more strongly than in the overall population, with a 24 and  
19 percentage point difference, respectively, in the percentage of respondents who were 
influenced by social media in purchases in these categories.28

Latino consumers are also much more likely to be influenced by brands and celebrities’ posts on 
social media, and documentaries, compared to non-Latinos. Half of Latino consumers said they 
were inspired to purchase by these sources, compared to a quarter of non-Latinos.29  

Latino consumers are feeling the inflationary pinch 

The COVID-19 pandemic hit Latinos hard and inflation is compounding the impact. In response, 
almost 80 percent of Latinos are taking action to manage their expenses due to inflationary 
pressures, compared to two-thirds of non-Latino consumers.30 This may include reducing 
savings, increasing credit card balances, taking on more hours at work or a second job, and 
skipping bills or paying less than the minimum due. 

Latinos’ pre-existing price-conscious behavior has been exacerbated by high inflation. A fifth are 
planning to cut back on spending, compared to 14 percent of non-Latino Whites, while  
82 percent are trading down across categories, compared to 74 percent of non-Latinos.31  This 
includes adjusting the quantity or pack sizes purchased, delaying purchases, switching to a 
cheaper brand, and taking on more debt by using “buy-now, pay-later” services (a strategy that is 
more prevalent among Latinos than the general population by 11 percentage points).

Overall consumption is expected to fall across the board, with Latinos cutting back more 
than non-Latino Whites. Total consumption is predicted to drop by 7 percent among Latinos, 
compared to only 1 percent in non-Latino Whites.32  The fall in Latino spending could account 
for an aggregate loss of $80 billion, close to the expected effect of reduced consumption 
among non-Latino Whites, at $100 billion—this despite non-Latino Whites having six times the 
aggregate consumption of Latinos.

Non-essential categories will be particularly hard hit, even after sustaining a drop in spending 
due to COVID-19. Although overall spending, which dipped in 2020, has now mainly returned to 
2019 levels, essential goods account for a larger share than previously. Going forward, Latinos 
are predicted to reduce their spending at three times the rate of the general population for 
essential categories, and five times for non-essentials.33  They are likely to pull back on non-
essential spending by 10 percent but will only drop spending by 3 percent for essentials.34  

To reduce their spending, consumers across the board are responding to inflation by choosing 
private brands across categories. Overall, 48 percent of customers who noticed inflation 
changed brands, and, of this, the switch was to private brands 38 percent of the time. Latinos 
reflect this general trend, with 47 percent switching brands and 36 percent switching to  
private brands.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveMore vulnerable cohorts are likely to be badly affected by inflation (Exhibit 6). Latinos with less 
acculturation, a low household income level, and those with little formal education are expected 
to reduce their consumption by around five percentage points more than the average for Latinos. 
First-generation Latino immigrants are also expected to be hard hit, reducing their consumption 
by an extra three percentage points. And gender is a significant factor—women are likely to 
reduce their consumption by a further three percentage points.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveBudget-conscious consumers want companies 
to meet them where they’re at

By addressing dissatisfaction and tailoring products accordingly, companies can retain their 
existing customer base and potentially grow their sales. Two broad categories of interventions 
could help Latino consumers close gaps.

More Latino customers are looking for better prices and promotions. Optimizing products to 
offer more affordable lines, or bundling products together, can mitigate the loss in customers’ 
purchasing power and bring in new customers who are open to change.

More granular segmentation of Latino audiences, with tailored marketing strategies, can 
help ensure product features are aligned to consumer values. Latinos are far from monolithic, 
and companies that are aware of this diversity can provide appropriate products. Quality, health, 
and environmental and social benefits can be highlighted for greater appeal. For example, 
Pepsico aims to become the most-loved food and beverage company among Latinos—as a 
result, it has launched a Hispanic business unit as a cross-functional multidisciplinary group to 
improve its understanding of Latinos’ attitudes and behaviors and how they change over time. 

Last year’s report found that 41 million Latinos live in consumer deserts without access to vital 
products and services.35  As a result, many Latinos lack sufficient access to housing, food, 
banking, broadband, and consumer goods. While solving this issue will require commitment and 
concerted action from many players over the long term, it also points to the need for optimizing 
retail locations to enable Latinos to purchase products conveniently and easily.

Latinos are far from monolithic, and 
companies that are aware of this 
diversity can provide appropriate 
products. Quality, health, and 
environmental and social benefits can 
be highlighted for greater appeal.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveSidebar 
Beauty is in the eye of the Latino beholder:  
Advertising and marketing drive beauty and personal care

Beauty and personal care represent one of the most intimate 
categories for consumer spending, with close ties to identity, 
appearance, and dignity. But as Latinos watch their budgets, 
they are expected to cut their spending by 8 percent in this 
category. Companies that act on Latino preferences with 
targeted marketing and address reasons for dissatisfaction—
such as availability and affordability—may find it easier to 
weather the consumer pullback.

Latinos currently account for around 13 percent of total spend 
in this category, or $14 billion out of a total $103 billion annually. 
Fragrances are particularly at risk, with an expected 12 percent 
drop in consumption, while facial care is likely to fall by  
8 percent. By contrast, non-Latino White consumers are only 
expected to drop their spending in this category by 1 percent.

In keeping with their overall consumer behavior, Latinos spend 
carefully and strategically on beauty and personal care. Half 
of customers who notice inflation are switching personal-
care brands, with 17 percent of Latinos looking for less-
expensive beauty brands compared to 10 percent among the 
general population. A third of Latinos seek out private-label 
beauty products, four percentage points fewer than in other 
categories.

Latinos are conscious of their impact. Supporting the 
environment and using animal-friendly products remain 
key drivers for purchasing decisions in this category than 
elsewhere. For example, 17 percent of Latinos won’t purchase 
hair-care products if companies are not supporting action on 
the environment and climate change, compared to only  
8 percent of non-Latino Whites.

Using skin care as an example, Latino consumers are often 
interested in a category while simultaneously less likely to 
purchase or use it. Almost half say they consider advertising 
for the largest skin-care brands to be effective, compared 
to a quarter of non-Latino Whites. They are also less likely to 
consider skin-care brands to be too expensive (39 percent 
of Latinos against 46 percent of non-Latino Whites). Despite 
these positive signals, only 22 percent of Latinos buy these 
products compared to half of non-Latino Whites. Availability 
may be an issue. A third of Latinos found the largest skin-care 
brands were not easily available, but only a quarter of non-
Latino Whites said the same. 

Online and social media channels are becoming increasingly 
important, with 38 percent of cosmetics now bought online. 
More than half of Latinos are influenced by social media 
and recommendations from brands and celebrities when 
purchasing skin-care products and makeup, compared with 
less than half of non-Latinos. 

Despite a willingness to engage and purchase, Latino 
dissatisfaction is similar to that of non-Latino Whites, at  
28 percent compared to 21 percent, but for different reasons. 
Latinos are especially worried about quality, price, and lack 
of value compared to non-Latino Whites (Exhibit 1). If these 
factors, together with availability, were improved, Latinos would 
be willing to spend up to 18 percent more—representing a total 
of $400 million in additional revenue.1 Even those customers 
who are already satisfied would be willing to pay an additional 
$1.9 billion if product offerings were further improved in this 
category. 

More than half of Latinos are 
influenced by social media and 
recommendations from brands and 
celebrities when purchasing skin-
care products and makeup, compared 
with less than half of non-Latinos.

Companies could also consider wooing potential new 
customers who are disappointed by current product offerings. 
One out of four Latino consumers don’t purchase in this 
category even though they may be interested in doing so, and 
report that they would be willing to spend a similar amount to 
current consumers—representing a potential opportunity of 
$3.8 billion. These consumers say the beauty and personal-
care category lacks value for money, with high prices and 
low quality, and companies do not support action on the 
environment or consider climate change (Exhibit 2).

Opportunities for action

Companies could benefit from investing in advertising that 
talks directly to Latinos, while also increasing availability and 
distribution, so that brands are more available on preferred 
channels.

Some sub-categories, such as skin care, are less impacted 
by price perceptions than others, like hair care. Offering value 
product lines could be more effective in those categories 
directly affected by such perceptions.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrive3. Poised for success: 
Latinos at work, 
in business, and in 
wealth creation

Latinos play a significant role in the US economy as workers, business owners, consumers, and 
savers or investors. However, they face many barriers to advancing, whether on an individual or 
business front, and would benefit from interventions to overcome these obstacles. The private 
sector can also play an important role as Latinos seek to reach their full potential.

Latino workers: A key pillar in the US workforce

One in every five workers in the US is Latino, and the number is growing rapidly. They earn  
12 percent of wages and represent 18 percent of the workforce, making Latino workers a key 
pillar in the US economy. Although the COVID-19 pandemic impacted them disproportionately 
and Latinos are feeling the effects of elevated US inflation acutely, Latinos’ workforce share 
could increase to 23 percent in 2030.36

The Latino workforce has progressed over the past decade, increasing its share in higher-paying 
occupations by five percentage points. Yet Latinos still face steep barriers to mobility, including 
wage disparity, implicit biases, discrimination, and lack of additional training opportunities—all 
of which hinder Latinos from reaching their full potential. And, compared to non-Latino Whites, 
Latinos are primarily concentrated in low-wage occupations and are paid less than non-Latino 
White workers within the same occupations.

Overcoming these barriers could boost their annual income by more than $281 billion, enhancing 
their well-being and the health of the overall US economy.37

Most are born in the USA—and are of prime working age
The majority of the Latino workforce was born in the US and over 60 percent are of Mexican 
origin. Altogether, 43% of all Latinos are younger than 25. And 69% of those in the labor force 
are between the prime working ages of 25 and 54, compared to 64 percent of overall.38

29

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveAs highlighted in our 2021 report, The economic state of Latinos in America: The American 
dream deferred, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of Latinas in the labor 
force decreased as they lost their jobs at higher rates, sometimes to take up caregiving 
responsibilities. Today, two out of every three Latino workers are male. 

Despite striving for upward mobility, Latinos are primarily overrepresented in frontline jobs and 
earn lower wages than their non-Latino White counterparts. They fill 16 percent of frontline-
hourly and 9 percent of frontline-salaried roles in the US, compared to only 4 percent of 
executive and 3 percent of board positions (Exhibit 7).

The labor pool runs deep 
Latinos have a higher proportion of immigrants than the rest of the US population. Foreign-
born Latinos comprise 38 percent of the overall Latino population, three times higher 
than the 14 percent share of immigrants in the general US population. Among Latino 
workers, almost half (45 percent) are immigrants. The Latino labor-force participation 
in September 2022—at 67 percent—remains the highest amongst all ethnicities in 
the US. In the last decade, their participation has remained above average. 
The share of Latinos in management, professional, and related occupations has increased five 
percentage points in the last decade, reaching 25 percent. However, representation in sales and 
office roles decreased by 3 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic. And despite moving into

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveCOVID-19 dramatically affected the cost of living 
Latinos experienced economic turbulence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost 60 percent 
said someone in their household was laid off or took a pay cut. Altogether, 44 percent of all Latino 
adults said their household lost some or all income during the pandemic (Exhibit 8).

Companies changed practices that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) during the 
pandemic slowdown, affecting Latino recruitment. These changes led to decreases in internship 
programs, in the number of companies partnering with organizations to recruit Latino talent, and 
in companies leveraging employee resource groups (ERGs).

Latinos also experienced less flexibility in choosing where to work during and after the pandemic 
compared to the US average. By February 2022, US workers averaged 3.1 days working from 
their job site, while Latinos averaged 3.4 days. 

However, this varied by income level, with higher-paid workers having more flexibility, and low-
wage workers having less. Altogether, 69 percent of high-income Latinos could work from home 
by February 2022, compared to 66 percent of their non-Latino counterparts. Only 48 percent 
of lower-income Latinos could work from home, making it harder for them to juggle caring 
responsibilities while working. They also had to deal with increased transportation costs.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveCorporate ladder’s broken rungs
Latinos experienced economic turbulence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Latinos remain 
underrepresented in leadership and senior roles, but over-represented in entry-level and 
frontline positions. Around half of Latino professionals believe companies are not taking action 
on diversity, and over 40 percent complain of discrimination.

In total, 44 percent of Latino professionals have faced blatant discrimination and/or 
microaggressions at work. Similarly, 54 percent of these professionals believe there is a lot of 
talk in the workplace about diversity but no policy change to make it a reality.40 For those Latinos 
who have moved into professional roles, further challenges—such as discrimination and lack of 
support for advancement—hinder their upward mobility.

And many feel that they have been overlooked for career advancement because of their race. In 
total, 60 percent of Latino professionals between the ages of 18 and 34 years believe that race 
plays a role, while 54 percent are considering resigning due to a lack of growth or promotion 
opportunities. While 85 percent of frontline workers wanted to further their careers, only  
55 percent actually received career opportunities—a 30 percentage point difference.41 Latinos 
across all levels in the workplace are also less likely to have sponsors or mentors.

Latina women are further disadvantaged by their gender, as McKinsey’s Women in the workplace 
report makes clear. For every 100 men promoted from entry-level to manager positions, only 
75 Latina women are similarly promoted. Latinas and Black women are less likely than women 
of other races and ethnicities to say their manager shows interest in their career development. 
They also tend to feel less psychological safety—for example, less than half of Latinas and Black 
women say people on their team aren’t penalized for mistakes. Just 27 percent of Latinas say a 
senior coworker has advocated for a raise for them.42 

In addition, Latinos tend to lose representation in job levels that require greater soft skills, such 
as sales, negotiation, and management. Narrow and inconsistent definitions of interpersonal 
skills, as well as possible cultural and language differences and workplace biases, could be 
hindering their progress. Research has found that many employers consider Latinos to be 
lacking in interpersonal skills compared to their peers.43  

Despite increased calls for board diversity and a strong case for the business value of diversity, 
less than 5 percent of board seats in Fortune 500 companies and C-suite positions are occupied 
by Latinos.44  In order for their leadership representation to match their share of population, this 
number should be four times higher.

Targeted interventions could close the gap and ease hardships
Altogether, 54 percent of the wage gap exists in only 4 percent of occupations, compared to 
60 percent of the wage gap in 2020, including both the gap in representation as well as pay 
disparity within occupations between Latino and non-Latino White workers. These range from 
sales managers, first-line supervisors, engineers, information technology managers to financial 
managers, accountants, physicians, and software developers—all predominately professional 
roles that require a degree.45  This representation gap decreased by 23 percent compared to

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrive2019 but the wage gap between Latino and non-Latino workers in similar occupations increased 
by 7 percent during the pandemic. More Latino workers were hired into these roles, but there was 
also greater wage disparity between Latino and non-Latino workers.46 

The gap needs to be closed: by breaching the gap in Latino representation and wages due to 
occupational mix and wage disparity, $281 billion per year in additional income could be enabled, 
boosting Latino workers’ annual aggregate income by 34 percent.47 Latinos who reskill and 
receive support in applying for better-paying jobs may be able to advance more rapidly, invest for 
the future, and increase their resilience to absorb future economic shocks. 

Latino workers take control of their careers
Although Latino workers face barriers that non-Latino Whites do not, they can take actions to 
advance despite these obstacles. Latino workers often have a narrower professional network, 
and rely more heavily on close friends and family. By seeking out mentors and sponsors within 
their industry and across industries, they can benefit from guidance and coaching. Such mentors 
could include people who have enjoyed career success, and ideally they would make mentees 
aware of scholarships and other opportunities that can reduce the financial burden for advanced 
degrees such as law and medicine. By joining employee resource groups and professional 
associations, Latinos can also benefit from career development and skills training programs. 
Companies can also play a role, by offering mentorship and reskilling programs, and by ensuring 
employee resource groups include professional development in their initiatives. Finally, Latinos 
can commit to mentoring and sponsoring the next generation, passing on their advice and 
helping others succeed. 

Latinos are looking for opportunities to make their mark
Latinos are eager to advance in their careers and are looking for opportunities to make their 
mark. Organizations and firms with a long-term vision and commitment to growth, backed by 
proactive, deliberate, and sustainable actions, are helping them close these gaps. We have 
outlined four broad opportunities where companies are already taking action.

Corporations and Latino-focused institutions are partnering to support Latino talent 
attraction. For example, the Association of Latino Professionals for America (ALPFA) partners 
with corporations and hosts an annual career convention. This organization, established in 1972, 
was the first national professional body for Latinos and offers educational support programs, 
workforce development, and leadership skills development and opportunities.48  According to its 
website, the ALPFA has more than 100,000 professional and student members across the US, 
who have access to more than 50,000 paid summer internships via hundreds of Fortune 1000 
corporate partners.  

Latinos are looking to re-skill to advance in their careers. Organizations are offering renewed 
educational programs with a strong focus on digital and analytics. The Latino Center of the 
Midlands’ educational initiatives, such as English-language learning, Spanish literacy, technology 
basics, and US citizenship preparation, is one such organization that supports Latino workers to 
land better-paying jobs.49

Institutions are also partnering with universities and Hispanic-serving institutions to build 
a Latino talent pipeline. Google has partnered with the Hispanic Association of Colleges 
and Universities (HACU) career readiness initiative. The $2 million investment aims to help 
Hispanic-serving institutions train 200,000 Latino students in digital skills by 2025 by offering 

46   McKinsey calculations using ACS data survey. This finding may be affected by calculations, which looked at only US-born 

Latinos and did not consider immigrants.

And Coca-Cola has long partnered with the Hispanic Scholarship Fund to create scholarships, 
support educational advancement, and promote higher education.52 

Vulnerable workers can benefit from partnerships and initiatives to minimize the impact 
of economic downturns. United Way of King County in partnership with the Homeless 
Employment program at Casa Latina is a non-profit organization advancing the power and 
well-being of Latino immigrants through employment, education, and community organizing. 
Jobseekers are put in touch with employers through temporary work, and are often able to 
graduate to full-time, permanent employment.53 

Latino business owners: Flexing their entrepreneurial muscle

Latinos are one of the fastest-growing entrepreneurial groups in the US, despite owning a 
smaller percentage of US businesses. They are also resilient, demonstrating the ability to recover 
from disruptions like COVID-19. Latino entrepreneurs have deep family roots, with a quarter 
saying they started a business to provide a legacy for their families. However, they experience 
lower levels of sales and profitability than their non-Latino White counterparts, and receive less 
funding.

Access to capital and better representation in growing sectors remain some of their main 
challenges—72 percent of business owners rely on personal savings, family, and friends for 
funding.53 A change in the status quo would be greatly beneficial: if Latino businesses could 
access capital and expand into lucrative sectors, $2.3 trillion in revenues and more than 6.3 
million jobs could be added to the economy.54 

The Latino business owner: an entrepreneur at heart
Over the past two decades, Latinos have become the most entrepreneurial group in the US, with 
the number of new Latino entrepreneurs increasing by of 3.1 percent every year since 2001—1.6 
times the rate of new entrepreneurs compared to non-Latino Whites. This is equivalent to an  
86 percent increase in the rate of new entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2021.55

Yet this entrepreneurial spark is not necessarily reflected in business ownership statistics. While 
Latinos make up 19 percent of the population, they own only 6 percent of the approximately  
5.8 million employer firms in the US, and 15 percent of the 26 million non-employer firms or sole 
proprietors. An accurate demographic representation would see Latinos owning at least three 
times the number of current firms and creating about 750,000 new employer firms.56 

Latino businesses are predominately in lower-growth industries 
Since 2007 there has been a reasonably stable share of Latino-owned firms across sectors, 
with growing representation in the construction, accommodation, food services, professional, 
scientific and technical services, administration, support and waste management, and 
finance and insurance industries.57  New Latino-owned firms, however, are overrepresented

finance, and insurance.58

In addition to the disparity in revenue, Latino employer firms are on average less profitable than 
their non-Latino White counterpart firms, experiencing lower profitability of six percentage 
points over the past two years. However, this gap is closing and is down from nine percentage 
points in 2020. Similarly, the gap between Latino and non-Latino White firms that sustained 
losses also shrank from 8 percent in 2020 to 5 percent in 2021.59 

Limited access to capital for business growth
Latino businesses face obstacles to growth, with lower approval rates for formal funding, leading 
42 percent of Latino business owners to rely on personal savings, family, and friends  
(Exhibit 9). Latinos also use more credit cards, bank loans, and grants than non-Latino White-
owned businesses.60

2020 to 2021. The total invested venture capital in Latino-owner businesses is 2.4 times what it 
was in 2020.61

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveWhen Latinos do look for funding, they primarily do so to expand their businesses, pursue new 
opportunities, or acquire capital assets. This occurs more often than their non-Latino White 
counterparts (57 percent of Latinos compared to 38 percent of non-Latino Whites).62  

Generally, 46 percent of Latino entrepreneurs decline to apply for further funding (compared 
to 34 percent of non-Latino Whites), potentially driven by Latino business owners being more 
averse to debt and discouraged by prior negative experiences.65  This has resulted in lower levels 
of debt, with 71 percent of Latino-owned firms shouldering less than $100,000 debt.64 

Nonetheless, Latinos are approved for funding less often than non-Latino Whites. They are 
particularly penalized in most traditional funding types. Their approval rates are 25 percentage 
points below those of non-Latino Whites in factoring, 15 percentage points in local banks, and 
nine percentage points in private equity.65  

Weathering the COVID-19 storm: Resilience during the pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted businesses across the world, and Latino-owned firms were 
no exception. More than 60 percent of Latino-owned businesses had to reduce or modify their 
business operations during the pandemic. Of these, 60 percent saw total sales drop by more 
than a quarter for 2020. Moreover, 30 percent of them were unlikely to survive without additional 
government assistance. Other minority-owned businesses had a similar experience, with  
65 percent of Black-owned and 69 percent of Asian-owned businesses losing sales at the same 
rate, and 35 percent of Asian businesses requiring additional government support.

Despite the hardships, Latino businesses have shown signs of resilience, with 42 percent 
expected to have returned to sales levels of 2019 in the second half of 2021, and another  
22 percent expecting to do so during 2022 or later (Exhibit 10).66 

Closing the gaps: An opportunity to add trillions of dollars 
in revenue and create millions of jobs
Latino employer firms are fewer in number and smaller in size than those of non-Latino Whites, 
resulting in a $2.3 trillion revenue gap and the opportunity to generate 6.3 million jobs.67 They 
earn $450 billion, about half the revenue of non-Latino White firms. Based on Latinos’ share 
of the population (19 percent), there should be three times as many Latino business owners. 
Instead, Latino-owned businesses make up only 6 percent of the total. Currently, Latino 
employer firms generate on average only $1.6 million in revenue per firm.

Their relative underperformance results from a greater concentration in lower-growth industries 
and less revenue generation, with less profitability than non-Latino White-owned peers. 
Just four industries—wholesale and retail trades, manufacturing, and construction—account 
for almost two-thirds ($1.2 trillion) of the revenue gap between Latino and non-Latino White 
businesses, or $794 billion per firm. If this gap were closed, there would be an extra 750,000 
businesses, and overall, Latino firms would be stronger, more resilient, and would create millions 
more jobs.68

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveTaking Latino businesses to the next level 
Latino entrepreneurs can unlock even more potential with targeted structural interventions that 
are accessible and appropriate, such as the three listed below. 

PepsiCo is accelerating Latino business growth through a $50 million program. Juntos 
Crecemos aims to boost Latino-owned businesses over the next five years through donations, 
tailored curricula, and support. PepsiCo also launched the Impacto Hispanic Business 
Accelerator, which provides $10 million in funding to help 500 Latino small-food and beverage 
business owners recover from COVID-19.69 

Telecommunications giant T-Mobile partnered with non-profit advocacy group UnidosUS to 
launch a digital literacy and job readiness toolkit to address the increase in online shopping. The 
kit helps Latino entrepreneurs harness the power of digital technologies to run their small 
businesses more effectively.70

Further focusing on technology, Google and the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 
are highlighting Latino entrepreneurial excellence. The two organizations joined forces to 
create a Latino-owned attribute available across Google Search, Maps, and Shopping, as well as 
financial support and skills training for business owners. Latino-owned businesses on Google 
are now identifiable as such, which encourages people to support them.71

Retailers have recognized the value of this tailored approach—Target celebrated Latino heritage 
month with the launch of its Más Que collection, which featured more than 90 products, mostly 
created by Latino companies and designers, that pay homage to the rich heritage and diversity 
of Latino culture.72  Coca-Cola has also supported Latino heritage, this year announcing a 
$150,000 donation to the Hispanic Heritage Fund in partnership with iHeartMedia to create 
year-round programs promoting Latino culture and accomplishments.73  The company has also 
donated $2 million in support of The Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Latino and 
Molina Family Latino Gallery in Washington, DC. This is The Smithsonian’s first gallery dedicated 
to Latino contributions to the US, and will preview the National Museum of the American Latino, 
which will explore Latino achievements in art, history, culture and science.74

Latino entrepreneurs can unlock even 
more potential with targeted structural 
interventions that are accessible and 
appropriate, such as the three listed below.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveLatino savers: Slowly shifting from surviving to thriving

While Latinos’ share of the population and workforce continues to grow, their financial safety is 
not keeping pace—current high inflation, coupled with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has 
exposed their vulnerabilities. Latino savers have only a fifth of the median wealth of their non-
Latino White counterparts, their savings have been depleted, and their purchasing power has 
dropped. Their participation in assets that accumulate wealth is also lagging, particularly in real 
estate and retirement savings. In fact, almost half of Latinos have no retirement savings.75 It is no 
surprise that only 23 percent of Latinos are considered financially healthy in 2022 compared to 
35 percent of non-Latino Whites.76

Nevertheless, signs are encouraging as Latinos’ net wealth is increasing at a faster rate, from 
14 percent (2013-2016) to 21 percent (2016-2019), narrowing—but not yet closing—the gap 
with non-Latino Whites.77  If the trend continues, Latino households could reach an average net 
worth of $47,000 this year. However, tight budgets and greater exposure to inflation, with first-
generation savers particularly vulnerable, present serious challenges. 

While Latinos have about half as much debt as non-Latino White counterparts, this may be 
because they find it difficult to access appropriate financial products.78 Latinos are 1.7 times 
more likely than non-Latino Whites to be turned down for a loan, and 30 percent are unbanked or 
underbanked compared to their non-Latino White counterparts.79  

Steady household wealth off a low base
Latino household wealth represents only 3 percent of total US household wealth, at $3.9 trillion 
out of $134 trillion. This lower share is driven by lower participation in assets that accumulate 
wealth over time, particularly real estate and the stock market. However, it has seen high growth 
over the past decade.80

COVID-19 and recent inflationary pressures have hit Latino families hard, but first-generation 
ones have been more affected than those of US-born Latinos. Altogether, immigrants suffered a 
significant decrease in wealth since last year, potentially due to job loss or higher pay cuts, which 
decreased their assets and increased debt. In contrast, the assets of third-generation Latinos 
increased by 21 percent in 2021.81

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveLatinos’ relatively low asset value, lower incomes, and tighter budgets may indicate greater 
financial strain, which leads them to prioritize immediate needs over savings (Exhibit 11). In 
fact, 47 percent of Latinos consider helping friends and family more important than saving for 
retirement (compared to 35 percent of non-Latino Whites). Overall, 47 percent of Latinos have 
no savings compared to 38 percent of non-Latino Whites—translating into an approximate 
$77 billion gap in aggregated disposable savings between Latinos and non-Latino White 
households.82

COVID-19 and inflation have eaten into savings
The future looks uncertain: a quarter of Latinos depleted their savings during the COVID-19 
pandemic, leaving 27 percent of households with nothing to fall back on. The disproportional 
impact of inflation added to the inability to save, and strongly affected prices in categories that 
make up the most significant share of expenses, such as transport, housing, and food.83  

Higher inflation has also resulted in Latinos decreasing their contribution to assets and liabilities. 
Having used up their savings during the pandemic—perhaps to keep businesses afloat—Latinos 
are expected to contribute 3 percent less to assets in the coming years than they used to; unlike 
non-Latino White counterparts who do not expect to reduce their contributions. The most 
significant trade-down will be an 8 percent reduction in Latinos’ investments in cryptocurrency 
and 6 percent in checking and savings accounts. Furthermore, Latinos plan to reduce their debt 
payments by 4 percent and personal loans by 9 percent—reducing day-to-day expenditure but 
keeping them in debt for longer.84  And with 60 percent of Latinos having no retirement accounts 
because of a shortage of savings, they face an unsure future.85 

Higher inflation has also resulted in 
Latinos decreasing their contribution 
to assets and liabilities.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveFewer places to put their money 
Limited access to financial products further hinders Latinos’ financial health. They face 
a significant gap in asset diversity and total value compared to their non-Latino White 
counterparts, exacerbated by their lower income levels (Exhibit 11) and lower rates of home 
ownership.86  

Latino adults remain underserved by financial products—they are three times more likely not to 
have bank accounts, and they are 2.3 times more likely to be underbanked than their non-Latino 
White counterparts, relying on alternative financial services such as payday loans, money orders, 
and pawn shops.87 Affordability, lack of service, and poorly targeted advertising are all reasons 
why Latinos might not have bank accounts.88 In addition, those who do have bank accounts are 
slightly less satisfied with their products compared to non-Latino Whites, facing greater difficulty 
accessing the features they need and finding branches with convenient opening hours. 

Financial institutions can do more to educate potential investors and savers. The proportion 
of Latino investors in stocks and bonds is increasing, but remains small. While a third said they 
couldn’t afford to invest in bonds, stocks, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds, more than 
half of Latinos said they didn’t know what these products were, didn’t know how to invest in them, 
or had not considered these investments. Currently, just over a third of Latinos hold investment 
products, from 20 percent in 2021. These figures suggest that financial services companies 
could benefit from tailoring their products to Latinos.

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveHowever, Latino investors show a higher preference for cryptocurrency than the general US 
population, possibly due to the high adoption of cryptocurrency in Latin American countries or a 
lack of trust in traditional financial systems.89  One in four cryptocurrency owners is Latino, and  
21 percent reported that they have invested in, traded in, or used this currency. 

Less debt, fewer credit options, and higher costs 
As shown in Exhibit 12, Latinos have half as much debt as non-Latino Whites do but, as is the 
case with Latino business owners, are almost twice as likely to be turned down for credit. They 
have fewer mortgages and student, or similar, personal loans, but more credit cards. Latinos 
generally have fewer outstanding personal loans by income bracket than non-Latino Whites, 
either because they had not considered applying, or because interest rates were too high.90  
Their median debt amount is $40,000 and is primarily concentrated in mortgages.

Latinos are less likely to own a home.91  Their median household income ($55,000) is 20 percent 
lower than the minimum salary ($68,008) needed to afford median-priced homes.92  As a result, 
they have high costs for housing, but less opportunity to build their wealth, and experience twice 
as many mortgage denials as non-Latino Whites.93

loans.94 

Healthier debt profiles may count against Latinos, as a lower penetration of financial products 
lowers their credit rating. In total, 16 percent of Latinos are credit invisible as they have no credit 
history or accounts to calculate a credit score.95  They could be further disadvantaged by a lack 
of financial literacy, debt-to-income ratio, and lack of collateral. As a result, they have significant 
personal finance needs that are going unmet, and financial institutions with tailored products 
may be able to better meet the needs of Latinos. Latinos have the lowest educational attainment 
of all major racial/ethnic groups in the US population, and therefore have less student debt—      
14 percent of Latino families have educational installment loans versus 20 percent of non-Latino 
White families. Those who do take out loans apply for lower amounts ($18,000 compared to      
the $27,000 median student loan). In a survey of students who did not complete college, almost 
half of Latinos dropped out to avoid more debt (compared to about 40 percent of non-Latino 
Whites).96

Altogether, 20 percent of Latinos expressed their dissatisfaction with current financial or savings 
product offerings. Some of the main reasons they gave for this include: prices being too high 
(26 percent); not having enough money to invest (23 percent); and feeling that companies are 
not committed to addressing social inequities (13 percent). Despite being severely impacted by 
the economic downturn, Latinos indicate that they would pay approximately 16 percent more on 
average for better offerings. Satisfying their needs could increase their $208 billion balance by 
about $21 billion.97 

Promoting resilience with financially inclusive interventions: What organizations are doing 
Latinos are looking for financially inclusive solutions that allow them to invest effectively and 
ensure a stable future. Three interventions can support them to meet this need.

Credit unions focusing on the financial needs of Latinos and immigrants, such as Juntos 
Avanzamos, present in 26 states, provide a valuable service. Juntos Avanzamos based its 
financial products and services on their Latino customers’ needs. Customers learn to navigate 
the US financial system and have the tools they need to reach their savings goals, such as 
financial literacy and taxpayer identification tools.98 

Predatory lending education and financial planning resources can support Latinos 
to smooth out income volatility. For example, Latinos using the bilingual digital platform 
FinHabits can access wealth-building tools, savings, and investments, and are offered long-
term financial planning. The online investing service is designed for first-time savers, focusing on 
simplicity and access.99 

Retirement benefits could be provided to more workers. The Latinos for a Secure Retirement 
coalition aims to empower Latino communities to become economically secure. They provide the 
tools, resources, and advocacy to improve retirement security for current retirees and ensure 
retirement security for both this and future generations.100

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrive44

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrive4. Actions to support 
Latino economic 
mobility

Latinos play a crucial role in the US economy and currently account for a $1 trillion market, 
despite being challenged by lower-paying jobs, less education, and the bias they face from 
neighbors, co-workers, and employers. Over the past year, it has become clear that Latinos, for 
various reasons, are also uniquely vulnerable to income disruption and predatory lending and 
are likely to curtail their spending more sharply than other groups. By acting now, Latinos can be 
supported through instability while building their resilience to deal with future shocks. They have 
already demonstrated resourcefulness, hard work, and creativity; now, by acting in their favor, 
companies can remove barriers to full economic participation.

Two types of actions are needed. Committing to structural interventions that allow Latinos to 
compete on a more even field would build a fairer and more prosperous economy to help them 
close the gap in income and consumption levels. But at the same time, immediate, tactical 
interventions are needed now to protect Latinos as they manage tighter budgets and resources.

Our previous report, published last year, remains relevant as it highlighted a large and growing 
minority who in many ways embody the American dream of equal opportunity, rewards for hard 
work, and rising prosperity over generations, but for whom that dream was deferred. Since 
then, for many Latinos, the situation has worsened as the impact of inflation further strains 
resources and budgets. Issues such as wage disparity, lower representation in higher-paid 
positions, access to capital for business owners, and a lack of willingness to invest in these 
businesses continue to headline in the 2022 report. As a result, the structural recommendations 
we proposed in 2021, such as better compensation and reskilling for workers, increasing access 
to capital, and financial inclusion to boost Latinos’ wealth-building, are more urgent than ever. 
These should be coupled with short-term interventions that respond to the current economic 
instability.

By acting now, Latinos can be supported 
through instability while building their 
resilience to deal with future shocks.

45

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveBox
The cumulative cost of hardship

Over the course of the report, we have identified sizeable gaps in opportunity, revenue, and 
spending between Latinos and non-Latino Whites, which together impact the wealth of Latino 
savers. Less money in means less money out.

Latino workers receive $281 billion less than non-Latino Whites, as they are more likely to work 
in lower-paid jobs and be paid less than non-Latino White peers.1 Latino businesses make half 
as much revenue as non-Latino White businesses—again, as they are concentrated in lower-
performing industries, with less access to capital, and are smaller in size. Additionally, there are 
fewer Latino-owned businesses than would be expected based on their share of population, 
which deepens the divide and results in a revenue gap of $2.3 trillion.2

This lower income relative to population, among other reasons, results in a consumption gap 
of $554 billion between Latino households and non-Latino White counterparts. However, 
despite this lower overall consumption, Latinos are a formidable force in the marketplace. Latino 
households spend more than their non-Latino White counterparts at the same income level, yet 
their needs are not being met by brands to the same extent as non-Latino White households.

Mind the gaps: Six ways to boost Latino prospects

Across the four lenses of Latinos—workers, savers, business owners, and consumers—the 
right combination of structural and immediate interventions could help Latinos on the path to 
economic advancement and prosperity; actions that will hugely benefit the country.

These interventions were explored in our 2021 report and included improving access to 
education, creating targeted products and service offerings, increasing access to capital, and 
reducing and mitigating biases.101 By building on these interventions, and by addressing the 
need for improved representation across society, it is possible to find ways to kickstart Latinos’ 
journey to prosperity.

Representation: unlocking decision-making power

Latinos remain underrepresented in the boardrooms and C-suites of the most powerful 
companies in the US, making it more likely that decisions around product development, 
marketing, and supply chains overlook the needs of this key population.

•  Companies who are serious about more representative leadership can set targets for 

inclusion with strategic interventions to develop a pipeline of Latino talent.

•  Gender inclusion programs designed with intersectionality in mind will help ensure Latina 

and Black women are not left behind in the efforts to advance female leadership.

•  Building more representative leadership also requires more inclusive workplaces; to that 
end, the interventions aimed at promoting Latino workers are also needed to achieve this 
goal.

dream deferred,” McKinsey, December 9, 2021.

46

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thrive Education and re-skilling: the key to workers’ progress

Latinos are already at a disadvantage with lower education levels than other groups. They can 
raise their incomes and flatten structural hurdles with greater access to education. Workers can 
seek out opportunities to learn new skills and access mentorship and apprenticeship to support 
their career development. Structural interventions could include:

•   Supporting Latinos to re-skill into higher-paid occupations.

•  Providing resources to build strong Latino affinity or networking groups that create 

mentorship and sponsorship for Latino workers.

•  Other actions include increasing Latino access to higher education and digital 

technologies, identifying and solving potential skills gaps, and focusing on recruiting more 
Latino talent.

•   Committing to more diverse representation in leadership and at work, including greater 
Latino representation, allows for richer experiences and more inclusive decision-making 
within companies, which ultimately impacts the range of goods and services offered to 
consumers.

Rapid remedies, mainly focusing on the impact of COVID-19 and inflation, could include:

•  Augmenting structural interventions with shorter-term and affordable reskilling and 

education programs to help Latinos embrace new careers in digitalization, food, goods 
delivery, or logistics, including resources for the changing professional needs due to 
inflation and COVID-19. Stakeholders could also explore how to invest in giving Latinos 
access to digital technologies.

•   Partnering with universities and Latino-serving institutions to strengthen a pipeline for 

Latino talent.

•  Designing programs that minimize vulnerabilities, such as free capability-building 

programs, to reskill workers in professions affected by COVID-19

Building a future: Providing relevant financial products and services

Latinos have tighter household budgets, struggle to save for retirement and improve their 
asset base and have had to dip into savings to a greater extent than their peers. Designing and 
delivering products that meet their needs for value, flexibility, and cost will support their financial 
health. Structural interventions to improve products and services could include:

•  Offering flexible investment and saving products that will address Latinos’ immediate 
needs as well as their future prosperity. Retirement and other financial benefits could be 
added to work plans to entice savers.

Potential rapid remedies to protect against income volatility could include:

•   Saving strategies and programs aimed at Latino students would support them to make 

prudent financial decisions as they enter the workforce. 

•  Providing financial education on credit scores, retirement opportunities, investment, 

and budgeting to ignite savings and investment. Latinos could protect themselves against 
predatory lending and high interest rates with such programs.

•   Reworking financial institutions’ footprints to ensure consumers retain access even 

in banking deserts.102

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveValue and quality: The new gold standard for Latino consumers

Laino consumers are unhappy with the products offered to them, with affordability, value, 
and quality being the main drivers of this dissatisfaction. By addressing the reasons for 
dissatisfaction, companies can support their needs and potentially increase their own market 
share as consumers are more likely to switch brands during this time. Companies that look to add 
or retain new potential customers changing their behavior could consider a price-first or value-
driven marketing strategy, including the following:

•   Optimizing value propositions, including private-label goods, that would help retain 

customers severely hit by the economic downturn.

•   Investing in a better understanding of Latino customers and their preferences. 

Companies that invest in understanding the Latino consumer can develop segmented 
product marketing strategies and ensure that their products are appealing, with high-
quality, health, and sustainability differentiators. In many cases, this could mean modifying 
existing products to appeal to Latinos. Using channels Latinos prefer and designing 
policies to shield the consumer from rising prices, especially on basic or essential products, 
could also help meet their needs.

•  Investing in tailored offerings such as food with flavors from Latin American countries 

and makeup with a range of tones that match the diversity of Latino population, 
among others, to meet the shifting needs and preferences of Latino consumers.

Organizations can also support the most vulnerable consumers by catering to previously 
underserved populations in the channels they prefer, and by shielding consumers from 
price increases on basic products.

Money matters: Increasing access to capital and opening business opportunities

While Latino-owned businesses have shown relative resilience, many could do with additional 
support. Key opportunities in this area point to improved access to capital, business expansion, 
and support through uncertainty. Latino business owners themselves can also seek out 
opportunities for mentorship and skills training.

Our 2021 report looked at ways to boost access to capital for Latino business owners by:

•   Setting aside funding and ensuring equal access to funds, while connecting Latino-

owned businesses with sources of capital.

•   Providing bias training and standardized methodologies to funders to minimize 

differences in approval rates.

However, Latino-owned businesses remain underrepresented in the most attractive sectors. 
Opportunities exist here to:

•   Create formal mentorship, sponsorship, and allyship programs, network 

entrepreneurs with industry experts and professionals, and support businesses in setting 
up an online presence.

•   Enable access to broadband, particularly for underserved communities, to increase 

entrepreneurship.

48

The economic state of Latinos in the US: Determined to thriveStopping the skew: Reducing bias

Latinos continue to face bias, discrimination, and prejudice, adding a further layer of 
disadvantage they must negotiate. Structural interventions to remove or reduce bias are needed, 
such as:

•  Providing bias training to creditors, recruiting, and educational professionals, and 

developing standards for approvals that minimize bias.

•  Promoting supplier diversity and buying from Latino-owned businesses by using 

minority certificates and being active in the community.

•  Publicly disclosing demographic information and providing transparency on 

compensation, advancement, and retention.

•  Increasing Latino representation on boards and in corporate C-suites.

How companies can step up

Change requires commitment, and by implementing tangible 
actions that meet the needs of Latino consumers, these 
companies are taking steps to support their customers at 
critical moments and celebrate their identity.

Bank of America

Latinos are less likely to own property than their non-Latino 
White counterparts due to affordability issues, which in turn 
impacts their ability to build wealth. Bank of America offers 
mortgage options with zero down payments and zero closing 
payments for certain Black and Latino neighborhoods. It 
also actively recruits diverse talent and has partnered with 
200 external organizations to do so. Bank of America serves 
300,000 Hispanic-owned small businesses, and offers 
Spanish-language capabilities across 2,000 financial centers 
and on mobile channels. The annual Hispanic Small Business 
Owner Spotlight report is conducted to improve the bank’s 
services to this community.

JLo Beauty

Companies that proactively ask for customer feedback and 
tailor their products accordingly can win support from the 
discerning Latino client base. JLo Beauty organizes community 
forums where the brand listens to customer requests and tests 
new ideas. It maintains authentic social media engagement 
with Jennifer Lopez, the face of the brand, and offers a 
newsletter with an exclusive view into her life. Tailored beauty 
products, such as “Overnight Hustle”, are made with Latinas’ 
unique skin-care requirements in mind. Since its launch in 
January 2021, JLO Beauty has tripled in size and gained over  
1 percent market share.

Target

While niche brands often identify a target market segment 
to win over, large organizations can also show that they are 
responsive to customer needs. Diversified retailer Target has 
executed a dedicated Latino strategy for more than five years. 
It offers curated products made by Latino businesses, shares 
stories, and celebrates the contributions of Latino guests, 
entrepreneurs, and Target team members. It regularly carries 
more than 60 Latino-owned brands. For the past two decades, 
Target has supported a Hispanic scholarship fund.
