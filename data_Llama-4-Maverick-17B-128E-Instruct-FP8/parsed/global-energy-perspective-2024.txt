Global Energy 
Perspective 2024

About this report

The Global Energy Perspective is produced by Energy Solutions, part of McKinsey’s Global 
Energy & Materials Practice, in close collaboration with McKinsey’s Sustainability and 
Advanced Industries practices. McKinsey is committed to our position that the world requires 
a major course correction to reach climate goals aligned with the Paris Agreement, and our 
research is focused on helping global stakeholders meet those targets.

The Global Energy Perspective 2024 offers a detailed demand outlook for 68 sectors and 
78 fuels across a 1.5° pathway, as set out in the Paris Agreement, as well as three bottom-
up energy transition scenarios. The scenarios have been redesigned this year to better 
reflect changing global conditions, including geopolitical challenges, increasingly complex 
supply chains, and higher inflation. Together, they explore potential outcomes, ranging from 
a sustainable transformation—a plausible scenario where sustainability becomes a global 
priority and nations coordinate toward decarbonization, despite the challenges—through a 
continuation of the current energy transition momentum, to a slower evolution characterized 
by a fragmented response to decarbonization. Data for these scenarios come from a variety 
of sources, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Energy Institute, Eurostat, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Oxford Economics, the United Nations, 
the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the US Energy Information Administration, 
among others.

This broad range of scenarios is intended to show the implications of different pathways and 
to provide a fact base to inform decision makers. However, these scenarios are not exhaustive 
in the realm of all possible outcomes, nor will any individual scenario unfold exactly as we 
describe it. In certain cases in this report, we may highlight a particular scenario that best 
illustrates a trend, but this does not mean that we believe this scenario is more or less likely to 
reflect the actual outcome. The insights in this report are based on currently available data, 
but multiple factors could influence real-world outcomes as the energy transition continues to 
advance.

Global Energy Perspective 2024: Foreword

While significant progress has been made in the nine years since the landmark Paris 
Agreement, the global energy transition is entering a new phase, marked by rising costs, 
complexity, and increased technology challenges. To successfully navigate this next phase 
and meet the Paris Agreement goals, urgent action will be required and the pace of change 
must accelerate.1 The clean energy transition will also need to be balanced with affordability, 
energy system resiliency, and energy security in an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic 
environment.

we, really?,” there is a persistent and growing gap between low-carbon technology project 
commitments and realization, with a significant proportion of announced projects not 
reaching final investment decision (FID).5 Corporate, public, and private investors are hesitant 
about deploying capital due to softening business cases, technology cost-competitiveness, 
and project-enabling and market-forming policy support. Value chains remain constrained 
across all low-carbon technologies, impacting the availability of everything from basic 
materials to equipment. Consequently, fossil fuels will continue to supply growing energy 
demand across all our bottom-up scenarios.

Despite significant global public and private sector momentum grounded in increasingly 
ambitious policies, overcoming major physical challenges is crucial to transform today’s large 
and complex energy system. New low-carbon technologies will have to be developed and 
deployed, along with entirely new supply chains and infrastructure to support them. While 
the cost of low-carbon technologies has continued to decline in most regions, in McKinsey 
Global Institute’s recent report, “The hard stuff: Navigating the physical realities of the energy 
transition,” it is estimated that only 10 percent of the technologies required globally by 2050 
have been deployed. Most of these in promising use cases or “low-hanging fruit” where 
policy and funding have been most plentiful.2 For example, renewable energy sources (RES) 
have seen significant success. In Europe, solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment is on track 
to meet 2030 targets and solar PV build-out in Spain sits at around 30 gigawatts (GW) of 
installed capacity, which could double by 2030 at the current growth trajectory.3 China has 
also reported notable achievements in low-carbon technology deployment, with more solar 
capacity and electric vehicles (EVs) added last year than by the rest of the world combined.4 

By contrast, a new wave of less mature technologies faces costs that may inhibit large-scale 
deployment. As highlighted in McKinsey’s recent article, “The energy transition: Where are 

Successfully navigating the transition away from fossil fuels will require focusing beyond 
a single solution or technology. There are no silver bullets—the future calls for a holistic 
transformation of the global energy system by incorporating a range of proven and emerging 
levers. To do this, considerations beyond technological feasibility will need to be addressed, 
spanning capital deployment, improving business cases, ensuring economic returns, 
adjusting regulation, and establishing continued political and public support in the face of 
competing economic and societal priorities.

This report presents a view of the road ahead to serve as a fact base for stakeholders 
to navigate the opportunities and challenges of this new phase. It does not constitute 
McKinsey’s view on what should happen, but rather presents a range of scenarios that could 
plausibly play out, based on the best data currently available—recognizing that the energy 
transition is an extremely complex undertaking influenced by multiple factors. The critical 
question this research aims to address is how the world can achieve a step change in its 
efforts toward meeting net-zero goals and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

4          Global Energy Perspective 2024

Globally, net-zero targets have proliferated, and 
commitments and enthusiasm for reaching net zero are 
on the rise. However, the crucial transition technologies 
needed to achieve these targets are still not being 
deployed at the required speed. In the next phase of the 
global energy transition, low-carbon technologies need 
to scale up in an environment where capital availability 
is decreasing in light of elevated interest rates and 
geopolitical developments. To consider this evolving 
global environment, we have redesigned our energy 
transition scenarios6 to:

• 

• 

• 

present a range of plausible futures, anchored on 
credible input assumptions and the extrapolation of 
current trends 
better reflect the complexity of the energy 
transition, which is driven by multiple factors 
be used as a baseline to model additional shocks to 
the system in future, such as geopolitical changes

Our updated scenarios are primarily differentiated over 
nine dimensions across three broad areas that could 
determine the evolution of the energy transition:

• 

• 

• 

Policy: Policy ambition, energy security, and implied 
CO2 price
Technology development: Efficiency gains, 
technology cost learning curves, and novel 
technology
Potential constraints for renewables 
deployment: Technology bottlenecks, grid build-
out, and nuclear build-out

1.5° pathway

Under this scenario, a 1.5° pathway is adopted 
globally. International cooperation is mobilized to 
rapidly scale decarbonization technologies, release 
large-scale investments (including in emerging 
economies), and shift behavior. Limiting warming 
to 1.5°C is key to avoiding the worst impacts of 
climate change and doing so would require staying 
within a 570 gigaton (Gt) carbon budget, reducing 
CO2 emissions by 50 percent by 2030 compared 
to current levels—and reaching net-zero emissions 
by 2050. Other greenhouse gases, especially 
methane and nitrous oxide, would also need to be 
steeply reduced. Achieving a 1.5° pathway requires 
a substantial departure from current trends and 
significant changes to the energy demand mix, 
pace of decarbonization, and investment into 
nascent technologies, but is still possible with rapid 
global action across all economic sectors.

Sustainable Transformation

Continued Momentum

Slow Evolution

The Sustainable Transformation scenario charts a 
pathway to decarbonization based on current global 
economic conditions and technology maturity and 
viability. Here, nations intensify their commitment 
to sustainability, with increasing global coordination 
to alleviate bottlenecks, unlock investment pledges 
for low-carbon technologies, and improve energy 
efficiency above recent historical levels. Global 
cooperation to decarbonize is underscored by the 
creation of cross-regional financing, with nations 
adopting cost-efficient policies to reduce emissions. 
However, despite this momentum, practical constraints 
impose certain limits on the pace of clean technology 
adoption. For this scenario to materialize, several 
economic and technological issues would need to be 
resolved, and interim targets might not be met if not 
plausible under these assumptions.

Projected global temperature increase by 2050: 
~1.8°C

In the Continued Momentum scenario, nations’ focus 
on sustainability is balanced by other factors, including 
affordability and security of energy supply, with some 
emerging economies mostly prioritizing affordability 
and security of supply over sustainability. Technology 
and efficiency improvements largely follow current 
trends, driven by economics where practical constraints 
persist in the widespread adoption of low-carbon 
technologies. This scenario largely mirrors current 
trends and assumes they will continue, resulting in 
uneven deployment of low-carbon technologies across 
technology type and regions. This scenario would fail to 
meet the key goals of the Paris Agreement, creating a 
range of negative social, environmental, and economic 
effects.

Projected global temperature increase by 2050: 
~2.2°C

The Slow Evolution scenario sees local decision making 
focused on (domestic) energy affordability and supply 
security, relegating sustainability to a secondary 
priority. This fragmented response to decarbonization 
leads to a decrease in prior low-carbon investments, 
resulting in reduced investments into low-carbon 
technology and lower CO2 prices, which, in turn, leads 
to significant environmental, economic, and social 
impacts. Stark geographic differences emerge in this 
scenario, with some countries and regions making good 
progress toward decarbonization targets, while others 
lag behind significantly. To an even greater extent than 
the Continued Momentum scenario, if this scenario 
materializes, the key goals of the Paris Agreement 
will not be met, creating a range of severe social, 
environmental, and economic effects.

Increased energy demand and the continued 
role of fossil fuels in the energy system mean 
emissions could continue rising through 2025 to 
2035. Emissions have not yet peaked, and global 
CO2 emissions from combustion and industrial 
processes are projected to increase until around 
2025 under all our bottom-up scenarios. The 
scenarios begin to diverge toward 2030, with all 
showing a decline in emissions by 2050. Despite 
this projected decline, 2050 emissions are still 
meaningfully above net-zero targets across all 
scenarios.

The emissions decline is driven primarily by 
economic factors, particularly the increasing cost-
effectiveness of low-carbon technology in sectors 
such as power and road transport. For example, 
solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment in Europe is on 
track to reach 2030 targets, while China is making 
strides in both solar and electric vehicle (EV) 
adoption. Policy and regulations will also continue to 
contribute to the adoption of low-carbon technology 
and support a decline in emissions.

In all our bottom-up scenarios, rising emissions 
would lead to global temperature increases above 
1.5°C by 2050, from around 1.8°C in the Sustainable 
Transformation scenario, through around 2.2°C 
in Continued Momentum, to around 2.6°C in Slow 
Evolution.

Despite policy innovations, increasing global consensus, and growing private-sector 
commitments, emissions are not declining at the rate required 

Globally, emissions are rising and are projected to peak between 2025 and 2035 before 
beginning to decline, but would stay well above the carbon budget for a 1.5°C trajectory. This is 
despite the implementation of numerous carbon-mitigating policies that have translated net-zero 
commitments into legislation since the Paris Agreement, alongside increasing global consensus 
around decarbonization—with countries accounting for more than 90 percent of global GDP now 
having net-zero commitments in place—as well as growing private-sector commitments. While 
enacting effective policy to overcome a complex and multifaceted issue such as curbing emissions 
is challenging, policy and other government action is a crucial component of enabling the energy 
transition. In many cases, macrolevel climate targets are ambitious (such as EU and US net-zero 
commitments by 2050) but these may not be sufficiently translated at lower-level regions and 
jurisdictions. Local internal combustion engine (ICE) bans or RES targets, for example, can meet 
opposition on the ground due to consumer affordability, grid congestion, and manufacturing 
capacity. Additionally, rising energy demand in emerging economies, particularly in the Association 
of Southeast Asian (ASEAN) countries, India, and the Middle East, means carbon-mitigating 
policy in these regions will be important in curbing emissions. That said, net-zero goals in these 
regions tend to stretch further into the future than in more mature economies. Other differences 
between mature and emerging economies are also still prominent, such as in the financing of low-
carbon technologies. Taking all of this into account, existing policy and legislation may need to be 
reexamined to enable the energy transition at speed and at scale.  

Energy demand is projected to grow by up to 18 percent through 2050

Over the next two decades, our analysis shows that global energy demand composition will shift, 
mainly driven by growth in energy consumption from emerging economies. This demand growth 
is primarily due to increasing populations, rising GDP (and energy consumption) per capita, and 
the growth and relocation of manufacturing industries to emerging economies. Nevertheless, 
per capita consumption in these regions is projected to remain below that of mature economies, 
driven by increasing energy efficiency, such as switching from fossils to low-carbon energy 
sources in ASEAN countries and electrification in China. In mature economies, as well as in China, 
overall demand is projected to flatten in the short to medium term. However, there are several 
forces at work that could affect the demand trajectory in different regions. In the United States, 
industrial resurgence would drive demand growth through electrification, while in Europe, by 
contrast, continued deindustrialization would lead to declining demand in the region. Globally, new 
demand sources, such as data centers (driven by the rise of AI), are also projected to contribute to 
increased demand.

Fossil fuel demand continues, with a previously anticipated peak in the late 2020s now 
turning into a decade-spanning plateau 

Low-carbon energy sources are set to grow, but not currently fast enough to meet net-zero 
goals due to business case viability and other challenges 

The build-out of clean energy technologies has not been fast enough to supply growing global 
energy demand. Consequently, fossil fuels will continue to be used across all our bottom-up 
scenarios, meeting 40 to 60 percent of global energy demand by 2050. Continued oil demand 
is projected to be driven primarily by a slowdown in EV adoption relative to historical numbers in 
some geographies, due to high costs and rollout challenges. Gas will continue to be used for power 
generation to provide firmness for an energy system with increased penetration of intermittent 
renewables, and gas distribution for heating will be migrated to electric load over the medium 
to long term. Overall, fossil fuel demand is expected to plateau between 2025 and 2035 before 
declining, with the timing and rate of the decline differing by scenario. This demand picture means 
fossil fuel investments will continue across scenarios and remain a critical part of the energy 
landscape to support an orderly energy transition that is affordable, reliable, and competitive.

Low-carbon energy sources are projected to grow, accounting for 65 to 80 percent of global 
power generation by 2050. However, this growth is not fast enough under current conditions to 
meet short-term deployment targets. Growth rates are also projected to differ by technology. 
Those technologies for which the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is already low at the point of 
production, such as solar, wind, and energy storage systems, are projected to continue to grow, 
while those with higher cost—including hydrogen and other sustainable fuels, and carbon capture, 
utilization, and storage (CCUS)—lack sufficient demand and policy support for strong growth. 
Solar stands out with particularly strong growth projections, while hydrogen growth to 2050 has 
been revised downward by 10 to 25 percent compared to previous estimates due to higher cost 
projections. Overall, low-carbon energy sources face several challenges that could threaten net-
zero goals, and which are particularly pronounced for those with higher LCOE. Weak business 
cases for new installations where future revenues and technology costs are uncertain put the 
project pipeline at risk. Other challenges include rising capital costs, longer project timelines, 
and the need for grid build-out. For instance, in the European Union and the United States, all 
operational, under-construction, and announced on- and off-shore wind capacity may still be 
200 GW short of 2030 targets. Overcoming these hurdles could require the support of durable 
and flexible policy to facilitate continued deployment. Our analysis suggests that all elements—
including renewable energy, other low-carbon energy sources, energy efficiency gains, and carbon 
capture—will be required to achieve the goals of the transition while providing energy security.

Nuclear could play a significant role in the transition, but faces headwinds in policy and public 
sentiment

Nuclear power could be a key driver of decarbonization—it is virtually carbon free and, given the 
same level of investment, generates more power than most other low-carbon energy sources. In 
addition, nuclear power is firm, and next-generation nuclear power projects, such as small modular 
reactors and molten salt reactors, show efficiency gains and lower waste generation. However, 
unless several policy bottlenecks are overcome and public sentiment shifts, nuclear build-out 
will come too late to make a meaningful difference in the energy transition. Growth in nuclear 
power is projected to be almost flat to 2050 due to more stringent regulatory requirements than 
for other low-carbon energy sources, negative public perception, perceived safety issues, supply 
chain constraints, and uncertainty around waste disposal. In Europe, for example, nuclear build-
out has been slow and expensive, as a scarcity of projects has resulted in execution gaps across 
all stakeholders. While the outlook for nuclear could improve in the longer term (2050 to 2100), 
overcoming current hurdles could help to advance the energy transition more quickly.  

The global cost of carbon is too low to be compatible with faster transition scenarios

Current mechanisms in place to create a global carbon market are largely ineffective in driving 
emissions reductions. The global carbon price is at present too low for our faster decarbonization 
pathways to materialize and is not compatible with a 1.5º pathway. The market is also constrained 
by a lack of liquidity, particularly on the demand side. Unless the current carbon price is 
reexamined, the global carbon market will not be effective in driving the decarbonization required 
for the conditions of faster scenarios to be met, particularly the at-scale uptake of CCUS. Our 
analysis suggests that the carbon price would need to rise to $150 to $225 per ton of CO2, varying 
by region depending on local costs for low-carbon technology and clean energy prices.

The transition cannot proceed at speed and at scale without addressing raw materials supply 
chains, manufacturing, and geopolitical developments 

A set of interconnected challenges needs to be overcome to unlock a pathway to net zero. Supply 
chains are becoming increasingly interconnected, and energy security is a pressing issue for many 
countries. As a result, multiple parallel supply chains for crucial materials are forming, reinforced 
by domestic demand. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are experiencing high demand 
for new low-carbon energy installation components but are also facing substantial backlogs. 
Demand may therefore be challenged both in terms of speed and scale by the availability of critical 
components that enable low-carbon energy build-out. Geopolitical challenges could further 
impact global supply chains and shift focus to energy security.

The scale-up of critical materials faces constraints, including lack of viable business cases

Low-carbon technologies often require different materials than those embedded in conventional 
technologies, such as battery materials (primarily lithium, nickel, and cobalt) and magnet materials 
(mainly rare earth), with these materials accounting for less than 20 percent of global metals 
and mining revenue, which is led by steel and thermal coal.  The scale-up of some raw materials 
is constrained by the long development timelines of greenfield assets. And for cases where 
supply is likely to be sufficient, prices may have to increase to make business cases viable. A 
major challenge for the extraction and processing of critical materials is the uncertainty around 
long-term demand profiles, which creates hesitation among investors and weakens business 
cases for new mining and refining assets. This unclear demand picture is impacted by the rapid 
development of downstream technology, geopolitical uncertainties, and local political instability in 
some geographies. For the energy transition to succeed, business cases would need to be robust 
enough to enable sufficient materials to be extracted and processed at the scale required to 
enable the build-out of low-carbon energy sources. For more, read our companion report, Global 
Materials Perspective 2024.

Energy demand

Global energy demand is growing faster than expected, and a more challenging geopolitical 
landscape—combined with the emergence of new sources of demand and smaller-than-
expected efficiency gains—means that the evolution of demand growth could see rapid 
changes in unexpected directions. 

Global energy demand is projected to grow by up to 18 percent through 2050. Most of this 
growth will come from emerging economies, where growing populations and a strengthening 
middle class will result in higher energy demand. The relocation of manufacturing industries 
from mature to emerging economies will further shift demand to these economies, too. The 
rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its future trajectory could also significantly influence 
demand, with uncertainty still surrounding its future impact. How this new demand is met will 
set the trajectory of the energy transition.

Developments in emerging economies, particularly ASEAN countries, India, and the Middle 
East, are critical, given that these regions are projected to drive between 66 and 95 percent 
of energy demand growth to 2050, depending on the scenario. A substantial part of this 
growth is projected to come from ASEAN countries, cementing the region as a key energy 
demand center—further reshaping global energy trade flows and increasing the region’s 
geopolitical importance. 

In Europe, on the other hand, overall energy demand has been flat or declining for some time. 
If energy prices remain high, the expected demand trajectory may not materialize. While the 
European Union has seen significant decarbonization, energy prices are still around two to 
three times higher than historical averages and could grow to more than double those in the 
United States in the long run, contributing to a potential lack of industrial competitiveness 
in the region. This raises important questions around how to achieve decarbonization while 
supporting economic growth.

Uncertainty in the global energy demand outlook is also impacted by the emergence of new 
demand centers, the most striking of which is the rise of AI and the associated boom in data 
centers. The effect that AI could have on future energy demand could vary substantially 
depending on the growth trajectories of its many applications, as well as those of other 
technologies. Our research estimates that the rise of cloud solutions, cryptocurrency, and 
AI could see data centers accounting for 2,500 to 4,500 terawatt hours (TWh) of global 
electricity demand by 2050 (5 to 9 percent of total electricity demand). New demand 
centers such as these can have unpredictable effects on the energy system—for example, 
data centers are mostly powered by electricity (with backup generators) and have constant 
demand, creating greater need for gas or other firming sources of energy to balance out the 
intermittency of RES. 

AI could create between $10 trillion and $15 trillion of economic value annually across the 
global economy, while generative AI (gen AI) alone could create between $2.5 trillion and $4.5 
trillion annually.8 However, realizing even a quarter of this potential by the end of the decade 
would require an additional 50 to 75 GW of data center infrastructure worldwide. Unleashing 
the full economic potential of AI will require sufficient supply of clean electricity to meet 
burgeoning demand from data centers, as well as the associated grid infrastructure.

Electrification is accelerating—our analysis suggests that between 2023 and 2050, 
electricity consumption could more than double in slower energy transition scenarios and 
nearly triple in faster scenarios. This is in comparison to total energy consumption growth of 
12 to 21 percent over the same period, depending on the scenario. Electrification is a key lever 
for increasing energy efficiency, but the uptake of electrification technologies, including heat 
pumps and EVs, has slowed despite ongoing investment (energy efficiency investments in 
2022 increased by 16 percent to $600 billion).9

Energy demand

Although the drivers of global energy demand are multifaceted and liable to change, 
governments will play an important role in shaping future demand. While regulatory certainty 
is critical for unlocking investment, governments also need to respond to the ever-evolving 
reality of the energy transition and adapt in a predictable and well-defined way to evolving 
variables in the system, such as interest rates and capture prices. The right balance will need 
to be struck between policy stability and regulatory responsiveness. 

How the world will meet the projected increase in energy demand is one of the key questions 
of the energy transition. Both RES and new fossil fuels build-out will be required to ensure 
demand is met by supply, and nuclear power could play a bigger role in the years beyond 
2050. However, for all these energy sources, lengthy project timelines and higher interest 
rates could add costs and put project execution at risk. 

All of this has important implications for emissions. As a result of rising energy demand, 
slower-than-expected efficiency gains and the continued role of fossil fuels in the energy 
mix, emissions have not yet peaked. By 2050, emissions remain substantially above a level 
compatible with a 1.5° pathway in all our bottom-up scenarios, emphasizing the ongoing need 
for a major course correction in the energy transition.

Global energy demand10 is projected to grow by 
between 11 percent (in the Continued Momentum 
scenario) and 18 percent (in the Slow Evolution 
scenario) by 2050. This is driven by increased 
demand in emerging economies, especially in the 
ASEAN region, India, and the Middle East, among 
others. Africa is also projected to see significant 
growth in energy demand, but still accounts for 
a small fraction of global energy demand since 
it is growing from a current low base. In contrast 
to recent decades, demand growth in China is 
projected to be largely flat and more in line with 
demand growth in Europe and North America. 

Historically, emerging economies have had 
low energy demand compared to more mature 
economies but are now seeing an increase linked 
to population growth (1.5 billion by 2050) and 
economic development contributing to increased 
affluence and higher living standards. In Africa, 
ASEAN countries, India, and the Middle East, GDP 
per capita is projected to increase by between 1.0 
and 4.5 percent per annum over the same period. 
Together, these factors are projected to result 
in higher total energy demand globally by 2050, 
despite energy efficiency gains.

The increase in consumption is largely due to the 
same fundamentals underlying global energy 
demand: population growth and increasing GDP per 
capita. The extent of this growth in consumption 
varies significantly by scenario due to differences in 
energy efficiency and electrification.

Electrification of the energy system results in a 
reduction in final energy consumption due to the 
more efficient use of energy. Electricity is projected 
to become the largest source of energy by 2050 
across scenarios, with consumption coming from 
traditional sectors (for example, electrification of 
buildings) as well as newer sectors (such as data 
centers, EVs, and green hydrogen). 

Despite the uptake of electrification, fossil fuels are 
projected to continue to account for a significant 
share of the energy mix to 2050.

The rapid rise of cloud solutions, cryptocurrency, 
and AI is set to lead to significant growth for data 
centers globally. By 2030, there is projected to 
be a 150 GW capacity of graphic processing units 
(GPUs) for data centers globally, and data centers 
could account for up to 4,500 TWh of electricity 
consumption by 2050 (5 to 9 percent of total 
electricity consumption). 

Data centers could be a significant driver of power 
demand growth in several regions. In Europe, 
for instance, data centers are projected to be 
the primary near-term growth driver for power 
demand—with most of this for clean electricity. 
Meeting this clean power demand will be crucial 
to enable the full economic potential of AI and will 
require the build-out of sufficient clean power 
sources and associated grid infrastructure. 

Under the Continued Momentum scenario, global 
green hydrogen consumption is projected to 
increase to 179 megatons per annum (Mtpa) by 
2050, up from less than 1 Mtpa today and 5 Mtpa 
in 2030. This could lead to a growth in power 
consumption of 20 percent per year for the sector.

Electricity consumption in transport could grow 
by around 10 percent annually in the Continued 
Momentum scenario, driven by increased 
penetration of EVs. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) 
are projected to account for most global passenger 
car sales by 2050, up from 13 percent today.

system, particularly transmission and distribution 
(T&D) infrastructure. Investment is expected to grow 
at 3 to 4 percent CAGR. 

Capital spend for fossil fuels is projected to 
continue under all scenarios in the short to 
medium term. This will help to ensure that there is

intermittency as renewables make up a bigger share 
of the global energy system.

Low-carbon energy sources 

Meeting the growing global demand for energy will require a significant build-out of RES 
along with other low-carbon energy sources. However, a set of new and existing challenges 
to RES build-out will need to be overcome to ensure the energy transition continues at pace. 
While RES are now cheaper and make up a larger part of the energy mix than ever before, 
more work is needed around the economic viability of some RES business cases.

To better understand the complex economics of RES build-out, this year’s iteration of the 
Global Energy Perspective includes an analysis of grid costs, alongside generation costs. 
In many cases, the build-out of a supporting grid, rather than RES installation itself, may be 
the limiting factor for new RES. Renewables projects require extensive grid build-out, often 
in areas away from centers of demand, with important implications for costs and project 
timelines (for more detail on grid costs, see Bottlenecks section).

Power pricing is another emerging challenge affecting energy systems with a high penetration 
of renewables. The comparatively lower marginal costs of RES mean that the price of 
electricity tends toward zero—or even negative pricing—at certain times of day. For new RES 
installations, this could potentially impact the business case, requiring electricity providers 
to derisk their positions. In some scenarios, including those with the most cost-effective 
decarbonization pathways, our analysis shows that new RES build-out would not have a 
positive business case without regulatory intervention. The macroeconomic landscape for 
RES build-out has also changed. Capital has become more expensive in recent years, further 
affecting new RES build-out, which tends to be more capital expenditure (capex) intensive 
than traditional energy sources, particularly for off- and onshore wind. Despite these 
challenges, renewables growth remains strong, supported by governments’ decarbonization 
targets and boosted by new demand for clean power, though the pace and extent of growth 
remains uncertain.

To supply projected energy demand and increase the viability of RES-based power systems, 
stakeholders now need to consider how to build a fully running and reliable energy system 
based on renewables. Here, emerging economies have an opportunity to build a renewables-
based system from the ground up to meet their burgeoning energy needs, potentially 
leapfrogging some of the constraints imposed by adapting a preexisting energy system to 
run on renewables. Doing so would require conscious planning; purposeful, pragmatic action; 
and a supportive policy environment to ensure that a renewables-based energy system could 
meet rapidly growing demand. 

Considerable progress has been made on the policy front. In many mature economies, 
industrial policy is now anchoring climate technologies as a core pillar and substantial public 
funds are being earmarked for their development. In Europe, for instance, the European 
Green Deal, introduced in 2019, aims to make the European Union climate-neutral by 2050, 
with intermediate Fit for 55 targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55 
percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.11 In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act 
(IRA) of 2022 provided total climate-related spending of almost $370 billion over ten years, 
with the aim of cutting emissions by 40 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels.12 In addition, the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has allocated billions toward modernizing the energy 
grid, expanding EV infrastructure and enhancing energy efficiency across sectors.13 Together 
with continued cost improvement, including through innovation, these and other policy 
initiatives are leading to progress in the deployment of low-carbon power.14

Achieving firmness in a renewables-based system introduces another complex challenge. 
The business case for firming capacity, such as from gas or battery electric storage systems 
(BESS), needs to make sense and be supported by government and correct market design. 
Even though a renewables-based system may be cheaper than a fossil-based one, the need

Low-carbon energy sources 

for firmness is nontrivial—and this, in combination with the required grid investment, could 
make the final cost of power for the consumer higher than previously anticipated. Policy 
and regulation can play a role in ensuring the build-out of low-carbon firm energy sources is 
feasible, with robust business cases that result in affordable power for end users. Additionally, 
BESS and other long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies could play an important 
role in meeting demand located far from the grid and in balancing a renewables-based 
system.

Despite the many challenges facing them, low-carbon energy sources are still projected to 
experience significant growth, accounting for the majority of the global power mix by 2050. 
However, this growth will not be evenly distributed among the various low-carbon energy 
sources:

• 

Solar is projected to make up the bulk of the global renewable power mix in 2050, at 
16,000 to 30,000 TWh, due to decreasing equipment costs, increased flow of private 
equity capital into solar, coupling to BESS, and the easing of permitting processes. 
The penetration of solar varies by region—China stands out from an absolute volume 
perspective, with far more solar installed than other regions. However, solar still makes 
up a relatively lower share of the Chinese power mix than in regions that have less 
absolute capacity, such as the European Union and the United States.

•  Hydrogen demand growth is projected to be slower than previously anticipated—10 
to 25 percent lower in 2050, depending on the scenario—driven by reductions in 
projected demand across sectors, particularly road transport and buildings. Increased 
capital costs, lower learning rates, more expensive electrolyzer capex, and higher RES 
costs have driven up the cost of green hydrogen by 20 to 40 percent. Some lingering 
uncertainty around regulations also remains. While future hydrogen demand will be 
greater than it is now, our analysis shows that this slower growth would mean the 
associated demand for power for hydrogen production would be lower than previously 
anticipated, too, though also still greater than today.

•  Other sustainable fuels are projected to see significant growth, particularly in hard-
to-abate transportation segments such as aviation, maritime, and heavy-duty road 
transport. Growth to 2030 is mainly driven by policy already in place or proposed, while 
long-term growth will depend on future regulations and technological advancements. 
Most of the growth is projected to come from new technologies and advanced or waste 
feedstocks, requiring a fundamental change in how clean fuels are produced today. 
Feedstock for sustainable fuels is likely to continue to be the major bottleneck to 
deployment, and governments are set to play a critical role in the evolution of sustainable 
fuel demand.

22          Global Energy Perspective 2024

Renewables currently account for 32 percent of global 
power generation and are projected to grow to between 
65 and 80 percent by 2050, depending on the scenario. 
This growth is primarily driven by the lower cost of RES, 
though policy and incentives also play a role. Clean firm 
power generation—which includes gas and coal plants 
with CCUS, nuclear, and hydrogen—is also projected to 
make up a relatively larger share of the energy system 
in 2050, with a projected growth rate of 4 percent per 
annum. 

Installed capacity will need to be sufficient to cover 
peak demand, given it does not correspond one-to-one 
with generation for any power supply. This is particularly 
marked for renewables, as the intermittency of RES 
means there can be a large difference between 
capacity and generation. RES (without time-shift 
battery systems) can only cover peak demand during 
RES operating hours, which might not correspond with 
the demand peak in any given day. And, to enable new-
generation projects to come online, significant grid 
build-out will also be required. 

Ensuring firmness is another key consideration for 
a renewables-based system. Gas is likely to play a 
key role in providing firmness to the system as it can 
be deployed quickly, allowing the system to respond 
rapidly to supply shortages. However, the business 
case for installing gas capacity with low utilization may 
not be viable in some situations, potentially requiring 
government intervention to ensure that RES systems 
(with their characteristic intermittency) are enabled by 
the necessary firming capacity.

23        Global Energy Perspective 2024

As renewable penetration increases over time, 
the distribution of hourly prices is projected 
to be impacted in two different ways. First, an 
increasing number of hours is expected when RES 
set the price, driving the spot price toward zero 
or even into the negative in Europe; and second, 
a decreasing number of hours when combined 
cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) are operating. This 
trend creates uncertainty over the future business 
case for renewables technologies (including future 
revenues and technology costs) and could put 
renewables projects in the pipeline at risk. High 
solar penetration in California has led to significant 
periods of negative pricing, particularly in the colder 
months during mild weather when demand is muted 
but irradiation is strong. 

For example, in 2025, RES are projected to set the 
price 5 percent of the time, with CCGTs setting the 
price between 60 and 70 percent of the time. By 
2035, RES are projected to set the price 20 percent 
of the time, with CCGTs only setting the price 35 
percent of the time.

For providers, this could mean that business 
cases for new RES installation may not be viable, 
particularly where build-out is done on a merchant 
(rather than derisked) basis. Developers could even 
lose revenue through noncompensated energy 
curtailments where there is a mismatch between 
supply and demand.

Hydrogen demand is projected to grow two- to 
fourfold by 2050, driven by increasing demand in 
existing sectors and emerging demand from new 
sectors where clean hydrogen will be necessary for 
decarbonization. The large majority of this future 
demand is projected to be for green hydrogen, 
accounting for 50 to 70 percent of total demand, 
depending on the scenario.

Although this growth is significant, it is 10 to 
25 percent lower than previously anticipated. 
Projected growth has been revised downward 
due to fundamental cost increases that have 
disproportionally affected hydrogen, as well as 
some continued uncertainty around regulation. 
Demand is projected to be lower than expected 
across sectors, but particularly in road transport 
and buildings. 

By sector, road transport could drive around 15 
percent of hydrogen demand growth until 2050, 
driven by the uptake of fuel cell EVs. 

Aviation is expected to account for around 5 to 15 
percent of hydrogen-based energy demand by 
2050 due to demand for hydrogen for synthetic 
kerosene production.

Iron and steel are projected to account for around 
10 to 15 percent of total hydrogen demand growth, 
driven by uptake of clean direct reduced iron (DRI) 
steel production.

16  Indonesia is pushing the maximum blending rate of bioliquids from 35 to 40 percent (mainly FAME in diesel).

25        Global Energy Perspective 2024

Across scenarios, sustainable fuels (excluding clean 
hydrogen) are expected to play an increasingly important 
role in transportation, including in hard-to-abate sectors, 
such as aviation, maritime, and heavy duty road transport. 
The share of gasoline has already started to decline in 
Europe, potentially leading to lower demand for conventional 
biofuels, too (however, new applications could prolong their 
market contribution).

The most resilient outlook for sustainable fuels is projected 
to be in road transport. The variability between scenarios is 
largely driven by less mature markets like aviation, maritime, 
and chemicals. To 2030, the uptake of sustainable fuels will 
mainly be driven by regulation already proposed. The long-
term contribution of sustainable fuels to decarbonization 
is expected to be shaped by future regulations (including 
subsidies, mandates, and tax credits) as well as 
technological advancement. 

The sustainable fuels picture varies by geography. In Brazil, 
India, Indonesia, and the United States, strong support of 
the local agricultural industry is projected to result in a 30 
to 40 percent growth in demand by 2030, driven by use 
cases such as the introduction of ethanol flex cars in Brazil 
and India, and pushing the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) 
blend-wall limits in Indonesia.16

Feedstock availability is a key bottleneck for sustainable 
fuels. In faster scenarios, unlocking new feedstocks would 
be necessary as soon as 2030 to meet growing demand. 
With limited waste oil availability, the role of edible oils, 
synthetic fuels, and new pathways (including gasification-
Fischer Tropsch or ethanol-to-jet) will be substantial 
after 2040. Declines in production costs could enable 
decarbonization through the uptake of sustainable fuels.

Fossil fuels 

Despite progress in RES build-out, the energy transition has been slower than expected in 
certain areas, and key transition levers are not yet mature, scalable, or cost-effective. This, 
combined with the constraints facing renewables build-out and growing energy demand, 
means renewables alone are not currently projected to be sufficient to meet the world’s future 
energy needs in all our bottom-up scenarios. Fossil fuels are therefore projected to continue 
to play a role, albeit a moderating one, in the global energy system to 2050. Analysis of the 
data shows that investment and capital flow into fossil fuels are projected to continue for at 
least the next ten years to ensure the global energy system can keep up with demand.

This continued role of fossil fuels will vary by region. While mature economies may be able 
to absorb the growing costs of the energy transition, current data indicate that for some 
developing economies fossil fuels are the most viable option to ensure affordability and 
support economic growth and development—particularly under the Slow Evolution scenario, 
where the cost of low-carbon technologies is expected to be the highest, but also to a lesser 
extent in the faster scenarios. This could lead to increased emissions in these regions, 
potentially jeopardizing their Paris Agreement goals.

This means that future fossil fuel demand in 2030 is best characterized as a decade-spanning 
plateau rather than a peak, with the duration of this plateau varying by scenario. Reducing 
the duration of this plateau will depend on several levers, including accelerated electrification 
of the economy, particularly in transport (EV adoption) and faster industrial heat pump 
deployment, enhanced adoption of bio and synfuels in difficult-to-abate sectors such as 
heavy transport and other industrial segments, and accelerated build-out of RES in the power 
sector.

In this context, underinvestment in fossil fuels could result in energy demand challenges and 
lead to concerns around energy security and achieving an orderly energy transition that is 
affordable, reliable, and competitive. It is increasingly clear from our analysis that the energy 
system is not a zero-sum game—our analysis shows that both fossil fuels and RES will form 
part of the energy mix for the foreseeable future, with fossil fuels projected to meet the 
demand unable to be met by RES due to slow build-out, and to provide firming capacity for 
renewables-based energy systems.

Further, in the current context, geopolitical factors have brought increasing attention to 
fossil fuels. Countries are now working on balancing their sustainability goals with the 
considerations of energy independence, affordability, reliability, and security. In this context, 
many will consider all available energy sources.

Nevertheless, the costs of continued dependence on unabated fossil fuels cannot be 
measured in monetary terms alone. The climate consequences and subsequent negative 
social impact associated with the continued use of unabated fossil fuels must be considered, 
too. If fossil fuel growth follows a trajectory similar to the projections in the slower energy 
transition scenarios, investment into CCUS and energy efficiency would become more 
important to mitigate the potential climate impacts of continued fossil fuel demand. However, 
even with CCUS and energy-efficiency gains, key goals of the Paris Agreement would not 
be met if a slower scenario materializes—and this would create a range of negative social, 
environmental, and economic effects. The world now needs to chart a careful path to ensure 
that the continued use of fossil fuels can remain compatible with climate goals that aim to 
drastically reduce CO2 and methane emissions to limit global warming.

26          Global Energy Perspective 2024

Fossil fuels 

The demand trajectory for fossil fuels varies substantially by fuel:

•  Gas demand continues to grow into the 2030s across scenarios, as long-term price 

•  Oil demand has seen record high growth in recent years due to the global economic 

recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil demand is projected to continue to grow 
in the short term, albeit at a more moderate rate, before plateauing at around 102 million 
barrels per day (MMb/d)—similar to current levels—or up to 108 MMb/d (6 percent higher 
than current levels). This difference in oil demand projections is largely driven by the rate 
of EV penetration, with lower oil demand scenarios having a faster penetration of EVs. 
For example, 40 percent of new cars sold by 2030 in the Slow Evolution scenario will be 
EVs, compared to 68 percent of new cars in the Sustainable Transformation scenario. 
The plateau in oil demand lasts until the mid-2030s, with the plateau happening later 
in slower scenarios, after which oil demand is projected to begin its decline across all 
modeled scenarios. Although light vehicles and power are expected to drive an overall 
decline in oil demand, the chemicals and heavy transport sectors could see continued 
growth in demand to 2050. New supply would be needed to meet this continuing oil 
demand, at least in the short to medium term, even in faster energy transition scenarios. 

• 

competitiveness and lower-than-expected hydrogen demand keeps gas in the energy 
mix—especially in power generation and for heat in industry and in buildings, where 
heat pump installation is experiencing bottlenecks. Gas is also projected to play a key 
role in providing firming capacity for renewables-based systems, as it can be deployed 
much more quickly than alternatives. On the supply side, the demand for gas will result 
in increasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) needs as supply and demand regions diverge 
geographically. Future gas supply could be significantly affected by geopolitical 
developments. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has affected gas supply and 
prices, and future developments could further affect global gas trade flows. Tightness in 
the LNG market is projected to emerge in the early 2030s.
Coal demand is projected to remain at close to current levels for the next two to three 
years, driven largely by the refiring of coal plants in the past few years in response to 
higher prices for alternative fuels, partially as the result of geopolitical challenges. 
However, coal demand is expected to decline during this decade under all scenarios. In 
many regions, coal will remain cost-competitive unless regulations such as carbon taxes 
are put into place.

accounts for 40 to 60 percent of total energy demand in 2050

While RES are projected to make up a significant 
and increasing share of the energy mix, under all 
modeled scenarios RES remain insufficient to meet 
growing energy demand while also displacing the 
current energy system.

Consequently, fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas, 
and coal, will likely still be needed to meet between 
40 to 60 percent of global energy demand in 2050, 
depending on the scenario, down from 78 percent 
in 2023.

Fossil fuel demand is expected to plateau between 
2025 and 2035 before declining, with the timing 
and rate of the decline differing by scenario.

Oil demand is projected to continue to grow in 
the short term, albeit at a more moderate rate, 
before plateauing between 2025 and 2030 
in the Continued Momentum or Sustainable 
Transformation scenarios, and later in the slower 
scenario.

Gas demand continues to grow into the 2030s 
across scenarios, and coal demand is projected to 
remain at close to current levels for the next two 
to three years, but begins to decline during this 
decade under all scenarios.

After a plateau between around 2025 and 2035, oil 
demand is expected to decline by 2050 across all 
scenarios. Key drivers of oil demand decline include 
EV uptake, continued plastic recycling, and an 
increase in demand for sustainable fuels. 

By 2050, BEVs are projected to account for 99 
percent of global passenger vehicle sales in the 
Continued Momentum scenario, up from 13 percent 
today and 71 percent in 2030. The share of plastics 
recycled globally is projected to remain at roughly 
the same level as today, at 16 percent, in the same 
scenario. However, alternative fuels are projected 
to see significant growth—in aviation, the share 
of alternative fuels is projected to increase to 14 
percent in the Continued Momentum scenario, up 
from 0 percent today and 5 percent in 2030.

Our analysis shows that new, additional supply 
will likely be needed to meet oil demand in all our 
bottom-up scenarios. This is because the decline 
in existing oil fields would exceed the decline in oil 
demand across the scenarios, at least until 2040. 

In the Sustainable Transformation scenario, this 
could mean an additional 11 MMb/d of new supply 
in 2040, coming mainly from the Middle East and 
North America. In scenarios where more supply 
is needed, it would likely come from deepwater 
reservoirs in, among other places, South America 
and West Africa.

Analysis of the data shows that ending investment in 
oil would not reduce energy demand but likely lead 
to energy shortages as demand outstrips supply. If 
this supply were not to materialize, it could result in 
higher oil prices and even a lack of energy access in 
some regions.

The demand for natural gas is projected to see 
continued growth, mostly driven by demand for blue 
hydrogen (hydrogen produced from natural gas with 
CCUS) and gas-fired power generation.

By 2050, blue hydrogen demand is projected 
to grow to between 40 and 100 Mtpa globally, 
depending on the scenario, up from less than 1 Mtpa 
today and between 1 and 10 Mtpa in 2030.

Installed gas-fired power generation capacity is also 
projected to increase, reaching 3.0 terawatts (TW) 
in 2050, up from 1.5 TW today and 2.0 TW in 2030.

Gas is expected to continue playing a role in 
industrial applications, especially in high-heat 
applications where heat pumps are not a viable 
solution, and where green hydrogen may not 
make sense economically. However, alternative 
technologies for electrification of high temperature 
heat and steam may emerge.

Bottlenecks 

Maintaining or accelerating the pace of the global energy transition will require overcoming 
several bottlenecks impacting the continued uptake of low-carbon technologies. The global 
energy system is fragile, lacks redundancy, and is highly complex, all of which means that 
bottlenecks could have significant effects if they go unresolved. Additionally, as the energy 
transition progresses, difficult trade-offs will need to be made between multiple objectives, 
including affordability, reliability, industrial competitiveness, and energy security. The major 
bottlenecks identified affect electricity generation, as discussed in Chapter 2, but other low-
carbon energy sources, for example, sustainable fuels and key low-carbon technologies such 
as EV batteries, face bottlenecks of their own. 

Because bottlenecks are, in general, caused by the lack of affordability and strong business 
cases, a common thread in solving them is ensuring a viable business case for technology 
uptake or build-out, with the right policy and financial frameworks and incentives in 
place—and willingness from stakeholders to adopt these solutions. Pragmatic and adaptive 
regulation, informed by the evolving energy transition landscape, could also be an important 
component in resolving bottlenecks.

The net-zero transition is also changing the materials demand profile as low-carbon 
technologies require more and different materials than conventional technologies. Low-
carbon technologies are often more material-intense than conventional technologies, and 
typically require a diverse set of metals and minerals, including materials that only accounted 
for a small share of metals demand in the past, such as battery materials (including lithium, 
nickel, and cobalt) or magnet materials (rare earth minerals). Together, these account for 
only a small percentage of the global mining value pool today. The business economics for 
extracting these resources will need to be viable and extraction needs to be environmentally 
sustainable. With downstream technology developing quickly and sometimes in unexpected 
ways, knowing where to invest remains challenging. Across all low-carbon technologies, this 
uncertainty creates hesitancy where business cases remain unproven. 

The availability of an appropriately skilled workforce is another bottleneck for both 
renewables and fossil fuels. These industries may struggle to attract skilled workers, with new 
talent choosing to work in less traditional sectors and older workers retiring. 

As electrification continues, significant grid build-out will be needed. Electrification requires 
purpose-built and resilient grids that can connect new RES and support bidirectional flows—
requiring a significant amount of infrastructure to be built. Achieving this required build-out 
may be challenging in many areas, resulting in grid congestion and preventing new RES 
projects from being connected to the grid. 

The grid build-out needed to enable the uptake of electrification requires significant 
capital. T&D investments would need to grow about threefold by 2050 to recover from 
underinvestment and to accommodate intermittent RES. This would result in an increase 
in the share of grid cost in total average delivered power costs to customers. Demand 
management, such as demand-side response (DSR), could alleviate increases in delivered 
power cost as share of grid cost rises. The acceleration of technologies that can increase 
the capacity of new or existing grids could also be an important part of the solution, both in 
the near and longer terms. However, the deployment of these new technologies may require 
changes in grid regulation, particularly a move away from regulatory asset base (RAB), as this 
assumes a constant relationship between investment into infrastructure and energy moved.

Another factor affecting electrification is the recent slowdown in the growth of electrification 
technologies, including EVs, heat pumps, and electrolyzers, driven by reduced demand. If 
the expected electricity demand does not materialize, this could result in more emissions 
throughout the economy, a lack of learning opportunities to decrease costs, and increased 
uncertainty in power demand—making it more difficult to build new clean energy projects.

32          Global Energy Perspective 2024

Bottlenecks 

Globally, there has been a large uptake in LNG (eight times faster than the growth of total gas 
demand), but several bottlenecks need to be overcome to enable LNG uptake to continue. 
LNG requires a large amount of infrastructure, including regasification plants, ships, and 
harbor infrastructure. These investments are capital intensive, and a lack of required 
infrastructure or delays in deployment could cause a return to more emissions-heavy fuels—
as seen during Europe’s recent energy crisis, when several countries refired coal plants to 
meet their energy needs.

Nuclear, meanwhile, is facing bottlenecks in every part of the value chain. Since most of 
the nuclear fuel value chain is geographically managed in China and Russia, geopolitical 
challenges could be a major barrier to growth. More uranium exploration and refining would 
be needed, and attracting new, appropriately skilled talent would be necessary to facilitate 
growth—a challenge, given the aging nuclear workforce. Negative public perception, as well 
as concerns around safety and how to deal with waste, would also need to be resolved. And 
even if they were, permitting for next-generation projects (including small scale reactors and 
salt reactors) takes longer, given these risks.

As a result of these factors, one major cross-cutting bottleneck facing the energy transition 
is a lack of firm commitment to project pipelines—not helped by concerns surrounding project 
economics and long-term returns, and much less by the fact that there is no precedent for the 
global energy transition. Despite significant announced investment and a supportive policy 
environment, this lack of firm commitment could put a significant number of RES projects at 
risk. Currently, less than half of the deployment pipeline to 2030 for low-carbon power has 
reached FID.

Increased T&D investments will be needed, increasing the 
share of grid cost in system costs for power to customers
Rapidly increasing grid costs negate significant declines in generation 
Congested grids and labor shortages could also materialize
costs across major geographies.

Increasingly congested grids could mean that T&D 
investments need to grow by around three times 
by 2050 to recover from underinvestment and to 
accommodate for intermittent RES. This will likely 
result in an increase in the share of grid cost in total 
average delivered power costs to customers.

As costs increase, grids could become congested 
and labor shortages emerge. Demand management 
(for example, DSR) could help alleviate increases 
in delivered power costs. Nevertheless, as the 
grid decarbonizes with an increased share of 
renewables, the average generation cost per MWh 
is projected to decline, which could bring down the 
system cost of electricity in some cases.

36          Global Energy Perspective 2024

To enable the energy transition, low-carbon 
technologies will need to scale up rapidly. These 
technologies typically require more, and different, 
materials compared to conventional technologies. 
For instance, solar PV requires 137 tons17 of minerals 
and metals per megawatt (MW) of power generated 
(a material intensity of 1.4 times compared to coal and 
gas18), while offshore wind has a material intensity of 
614 tons per MW, 6.3 times higher than coal and gas. 

The business cases for extracting and processing 
these crucial materials will need to be viable and 
environmentally sustainable to enable low-carbon 
technologies to be deployed at scale. However, this 
can be challenging, particularly in a context where 
the development timelines of a project may be longer 
than ten years, requiring investors to look far ahead 
in a time of significant demand shift.

As such, a major challenge for known assets is the 
uncertainty surrounding long-term demand profiles. 
This can be driven by the rapid development of 
downstream technology. For example, the shift 
from nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) to lithium iron 
phosphate (LFC) batteries would greatly reduce 
the demand for nickel and fundamentally impact 
the economics of the industry, creating increased 
hesitation among investors and uncertainty around 
the business cases for new mining and refining 
assets. Other drivers of demand uncertainty include 
geopolitical uncertainties and political instability in 
key geographies.

In Europe, up to 40 percent of the anticipated 460 TWh 
increase in electricity demand from 2023 to 2030 may not 
materialize
Reduced industrial output, delayed electrification in industry, and stalling EV sales could lower expected demand growth

Despite the projected growth in electricity demand, it remains uncertain whether this demand will fully materialize, particularly in 
Europe. Drivers include a slowdown in heat pump installations, slower-than-expected EV sales, lack of investment into industrial 
electrification, and uncertainties in project development. The expected reduction in industrial output in some sectors, such as iron 
and steel, paper and pulp, and chemicals is another contributing factor.

By demand source, heat pump growth might not 
materialize at the expected pace, which would 
translate to zero or negative growth in demand 
for electricity, as the projected improvement 
in insulation, appliances, and lighting would 
counterbalance the increase in demand from a 
reduced number of heat pumps.

Lower-than-expected EV sales, as evidenced by the 
slowdown in sales in 2023, might reduce circulating 
stock and related power demand, partly driven by 
uncertainty around the expected ICE ban in 2035. 

Low investments in the electrification of existing 
assets, as well as a decrease in production and an 
increase in offshoring due to the high cost of capital 
and power prices, could further reduce electricity 
demand.

Uncertainty in green hydrogen project 
development, as well as the low proportion of 
projects that have reached FID, could cause delays 
in investment approvals and slow down project 
deployments.

Nevertheless, while factors such as the gen-AI-
related boom in data centers could drive demand, 
EU regulation might limit this growth to control the 
impact on the grid.

Despite continued reductions in the LCOE, the 
deployment of low-carbon power generation faces 
challenges related to broader market design and 
infrastructure.

Notwithstanding numerous announcements 
spurred by policies such as the US IRA, clean 
commodities production faces a significant shortfall 
in firm commitments. The pace of FID is not on track 
to meet net-zero targets, following concerns over 
feedstock availability and competitive pricing.

The European Union and the United States 
have introduced several policies, which include 
incentives, to promote CCUS. However, the 
deployment of CCUS faces barriers including lack 
of market readiness and logistical issues. Moreover, 
CCUS is as yet unproven at scale for post-
combustion plants. 

EV adoption and heat pump initiatives are 
progressing in both regions but are hindered by high 
costs and supply chain dependencies.
