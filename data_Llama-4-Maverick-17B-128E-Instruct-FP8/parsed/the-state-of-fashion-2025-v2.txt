The State of Fashion 2025 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Challenges at Every Turn

Though hard to predict even in the best of times, 
the fashion industry is in for a particularly 
tumultuous and uncertain 2025. A long-feared 
cyclical slowdown has arrived. Consumers, scarred 
by the recent period of high inﬂation, are 
increasingly price sensitive. There is also the 
surprising rise of dupes, the acceleration of climate 
change and the continued reshuﬄing of global 
trade. Regional diﬀerences, which came into focus 
in 2024, will become even starker in the coming 
year. 

In short, the negative environment predicted by 
many in the fashion industry this time a year ago has 
now manifested. There is still growth to be found, 
but economic uncertainty, geographic disparities as 
well as shifting customer behaviour and preferences 
mean seizing it will require navigating a maze of 
compounding challenges at every turn.

Consequently, 2025 is likely to be a time of 
reckoning for many brands. The upshot is that there 
is still opportunity to be found for brands that move 
nimbly and are quick to adapt to upheavals in a 
chaotic marketplace. 

Sluggish Growth Continues
Judged purely by the topline, the fashion industry’s 

outlook for 2025 appears to be a continuation of the 
sluggishness seen in 2024: revenue growth is 
expected to stabilise in the low single digits. While 
luxury has led in value creation in recent years, the 
McKinsey Global Fashion Index forecasts that in 
2024, it is non-luxury that will drive the entirety of 
the increase in economic proﬁt for the ﬁrst time 
since 2010 (excluding Covid-19). 

Fashion leaders polled in our annual BoF-
McKinsey State of Fashion Executive Survey were 
just as pessimistic as last year. Just 20 percent 
expect improvements in consumer sentiment in 
2025, while 39 percent see industry conditions 
worsening. 

The geographic drivers of revenue and economic 
proﬁt are also undergoing historic shifts. In 
particular, the industry will beneﬁt from falling 
inﬂation and increased tourism in Europe, the 
resilience of high-net-worth individuals in the US 
and new growth engines in Asia to counteract 
uncertainty around consumer spending in China,
which is still recovering from the pandemic.
China will remain the region’s centre of gravity, but 
as the country is buﬀeted by macroeconomic 
headwinds, brands will pivot focus to other Asian 
markets, most notably Japan, Korea and India.

6

The State of Fashion 2025 Acting on Opportunities
To reach these consumers, executives told us they 
will localise their go-to-market models, broaden 
their price ranges and focus on brand positioning to 
capture the attention of shoppers who are 
increasingly prioritising value. This impulse is also 
driving expansion of the resale and off-price 
segments. Brands that do not wish to play in these 
categories must demonstrate to customers why 
their products are worth the premium price. 

One way to achieve this is by improving the 
shopping experience. Consumers are returning to 
in-store shopping at pre-pandemic levels across 
much of the world, but retailers need to remind 
shoppers what they love about the in-store 
experience. That starts with well-trained staff who 
are empowered to assist and inspire customers. 

In the shift back to physical retail, pure-play luxury 
marketplaces have struggled. This coming year may 
see mass online marketplaces experience similar 
disruption; most have seen their share prices 
plummet from pandemic highs and have struggled 
to find an answer to falling demand and rising 
customer acquisition costs. 

Smart e-commerce players are focusing on new 
paths for product discovery. Shoppers who were 
once dazzled by the seemingly endless selection 
available at many online retailers now bemoan 
the difficulty of finding what they want. AI-powered 
curation, content and search can help customers 
discover brands and products more effectively —
and feel more inclined to make a purchase. 

Brands are also reevaluating which consumer 
cohorts to pursue. While the fashion industry has 
historically prioritised younger shoppers, the “Silver 
Generation” of over-50 customers is growing as a 
proportion of the overall population — and fashion 
spending. In 2025, brands will benefit from 
courting these oft-overlooked customers.

“The old playbook 
is now obsolete; the 
industry will need 
a new formula.” 

Not all brands are equally adept at making these 
pivots. Often, it is newer, “challenger” brands, 
unburdened by historic conceptions about products, 
stores and customers, that are coming out on top. 
This is especially true in the sportswear category, 
where incumbents are competing with a wave of 
smaller, but more innovative players that are 
rapidly capturing market share. 

Next year, ongoing shifts in global trade must also 
be monitored and anticipated for their impact on 
sourcing. Retailers will accelerate their 
reconfiguration of supply chains to prioritise 
nearshoring and manufacturing in geopolitically 
aligned countries. 

These supply chains will need to become more agile, 
with companies making efforts to reduce excess 
inventory and minimise the risk of shortfalls. 
Margin pressures, as well as pressures from 
governments around the world to reduce emissions 
and fashion waste, will drive advances in inventory 
management. New technology will aid these efforts. 

Finally, the climate crisis will remain a potent force 
across fashion supply chains and in driving 
consumer behaviour. Even though shoppers have 

proven less willing than hoped to pay extra for 
planet-friendly products, making the business case 
for sustainability less obvious to executives among 
other competing priorities, the mounting cost of 
climate change, and government action to combat 
it, mean sustainability must remain at the top of the 
agenda. Those who choose to approach 
sustainability with a long-term mindset even while 
battling short-term problems will be rewarded with 
more efficient business operations and a 
competitive advantage. 

Leaders who move quickly to identify the bright 
spots, whether they are geographic, demographic or 
technological, will be primed for success, but only if 
they’re able to evolve. The old playbook is now 
obsolete; the industry will need a new formula 
for differentiation and growth.

Industry OutlookThe State of Fashion 2025 Uncertainty persists as executives enter 2025 
with less optimism for the year ahead

For yet another year, the most common sentiment 
among fashion leaders for 2025 was “uncertainty,” 
according to the BoF-McKinsey State of Fashion 
2025 Executive Survey. Just 20 percent of 
respondents expect conditions to improve from 
2024, 41 percent expect conditions to remain the 
same and 39 percent expect them to worsen.1

Like last year, there is a divide among executive 
expectations, but reasons for concern have changed:

• Fashion leaders are concerned about consumer 
sentiment, as the economic outlook remains in 
ﬂux and sluggish across markets. Seven out of 
10 fashion leaders cited consumer conﬁdence 
as the top risk for 2025.1

• Executives remain concerned about how 

geopolitical instability and economic volatility 
will impact the fashion landscape in the year 
ahead.1 Given changing dynamics and conﬂicts 
in the geopolitical landscape we expect these 
risks to stay top of mind. 

• Meanwhile, inﬂation has been falling further 
down the list of executives’ concerns. Around 
the world, central banks are lowering interest 
rates as inﬂation cools. In this year’s survey, 
executives were nearly half as likely to cite 
inﬂation as a key risk compared last year.1 2 3 4

Industry OutlookThe State of Fashion 2025 Fashion industry growth is expected to remain 
low, but increase slightly from 2024

Despite these continued challenges, McKinsey 
Fashion Growth Forecasts predicts the global 
fashion market to post low single-digit growth in 
2025, reflecting a structural deceleration following 
the post-pandemic boom.5 This deceleration, 
coupled with relatively muted consumer 
confidence, will force brands to prioritise capturing 
market share, rather than reaping the rewards of 
the outsized market growth of the last few years.

• Domestic luxury demand is expected to be low, aﬀected by 

consumer caution in Europe. 

•

Economic uncertainty and geopolitical concerns are keeping 
personal savings rates high, reaching a three-year peak in June 2024.7

• Appetite to spend is ticking up slightly as disposable personal 

incomes rise8 9 and inflation falls.10

•

Recovery across the continent will be mixed; sluggish growth is still 
expected in key economies such as Germany and the UK.6

• As of May 2024, tax-free shopping in continental Europe had 

recovered to 138 percent of pre-pandemic sales levels – although 
Chinese tourist spend was 59 percent of 2019 levels.14 

•

Looking ahead, foreign arrivals to Europe are expected to grow by 
8 percent per year from 2024 to 2026, expected to drive market 
growth.15

+3-5%

• GDP growth is expected to slow slightly to 2.2 percent in 20256, while 

the Federal Reserve aims to continue rate cuts in 2025 to boost 
consumption.11

• Aspirational middle- and upper-class consumers’ ability to spend 
on luxury is increasing as a result of decreasing inflation, higher 
disposable income and a strong real estate market.12

• Consumer purchasing power is rising, buoyed by a strong stock 
market and property sector. In 2024, wage growth outpaced 
inflation, while the personal savings rate dipped below pre-pandemic 
levels at 6 percent.8 12

•

The growing ultra-high-net-worth individual (UHNWI) population is

•

In August 2024, consumer confidence fell to just above 2022 record 
lows.9 It remains uncertain whether government measures will be 
sufficient to drive a meaningful boost in sentiment in 2025.

• Domestic luxury growth is expected to pick up slightly in late 2025 
thanks to high savings rates (household savings rate at 32 percent), 
and the rise of new wealth centres, such as Shenzhen and Wuhan.18

• Domestic growth will remain below historical levels due to a 
rebound in international travel and slower growth in UHNWIs 
(expected 8 percent CAGR from 2023 to 2028 vs 13 percent from 
2019 to 2023).16 17

Executives are continuing to focus on sales 
growth in the year ahead. Nearly three out of 
four fashion leaders are prioritising sales growth 
over cost improvements, a slight uptick from the 
2024 survey.1 2

However, the drivers of growth are shifting. In the 
last few years, volume growth has slowed, or even 
declined in regions such as the US and Asia-
Paciﬁc.5 Now, in a reversal of recent years, leaders 
anticipate volumes, rather than price, will fuel 
growth. 

• Compared to the prior year, the number of 
executives that expect to increase prices 
dropped 17 percentage points (%points).

• Nearly two thirds of executives expect volume

growth in 2025, mostly in the low single digits.1 2

16

• Consumers are tired of price increases. This is 
particularly true for middle- or lower-income 
shoppers, who are more sensitive to price 
hikes.19 As a result, brands anticipate having less 
pricing power, in line with executives’ 
uncertainty over consumer appetite to spend.

Industry OutlookThe State of Fashion 2025 To capture market share, fashion executives 
are focusing on diﬀerentiation

In pursuit of diﬀerentiation: At the top of executives’ priorities this year is 
ﬁnding ways to diﬀerentiate, whether through new designs, customer 
experiences or ﬁnding new customer niches.1

Question: What do you think will be the single biggest 
opportunity for the fashion industry in [year]?

Localisation is one lever fashion brands are leveraging. Half of executives plan 
to localise their go-to-market model and value proposition, especially through 
pricing, fulﬁlment channels and assortment. This will help connect with 
customers in promising emerging markets for growth such as India.1

65 percent of executives also plan to alter their assortments to include a variety 
of options across price points.1 In 2025, it will be important to appeal to a wide 
range of consumers to gain share while balancing tight control of inventory.

Trade Reconfigured 

Global trade is shifting as 
major economies diversify 
and source from countries 
where they have more political 
alignment. This will accelerate 
in the fashion industry in 
2025 due to rising costs, 
evolving trade policies and 
sustainability targets. As  
a result, fashion brands are 
likely to double down on 
diversifying their sourcing 
footprint in Asia and lay the 
foundations for nearshoring.

Asia’s New  
Growth Engines 
China’s economic deceleration, 
changing consumer 
preferences and the return 
of international travel 
are making growth in the 
country highly challenging, 
leading international fashion 
brands to look to other Asian 
markets. India will be a focus, 
particularly for high-street 
players, while Japan’s luxury 
boom is expected to continue 
into 2025, fuelled by strong 
international and domestic 
spend. 

Discovery Reinvented 

Silver Spenders 

Value Shift 

Fashion shoppers are 
overwhelmed with choice, 
which negatively impacts their 
engagement and conversion 
rates with brands. However,  
a new era of brand and product 
discovery is on the horizon, 
underpinned by AI-powered 
curation across content  
and search.

Fashion brands have typically 
focused on youth, but in 2025 
they may struggle to grow 
sales from younger shoppers 
alone. The “Silver Generation” 
aged over 50 represents a 
growing population with a high 
share of global spend. Brands 
that engage these previously 
overlooked shoppers while 
creating inter-generational 
appeal will unlock incremental 
growth.

Macroeconomic pressures 
and rising prices have driven 
fashion shoppers to adopt cost-
conscious behaviours. This is 
expected to persist, even as 
some economies begin showing 
signs of recovery. This dynamic 
is fuelling growth in segments 
with strong value-for-money 
perception, such as resale, off-
price and dupes, among others. 
To capture customers’ share 
of wallet, brands will need to 
prove their value.

The Human  
Side of Sales 
Differentiating the in-store 
experience is key to reigniting 
demand for in-person 
shopping. Brands can achieve 
that by empowering their store 
associates to reach their full 
potential, as sales staff have 
a central and valuable role 
to play in connecting with 
customers. The benefits will 
be sizeable, since customer 
and employee experience are 
inextricably linked.

Marketplaces Disrupted 

Following a tumultuous 
period for luxury e-commerce 
platforms, online non-luxury 
marketplaces are facing 
challenges of their own. Share 
prices have dropped as much 
as 98 percent since Covid-19 
peaks due to existential 
business model challenges 
and disruptions. Non-luxury 
marketplaces globally must 
carve out a clear role in the 
fashion ecosystem to survive.

Sportswear 
Showdown 
Challenger brands are 
forecast to generate over half 
of the sportswear segment’s 
economic profit in 2024, up 
from 20 percent in 2020. This 
means the battle between 
challengers and incumbents 
in the growing sportswear 
market will likely intensify. To 
gain market share, brands will 
need to develop innovative 
products and use the right 
ambassadors and channels to 
activate unique brand stories.

Inventory Excellence 

Inventory remains a challenge 
for the industry with both 
excess stock and stocks-
outs impacting brands. In 
2025, margin pressures and 
sustainability regulation will 
place greater emphasis on end-
to-end planning excellence, 
with brands increasingly 
adopting tech tools and 
adjusting their operating model 
to support agile supply chains.

The Sustainability 
Collective 
Fragmentation and 
complexity across the fashion 
value chain, coupled with 
consumer reluctance to pay 
for sustainable products, are 
inherent barriers to reaching 
sustainability goals. But 
with decarbonisation efforts 
falling short of targets and the 
climate crisis accelerating, 
inaction is not an option. 
The fashion sector must act 
collectively to drive impact.

01. Trade Reconﬁgured Global trade is shifting as major economies diversify 
and source from countries where they have more political alignment. This 
will accelerate in the fashion industry in 2025 due to rising costs, evolving 
trade policies and sustainability targets. As a result, fashion brands are likely 
to double down on diversifying their sourcing footprint in Asia and lay the 
foundations for nearshoring.

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

• Trade barriers and supply disruptions have increased 5x 

since 2015, with around 3,000 trade restrictions imposed 
in 2023.

• US apparel and textile imports are diversifying away from 
China at the fastest rate since 2010, down 6 percentage 
points (%points) in 2023 vs 2019.

• The share of apparel manufacturing foreign direct 
investment into nearshoring regions has increased 
20%points in the last five years for the US and 8%points 
for the EU.

• Regularly assess the sourcing footprint, leveraging 

analytics and detailed supplier data to identify priority 
regions for reconfiguration. Consider both net margin 
and cash benefits of nearshoring or diversification.

• Collaborate closely with suppliers by establishing 

strategic relationships, prioritising data transparency 
and co-investments to jointly build resilient and 
productive supply chains.

• Partner with industry stakeholders, such as regulators 

and manufacturers, engaging in collaborative planning 
and setting aligned targets to tackle sustainability 
goals at scale.

01. Trade Reconfigured Global EconomyThe State of Fashion 2025 Global economies are diversifying sourcing and 
reducing the geopolitical distance of trade ﬂows

Up until the early 2020s, global trade revolved 
around the relationship between the US and China. 
In recent years, geopolitical tensions and market 
shifts, coupled with a change in sourcing economics, 
have caused a shift in this dynamic, resulting in a 
“multi-polar” structure where more countries 
participate in global trade. 

This push to diversify trade ﬂows is happening 
across industries. Between 2017 and 2023, the 
share of total US imports from China fell by 5.8 
percentage points, with imports in strategic 
industries such as electronics reducing by more 
than 20 percent in 2023.1 In the same year, the EU 
cut the overall trade deﬁcit with China by 27 
percent to diversify supply chains in strategic 
industries such as electronics and chemicals.2 

In parallel, other major economies are also reducing 
risk by trading with more geopolitically aligned 
countries. These economies, predominantly China, 
Germany, the UK and the US, have reduced the 
geopolitical distance of their trade by 4 to 10 
percent in the last ﬁve years.3

Establishing resilience 
Players are increasingly diversifying their sourcing 
footprint to create supply chain resilience. The 
share of apparel and textiles coming from China 
decreased by 6 percentage points (%points) 
between 2019 and 2023 for the US and 3%points 
for the EU. The total value of imports from China 
declined by 5 percent on average per year during 
this period, compared to a less than 1 percent 
average yearly decline in the previous decade for 
the US.4 Similarly, for the EU, the total value of 
imports declined by 2 percent on average per year, 
compared to a 1 percent average yearly decline in 
the previous decade.4

Diversiﬁcation in Asia 
Markets such as India, Vietnam and Bangladesh are 
expected to become key sourcing hubs for US and 
European apparel and textiles. Meanwhile, China is 
progressively losing cost-competitiveness due to 
rising labour costs, which increased by 38 percent 
from 2010 to 2021.5 

Nearshoring
Nearshoring is expected to become an increasingly 
relevant sourcing strategy, with US and EU apparel 
and textile imports from nearshoring destinations 
expected to increase 2%points and 3%points 
respectively by 2030.4

The economic and geographic advantages of 
sourcing regions are shifting, with several emerging 
markets becoming more cost-competitive due to 
several factors.

Mentions of “tariﬀs” and “trade policies” across 
apparel company reports and investor 
presentations have increased by more than 50 
percent since 2020.10 

Increasing labour costs in China are compromising 
manufacturer cost-competitiveness compared to 
other Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam, 
where average hourly labour costs are less than half 
of those in China.7

Shipping costs have drastically increased across 
Asia-to-US shipping routes. There was a 165 
percent increase in Asia-to-US east coast route 
container rates on Feb. 05, 2024, compared to two 
months prior.6 Meanwhile, shipping prices across 
trade routes in the Middle East have increased 5x 
from December 2023 to February 2024.8 

As of May 2023, the EU is planning to impose 
import duties on goods under €150 ($164) from 
China, impacting an estimated 2.3 billion items per 
year.11 

Southeast Asian countries are also restricting 
Chinese imports, with tariﬀs of up to 200 percent 
on imported textiles.12 

The US is considering excluding Chinese imports 
from its de minimis import rule, where goods valued 
at less than $800 are duty free.13

Changes in country of production alone can heavily 
inﬂuence greenhouse gas emissions. There is wide 
emissions variance between suppliers, given more 
than 70 percent of fashion industry emissions come 
from upstream activities, primarily textile 
production.14

For example, Pakistan has half the emissions factor 
in fabric production than China, due to a lower 
share of coal-based energy production.15

As a result, some fashion companies have started to 
invest in the decarbonisation of their footprint, such 
as H&M’s investment in Bangladesh Wind Power 
in 2024.16

20

01. Trade Reconfigured Global EconomyThe State of Fashion 2025 Fashion brands will look to Asia growth markets 
such as India for manufacturing

Fashion brands initially turned to Vietnam to 
reduce their dependency on China, with the value of 
apparel and textile exports from Vietnam 
increasing 35 percent between 2015 and 2020.4
Now, other Asian countries such as India and 
Bangladesh are also hotspots. In the US, apparel 
and textile imports from these countries increased 
3 percentage points (%points) and 2%points 
respectively between 2020 and 2023.4 This trend is 
expected to continue as fashion executives rank 
Asia growth markets as their top sourcing hotspots 
for the next five years and regulatory incentives fuel 
manufacturer capability building in these countries.

India is expected to play a more prominent role. 
While challenges in production capabilities have 
impacted scale to date — India had the highest 
percentage of apparel products that failed quality 
standards in 2023 — these pressures may start to 
ease.17 The Indian government has invested around 
$2.5 billion in Production-Linked-Incentives and 
reforms to Quality Control Orders, while foreign 
investment has increased 3x since 2019.18 19 20 

Bangladesh, despite being a favoured sourcing 
location in recent years, has experienced increased 
political and climate disruptions, leading to brands 
shifting up to 40 percent of orders in the second 
half of 2024 to other markets in the region.21

01. Trade Reconfigured Global EconomyThe State of Fashion 2025 Renewed interest in nearshoring is leading to
increased capacity and improved capabilities

While mentions of nearshoring in corporate presentations increased 20-fold 
between 2018 and 2022,3 the share of imports to Europe and the US from 
nearshoring countries has remained ﬂat since 2019.4 This is due to the limited 
manufacturing capacity and capabilities of local suppliers, with lower labour 
productivity meaning total landed cost remains higher than other regions —
despite competitive labour rates, lower shipping costs and tariﬀ advantages. 
However, these challenges are likely to be addressed going forward. 

Capacity and capability building 

•

Investments: The share of apparel foreign direct investment into 
nearshoring manufacturing has increased by 20 percentage points 
(%points) for the US and 8%points for Europe in the last ﬁve years.20

• Government incentives: The Americas Act — a bipartisan bill in the US —
if enacted would dedicate $14 billion to apparel subsidies and investments 
in nearshoring.22 The EU Strategy for Sustainable Textiles laid out several 
initiatives to reduce environmental impact in 2023, which may be 
addressed through nearshoring. 

Cost-competitiveness

• Productivity: Local manufacturers and Asian companies with facilities in 

Central America are investing in vertical integration of textile 
manufacturing and fabric supply to improve productivity, while China’s 
shifting workforce demographics are causing its productivity advantage to 
slowly decline. 

• Speed to market: As the pace of trend cycles accelerates, nearshoring 

could beneﬁt company bottom lines by potentially leading to 3-5x faster 
lead times, higher net margins and lower inventory levels.23 24

LATIN AMERICA

65 percent of US fashion companies 
say they increased sourcing from 
USMCA members in 2023, especially 
Mexico — up from 40 percent in 2020 
— owing to advantageous trade 
agreements for textiles and apparel25 
and increased US investments.20

Mexico-US shipping routes have cost 
and speed advantages compared to 
China, costing around $5,000 for a 
single container vs $18,000 and 
taking 5-10 days vs 60 days in China, 
the latter of which has doubled due to 
supply chain disruptions.24

The value of apparel and textile 
exports from Guatemala to the US has 
increased 10 percent from 2020 to 
2023.4 While manufacturing in the 
country costs around 5 to 10 percent 
more than in Vietnam, shipping times

from 150 to 170 days in Asia-Pacific 
to under 50 days in Turkey, with an 
average of 7 days in transit.23 

01. Trade Reconfigured Global EconomyThe State of Fashion 2025 Flexible supply chains and close supplier 
relationships will be critical to success

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

Regularly assess and optimise
sourcing footprint

Develop strategic relationships 
with manufacturers and suppliers

Shape trade flows with industry 
stakeholders

Regularly perform footprint assessments to 
identify priority regions for reconfiguration 
based on manufacturing costs and 
capabilities, considering potential supply 
chain disruptions that may impact both 
(e.g. conflicts, climate change). 

Leverage analytics to examine cost 
breakdowns, improve unit costs and 
conceive more competitive sourcing 
processes with both existing and new 
vendors. This may require detailed supplier 
information to model costs based on a 
range of inputs and trade agreements. 

Assess cost competitiveness on a net 
margin basis when making sourcing 
decisions, taking into account not just 
input costs but final margin and cash 
benefits from faster speed-to-market and 
increased supply chain flexibility.

Develop an understanding of supply chain 
disruptions across the footprint, actively 
managing and minimising the implications 
on their operations, such as cost and 
speed-to-market.

Rethink the approach to manufacturers and 
suppliers, with an emphasis on developing long-
term strategic partnerships to increase the 
efficiency and resilience of supply chains. 
Historically, fashion brands and suppliers have 
been more cautious in making joint investments 
compared to other industries, given the highly 
competitive nature of the apparel market. 
However, the increased disruption and volatility 
in brands’ sourcing footprints requires more 
effective and closer collaboration to ensure 
efficient operations.

Adopt digital solutions to enable efficiency and 
collaboration. To unlock the full value of these 
tools, fashion brands and manufacturers will 
need to not only embrace digital tools across 
their value chain, but also prioritise process 
redesign, data quality enhancement and the 
integration of planning systems to provide 
visibility for all parties across the value chain.

Proactively shape the future of apparel and 
textile trade flows by engaging manufacturers, 
regulators and sustainability bodies to align on 
industry targets and co-invest in 
decarbonisation projects at scale.

Work closely with manufacturers and upstream 
suppliers to achieve sustainability goals and 
reduce apparel emissions. This remains a 
competitive imperative for suppliers and fashion 
brands are unable tackle these issues alone. 

Adopt a collaborative planning process to align 
on short- and long-term business objectives, 
mutual targets and strategic plans, which can 
formalise industry affiliations and arrangements. 
Multiple brands, suppliers and regulators can 
also partner to launch large-scale sourcing 
excellence programmes.

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

•

Increase localisation of the go-to-market model to 
resonate with local consumer preferences and cultural 
norms, catering to nuances in each Asian market.

• Build regional omnichannel capabilities in both owned 
and third-party channels to meet the growing demands 
of shoppers and their rising purchasing power.

• Fashion executives are increasingly positive about Asian 
growth prospects outside of China, especially in India 
and mature APAC markets (e.g. Japan and Korea), for 
which executives show 54 percentage point positive

India’s strong growth is rendering it a key global fashion 
market, particularly in the mid-market segment, which 
is expected to grow around 12 to 17 percent in 2025 
compared to the projected low single-digit growth of 
the global fashion market.

Japan’s luxury market grew 25 to 30 percent in the first 
half of 2024, driven by ongoing currency weakness and 
a surge in tourism. Tourism spend is expected to grow 
from $36 billion in 2023 to nearly $100 billion in 2030.

After years of impressive growth, China’s economy 
is now worth $18 trillion1 and its apparel market is 
the second largest in the world.2 In 2025, the IMF 
projects China’s economy will grow by 4.5 percent, 
outpacing global GDP growth of around 3 percent.3

While still higher than global GDP growth, China’s 
projected growth rate reﬂects a deceleration from 
the previous decade, which averaged around 7 
percent growth per year from 2013 to 2019. The 
economic slowdown is expected to continue in the 
medium term, with the IMF forecasting GDP 
growth to fall to 3.3 percent by 2029, due to aging 
consumers and slower productivity growth.3

The slowdown is aﬀecting retail sales. Apparel sales 
increased only 1.3 percent in the ﬁrst half of 2024 
compared to the same period a year prior. This 
growth is about half that of 2019 levels (around 3

In the non-luxury segment, domestic brands have been taking share

• Domestic brands grew their share versus international brands by 6 

percentage points (%points) between 2013 and 2023.6 As of 2023, over 50 
percent of Chinese consumers preferred domestic brands, a 35%point 
increase from 2011.7

• Even market leaders such as Uniqlo have recently cited challenges in China, 
such as lower consumer appetite and a need for more localised products.8

• Foreign sports and outdoor brands continue to thrive while focusing on 
localisation and a strong association with quality. Lululemon and Amer 
Sports, owner of Arc’teryx, saw double-digit growth in China in the ﬁrst 
quarter of 2024.9 10 11

In the luxury segment, consumer shifts are driving a slowdown 

• Despite brands such as Prada Group and Hermès posting double-digit 

growth in Asia (excl. Japan) in the ﬁrst half of 2024, China luxury growth 
slowed to an estimated negative 3 percent from 12 percent in 2023.6 12 13

• China’s recent consumer and government condemnation of wealth 

ﬂaunting, or “luxury shame,” is driving demand for “quieter” and more 
aﬀordable products, such small leather goods, while brands such as Ralph 
Lauren have a bullish outlook.14 15 16

• Government stimulus measures are expected to support luxury demand, 

but this may not translate to domestic sales. Chinese luxury spend abroad is 
projected to increase 12 to 17%points from 2023 to 2025,17 though as of 
May 2024, spending by Chinese shoppers was still below 2019 levels in key 
luxury markets.18

02. Asia’s New Growth EnginesGlobal EconomyThe State of Fashion 2025 India is poised to become a key fashion market due 
to a strong mid-market and potential in luxury

India is expected to become the fourth largest economy in 2025, growing at 7 
percent year on year, outpacing all other economies.21 22 This puts India on track 
to become the world’s third-largest consumer market by 2027.23

Non-luxury

• There are 430 million people in India’s middle class — greater than the 

middle classes of the US and Western Europe combined. It is expected to 
reach 1 billion by 2050, largely from tier-two and -three cities.25

Indian fashion customers are increasingly trend-focused. Digitisation is 
accelerating this shift, as is the large share of young consumers in the 
country. People under the age of 35 make up 66 percent of India’s 
population, amounting to over 808 million people.26

Infrastructure challenges
High-quality retail real estate remains limited, especially in tier-two and tier-
three cities, impacting physical expansion, especially for luxury brands. Last-
mile delivery also remains difficult, requiring international companies to make 
significant investments to offer seamless customer experiences. 

Partner selection and operating model
While brands such as Uniqlo have found success entering India on their own, 
finding the right local partner continues to be instrumental for international 
brands operating in India. A local partner can define the right operating model 
and go-to-market strategy, accounting for complex regional nuances. 

Local consumer dynamics
Indian culture heavily influences fashion and can vary widely by region. Indian 
shoppers tend to spend more on jewellery (44 vs 13 percent global average) and 
less on apparel (40 vs 52 percent).6 Local brands with expertise in traditional 
wear tend to dominate in apparel, increasingly so with the rise of local fast-
fashion players. In 2023, nine of the top 20 apparel brands were domestic.6
That said, increasing openness to Western silhouettes is making markets such 
as the sizeable wedding industry attractive to international brands.35

Regulatory requirements
Regulatory requirements, such as local sourcing rules, plus high regional taxes, 
continue to act as barriers in the market. However, some new policy changes for 
foreign brands allow 100 percent foreign direct investment in single-brand 
retail and selling via e-commerce prior to having physical locations.36

02. Asia’s New Growth EnginesGlobal EconomyThe State of Fashion 2025 The yen’s weakness made Japan a major 
international shopping destination in 2024 

Japan’s luxury fashion market, estimated at $20-25 
billion at the end of 2023, was up 25 to 30 percent 
year on year at constant exchange rates for the ﬁrst 
half of 2024.24 Players including LVMH, 
Richemont and Hermès saw double-digit sales 
growth in the country, surpassing pre-pandemic 
levels.12 37 38 Even fashion brands that saw overall 
sales decline during the second quarter of 2024, 
such as Kering (-11 percent) and Ferragamo (-13 
percent), delivered healthy topline growth in Japan 
of around 27 percent and 10 percent, respectively.39

A core driver of this strength is the yen’s 
depreciation, with the currency hitting a 38-year 
low against the dollar in July 2024.40 This attracted 
luxury shoppers from around the world, fuelling 
record-high duty-free sales in department stores.41

Unlike other markets, Japan’s tourism has made a 
complete recovery from the pandemic. The country 
had 17.7 million visitors in the ﬁrst half of 2024, a 
66 percent increase from 2023 and 7 percent from 
2019,42  with 25 percent from South Korea, 17 
percent from China, 17 percent from Taiwan and 8 
percent from the US.43

02. Asia’s New Growth EnginesGlobal EconomyThe State of Fashion 2025 International and domestic luxury spend continue 
to propel the market in Japan

The Japanese luxury market is expected to grow 
between 8 and 12 percent in 2025, maintaining its 
position as a top luxury shopping destination in the 
years to come.24 Brands such as Hermès are 
opening more stores in Japan after seeing double-
digit growth, while emerging brands including 
Gemmyo, Ganni and Studio Nicholson opened their 
ﬁrst stores in the country in the last year.44

In the near term, positive price dynamics will 
continue to fuel inbound tourism, though this trend 
will rely on the trajectory of the yen and the Bank of 
Japan’s monetary policy. The Japan Tourism 
Agency expects annual tourism spend to reach 
around $100 billion by 2030,45 far surpassing 
2023’s record of $36 billion.46 

Domestic demand is also robust, with Japanese 
customers making up a signiﬁcant portion of luxury 
sales.47 The country remains one of the world's 
largest economies and is home to the second-
largest number of UHNWIs in Asia, a group 
expected to grow by more than 12 percent from 
2023 to 2028.29

02. Asia’s New Growth EnginesGlobal EconomyThe State of Fashion 2025 A go-to-market fashion strategy that accounts 
for local nuances is crucial to success in Asia

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

Curate a localised go-to-market approach that 
resonates with customers and culture 

Develop strong omnichannel propositions, 
leveraging both owned and third-party channels

Tailor international brand product portfolios and supply chains to better 
serve local markets, as fashion tastes and trend dynamics significantly 
diﬀer between Asian and Western markets (and within Asian countries 
themselves):

• Cater to local consumer preferences by creating special collections, 
altering product dimensions and adjusting pricing architecture. 
However, brands will need to ensure that styles do not diverge too 
far from their international oﬀerings, otherwise they risk diluting 
global brand image.

•

Evaluate opportunities to localise elements of the supply chain to 
increase agility and speed-to-market to compete with local players. 
This will be particularly relevant in India, where local brands have 
strong market share. High apparel import taxes and difficulties in 
last-mile delivery can also be challenging for international brands 
without strong local capabilities.

• Adapt marketing messaging and partner with local influencers to 

reach consumers in relevant channels. To achieve the right balance 
between global and local elements, companies should consider 
building local teams in focus markets, particularly in branding, 
marketing and communications functions where strategies can vary 
considerably by region.

Invest in developing integrated in-store and online propositions, adjusting 
for nuances in Asian markets:

•

•

•

In China, consider direct-to-consumer and owned online propositions. 
Owned online channels have gained significant traction since 2020 
due to declining offline traffic and rising customer acquisition costs in 
e-commerce marketplaces. Additionally, Chinese consumers value 
shopping direct-to-consumer for the personalisation it can oﬀer — 69 
percent of Chinese consumers value personalisation, according to a 
McKinsey survey.48

In India, partner with local online marketplaces. Limited real estate 
availability and last-mile logistics, especially in tier-two and -three 
cities, make partnering with local online marketplaces key to reaching 
consumers. E-commerce retailers like Flipkart-owned Myntra have 
become a key partner to international brands in India. H&M, for 
example, sells on the platform in India, while in all other markets it only 
sells through owned channels.

In Japan, oﬀer hyper-personalised retail services where appropriate. 
This approach is key to enticing local customers, particularly in luxury, 
where concierge-style strategies known as gaishotarget VIP shoppers. 
Department store groups such as Daimaru Matsuzakaya report gaisho
sales increased 7 percent in the first half of 2023 to account for nearly 
one third of all sales.49

Myntra: An Online Gateway 
t
to India’s Fashion Market

Myntra’s CEO Nandita Sinha is helping brands reach 
millions of India’s young, aspirational and trend-conscious 
consumers with rising income levels. The mid-market 
fashion e-tailer is doubling down on creating influencer-led 
content, scaling its premium offerings and encouraging 
s. 
global brands to leverage the country’s sourcing capabilities. 

BY ARNIKA THAKUR

Brands are pulling out all the stops to capture 
millions of hyper-connected and trend-conscious 
Millennial and Gen-Z customers in India, a cohort 
that offers fashion companies an opportunity to 
explore newer growth markets in Asia. In the centre 
of it is fashion e-commerce giant Myntra. The 
mass-market and premium platform is an 
increasingly important online retail channel for 
global brands such as H&M, Mango and Ralph 
Lauren, as well as local players such as Masaba and 
Rohit Bal. Based in Bengaluru, the “Silicon Valley of 
India,” the company uses artificial intelligence and 
other technologies to offer styling services and 

product recommendations. “[Indian] Gen-Zs are 
very, very conscious of global trends and they want 
to adopt [them] really fast,” says Nandita Sinha, 
who became Myntra’s chief executive in 2022 after 
more than eight years at parent Flipkart Group, a 
company owned by Walmart. By harnessing data-
backed consumer insights, trialling social 
commerce and securing A-list Bollywood celebrity 
ambassadors, Sinha has helped Myntra attract 
more than 60 million monthly active users. 
E-commerce platforms like Myntra are key to 
driving growth in India because they help brands 
overcome the shortage of suitable physical retail 

infrastructure in the market, she says. “We are just 
starting off. Only 12 percent of fashion in India is 
bought online …There are 75 million Gen-Z 
customers [in India] and we have 16 million of them 
on our platform, so we have a whole way to go.” 
But to win market share, partner brands must not 
assume consumers in India are monolithic, she 
advises. “It’s important to have the right local 
partner to be able to navigate through the many 
Indias that exist.”

What is it about India that makes 
it such an attractive growth engine 
for international fashion brands 
in 2025? 
India continues to defy the odds of the 
global economy’s growth rates. [India 
also has an aspirational] young 
customer base, which is growing, and 
they will continue to grow their 
consumption basket. 

India is a unique country which has 
both sourcing as well as consumption 
capacity. So, this is where the value 
for international brands becomes 
extremely lucrative, where they can 
reach out to this large base of 
customers in a manner that taps into 
the supply potential of the country as 
well. There are three factors [that are 
driving growth for brands]: rising 
incomes, younger customers and 
internet penetration.

Where does Myntra ﬁt into this 
growth picture?
E-commerce is an important vector of 
access for the country. [Myntra] 
continues to be the largest platform 
for international [fashion brands 
with] … almost 60 million consumers 
coming to us every month. Six million 
of them come to us every day.

We [also] oﬀer something called 
Myntra Marketing Services; when 

brands come to India, we help them 
build their brand in the country 
[through] joint marketing activities.

What is the proportion of traditional 
Indian and Indo-Western fusion 
wear sales on Myntra, compared to 
that of western wear, and what does 
this mean for international brands? 
Traditional wear is bigger but 
western wear is fast-growing and it's 
leading in terms of growth in the 
womenswear segment. People are 
celebrating all Indian festivals, 
weddings have become grander, 
which is fuelling the consumption of 
traditional wear as a premium, 
celebratory category. Runway Icons, 
our premium [traditional] wear 
[online destination], grew almost 100 
percent in 2023. But we are seeing 
growth in customers adopting 
western wear. [In terms of 
international brands], Mango did a 
special Diwali collection last year, 
where they used western silhouettes 
with elements of celebration … That’s 
where we are seeing this work. 

How does Myntra plan to capitalise 
on the high-end fashion opportunity 
as international luxury brands seek 
to expand their presence in India? 
Premiumisation will continue to grow 
and [there is] growth in consumption 
in the aﬄuent and the upper-aﬄuent 

class. What that means is that luxury 
and bridge-to-luxury brands are going 
to ﬁnd a place in the market. We have 
an app-in-app — Myntra Luxe —
where we partner with diﬀerent 
brands, like The Collective (Aditya 
Birla Group’s multi-brand luxury 
retail chain across in India), which are 
exclusively available on our platform.

“India is a unique 
country which 
has both 
sourcing as well 
as consumption 
capacity.”

Some of the big opportunities in the 
luxury market are in accessories, 
especially the watches category. 
Brands in that category, like Tissot, 
are growing. Luxury fragrances are 
growing at twice the pace of the 
normal market.

What kind of growth rates are other 
fashion segments seeing? Which 
categories are outperforming and 
why?
Footwear and accessories continue to 
grow ahead of the market. Apparel 
has seen a little post-Covid jump in 
consumption as people came back to 
the oﬃce and started travelling again. 
Things have stabilised a little bit, but 
we will see growth in that segment 
next year. The large driving force of 
that growth is going to come from 
Gen-Z customers, who are seeking 
new trends at aﬀordable prices.
Trend-forward merchandise … is 
probably the fastest-growing market 
today in the country and platforms

that build on that are going to be key 
in the next few years. Mass-premium 
and DTC brands are leading the 
growth for apparel. International 
brands continue to grow [faster] than 
the [overall] category, too.

What are some of the fashion 
shopping behaviours that deﬁne 
India’s Gen-Z consumers? 
Gen-Z consumers here are very 
diﬀerent from Millennial shoppers, 
but they are not diﬀerent from their 
international counterparts. Their 
purchase frequency is 30 to 40 
percent more than their Millennial 
counterparts, which is what we see 
globally. Second, they are inspired by 

international trends. 
Gen-Zs are moving away from 
traditional media and looking at 
inﬂuencers and styling. When you 
look at online catalogue images, Gen-
Z’s feedback is [they] want to see the 
full outﬁt [to see how to style the item 
being featured rather than just shots 
of that item]. Catalogues have to 
become inspiring rather than just 
about product images. 

videos. Almost 10 percent of our 
monthly active users are engaging 
with these, and they have higher 
retention and higher spend.

We are using image search very 
eﬀectively for Gen-Z and we’ve also 
started what we call the Glam Clan, 
where we invite Myntra customers, 
who post reviews and photographs on 
our platform, to become inﬂuencers. 

This is what we tapped into as we 
built FWD [Myntra’s immersive 
shopping app-in-app]. We have 
something called Myntra Minis, 
[which features] short, snackable 
content, short styling and product 

How are social commerce, short 
format videos and collaborations 
with micro-inﬂuencers helping you 
reach more young consumers, 
especially in smaller cities?
This year we have doubled down on 

37

[social media and collaborations with 
inﬂuencers]. We will create content 
with almost 40,000 micro-
inﬂuencers as we go forward, which 
will help us reach tier-two, tier-three 
cities, the younger generation, etc. We 
will double down on reaching out to 
Gen-Z customers through FWD. 
Products like cargo pants, for 
example, which are topical and 
trendy, we’d see those blow up 
through FWD. Then we take them to 
our customers through micro-
inﬂuencers. That’s what we will 
continue to build on.

02. Asia’s New Growth EnginesGlobal EconomyThe State of Fashion 2025 “For the size of the country, 
there are limited high-
quality tier-one malls, which 
are expanding but not 
enough [compared to the] 
rate at which consumption 
is increasing.”

What India-speciﬁc challenges and 
opportunities should brands be 
aware of as they enter the market?
Global fashion brands encounter 
challenges like limited retail 
infrastructure, high import duties and 
operational complexities in India.

For the size of the country, there are 
limited high-quality tier-one malls, 
which are expanding but not enough 
[compared to the] rate at which 
consumption is increasing. The 
second is supply: the more localised 
the supply the better it is for value 
delivery to the customer. 

Third, India is many Indias [meaning 
it’s a highly diverse market]. Fourth is 
brand building. There are brands 
which have an international legacy, 
some of that will rub oﬀ on India, but 
you continuously have to build on the 
brand.

Myntra is experimenting with 
AI-led product discovery and 
curation. How is this impacting 
conversion rates? What are some 
of the other technological 
innovations you’ve trialled?
If you look at the two big pillars of 
fashion experience, the ﬁrst is 
inspiration — which is where social 
commerce comes into play. We do it 
through diﬀerent formats, like 

38

inﬂuencer-led content, which is our 
content discovery piece. That has 
been a big success for us. We’ve seen 
almost six million consumers who 
interact with Myntra Minis.

The second piece is assistance. This 
is where things like MyFashionGPT 
(which enables users to discover 
related product options) come 
into play. Our AI-powered styling 
assistant My Stylist helps consumers 
style products they buy. Maya is 
our AI-driven, conversational, real-
time commerce bot assistant. 
We’ve seen almost two million users 
interact with these. This is where 
we see higher conversions, higher 
revenue per user and higher return 
rates of these customers.

There are other core vectors where 
we use AI, like size and ﬁt. That brings 
down our return rates and there’s 
higher conversion [so it] really is a 
very hard-working example of how AI 
is helping business.

The volume of choice is working against fashion 
brands, negatively affecting conversion as shoppers 
increasingly abandon carts.

In response, some retailers have reduced the size of 
their offering to increase relevancy and reduce 
choice paralysis. Asos, for example, announced it 
will offer fewer but more relevant brands to 
customers, reducing stock intake by 30 percent 
year on year in the first quarter of 2024, and is 
planning a further 16 percent reduction in stock by 
the end of 2024.2

Search remains the primary mode of online product 
discovery. 69 percent of customers state they go 
directly to a retailer's search bar when shopping 
online. However, 80 percent are dissatisﬁed with 
the search experience and leave the site as a result. 
41 percent cite irrelevant results as a main barrier 
to shopping.3

Fashion brands are starting to address the 
challenges by using generative AI. While promising, 
these eﬀorts are a work in progress. Revolve has 
reported signiﬁcant increases in customer 
engagement from its experiments with generative 
AI-powered search. Kering, on the other hand, 
introduced Madeline, a ChatGPT-powered

Customer product discovery and search is the top-ranked use case for generative AI in 2025, according 
to fashion executives.5 This is thanks to:

Growing customer demand for AI-powered shopping experiences
79 percent of customers surveyed by Google say they would ﬁnd it helpful for AI to understand their 
speciﬁc needs and recommend products. 82 percent say they want AI to reduce their time spent 
researching what to buy.6 To address this, 84 percent of organisations say hyper-personalised experiences 
across customer touchpoints are a priority for the next 12 months.3

Increased competitiveness in quality and cost 
Intense competition among technology players such as Google, Meta and OpenAI has driven signiﬁcant 
improvements in model quality while decreasing their cost-to-deploy. Google DeepMind’s latest AI model, 
Gemini, will oﬀer AI overviews featuring reﬁned recommendations, multi-step reasoning, planning and 
multi-modal capabilities. In October 2024, the company introduced a new shopping experience centred on 
AI features such as a personalised shopping feed and guides that summarise relevant product information.7 
Meta has also upgraded its open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, with monthly users increasing 10x from 
January to July 2024.8

Greater accuracy of AI tools
Competition has also driven accuracy improvements. For example, OpenAI's GPT-4o is 15 to 20 percent 
more accurate than previous models, generating fewer hallucinations across a range of tasks.9 Similarly, 
start-ups such as Anthropic are entering the space with models such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, demonstrating 
greater accuracy compared to incumbent models.10

Emerging commercial success stories
While experiments have produced mixed results, some brands have started to realise the impact of AI
investments on product discovery and their bottom lines. Zalando credited an 18 percent year-on-year 
increase in proﬁtability in the second quarter of 2024 in part to the roll-out of several generative AI 
features aimed at lowering costs and increasing customer engagement, including a ChatGPT-powered 
shopping assistant, personalised product recommendations and curated content.11

Brands and retailers have recognised the power of 
optimising search to solve for consumers’ 
increasingly contextual and colloquial search terms, 
leveraging natural language prompts to curate a 
shortlist of relevant options.

Daydream leverages generative AI, machine 
learning and computer vision to deliver highly 
personalised search results using natural language 
and image recognition with detailed product 
catalogues. Daydream has raised $50 million in 
seed funding and closed partnerships with brands 
such as Alo Yoga, Jimmy Choo and Dôen, among 
others, with the objective of launching a beta 
version in Autumn 2024.12

Consumers are using multiple modes of search, 
such as image recognition, to identify looks they 
want to shop. The likes of Google and Amazon 
leverage this technology, while new start-ups such 
as Y Combinator-backed Capsule are focusing on 
perfecting these alternative search methods for 
fashion discovery. 

Capsule’s on-demand product discovery platform 
includes a unique product index, based on over 
20,000 scraped data points per day. The app works 
similarly to the music app Shazam, using computer 
vision and deep learning to identify similar styles to 
those uploaded by users.13

Increased appetite among brands and retailers to 
enhance the online customer experience has 
sparked interest in AI partnerships with players 
such as Lily AI, Bloomreach, Vantage Discovery, 
Constructor and others.

Constructor’s B2B platform enables brands and 
retailers to embed AI in product search. Valued at 
$550 million, it has tripled revenues since 2022.14
Constructor partners with brands such as Under 
Armour and Birkenstock to deliver personalised

Brand discovery through social media is now equally as common as through search engines, with 38

social commerce has yet to pick up pace in the US and Europe. 

However, social media’s growing role in discovery may ﬁnally unlock its potential in the West in 2025. The

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

Build AI foundations

Prioritise value and accuracy, then scale

Manage risks and ethics

Embed AI literacy in the hiring criteria for 
adjacent roles, such as in marketing 
functions, in relation to customer experience 
and brand perception. Upskill the existing 
workforce on the appropriate use of AI.

Establish a technology backbone (including 
tech stack and infrastructure) that provides 
flexibility to adopt and scale search and 
discovery use cases. 

Identify relevant tech partners for cost-
eﬀective generative AI deployment or build 
in-house capabilities through acquisition. 
Ensure product data is optimised for AI 
search, identifying relevant product features 
and attributes, for both organic search and 
content-led discovery.

Apply a prioritisation framework to identify the 
discovery and search use cases with the 
highest value based on customer insights. 
Employ a test-and-learn approach, starting with 
use cases that perform specific tasks with 
consistently accurate results before scaling 
more broadly across a larger customer base or 
set of activities. 

Assess on an ongoing basis the trade-offs 
retailers may need to make between showing 
customers the most relevant products to 
improve conversion and monetising search 
results by allowing brands to sponsor listings. 

Implement AI best practice frameworks to guide 
teams through the appropriate use and 
communication of AI in content and search to 
gain customer trust. 

Consistently monitor how AI models are 
developed and trained, incorporating broader 
data sets that consider all customers. Monitor 
search accuracy and model output through 
human validation and A/B testing to ensure 
resonance with customers. Balance changes with 
brand tone of voice, prioritising authenticity and 
avoiding rigid algorithm-driven outputs.

More than half of Gen-Z consumers are worried 
about their ﬁnancial situation in the year ahead.2 In 
response, young shoppers in the US are changing 
their spending habits, including around 40 percent
spending less on clothing.1 In the UK, 70 percent 
of Gen-Z are prioritising aﬀordability when 
buying clothes.3

Gen-Z also uses credit more than other 
generations. In the US, 15 percent of Gen-Z credit 
card users had maxed-out borrowing in the ﬁrst 
quarter of 2024, more than any other generation.4

Young consumers feel overwhelmed by the volume 
of brands they are targeted by. 80 percent of Gen-Z 
shoppers say they feel they are exposed to more 
brands and adverts than any other generation.6

Yet Gen-Z and Millennials remain the prime focus 
for many fashion brands. In 2025, approximately
60 percent of fashion executives plan to double 
down on these consumer groups, which are twice as 
likely to be targeted than older generations; 29 
percent of executives say they plan to target Gen-X 
and 14 percent say they plan to target Baby 
Boomers.7

Gen-Z consumers prefer to shop across multiple 
brands, often in search of the latest trends. On
average, only 29 percent of their wardrobe is from 
the same brand, compared to 52 percent for those 
aged 50 and above.5

Younger shoppers in the US are 15 percentage 
points (%points) more likely to explore diﬀerent 
brands compared to older generations. Similarly, 
Gen-Z in the US and China are both 9%points less 
likely to care about the brand of clothing they buy if 
they like the style.5

The share of Gen-Z consumers in the US and China 
who reported switching to cheaper fashion brands 
in the last 12 months was 10%points higher than 
older generations.5

04. Silver Spenders Consumer ShiftsThe State of Fashion 2025 Meanwhile, there is a growing “Silver Generation” 
cohort of fashion customers

Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates 
are pushing the global population of people older 
than 50 to grow faster than any other cohort.8 In 
2020, the Silver Generation aged over 50 
represented 25 percent of the global population. By 
2050, they are set to represent more than a third.9

This trend is starker in advanced economies. In the 
US, the share of the population aged over 50 will 
reach 37 percent in 2025, growing to 42 percent by
2050. More than half of the population will be aged 
over 50 in China and in the EU5a by 2050.9

Even emerging markets with relatively young 
populations will see their older cohorts grow. In

04. Silver Spenders Consumer ShiftsThe State of Fashion 2025 The Silver Generation is disproportionately 
wealthier and spends more on fashion 

Greater share of wealth
Thanks to years of accumulated wealth and steady incomes, older generations 
have more disposable cash to splurge on fashion. Those aged 55 and over in the 
US accounted for 72 percent of wealth in early 2024 — and that share is 
increasing each year.10 In the UK, the median total wealth belongs to those in 
their early 60s, whose wealth is almost 9x those in their early 30s.11

More resilience 
As a result, older generations tend to be more resilient during times of 
economic uncertainty. For example, less than 20 percent of Silver Generation 
customers in the US, EU5a and China say they tracked their spending in 2024, 
compared to more than 30 percent of Gen-Z.12

Higher spending 
People aged 50 and above represented 38 percent of total global spend in 2024 
and will drive 48 percent of global spending growth, 60 percent of growth in 
China and the US and 79 percent in the EU5 in 2025.a Even in emerging 
markets such as India that have relatively smaller older population shares, 
those aged over 50 will drive 30 percent of 2025 spending growth.13

• The Silver Generation represents a greater share of total fashion spend than 
younger shoppers, with those aged 59 and over representing 37 percent of 
2023 retail apparel spend in the US compared to 23 percent for Millennials. 
Similarly, per capita spend on clothing was 21 percent higher for those aged 
59 and over compared to Millennials and Gen-Z in the US in 2023.14

• This in part reﬂects the shifting attitudes of this cohort who increasingly 
defy age-related stereotypes. Half of women in their 50s saying they are 
now more style-conscious than when they were in their 20s.15

Silver Generation in order to capture their spend

Experiences matter
Silver Generation customers spend less time 
shopping for clothes than the average shopper: 17 
percentage points (%points) less in the US and 
36%points less in the EU. Since they are engaged in
activities like dining out and travel, brands that 
create out-of-home experiences are likely to 
capture their attention.5

They are not trend-driven
The Silver Generation cares about individual style 
but less about trends, 20%points and 16%points 
less than the average in the US and EU. As a result, 
they tend to be more brand loyal and shop from a 
smaller repertoire of brands.5

Functionality comes first 
They prioritise functionality (23%points and 
29%points above the average in the US and EU) 
and comfort (21%points and 8%points) over style. 
Brands with timeless designs and identities are 
therefore more likely to resonate with this cohort.5

Value is more important than price 
The Silver Generation in the EU prioritises value 
25%points above the average. They want versatile 
products that serve different occasions. Since they 
are not necessarily driven by trends, they are more 
likely to buy on discount or via off-price channels.5

BRANDING

New Balance has undergone a multi-year brand 
transformation, reclaiming its “dad shoe” as a 
fashion-forward, inter-generational brand. 

By reviving retro styles from the 70s, 80s and 90s, 
and collaborating with streetwear icons like Aimé
Leon Dore, Joe Freshgoods and Salehe Bembury, 
as well as celebrities such as Jack Harlow, New 
Balance has successfully reasserted its relevance
across generations. 

These efforts have successfully attracted both 
Millennials and Gen-Z while retaining appeal 
among older generations through a focus on 
nostalgia. More than 40 percent of consumers 
across age groups from 18 to 55 and over favour the 
brand.16 17 18

MARKETING

PRODUCT ASSORTMENT

After ﬁling for bankruptcy in May 2020, J.Crew has 
turned around its brand by attracting a new 
generation of customers. As a result, J.Crew is 
expected to achieve record sales in 2024.19

J.Crew aims to oﬀer a timeless, consistent 
assortment, usually only making small tweaks to 
core styles to stay relevant and broaden audience 
appeal. Its marketing highlights the longevity of 
products whilst showcasing their versatility, such as 
through “Design Try-On” videos on social media 
that appeal to a younger audience. 

Uniqlo’s LifeWear range is designed to incorporate 
functional, high-quality everyday pieces and have 
inter-generational appeal. Uniqlo reported a 17.8 
percent revenue increase in May 2024, crediting 
LifeWear as a key pillar of international growth. 21

Much of the collection is versatile by design: 90
percent of the current assortment has a simple 
design or minimal pattern, with “timeless” tones. 
Uniqlo diﬀerentiates its timeless classics by using 
technical features that provide functionality, such 
as its Heattech, Puﬀertech and Airism technologies.

Responding to consumer demand, J.Crew 
relaunched its iconic physical catalogue in 2024 
after seven years out of circulation, evoking 
nostalgia and showing that print can still work in 
fashion.20 In the US, for example, those under the 
age of 30 are just as likely to source inspiration from 
magazines as those over the age of 50.5

Uniqlo has entered long-term partnerships with 
designers such as JW Anderson and Christophe 
Lemaire, and recently named Clare Waight Keller 
creative director, which helps it to gain relevance 
with a younger, fashion-forward demographic while 
retaining the same timeless, uncomplicated designs.

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

Rethink customer segmentation

Diversify the product portfolio

Define a data-driven channel strategy

Move away from age-defined customer 
segments. Leverage data to identify the values 
and preferences that unite customers across 
age groups and use this to inform marketing 
strategy and communications. Whilst the Silver 
Generation is broadly channel agnostic about 
whether they shop in store or online, brands 
with consistent value-based communications 
that show up across channels will likely stay 
front of mind.

Consider how the assortment appeals across 
generations. To create products with both 
younger and older shoppers in mind, brands 
might introduce more fluid variants of core 
lines. To attract older customers, they might 
focus on oﬀering new technical features or 
innovative materials that cater to their unique 
preferences, such as comfort and functionality.

Adapt KPIs to ensure the long-term ROI of mature 
customers is considered when it comes to 
allocating marketing budgets and channel 
strategy. Once Silver Generation shoppers have 
bought from a brand, they tend to be more loyal, 
so brands might focus on measuring retention 
metrics for these shoppers rather than new 
customers acquired.

Physical print remains key for marketing to the 
Silver Generation, as do meaningful in-store 
experiences, while social media channels such as 
Facebook and WeChat are more popular among 
customers aged over 50.

important not to 
get so blinded by 
doing exactly 
what the 
customer thinks 
they want. You 
also need to 
inspire and 
delight them.”

You’ve been at the helm of J.Crew’s 
turnaround for the past four years, 
what was your strategy going into it?
When I took the role, it was 
November 2020, it was certainly 
a tumultuous time. There was a lot to 
do, but I didn’t have a laid-out 
strategy in place. I feel like there’s 
been a lot of learning. There’s been 
a lot of takeaways from our core 
customers, but also understanding 
about what it takes to meaningfully 
bring new people into the brand, and 
what that right mix really is for us. 

We are clear on our mission today, 
which is about building a brand that 
really embodies multi-generational 
style, and continuing to evolve to 
meet the needs of all of those 
customers. I think we are at our best 
when we do that really well. 

What major actions went into 
getting J.Crew into the shape that it 
is today? 
The ﬁrst order of business was 
making sure we felt really good about 
our creative direction. Having 
[womenswear head of design] 
Olympia [Gayot] newly onboard,
and us really getting reacquainted 
with the brand together again, then 
bringing [menswear designer] 
Brendon [Babenzien] on shortly 
thereafter, that was really critical. 

We really are at our best when we 
lead with great creative and we lead 
with great design. We're seeing 
momentum now when we release 
collections for both our new fashion 
but also our classics and our 
evolved classics. 

The other real pillar for us is the 
experience. That touches our retail 
stores, it touches our digital 
experience. Then the catalogue, 
which we relaunched this fall. 

What does J.Crew’s customer 
makeup look like today?
Our core customer really puts style 
ﬁrst, and they're fairly ageless in 
demographic. That said, many are in 
their 30s, 40s and 50s, and they’ve 
likely grown up with J.Crew. These 
are our best customers. They're our 
multi-generational customers and 
they’re bringing their kids to the 
brand, too. 

It’s also very important not to get so 
blinded by doing exactly what the 
customer thinks they want. You also 
need to inspire and delight them, so 
that's where the creative component 
and the magic that we’ve been able 
to bring back really comes in. At 
the end of the day, we strive to 
create product that really is ageless 
and timeless. 

Ten years ago, J.Crew really 
struggled with balancing a fashion-
forward oﬀering under Lyons while 
still serving its older customers who 
have shopped with the brand for 
years. How have you been able 
to address this issue of balance 
in assortment? 
A primary issue that I’d observed 
coming in was really our need to get 
back to a creative and design-forward 
approach to the brand that also 
embraced our heritage and our 
classics, and really ﬁnding that 
sweet spot.

We are not a trendy brand. We are a 
brand that is ultimately rooted in 
heritage and classics. Some of those 
pieces are evolved, they feel modern, 
and some actually remain quite 
traditional. Balance is critical to 
making sure you’re not alienating 
your core customer, and then you’re 
exciting a newer customer who might 
come in. 

So, we’re seeing a lovely balance of 
people connecting and coming back 
into the brand, and then we're seeing 
a really nice rate of acquisition 
coming in under age 30. It's the 
balance of the product. It's the 
balance of the storytelling, and at the 
end of the day, you have to keep that 
core customer in mind.

58

04. Silver Spenders Consumer ShiftsThe State of Fashion 2025 What goes into the design process 
in maintaining that balance? 
It’s a constant dialogue we have here. 
‘Should we keep this item in? Should 
we move forward? How much should 
we tweak this bestselling style? How 
much should we let it go?’ Luckily, 
we’re sitting on a lot of great 
customer data and product-selling 
information. We talk a lot to our 
customers. We have a lot of access 
now to our customers, and through 
all of that, we really have found, 
I think, a really nice sweet spot 
of maintaining that balance.

If we’re delivering on a trend, for 
example, the barn jacket is trending 
today, and we had this incredible 
vintage version, which we did a 
release of and it sells out in minutes 
— incredible. But we also have in our 
oﬀering a [new version] of the 
original barn jacket on our men’s 
side and a waxed and cropped 
version on our women's side, too. 
So, having those iterations of 
what’s heritage to us but delivering 
iterations in a way that feels really 
modern and relevant has really been 
the crux of our product formula.

How has J.Crew adapted its supply 
chain to meet the needs of its new 
design strategy? 
As you know, we are not fast fashion. 
We do believe [in] allowing time for 
the creative process and the design 
process. We have a lot of Italian 
fabrics that we use that require quite 
a bit of lead time. We haven’t tried to 
trim our calendar to adapt to a 
[faster] fashion cycle. That said, we 
do believe that there’s opportunities 
that come up all the time.

What we have done over the past 
four years is really establish a faster 
cycle, a cycle that allows us to react 
to what’s happening in our own 
business and react to what's 
happening out there in the world to 
become more dynamic. I think you 
have to be dynamic, even if you want 
to really protect the longer-term 
creative storytelling. I think it’s very 
easy for a brand to swing the 
pendulum one way or the other. 
I think you just have to be nimble 
but, at the same time, you have to 
really be careful about maintaining 
the integrity of the product that 
you’re delivering.

04. Silver Spenders Consumer ShiftsThe State of Fashion 2025 What is the role of distribution in 
reaching all your different segments 
of customers?  
It’s important to recognise where the 
different audiences are and meet 
them where they are. This means 
delivering on the store experience is 
going to feel different than something 
you're going to see on the website, 
which has become a channel of 
convenience. The store has really 
been about a celebration of the 
best of brand.

I think when you think about those 
two channels, they’re actually 
switched in a way compared to 10 
years ago, when people really did 
stop by the store to pick things up. 
Stores were the channel 
of convenience. 

Today, with the ease and the 
convenience of the online shop, it just 
made a lot more sense for us to 
demonstrate the best of the brand in 
the stores, which is one of the most 
important platforms for us. 

There are many different ways we can 
show up in the world and there’s a 
moment to celebrate things 
differently on TikTok versus 
Instagram, for instance. Letting go 
a little bit more on certain platforms, 
where it just makes sense for people

to feel more authentic and more 
organic, and then using other 
platforms for really being as 
inspirational and aspirational as 
we need to be. 

catalogue, that this story is for a 
younger customer, or this story is 
for an older customer. It really does 
feel pretty ageless when you open 
that book. 

Why bring back the catalogue now? 
The loudest and the clearest feedback 
that we got from customers was, 
‘Please bring back the catalogue.’ I 
knew when I started that we weren’t 
ready, because I knew that the magic 
of the catalogue was really about the 
storytelling and really being able to 
stand behind the product, so I allowed 
us to really take our time. 
We really don’t think about it 
creatively when we’re developing the 

Engagement around the brand that 
brings the catalogue and the store 
together has been, I would say, an 
unanticipated wonderful moment for 
us. It really connects all the parts of 
why people love this brand. The 
customer component obviously is 
really critical, and having the stores be 
so meaningful again, it’s just so 
refreshing for those of us who’ve been 
in this business for a long time. I think 
it just really reiterates the importance 

60

of the physical connection and the 
excitement that people have for 
shopping in general, connecting with 
brands they love, and the importance 
of, not just great marketing, but 
actually delivering great product and 
great experience behind that 
marketing.

05. Value Shift Macroeconomic pressures and rising prices have driven fashion
shoppers to adopt cost-conscious behaviours. This is expected to persist, even as 
some economies begin showing signs of recovery. This dynamic is fuelling growth 
in segments with strong value-for-money perception, such as resale, off-price and 
dupes, among others. To capture customers’ share of wallet, brands will need to 
prove their value. 

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

• Fashion customers consistently adopt cost-conscious 
shopping behaviours, with 64 percent of US shoppers 
trading down in the third quarter of 2024.

• Over 70 percent of customers plan to purchase from 
outlets or oﬀ-price retailers in the next 12 months, 
even if their discretionary budget increased.

• Nearly one in three US adults say they intentionally 

bought a dupe of a premium or luxury product. Half 
say they bought it for cost savings, while 17 percent 
would continue to purchase dupes even if they could 
aﬀord the original item.

•

Identify a brand value proposition that resonates with 
customers based on their trade-down behaviour and 
definition of "value," by focusing on price or quality, for 
example.

• Emphasise value in brand communications to earn 

customers’ trust and convince them a product is worth 
purchasing. 

• Consider embedding value into the product proposition 
and channel strategy. Determine whether launching 
new value-orientated products, price points or 
channels, such as resale or outlets, would appeal to 
shoppers, while protecting core brand equity.

save money on clothing, footwear 
and accessories3

In 2022, consumer conﬁdence indexes in the US, 
Eurozone and China hit their lowest levels since 
2005, and conﬁdence in China once again neared 
record lows in August 2024. Across markets, 
shopper uncertainty about macroeconomic 
conditions remains. In the ﬁrst half of 2024, 
consumer conﬁdence was about 10 to 30 points 
below 2019 averages across the Eurozone, US and 
China, though conﬁdence levels in the Eurozone 
and US are ticking up slightly from 2023.2

Intent to spend on discretionary categories such as 
fashion remains low. Over 40 percent of shoppers 
in the US, UK and Germany are spending less on 
clothing, footwear and accessories than they did a 
year ago.3

Consumers are not only looking to spend less, but 
they are also trying to stretch their money further. 
Over 60 percent of consumers in the US and UK 
say they are attempting to save money on fashion 
“often” or “as much as possible.” In the US, this 
ﬁgure is as high as 75 percent.3

Shoppers across income levels are trading down, 
changing the type of product or quantity purchased 
in pursuit of better value, but their behaviour varies 
by segment. While value and mid-market shoppers 
tend to buy from outlets or oﬀ-price retailers (>33 
percent) or search for the best price for an item 
(>31 percent), premium shoppers are more likely to 
leverage “buy now, pay later” services (16 percent) 
or use resale platforms to save (23 percent). Premium 
customers embrace certain trade-down behaviours 
even more than customers from other segments; a 
greater share say they have purchased a cheaper 
replica, or “dupe,” of the product they wanted 
compared to value and mid-market shoppers.3

behaviours are likely to persist

Behaviours that customers would continue even if they had more money to spend, 
% 

Shoppers are not eager to increase their fashion 
budgets, even as economic prospects and consumer 
sentiment improve in some regions. Over 80 
percent of shoppers plan to spend the same or less 
on clothing, footwear and accessories in 2025.3

An “inﬂation overhang,” the idea that customers 
take time to adjust to higher prices, is not the only 
dynamic at play. Even customers with growing 
discretionary spend are prioritising experiences 
and travel over fashion. In the third quarter of 
2024, the top category that US and European 
customers splurged on was eating out, followed by 
travel and buying groceries.4

The survey also revealed the stickiness of value-
seeking shopper behaviour. When asked which 
categories they would spend on (e.g. groceries, 
clothing, activities) given higher discretionary 
spend, over 70 percent say they would continue 
certain trade-down behaviours in their fashion 
purchases.3

Deep dive to follow

Purchase from an outlet or off-price retailer

Hunt down the best price for the product

Wait until the product goes on discount

Buy or sell products on resale websites

Purchase from a discounter or a private label

Buy a cheaper version (i.e. "dupe") of the product

Shop from a lower price retailer than normal

“Value” can take on diﬀerent meanings. For some, it 
might mean shopping pre-owned or buying on sale, 
for others it might mean buying fewer, higher 
quality items.

retailers and outlets

2024 vs the broader market5

Oﬀ-price retailers have continued to grow 
revenues and improve proﬁtability despite broader 
market turbulence, this year’s McKinsey Global 
Fashion Index (MGFI) analysis shows. Traditional 
oﬀ-price retailers Burlington, Ross and TJX are 
expected to grow revenues by a weighted average 
of 4.6 percent in 2024, compared to a 2.6 percent 
average for publicly listed fashion companies. Ross 
and TJX were also among the MGFI Super 
Winners list, leading in industry economic proﬁt in 
2023.5

Outlet channels are also beneﬁtting from this 
dynamic. In the ﬁrst half of 2024, Zalando’s 
business-to-consumer (B2C) channel proﬁtability 
rose 1.4 percentage points year on year and 
revenue grew by 0.6 percent.6 Meanwhile, e-

convince shoppers that they are worth the price

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

Identify value drivers

Communicate value

Integrate value into the channel and 
product strategy

Identify the “value proposition” that 
resonates with customers, whether rooted in 
quality or affordable prices.

Convince consumers of the defined value 
proposition through eﬀective brand 
communication. 

Attract value-minded shoppers through 
alternative channels and diﬀerentiated 
products, while protecting core brand equity. 

As “value” can take on different meanings, 
brands will need to identify which value-
seeking behaviours drive their customers 
and tailor their strategies accordingly. 
Shopper surveys, social listening and 
analysis of customer relationship 
management data can all be effective ways 
to identify what shoppers care about in 
terms of value.

Create campaigns that highlight the 
craftsmanship and quality of products, the 
innovation behind them or competitive prices to 
justify a purchase to shoppers.

Leverage non-traditional channels to meet 
consumers where they are — and where they will 
be receptive. Organic influencer content, 
shopper forums and social media platforms such 
as TikTok can all be powerful ways to influence 
consumers’ brand perception.

Leverage owned outlets and resale platforms to 
attract entry-level shoppers who may one day 
buy at full price. Additionally, resale can give 
brands more control over the quality of their 
secondhand goods in circulation, with the 
bonus eﬀect of increasing circularity. 

Consider “premiumisation” of select product 
lines to showcase value through quality of 
materials and durability.

time when consumers are rebelling against higher prices. 

BY BRIAN BASKIN

Plenty of brands talk about world building, but few 
are as committed to the concept as Ralph Lauren, 
which recently recreated its Polo Bar restaurant at 
a Hamptons estate to wine and dine guests 
attending its latest fashion show. 

It was one of the showier bits of “Ralph’s world,” the 
all-encompassing concept that has served as the 
linchpin of a strategy to elevate the brand’s image, 
allowing it to expand into high-margin categories 
such as outerwear and handbags while still selling 
plenty of polo shirts. The goal is to make sure that, 

however customers come into Ralph’s world, they 
feel like they’re getting good value for their 
investment.

Consumers appear to be on board: Ralph Lauren’s 
stores are busy, even as the average price of the 
goods sold in them has risen over 70 percent since 
2018. So are investors — the company’s stock hit an 
all-time high in October 2024. 

But the elevation project now faces its greatest test 
yet, as shoppers around the world demonstrate 

fatigue with spiralling prices and China’s sluggish 
economy clouds the outlook for a once-promising 
market. As it navigates the turbulence, Ralph 
Lauren is doubling down on its storytelling and 
leaning into the core products that have given the 
brand its longevity.

“This range of 
product enables 
us to connect 
with all types of 
consumers. 
We'll appeal to 
the uber-rich 
and we'll appeal 
to people who 
will buy a piece 
of the dream.”

So many brands have been raising 
prices and elevating their image. 
There’s a sense in the market that 
there’s perhaps a bit of fatigue with 
that among consumers. I'm curious 
if that's been your experience. 
We’ve been on a multi-year journey 
regarding our brand elevation. Brand 
elevation means elevate the 
storytelling, elevate the product, 
elevate the shopping experience. The 
outcome is the ability to price. 

We often get compared to a lot of the 
other companies in that we’re [raising 
like-for-like prices]. I don’t view us as 
taking pricing. I view us as driving 
elevation, making sure that the 
consumer value is there. Because for 
the pricing to stick, you need the 
consumer to feel like this is a good 
investment. 

I think every consumer cares about 
value. Whether you’re a billionaire or 
whether you’re scraping by on $12 an 
hour, every consumer cares about 
value and making sure they're putting 
money into something that reﬂects 
what they care about. 

When you talk about the value 
proposition, what does that look like 
for your top customers and for the 
customers who are more 
aspirational?

First, everyone is buying into a piece 
of the Ralph Lauren world. Whether 
you want to be a banker on Wall 
Street, whether you want to be a 
horseback rider in the Hamptons, 
whether you want to be a cowboy in 
Colorado, we create these movie sets. 
The products are the props. The 
consumers [are] the actors. That’s 
true whether you’re a VIC who 
spends $1 million with us in one pop 
to refurnish your entire house or 
whether you're going to one of our 
outlets and you're looking for 
a polo shirt. 

Then we leverage the breadth of the 
portfolio that we have. What’s pretty 
special is we sell $100,000 watches 
and you can have a pack of T-shirts. 
This range of product enables us to 
connect with all types of consumers. 
We’ll appeal to the uber-rich and we’ll 
appeal to people who will buy a piece 
of the dream, but they may not buy 
the $100,000 watch.

I think people intuitively understand 
how the $100,000 watch connects to 
[Ralph’s] world. Tell me how that 
looks for the pack of T-shirts or the 
polo shirt.
As a consumer, I’m connecting with 
three things. I'm connecting with the 
storytelling. That touches everybody 
now. We have dramatically increased 

our marketing investment. It’s now 
about 7 percent of total company 
revenue. It was 3.3 percent a few 
years back [in ﬁscal 2017]. We’re 
using broad storytelling, like the 
timeless campaign we just did [titled 
“Ralph’s New York”], and then we 
have more targeted marketing 
activities that go after diﬀerent 
consumer groups. 

The second is all the work that we do 
on the product and celebrating the 
product and making sure it’s superior 
quality, making sure it’s got timeless 
style, making sure it’s something that 
you can wear in ﬁve years, or you can 
wear in 10 years. 

Then the third area is the shopping 
experience. Often, people focus 
exclusively on stores. For us, the 
elevation applies to every single 
touchpoint the consumer has with 
our brand. So, whether that's our 
website, whether that’s our outlets, 
whether that's the work we do with 
our wholesale partners, to make sure 
that they’re getting this unique 
experience. 

I think the combination of the three is 
what enables us to appeal to someone 
who just wants a polo shirt or 
someone who wants to refurnish their 
entire house.

05. Value Shift Consumer ShiftsThe State of Fashion 2025 Let’s talk about the last show, 
the one in the Hamptons. How were 
you using that to reach your VICs, 
and then, also, for that larger 
world building?
We actually don't do fashion shows. 
Yes, we have models on the runway 
[but] we do brand-cultural moments, 
and we invite you into a movie. The 
movie in [September] was set in the 
Hamptons. 

The shows I like the most are the ones 
that showcase the entire portfolio. 
So you have our luxury business 
collection, Purple Label, Polo, men’s, 
women's and children's. Then, the 
way we activate the show is again 
through every single touchpoint. If 
you’re a VIC, we'll give you the option 
to come and join us at the show. We 
might have in our stores a viewing 
of the show. We will leverage it on 
our social media platforms pretty 
actively. 

The idea is to have a surround-sound 
marketing programme and to appeal 
to a broad group of both our current 
consumers and future consumers. 
What we're ﬁnding with these cultural 
moments is they appeal very broadly 

and they’re an incredible way to 
recruit new consumers, which is the 
lifeblood of this company.

How have stores evolved over 
the course of this elevation project 
compared to say, ﬁve or six 
years ago?
First, you will now have the ability to 
walk into many more stores. That's 
been an important part of our 
elevation as we put more emphasis on 
direct-to-consumer. 

There’s been a lot of innovation in 
terms of the types of stores based on 
the city that we’re in. We focus on 
[our] top-30 cities. Earlier this week, 
we opened a new store in Shenzhen. 
It's a really modern take on the Ralph 
Lauren experience, which ﬁts nicely in 
Shenzhen. I don't know that we could 
do that on Madison Avenue. 

We haven’t renovated our ﬂagships for 
many, many years. We believe in 
vintage, but there's a point where 
consumer experience shouldn't 
necessarily be vintage, so we just 
renovated our Chicago store. We 
added the coﬀee shop. Coﬀee has just
been an incredible success, well
beyond our wildest dreams. We’re 
leveraging hospitality. 

We are putting more emphasis on 
clienteling. In London, we just 
renovated an entire ﬂoor in our new 
Bond Street store, which now looks 
and feels like a Ralph Lauren 

71

apartment. That’s where our VICs can 
come. They can spend the day

apartment. That’s where our VICs can 
come. They can spend the day there 
with their families.

We’re weaving technology in. You will 
have seen these endless-aisle screens 
where you can have access in our store 
to now the entire range. We want 
people to be able to tap into our full 
lifestyle. We don't just sell denim. We 
don’t just sell handbags. You want to 
buy a sofa? We have a sofa. You want 
to buy a polo shirt? We have that too.

05. Value Shift Consumer ShiftsThe State of Fashion 2025 China’s been a bit of a troubled 
market, especially for higher-end 
Western brands. Ralph Lauren has 
been more optimistic. What are you 
seeing there that others aren’t?
China is a big opportunity for us short, 
mid, and long term, and we’ve got very 
good momentum there. We have a 
very focused strategy on the top-six 
cities, which I think is a diﬀerentiator 
versus some of the other players. 
Arguably, we are underdeveloped 
relative to other luxury brands, 
because China is about 8 percent of 
our [sales]. It used to be about 3 
percent before Covid, so we're 
growing nicely, but others are 20 
percent, 30 percent, 40 percent of 
their business, which also indicates 
the size of the opportunity for us. 

On the product side, our most 
elevated products are what we’re 
selling actually in China. We were 
talking value earlier. The consumer's 
clearly seeing the value in those more 
elevated products, so think beautiful 
linen suits, think wonderful cashmere 
turtlenecks. We're going to continue 
to lean into that.

This is a time where consumers, given 
the uncertainty and the anxiety — and 
there’s a lot of that in China — are 
leaning into brands they know, 
products they trust, product 

categories they're familiar with. So 
many of our items are classics and 
what we call ‘core.’ Like 70 percent of 
our business is core, which you can 
get season on season, as opposed to 
fashion, where everything really 
changes from season to season. We’re 
known for these icons [like the] cable 
knit sweater, polo shirt, Oxford shirt, 
tweed jacket, leather outerwear, and 
that's really resonating nicely with the 
consumer right now. 

Is that [70 percent core, 30 percent 
fashion] a stable ratio?
We’ve actually made a signiﬁcant 
change to lean much more into core. 
Some of our businesses used to be 20 
percent core, 80 percent fashion. 
We’ve concluded that that's not our 
game. Our game is iconic products 
that consumers recognise, love [and] 
trust, year on year, generation on 
generation. We’ve leaned much more 
into that, including in the women's 
business, which is historically known 
to be much more fashion-driven. 

Rather than look to change everything 
every season, there’s so much to build 
on. There’s so much of our core that 
consumers trust, that a number of 
consumers actually don’t know yet.

Category expansion is a big tentpole 
of this strategy. How are you 

evaluating which categories to invest 
in next?
Because Ralph Lauren’s such a broad 
lifestyle brand, it's actually 
challenging because there are so 
many things we could actually do. The 
ﬁlter we look at is how does it ﬁt with 
the overall brand equity, the 
categories, and then it’s size of prize, 
diﬃculty of the dive. We're close to a 
$7 billion company, on our way to 10, 
so we’re looking for big building 
blocks. 

Then, what are the capabilities or
expertise required to be able to be 
credible because our mindset is if 
we're going to play in an area, it's not 
to participate; it's to win. We're not 
interested in being number 55 in a 
category. We want to be in a 
leadership position. That's been 
Ralph’s philosophy from the get-go. 

If you double-click on that, where you 
land is what we’re driving now, which 
is women’s apparel, outerwear, 
handbags. I think those are pretty 
evergreen given the size of the 
businesses. Right? If you ask me, ‘‘ 

‘When do you think you’ve fully 
tapped into the potential of these 
three categories? Two years? Three 
years?’ I'd tell you it's probably 10 
plus. There are so many other things 

72

that come into this oﬃce in terms of, 
‘Could we do this? Could we do that?’ 
and the answer is, ‘Yes, later.’

Any ﬁnal thoughts you wanted to 
add here?
I think there’s a lot of negativity right 
now around the luxury space. Yes, 
some big [brands] are struggling, but 
there are companies winning, and if 
you look at what’s driving that, it's the 
strength of the brand and the 
relevancy of the brand. It's the focus 
on core, recognisable, authentic, 
timeless products, and then it's a real 
attention to the shopping experience 
and really walking in the consumer’s 
shoes in terms of what they’re looking 
for. I'm optimistic about where this 
business is and where it can go. It's 
going to have ebbs and ﬂows, but I 
think the negativism is probably 
overblown.

06. The Human Side of Sales Diﬀerentiating the in-store experience is key 
to reigniting demand for in-person shopping. Brands can achieve that by 
empowering their store associates to reach their full potential, as sales staﬀ have 
a central and valuable role to play in connecting with customers. The beneﬁts 
will be sizeable, since customer and employee experience are inextricably linked.

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

• Store associates can be a key diﬀerentiator in customer 

satisfaction across regions, according to the BoF-
McKinsey State of Fashion 2025 Consumer Survey.

• 75 percent of shoppers are likely to spend more after 
receiving high-quality service from store personnel, 
indicating upsell and cross-sell opportunities.

• A 2024 study found that more than 20 percent of 

missed sales at a prominent US retailer were related to 
issues with store associates, such as suboptimal 
engagement or unavailability of staﬀ.

• Enable store personnel with training and tools to 
change the way they interact with customers, 
reorientating focus towards product expertise and 
relationship-building, using new technologies to arm 
staﬀ with analytical insights.

• Motivate in-store staﬀ by broadening incentive 

structures beyond immediate, in-person sales goals to 
longer-term omnichannel customer development.

• Optimise processes via automation or digitisation in 
customer interactions where human touch is less 
valued, thereby freeing up store associates' time to 
focus on key conversion drivers.

• Evolve the store associate role to focus on career 

progression and the interpersonal aspects of the job, 
such as connecting with customers, which will help 
retain employees in today’s competitive hiring 
environment.

06. The Human Side of SalesFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 It will be imperative to maximise customer 
engagement amid slowing in-store sales in 2025

Now that the post-pandemic ﬂurry of customers 
returning to stores has begun to cool, in-store sales 
growth is forecast to be around 1 to 2 percent on 
average across key markets in 2025, compared to 
the last few years of high single-digit to double-digit 
growth.1

This normalisation comes as store foot traﬃc is 
approaching pre-pandemic levels across regions.2
Some markets like continental Europe anticipate 
surpassing their pre-pandemic oﬄine market size in 
2024.1

However, the role of the store has evolved globally. 
It is estimated that almost 70 percent of retail sales 
today are digitally inﬂuenced, making stores more 
of a destination for conversion and building brand 
loyalty than initial discovery.2 54 percent of apparel 
shoppers say they prefer to buy clothing in brick-
and-mortar locations versus online.3

As store growth decelerates, retailers will need to 
further diﬀerentiate their store experience from the 
competition to convert customers in stores. While 
retailers have been focused on delivering digital 
innovations in store, in doing so they have 
deprioritised some of the basics that shoppers 
returned to stores for in the ﬁrst place, such as the 
human side of sales.

Must-have hygienic factors: Non-human 
elements of the shopping journey and store 
characteristics tend to be must-haves or hygienic 
factors.

These elements drive both high satisfaction when 
present and dissatisfaction when not present, but 
do not tend to differentiate the experience or 
increase sales.6

Differentiating factors: Human interactions such 
as interactions with store associates tend to be key 
differentiators of the in-store experience. 

These boost shopper delight and are key drivers of 
conversion and loyalty, since these exchanges are 
only possible in stores.6 

Human interactions are particularly important to 
aspirational and younger consumers. The former 
are up to 2x as likely to seek styling advice from 
staff compared to value and mid-market shoppers, 
and the latter are 1.5x as likely compared to 
shoppers over the age of 50.6

Note: Satisfaction indicates a high level of satisfaction (9-10 on a 10-
point scale). Drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction are 
determined based on a correlation analysis of shopper net 
sentiment towards elements of in-store experience vs level of 
satisfaction

Shoppers are the least satisﬁed with human 
interactions in their store experiences, scoring as 
much as 25 percentage points (%points) below 
other aspects on average, including ﬁtting rooms 
and checkout transactions and store atmosphere.6

Satisfaction with store staﬀ is lower in the US, UK 
and Germany compared to China, where shoppers 
are around half as satisﬁed.6

While satisfaction is low across age groups, 
shoppers under the age of 30 show higher net 
satisfaction of 43 percent compared to 32 percent 
for those aged 50 and above. In contrast, older 
shoppers tend to be more delighted by the store 
atmosphere.6

In 2023, 75 percent of global companies across 
industries reported operating without enough 
frontline employees.9

The labour shortage is particularly pronounced in 
retail. As of May 2024, there were 2.5 million more 
retail job vacancies than job seekers in the US. 
More than 44 percent of US retail workers are 
planning to leave their jobs within three to six 
months.8

This is also evident in the luxury sector, where 
some ﬂagships in Paris reported operating with staﬀ 
shortages of 20 percent in 2024. Industry leader 
LVMH forecasts it will need to recruit 22,000 new 
workers by the end of 2025, nearly two thirds being 
sales associates.10

In the past few years, US retail wage growth has 
outpaced other sectors. Since the pandemic, retail 
hourly wages have increased by over 20 percent vs 
11 percent in the private sector.11

Retail pay growth in the UK continues to outpace 
other sectors. In August, pay was up 9 percent year 
on year.12 This was partially driven by the near 10 
percent increase in the national living wage in April 
2024, which impacted a significant portion of the 
frontline retail population.13 14

Rising workforce costs are making the industry’s 
high turnover more costly. Losing a single frontline 
retail employee can cost a retailer $2,000 to 
$10,000 on average. Costs tend to be higher for 
managerial positions and more experienced 
employees. Multiplied by thousands of employees 
across multiple years, those costs can weigh on a 
retailer’s bottom line.

06. The Human Side of SalesFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Upskilling staﬀ and investing in tech support tools 
will enable better customer interactions 

UPSKILLING STORE STAFF

OPTIMISING CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS WITH TECH

Upskilling and training store associates is the top priority for executives aiming 
to improve sales and customer engagement in stores in 2025.15

More than half of fashion executives agree that the use of digital tools to 
facilitate omnichannel sales will be a key priority in the year ahead.15

Professional development of store associates has long been a priority for 
retailers, given the young and inexperienced workforce (more than 30 percent 
of all ﬁrst jobs in the US are in retail).16 However, the focus on training is 
expected to increase in the year ahead.  

As staﬀ turnover continues to rise, retailers will need to increase the speed and 
cost-eﬃciency of training. Formats like AI-powered training and micro-
learning, where content is broken into small chunks, will play an increasingly 
important role.

Training has a positive impact on employee satisfaction and retention. One 
large retailer that implemented college-level courses and skills certiﬁcation 
found its employees were four times more likely to stay in their jobs.8

As store associates shift to focus more on customer interactions, it will be 
important to arm them with the tools and knowledge to meaningfully engage 
with customers. New customer relationship management (CRM) enabled 
technologies can help store associates get real-time information about the 
customer they are interacting with to make for a better store experience. 

Luxury and non-luxury brands alike have begun using technology to track 
engagement and connect with customers after they leave the store, while 
others are providing staﬀ with data-backed, personalised customer 
recommendations for cross-sell and upsell opportunities in store.

06. The Human Side of SalesFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Employee incentives should reward customer 
lifetime value and reﬂect modern shopping habits

Creating staﬀ incentives that prioritise customer 
interactions and relationship-building can increase 
both sales and employee satisfaction. When 
incentives align with the parts of work employees 
deem meaningful, they can feel more fulﬁlled and 
appreciated.

For any sort of incentive, the key performance 
indicators of staﬀ success need to reﬂect new ways 
of working. Changes might include rewarding staﬀ
based on onboarding new loyalty members or 
driving omnichannel sales, such as digital sales 
ordered in store.

Revised incentives are required to reward customer 
lifetime value over individual transactions and 
better reﬂect modern shopping journeys. Browsing 
in store remains an inﬂuential channel for learning 
about products, yet as of 2021 only 31 percent of 
businesses measured the contribution of stores to 
digital sales, and vice versa.21 22

customer-satisfaction drivers

DEPLOYING STORE STAFF INTELLIGENTLY

STREAMLINING MANUAL TASKS

Retailers are increasingly adopting data-driven approaches to staﬀ
deployment, improving both how and where staﬀ allocate their time.

Leading retailers are capturing data on transactions and footfall, including 
movements within store, to make better scheduling decisions. 

Additionally, they are testing diﬀerent approaches to understand where human 
capital is best deployed to drive incremental sales. For example, a US-based 
sportswear brand reworked its staﬀ deployment model after learning that staﬀ
coverage of the ﬁtting rooms was key to driving both sales and basket size 
through cross-selling and upselling.26

Retailers can leverage technology to automate and streamline activities such 
as digital task management, ordering and production planning, which can free 
up employee time for more customer-centric activities. 

Although the technology is not new, unlocking the full value of radio-frequency 
identiﬁers (RFID) in store operations should continue to be a priority for 
retailers in the year ahead. Correct implementation of RFID across inventory-
related store processes can lead to a 10 to 15 percent reduction in associated 
labour hours.29

Additionally, brands are increasingly testing customer-facing RFID use cases 
that make the customer experience more seamless while freeing up store 
associate time. Though nascent, RFID self-checkout is set to expand in the 
coming year; Radar, a technology company that works with major apparel 
retailers such as American Eagle, plans to launch its RFID-powered checkout 
function in 2024.30

06. The Human Side of SalesFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 To improve employee experience, retailers should 
prioritise development and human interactions

In retail, there are six main factors that impact employee retention. US 
employees plan to leave their jobs primarily due to concerns about career 
development, citing limited growth opportunities. Compensation issues rank 
second, inﬂuenced by macroeconomic pressures. Employees passionate about 
the industry, however, tend to cite these factors as reasons to stay, hence
investments in career development and compensation can be a “win-win” for 
retailers looking to reduce the high costs of staﬀ turnover.8  

This underscores the importance of deﬁning a company-speciﬁc target 
employee proﬁle, whether that be career brand enthusiasts, retirees looking for 
a store discount or part-timers seeking ﬂexibility.

Improved employee experience can make for more satisﬁed, tenured 
workforces and more satisﬁed customers, too. Companies with top-quartile 
employee experience are twice as likely to have top-quartile customer 
experience.8

Employees with high satisfaction tend to have a higher calibre of output as they 
typically are more tenured and make fewer errors on the job. Retail workers 
also value customer interactions, citing “relational” elements of the job as a key 
part of why they deem the work meaningful.8

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

Enable staﬀ with training and tools 
to improve customer interactions

Motivate store associates with 
broader incentive structures

Optimise processes to refocus store 
personnel on high-value activities

Upskill store personnel by arming them with 
the knowledge and tools needed to improve 
customer satisfaction and engagement. This 
can include training them on relationship 
management and product expertise, as well 
as providing them with tools and real-time 
customer analytics to improve product 
recommendations.

Extend both hard and soft incentives to drive 
conversion and longer-term customer value, 
rewarding associates who drive future digital 
purchases in addition to immediate, in-person 
ones. Have corporate and in-store management 
champion the goals to illustrate how they are 
valued by the entire organisation.

Automate and digitise select manual 
processes, such as merchandising and returns, 
to rework the role of store personnel in a way 
that drives customer conversion. Identify 
where to deploy sales associates versus 
automated or self-service options by analysing 
the key turning points in conversion that will 
maximise return on investment.

Retain employees with coaching 
and one-to-one interactions

Make changes to employee benefits to attract 
and retain high-quality store personnel, 
tailoring changes to the target employee and 
their motivations. In doing so, career 
development pathways will be essential in 
driving retention and brand buy-in. Leading 
retailers can achieve this by oﬀering academy-
style courses that fully immerse their 
associates.

Aritzia: Redeﬁning Shopping 
One Store at a Time

Not so long ago, Aritzia was a little-known 
womenswear brand serving elevated workwear 
staples from a modest footprint of stores. CEO 
Jennifer Wong talks about how the retailer found 
itself in hypergrowth — and why excellence starts 
from within the company.

track to triple sales from ﬁscal 2021, becoming a 
bona ﬁde powerhouse in the North American retail 
landscape. 

The company has consistently expanded since 
launching in Vancouver 40 years ago, but it wasn’t 
until after the pandemic that its growth shifted into 
hyperdrive. Of course, a fashion cycle favouring 
minimalist wardrobe staples — Ariztia’s bread-and-
butter — helped fuel that acceleration. But it was 
chief executive Jennifer Wong’s comprehensive 

Walk into any of Aritzia’s 124 locations and fans

“That's probably 
one of the 
biggest 
diﬀerentiators, 
but once you're 
in the store, it's 
the people. We 
have amazing 
people that love 
what they do.”

What’s the role of retail at Aritzia? 
This is our 40th year in business, and 
we started out as a traditional retailer. 
If it could be in our blood, I feel like 
it’s in our blood. 

Retailing today is a lot different than 
it was in 1984 when we opened our 
first store, but many things have 
stayed the same. Clients still want 
exceptional experiences. They want 
interesting and beautiful products 
that they can wear, that they can trust.

The biggest change has been the store 
format. It went from roughly 1,500 
square feet to around 10,000 square 
feet on average today, and we're 
looking forward to opening stores in 
the New York area that are even 
bigger than that. This creates a whole 
different dynamic, including being 
able to have cafes, and food and 
beverage.

shopping for, whatever their style 
preferences are.

The first thing to do is to connect and 
get a read. Once we're able to 
determine what the client is looking 
for, it starts off a relationship where 
the client then sees how beneficial it is 
to work with a style advisor. At the 
same time, if you get the ‘I'm just 
browsing’ response, I think that's 
obviously the cue, and thankfully, our 
style advisors are ‘people’ people.
We really believe in a personalised 
relationship and so when you walk 
into our stores, it is highly 
personalised in that we are inspired 
by the luxury brands. Many of our 
style advisors have literal 
relationships with the client where the 
client comes back time and time 
again, seeking out the style advisor 
because they've established a 
relationship. 

How is Aritzia able to ensure 
a high level of customer service 
in its stores? 
We have a world-class training 
programme. We believe in servicing 
so it's not just about selling. It's about 
making sure that we make a 
connection with the customer, and 
understand what it is they're looking 
for, and being able to showcase and 
offer whatever occasion they're 

How does Aritzia approach visual 
merchandising and the power of 
in-store display? 
It’s about presenting our product in 
any given season in a way that we 
think is appealing to the customer 
walking in. We have client favourites 
interspersed among new items that 
we're introducing for the season, and 
I think the combination of the two 
inspires the client. We style the 

mannequins in a way to show 
different ways of wearing a single 
item. We can visually display on a 
mannequin many different ways to 
style a blazer, so it's dressed up a little 
bit or literally with a baseball cap. 

What are other colourful 
components that go into crafting an 
in-store experience that people 
wouldn’t necessarily think of?
The biggest differentiator for us is our 
locations. We position our stores in 
the best locations that we can possibly 
secure, whether it’s SoHo, whether 
it's Fifth Avenue, whether it's the 
triple-A shopping centres we're in, 
and it’s not just the shopping centres 
themselves. It’s the actual location in 
those shopping centres. 

Our stores are our number one 
marketing vehicle, making sure we are 
where the foot traffic is, and where 
the eyeballs are. That's probably one 
of the biggest differentiators, but once 
you’re in the store, it’s the people. We 
have amazing people that love what 
they do.

At the end of the day, there's an 
energy when you walk in, and that 
energy is created by the humans in the 
store. We have a tremendous team. 
Fifteen percent of our people have 
been with us for 10 years or longer.

Can you talk a little bit about 
the sales associate recruitment 
and retention process? You 
famously began your career as 
a style advisor, and you ended up 
where you are today. 
Yes, I'm the perfect example of 
someone who started as a part-time 
style advisor, thought I'd go into 
banking and ﬁnance when I graduated 
from university, and here I am 37 
years later as the CEO and very proud 
of my career here. 

When I’m asked, why have you 
stayed at Aritzia for so long, there are 
three things. The ﬁrst is, I've never 
had to go anywhere else for a career 
opportunity. Being at Aritzia where 
we're growing and we’re doing new 
things, there are tonnes of 
opportunities. The second piece is I 
really do truly love the people I work 
with. They are exceptionally smart 
people that are intellectually 
stimulating when I come to work. 
They make me better. They keep the 

bar high. Then the third piece is it is 
very rewarding to be associated with a 
successful brand. It's rewarding to 
have a clear perspective personally, 
and when you're performing well, it's 
rewarding ﬁnancially, too. 

One of the things that we do is we 
attract amazing talent, people who are 
passionate about fashion, love 
working with our clients, strive for 
excellence, and share the same values 
for creativity. At the same time, we 

also really believe in promoting from 
within. You can have a career track 
here in many diﬀerent ways. Creative 
product track, operations track, sales 
track, management track. There's a 
clear track that you can embark on, 
and once you’re in, we like to think 
that that is the beginning of the 
pipeline for our talent and our 
leadership.

85

06. The Human Side of SalesFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Would you say that that’s the biggest 
beneﬁt of cultivating retention and 
employee loyalty? 
During Covid, we did not lay oﬀ or 
furlough a single employee due to 
Covid-19. At times, it was very 
stressful [around] how we were going 
to take care of our people and take 
care of our business, but we were able 
to do both. We continued to pay our 
people, every single one of them, 
during the pandemic while our stores 
were closed. What that allowed us to 
do was, when stores reopened, we had 
people already trained, ready to go 
and hitting the ground running. 
Coming out of Covid, retail got busy. 
There was a pent-up demand. So we 
weren't scrabbling, trying to hire 
people during a tight labour market.

What are Aritzia’s retail 
expansion ambitions?
Right now, we’re focused on the US. 
That’s where growth is coming from. 
We open 10 to 12 stores a year, and 
then I would say four to ﬁve 
repositions a year. That means we 
might have an existing store that we 
can possibly reposition in that same 
location or expand in terms of square 
footage. We’re opening in new 
markets. We’re opening more stores 
in existing markets. We have 57 
stores in the US now and we think 
that we can have close to 150 stores.

What do you think has been at the 
heart of Aritzia’s meteoric growth 
over the past couple of years?
Our product, our product innovation 
and our ability to get it right. Then 
there’s the store experience: the 
beautiful store design, the music we 
play, the cafes we have, the customer 
service we oﬀer. It’s the premier real 
estate locations that we have our 
stores in, and then it is the people we 
have in every single area of the 
business. 

It’s technology, it’s operations 
acumen, it’s our people practices in 
terms of recruitment and retention. 
It’s all of the support infrastructure, 
people, process and technology that 
we've been able to evolve as we've 
grown, but also made sure that we 
invested in the infrastructure. 

All those things are what 
diﬀerentiates Aritzia, and it’s not any 
one of those things, but it's all of these 
things that come together and how 
we’ve been able to execute well over 
the years on all of it. When I say we 
want to be excellent at everything, 
that's really what’s in our minds. It’s 
our mindset.

07. Marketplaces DisruptedFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 The “first wave” of online marketplace players 
have struggled to sustain share price growth

The “ﬁrst wave” of pure online marketplaces, or 
players that entered the market and captured 
signiﬁcant share before 2015, saw stock prices 
surge due to inﬂated valuations during the Covid-
19 pandemic when physical stores were closed. 
However, renewed interest in physical stores and 
shifts in the competitive landscape have led to 
sharp declines since 2021, with many trading 
below their 2018 levels.17

Specialised fashion players have been the most 
exposed to the turmoil in the sector. Others 
operating across categories, such as Zalando 
(which expanded into lifestyle), have been able to 
manage the ﬂuctuations of fashion demand better. 

A few years ago, investors prioritised sales growth 
in e-commerce, but with rising capital costs, they 
are now focusing on proﬁtability. Unproﬁtable 
businesses are no longer viable. The impact on 
struggling specialised fashion marketplaces is 
especially pronounced. Asos and Boohoo are 
among the UK’s most shorted stocks; Boohoo is 
facing shareholder pressure to break up the 
business and sell its top brands.18 19 20

07. Marketplaces DisruptedFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 In Europe, online fashion marketplaces will need to 
evolve their business models

In Europe, “ﬁrst wave” online fashion marketplaces are losing share to low-cost, 
high-growth players like Shein and Temu, as well as traditional retailers.9

Economic profit of European online fashion marketplaces, 
USD (millions)

According to the McKinsey Global Fashion Index, in 2023 online fashion 
marketplaces saw the largest value destruction since 2010, at $700 million. 
While this loss is expected to narrow, these companies are still struggling to 
evolve their business models. Four dynamics are expected to intensify in 2025:

• Prioritising proﬁtable orders: Zalando raised its average order value to 
€60.40 ($65.60) in the ﬁrst quarter of 2024, from €57.30 ($62.23) in 
2023, through premiumisation and expansion into sportswear. Asos 
introduced a refund deduction for customers with a higher return frequency 
and returns below a certain basket size threshold.22 23

• Exploring new value pools: About You and Zalando have expanded their 
business-to-business operations in search of higher margins, creating 
distinct identities from their business-to-customer propositions to oﬀer 
technology, marketing and logistics services to fashion brands.24 25

• Building scale and potentially impacting the marketplace-brand power 
balance: In luxury, Mytheresa acquired Yoox-Net-a-Porter in October 
2024. This trend is likely to accelerate in non-luxury segments. For 
instance, Frasers Group has grown its stakes in Asos, Boohoo and N 
Brown.26 27 28

Amazon Fashion accounted for

The primary online fashion marketplaces in the US include Amazon Fashion, 
Shein, Temu and large multi-brand retailers. Other fashion pure-players are 
smaller in scale and regionally concentrated.

Amazon Fashion leads the online fashion market in the US,  driving more than 
40 percent of total online fashion revenue in 2023.30 While Shein and Temu
pose a challenge (their monthly active users increased by 21 percent and 297 
percent in 2023, respectively), Amazon is defending its lead by launching a low-
cost marketplace for items under $20, offering delivery times of nine to 11 
days.31 32 33 Further potential developments could reinforce this value play:

• Lawmakers in the US are reviewing the de minimis threshold, which allows 
imports under $800 to be duty free. If removed, prices for around one third
of Shein and Temu products could rise by up to 20 percent.34

• Potential limitations with TikTok's reach in the US could impact Shein and 
Temu. The Temu hashtag had 11 billion views in early 2023 and Shein is the 
top fashion brand on TikTok Shop as of mid-2024.35 36 37

In the mid-market and premium segments, department stores are seizing their 
omnichannel advantage and launching online third-party marketplaces.38 
Fashion pure-players are strengthening their high-end portfolios: Revolve has 
acquired luxury label Alexandre Vauthier, for example.39 Amazon has also been 
solidifying its position in these segments with initiatives like the launch of 
Luxury Stores in 2020 and its investment in Saks Global in 2024.40

07. Marketplaces DisruptedFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 In China, managing social commerce proﬁtability 
and the blend of branded vs value products is key

Social and live commerce are crucial for engagement and conversion in online 
fashion shopping in China. Traditional shelf-based platforms such as Alibaba's 
Tmall and Taobao face stiﬀ competition from social platforms.41 42

Growth of monthly active users for major online platforms in fashion in China, 
June 2020 – June 2024,a
%

In the last 12 months, 44 percent of Chinese consumers shopped for fashion on 
social platforms. More than half say they shop on Douyin for apparel.43 Other 
rising platforms include value-focused Pinduoduo and the messaging platform 
WeChat, on which brands use mini-programmes and DTC brand accounts.44 45 
Given the proliferation of players, brands will need to balance distribution by:

• Managing the proﬁtability of social commerce with livestreamers: 81 
percent of consumers engaged in live commerce in 2023, and the market is 
projected to grow from 3 to 8 trillion RMB by 2026, with more traditional 
shelf-based players entering the space.46 47 However, as economic growth 
slows, promotional activities become more costly. Livestreamers charge 
high fees and earn based on gross merchandise value, forcing merchants to 
compete on price and absorb discounts. Impulsive buying from livestreams 
also leads to high return rates.48

• Balancing allocation of branded and value items: Alibaba, once focused 
on branded quality products, is adopting a low-price strategy, but it must 
balance Tmall’s branded oﬀerings with Taobao’s value products accessed 
via the same website, as branded sellers may be hesitant to list next to 
cheaper “dupes.” Meanwhile, Pinduoduo is looking to attract brands, which 
may be wary of the platform’s prior focus on unbranded and “outlet” items, 
as well as its cost-focused audience.49

07. Marketplaces DisruptedFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Five actions will support the longevity 
of ﬁrst-wave marketplaces

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

Make assortment a competitive 
advantage

Prioritise customer insights to curate an 
assortment that is diﬀerentiated from 
competitors, thereby becoming the 
destination of choice. Work together with 
brands on exclusive capsule collections, 
colourways or collaborations. 

Minimise complexity and unproductive SKUs 
to drive efficiency in the assortment. Balance 
the rationalisation eﬀort with maintaining 
sufficient breadth for scale. 

Maximise customer lifetime value

Create new avenues for profitability

Leverage owned marketing channels to drive 
traffic, invest in paid advertising to retarget 
existing customers, and personalise product 
recommendations and oﬀers to boost average 
order value and frequency.

Increase customer retention by clearly 
communicating loyalty benefits, such as early 
access to limited collections. Underpin this with 
top-tier customer service and customer 
relationship management technology.

Expand business-to-business services, such as 
oﬀering consumer data analytics based on 
website traffic, marketing placement services 
and fulfilment solutions.

Explore additional consumer revenue streams 
such as subscription models for delivery and 
financing oﬀerings.

Modernise the tech 
stack and talent

Leverage AI to reduce 
operating costs

Create a clear data analytics plan that 
maximises the benefits of new technology, 
turning tech into a business enabler rather 
than just a cost centre.

Build integration-ready, flexible IT 
infrastructure that can support new oﬀerings 
beyond the core business. Invest in top tech 
talent to deliver the implementation.

Drive cost efficiencies by deploying AI across 
use cases. For example, use AI to create product 
descriptions, sizing charts and fit guidance to 
reduce return rates; optimise the logistics 
network; and automate demand planning and 
inventory management.

Mytheresa: Staying Ahead 
e
in Luxury E-Commerce

  nto a 
CEO Michael Kliger has turned the German e-tailer into a 
leader in online luxury — and one of the few to remain 
  eal to 
proﬁtable amid a sector-wide slowdown. Ahead of a deal to 
rter, 
acquire one of its biggest competitors, Yoox-Net-a-Porter, 
 market 
Kliger anticipates a more stable luxury e-commerce market 
in 2025. 

BY MALIQUE MORRIS

Being a multi-brand luxury retailer online has never 
been harder. There are the high costs to acquire 
new customers, the ever-present problem of excess 
inventory and brands that prefer to sell on their own 
sites. A broader luxury slowdown has triggered a 
shakeout in the category, with Matches entering 
administration and Farfetch being acquired by 
Korean e-commerce giant Coupang in a fire sale.

Rather than attempting to compete on price or 
endless selection, survivors must prove they can 
offer shoppers an experience they can’t get 
elsewhere. Mytheresa has emerged as a leading 
example of how to do this successfully. The German 

e-tailer has generated profitable growth by focusing 
on driving sales from its top-spending customers.
Having hit on a winning formula, Mytheresa isn’t 
done innovating. Even as its old rivals are 
diminished, there’s always new e-commerce start-
ups jockeying to establish themselves. To remain 
competitive in the long term, online retailers have 
to go beyond serving a niche, even an especially 
lucrative one like the top one percent. They also 
have to balance increasing customer loyalty —
which helps grow profits — with a customer 
acquisition strategy that lets them widen their reach 
without losing money. That’s why Mytheresa is 
acquiring one of its primary competitors, Yoox-

Net-a-Porter, which carries more brands and has a 
larger customer base. (The deal is slated to close in 
2025 pending regulatory approval.)

But for the company’s chief executive, Michael 
Kliger, remaining resilient in luxury e-commerce 
goes beyond a play for consolidation. Kliger
anticipates a slow but steady recovery in 2025 and 
identifies ways to retain a strong position in tough 
times, including tapping new markets, selling more 
full-priced products and proving to consumers and 
brand partners why multi-brand retail is still 
valuable.

“It is possible to 
create a luxurious 
experience 
online, but it’s not 
a copycat of what 
the store can do. 
What we can do is 
understand what 
the customer 
wants from us.”

The luxury slowdown came 
swiftly this year and hit luxury 
e-commerce particularly hard, 
contributing to the situations at 
Matches and Farfetch. When you 
look ahead to the next several 
months, what do you expect for the 
luxury e-commerce sector?
Looking forward, I expect continued 
stabilisation for the sector overall.

We had a very tough time, but also 
that produced some healthy reactions 
in terms of reduction. [The industry] 
reduced the amount of stock in 
the market.

I don’t expect a V-shaped recovery, 
but I think stabilisation and continued 
progress. Nothing has changed for the 
rightful expectation that the share of 
digital luxury will continue to 
increase, and will deﬁnitely pass the 
30 percent threshold in the next 
couple of years.

The downturn in China — an 
important market for luxury — has 
been tough for a number of players. 
How is Mytheresa navigating the 
situation there?
My expectation for continued 
stabilisation is really driven by 
Europe and the US. China will, in my 
expectation, not get worse; it will 
stabilise, but not improve much. But 

that’s the time when you show that 
you’re committed to the market. 
That's the time we do events, that's 
the time when we introduce a Chinese 
version of our name [Mei Lin Shi], 
when we hire the new local 
president of [greater China, Dede 
Chan Brignoli].

Are there any markets where you see 
emerging growth opportunities in 
luxury e-commerce?
If you want to look for opportunities, 
there’s always three elements. One is 
you need economic growth. Second, 
a signiﬁcant part of our business is 
womenswear. You need a country, 
a culture, where women are 
participating in the workforce. 
Any society where people travel more, 
where more people join the 
workforce, in any of those countries 
we see the uptick of e-commerce, 
because then shopping is not so much 
an attractive pastime anymore. 
Then, the last factor is, of course, 
regulatory permits.

India ticks the box: middle class, 
aﬄuence, huge success story … more 
women joining the workforce. Some 
African markets already tick all those 
three boxes. In some African markets 
you have excellent technological 
infrastructure, which sometimes 
people overlook.

E-commerce is often thought of as 
a channel for consumers to research 
products and shop for convenience, 
while stores are where they go to 
enjoy a truly complete luxury 
experience. Is it possible to provide 
a true luxurious shopping 
experience being online only, and 
how do you go about doing that?
It is possible to create a luxurious 
experience online, but it’s not 
a copycat of what the store can do.

What we can do is understand what 
the customer wants from us, and the 
customer wants inspiration.

I have a great quote from a customer. 
She said, ‘I don’t have the luxury to 
waste time.’ Once the purchase has 
been decided, once the inspiration 
has succeeded, our luxury is it’s 
eﬃcient, it’s fast. Our luxury is you 
don’t have to worry, you don’t have 
to drive to town.

You have to deﬁne luxury in the way 
the customer wants it.

07. Marketplaces DisruptedFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 In-person events for top customers 
are one of Mytheresa’s primary 
sales drivers. But customer 
acquisition is still critical for online 
retailers to grow their businesses in 
the long term. How should luxury 
retailers balance catering to top 
clients with enticing new customers 
across income brackets?
We have a very clearly deﬁned target 
of a wardrobe builder that spends a 
lot. To acquire more of those types of 
customers, we have really ﬁne-tuned 
our digital marketing. The trick here 
is really to have powerful algorithms 
that give you predicted customer 
lifetime [value].

When we do our bigger events, we 
always give our clients a chance to 
bring a friend.

We are also hosting events with 
ambassadors … in their houses, we 
partner with them, which often 
involves donation to their charity of 
choice. Then they invite 50, 60 of 
their friends, and the social sphere of 
a very good customer is potential for 
new good customers. The crucial 
point here is we try to ﬁnd 
the customers again and again that ﬁt 
our model.

Many online shoppers ﬁnd products 
today not by going directly to a

social media and Google searches. 
When you do get a new customer

keep them coming back to your

lifetime value?

diﬀerent traﬃc than if you advertise for 
an $800 sneaker. These are all the 
choices you have to make to 
[determine] what type and quality of 
traﬃc you drive to your website.

Then it all depends how the ﬁrst 
purchase goes. We know that the 
satisfaction score on the ﬁrst purchase 

We try to generate good, high-quality 
traﬃc by where we advertise [and] with 
what we advertise. If you advertise for 
a $150 sneaker, and get clicks, you get 

was a big driver for loyalty, because if 
you don’t have a good satisfaction, you 
don’t get a chance for the second time.

97

Then as we enter the relationship, as 
we understand not only what they 
bought, but also what they looked at, 
then we can get better in providing 
relevant content in terms of product 
recommendations.

Clients which we acquired in 2015, 
that cohort, in terms of money, are 
still growing.

07. Marketplaces DisruptedFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 You’ve openly said that Mytheresa
beneﬁts from its competitors’ 
struggles. But there are also smaller 
luxury e-tailers that are doing well 
and aiming to reach Mytheresa’s
level. How do you plan to stay ahead 
of the competition and maintain 
your dominant position in 2025? 
I can imagine Yoox-Net-a-Porter 
will help with this.
There are many good e-tailers, 
smaller ones, who do a fantastic job 
in curation and positioning. We have 
big respect for those, and that also 
keeps us awake. We should be on 
our toes.

With the Net-a-Porter [and] Mr 
Porter brand, we can stay highly 
relevant without diluting proﬁles. I 
don't need to dilute Mytheresa or 
dilute Net-a-Porter. I make them 
both as strong as possible.

This is a very big exercise to integrate 
Net-a-Porter, Mr Porter, to have 
Yoox, again, on a dedicated platform 
that really serves their needs. That’s a 
big project. Mytheresa has proven 
that we are very good at big projects. 
We implemented our own technology. 
This was not done by outside 
consultants.

the task, but also high conﬁdence that 
we can do that.

The economy has forced retailers to 
ramp up discounting. Even if some 
companies are doing fewer 
markdowns, it’s still more frequent 
than before. How can luxury 
e-tailers convince aspirational 
shoppers to buy more full-priced 
merchandise even in a time of 
economic uncertainty?
We need to ensure that there's more 
than just price. We cannot take the 
price away. We cannot say, ‘No, you 
have to ignore price;’ it's impossible.

You need to overcome this by 
providing excellent service. Yes, you 
can get it there at 10 percent, but we 
have the full trust. If something 
happens, we are [here] for you. Are 
you sure the other shop will do that 
for you? Are you sure it’s the right 
product? You need to compensate for 
it.

Our strategy is not: they have minus-
10, then we have also minus-10. That 
just doesn’t make sense economically. 
So what additional emotional 
components can we do?

Operational excellence makes a 
diﬀerence, and I have big respect for 

Mytheresa is known for being 
proﬁtable in an industry where it can 
be diﬃcult to turn a proﬁt. Also, as a 

luxury retailer, customers expect a 
high level of service, from customer 
interactions to shipping, which 
comes with costs. How do you 
manage costs in a way that allows 
luxury e-commerce to be proﬁtable?
If you want to serve that [luxury] 
customer, that's not cheap. They 
expect a lot, and you have to give it.

Focus on full-price selling. A high 
share of full-price selling allows you to 
spend more. Focus on more valuable 
pieces. A beautifully packaged 
product costs you the same amount 
whether there's a $50 product in 
there or a $1,000 product in there.

The third most-important item to 
make a proﬁt is marketing cost. Make 
sure, to the best of your tools and 
algorithms, that you spend your 
marketing on valuable customers. 
If you spend a big amount of money 
but that customer is with you for the 
next ﬁve, six, 10 years, it was such a 
good deal.

For years now brands have been 
pulling back on their wholesale 
accounts to boost their direct-to-
consumer channels. What value can 
online multi-brand retailers oﬀer to 
shoppers and brands, and how can 
retailers retain brand partners in the 
long term?

98

The question we, as a retailer, have to 
answer [for brands] is: why should I 
share my margins?

Our hard push is we need to bring 
additional visibility; we need to bring 
additional customers; [and] we need 
to provide relevance.

If your only answer is, ‘Well, I bring 
you traﬃc,’ then your value-add is 
very thin.

Brands are more picky nowadays, 
because they have increased their 
retail eﬀort, they have improved their 
DTC. In many aspects, they are 
reaching more people than they were 
able to reach 10 years ago.
Wholesalers, retailers have to work 
harder.

08. Sportswear Showdown Challenger brands are forecast to generate over 
half of the sportswear segment’s economic proﬁt in 2024, up from 20 percent 
in 2020. This means the battle between challengers and incumbents in the 
growing sportswear market will likely intensify. To gain market share, brands 
will need to develop innovative products and use the right ambassadors and 
channels to activate unique brand stories.

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

•

In 2023, sportswear grew faster than the broader 
fashion market in key regions, by 2 to 3 percentage 
points (%points) in China, 5 to 6%points in the US and 
2 to 3%points in Europe.

• Fast-growing challenger brands are now expected to 
make up 57 percent of the sportswear segment’s 
economic profit, nearly tripling since 2020. 

•

Investors continue to be bullish on challenger 
sportswear brands, expecting their growth trajectory 
to be steeper than incumbents. Publicly traded 
challengers have seen significant share price gains 
from January through September 2024.

•

Invest in product innovations, both in core franchises 
and when expanding into new categories. Product 
remains king.

• Double down on product marketing to convey the 

benefits of the innovations. It has become even more 
important to deliver sharp messages on specific 
product novelties to customers.

• Build partnerships with ambassadors at both macro and 
micro levels. Secure emerging athletes early, leverage 
celebrities for brand storytelling and tap into local 
communities for authenticity.

• Develop a clear distribution strategy with direct-to-
consumer channels to drive engagement and 
storytelling, while strategically using retail channels to 
maximise reach and profitability.

08. Sportswear ShowdownFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Challenger brands will generate the majority of 
economic profit in sportswear in 2024

In 2024, challenger sportswear players — such as 
Deckers (owner of Hoka) and Asics — are expected 
to create over 50 percent of the segment’s value, 
surpassing incumbent sportswear brands known as 
the “Big Four” (Nike, Adidas, Puma and Under 
Armour) in economic proﬁt for the ﬁrst time, 
according to the McKinsey Global Fashion Index. 

Challengers have succeeded by growing revenue 
faster than incumbents while also expanding their 
proﬁtability. Challengers are expected to have 
grown revenues 18 percent per year between 2020 
and 2024E — 14 percentage points (%points) above 
incumbents — and improved proﬁtability by 
4%points over the period, while incumbents saw 
proﬁtability decline 2.4%points.1

Privately owned challengers are also seeing 
exceptional growth globally, including New 
Balance, Vuori and Alo Yoga.2

share by targeting niches and expanding reach

INNOVATION

TARGETING SPECIALISED 
CATEGORIES

TAPPING INTO CULTURAL 
MARKETING

FILLING WHOLESALE 
WHITESPACE

In recent years, incumbents have 
been excessively reliant on 
incremental improvements to their 
performance technologies. These 
innovations are often less 
noticeable and garner less 
consumer attention.3

On the other hand, challenger 
brands have reimagined running 
footwear with visible innovations 
that deliver both performance and 
recognisable diﬀerentiation. Hoka’s
oversized midsoles oﬀer unique 
cushioning and are easily 
identiﬁable, while On’s CloudTec® 
soles use a distinct, pod-like design 
to provide runners with support.3 4 5

While incumbents focused on a 
broader set of sports categories, 
many challengers tailored oﬀerings 
around smaller ones, targeting new 
customers and more niche sports.

Lululemon built its business to $6 
billion in 2021 by addressing the 
athleticwear gap for women, which 
incumbents had failed to conquer.6
Women’s sales represented less 
than 25 percent of Nike’s wholesale 
sales in ﬁscal 2023 and of Under 
Armour’s total sales in 2023.7 8 
Meanwhile, Arc’teryx and Salomon 
have delivered on ambitious growth 
plans by focusing on outdoor sport 
communities with marketing that 
enticed casual sneaker customers.9

Challengers borrowed from 
incumbents’ marketing playbooks, 
focusing on celebrities and culture. 
New Balance and Alo Yoga, for 
example, tapped high-proﬁle 
celebrities such as Jack Harlow 
and Kendall Jenner.10 11 While 
incumbents struggled with 
authenticity due to a wide fanbase, 
challengers conveyed greater 
authenticity with communities. 

Vuori and Gymshark focused on 
grassroots marketing, building ties 
with Southern California yogis and 
the English gym scene, respectively, 
while Hoka engaged running clubs 
and partnered with cultural platforms 
such as Hypebeast and End.12 13 14

In the late 2010s, incumbent 
brands such as Nike and Adidas 
began to actively shift distribution 
towards direct-to-consumer (DTC) 
channels, de-emphasising 
wholesale.15 16  

While incumbent brands moved 
away from some wholesale 
partners, challenger brands moved 
into highly visited retailers, like 
Dick’s Sporting Goods and JD 
Sports. Many challengers 
capitalised on the shift by pursuing 
wholesale-first strategies, driving 
65 to 70 percent of sales.17 18 19

102

08. Sportswear ShowdownFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 In 2025, sportswear is expected to continue 
to grow faster than fashion overall

In 2025, sportswear’s growth is expected to 
continue to outpace the broader fashion market in 
key regions, by 5 to 6 percentage points (%points) 
in China, 3%points in the US and 2 to 3%points in 
Europe.20

As much as 90 percent of sportswear companies 
are predicting either steady or increased sales in 
the year ahead.21 Key growth drivers include the 
increasingly blurred boundary between fashion 
and activewear, the prioritisation of health and 
wellbeing across age groups, and growing access 
to sports content and events:

• Two in three Millennial and Gen-Z customers 
wear athleisure multiple times per week.22

September 2024, Asics’ share price jumped 168 
percent, On’s rose 91 percent and Hoka-parent 
Deckers’ was up 38 percent.25

Meanwhile, incumbents have seen a more negative

08. Sportswear ShowdownFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 To win share, brands will diversify their oﬀerings, 
balancing reach and cultural credibility

Diversification is a common growth tactic and a core part of the 
incumbent playbook

However, challenger brands have also diversified in order to grow. In 
choosing how to diversify, brands must balance catering to sports that give 
them access to the largest customer bases (high participation rate), with 
those that drive the most cultural credibility (high number of fans following 
the sport). 

Performance and athleisure brands are going deeper into each 
other’s territories

For example, Alo Yoga, known for athleisure, yoga and training gear, 
launched its first performance-focused running shoe in 2024, while On is 
expanding into categories such as training and tennis, aiming to double its 
share of apparel sales in three to five years.29 30 31 Lululemon plans to double 
its men’s business by 2026 compared to 2021, focusing on performance 
sports such as golf and tennis.32

Material and product innovations are crucial for brands to build 
credibility in sports categories

Fewer breakthrough innovations have emerged in recent years, with patent 
grants dropping 55 percent between the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2023.33
While Nike has faced scrutiny about its innovation stream from retailers, it 
is the most active in terms of patents, filing the most patents (182) in the 
global sports industry in the fourth quarter of 2023.33 34

The sports sponsorship market is expected to grow 
from $63 billion in 2021 to $109 billion by 2030.35

Some athletes, especially younger stars, are opting 
to partner with smaller brands, as these contracts 
could oﬀer more control over their image.36 Despite 
lower rates, smaller brands have oﬀered athletes 
creative control or equity stakes, as seen between 
Holo Footwear and NBA player Isaac Okoro.37 This 
shift could encourage brands to oﬀer more ﬂexible 
deals to retain and attract talent.

Brands are recognising the long-term potential of 
emerging talent, supported by initiatives allowing 
college athletes to sign deals.38 New Balance signed 
Coco Gauﬀ six years ago and now she is one of the 
most marketable female athletes.39 In 2022, Nike 
signed WNBA player Caitlin Clark, the No.1 
WNBA draft in 2024.40 41

Looking ahead, challengers and incumbents will 
likely be more strategic about which celebrities they 
tap for partnerships, prioritising credible 
spokespeople over the ones who just have the 
largest followings.

In June 2024, Zendaya signed a multi-year 
collaboration with On, which the brand intended to 
drive meaningful storytelling around movement 
and wellbeing.42 

During the same month, Puma named K-pop star
Rosé, from the group Blackpink, as its long-term 
global ambassador. Rosé’s style aligns with Puma’s 
aesthetic, making her an ideal fit to redefine Puma’s 
classic products and head up the “Rewrite the 
Classics” programme.43 44

As sports and culture continue to converge, 
incumbents and challengers may focus more on 
connecting with local audiences by incorporating 
cultural elements into their marketing. 

During the 2024 Paris Olympics, New Balance 
collaborated with local artists such as Franck 
Pellegrino in its Marais store. New Balance also 
brought Joe Freshgoods’ “From Prom to Paris” 
project to life through personal art exhibitions.45

Adidas is reconnecting with Chinese youth through 
its “In China, for China” strategy. This includes 
localisation through partnerships with the China 
Literature and Art Foundation to promote sports 
culture through the “Century Masters” programme, 
which aims to reach 10,000 schools annually. 
Adidas has also teamed up with Chinese actor Chen 
Xiao to promote its initiatives across China.46 

106

08. Sportswear ShowdownFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Sportswear brands must strike the right balance 
between DTC and wholesale customer touchpoints

On and Hoka are planning to continue their expansion into direct-to-consumer 
(DTC).47 48 Nike and Adidas, meanwhile, are renewing part of their focus on 
wholesale after shifting heavily towards DTC and experiencing missed sales 
targets and rising inventory levels.49 50 51 52

DTC will be used for customer experience and community building: 
Adidas is launching its new premium outlet format, “The Pulse,” in the UK, 
designed for convenience and to easily adapt to high-demand products and new 
collections.53 54 Hoka opened its ﬁrst US ﬂagship in New York in June 2024, 
which will also serve as an events space.55

Wholesale will be used to increase reach and brand presence: Brands are 
expected to prioritise high-traﬃc retailers or culturally relevant partners, such 
as Dick’s Sporting Goods and End, and seek ways to integrate into their 
ecosystems, for example through oﬀering exclusive deals to loyalty members.56 
57 Lululemon, which does 90 percent of sales through its own channels, 
partnered with Zalando to expand its distribution in Europe.58

Competition for shelf space is growing: Sportswear retailers are elevating 
stores and expanding to attract more traﬃc, while reducing their reliance on 
single brands. Sports Direct is planning to open 10 new ﬂagship stores, while 
JD Sports acquired Finish Line and Hibbett in North America.59 60 61 Foot 
Locker is expanding its product range in response to shifting consumer 
preferences towards a broader selection of brands, in line with its 2023 “Lace 
Up Plan,” which includes an aspiration to reduce Nike's share of sales from 70 
percent in 2023 to around 55 to 60 percent by 2026.62

BY DANIEL-YAW MILLER

When thinking about challenger brands in the

brand On and Deckers-owned running label Hoka

put it firmly in a cluster of fast-growing brands 
collectively taking market share from the industry’s 
incumbents. In 2023, sales grew 23 percent versus 
the prior year to reach $6.5 billion. New Balance’s 
goal is to increase that figure to $10 billion in the 
next few years.

But while the brand has historically kept relatively 
quiet compared to bigger names such as Nike, 
Adidas and Puma, even remaining privately owned, 
a radical transformation over the past decade has 

To reach that target, president and chief executive 
officer Joe Preston, who joined the brand in 1995 
and took over the top job in 2018, doesn’t plan to 
change a thing. 

The brand’s aim in the year ahead is to stay on 
course and focus on what’s been working. That 
includes managing distribution to ensure it isn’t 
oversaturating the marketplace with any one style, 
maintaining close relationships with wholesale 
partners and retaining the company’s laser-focused 
approach to picking the right brand partners — not 
just the most famous ones — be they athletes like 
Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone or designers like 
Teddy Santis.

want to shop, where they want to shop 
and when they want to shop, then also 
being ﬁnely attuned to the trends that 
are taking place out there and making 
sure that we are delivering products 
and experiences that put us at the 
intersection between sport and 
fashion, between sport and music. 
That's where, we believe, is great 
energy.

New Balance is far older than many 
of its competitors. Do you think of 
yourselves as a challenger brand? 
Yes, we absolutely try to operate with 
that mindset. We are not as big as the 
two biggest players within the 
industry. [Therefore], we need to 
make sure we are operating in a way 
that’s true to who we are but also 
disruptive in a way that upstart 
brands, challenger brands, can be. 

Do you feel that being a private 
company has been helpful in that?
I deﬁnitely think in some areas it 
helps us. It allows us to take the 
longer view. A good example of that is 

US manufacturing. We’re the only 
athletic brand that has factories here 
in the US: two in Massachusetts, and 
up in Maine we have [three] factories 
up there. We’ve just added a new one 
in New Hampshire. All of our 
competitors — most of them are 
public — have tried to do this in the 
past and have given up. We believe, 
for us, that it provides a great way to 
drive innovation. We’ve opened up a 
new manufacturing R&D centre here 
in Boston, about a mile from our 
headquarters. 

Are there any other advantages 
to manufacturing some 
products domestically?
I think it absolutely helps us from a 
quality standpoint. We are making the 
shoes. [We’re] designing the 
processes that go into making those 
shoes and that in and of itself drives 
stronger quality with the product that 
we’re making with the contract 
manufacturers. I fundamentally 
believe that it’s a real strength of our 
company as a result.

How much emphasis do you place 
on innovation?
We’ve made two signiﬁcant 
investments: one on the 
manufacturing side, with the opening 
of a new manufacturing innovation 

centre; the second one is a product 
innovation centre that resides inside 
of our New Balance track, literally 
across the street from our global 
headquarters. That is all about 
delivering the best product to the best 
athletes in the world, who we’re 
working individually with. [We’re] 
also taking those insights and making 
sure we’re driving innovation for the 
everyday athlete. Then we also want 
to make sure we are being innovative 
all across our company. We’re trying 
to make sure that we are staying up to 
date, or ahead, in tech innovation that 
allows us to get closer to that 
consumer, allows us to spot trends 
earlier, [and] most importantly, to 
respond to those trends earlier in time 
to be meaningful.

How do you mine your archive 
to bring forward untapped retro 
products or innovative products 
based on retro designs?
We feel really fortunate [for] just the 
number of products that we have that 
were so grounded in innovation and 
performance at the time, so they’re 
really authentic. That allows us to 
bring them back to life in a manner 
that remains interesting through 
colour and material, but really trying 
to stay true to what that product was. 
Our design teams are constantly

08. Sportswear ShowdownFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025  
looking back at our catalogue to see
if there’s anything that would 
resonate with what’s happening in 
today’s environment. Some of those 
you see brought forward, and others 
are still there because the teams are 
waiting for a moment that aligns with 
some of the trends taking place 
around the globe.

Do you anticipate long-term 
interest in these retro styles?
I think authenticity is a really 
powerful element of a brand’s DNA. 
As younger consumers come into 
the category who are trying to 
understand a brand, where they 
came from, what made them be who 
they are, I think that’s always going 
to be important. Now it can ebb and 
ﬂow on what’s in style from a 
silhouette standpoint, but I think 
authenticity is a key. That’s a real 
diﬀerentiator that we have versus 
some of the other brands that are 
trying to challenge the two big 
brands.

How do you determine the right 
amount of product to put into the 
market while also wanting to 
maximise sales and not leave money 
on the table?

There’s an art and a science to it. 
There’s a math equation you can 
do, and you also have to have a feel 
for the market. That is a combination 
of being able to have strong analytical 
teams [and] have people on your 
teams that understand the 
marketplace. I think that experience 
that we have within our marketplace 
management, whether it comes 
from merchandising or within 
the ﬁeld, is a really important 
element. 

The sneaker market is more 
competitive today than ever 
before. How do you see this 
dynamic playing out? 
The marketplace has been disruptive 
for the past 15 years. For the ﬁrst 10 of 
those, it was primarily around retail 
and the shift from consumers 
shopping solely in stores to shopping 
more online. Within our sector, 
because of the price points and 
because of the hands-on nature of the 
product, it allows for the opening of 
stores by brands. I think that 
combination of us being a retailer 
and a great partner to our wholesalers 
is helping to fuel our rise because 
we’re able to present ourselves in 
the best way.

American rapper and New Balance ambassador Jack Harlow. New Balance. 

How do you strike the right balance 
between direct sales and wholesale?
We believe wholesale is a really 
important part of reaching the 
consumer. We pride ourselves on 
trying to be a good partner for our 
wholesale partners. We believe it’s an 
integral part of our growth and the 
health of our brand and the health of 
the industry. At the same time, we 
also know that our focus on DTC 
allows us to present the brand in the 
best way, and we believe that 
combination is very powerful.

This year has seen a big convergence 
between the sports and fashion 
industries. What’s New Balance’s 
approach now when evaluating 
who to partner with? 
The same as we approach any 
business relationship that we have: 
we’re looking for individuals or 
companies that we believe share the 
same values as we do. I think the one 
thing that separates us from our 
competitors with our relationship 
with these athletes, or with someone 
in the fashion world, is the bespoke 

approach that we take. Our goal is to 
be a premium sports brand, and we 
want to make sure we align ourselves 
with partners that feel the same way. 
Then we take an individualised 
approach to not just the product 
development but the execution and 
how that comes to life. I think that 
combination has proven to be 
successful for us.

09. Inventory Excellence Inventory remains a challenge for the industry 
with both excess stock and stocks-outs impacting brands. In 2025, margin 
pressures and sustainability regulation will place greater emphasis on 
end-to-end planning excellence, with brands increasingly adopting tech tools 
and adjusting their operating model to support agile supply chains.

KEY INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

• The fashion industry produced between an estimated 
2.5 billion and 5 billion items of excess stock in 2023, 
worth between $70 billion and $140 billion in sales.

• The average share of fashion brands’ assortments on 

discount increased 5 percentage points in the first half 
of 2024 compared to the year prior.

• The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation will 
require brands in the EU to report on the management 
of excess stock in 2025 and will make it illegal to 
destroy unsold products in 2026.

• Break down silos across the value chain, collaborating 
through fact-based root cause analysis and shifting 
the cultural mindset to foster cross-functional 
decision making.

•

Incentivise inventory excellence across teams by 
aligning organisational KPIs and shifting to a dynamic 
approach to inventory management.

• Leverage technology-enabled tools that marry data 

between retail functions and are closer to the realities 
of demand, involving suppliers where possible.

• Rapid trend cycles: The number of micro-trends has boomed, and 

trending styles ﬂuctuate in search volume by up to 300 percent in just 12 
months, making it hard for brands to predict demand.1 The number of 
videos tagged #fashion on TikTok has increased 2.5x in the past three 
years.2 Ultra-fast-fashion players such as Shein are also shortening speed-
to-market times to as little as 15 days.3

• Unpredictable seasonality: Climate change is making it harder to predict 
weather conditions and correlating demand. Temperature ﬂuctuations 
from the average make it diﬃcult for brands to sell through stock. While 
global temperatures for 2024 are higher than any other on record, summer 
2024 was the coldest in almost a decade in some European regions.4 5 

• Lengthy supply chains: The complex routing of fashion goods across 

retailers, brands and manufacturers results in long lead times with limited 
ﬂexibility. Similarly, the uptick in supply chain disruptions also poses a 
challenge for brands. Delays at the Suez Canal, for example, can extend lead 
times by 30 percent.6

• Product and channel complexity: Consumers are increasingly 

purchasing fashion items across a variety of channels, making it diﬃcult for 
brands to provide multiple options for size and colour across a growing 
number of touchpoints, especially if not operating a single stock pool. One 
example is social commerce, through which a ﬁfth of US customers have 
purchased clothing in the last 12 months.7

average loss in brands’ monthly 
profit due to inaccurate stock buying

Excess stock in the fashion industry was estimated 
to be worth between $70 billion and $140 billion in 
sales value in 2023.8

Stock-outs that span beyond a small proportion for 
brand-building purposes undoubtedly create 
missed revenue opportunities.

In 2024, despite overall industry inventory levels 
remaining broadly ﬂat, about one third of brands 
continued to struggle with inventory positions.8

Luxury inventories rose 2 percentage points 
(%points) in the ﬁrst half of 2024 compared to 
2023.8 LVMH and Kering recorded excess 
inventory of almost €5 billion ($5.4 billion) 
combined in 2023, with impaired inventory 
accounting for about 4 to 8 percent of total sales.9

Many brands resorted to proﬁt-diluting tactics like 
discounting. In the US, the average proportion of 
discounted fashion items in the ﬁrst half of 2024 
rose 5%points year on year.10 Nike said markdowns 
aﬀected around 44 percent of its assortment on 
average in 2024, compared to just 19 percent in 
2022.11

The root causes of stock-outs are more varied than 
ever and cut across functions, making them diﬃcult 
to identify and address. These range from on-time-
in-full issues due to vendor problems to inaccurate 
inventory forecasting.

Out-of-stock sizes ranks as the top complaint 
among shoppers. Inaccurate stock purchasing 
across sizes is estimated to result in proﬁt loss of up 
to 20 percent on average.12 For example, 
Lululemon attributed slower growth in the US in 
the ﬁrst quarter of 2024 in part to insuﬃcient 
inventory and stocks-outs in smaller women's 
sizes.13

09. Inventory Excellence Fashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Managing inventory is key for brands to achieve 
profitability and address new regulation

A focus on proﬁtability is pushing brands to optimise inventories

In 2025, brands will increasingly prioritise proﬁtability amid ﬂat sales volumes 
and increased markdowns. Given the strong correlation between inventory 
turnover and proﬁtability, tightly managing inventory will be one lever they can 
pull. Meanwhile, higher warehousing costs created by limited capacity and high 
interest rates are also pushing brands to shift unsold inventory: warehousing 
costs increased 10 percent in 2023 compared to the year prior.14

Recent sustainability regulations are adding pressure

While over-stocking has been the preferred option to maximise sales, there are 
further sustainability considerations that may impact this strategy in 2025, 
including regulation and self-imposed emissions targets.  

In July 2024, the EU approved the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products 
Regulation, which will require fashion companies in the EU to report on unsold 
textiles starting in 2025 and will make it illegal to destroy unsold products in 
early 2026.15

Similarly, in August 2024, California became the ﬁrst US state to approve the 
Extended Producer Responsibility programme for textiles, requiring apparel 
players to submit a plan for collection, repair and recycling of goods by July 
2030.16

With 60 percent of brands behind on sustainability targets, reducing over-
production and cutting waste through cost-eﬀective initiatives may place 
brands in the best position to achieve targets and maintain the bottom line.7

09. Inventory Excellence Fashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Fashion brands need to adopt proactive tactics to 
inventory management using tech-enabled tools

In search of a healthy bottom line and more sustainable business practices, 
companies are recognising the importance of a proactive approach to inventory 
optimisation: 

• Data-driven planning and forecasting tools: 75 percent of fashion 

executives plan to prioritise data-driven tooling.18 Brands are turning to 
advanced analytics platform providers such as o9, Nextail and Blue Yonder 
to automate processes from demand forecasting to allocation of inventory. 
These use cases have the potential to reduce inventory by 5 to 15 percent 
and to achieve a 15 to 25 percent improvement on stock-outs.19 Kering
reported a 20 percent improvement in the accuracy of its inventory 
forecasting with AI demand planning.9

• Dynamic open-to-buy adjustments: Increasing the share of in-season 

purchases helps brands control inventory levels. Other mechanisms such as 
“test and react” and “on demand” are also increasingly used by brands, 
enabling them to buy low quantities and test market reactions before 
reordering to reduce stock risk. In 2023, Asos announced its objective to 
scale “test and react” to 10 percent of its own-brand products.20

• Network optimisation: As supply chains become more complex, brands 

are looking to maximise eﬃciency in their network. Advanced analytics and 
digital twins can help model scenarios across channels. Hugo Boss plans to 
invest more than €150 million ($163 million) in digital intelligence by 2025 
and reported inventory-to-sales ratios down 3.4 percentage points in the 
second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period a year prior.21 22

09. Inventory Excellence Fashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Achieving sustained impact will require 
end-to-end collaboration across the value chain

Traditionally, merchandising, sourcing, logistics 
and supply functions used isolated solutions to 
address inventory challenges. This has led to lost 
value due to inefficient handovers, opaque 
processes and limited data sharing across teams 
and channels. 

Brands can no longer expect supply or store teams 
to resolve out-of-stock inventory. Instead, they 
must break down silos, collaborating and 
connecting decisions on assortment stock level 
across the value chain and through omnichannel 
optimisation. 

An end-to-end transformation is estimated to yield 
10 to 15 percent cost savings in retail, whilst 
implementing individual solutions across functions 
typically yields only 5 to 10 percent.23

Five levers to enable end-to-end planning collaboration

Align clear roles 
and responsibilities 

Revisit decision rights to empower buyers, 

planners and inventory managers to rationalise

119

09. Inventory Excellence Fashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Brands must reﬂect this change through an 
updated operating model and a mindset shift

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

Embed processes and a cultural 
mindset that breaks down silos

Widen accountability for 
inventory levels

Leverage technology-enabled tools

Collaborate across the value chain, instilling 
a partnership mentality, working from a single 
source of truth (known as a “platform 
approach”) and connecting decision making 
across functions. This will enable fact-based 
inventory interventions supported by central 
leaders with weekly meetings. 

Secure endorsement from senior leaders with 
influence across the organisation who can 
remove barriers to collaboration and set an 
example for the wider business to follow. 

Establish a cadence for fact-based problem 
solving to jointly resolve service and inventory 
issues, for example through nearshoring order 
allocation.

Align on organisation-wide goals, establishing 
inventory KPIs such as carrying cost, turnover, 
tracking and sell-through with accountability 
that is shared across the business and endorsed 
by leadership. Focus on return on investment 
rather than simply reducing costs.  

Endorse a mindset shift from a static (i.e. six- to 
nine-month lead) to dynamic buying approach 
that is always on and involves the whole 
business. Instil cultural confidence in data tools 
to inform decision making. 

Take a customer-centric approach to the use of 
generative AI, machine learning and advanced 
analytics tools to stay closer to the realities of 
demand and increase the accuracy of advanced 
planning and scheduling systems. 

Prioritise data transparency and marry the data 
between retail functions, integrating multiple 
systems. Understand and identify existing data 
handovers and potential translation issues 
between systems or teams.

Involve suppliers and be open to sharing 
insights and data with manufacturers to 
improve end-to-end visibility on early indicators 
of disruption.

Decarbonisation of fashion’s supply chain could cost 
$1 trillion, but it is likely more economically viable 
than executives think.1 Yet factors mask this reality: 

•

70 percent of fashion emissions occur upstream, 
yet suppliers struggle with the upfront costs of 
decarbonisation initiatives due to tight margins 
and high ﬁnancing costs.2

• Cost-eﬀective levers (e.g. energy eﬃciency) 

typically involve signiﬁcant collaboration and 
shifts in business operations that can leave 
suppliers exposed to risks such as slower lead 
times and adjustments to order volumes.

• Competing business priorities are often 

prioritised over sustainability initiatives that are 
comparatively diﬃcult to measure in terms of 
impact and return on investment. 

The fashion value chain spans thousands of players 
with limited integration. This restricts the impact of 
investment and makes charting an optimal, cost-
eﬀective path to decarbonisation inherently 
complex:

There is an “action-intention” gap when it comes to 
consumers and sustainable fashion. While 46 
percent of UK shoppers say they avoid buying fast 
fashion, more than half made a purchase at a fast-
fashion retailer in the past year.5

• There are over 300,000 fashion brands 

worldwide, each representing no more than 3 
percent of total industry sales.4

• Meanwhile, approximately 60 percent of global 
apparel production is conducted by small- and 
medium-sized suppliers, who may struggle with 
uncertain volume commitments, and competing 
sustainability initiative requests from brands. 
Similarly, they often lack the credit and 
guarantors to secure funding.3

• Consumers’ willingness to pay a premium for 
sustainable goods remains unclear. In the US 
and UK, for example, 61 percent of consumers 
rank price as a more important consideration 
than sustainability in fashion purchases.6

This places the onus on brands to actively engage 
and educate consumers to ignite demand for 
sustainable products. With the exception of a 
handful of brands, the industry has yet to unlock a 
marketable, at-scale value proposition for 
sustainable fashion.

Many fashion brands are scaling back their 
commitments, for example by pushing back or 
dropping their net zero targets.8

Suppliers are also deprioritising sustainability 
Over 40 suppliers have failed to meet commitments 
to set science-based sustainability targets, largely 
due to feasibility and high costs.9

can focus on cost-eﬀective decarbonisation 

Brands must consider swift action 

Brands can explore cost-eﬀective decarbonisation

By 2030, global apparel consumption is projected to rise by 63 percent to 102 
million tonnes. On this trajectory, by 2050 the apparel industry would 
represent more than one quarter of the world’s carbon budget.14 Similarly, 
regulation such as the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles 
signals a shift away from voluntary action, with potential ﬁnancial penalties for 
non-compliance. 

Brands must consider their role as value chain orchestrators, acting collectively 
to fast-track critical mass and scale while sharing costs and risks among 
players. 

Contrary to common perception, implementing sustainability levers can drive 
cost-eﬃciencies and up to 50 percent of tier-two emission abatement can be 
cost neutral.15

Brands can achieve dual savings across emissions and costs. For example, 
collaborating with suppliers on low-cost energy eﬃciency levers can oﬀset 
more expensive initiatives such as sustainable material innovation. 
Additionally, reducing waste and overproduction can be achieved through 
eﬀective inventory management. For more detail, see theme 09 Inventory 
Excellence.

10. The Sustainability CollectiveFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Long-term brand-supplier collaboration is an 
integral part of reducing industry emissions

Tier-two production, the stage in which fabrics are produced and treated, 
accounts for between 45 and 65 percent of fashion’s scope-three emissions.16
Yet 75 percent of fashion brands fail to involve suppliers in their sustainability 
initiatives.17 Driving decarbonisation is a long-term, complex process where the 
onus often falls on suppliers to fund and execute initiatives. While examples of 
collective action are emerging, more brands will need to participate to drive 
meaningful scale: 

H&M Group, Bestseller and CIP
H&M Group, Bestseller and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) 

announced plans to develop the first offshore wind project in Bangladesh to 
power manufacturers in the region with renewable energy. The project is 
forecast to cut emissions by around 725,000 tonnes annually and support the 
country in its goal of supplying 40 percent of the nation’s power through 

renewable sources by 2041.18

• Consolidate and partner on strategic commitments: Fashion brands 
can focus on fewer supplier relationships, consolidating sourcing to reach 
critical mass. Doing so helps brands inﬂuence and support their suppliers’ 
sustainability and operational improvements. Brands should focus on their 
top 60 to 80 percent of supplier volumes, either in core or high-volume 
categories. 

• Embrace long-term commitments to suppliers: To justify the upfront 

implementation cost and complexity of sustainable practices, brands should 
enter long-term strategic commitments with suppliers through volume 
oﬀtakes, lead-time extensions and short-term price premiums. 

• Collectively address industry bottlenecks: Brands can play an active 
role in reducing implementation barriers, such as engaging ﬁnancial 
institutions to provide suppliers with interest-free loans or discounting 
future orders. Similarly, brands can collaborate with suppliers and policy 
makers to identify high-priority levers and educate suppliers on best 
practices related to energy eﬃciency, eﬀective planning and partner 
collaboration. 

Future Supplier Initiative
The Future Supplier Initiative, announced in June 2024, aims to bring down the 

cost of financing for decarbonisation projects by having brands help 
underwrite the debt their suppliers take on. This is facilitated by the Fashion 
Pact, in partnership with Apparel Impact Institute, Guidehouse and DBS Bank. 
The initiative aims to match projects with the highest potential for impact, 

identifying common factory units, interventions and costs, to enable a global 
and regional joint effort between fashion brands.19

PVH Corp.
PVH Corp. teamed up with Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC Bank USA to 
create a new financing programme for suppliers that exceed PVH’s Human 
Rights and Environmental Supply Chain standards, oﬀering favourable trade 
finance options and discounted financing to incentivise sustainability 
projects.20 21

10. The Sustainability CollectiveFashion SystemThe State of Fashion 2025 Brands can create favourable conditions for 
sustainable-material innovators to scale

In recent years, several sustainable-material start-ups have emerged, 
demonstrating transformative technologies and clear value propositions. But 
few have succeeded in reaching scale and signiﬁcantly reducing fashion’s use of 
emissions-intensive materials.

Brands must de-risk the commercial prospects for new business building. 
Those that do so will not only accelerate emission abatement but also secure 
early-mover advantage through access to sustainable materials at lower prices 
than peers: 

H&M Group and Syre
H&M Group and Vargas Holding launched Syre, a new venture to scale textile-
to-textile polyester recycling in March 2024.22 Syre is backed by private equity 
and venture capital firms TPG Rise Climate, Giant Ventures and Norrsken, and 
closed a $100 million Series A funding round in May 2024.23
H&M secured an oﬀ-take agreement with Syre worth $600 million over a seven-

year period, covering a significant share of H&M’s long-term need for recycled 
polyester. The objective of this agreement is to rapidly scale the technology. 
Meanwhile, Syre announced plans to open two large recycling plants in Iberia 
and Vietnam as part of a broader plan to have 12 production plants at full speed 

• Place fewer, bolder investments: Brands should take a more focused 

worldwide by 2032.23

Inditex and Ambercycle
As part of its effort to reach 25 percent next-gen materials by 2030, Inditex 
announced a three-year partnership with Ambercycle to help scale its textile-
to-textile recycled polyester. The partnership, announced in 2023, includes a 
purchase commitment whereby Inditex will purchase 70 percent of 
Ambercycle’s production, supporting the company to scale and construct its 
first commercial factory, which is expected to start production in 2025.24 25 26

approach to backing material innovation, making larger investments that 
provide start-ups with the capital to scale operations and meet the 
capacities required for an industry transition. 

• De-risk the commercials: To provide start-ups with the runway needed to 

scale and become cost-competitive, brands can oﬀer funding options 
directly, through debt ﬁnancing for example, or indirectly, signalling clear 
demand through oﬀ-take agreements and multi-year arrangements.

• Build material-innovation muscle: Brands must develop an in-house 
understanding of the technicalities and economics of adopting new 
materials. To do so, they must adjust business processes such as absorbing 
short-term increases in material costs and managing volumes through 
phased introduction.

working with the broader fashion ecosystem

EXECUTIVE PRIORITIES

Commit to sustainability initiatives 

Rethink long-term supplier contracts

Get granular on data 

Adopt a “dual mission” addressing 
profitability and sustainability together while 
collaborating with stakeholders to commit to 
emission abatement initiatives. Brands and 
manufacturers can cost-effectively reduce 
their emissions through joint investments. 

Shift towards an action-oriented, collective 
model, sharing best practices on supplier 
decarbonisation and financing solutions that 
can meaningfully scale initiatives and reduce 
financial risk. 

Commit to commercialisation — the stage 
between development and widespread 
availability. This helps solutions avoid getting 
stuck sub-scale, while also capturing first-
mover advantage and maximising potential. 

Embed new processes for supplier sourcing, 
creating a collaborative model for working with 
tier-two suppliers. 

Ensure adherence to decarbonisation plans 
through aligned incentives and commercial 
contracts. Use marginal abatement cost curves 
(see page 125) to identify and prioritise 
sustainable initiatives in conjunction with 
suppliers. 

Consolidate suppliers to achieve critical mass 
without becoming overly reliant on any single 
supplier. Brands should independently select 
tier-one suppliers and work with suppliers to set 
stricter sustainability criteria for tier-two 
contracting with tier-one suppliers. 

Partner with leading traceability and impact 
measurement providers and collaborate more 
closely with suppliers on data transparency. To 
set targets, suppliers need detailed data on their 
carbon emissions. Securing this data requires 
time, technology and know-how.

Map the entire value chain — including tier-three 
suppliers, the first stage in the value chain that 
deals with raw material processing — to improve 
data visibility and quality. This work is critical for 
setting more attainable sustainability targets, 
prioritising and sequencing decarbonisation 
initiatives and measuring their impact.

McKinsey Global Fashion Index The industry’s economic profit continues to 
achieve record heights. However, market dynamics are changing. Whereas luxury
players once led in value creation, non-luxury players are catching up. These 
shifts have made the gap between top- and bottom-performers the smallest it has 
been since 2011.

KEY INSIGHTS

• Economic profit (EP) grew 16 percent from 2022 to 2023 
and is expected to reach record-high levels in 2024. That 
said, the 5 percent growth expected in 2024 is lower 
than the growth seen in 2023.

• While the luxury segment drove value creation in recent 
years, in 2024 EP for the segment is expected to fall for 
the first time since 2016 (excluding Covid-19) due to 
lower demand creating margin pressure.

• Following the shift in segment dynamics in 2023, in 2024 
non-luxury is expected to generate more EP than any 
other segment since 2010 (excluding Covid-19) driven by 
efficient operations and customers trading down, with a 
30-index point increase from 2023.

• Luxury margins are expected to drop 2 percentage points 
(%points) in 2024, while premium/bridge and mid-market 
segments are forecast to generate record-high margins.

•

In the non-luxury segment, sportswear and mall brands 
show exceptional profitability and revenue growth, while 
pure online marketplaces are narrowing their EP losses.

• Between 2022 and 2024, the top 20 percent of players are 
expected to lose 13%points in value, while the bottom 20 
percent gain 13%points, closing the gap between players.

• Luxury leads the Super Winners list, based on 

performance in the last full year. New entrants include 
Deckers, Mexican department store operator El Puerto de 
Liverpool and Moncler. Further reshuffling is expected by 
the end of 2024.

McKinsey Global Fashion IndexThe State of Fashion 2025 The industry is expected to post record economic 
proﬁt in 2024

The McKinsey Global Fashion Index (MGFI) uses 
data from 400 public companies to track the fashion 
industry’s most important segments, product 
categories and markets. It measures ﬁnancial 
growth and value creation through economic proﬁt 
(EP), calculated as the diﬀerence between a 
company's adjusted operating proﬁt (minus taxes) 
and its cost of capital. EP also reﬂects value created 
over time, allowing the index to gauge how much a 
company invests to generate its results. 

In recent years, companies have shifted their focus 
from topline growth to proﬁtability, leading to 
signiﬁcant margin improvements. As EP is highly 
sensitive to margin gains, which are twice as 
important as capital turns in shaping the EP 
trajectory, these margin improvements have 
resulted in disproportionate value creation.

In 2023, a 0.5 percentage point (%point) margin 
improvement and 4 percent revenue growth led to a 
16 percent EP increase for the industry. The trend is 
expected to continue in 2024, with EP estimated to 
grow 5 percent, driven by a 0.2%point margin boost 
and 3 percent revenue growth. Additionally, given 
the improved capital intensity compared to 2019, EP 
is expected to stabilise at 2.8x pre-Covid levels.

McKinsey Global Fashion IndexThe State of Fashion 2025 However, record-high EP is not enough to allay 
investor uncertainty which drives lower valuations

Proﬁtability improvements that have driven record-
high EP in the fashion industry have met investor 
expectations. However, the share of the valuation 
driven by future proﬁt expectations has fallen, 
shedding light on investor uncertainty about the 
industry’s future value creation opportunities.

To regain investor conﬁdence, companies will need 
to create compelling strategies and brand narratives 
aligned with achieving sustainable growth.

Luxury has already started to show signs of this. 
After peaking in 2020, luxury enterprise value is 
trading slightly higher in 2024 than 2022 (with an 
enterprise value to EBITA ratio of 19.2 vs 18.0 in 
2022),d due to current slower growth and 
anticipated future value. Non-luxury valuations 
continue to decline, reaching the lowest multiples 
since 2012 (15.9 in 2024 vs 16.8 in 2022).

McKinsey Global Fashion IndexThe State of Fashion 2025 The non-luxury segment is expected to buoy EP, 
marking a shift in industry dynamics

Between 2021 and 2022, luxury alone contributed 
to the fashion industry’s growth in economic profit. 
The segment achieved this growth in part due to 
price increases. Other segments dragged industry 
EP down. 

In 2023, this dynamic began to change. Non-luxury 
drove the lion’s share of value creation, while luxury 
only accounted for 11 points out of the total 33-
point increase in the industry’s EP index.

This shift is expected to continue in 2024. Luxury is 
expected to create less value than the previous year 
for the first time since 2016 (excluding Covid-19). 
Meanwhile, non-luxury is expected to contribute 
more value — an expected 30-index point increase 
in economic profit — than any segment since 2010 
(excluding Covid-19).

McKinsey Global Fashion IndexThe State of Fashion 2025 Consumer downtrading is driving non-luxury,
while pricing and demand is challenging luxury

After years of raising prices, luxury players can no 
longer pull this lever without negatively impacting 
demand. Some players have opted for more 
promotions, which has compressed their margins. 
Overall, the segment also saw one of its key growth 
engines, mainland China, sputter, as consumer 
conﬁdence in the region has dropped. 

Fashion customers consistently adopt cost-
conscious shopping behaviours, with 64 percent of 
US shoppers trading down in the third quarter of 
2024. Over 70 percent of customers plan to 
purchase from outlets or oﬀ-price retailers in the 
next 12 months, even if their discretionary budget 
increased, according to the BoF-McKinsey State of 
Fashion 2025 Consumer Survey. 

As non-luxury companies continue to focus on cost 
cutting and operational gains, proﬁtability is 
expected to improve, particularly in the mid-market.

luxury margins, while luxury margins declined

Luxury segment EBITA margins are expected to 
fall by 2 percentage points between 2023 and 2024. 
However, margins are expected to remain higher than 
other segments.

A focus on profitability has led non-luxury players 
to reduce costs and streamline inventories. This has 
allowed the premium/bridge and mid-market 
segments to reach record-high margins in 2023, 
with more growth expected in 2024.

Inditex reduced its inventory by 7 percent in 
January 2024 compared to 2023, driven by 
robust operating performance and

• Levi Strauss & Co. identified $100 million in 
cost savings for 2024 from its productivity 
initiative “Project Fuel,” focused on optimising 
the operating model and business processes.2

• Zalando grew its margins to 6.5 percent in the

more EP in 2024, driven by revenue gains

In 2024, the luxury segment started to navigate 
challenges and uncertainties as the post-pandemic 
spending surge slowed. 

Companies responsible for 77 percent of the 
segment’s economic profit are projected to 
experience negative EP growth from 2023 to 2024, 
due to plateauing revenues and reduced EBITA 
margins for some of the groups’ brands. 

The companies responsible for the other 23 percent 
of segment profit will see positive EP growth, 
though this growth is only 7 percent year on year, 
not nearly enough to offset the segment’s EP losses. 
This smaller group is growing EP by increasing 
revenues, but margins remain flat. Because EP is 
more sensitive to margin improvements than 
revenue growth, this means overall EP growth will 
be modest.

distributed across the segment

In 2024, the premium/bridge, mid-market and value/discount segments are 
expected to dial up value creation by focusing on proﬁtability. As consumers 
continue to trade down, these players’ revenues are expected to increase as 
well.

Segment “Super Winners” such as Inditex, Fast Retailing and TJX have seen
continuous EP growth for the last ﬁve years and are expected to continue 
driving a large share of EP. However, other players in the segment are also 
expected to improve their performance, contributing to more evenly 
distributed value creation across the segment:

• Mall Brands such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle and Gap are 
starting to see the outcome of their transformation eﬀorts, which are 
expected to positively impact their EP trajectory in 2024. 

• Sportswear challengers such as Hoka (owned by Deckers) and Salomon 
(owned by Amer Sports) are outperforming incumbents such as Nike and 
Adidas in EP and are expected to account for more than half of the 
sportswear segment’s EP for the ﬁrst time in 2024.

• Pure online marketplaces have faced market disruptions and experienced 
their largest value loss since 2010, with $700 million destroyed in 2023. 
However, a focus on proﬁtability has started to show early improvements in 
EP growth, with the destroyed value expected to decrease to $400 million 
in 2024.a

After facing Covid-19 store closures and 
competition, surviving mall brands have undergone 
brand transformations in a bid to generate robust 
proﬁtability. Their performance in the last year has 
sparked investor conﬁdence. From January 2023 to

top 50 brands by average total shareholder return 
out of approximately 400 publicly listed companies 
in the fashion value segment.

McKinsey Global Fashion IndexThe State of Fashion 2025 Luxury tops the Super Winners list, while 
sportswear and department stores shift places

The latest full-year 2023 list of Super Winners 
shows that luxury players drove most of the 
economic proﬁt (EP) in 2023. LVMH drove just as 
much EP as the next two players combined. A 
reshuﬄing among sportswear brands and 
department stores brought new entrants to the list 
while ousting others.

•

•

In the luxury segment, Moncler entered the list 
for the ﬁrst time. LVMH hit record EP levels in 
2023 and represented 22 percent of the 
industry’s total value. 

In sportswear, Deckers, parent of challenger 
brand Hoka, made its debut, while Nike and 
Lululemon dropped by one place each. JD Sports 
fell out of the top 20 for the ﬁrst time since 2019.

• US department store Dillard’s dropped four 
spots and Macy’s fell oﬀ the list. Meanwhile, 
Mexican department store El Puerto de 
Liverpool entered the list, becoming the ﬁrst-
ever Latin American company to be featured.

In 2024, further reshuﬄing is expected as premium 
and mid-market brands gain traction, sportswear 
challengers keep growing and dominant luxury 
players continue to struggle.

L Catterton: Finding Value 
in a Tough Market

Nikhil Thukral, managing partner at the 
LVMH-affiliated private equity fund, talks 
about the ingredients of winning companies, 
the dynamics challenging fashion’s 
incumbents and how economic shifts 
are shaping investor strategies.

BY MARC BAIN

How consumers spend their money is a topic Nikhil 
Thukral and L Catterton watch closely. 

any economic ups and downs and swings in the 
market. 

The large, consumer-focused private equity fund, 
which has close ties to LVMH and where Thukral
serves as managing partner, regularly tracks nearly 
100,000 shoppers online as well as data such as 
brand awareness and loyalty metrics to determine 
how well its portfolio companies and their 
competitors are resonating with shoppers. The 
information helps L Catterton understand whether 
customers will keep returning to a brand, despite 

What the ﬁrm is looking for is long-term value. 
Among the fashion names in L Catterton’s 
expansive stable, which ranges from hospitality to 
consumer-packaged goods, are Birkenstock, which 
went public in 2023, and fast-growing labels such 
as Ganni. To Thukral, value doesn’t just mean 
brands with top-line growth but also a clear 
identity and pricing power that can drive 
margins and proﬁtability. 

These qualities are set to play a major role in 
separating leading companies from laggards in 
2025, perhaps especially in luxury, where a 
slowdown is weighing on the sector. At the same 
time, competition outside of luxury is only growing 
ﬁercer as categories such as sportswear see a rise in 
challenger brands putting pressure on incumbents. 
With central banks once again cutting interest 
rates, investors will have opportunities — if they 
know where to look.

“For millennia, 
people have 
thought about 
their place in 
society based on 
what high-badge 
products do in 
terms of 
conferring that. 
The basic need 
we don’t think 
goes away.”

Over the past few years, we’ve seen 
changes in what investors prioritise 
in companies. Proﬁtability has 
become more important, for 
example. What will brands need to 
prove to investors in 2025 to win 
their backing?
I will tell you our perspective: First 
and foremost, it’s not that you need to 
be proﬁtable, it's that you need to 
have a very strong proﬁt formula in 
the business. We look at that in terms 
of gross margin. You need to be able 
to understand ‘why does the business 
command that gross margin and can it 
continue to do that?’ In other words, 
does the brand have pricing power, 
and if so, why and how. 

The opposite is the watchout. How 
much of the brand proposition is sold 
on discount? Through what outlets 
are you selling it? As an investor, it's 
not just looking at proﬁtability and 
EBITDA. It’s looking at the 
resonance of this brand.

What characterises winning fashion 
companies?
‘Fashion’ is a loaded term, because it 
can imply a degree of following 
trends, and trends can be very diﬃcult 
to call. What wins in fashion in 
particular is a clear understanding of 
your consumer, who you’re targeting 
and why you’re targeting them, where 

you ﬁt into their world and what [you 
are] oﬀering them.

don’t think goes away. 

Second, the ability to be able to deﬁne 
and be true to your DNA. There are 
great brands in fashion who are 
building a beautiful product, but that 
product isn’t necessarily tied into the 
DNA of the brand, so consumers have 
a diﬃcult time identifying how this ﬁts 
in with what you are about.

Luxury had been fashion’s big value 
creator, but it slipped this year. Do 
you believe that’s purely due to 
macroeconomic factors, or is the 
consumer’s view of luxury changing?
Depending on which cohort, there 
may be an indexing of spend that goes 
more towards experiences rather than 
product. In other 
cases, the dynamic is diﬀerent. 
China is going through its ﬁrst 
period of [its growth rate] and 
demand decreasing. As that’s 
happening, the Chinese consumer is 
doing exactly what every other 
consumer does — they think about 
their balance sheet, and they are 
deferring whatever they can.
At the end of the day, luxury has a 
fundamental place in existence. For 
millennia, people have thought about 
their place in society based on what 
high-badge products do in terms of 
conferring that. The basic need we 

In sportswear we’ve seen the rise of 
challenger brands successfully 
chipping away at the dominance of 
incumbents. Is that unique to 
sportswear, or is that something you 
see happening in other categories?
You see it happening in other 
categories as well. In my opinion, it’s 
lent itself well to sportswear because 
there’s so much usage and the 
category was rising, so it's not atypical 
that, when you have that happen and 
you’ve got a few concentrated players, 
you’ll have new propositions arise, 
because the juice is worth the 
squeeze. There’s a market 
opportunity. In other categories 
where you haven't seen that happen, 
it’s more because, rightly, people are 
asking, ‘Is the eﬀort worth it? Is there 
enough tailwind in those 
subcategories?’ If we were to look 
across other spaces, luxury and 
non-luxury, certainly at beauty 
and personal care, you’ll see 
similar trends.

Do you have a sense of what’s 
allowing challenger brands to 
compete against the incumbents?
Today, cohorts of consumers are 
consuming media from such 
fractionalised sources that you’ve got 
these tribes that emerge, and we live

143

McKinsey Global Fashion IndexThe State of Fashion 2025  
in a world where technology has 
enabled brands to find and activate 
these tribes in a cost-efficient fashion, 
in digital in particular. So you can 
build a brand cost-effectively, there’s 
a virality to the brand because you’ve 
got endorsements from existing 
customers and you can expand the 
brand to a level amongst these tribes 
in ways you couldn’t before. What On 
has done against Nike in that space is 
a good example. It still has relatively 
low awareness but very strong 
traction amongst a particular 
consumer [demographic].

With banks now cutting interest 
rates, how do you expect that will 
change investor strategies?
Any time there are rate movements, 
it has the propensity to create 
a mispricing of risk. Sometimes a rise 
in rates can create opportunity, 
because businesses that otherwise are 
sound businesses end up becoming 
under-priced relative to their long-
term potential. The converse is also 
true. As rates come down, the biggest 
risk we see is a tendency to paint 

everything with the same brush. 
Separating what's truly unique and 
differentiated from what is otherwise 
a rising tide and category, that's 
where the science comes in. We 
would look at this rate environment 
and say, generally, that's going to be 
good for investment. The watchout is 
you've got to be able to separate the 
wheat from the chaff. 

Do you think we’ll ever go back to 
the days of valuations like we saw 
with, say, Allbirds again, or are 
those days over?
I think the nature of what drove 
valuations is different. You were 
talking about a cohort, many of 
them going public with growth but 
not a business model or inherent 
profit formula that was enduring. 
Those days are gone. I think what 
it’s going to turn to is, ‘Okay, what’s 
the nature of the business? What 
kind of profitability do you have? 
And can we believe that profitability 
is going to be sustainable?’ That’s, 
I think, where we see value 
move towards.

On advert. On.

144

McKinsey Global Fashion IndexThe State of Fashion 2025  
Given the current market 
environment and the backlog of 
overdue exits, how do you see exit 
strategies playing out in the year 
ahead?
 It’s dynamic. On the positive side, 
there is a much more rational set of 
expectations between buyers and 
sellers now than three, four years ago. 
If you're a seller, you've been through 
some existential risk, including the 
pandemic, and maybe the world that 
you had and the valuations you had 
will never come back. You’re more 
inclined to say, ‘We should de-risk, 
when we can, at something 
reasonable.’ That allows you to be 
able to transact between buyer and 
seller.

We also see more strategic activity. 
For the right brands, there will always 
be interest. In time, you will see 
ﬁnancial sponsors come back into this 
category as well. There needs to be 
more category health, more 
predictable demand and you need to 
have more market participants here. 
But it will come back.

When you look to 2025, what are 
the big themes in consumer 
behaviour shaping the ﬁrm's 
investment strategy?
You have to know which segment, 

that were monolithic around trying to 
scale in digital and single-channel, 
increasingly we're seeing the need for 
distribution, omnichannel growth and 
development. Wholesalers are great 
partners and distributors. They help 
build awareness. They valorise your 
brand for you. We’re coming back 
again to that world. There are parts of 
luxury that haven't needed to do that, 
because they already control the 
distribution. But we think for younger 
brands, as they grow and scale, 
particularly in luxury, you're going to 
need to get comfortable having a 
broader channel strategy.

“All cohorts of 
consumers, both 
older and 
younger, are 
increasingly 
valuing 
experiences over 
traditional asset 
accumulation.”

which price band, are you talking 
about, because they behave quite 
diﬀerently. We tend to focus on the 
top 30 to 40 percent of US 
households. That’s where the 
disposable income is created. You 
contrast that with Asia, where you've 
got a rising middle class powering the 
consumer economy. 

We will also continue to think very 
carefully around ‘who is the 
consumer, where does this brand ﬁt 
in, what's the emotional connection 
the brand has?’ We're looking for 
things that are more than just 
functional in terms of why consumers 
buy. Everything has got to be 
supported by some sort of secular 
growth driver. We're not trying to 
time the economic cycle.

Are there any trends or shifts you 
think are under-appreciated by 
the market?
All cohorts of consumers, both older 
and younger, are increasingly valuing 
experiences over traditional asset 
accumulation. This is particularly true 
for the luxury consumer. We think 
about luxury travel, we've seen a lot of 
secular growth in those categories. 

Two, I think as you're building brands 
today, the days of business models
