Executive summary

The past two years have been the best for banking 
since before the global financial crisis (GFC) of 
2007–09, with healthy profitability, capital, and 
liquidity. But even though banking is the single 
largest profit-generating sector in the world, the 
market is skeptical of long-term value creation  
and ranks banking dead last among sectors on 
price-to-book multiples. 

In addition to a mix of macroeconomic factors, there 
are also some industry-specific ones: 

 — Labor productivity growth in banking has been 
mixed, even though banks spend the highest 
proportion of revenues across sectors on tech. 

 — Regulatory changes around the world continue 

to require investment.

 — The more profitable pools in banking are 
witnessing competition from focused  
attackers (including private credit, payments, 
and wealth management).

 — The recent lift in performance has largely been 

buoyed by rising interest rates. 

 — Despite the recent value creation, over the past 
decade, the sector has eroded economic value 
when measured against cost of capital.

So will the liftoff in overall industry results achieved 
in 2023 give way to the gravitational pull of  
the industry’s recent history, as questions about 
banking fundamentals persist?

Looking at banks that outperformed over the past 
five to ten years could hold the answer to how banks 
might achieve escape velocity. We identified these 
winners through multiple analytical lenses. What we 
found is that they win through a combination of 
smart moves on three structural dimensions (selecting 
segments carefully, finding scale where it can 
matter, and strategically locating themselves, 
whether geographically or in the value chain) and 
rigorous operational execution across a range  
of capabilities (for example, analytics, marketing 
effectiveness, operating model, and tech). For some 
contexts where we modeled the relative effects, 
execution had two times the impact of structure, 
though both were important. No bank we found 
among the winners appeared to be outperforming 
with only an average structural context nor being 
propelled solely by its structural position. 

The good news for the rest of the industry is that 
things can be improved. Indeed, about 10 percent of 
the industry improved as much as five deciles of 
return on tangible equity over the past five years 
(though conversely, roughly two-thirds of the industry 
stayed within two deciles of their prior performance). 
For banking to recover its multiple, management 
teams will need to conjure the dynamism of these 
winners. We believe this “management quotient” will 
be what makes the real difference in the remaining 
years of the 2020s.

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocityThe industry

Everything is going to be fine in the end. If it’s not fine, it’s not the end.
—Unknown (often attributed to Oscar Wilde)

There’s some solace in the witticism about it not 
being the end if it’s not fine. But recently, things 
have been fine indeed for banking, so what does 
that say about the endgame? In fact, the past  
two years have been the best for banking since 
before the Great Recession. Globally, banks 
generated $7 trillion in revenue (Exhibit 1) and  
$1.1 trillion in net income, with return on  

tangible equity (ROTE) reaching 11.7 percent  
(Exhibit 2). Banks have returned to healthy levels  
of capital (12.8 percent common equity tier one 
capital divided by risk-weighted assets) and liquidity 
(77.2 percent), which both improved over 2022. In 
fact, banking generated more total profit than any 
other sector around the world (Exhibit 3).

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocitySo why the foreboding? Simply, global banking is 
valued at a price-to-book ratio of 0.9—the lowest of 
all industries—which suggests the market is 
expecting the industry will erode economic value  
as a whole (Exhibit 4). And this challenge exists 
across most markets (Exhibit 5). There are many 
potential reasons for it:

 — The improvement in returns could be fleeting. 
Looking back, while the industry has reduced 
costs and kept credit quality high, the 
improvement in returns since 2021 appears  
to be largely owed to rising interest rates  
(Exhibit 6). Modeling, while imperfect, suggests 
that without rate support, industry ROTE in

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocitymany geographies would have been around  
8 percent, or below cost of capital. If one believes 
that rates will be lower than they are today, some 
of our scenarios suggest the industry’s ROTE 
could revert to near its cost of equity over the 
next two years (Exhibit 7). Naturally, we recognize 
that significant regional differences might exist, 
depending on drivers like local inflation and the 
pace and effects of reductions in interest rates. 
But if interest rates globally decline, on average, 
as some forecasters are projecting, our models 
suggest that net interest margins (NIMs) might 
compress by 50 to 60 basis points, from just 
over 3.1 percent in 2023 to roughly 2.7 percent 
by 2030. If this occurs, economic profit growth 
witnessed recently from the increase in interest 
rates will diminish and ROTEs could again trend 
toward cost of capital. 

 — The wide variations in the industry across 

subsectors and geographies may skew how 
certain institutions are viewed relative to 
others. Structure and mix could significantly 

Web <2024>
<GBAR 2024>

influence how individual banks fare as conditions 
change. In some countries, including the United 
States, the United Kingdom, India, Germany, and 
Nigeria, performance improved in 2023 versus 
the 2010–22 period, while other countries, like 
Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, and Australia, saw 
lower ROTEs. These variations are also sectoral, 
with a roughly ten-point gap in returns between 
the highest- and lowest-returning sectors 
(Exhibit 8).

 — Banks may not be able to count on raising 

productivity or harnessing scale. These continue 
to be conundrums for banks in many regions of 
the world. AI hasn’t yet proved a panacea (though 
quite recently, some leading banks that have 
been first movers have publicly announced 
efficiencies from AI—for some of them in the 
billions of dollars, already worth as much as  
a point of efficiency ratio). Despite a global total 
of approximately $600 billion being spent  
by banks on tech that should be boosting 
productivity, labor productivity in some major 

While higher interest rates have supported recent economic profitability 
across banking, this trend could reverse if interest rates fall.

markets (for example, the United States) is 
declining (Exhibit 9).1 AI could change that, but at 
most banks, generative AI (gen AI) is currently  
in pilot mode. And with it comes more spending 
and more regulatory requirements, so many 
banks have adopted a cautious posture. Some of 
the winners are moving from this pilot approach 
to a domain approach, where they are looking to 
streamline domains end to end and applying  
all levers, including AI and gen AI. We will see 
when those effects show up in the data. Banking 
in many global markets also doesn’t exhibit 
absolute scale economies, though we do see 
scale effects in specific subsectors, like 
retirement record keeping and some parts of 
capital markets (see sidebar, “Does scale  
still matter?”). As a result, neither tech spending 

to raise productivity nor size has truly bent the 
cost curve for banks to squeeze out some extra 
points of margin. 

 — Improvement in margins may not be able  

to come from more cost cutting. To maintain 
current ROTE in the face of some macro- 
driven scenarios, the industry would need to 
reduce its cost per asset by 5 percent per 
annum, or five times the industry’s historic 
performance of 1 percent reduction per  
annum (Exhibit 10).

 — Attackers continue to pressure incumbents. As 
we described in last year’s Global Banking 
Annual Review, about two-thirds of financial 
asset value growth was in off-balance-sheet

assets (for example, mutual funds and 
alternatives).2 Nontraditional competitors  
(for example, nondepository companies  
and private capital) and well-funded neobanks 
peck at the largest profit pools. 

Macro uncertainties and industry-level issues also 
pose challenges: 

 — The cost of funds for banks could increase, 

driven by continued quantitative tightening that 
reduces total deposit volumes (–6 percent 
CAGR since 2021 in the United States and  
–10 percent at European Central Bank) and 
increased competition with money market  
flows in some markets (since 2021, 12 percent  
CAGR in the United States and 7 percent in  
the euro area). The resulting competition for 
deposits could drive costs higher.

 — Loan originations face the dual challenge of 

declining consumer and corporate demand. For 
example, US commercial real estate (CRE) 
originations are down 55 percent from their 
pandemic peak and 25 percent below their ten-
year average. At the same time, existing assets 
face potential devaluations—some of which are 
yet to be fully realized. For example, CRE price 
index was down 9 percent in the fourth quarter 
of 2023 in the United States and the euro area.  
A reduction in interest rates may help to smooth 
some of these effects, but with a large share  
of Russell 2000 Index companies losing money,3 
there’s no certainty that modest reductions  
will turn the tide. Additionally, rising credit costs 
from stressed consumers could crimp that 
growth to some extent, and many markets face 
devaluations of loan portfolios and refinancing 
cliffs from high-yield debt coming due for renewal.

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocityDoes scale still matter? 

Scale in banking—and the advantages it 
confers—has been debated across the 
industry for many years. Across our global 
study of more than 2,000 banks, we offer 
some empirical observations on the topic:

 — Local scale still matters in many 

places. In the United States, branch 
density is still predictive of deposit 
market share, and the vast majority of 
checking accounts are still originated 
in branches, even as servicing has 
moved to digital channels. With the 
importance of operational deposits, 
branch networks seem to be 
experiencing a new lease on life after 
enduring a decade of skepticism  
and digital conversion of footfalls. 
Having said this, in the recent decade 
or so, as we said in “Customer 
mindshare: The new battleground in  
US retail banking,” branch density has 
now become only one of four key 
variables (the others being Digital 
Quotient, customer experience 
perceptions, and local marketing spend) 
that predict share in local markets.  
In other markets—particularly those 

that are highly digital, with high 
population density and homogeneity—
branch density may be less relevant.

 — Scale matters in certain places. For 

example, in retirement record keeping, 
our benchmarking suggests a 
plateauing of the scale curve at five 
million participants. In some capital 
markets or consumer servicing 
businesses, amortizing a key fixed cost 
tech platform becomes a critical  
driver of unit economics. Scale can 
also help in marketing, with a halo 
effect being conferred on less-
advertised products under the same 
brand. In some markets, we also 
observe a “minimum scale” required to 
be competitive, although the benefits 
of scale plateau after this point.

 — Digital can cut both ways. While digital 
can lower barriers to entry in some 
markets and reduce scale advantages, 
sometimes the capital requirements  
to build a credible digital platform can 
create an entry barrier and confer 
scale effects on the first movers.

 — Vendor networks can reduce scale 
effects. In some markets up to a 
certain size and complexity, it’s easy to 
“rent” capabilities. Beyond that, it 
becomes more prudent to own those 
(for systemic resilience, proprietary 
differentiation, or other reasons like 
talent attraction). The maturity and 
vibrancy of the vendor ecosystem is 
therefore an important factor to how 
prominent scale effects become.

 — Complexity negates scale benefits. In 
most markets, as banks get larger,  
so does their management complexity, 
regulatory oversight, and obligations. 
This increases complexity, which in turn 
leads to additional costs and negates 
any economies of scale.

Our conclusion, therefore, on scale: it 
matters selectively, and CEOs and 
management teams need to know when 
it’s creating tailwinds versus headwinds. 
But quite often, counting on scale effects 
to boost comparative economics isn’t  
a reliable strategy.

 — Unrealized losses for held-to-maturity securities 
are predictably burning off and will shrink, with 
revaluations at lower rates, potentially opening 
the aperture for M&A. While the right M&A deal 
has the potential to transform a franchise, or  
just add valuable new capabilities (for example, 
digital customer acquisition tools), large-deal 
M&A is not a certain path to success, since scale 
alone isn’t a predictor of margin growth in many 
markets. Putting aside any legal and regulatory 
uncertainty, successful M&A also requires 
robust integration planning and execution to 
mitigate the operational, cultural, and talent 
risks (among others) that can distract from day-

to-day business operations. Said another way, 
the bar for M&A in banking should remain high, 
even as the aperture for deals opens. 

 — Our projections for the original Basel III endgame 
impact on ROE were material. It remains to be 
seen what the recently released revised proposal 
will result in, but that could have a further 
moderating effect on ROTEs.

Add these challenges to the geopolitical 
uncertainties of the world today, and one can 
contextualize the impact on ROTE that the  
markets are foreseeing.

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocityAttaining escape velocity

For things to stay the same, things will have to change. 
—Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa (The Leopard, 1958) 

We believe that banks wanting to attain escape 
velocity will need to operate very differently from 
today to “avoid gravity.” To understand how they 
could do this, we looked at the track record of 
performance by some leaders, hoping to find clues 
to their longer-term health.

As we say this, it’s also important to note that banks 
are by nature fragile entities that first and foremost 
need to prioritize safety and soundness. Poor 
structural bets, like a lack of diversification by 
concentrating on one segment or over-rotating on  
a portfolio, can destroy banks through liquidity  
or credit quality. Some of the leading banks in the 
United States by the measure of ROE (and often, 
growth) from a few years ago were consumed by  
the regional banking disruption of 2023. Further 
back, prior to the GFC, the leaders were subprime 
originators. So when we look at winners, we’re 
cautious, looking at what they do through the lens  
of whether they are achieving their leadership 
prudently and sustainably.

With that in mind, we identified potential winners 
from around the world in four ways:

1.  First, we looked at banks that have separated 

from the pack in both ROTE and price-to-book 

multiples. This identified institutions that have 
outperformed their peers.

2.  Second, we looked at banks that have changed 

their position by more than five deciles of 
performance vis-à-vis their starting point five 
years ago. This identified institutions that  
have been successful at changing their 
performance positively.

3.  Third, we looked at banks that have consistently 
delivered above their cost of capital (a relative 
rarity in an industry where, between 2013 and 
2023, the average bank globally generated  
a $1 million economic loss, a figure which would 
have been substantially higher without the 
recent interest rate increases). This identified 
consistent performers.

4.  Finally, we looked at banks in the United States 
in the top decile of TSR, compared them with  
the bottom-decile banks, and then ran dozens  
of metrics through our models to unpack, 
statistically, the economic drivers of the top 
institutions’ TSR. This defined economic  
drivers that have propelled differentiated returns 
to shareholders in at least one major region.

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocityThe winners

When you come to a fork in the road, take it.
—Yogi Berra

Perhaps heeding the baseball sage’s advice, banking 
winners have achieved their position through a 
combination of both structural and execution moves. 
Neither strategy confers enduring advantages,  
but the combined effect puts banks in a position 
that’s market leading. For some contexts where  
we modeled the relative effects, execution (or how 
you operate) had two times the impact of structure  
(or where you compete), though both execution and 
structure are important. No bank we found among 
the winners appeared to be outperforming in only  
an average structural context nor being propelled 
solely by its structural position.

A few observations on the performance of these 
winners offer clues to enduring health.

There’s a path to escape velocity 

A total of 14 percent of banks are expected to  
create value and perform at a high level based on 
their current price-to-book multiple (more than  
one) and price-to-earnings multiple (more than 13), 
demonstrating that there’s a path to “escape gravity” 
in the industry (Exhibit 11). By comparison, about  
62 percent of publicly traded companies outside of 
banking achieve this same threshold (Exhibit 12).

The path is more common now 

In good news, higher performance is becoming 
more distributed across the industry (perhaps aided 
by the regulated nature of different markets). Today, 
14 percent of banks account for 80 percent of the 
economic profit in the industry, up from 11 percent in 
2013 (Exhibit 13). The figure is almost five times the 
average of all other industries, where performance 
is far more concentrated in a few players (Exhibit 14).

The outperformance can be large 

Our analysis of TSR outperformers (in the United 
States) shows that there’s a wide dispersion in 
performance: 14 points between the top and bottom 
deciles across 90 top US banks between 2013 and 
2023. Four operational metrics, along with avoiding 
risk, largely explain most of the outperformance of 
TSR: revenue growth (34 percent); better net interest 
margin management (34 percent) from lower cost; 
stickier deposit-gathering strategies (lowering the 
cost of funding) or better distribution and credit  
risk management into more lucrative lending 

activity, in both cases improving NIMs; growing fee 
income (16 percent) from expansion in advisory 
services, wealth management, and other fee-heavy 
businesses; and cost efficiency (5 percent), which 
while significant, has only a minimal explanatory 
effect on TSR (perhaps because costs are often in 
the bank’s control and many do manage down costs 
rapidly, so TSR becomes less differentiating). 

Many other metrics don’t contribute materially to 
TSR (for example, asset size at the institutional level, 
once again emphasizing institutional scale doesn’t 
matter as much). Calculating these kinds of metrics 
for your bank can help determine whether your  
bank is truly investing behind them. For example,  
do the projects in the tech portfolio support  
those outcomes?

Where you operate matters 

About one-third of these institutions are in attractive 
banking markets (for example, Australia, Canada, 
and India) that demonstrate high margins and strong 

14

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocityfundamentals (for example, demand for credit, 
demographics, and economic growth) (Exhibit 15). 
Within countries, too, operating in economically 
vibrant regions naturally confers growth advantages. 
The same story plays out with portfolio mix. Some 
subsectors, like payments, generate ROEs of  
14 percent and price-to-book multiples of six. While 
others, like universal and commercial banking, 
generate 12 percent ROTEs, with price-to-book 
multiples of 0.8.

Performance also matters 

Endowment or structure—or where you operate—
isn’t the only thing that matters; performance matters 
too. Institutions have achieved and sustained high 
levels of performance through deliberate strategic 
choices around structure and bold moves around 
execution. These winners operate across all  
sectors and geographies. These are the institutions 
you might be interested in unpacking and  
perhaps replicating.

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocityWhat do these banks look like? Since comparing 
widely varying geographies is pointless, we 
normalized some features to common benchmarks. 
The outperformers’ revenue growth is 1.5 times  
their local GDP growth, their fee-to-revenue ratio  
is typically 40 percent or higher, their efficiency 
ratio is lower than 50 percent, and their risk costs 
are generally well-managed enough through  
the cycle to be significantly below their reference 
industry’s costs (in amplitude as well as  
absolute average).

Where to compete (structure)

Winners have at least one of three structural 
markers that drive their performance:

 — Picking and decisively committing to the right 
segments for growth while avoiding the trap of 
over-rotating into them. Investing in growth by 
client segment or product type but not tipping to 
a point of concentrating exposure is crucial.

portfolios that inherently carry lower expense 
ratios, thereby lowering the institutions’ overall 
expenses. Other winners have leveraged their 
existing platforms in sectors that carry higher 
ROEs, like wealth and payments; a notable 
example is the mass affluent segment that, in 
many countries, composes the largest profit 
pool of wealth. Others have doubled down in 
capital markets to drive ROE-enhancing fee 
income growth. For most, these changes have 
been a handful of points of tilt in direction,  
not massive swings. But these winners have 
reallocated meaningful investments—in  
money, management bandwidth, and talent— 
to those tilts, and that has made a difference  
to their returns. 

 — Finding scale where it matters to drive 

productivity and acquisition. While in some 
countries, finding economies of scale is elusive 
at the overall industry level, scale does exist  
in pockets, and finding out how to harness it can 
thus have a significant effect. Some winners 
have found those pockets and doubled down on 
their position to create more margin by moving 

up the scale curve. Examples include finding 
economies of scale in marketing spending; in 
segments like retirement and wealth brokerage; 
and in parts of custody operations or customer 
servicing that are more standardized and where 
economies of scale therefore exist. Additionally, 
scale can be local, regional, national, or global, 
and the best banks maximize the scale benefits 
in key areas around these axes.

 — Optimizing location—either geographically or  
in the customer value chain. Positioning is 
clearly important, and some banks have chosen 
to shape their footprint either transnationally in 
countries or domestically in states and provinces 
that show higher-than-average economic 
prospects. Other banks have occupied strategic 
positions along the value chain. For example,  
a European mortgage institution has moved up 
the commerce funnel by offering a home search 
capability to consumers rather than being 
relegated to the bottom of the funnel, where 
consumers looked for financing after  
finding their home.

17

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocityHow to win (execution)

Execution excellence also provides an edge. For 
many institutions, there are limits to what can be 
done structurally (for example, shifting geographies 
and entering more attractive lines of business). 
More disciplined focus can be on targeting specific 
profit pools, more granular pricing capabilities,  
and better tailored customer segments for growth, 
among other approaches. 

To illustrate some examples, we looked among the 
winners to curate a selection of strategies that 
different institutions have deployed to propel their 
returns. No institution can excel at everything, but 
each winner does excel at something. 

The following are some execution-based approaches 
we observed among the winners across the globe:

 — Deepening relationships (one customer-centric 
bank and ecosystems). This is particularly a 
factor in the corporate space that has seen less 
of this strategy than of the consumer approach, 
which benefited from a branch system that 
naturally served up many products via a common 
channel. Delivering the right mix of mutually 
reinforcing businesses across balance-sheet-
intensive and fee-generating activities (for 
example, bringing a one-bank approach to 
deposits, lending, wealth, and other solutions, 
like payments products) spreads the cost of 
acquisition of an expensive customer across 
more of the bank. Some winners excel at 
providing wealth services to corporate 
customers; others offer higher ROE payments 
products to small businesses that otherwise 
would remain just credit customers. In emerging 
markets and increasingly in more mature 
banking markets, winners have been adding 
services beyond banking (such as loyalty, 
coupons, vouchers, personalized offers, 
marketplace services, gamification, and 
integrating with lifestyle and social media apps)  
to increase customer engagement and 
usefulness. This doesn’t just reduce churn  
to near zero but also deepens relationships 
substantially. In some cases, there may  
also be substantial third-party revenue from 
these carefully designed ecosystems.

 — Achieving retail or small and medium-size 

business (SMB) customer primacy through a 
personalized funnel. A North American leader 
has retooled itself to be able to create a more 
personalized experience for its customers,  
all the way from marketing to service. It has 
focused on products like wealth and home 
equity to create rapid cycle propositions (as 
many as four marketing campaigns a month). It 
has attached that to a segmentation that  
drives who answers the phone, the script used, 
and ultimately what kinds of ongoing servicing 
support the customer experiences (for example, 
at what points it checks in on the customer  
and what types of offers it mails to them). The 
company uses a dashboard to update all  
the key metrics in almost real time, enabling 
self-generating improvement loops. This  
has resulted in a dramatically lower cost of 
acquisition and decreased customer attrition 
levels, resulting in longer lifetime value. 

 — Leveraging granular pricing and risk selection. 
A leader that had long prided itself on both 
customer access and speed of decision making 
to build its book of complex lending (for example, 
mortgages and SMB loans) realized a few years 
ago that these two edges were being competed 
away by the ubiquity of digital offers and the 
inevitable compression of decision-making time. 
Indeed, in its market today, the vast majority of 
approvals are achieved in a matter of hours. The 
institution therefore invested heavily in data  
and analytics to build a truly microsegmented 
view of its customers. These clusters of 
customers, linked together by both need and 
behavioral characteristics, have helped the  
bank expand into new, previously underserved 
segments—and to better price existing 
segments to match its risks. It has also married 
its complex lending with a network of partners 
offering additional value-added services, further 
diversifying its sources of revenue.

 — Building world-class lead generation in  

wealth management. A wealth manager with  
a large team of financial advisers decided  
to fundamentally shift its approach to lead 

18

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocitygeneration and economics. The institution 
recognized that there were three outsize drivers 
of capturing “money in motion”: the right offer, 
the right time, and delivery through the right 
channel. Getting these three things right rather 
than going about them randomly is delivering  
a propensity to convert that’s almost 20 times 
higher than that of typical adviser outreach.  
By building an analytical model that combined 
client data with these kinds of triggers, along 
with a rigorous A/B-testing program, the 
institution was able to provide materially better 
leads to its financial advisers, just in time. Not 
only did this result in a double-digit increase in 
customer and asset conversion, but the 
institution was able to fundamentally change  
the economics on these clients, with a lower 
financial adviser fee share.

 — Achieving retail or SMB customer primacy 
through mobile-orchestrated distribution.  
A winner that operates in a digitally forward 
nation has invested heavily in making the  
shift from thinking about an omnichannel 
distribution strategy to using one that’s truly 
mobile orchestrated. It has elevated mobile  
as the orchestrator of all customer journeys 
(which deepens relationships and routes 
customers to the right service point effectively); 
standardized all other channel operations, 

turning these channels into interfaces of the 
same process (which reduces operation  
costs and complexity); moved many services 
that require specialized expertise into a  
remote advisory model (which enables efficient 
deployment; and moved the “system intelligence” 
into an “orchestration brain” across the customer 
relationship management, funnel management, 
and customer value management systems 
(which makes it harder for competitors to copy 
the model). This has improved revenues by 
simplifying customer acquisition and deepening 
relationships; reduced costs by moving some staff 
out of the branch (and reducing branch footprint) 
and into contact centers (with AI-supported self-
service capabilities increasing as well); improved 
customer experience, as customers are delighted 
with the ease and simplicity of banking with  
the institution; and aligned what were previously 
diverse tech platforms into coordinated, cloud-
based platforms with near-zero marginal  
costs to serve. As a result, this institution now 
leads peers in four dimensions: growth, 
relationship depth, customer satisfaction,  
and operating leverage.

 — Using strategic talent management to win with 
clients and unlock productivity. Some winners 
are focusing on their return from talent and 
using their people to differentiate their client 

No institution can excel  
at everything, but each winner  
does excel at something. 

19

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocityvalue proposition. They have created a strategic 
HR capability to recruit candidates in days 
instead of months, compensate at the top 
quartile, maintain employee satisfaction scores 
(including by providing mission motivation, not 
just monetary incentives), and inspire their 
workforces to go above and beyond to serve 
their customers. Most effective leaders are 
leveraging workforce and talent optimization  
to drive change. They leverage three set of 
changes: rapid interventions into location, 
pyramids, and other areas; moves to rewire the 
organization for future success, such as  
with centralization and reduction in shadow 
functions; and the capture of opportunities to 
fundamentally strengthen the talent backbone 
with better workforce planning.

 — Picking the right spots in wholesale banking to 
win. A regional bank recognized that it would 
never reach the scale to win across wholesale 
banking holistically. Instead, it undertook 
building specialized sector offerings (vertically 
integrated across the entire sector’s value  
chain) to become the destination institution for 
clients in those spaces. It invested deliberately  
in talent, footprint, marketing and thought 
leadership to build its brand in these areas. In 
addition, it focused heavily on becoming the 
one-stop shop for clients in this space, making it 
easy for them to access treasury management 
services, payroll (through partners), and a host 
of other related activities. Rather than being 
threatened by private-credit players, the bank 
has embraced them, creating new unique 
opportunities for its clients to access additional 
financing through its private-credit partners and 
providing it with a new revenue source.

 — Building an AI-enabled bank. While intelligence 
that’s truly artificial is still emerging, there are  
a few leading institutions that have leaned very 
heavily into using advanced analytics, which 
include machine learning, deep learning, and 
more recently, gen AI and other approaches. 
They have built this into their cultural fabric (for 

example, there’s no central analytics group, as 
analytics are embedded in every cell, and they 
have compliant model validation processes that 
are three times faster than the average) and 
operating models (for example, their data 
structures are best in class; they have made 
strategic investments in the ecosystem, 
including analytics start-ups; and their talent is 
best in class). Their focus is therefore tilted 
toward scalable businesses where they can 
leverage their analytical prowess to drive  
digital interactions supplemented with human 
interactions at critical points where needed.  
We think that this model (which we’re seeing 
different banks deploy on every continent)  
will become more common as digital interactions 
proliferate, AI becomes more democratized,  
and talent becomes more skilled.

 — Using proven operating models to unleash 

speed at scale, safely. Several winners have built 
(and branded) their operating models. These  
are variations of “digital factories,” “product and 
platform,” or more aggressively, “independent 
mini-companies” that are able to operate under 
the same umbrella with more independence 
while automating a large portion of common 
services. What we have observed is that infused 
into these operating models is a can-do culture. 
There’s aspiration and ambition, respect for 
expertise, and a dedication to the customer. 
There’s also generosity, collaboration, and  
a spirit of involving control functions early on  
and often to prevent surprises at the end. 
There’s an obsession with details and a top-
down mandate to keep at the forefront while 
always being prudent—a difficult balance  
to achieve culturally. These banks outperform 
because they just make things work more 
smoothly, and the decisions they take at the top 
translate into action at the front line far faster 
than seen with others. Building these operating 
models and role modeling and nurturing the 
culture and behavior that optimizes the speed 
they work at has been the secret sauce for many 
of the winners that use this approach.

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocity‘ Management quotient’ 
as a differentiator 

About 10 percent of global banks have been 
successful at raising their performance by as much 
as five or more deciles of the industry’s ROTE 
distribution, showing that breakout performance is 
indeed possible in this sector (Exhibit 16). But 
overall, our analysis shows that there doesn’t seem 
to be a lot of relative positional movement in the 
industry. Only 5 percent of banks dropped their 
performance by five or more deciles, about half the 

industry remained within one decile of its starting 
position, and roughly two-thirds of the industry 
remained within two deciles of its starting position. 
Change is clearly not easy. But conversely, this  
isn’t an industry where you can statistically wait for 
your competitors to score own goals and hope that 
improves your relative position. With the average 
bank historically eroding economic value and the 
industry globally trading at below-book value of

move to “fight gravity” and achieve liftoff in the face 
of the coming headwinds we described earlier.

The economic returns4 from most industries in the 
world very roughly resemble a bell curve5 (maybe 
this suggests some element of randomness in their 
results, a symptom of external and myriad forces at 

work outside management’s control) but with far 
more concentration around the average (Exhibit 17). 
Banking appears similarly hewn to the distribution 
shape of other industries but with more dispersion 
around the average. Can this greater fragmentation 
of results be where more opportunity lies—either 
from structural consolidation of lower performers or 
from some of the outliers taking share? Naturally

4 Returns above cost of capital.
5  The shape of the distribution of corporate results somewhat resembles a normal distribution but with a lot more modality or skewness around 

the mean. For nonbanking companies, 96 percent of their returns fall within half a standard deviation of the mean versus 38 percent for a 
Gaussian or normal distribution, and 98 percent fall within one standard deviation versus 68 percent. But by the time one gets to the second 
standard deviation, 99 percent fall within two standard deviations, consistent with the 99 percent of a Gaussian normal distribution. Banks  
are a little less skewed (or more normalized) than other industries are, with 86 percent of banks falling within half a standard deviation,  
95 percent within one standard deviation, and 99 percent within two standard deviations.

22

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocity 
 
the regulatory oversight of banks differs greatly 
from what many other sectors experience, so  
there are some different forces at work. But would  
a stronger “management quotient” change  
the skewness by creating more outliers as more 
companies outperform? 

The general tightness in distribution around  
the average and the previously quoted figures of  
the relatively small amounts of movement in 
performance speak to how hard improving 
performance is. The industry is rife with examples  
of well-intentioned ideas and initiatives that  
didn’t anticipate second-order effects that weren’t 
sustained over time (for example, cost-cutting 
programs that lasted two years only to see costs 
“walk back in the door”) or that ran at cross 
purposes (for example, poorly designed mobile  
apps that led to increases in call center volumes 
instead of the reductions planned in the business 
case). For example, our GCI Analytics subsidiary 
that tracks detailed metrics in commercial banking 
and cash management in the United States has 
tabulated several instances of increases in prices 
that led to enough customer attrition that more  
than offset the additional revenue. Research has 
consistently found that only 30 percent of 
transformations fully succeed, while 70 percent 
either only partially succeed or entirely fail.  
But management can make a real difference to 
these outcomes.

Given the market’s current view of banking and  
the gravitational forces at work, management teams 
can seize the moment to separate from the pack. 
They can create real dynamism by answering five 
core questions:

 — The hand you have been dealt. Given market 

structure matters (fragmented versus 
concentrated, public versus private, and global 

versus national versus regional versus community 
focused), what’s your thesis about how the 
fundamental economics in your specific market 
will play out? What are the empirical drivers  
of your and your competitors’ market values that 
could realistically be influenced to drive relative 
competitive advantage? 

 — The hand you play. Once you have isolated and 

accounted for market-structure-oriented drivers 
of enterprise value, how much of the residual 
value gap to your competitors can be closed by 
further harnessing endowments your bank 
enjoys (for example, brand and community 
loyalty)? How much would need to rely on 
execution factors (for example, moves you make 
and businesses you grow into)?

 — Tilting the scales. Where are the points of 

disproportionate structural leverage (for example, 
via scale, portfolio mix, and relationship depth)? 
Where are the points of disproportionate 
executional leverage (for example, from better 
risk selection, talent selection, pricing,  
and marketing)? How much of this leverage  
is organically capturable?

 — Friction or frictionless. Is your operating model 

set up to translate ideas to actions fluidly, or does 
it sometimes feel like you’re wading in mud when 
trying to get things done internally? What exactly 
is getting in your way? What can be learned and 
adapted from more nimble executors?

 — Improvidus, apto, quod victum.6 How fast do 

you tack to changing trends and competitors’ 
moves? Who are the “beacons” you have set 
yourself and your management team to emulate, 
so you can leap ahead?

6 Improvise, adapt, and overcome.
