EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Riding Out
the Storm

W ith  clouds  brewing  on  the  horizon, 

recent  years  might  provide  a  sense 
of how the fashion industry will ride 
out 2024.

The  industry  has  shown  its  resilience  in  recent 
years,  having  achieved  more  than  double  the  levels 
of economic profit in 2022 than in all years between 
2010 and 2020 except for one, yet by 2023 the industry 
was facing challenges that were both persistent and 
deepening.  On  a  regional  basis,  Europe  and  the  US 
experienced slow growth throughout the year, while 
China’s  initially  strong  performance  decelerated  in 
the  second  half.  Though  the  picture  for  luxury  was 
more positive than the rest of the market in the first 
half of 2023, consumers’ appetite to shop for fashion 
was diminishing across the board by the second half, 
leading  to  slowing  sales  and  uneven  performance. 
Even  luxury  began  to  feel  the  heat  after  a  lengthy 
period of growth that benefitted the entire industry. 
Looking to 2024, fashion leaders are anticipating 
further headwinds and are uncertain about prospects 
for  the  year  ahead.  Indeed,  the  word  most  often 
mentioned by executives in the BoF-McKinsey State 
of Fashion 2024 Executive Survey was “uncertainty.” 
Consumer  confidence  will  remain  fragile,  although 
for  different  reasons  in  key  markets  of  the  US, 
Europe and China. As a whole, the fashion industry is 
predicted to achieve year-on-year retail sales growth 
of between 2 percent and 4 percent in 2024. 

Aside  from  economic  challenges,  one  pressure 
point  that  cannot  be  ignored  in  the  year  ahead  is 
the climate crisis. After numerous extreme weather 
events  in  2023,  leading  companies  are  likely  to 
bolster  their  resilience  to  climate  impacts  in  2024. 
Inaction  is  no  longer  an  option:  extreme  climate 
events  are  already  placing  the  lives  and  livelihoods 
of fashion workers in danger and could put at risk an 
estimated $65 billion of apparel exports by 2030.

How  should  fashion  companies  prepare?  With 
cost-saving  tactics  mostly  exhausted,  the  focus  is 
expected  to  be  on  growing  sales,  underpinned  by 
new  pricing  and  promotion  strategies,  rather  than 
volume  increases  —  across  the  industry,  net  intent 
to raise prices is more than 50 percent, according to 
the BoF-McKinsey Executive Survey. Cost pressures 
are  predicted  to  abate,  with  less  than  20  percent 
of  executives  expecting  the  cost  of  goods  sold  and 
selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  to  rise 
more than 5 percent.

In  2024,  the  industry  is  expected  to  bear 
the  impact  of  fluctuations  in  demand  that  have 
punctuated the past few years. It is during such times 
that  supply  chains  experience  a  “bullwhip  effect,” 
in  which  small  sales  variations  cause  high  levels 
of  volatility,  leading  to  factory  underutilisation, 
layoffs  and  delayed  infrastructure  investments.  To 
navigate  these  challenges,  fashion  brands  should 
consider  investing  in  developing  more  transparent

The State of Fashion 2024Executive Summary

Looking to 2024, fashion leaders are anticipating further 
headwinds and are uncertain about prospects for the year 
ahead.

and collaborative relationships with their suppliers.

Meanwhile, fashion supply chains could be under 
increased  scrutiny  amid  incoming  regulations  on 
several  fronts.  This  includes  new  sustainability 
rules  in  the  European  Union  and  the  US,  which 
will  require  brands  and  manufacturers  to  double 
down on initiatives aimed at cutting greenhouse gas 
emissions and waste, while building business models 
that protect and preserve natural resources. The fast-
fashion industry, which has already been buffeted by 
a cohort of companies like Shein and Temu that are 
not  only  faster  and  cheaper  but  also  fuelled  by  big 
marketing budgets, may be particularly pressured by 
these new regulations. 

When seeking to identify growth levers, one area 
that  respondents  to  the  BoF-McKinsey  Executive 
Survey  said  they  are  homing  in  on  is  generative  AI, 
where  there  is  significant  potential  in  creativity-
focused use cases in design and product development. 
Some  73  percent  of  executives  expect  to  prioritise 
gen AI in 2024, but many may face a talent gap, given 
that just 5 percent said they are ready to make best 
use of the technology.

Marketing is another area of focus. After years of 
relying on performance marketing, brand marketing 
may increasingly take centre stage in the year ahead, 
with  71  percent  of  executives  planning  to  spend 
more  on  brand  marketing  than  in  2023  in  a  bid  to 
cultivate  emotional  connections  with  customers. 

11

At  the  same  time,  brands  may  find  consumers  are 
more demanding when it comes to authenticity and 
relatability,  leading  to  a  shift  towards  influencers 
who  are  more  quirky,  vulnerable  and  less-polished. 
Forward-looking companies should consider leaning 
into  this  new  wave  of  content  creators  to  enhance 
their brand stories. 

As  consumers  travel  with  renewed  enthusiasm 
in  the  year  ahead,  fashion  companies  may  need  to 
revamp  how  they  engage  with  consumers  who  are 
shopping abroad. For the first time since the Covid-19 
pandemic,  travel  levels  in  2024  are  projected  to 
exceed  those  in  2019.  Chinese  travel  to  overseas 
destinations is expected to reach between 70 percent 
and  100  percent  of  pre-pandemic  levels  in  2024.  As 
these  shoppers  return,  there  is  a  growing  desire  for 
brand  experiences  and  traditional  shopping  trips 
in  both  tourist  destinations  and  second-tier  cities. 
Alongside  a  return  to  travel,  there  is  also  a  shift  to 
spending more time outdoors, which will likely drive 
up demand for outdoor wear in 2024, further blurring 
the lines between functionality and style. 

All told, executives are bracing for a strategically 
challenging year ahead. Fashion leaders need to plan 
carefully  for  a  range  of  different  scenarios,  become 
better  equipped  to  manage  pricing  and  get  ready  to 
accelerate when the storm begins to clear.

looking 
towards  2024  are  on  edge.  The  most 
prominent 
fashion 
leaders  is  “uncertainty,”  according  to  the 
BoF-McKinsey  State  of  Fashion  2024  Executive 
Survey.1  Causes  for  concern  include  geopolitical 
events,  weakened  economies  and  the  continuing 
impact  of  high  interest  rates.  Yet  executives  also  
see  some  reason  for  optimism  in  specific  markets  
and segments.

Looking ahead to 2024, 26 percent of respondents 
to the survey conducted in early September expected 
conditions  to  improve  year  on  year,  37  percent

expected conditions remain the same and 38 percent 
expected the situation to worsen, marking the biggest 
divide in executives’ expectations for the year ahead 
since  the  inception  of  the  BoF-McKinsey  survey  in 
2017.2  Yet  the  outbreak  of  the  Israel-Hamas  war  in 
October  underscores  the  uncertain  environment, 
raising questions about whether a regional widening 
of the conflict could impact the global economy and 
have ramifications for the fashion industry. 

Geopolitics  continue  to  be  a  firm  fixture  on 
executive  radars  —  62  percent  of  respondents  to 
the  survey  cited  geopolitical  instability  as  the  top 
risk  to  growth,  while  economic  volatility  is  cited

Inflation  concerns  appear  to  be  diminishing. 
Among  surveyed  respondents,  51  percent  cited

year’s  survey,  perhaps  an  acknowledgement  that 
central  bank  policies  are  starting  to  achieve  their 
intended results, after inflation rates began rising to 
historic highs in the US and Europe in 2022.3

Overall,  non-luxury  retail  sales  growth  is  forecast 
to remain steady year on year in 2024 at between 2 
percent and 4 percent. In Europe, non-luxury growth 
of  between  1  percent  and  3  percent  is  expected, 
after  recording  5  percent  in  the  first  half  of  2023 
and  1  percent  to  3  percent  in  the  second  half,  due 
to  slumping  consumer  confidence  and  declining 
household  savings,  among  other  factors.5  When 
taking into account the forecasted high core inflation 
of around 3 percent to 4 percent, the growth outlook

is even more limited.6

In  the  US,  non-luxury  growth  is  forecast  at 
0  percent  to  2  percent  amid  declining  consumer 
sentiment.7  Slightly  slower  increases  in  the  rate  of 
inflation — forecast at around 2 percent to 3 percent 
in 2024 — may result in mildly more positive growth. 
However, a “soft landing” is forecast if, as expected, 
the  country  avoids  outright  recession,  helping 
inflation  to  get  under  control  more  quickly  than  in 
Europe.8  E-commerce  activity  is  expected  to  pick 
up  after  the  post-pandemic  slowdown  in  which 
consumers rebalanced spend towards in-store retail. 
Among  survey  respondents,  64  percent  identified 
owned online channels as a more important growth 
driver than in the previous year.9 

In China, non-luxury demand remains relatively 
weak compared to historical growth rates, reflecting 
economic  uncertainty  and  subdued  consumer 
confidence.  Even  so,  growth  is  projected  to  outpace 

include  subdued 

that of the US and Europe, at 4 percent to 6 percent.

Positive  factors 
the  ongoing  expansion  of  the  middle  class,  which 
is  underpinning  demand  for  contemporary  and 
premium 
fashion.  Consumer  sentiment  shifts 
towards  trading  down  are  also  bolstering  the 
large  mass-market  segment.  More  opportunities 
within  growth  categories  such  as  sportswear  and 
outdoor wear will likely be supurred by government 
initiatives  and  shifting  consumer  preferences  for 
healthier lifestyles and wellbeing.10

Luxury’s Restraint

Luxury’s  global  retail  sales  growth  is  forecast  to 
slow  to  between  3  percent  and  5  percent  in  2024, 
from  between  5  percent  and  7  percent  in  2023,  as 
consumers restrain spending after a post-pandemic 
shopping surge.11

percent and 5 percent is predicted in 2024, compared 
to 10 percent in the first half of 2023 and 5 percent to 7 
percent in the second half of the year. An anticipated 
rise  in  inbound  tourism,  boosted  by  Paris’  hosting 
of  the  Olympic  and  Paralympic  Summer  Games, 
will  likely  be  a  growth  driver,  as  will  a  pipeline  
of  store  openings  in  tier  two  and  tier  three  cities 
across Europe.12 13

In the US, luxury is expected to grow at 2 percent 
to  4  percent  year  on  year  in  2024,  compared  to  1 
percent in the first half of 2023 and between 1 percent  
and 3 percent in the second half. This would represent 
a return to the long-term pace, with slightly stronger 
sales  driven  by  higher-end  aspirational  brands. 
However, the luxury boom of recent years is not likely 
be rekindled. Rather, stabilisation at a lower level is 
expected.  A  strong  dollar  against,  for  example,  the 
euro may also lead to some spend shifting abroad.14

As  for  China,  luxury  growth  of  4  percent  to  6 

percent  is  expected,  compared  to  16  percent  in  the 
first half of 2023, which dropped to between 1 percent 
and 3 percent in the second half. Though moving in 
the right direction, the projected growth rate in the 
year  ahead  stands  in  sharp  contrast  to  2020’s  32 
percent  and  2021’s  40  percent.  Renewed  uptake  of 
international travel may dampen domestic demand, 
as  affluent  consumers  resume  shopping  for  luxury 
outside the country. However, it’s worth noting that 
the  size  of  China’s  luxury  market  remains  almost 
double what it was in 2019.15

While  the  biggest  fashion  markets  are  seeing 
only  tepid  signs  of  renewed  growth,  others  may  be 
more  compelling.  When  asked  about  the  countries 
or  regions  they  believe  will  be  the  most  promising 
in  the  year  ahead  compared  to  2023  in  the  survey 
conducted in September, executives cited the Middle 
East  (51  percent  net  intent),  India  (39  percent  net 
intent) and Asia Pacific (34 percent net intent). North

Strategic Priorities

As climate change continues to gather pace, fashion 
executives  remain 
focused  on  building  more 
sustainable businesses. When identifying the biggest 
challenges  and  opportunities  in  the  year  ahead, 
some  12  percent  cite  sustainability  as  a  principal 
opportunity  for  2024,  placing  it  at  the  top  of  the 
C-suite  agenda.  However,  reflecting  the  scale  of  the 
task  and  rising  regulatory  pressure,  12  percent  also 
name it as a top challenge.21 Finding a balanced way 
to implement sustainability improvements and risk-
reduction programmes with competitive advantages 
is likely to be a key challenge for fashion executives 
in 2024. 

Another opportunity high on executives’ agendas 
is  an  innovation  that  has  been  surrounded  by  buzz 
in  2023:  artificial  intelligence,  and  particularly 
generative  AI.22  Given  its  application  across  the 
fashion  value  chain  and  among  functions,  fashion 
companies  are  already  starting  to  experiment 
cautiously.  Those  efforts  are  likely  to  continue  in 
2024, with a view to scaling use cases where there are 
demonstrable performance upsides.

As  for  consumers  across  markets,  discretionary 
spend  is  likely  to  zero  in  on  categories  and  brands 
on which they feel they can rely. Hard luxury goods 
—  jewellery  and  watches  —  as  well  as  leather  goods 
are  emerging  as  key  categories,  as  more  players 
enter  the  market  and  consumers  seek  to  invest  in 
pieces  that  will  maintain  or  increase  in  value  over 
time.23 Meanwhile, focused brand-building may help 
companies  stave  off  challenges  across  segments, 
with consumers gravitating towards brands with the 
greatest differentiation and brand storytelling. 

In  the  face  of  an  uncertain  future  marred  by 
continued  macroeconomic

players cannot allow an ambiguous outlook to cloud 
decision  making  when  seeking  to  capture  growth

America and China recorded 8 percent and 3 percent 
respectively,  while  Western  Europe  was  negative  11 
percent.16

As  for  expanding  physical  footprints,  the  US, 
Middle East and Asia Pacific stand out as priorities, 
with executives reporting net intent of 44 percent, 45 
percent and 45 percent respectively. North America 
is the biggest investment destination, with 48 percent 
of executives citing footprint expansion plans in the 
region, compared to 44 percent in Western Europe.17  

Eyes on the Prize

Indeed,  pricing  strategies  are 

In  2024,  71  percent  of  surveyed  executives  said 
they  will  focus  on  increasing  sales,  compared  to  63 
percent  the  previous  year.18  Achieving  that  growth 
will  likely  require  laser-sharp  attention  on  pricing 
and  promotion  strategies,  with  a  large  portion  of 
investment directed to potential quick wins. 
likely 

to  be 
particularly  critical  given  weakening  prospects  for 
volume  growth.  Net  intent  to  raise  prices  across  the 
industry  is  50  percent,  with  69  percent  of  executives 
planning to lift prices, compared to 58 percent a year 
ago. Among the surveyed executives, 44 percent expect 
to raise prices by up to 5 percent, while 25 percent plan 
price  increases  of  more  than  5  percent.19  Companies 
that succeed in driving growth through price rises will 
likely take a precise, carefully tailored approach.

Simultaneously,  decision  makers  will  likely  keep 
a  tight  grip  on  costs  and  investments.  However,  the 
industry  has  already  seen  widespread  cost  cutting, 
suggesting  the  focus  should  be  on  stricter  controls 
rather than cuts.  

The  good  news  is  that  executives  expect  cost 
pressure  to  abate,  with  just  18  percent  of  executives 
predicting  their  companies’  cost  of  goods  sold 
(COGS) to grow more than 5 percent next year and 19 
percent expecting selling, general and administrative 
expense (SG&A) to rise more than 5 percent. This is 
in  contrast  to  last  year,  when  55  percent  expected 
COGS growth of more than 5 percent, and 40 percent 
expected SG&A growth of more than 5 percent. One 
reason  is  fading  concern  about  inflation,  with  12 
percent and 18 percent of executives expecting COGS 
and SG&A respectively to remain steady, compared to 
1  percent  and  3  percent  last  year.20  Additionally,  the 
successful implementation of cost measures over the 
last couple of years have already absorbed many of the 
potential cuts.

Reinvented 

In 2024, the global 
economic outlook 
will likely continue 
to be unsettled. 
As new and 
ongoing financial, 
geopolitical and 
other challenges 
weigh heavily 
on consumer 
confidence, fashion 
markets in the 
US, Europe and 
China are facing 
differing headwinds, 
requiring suppliers, 
brands and 
retailers to bolster 
contingency 
planning, among 
other measures.

The frequency and 
intensity of extreme 
weather-related 
events in 2023 mean 
the climate crisis 
has become even 
more visible, leaving 
the fashion value 
chain especially 
vulnerable. With 
climate risks 
worsening across 
continents, the 
fashion industry 
can’t hold off any 
longer on building 
resilience into its 
supply chains and 
helping to abate 
emissions.

Consumers are 
gearing up for the 
biggest year of 
travel since before 
the pandemic. But 
a shift in values 
means travellers 
have a different set 
of expectations, 
even as shopping 
remains high on 
the agenda. Brands 
and retailers should 
consider refreshing 
distribution and 
category strategies 
to meet travellers 
wherever they are.

It’s time for brand 
marketers to update 
their influencer 
playbooks. A new 
guard of creative 
personalities is 
gaining brands’ 
attention, 
winning trust and 
fandom among 
key audiences. 
Working with these 
personalities in 
2024 will require 
a different type of 
partnership, an 
emphasis on video 
and a willingness to 
relinquish a degree 
of creative control.

Technical outdoor 
wear has been 
propelled by 
consumers’ post-
pandemic embrace 
of healthier 
lifestyles as well as 
“gorpcore,” and is 
likely to accelerate 
even further in 
2024. More outdoor 
brands will likely 
launch lifestyle

lifestyle brands 
embed technical

further blurring

Capturing the

competition will

emotional 
connections to 
brands will likely 
be critical as 
fashion marketers 
reorientate 
their playbooks 
to emphasise 
long-term brand-

The era of the 
fashion industry 
self-regulating 
sustainability is 
drawing to a close 
around the world. 
Across jurisdictions, 
new rules could have 
a widespread impact 
on both consumers 
and fashion 
players. Brands and 
manufacturers need 
to revamp business 
models to align with 
the changes ahead.

Changes in 
consumer demand 
have resulted in 
the “bullwhip 
effect,” where cuts 
to orders increase 
in magnitude at 
different parts of 
a supply chain, 
putting pressure on 
fashion’s suppliers. 
Now, if supply 
is to keep pace 
with anticipated 
renewed demand, 
brands and retailers 
should consider 
focusing on 
transparency and 
bolstering  strategic 
partnerships.

•  Global GDP growth is set to slow to 2.9 percent in 2024, down 

from 3 percent in 2023 and 3.5 percent in 2022. 

•  Consumer spending may be tempered in the year ahead. In the 

third quarter of 2023, net intent to purchase apparel was 7 percent 
in China, but negative 25 in the US and negative 29 in Europe.

•  Emerging Asia provides potential growth spots, with 

India’s investment activity, domestic demand and developing 
infrastructure making it a promising market for fashion.

Consumers  around  the  world  might  be  mistaken  if 
they  believe  2024  will  offer  a  chance  to  catch  their 
collective  breath  after  enduring  a  post-pandemic 
period  of  turbulence.  Universally,  slowing  growth, 
new  and  continued  geopolitical  conflict,  and 
consumer  spending  pressures  are  likely  to  define 
economic  prospects.  And  as  in  previous  times,  the 
impacts  will  likely  not  be  felt  uniformly  as  market 
responses diverge. 

As  2023  rolls  towards  its  end,  forecasters  have 
readjusted  their  outlooks  as  the  strains  of  high 
inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes showed 
few signs of falling closer to target levels. By October, 
the  International  Monetary  Fund’s  forecast  put 
global  GDP  growth  at  2.9  percent  in  2024,  down 
from 3 percent in 2023 and 3.5 percent in 2022.24 The 
IMF cites slowdowns in advanced economies as the 
primary culprit.

at  the  US  Federal  Reserve  Bank  are  among  those  at 
central  banks  who  expect  interest  rates  to  remain 
“higher for longer.”26 27

What  will  likely  differentiate  2024  from  the 
past  few  years  is  that  consumers  in  key  economies 
may  be  confronting  different  challenges  from  each 
other,  thus  creating  additional  complexity  for 
fashion executives steering their companies through 
headwinds from region to region. 

In  Europe,  the  economic  picture  is  gloomy,  as  it 
continues  to  struggle  under  the  shadow  of  the  war 
in Ukraine. By the second quarter of 2023, Europe’s 
biggest  economy,  Germany,  saw  growth  stagnate, 
and the risk of a second recession within a year is still 
hovering.28 29 Meanwhile, in the UK, Europe’s second-
largest  economy,  growth  was  slow  as  the  economy 
attempted to shrug off 2022’s surge in inflation and 
adjust to 14 consecutive interest rate hikes.30 31

Inflation,  still  remaining  high,  will 

likely 
continue to be in the limelight. According to the IMF, 
the  global  headline  inflation  rate  is  set  to  fall  to  5.8 
percent  in  2024,  from  6.9  percent  in  2023  and  8.7 
percent  in  2022.25  Against  this  backdrop,  officials

confidence  hit  a  six-month  low  in  September.33  The 
euro zone’s ongoing cost-of-living crisis is straining 
many  households,  alongside  continued  higher  core 
inflation rates compared to the US.34 35

In the US, where Federal Reserve policies appear 
to have averted outright recession and achieved lower 
levels  of  inflation,  growth  prospects  seem  slightly 
brighter than those in Europe. However, GDP growth 
is expected to slow next year, from 2.1 percent down 
to 1.5 percent.36

Various  events  in  the  second  half  of  2023 
underscored  the  fragility  of  consumer  confidence 
in  the  country.  For  example,  in  October  US  policy 
makers  lifted  the  three-year  freeze  on  student-loan 
repayments,37 leaving 37 percent of respondents to a 
Morgan Stanley survey anticipating that they would 
have  to  cut  spending  in  order  to  make  payments, 
while 34 percent said they would not be able to make 
payments at all.38 Earlier in the year, credit card debt 
reached an all-time high of $1.03 trillion, according 
to central bank research, with high interest rates and 
financing charges also contributing to headwinds.39 

In  China,  2023  held  different  economic 

pressures. The economy moved into deflation, and an 
ongoing crisis in the property market — which drives 
25  percent  of  China’s  economy  —  left  apartment 
sales  in  August  47  percent  below  2019  levels.40  41 
Major  property  companies  are  buckling  under  the 
weight  of  unsustainable  debts  and  losses.42  Youth 
unemployment has been high, hitting 20.8 percent in 
May (the latest date that China’s National Bureau of 
Statistics published new figures).43 

Chinese  consumers  have  continued  building  up 
savings, while a return to spending has been slow.44  
At  around  35  percent  to  45  percent  of  GDP,  China’s 
gross  savings  rate  has  been  historically  high  and, 
according  to  the  World  Bank,  the  country  has  the 
highest savings-to-GDP rate among large economies. 
Indicators suggest that in 2023, China’s savings levels 
increased  further,  perhaps  as  households  expanded 
their safety nets out of precaution.45

In  contrast,  savings  pots  have  dwindled  in  both 
the  US  and  Europe.  An  unusual  amount  of  excess 
in  savings  was  built  up  in  these  regions  during 
the  Covid-19  pandemic,  but  analysis  now  suggests 
that  these  are  likely  to  run  out  by  the  end  of  2023,

after  consumers  returned  to  shopping  more  freely 
following  the  lifting  of  pandemic  lockdowns.  The 
subsequent  toughening  of  the  economic  climate 
in  2023  has  also  meant  that  it  is  difficult  for 
consumers  to  replenish  their  savings,  and  even  as 
savings  remain  reasonably  high  in  absolute  terms, 
inflation is causing them to devalue. This bodes ill for 
discretionary  spending  in  2024,  after  recent  years 
of  relatively  buoyant  consumption.46  47  Pressure  on 
household  budgets  is  likely  to  prompt  a  decline  in 
discretionary spend. In the third quarter of 2023, net 
intent to purchase apparel was negative 25 in the US 
and negative 29 in Europe, according to a McKinsey 
survey.48 

Rays of Light

Still, there are certain country-level reasons for some 
degree  of  optimism.  This  is  the  case  with  China, 
even  if  the  base  case  is  for  muted  demand  and  slow 
GDP  growth,  from  5  percent  in  2023  to  4.2  percent 
in  2023,  according  to  IMF  forecasts.  The  volume  of 
imports expanded 1 percent year on year in the first 

in  the  six  months  to  August.53  India’s  bellwether 
manufacturing  Purchasing  Managers  Index  (PMI) 
hit  a  31-month  high  in  May  and  the  services  PMI 
reached  a  13-year  high  in  July.  GDP  growth  stood 
at  6.9  percent  in  fiscal  2023.54  Strong  investment 
activity,  consistent  domestic  demand  and  a  policy-
maker  push  to  invest  in  infrastructure  buoyed  the 
rapid growth. This rate will likely moderate in 2024 
but  remains  strong  with  forecasted  GDP  growth  of 
6.3 percent.55

The  impact  of  2024’s  mixed  outlook  will  be  felt 
by fashion businesses across the value chain. Brands 
and  retailers  will  likely  need  to  confront  a  further 
wave of low consumer demand in some key markets, 
while  suppliers  may  feel  the  amplified  effects  of 
this  dampened  demand  even  more  as  it  echoes 
along  the  supply  chain,  leading  to  underutilised 
capacity.  Revenue  growth  in  this  environment  is 
likely to be driven by price rather than volume, and 
businesses  will  need  to  plan  price  increases  with 
care and precision to avoid alienating cash-strapped 
consumers. 

Universally, slowing growth, new and continued 
geopolitical conflict, and consumer spending pressures 
are likely to define economic prospects.

half of 2023 (compared with a decline of 6.4 percent 
in  the  same  period  in  2022),  indicating  a  tentative 
rise in domestic demand.49 50

Consumer spending plans in China appear to be 
marginally more positive than in the US and Europe, 
with  a  7  percent  net  intent  to  purchase  apparel 
as  well  as  jewellery,  and  8  percent  for  footwear, 
McKinsey  research  shows.  Meanwhile,  69  percent 
of consumers are planning to splurge on shopping.51 
However, even if cautious, optimism for the country 
should  be  tempered,  as  the  overall  outlook  may  be 
disappointing  —  forecasts  for  shopping  and  travel 
have  remained  dampened  in  recent  months,52  and 
growth is still well below historical levels.

Emerging  Asia  provides  potential,  too.  For 
example,  in  India,  consumer  confidence  reached  a 
four-year high in September 2023, while India-based 
executives  are  more  optimistic  than  western  peers, 
with  85  percent  of  respondents  to  a  McKinsey 
global  survey  saying  that  conditions  have  improved 

To  build  greater  resilience  across  value  chains 
in  2024,  fashion  decision  makers  can  focus  on 
contingency  planning,  ensuring  that  scenarios  take 
into account high levels of uncertainty and the range 
of  regionalised  consumer  demand  shifts.  Scenarios 
for  each  region  will  need  to  factor  in  increasingly 
divergent  underlying  factors.  Meanwhile,  strong 
inventory management is likely to remain a priority, 
continuing successful cost management programmes 
implemented in post-pandemic times. 

Meanwhile, suppliers can expect an increasingly 
competitive  landscape.  Manufacturing  sector  price 
wars  are  a  possibility  as  weak  consumer  demand 
puts pressure on orders and leads to excess capacity 
in  some  supply  chains.  Suppliers  may  want  to  work  
to  build  deeper,  collaborative  relationships  with 
brands to reduce exposure to price competitiveness, 
while  ensuring  they  retain  tight  control  of  costs  in 
the year ahead.

The Tumultuous 
Path to an Exit

By Sara Hudson, Pamela Brown, Leila Le Merle and Simona Kulakauskaitė

The fashion industry has struggled to attract 
investment over recent years, amid inconsistent 
performance and increasing polarisation. In this 
challenging environment, fashion businesses 
seeking funding should have solid performance 
fundamentals demonstrating sustainable 
profitability, clear brand equity and a path to value 
creation. Finally, market timing will be critical.

Private equity (PE) firms looking to exit their fashion 
industry  assets  in  2024  may  find  they  have  some 
difficult  choices  to  make.  Against  a  backdrop  of 
public  market  volatility,  finding  an  attractive  route 
to  exit  has  been  challenging,  to  such  an  extent  that 
future  deal-making  may  provide  less-than-ideal 
returns  and  raise  questions  about  the  long-term 
value  creation  opportunities  across  parts  of  the 
fashion industry.

The significant shift in fashion’s financial market 
performance  had,  in  fact,  already  started  in  2018. 
Apparel,  fashion  and  luxury  (AF&L)  companies 
generally  tracked  benchmark  indexes  closely  up 
until then, after which industry performance began 
to  diverge.  While  luxury  companies  outperformed 
the  MSCI  World  Index  by  14  percentage  points  
in  the  five  years  to  October  2023,  non-luxury  has 
underperformed  the  same  index  by  3  percentage 
points.56

A  similar  scenario  has  been  playing  out  in 
the  private  realm,  with  PE  investors  becoming 
increasingly  cautious  about  non-luxury  fashion 
categories,  with  deal  volume  stagnating  over  the 
last  decade  (except  for  2021  which  was  a  record 
PE  deal  year)  even  when  “dry  powder”  —  that  is, 
capital  available  for  investment  —  grew  in  the  PE 
industry  overall.57  In  early  2023  amid  an  overall 
downward  trajectory  in  the  broader  PE  space,  PE 
activity in AF&L ground to a halt due to pressure on 

discretionary  consumer  categories,  high  valuations 
and difficulties obtaining debt financing.58 

PE  firms  are  likely  to  continue  to  see  more 
limited  exit  options.59  On  one  side,  strategic  buyers 
have  not  made  many  investments  in  the  past  few 
years,  given  their  caution  around  adding  further 
complexity  to  their  portfolios,  and  have  focused 
instead  on  optimising  their  existing  operations.60 
PVH  Corp  and  VF  Corp,  for  example,  last  acquired 
targets in 2018 and 2020, respectively. On the other 
side, few PE-backed brands can reach the scale that 
an  initial  public  offering  requires.  This  then  means 
attracting another PE investor, but they will likely be 
confronting the same concerns about the industry’s 
long-term value creation as the public market.

An increasingly important priority for investors 
is  to  minimise  exposure  to  the  “fashion  risk” 
inherent  in  brands  that  rely  on  actively  shaping 
or  getting  fashion  trends  right.61  Naturally,  these 
brands  see  swings  in  popularity  over  time,  which 
makes  it  difficult  to  assess  their  value  at  any  point 
in time, encouraging investors towards brands with 
iconic,  timeless  designs  and  a  credible,  compelling 
brand story. Even if investors are able to identify the 
brands  with  staying  power,  the  added  challenge  of 
how to underwrite the intangible value — that is the 
value of the brand — adds complexity and risk to the 
deal-making process. 

PE players have long homed in on luxury targets,

for  example  the  sale  in  August  2023  of  luxury 
womenswear brand Zimmermann to PE firm Advent 
International.  However,  large  luxury  houses  and 
other strategic suitors are equally attracted to these 
assets  and  are  typically  also  active  bidders  when 
brands come onto the market. 

PE  firms  are  also  not  singularly  focused  on 
luxury  —  sportswear,  footwear,  wellness,  outdoor, 
modern  jewellery  and  intimates  are  on  their  radars 
too.62 Also in demand are B2B players further down 
the  value  chain  that  allow  PE  investors  to  gain 
exposure to the fashion industry indirectly (without 
assuming  fashion  risk).  Transactions  in  this  space 
include  Permira’s  acquisition  of  luxury  contract 
manufacturer  Gruppo  Florence  in  late  2022  and 
San Quirico’s 75 percent purchase of Minerva Hub, a 
metallic components and leather producer for luxury 
companies, in 2023.63

of  deals  that  have  exceeded  their  typical  holding 
periods  and  need  a  sale  to  realise  returns  for 
investors.  However,  about  half  of  the  assets  that 
are at or near the end of their holding periods are in 
segments  which  investors  are  increasingly  wary  of. 
Fashion-focused  women’s  apparel  currently  makes 
up  12  percent  of  this  cohort  in  EMEA  and  poses  a 
significant amount of trend-related risk.64 A number 
of  potential  deals  in  this  category  have  stalled  in 
2023,  including  Giuseppe  Zanotti  (L  Catterton), 
Sezane (General Atlantic), Isabel Marant (Montefiore 
Investment) and Ganni (L Catterton).65  

In  the  current  economic  climate,  PE  investors 
are  also  likely  to  be  cautious  about  department 
stores  and  other  “third-party”  retailer  assets  (e.g. 
online and offline retailers that primarily sell goods 
from other brands), amid increasing macroeconomic 
headwinds  and  narrow  profit  margins.  Third-party 
retail  accounts  for  36  percent  of  assets  held  (offline 
24 percent and online 12 percent).66

delaying exit or compromising on price. But PE firms 
could also decide to sell to brand management groups, 
some  of  which  have  started  making  acquisitions. 
Authentic  Brands  Group,  which  bought  Reebok  in 
2022,  as  well  as  WHP  and  Blue  Star  Alliance,  are 
among such acquirers specialising in turning around 
distressed assets. However, the prices on offer are not 
always going to be attractive.

The Public Market View

If  investors  cannot  sell  into  private  markets,  they 
may  look  to  the  public  markets  for  their  exit.  Since 
the  1980s,  there  were  on  average  two  to  four  AF&L 
IPOs  in Europe and North America every year. The 
number of AF&L IPOs spiked in 2019 as well as 2021, 
with 25 IPOs over those two years, and have included 
brands such as Zegna, Allbirds, Dr Martens as well as 
luxury marketplace The RealReal.67 

But  the  performance  of  newly  listed  AF&L 
stocks  has  generally  been  challenging.  Since  2018, 
the  stock  price  of  newly  floated  AF&L  companies 
has dropped an average of 40 percent one year after 
listing, according to data from McKinsey Corporate 
Performance Analytics.68 Exceptions include USWE 
(IPO in 2021), Revolve (2019) and Levi Strauss (2018). 
As of the third quarter of 2023, the stock prices 
of nearly all AF&L companies that had IPOs in 2021 

were  below  their  listing  prices.  An  outlier  is  On, 
whose  share  price  has  turned  a  corner  and  is  now 
trading  close  to  its  listing  value.  Another  exception 
from 2021’s IPO group is Zegna, whose shares at the 
end of September 2023 were up 13 percent.69

to 

Several 

factors  have  contributed 

the 
outperformance of Zegna and On. One is the strength 
of  the  brand  story.  The  heritage  of  craftmanship  of 
Zegna, born in wool mills in Italy and deeply rooted 
in  its  local  environment,  aligned  with  consumers’ 
desire  for  high-quality  fabrics.  Furthermore,  Zegna 
moved away from a reliance on formalwear towards 
classic  but  “quiet”  collections  in  time  for  the  quiet 
luxury boom in recent years. 

Investors  also  reward  consistent  and  strong 
top-line  growth.70  On  grew  revenue  more  than  60 
percent  in  both  2021  and  2022,  driven  by  its  highly 
innovative solutions and design that appeal to a broad 
group  of  customers  looking  for  comfort.  Zegna’s 
revenue grew 27 percent and 16 percent in those two 
years.71  Another  factor  is  that  strong  performers 
sit  within  in-demand  categories  like  luxury  and 
sportswear. Luxury now makes up close to half of the 
industry’s  total  economic  profit,  having  increased 
its  economic  profit  3.5  times  from  2018  to  2022. 
Sportswear’s  (including  sports  footwear)  economic 
profit grew 1.7 times from 2018 to 2022, despite a 17

percent drop in 2022.72

A  McKinsey  Global  Fashion  Index  analysis 
in  2023  of  publicly  listed  AF&L  enterprise  value 
between 2013 and 2023 suggests that while profitable 
growth  is  most  attractive  to  investors,  revenue 
growth  is  generally  more  heavily  rewarded  than 
margin  accretion.  Margin  accretive  companies  that 
grew  revenue  above  the  industry  average  saw  a  11 
percentage points uplift in enterprise value growth, 
compared  to  margin  accretive  companies  that  grew 
below  the  industry  average.  In  contrast,  companies 
that  grew  revenue  above  the  industry  average  only 
saw a 5 percentage points uplift if they were margin 
accretive  compared  to  those  that  grew  revenue  but 
were margin dilutive.

Signs of Revival

Towards the end of 2023, there were many rumours 
of  large  IPOs  for  AF&L  players,  including  Shein73 
and Skims,74 raising expectations for a return of deal 
activity. One of the highest profile IPOs of 2023 was 

tailwinds.  Of  course,  even  these  may  not  guarantee 
success.  Consistent  performance  in  meeting  (and 
exceeding) investor expectations is critical to share 
price performance. 

When  deciding  when  to  IPO,  owners  should 
closely  monitor  consumer 
trends  and  public 
perceptions,  as  well  as  the  performance  of  recently 
listed companies. In addition, PE owners listing their 
portfolio companies will need to consider the impact 
of retaining a meaningful stake post IPO.77 By doing 
so,  they  expose  themselves  to  share  price  volatility 
due  to  company  performance,  as  well  as  broader 
market moves. 

A  public  market  revival  is  typically  a  precursor 
of  PE  deal-making  and  the  funds  with  fashion 
specialisms  are  likely  to  move  first.  Non-fashion 
specialists  are  likely  to  remain  on  the  sidelines  for 
longer. Still, there are nascent signs of a more general 
shift  in  sentiment,  with  $1.2  billion  of  PE  “dry 
powder” putting pressure on funds to begin investing 
again.78  Meanwhile,  investment  committees  will 

For successful flotations, firms are expected to have a 
compelling equity story, sustained revenue and margin 
growth, ability to scale, and resilience amid category tailwinds.

Birkenstock,  whose  target  valuation  set  multiples 
at  18  times  EBITDA.  Despite  very  healthy  margins 
of  35  percent  EBITDA,  this  valuation  would  put 
Birkenstock  at  a  similar  or  even  higher  multiple 
to  LVMH  (15  times  EBITDA  for  the  current  year), 
and  the  same  multiple  as  Nike,  which  has  lower 
margins.75 Other shoe brands, such as Crocs and Dr 
Martens,  are  trading  at  six  to  seven  times  EBITDA. 
Despite  the  wave  of  brand  hype  generated  by  the 
“Barbie” movie (in which the shoe had a cameo) and 
strong  performance 
fundamentals,  Birkenstock 
stock  declined  in  value  in  the  first  week  of  trading. 
This  was  due  to  investor  concerns  over  how  long

look to the green shoots of M&A recovery, reflecting 
slightly  better  macroeconomic  fundamentals  in 
some  markets  and  valuations  starting  to  decline  to 
more transactable levels.79   

One  thing  is  certain:  given  the  volume  of  assets 
held  by  PE  players,  there  is  likely  to  be  a  queue 
for  the  exit  when  markets  pick  up,  potentially  
creating  a  bottleneck.  Within  PE,  aversion  to  
fashion  risk  and  concerns  about  discretionary 
categories  are  likely  to  remain  significant  barriers. 
Alongside  market  timing,  value  creation  will  
likely  remain  a  key  priority  for  2024.  Owners  
should  consider  focusing  on  brand  health,  topline 
growth  and  commercial  excellence 
(including  
getting  pricing  and  promotions  right),  while  also 
optimising  sourcing,  rethinking  categories,  and 
considering  new  occasions  and  channels.  For  those 
approaching  exit,  continuing  to  invest  and  not 
starving  the  assets  is  likely  to  be  key,  while  at  the 
same  time  hoping  for  consumer  sentiment  and 
discretionary spending to turn around.

Climate
Urgency

The frequency and intensity of extreme weather-
related events in 2023 mean the climate crisis has 
become even more visible, leaving the fashion value 
chain especially vulnerable. With climate risks 
worsening across continents, the fashion industry 
can’t hold off any longer on building resilience into 
its supply chains and helping to abate emissions.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  Fashion is responsible for between 3 percent and 8 percent of 

total greenhouse gas emissions.

•  By 2030, extreme weather events could jeopardise $65 billion 
worth of apparel exports and eliminate nearly one million jobs 
in four economies that are among the most central to the global 
fashion industry.

•  Fashion executives said other challenges such as economic 

uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and inflation will vie for their 
attention ahead of climate risk in 2024.

For  many  fashion  businesses,  addressing  climate-
related  risks  is  often  a  priority  that  is  eclipsed 
by  other  challenges  they  deem  more  urgent 
or  imminent.  However,  due  to  the  geographic 
footprint  and  structure  of  fashion’s  supply  chains, 
it is especially vulnerable to extreme and increasing 
climate volatility. In 2024, a mindset shift is needed 
across the industry to acknowledge that maintaining 
the  status  quo  is  no  longer  an  option  and  climate 
risk  cannot  be  viewed  as  a  long-term  project  to  be 
tackled  further  down  the  line.  The  past  year  has 
provided  ample  examples  of  why  climate  de-risking 
needs  immediate  action  given  fashion  value  chains’ 
exposure to extreme weather conditions around the 
world.80 De-risking will not be the sole responsibility 

of  manufacturers  —  brands  will  also  need  to  revisit 
their  supplier  standards  and  invest  to  ensure  they 
are  sufficiently  addressing  new  climate-related 
dimensions.

Globally,  2023  will  likely  be  remembered  as  a 
year of climate-related disasters, and the frequency 
of these disasters is only expected to increase due to 
climate  change.81  Soaring  temperatures  around  the 
world  will  make  2023  one  of  —  if  not  the  —  hottest 
years on record, which scientists say is the result of 
both El Niño weather patterns and global warming.82 
83 Sweltering temperatures, wildfires, torrential rain 
and flash floods have devasted communities around 
the world, leaving behind death and destruction. Few 
regions seemed to be spared.84 85 86 87 88

31

Though  the  human  and  environmental  tragedy 
looms  large,  it  is  also  hard  to  ignore  the  economic 
toll.  The  US,  for  example,  had  suffered  an  annual 
record,  at  $23  billion,  of  climate-related  disasters 
even before 2023 comes to an end, surpassing 2020’s 
record  high.89  And  drought  in  Argentina  in  2023 
could  cause  the  country’s  economy  to  shrink  by  2.5 
percent,  according  to  the  International  Monetary 
Fund.90 Beyond the Americas, China lost more than 
$7.6 billion due to severe drought in 2022.91 Globally, 
the cost of each climate-related disaster is estimated 
to have increased 77 percent over the past 50 years, 
reports the World Economic Forum.92

As  global  warming  exceeds  its  current  level  of 
1.1°C above pre-industrial levels, productivity growth 
is set to fall. With global warming levels potentially 
reaching  2.2°C  by  2050,  global  GDP  levels  could  be 
reduced by up to 20 percent, while warming of up to 
5°C  by  2100  could  lead  to  “economic  annihilation,” 
according to Oxford Economics.93

The  BoF-McKinsey  State  of  Fashion  2024 
Executive  Survey  found  that  executives  expect 

other  challenges  —  notably  economic  uncertainty, 
geopolitical tensions and inflation — to be vying for 
their  attention  ahead  of  climate  risk.94  Yet,  the  past 
year should be a wakeup call for fashion. With fashion 
still responsible for between 3 percent and 8 percent 
of  total  greenhouse  gas  emissions,95  a  mix  of  short- 
and long-term strategies can help companies address 
the climate challenge. Companies, for example, may 
look  to  de-risking  the  value  chain  and  revamping 
structural  and  operational  legacies,  or  doubling 
down on sustainability.

Outsized Risks for Fashion’s Value Chain

Every  part  of  the  fashion  value  chain  is  affected  by 
the  climate  crisis,  not  least  because  so  much  of  the 
industry is reliant on the countries and regions most 
directly impacted by climate upheavals, signifying an 
outsized risk for fashion in comparison to many other 
industries.  By  2030,  extreme  weather  events  could 
jeopardise  $65  billion  worth  of  apparel  exports  and 
eliminate nearly one million jobs in four economies 
that are among the most central to the global fashion

industry  —  in  Bangladesh,  Cambodia,  Pakistan  
and Vietnam.96

One  part  of  the  fashion  value  chain  that  is 
particularly  exposed  is  the  production  of  raw 
materials  supplying  manufacturers.97  Consider 
cotton,  which  is  sensitive  to  both  droughts  and 
flooding. In India, the world’s second-largest cotton 
exporter, extensive rainfall and pest invasions have 
reduced  its  supply  to  the  extent  that  the  country 
began  importing  it.98  Pakistan,  too,  has  been  hit  by 
extreme  monsoons,  while  in  contrast,  drought  has 
hit  Texas’  cotton  producers,  leading  to  abandoned 
crops and steep production declines.99 100 101

For manufacturers, flooding is also a growing risk, 
forcing temporary or permanent factory closures. In 
Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  Vietnam,  55  percent  of  apparel 
and footwear manufacturing sites could be exposed 
to rising sea levels and flooding by 2030.102 Not only 
are  the  livelihoods  of  factory  workers  impacted, 
but their health and safety as well. Factory workers 
in  Dhaka,  Bangladesh,  report  suffering  headaches, 

Weather-Proofing Strategies in 2024 and Beyond

Fashion executives in 2024 and beyond should embed 
climate strategies across their businesses. They may 
do  so  by  first  identifying  direct  value  at  risk  from 
potential climate impacts as well as material second- 
and  third-order  impacts  —  such  as  supply  chain 
disruptions,  damage  to  infrastructure,  or  financial 
and job losses — and implementing thorough scenario 
planning for these possibilities.

Boosting  resilience  up  and  down  the  value 
chain,  particularly  in  climate  risk  “hotspots,”  is 
critical.  Nimble  processes  are  needed  to  swiftly 
offset  weather-related  pressures  on  suppliers  and 
inventories  as  well  as  consumers.  Alongside  these 
operational  changes,  other  adjustments  must  be 
considered, 
including  sourcing  strategies  and 
locations  to  ensure  they  also  enable  flexibility  and 
speed in times of extreme weather events. This may 
require trade-offs between risk mitigation and cost, 
speed, capacity and availability of materials.

Action  by  manufacturers  must  take  the  form  of

exhaustion  from  dehydration  and  lack  of  sleep  due 
to  high  temperatures,  while  53  percent  of  surveyed 
Cambodian  workers  reported  becoming  unwell 
due  to  heat  stress.  Meanwhile,  as  temperatures 
climb,  productivity  is  expected  to  fall  significantly, 
estimated to decrease at about 1.5 percent for every 
degree that temperatures rise above 25°C.103 

Climate  is  also  impacting  fashion’s  logistic 
strategies.  Across  all  industries,  90  percent  of 
exported goods are reliant on shipping to reach their 
final  destinations,  but  an  estimated  $122  billion  of 
economic activity at ports is at risk from disruptions 
caused by extreme climate events.104 105 The summer 
of  2023  saw  Europe’s  worst  dry  spell  in  500  years, 
with  ships  navigating  the  Rhine  River  forced  to 
reduce  the  weight  of  cargo  in  order  to  continue 
their journeys. A similar narrative played out on the 
Panama  Canal.  In  China,  drought  slowed  traffic  on 
the Yangtze River, forcing companies to move goods 
through alternative, often more expensive routes.106 

prioritising  worker  health  and  safety.  This  can  be 
actioned through operational shifts such as offering 
more  frequent  breaks,  rehydration  amenities  and 
proactive  temperature  monitoring  of  the  factory 
floor, alongside capital investments in fan systems.

Longer  term,  and  most  importantly,  companies 
should  invest  in  innovation  across  the  value  chain 
aimed  at  helping  to  reduce  fashion’s  impact  on  the 
planet. This will touch on all areas of the value chain, 
from  new  material  innovations  such  as  lab-grown 
fibres,  more  efficient  and  ethical  product  reuse  and 
recycling,  and  a  shift  from  encouraging  make-take-
waste consumption culture. 

Industry-wide 

initiatives  will  be  crucial  to 
facilitate  progress  at  scale.  Joining  pacts  such 
as  the  Fashion  Pact,  the  Sustainable  Apparel 
Coalition  and  the  Fashion  Charter  is  a  strong  first 
step,  but  action  must  follow  alignment.  Individual 
company  adaptation  should  be  supported  by  urgent 
collaborative change.

Consumers are gearing up for the biggest year 
of travel since before the pandemic. But a shift 
in values means travellers have a different set of 
expectations, even as shopping remains high on 
the agenda. Brands and retailers should consider 
refreshing distribution and category strategies to 
meet travellers wherever they are.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  Global travel is projected to exceed pre-pandemic flows for the 
first time in 2024, reaching up to 110 percent of 2019 levels. 

•  80 percent of consumers surveyed in the US, UK and China 

expect to shop for fashion while travelling in 2024, with 28 percent 
planning to spend more than the previous year, according to the 
BoF-McKinsey State of Fashion 2024 Consumer Survey. 

•  More than half of respondents are seeking destinations they 

haven’t visited before, including second-tier cities.

In  the  aftermath  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic, 
consumers  around  the  world  have  embraced  travel 
with a new fervour. Despite cost-of-living pressures 
and  economic  uncertainties,  global  travel  flows 
(calculated  as  the  total  number  of  kilometres 
travelled by paying airline passengers) are projected 
to  return  to  100  percent  of  pre-pandemic  levels  in 
2023 and reach between 105 percent and 110 percent 
in 2024, according to McKinsey analysis.107

A  fundamental  change  of  lifestyles  adopted  in 
recent years is helping to fuel this rise. For example, 
remote  and  hybrid  work  are  more  entrenched  than 
they  were  pre-pandemic.  A  growing  number  of 
workers  are  no  longer  tethered  to  offices.  In  the 
US,  only  39  percent  of  companies  now  require  staff 
to  work  from  their  offices  full  time,  down  from  49 
percent at the start of 2023, according to workplace 
provider  Scoop’s  Flex  Index,  which  predicts  the 
number  to  fall  to  15  percent  in  the  coming  years.108 
travellers  are  extending 
Meanwhile,  business

phenomenon  that  combines  business  with  leisure. 
Business travellers in the US, Europe and Asia take 
on  average  six  “workation”  trips  annually,  with  29 
percent  of  these  trips  to  international  destinations, 
according to travel-agency specialist Travel Edge.109

For  many  consumers,  travelling  and  shopping 
go  hand  in  hand.  Leading  players  like  LVMH  and 
Kering  have  cited  tourists,  specifically  Americans 
in  Europe,  as  a  key  driver  of  increased    sales  in  the 
first  half  of  2023,  which  grew  47  percent  and  53 
percent respectively.111 Moreover, the BoF-McKinsey 
State  of  Fashion  2024  Consumer  Survey  found  that 
80  percent  of  global  respondents  expect  to  shop  for 
clothes, footwear and accessories while travelling in 
the  year  ahead,  with  28  percent  expecting  to  spend 
more  than  the  previous  year  while  travelling.112  For 
brands and retailers, these travelling consumers will 
provide new growth opportunities.

Pushing the Boundaries

Revival of Experiences 

The  world’s  capital  cities  will  remain  popular  for 
world-class  shopping.  Paris,  for  example,  has  seen 
a  notable  spike  in  tourism  in  2023  with  numbers 
approaching those in 2019. Nearly 12 million tourists 
visited  the  city  between  January  and  April  2023, 
representing a 27 percent year-on-year increase and 
only 2.5 percent down on 2019 levels.113 London has 
also  seen  a  surge  —  two  million  more  international 
visitors  are  forecast  to  arrive  in  the  city  in  2023, 
compared with the year prior.114 

But  now,  many  travellers  are  also  looking  to 
expand  their  itineraries  beyond  these  traditional 
destinations.  Over  half  of  the  respondents  to  the 
BoF-McKinsey  consumer  survey  said  they  are 
seeking  destinations  they  haven’t  visited  before  in 
the year ahead, perhaps as a nod to a post-pandemic 
desire for freedom and escapism.115 Smaller cities like 
Edinburgh,  Scotland;  Lisbon,  Portugal;  or  Osaka, 
Japan,  have  witnessed  surging  popularity  this  year,

Providing  differentiating  experiences 
important.  According 
agency 
to  marketing 
Razorfish,  40  percent  of  travellers  are  willing  to 
spend half or more of their travel budget on a highly 
curated  moment  or  experience.123  While  pop-ups 
have  been  part  of  fashion’s  playbook  for  some  time, 
brands are increasingly expanding these experiences 
into  adjacent  categories  such  as  food,  nature  and 
wellness.  In  2023,  these  have  ranged  from  Prada’s 
pop-up café in London’s Harrods department store to 
resort-based rollouts like Fendi’s,124 which extended 
the  luxury  fashion  brand’s  aesthetics  to  design  a 
beach  club  for  the  Puente  Romano  Beach  Resort  in 
Marbella, Spain, featuring personalised sailing boats 
for guests of the luxury Costa del Sol destination.125 
Loro  Piana’s  La  Réserve  à  la  Plage  in  Saint-Tropez, 
France — consisting of a beach club and boutique — is 
another example.126

And  as  customers’  travel  itineraries  expand 
geographically, so too will pop-up ventures. Consider 

Now, many travellers are also looking to expand their 
itineraries beyond traditional destinations ... perhaps as a nod 
to a post-pandemic desire for freedom and escapism.

sightseeing,  culture,  local  dining  and  nightlife  as 
well as local shopping.116 117 “Set-jetting” destinations 
inspired  by  television  and  film  are  also  resonating 
with travellers — consider what the series “The Game 
of  Thrones”  has  done  for  tourism  in  Dubrovnik  on 
the Adriatic coast of Croatia.118

While  travel  itineraries  are  being  redrawn, 
some  brands  are  already  adjusting  where  and  how 
they connect with shoppers. In some cases, this has 
meant  expanding  store  networks  into  second-tier 
cities. Uniqlo has been focusing on accelerating new 
openings, including plans for a store in Scotland, on 
Edinburgh’s  Princes  Street,  in  2024.119  Edinburgh, 
too, has been in Chanel’s line of sight as it opened its 
first Scottish pop-up in the city this past summer.120 
In other cases, it has meant capitalising on trending 
locations  from  popular  culture.  This  is  what  Louis 
Vuitton  did  in  Taormina,  Sicily,  where  it  opened  a 
branded café and boutique in 2023 after the hilltop 
town  served  as  the  backdrop  of  the  hit  series,  
“The White Lotus.”121 122 

launched 

Dior’s  Dioriviera,  which 
in  2018  to 
showcase the brand’s annual beach collection in a few 
select  destinations.127  By  summer  2023,  Dioriviera 
had  reached  nearly  two  dozen  pop-up  and  concept 
shop locations, extending beyond iconic spots such as 
Beverly Hills, Saint-Tropez and Capri, setting up shop 
further  East  in  places  like  Bali  and  Phuket.128  129  130 
Meanwhile, Coach launched its first Coach Airways-
themed  pop-up  in  Malacca,  Malaysia  featuring  a 
concept  store  and  café  housed  in  a  Boeing  747  jet, 
selling ready-to-wear, bags and travel accessories.131

Fashion is also joining forces with hospitality to 
reimagine  experiences  for  travellers.  For  example, 
the  Four  Seasons  Hotel  in  Houston,  Texas  and 
fashion membership club Vivrelle have partnered to 
offer hotel guests complimentary access to an on-site 
luxury  “closet”  of  brands  such  as  Prada,  Gucci  and 
Dior.132  Saks  Fifth  Avenue  has  also  rolled  out  Fifth 
Avenue  club  concepts  that  offer  personal  styling, 
trunk  shows  and  special  events  at  various  Ritz-
Carlton and St Regis hotels.133

Get Packing

The new travel era also has implications for category 
preferences.  With  the  BoF-McKinsey  consumer 
survey  finding  that  nearly  40  percent  of  consumers 
purchase  new  clothing  to  wear  on  their  vacations, 
resort  fashion  is  a  key  beneficiary  of  travel’s 
growth,134 135 spurring the appeal of bright, summery 
labels  ranging  from  Australia’s  Zimmermann  to 
Brazil’s Farm Rio,136 137 as well as sales in the vacation 
category  from  luxury  e-tailers  such  as  MyTheresa, 
whose  vacation  category  sales  in  2022  were  triple 
2019 levels.138

Luxury  brands  have  launched  or  refreshed 
resortwear  collections,  often  aiming  to  attract  new 
customers  at  more  accessible  prices.  For  example, 
LVMH-owned Loewe — one of Lyst’s hottest brands 
of  the  year  —  has  continued  to  expand  its  Paula’s 
Ibiza  vacation  line,  riding  on  the  success  of  its 
popular totes made from woven palm leaves.139 140 But 
resortwear is not just confined to luxury houses. In 
the  mass  segment,  for  example,  Mango  launched  a 
designer collaboration in 2023 with California-based 
lifestyle  brand  Simon  Miller  to  create  a  colourful 

capsule beachwear collection.141 

Beyond  the  collections  themselves,  succeeding 
in  resortwear  requires  creative  approaches  to 
marketing,  such  as  influencer  trips  and  buzzy  local 
activations.  Recent  launches  of  ready-to-wear  lines 
reflecting the spirit of travel include Louis Vuitton’s 
LV By the Pool, with a branded activation at the iconic 
Zuma restaurant in Mykonos, Greece, and Versace’s 
La Vacanza in collaboration with musician Dua Lipa, 
which debuted in the south of France.142 143

For  fashion  executives,  travel’s  rebound  creates 
an opportunity to view their global growth maps with 
a new lens. As their customers seek out more unique, 
off-the-beaten-path  experiences,  fashion  players 
identify  emerging 
should  consider  proactively 
hotspots, while innovating marketing initiatives and 
piloting activations that resonate with 2024’s travel 
zeitgeist. Partnerships with adjacent industries, such 
as  travel  adventure,  hotels,  spas  and  restaurants, 
can enable brands and retailers to create compelling 
blended experiences no matter where customers find 
themselves. Overall, the key will be to keep pace with 
global customers, adapting to when, where and how 
they want to shop when on the road.

How China’s 
Tourists Will 
Return in 2024

By Daniel Zipser, Asina de Branche, Steve Saxon, Jackey Yu and Liann Wu

In 2024, Chinese tourists are set to return 
overseas, as outbound flows and spending 
gradually return to near pre-pandemic levels. 
However, evolving preferences and behaviours 
adopted throughout the pandemic years mean 
visitors from China will likely travel and shop 
differently than before.

For  more  than  two  decades,  outbound  travel 
from  mainland  China  was  a  major  catalyst  for  the 
growth of global tourism. In 2019, China accounted 
for  one-fifth  of  international  tourism  spending, 
amounting  to  $255  billion  as  the  result  of  a  total  of 
166  million  outbound  trips.144  However,  this  growth 
engine  came  to  a  halt  with  the  Covid-19  pandemic 
and the ensuing lockdowns.

After  three  years  of  restrictions,  mainland 
Chinese  consumers  are  getting  ready  for  new 
travel  adventures.  For  fashion  brands  and  retailers 
around  the  world,  the  return  of  China  tourism 
is  a  welcome  silver  lining  to  the  current  clouds 
hanging  over  the  country’s  economy.  However, 
to  maximise  the  opportunity,  companies  need  to 
prepare for consumers with different behaviours and 
expectations than pre-pandemic.

Domestic Strength

With  international  borders  closed  through  the 

pandemic,  domestic  travel  has  thrived  in  mainland 
China,  currently  on  track  to  exceed  pre-pandemic 
levels  in  2023.145  Despite  the  current  economic 
uncertainty  affecting 
the  country,  consumers’ 
willingness  to  travel  is  robust.  McKinsey  consumer 
research in Q3 2023 shows that travel is the category 
Chinese  consumers  are  most  likely  to  splurge  on, 
exceeding  other categories such as restaurants and 
groceries.146  During  the  country’s  eight-day  Golden 
Week  holiday  in  October  2023,  the  Chinese  took 
nearly 826 million domestic trips, up over 70 percent 
from last year.147 In 2024, this domestic momentum 
is  expected  to  continue,  with  mainland  travel  
flows  reaching  110  percent  to  120  percent  of 
pre-pandemic levels. 

is 

One  major  reason  for  the  strength  of  domestic 
tourism 
local  destinations  have  become 
increasingly  attractive.  Hainan  has  emerged  as  a 
top  hotspot  for  tax-free  shopping,  where  fashion 
sales  in  April  2023  were  203  percent  higher  than

pre-pandemic  levels.148  The  island  is  set  to  become 
one  of  the  world’s  largest  luxury  retail  markets  in 
the next five years and is expected to attract over 80 
million  visitors  annually.  In  October  2023,  luxury 
travel retailer DFS announced a major project — its 
largest  ever  —  to  build  a  “world-class,  seven-star” 
luxury  retail  and  entertainment  destination  in 
Hainan’s  Yalong  Bay  by  2026  that  will  cover  more 
than  128,000  square  metres  and  attract  over  1,000 
luxury brands.149

Outside  of  Hainan,  retail  in  the  mainland  has 
improved significantly as well. Top brands including 
Hermès,  Dior,  Chanel  and  Louis  Vuitton  invested 
heavily  in  their  domestic  footprints  during  the 
pandemic  by  renovating  flagship  stores,  opening 
VIP salons and strengthening sales associate teams 
to cater to local clientele.150 Luxury has also entered 
domestic  airports  for  the  first  time  —  in  September 
2023,  DFS  entered  the  domestic  terminal  at 
Chongqing  airport  with  a  line-up  of  brands  such  as 

Bulgari,  Valentino  and  Versace.151  Higher  duty-free 
allowances on e-commerce purchases and the price 
parity  of  brands  with  markets  abroad  decreasing 
from  up  to  50  percent  in  the  late  2010s  to  between 
10  percent  and  20  percent  today,  also  incentivise 
domestic spending.152

Given  strong  domestic  options,  experts  forecast 
a  permanent  repatriation  of  luxury  spend.  While 
China’s  460  billion  yuan  ($63  billion)  personal 
luxury  market  will  continue  to  grow  in  the  long 
term, domestic shopping may account for 60 percent 
to  70  percent  of  the  spend  (and  international  30 
percent to 40 percent). McKinsey analysis indicates 
a  likely  permanent  reversal  from  pre-pandemic 
levels  of  about  40  percent  domestic  and  60  percent 
international.153

Outbound Returns

While domestic travel continues to surge, 2024 will 
also  see  the  long-awaited  renaissance  of  Chinese

outbound travel. Outbound travel from the mainland 
is  recovering  quickly,  and  may  grow  from  almost  0 
percent of pre-pandemic levels in 2022 to 50 percent 
in 2023, with potential to almost double to 70 percent 
to  100  percent  in  2024.  A  full  recovery  could  take 
place by the end of 2024 or early 2025.154

What  will  drive  outbound  recovery  among 
Chinese  consumers?  Primarily,  there  is  a  burning 
desire  to  go  out  and  explore  further  afield  again. 
During the October Golden Week holiday, demand for 
Alibaba’s  Fliggy  visa  processing  services  were  over 
70  percent  higher  than  May  Day,  China’s  last  major 
national holiday. The number of outbound bookings 
also hit a high for the year. Moreover, travel interest 
spans both business and leisure.155 Some 39 percent 
of  respondents  from  the  latest  BoF-McKinsey  State 
of  Fashion  2024  Consumer  Survey  plan  to  travel 
more  internationally  for  personal  reasons,  while  34 
percent plan to travel more for business reasons.156

On  the  supply  side,  barriers  to  outbound  travel 
are  also  falling,  leading  to  increased  flight  capacity. 
Total  seats  in  September  2023  reached  over  50 

(58 percent) and sightseeing (57 percent). Shopping, 
meanwhile, is in seventh position.161  

While  the  shifting  demand  landscape  suggests 
big shopping hauls are lower on the list vis-à-vis other 
activities,  shopping  data  from  tourism  tax  refund 
company Global Blue points to spending on shopping 
still being on track to recover in force. This year, in 
Asia Pacific, the shopping spend of mainland Chinese 
tourists is already 109 percent of 2019 levels. This has 
been  driven  by  a  significant  increase  in  the  average 
spend per shopper.162

In  continental  Europe,  the  shopping  recovery 
has  been  slower,  with  like-for-like  in-store  sales  to 
mainland  Chinese  tourists  reaching  41  percent  of 
pre-pandemic levels, despite a 54 percent jump in air 
capacity.163  Leading  the  recovery  are  ultra-high-
net-worth individuals, who are spending 28 percent 
more  per  transaction  on  average.164  According  to 
Jean-Marc  Bellaiche,  the  chief  executive  of  French 
luxury  retailer  Printemps,  most  business  this  year 
has  been  from  individual  clients  at  a  much  higher 
level  compared  to  pre-Covid,  while  group  travel  — 

In 2023, in Asia Pacific, the shopping spend of mainland 
Chinese tourists is already 109 percent of 2019 levels.

percent of pre-pandemic levels and have consistently 
risen week on week.157 Regulatory hurdles have also 
eased as travel bans to more than 170 countries have 
been  lifted,  adding  momentum  to  the  recovery.158 
The  regions  that  will  likely  benefit  immediately  are 
those that are easiest logistically to get to, including 
other East Asian countries and Southeast Asia — over 
40  percent  of  surveyed  consumers  have  expressed 
interest  in  travelling  to  these  regions  in  2024.159 
Outside of the “four-hour flight circle” around China, 
tourism  is  also  picking  up  in  Australia  and  New 
Zealand,  United  Arab  Emirates,  Turkey  and  Egypt, 
according to Fliggy.160 

The Experience Imperative

For  Chinese  tourists  who  return  abroad,  there  has 
been a fundamental change in priorities. Much higher 
on  tourist  agendas  is  the  desire  for  experiences. 
According  to  the  BoF-McKinsey  consumer  survey, 
dining  out  and  trying  local  cuisine  are  the  most 
popular  travel  activities  (63  percent  expect  to  do 
more  on  the  next  trip),  followed  by  being  in  nature 

which represented nearly a third of sales in 2019 — is 
significantly down.165 Therefore, as travel normalises, 
European stores could expect a recovery of shopping 
spend  close  to  pre-pandemic  levels,  though  in  
the  near-term  driven  by  value  of  shoppers  rather 
than volume. 

New Shopping Priorities

When  it  comes  to  shopping,  Chinese  travellers  now 
have  a  more  sophisticated  set  of  expectations  than 
before the pandemic. To start, in-store experience is 
a top priority. This is especially true in luxury: In the 
latest  McKinsey  China  Luxury  Consumer  Survey, 
81  percent  of  consumers  said  they  want  to  touch 
and feel products, regardless of the initial discovery 
channel.166  This  means  they  now  look  for  elevated 
in-store experiences, full assortments, deep product 
education and immersive interactions.

Digital  expectations  have  also  matured,  as 
61  percent  of  Chinese  luxury  consumers  are  true 
omnichannel  shoppers.167  This  means  they  are 
more  likely  to  engage  with  brands  that  can  interact

hyper-digitised consumers. 

Third,  brands  and  retailers  should  consider 
revamping  their  assortments  to  reflect  the  updated 
tastes  of 
the  Chinese  consumer.  Successful 
companies will pivot towards categories such as fine 
watches  and  jewellery  for  affluent  shoppers  seeking 
safe-haven  indulgences  and  niche  products  for  the 
individualistic younger generation that will become 
the future face of Chinese consumers.

Lastly, as global brands and retailers strive to win 
back the Chinese shopper, they must not lose sight of 
other  key  demographics  like  American  and  Middle 
Eastern shoppers who play a large role in the market. 
Achieving  success 
in  serving  diverse  clientele 
while  making  the  most  of  this  unique  Chinese 
opportunity  demands  thoughtful,  targeted  moves 
and  commitment  to  creating  inclusive  experiences 
that cater to a wide range of tastes and preferences.

through  familiar  digital  ecosystems  with  features 
such  as  scheduling  appointments  with  Mandarin-
speaking associates, WeChat loyalty programmes as 
well as personalised communications and services. 

Category  preferences  have  evolved.  In  personal 
luxury, jewellery and watches are expected to gain 4 
percentage points of share of discretionary spending 
between 2023 and 2027, having overtaken handbags 
as the top-spending category in 2023. One reason is 
the  belief  that  hard  goods  are  more  likely  to  retain 
their  value  in  an  uncertain  economic  environment 
than other categories. Ready-to-wear is expected to 
lose 2 percentage points of share from 2023 to 2027.168

consumers consider in a purchase, brand names fell

five in 2022. And 31 percent of Gen-Z (age 16 to 23) are 
open to smaller brands, compared to just 22 percent 
of Gen-X (39 to 54).169

How Should Brands and Retailers Respond?

Now is the time for brands and retailers to proactively 
prepare for the return of the world’s largest outbound 
travel population. This means strategically balancing 
domestic  and  international  needs  and  tailoring 
shopping  experiences  to  new  expectations  and 
preferences.

First,  higher  standards  for  in-store  experience 
consider  maintaining

exceptional  retail 
locations  such 
as  Hainan  or  mainland  cities,  while  deploying 
investments in key international hubs popular among 
Chinese  travellers.  This  means  creating  shopping 
spaces that offer elevated comfort and convenience, 
alongside exclusive VIP services in destinations such 
as  the  Ginza  neighbourhood  in  Tokyo  or  famous 
department  stores  such  as  Galeries  Lafayette  or  La 
Samaritaine in Paris. 

Second, retailers awaiting the Chinese consumer 
could rethink their digital playbooks to link with the 
latest  Chinese  ecosystems,  integrating  a  personal 
touch  and  tailored  offerings  into  Chinese  apps  
such  as  WeChat.  Partnering  with  key  opinion  
leaders  (KOLs)  and  other  influencers  on  social 
platforms  such  as  Xiaohongshu  or  Douyin  will 
also  help  drive  awareness  and  engagement  with

The New Face
of Influence

It’s time for brand marketers to update their influencer 
playbooks. A new guard of creative personalities 
is gaining brands’ attention, winning trust and 
fandom among key audiences. Working with these 
personalities in 2024 will require a different type of 
partnership, an emphasis on video and a willingness 
to relinquish a degree of creative control.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  68 percent of consumers feel bothered by the amount of 

sponsored content on social media and 65 percent rely less on 
fashion influencers compared to previous years.

•  Consumers increasingly demand authenticity, entertainment 

and relatable personalities, unlocking a “new wave” of creators 
who embrace less-polished aesthetics, quirkiness, humour and 
vulnerability.

•  To capture and hold the attention of consumers online in 2024, 

fashion marketers will likely break free of tried-and-tested routines 
and explore new avenues for partnering with creators.

to be a powerful channel for brands to break through 
the  noise  and  connect  with  consumers,  with  the 
influencer-marketing  industry  forecast  to  reach 
$21.1 billion in 2023, up from $16.4 billion in 2022.173 
However, the influencer landscape has been evolving 
in  the  past  few  years  as  consumers  increasingly 
demand  authenticity,  entertainment  and  relatable 
personalities,  with  this  trend 
likely  to  gather 
momentum in the year ahead. 

According to the BoF-McKinsey consumer survey, 
consumers  are  gravitating  towards  relatable  and 
authentic influencers far more than other attributes

such  as  an  aspirational  lifestyle  or  celebrity  status. 
Marketing  and  influencer  firms  echo  these  findings 
— a 2023 survey found that, although beautiful and 
aspirational content was effective, social media users 
were  more  likely  to  follow  influencers  whom  they 
deem authentic and fun.174

The  changing  dynamics  are  reflected  in  where 
users spend their time online. TikTok, often regarded 
as a platform that promotes authenticity,175 has taken 
the lead among some user groups. A March 2023 study 
estimated  that  US  adults  spent  nearly  56  minutes  a 
day on average on TikTok. By comparison, US adults 
spent just over 30 minutes on average on Instagram.176 
TikTok’s success, which has prompted Instagram to 
emulate the platform with its Reels video feature,177 is 
based largely on how it surfaces content, emphasising 
measures such as the time users spend on a post and 
whether they return.178 As a result, any creative and 
entertaining content can reach a wide audience, even 
if the creator doesn’t have a high number of followers. 
The  platform  BeReal,  meanwhile,  saw  surging  user 
growth  in  2022,  and  while  there  are  doubts  about 
its longevity,179 its emergence may well be a response 
to  the  perceived  inauthenticity  of  social  media’s  
large incumbents.

more  pronounced  as  influencers  emphasise  their 
individuality.  Gen-Z  in  particular  value  pursuing 
their own unique identities and appreciate diversity 
among  other  attributes,  according  to  a  Stanford 
University  study.180  This  generation’s 
favourite 
platform  for  following  influencers  is  TikTok,181 
which  was  also  deemed  the  best  platform  by  Gen-Z 
respondents  for  promoting  a  product  through 
influencers  in  a  2022  survey,  surpassing  both 
YouTube and Instagram.182

While  traditional  influencers  who  convey  an 
aspirational  lifestyle  and  command  large  audiences 
are likely to remain important for fashion marketing, 
other influencers who come across as less scripted or 
polished  are  already  gaining  audiences.  Quirkiness, 
humour  and  vulnerability  are  helping  this  cohort 
stand  out.  A  case  in  point  is  Alix  Earle,  who  has 
built  a  following  of  nearly  6  million  on  TikTok, 
not  with  any  sort  of  viral  hit  but  rather  with  her 
apparent relatability and willingness to be herself.183 
Madeline  Argy’s  TikTok  confessionals,  which 
take  the  form  of  funny,  rapid-fire  videos  such  as  a 
tearful  questioning  of  what  DJs  actually  do,  have 
earned her roughly 5 million followers. And Sabrina 
Bahsoon, who goes by Tube Girl, shot to fame posting 
TikTok  videos  showing  her  dancing  in  the  London 
Underground, an act that’s been called “unapologetic 
self-expression.”184

While  the  styles  of  these  creators  differ,  what

unites them is their off-beat, personal approaches to 
creating  content,  which  reads  as  being  authentic  to 
who they are rather than pursued purely for “likes” or 
to  convey  an  unattainable  ideal.  The  most-followed 
personality on TikTok is Khaby Lame, whose content 
featuring  his  humorous  silent  commentary  on 
ridiculous  online  videos  has  attracted  roughly  162 
million followers. 

Fashion brands are embracing these personalities 
and  seeing  the  benefits.  Bahsoon  featured  in  Hugo 
Boss’ most-viewed TikTok post, which has garnered 
more  than  144  million  views.  Lame  and  Argy  have 
fashion partnerships as well. For the debut of creative 
director  Sabato  de  Sarno  in  September  2023,  Gucci 
asked  Amelia  Dimoldenberg,  who  became  popular 
conducting  awkward  interviews  at  a  fried-chicken 
establishment,  to  attend  the  event  and  interview 
other guests.

Brands are also going down the path of creating 
deeper  partnerships  with  influencers  than  one-off 
videos  or  fashion  show  invitations.  For  example, 
luxury brands Loro Piana and Audemars Piguet are

To  be  sure,  capturing  and  holding  the  attention 
of  consumers  online  in  2024  will  likely  require 
fashion  marketers  to  break  free  of  tried-and-
tested  initiatives.  In  addition  to  collaborating  with 
celebrities  and  mega-influencers,  they  may  also 
need  to  dedicate  resources  to  identify  talent  that  
might  not  be  on  their  current  radars  but  offers 
untapped possibilities.

When  creating  content,  brands  might  want  to 
look  beyond  highly  polished  product  promotions 
and  push  boundaries  by  developing  innovative  and 
surprising  campaigns  that  resonate  with  followers 
and  reach  new  audiences.  This  will  still  require 
campaigns  to  align  with  a  brand’s  core  image  and 
values.  In  its  own  guidance  to  brands,  TikTok 
recommends  creating  “actionable  entertainment” 
that holds users’ attention and can gain greater reach 
from the platform’s content algorithm, among other 
benefits.186 Brands should also consider incorporating

Audemars Piguet’s Tokyo launch of its collaboration

short videos and other popular social media formats. 
Because  some  of  the  most  successful  creators 
build  their  own  online  worlds,  brands  that  partner 
with them might want to empower them with a degree 
of creative control. Rather than simply gifting items 
or  sponsoring  posts,  they  can  collaborate  closely  to 
integrate  the  brand’s  presence  into  the  influencer’s 
content  style.  In  the  most  ideal  collaborations,  a 
brand  finds  an  avenue  to  convey  its  message  and 
perspective  in  a  manner  that  feels  seamless  and 
authentic. Gucci, for example, partnered with TikTok 
influencer Francis Bourgeois, who shares his passion 
for  trainspotting  with  his  followers,  in  campaigns 
such  as  the  latest  Gucci  Gift  and  fashion  week 
activations  inspired  by  the  scenic  countryside,  as  a 
way to convey the joy and nostalgia of train travel.

Of course, fashion businesses should still exercise 
diligence  to  minimise  potential  image  risks  when 
taking  new  creative  directions.  But  new  directions 
are also likely to lead to some of the greatest rewards.

EXECUTIVE INTERVIEW

Gstaad Guy: 
Catering to the 1% 
with Social Media Wit

By Tamison O’Connor

The Gstaad Guy’s online parodies of the ultra-
wealthy have blossomed into a full-time business 
for the pioneering influencer partnering with 
exclusive luxury brands for ultra-high-net-worth 
shoppers, highlighting how a niche genre of 
influencer marketing is helping to inject newness 
into how brands connect with their customers.

48

The State of Fashion 2024G staad Guy — who keeps 

his real identity a secret  
— began making a name 
for himself only a few years ago 
in niche social media circles by 
parodying the lives and tastes 
of the ultra-rich through sharp, 
satirical social commentary 
delivered through fictional 
personas: mainstay character 
Constance, an old-money British 
aristocrat who peppers his 
conversations with French and 
Italian and dresses head-to-toe 
in LVMH’s “quiet luxury” bastion 
brand Loro Piana, and guest-
star Colton, a happy-go-lucky, 
nouveau-riche Gen-Z  American. 
His humour is carefully targeted: 
many of Constance’s quips will sail 
far above the heads of the average 
Joe or Jane, but leave 1 percent 
of the wealthy, who are used to 
flitting between Gstaad, Monaco 
and London, chortling. (According 
to Forbes, a good chunk of its 
Billionaires List is among  
his following.) 

Equally, luxury fashion 
brands also get where Gstaad 
Guy is coming from — to the 
extent that several have entered 
into partnerships with the social 
media star. Loro Piana launched 
600 limited editions of its Open 
Knitted Walk shoes exclusively 
for Gstaad Guy followers; the 
collaboration sold out within 
hours and became the fastest-
selling product the brand had ever 
made, according to Forbes.

How did Gstaad Guy come about?

I was Facetiming [with] a close 
friend of mine, who has a place 
in Gstaad. He was complaining 
about something he shouldn’t be 
complaining about. I had never 
been there at the time, but I knew 

Consumer Shifts

a lot of things about it purely 
based on conversations with him. 
I filmed one video on Snapchat, 
making fun of things I’ve heard 
him say, while really dialing up the 
absurdity. I sent that video to his 
mum, all in character, this fictional 
character I coined Constance, 
inspired by my friend. His family 
and closest friends found the 
video hilarious. His mum sent it to 
all the Gstaad mums’ WhatsApp 
group chats, which went to 
different parents and students of 
the Le Rosey boarding school [in 
Switzerland]. And it then quickly 
trickled into Gstaad-frequenting 
Geneva, Monaco and London 
communities. 

My satirical social commentary 

would focus on things that are 
only really relatable to very few 
in Gstaad, Monaco, Geneva and 
Mayfair [in London]. By video 
five, I think I had maybe 4,000 

followers, I spoke about how 
Constance loves his Loro Piana 
vicuña gilet. A couple of weeks 
later, I was told by the salesperson 
at Loro Piana on Sloane Street 
that people have been coming into 
the store asking to buy the items 
I was wearing in my video. And all 
similar gilets had sold out.

I was accidentally selling 
dozens of products that cost about 
three grand, with under 5,000 
followers. This has never been 
done before; I knew it because I’ve 
been on the other side. [I thought] 
there’s really something here.

What is it about Gstaad Guy 
that attracts your target 
audience?

I was making fun of a place that’s 
very inconvenient to access 
through commercial means of 
transport. It is three hours away 
from any commercial airport. 

49

And it’s, frankly, too expensive 
and too quiet for someone to just 
stumble upon. So through travel 
inconvenience, unaffordability and 
the privacy of the Swiss mountains, 
Gstaad just attracts some of the 
world’s wealthiest people  — people 
that commute between their 
chalets in Gstaad, townhouses in 
London, chateaux in Saint-Tropez 
and boats on the Mediterranean. 
And because I was making jokes 
about them and the way they live 
their lives there, I was attracting 
them. 

In this influencer landscape 
that is so saturated, what’s the 
white space that you occupy?

I am in a very unique position, 
where I have, through fiction, 
created very authentic characters. 
People have a deep connection 
with the characters, likely because 
of how authentic to their values 
they are. Especially Constance. 
And because of the rather 
niche jokes I’m making. I have 
the highest concentration today 
of high-net-worth people of any 
social media page globally, who 
are being communicated things 
that are delivered lightly through 
tongue-in-cheek storytelling that’s 
very digestible.

What has your Gstaad Guy 
account led to in terms of 
business opportunities?

Gstaad Guy is an atypical account. 
With anything atypical, especially 
in the luxury world, you don’t sell 
it like you sell commodities. It’s 
not, ‘Hey, here’s my price, buy or 
leave it and move on.’ That’s bad 
for the buyer and the seller. In 
the world of luxury social-media 
marketing, selling ad space 
and having a very authentic 

50

partnership are two very different 
things.

For Gstaad Guy, I always had to 

have a “tasting” for my potential 
clients before they hired me as 
their chef. And the way I always 
played that game is: who is Gstaad 
Guy in real life? What are the 
products and items that he would 
actually love? And let me just talk 
about those things more and more. 
I never thought I would have the 
scale to convert the masses of 
voyeurs. And I still don’t think I do. 
But I know I have the storytelling 
abilities to convert and elevate 
customers of an existing brand to 
new, better products, and to an 
elevated perception of that brand. 
Slowly, through storytelling, I 

built a really strong connection 
with my audience around a very 
few, very high-end products, which 
are historically very difficult to 
market, and it gave the brands 
no choice but to work with me. I 
became their ambassador before 
they asked me to. I think that’s 
what every brand is looking for 
now. Ad space is readily available, 
but authentic connections with 
an audience are scarce. If you 
have the choice, who are you 
going to choose? Obviously, the 
person who has the most authentic 
connection with your brand and 
ideal customers, so it doesn’t seem 
like an ad in your face.

Historically, luxury has been 
very protective of the way that 
brands are communicated. 
Content poking fun at their 
top customer base was not 
something that they would have 
typically engaged with. What’s 
changed?

I think the only thing that’s 
changed is that it’s been digitised. 

The Gstaad Guy social posts. Gstaad Guy.

The State of Fashion 2024Consumer Shifts

If you look at the real conversion 
of top clients around a truly 
luxurious brand like Loro Piana, 
it was never happening in a 
magazine or on a billboard. It 
was always happening at a dinner 
table, among friends and like-
minded people. And the way the 
items were discussed was always 
through a passion for excellence 
[and] often through the delivery of 
comedy and relaxed nonchalance, 
as one does at a group dinner.
If you’re smart and you’ve 
made enough money to afford 
this stuff, you know that luxury 
is often ridiculous by design. Of 
course, the brands can’t say that, 
but the people at the dinner table 
can, and that’s happened for 
generations. … A brand can talk 

archetypes’ personalities and 
desires. Their conversations are so 
often about products, and why this 
product is better than the other. 
It really came as second nature to 
my content and storytelling. From 
my very first video, when I never 
had any commercial intentions 
or ideas, Constance was talking 
about his favourite restaurants, 
destinations, clothes and Loro 
Piana gilet. It never seemed 
inauthentic; I wasn’t talking about 
the art of yoga and all of a sudden 
selling toothpaste. I’ve just been 
expressing who my characters 
are, and how their buying desires 
are all intrinsically linked to 
their values and interests. Real 
life connoisseurs like Constance 
demand excellence in all 

The world’s obsession with scale 
is a bad one, and I learned that 
the hard way when I worked on a 
start-up before this. I raised a lot of 
money and all my investors said is, 
“scale, scale, scale,” and we ended 
up with two million users that we 
could not convert financially. If I 
had raised far less venture money 
instead, and had 300,000 users 
who were paying, that’s a much 
better position to be in. And then 
scale those paying customers very, 
very slowly and make something 
sustainable.

That’s the core of luxury. If 
you have few people who love 
your products and you just grow 
that sustainably, you can remain 
a luxury brand and you can get 
your customers on the ladder of 

In the world of luxury social-media marketing, 
selling ad space and having a very authentic 
partnership are two very different things.

about their excellences and about 
how and why they create, but … as 
a consumer, you don’t want to feel 
like you’re being sold something 
[and] during those off-the-record 
moments where the founders of 
the brands can talk to friends and 
to ideal customers, they can add 
that salt and pepper that makes 
it digestible, and that’s what I do. 
Digital salt and pepper.

What role do products play 
in your business, given that 
you are, first and foremost, 
creating content? There’s a lot 
of content that doesn’t have any 
reference necessarily to any 
products.

Consumerism is so deeply 
integrated in the core of my 

categories of their lives, regardless 
of price, and if it isn’t excellent, it’s 
à la poubelle.

Is that limiting the number of 
brands you can work with?

Absolutely, and I think that’s a 
great thing. I don’t want to become 
a walking billboard. I’d rather be 
authentic to the few things I love 
personally and the few things my 
characters love. Just like the real 
Gstaad Guy types. Constance isn’t 
fickle and he very rarely changes 
his shopping, travel or dining habits.

In your case, scale almost works 
against you because you want 
to speak to a small community. 
How do you think about this as 
you become more famous?

slow elevation. That’s really my 
ideal scenario — to continue to 
elevate the storytelling, elevate the 
product offering. … I intentionally 
stay away from a lot of viral 
moments on social media because 
that’s not me. I’ll sometimes use 
my Gen-Z hypebeast character 
Colton to provide contrast and
perspective. But Constance, the 
Gstaad Guy, is not fashion. He’s not 
a trend. Gstaad Guy is a constant. I 
don’t want him to give in to trends, 
I don’t want him to give in to 
fashion, because I want him to be 
timeless, that’s how Gstaad Guy is 
perceived.

Outdoors 
Reinvented

Technical outdoor wear has been propelled by 
consumers’ post-pandemic embrace of healthier 
lifestyles as well as “gorpcore,” and is likely to 
accelerate even further in 2024. More outdoor 
brands will likely launch lifestyle collections while 
lifestyle brands embed technical elements into 
collections, further blurring the lines between 
functionality and style.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  The recent reorientation of outdoor apparel and footwear into 

the everyday wardrobe means brands will forge ever-closer ties 
between style and utility.

•  Competition in 2024 may increase across price points and 

categories, with some outdoor brands skewing apparel towards 
the high end, while others look to shake-up footwear.

•  As the gorpcore trend cools, brands may begin to lean into 

toned-down, “quiet outdoor” fashion.

The State of Fashion 2024Consumer Shifts

One lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been 
soaring consumer interest in healthier lifestyles and 
nature-focused activities,187 like camping, hiking and 
boating. In the US, 82 percent of people said they had 
participated  in  such  outdoor  activities,  compared 
to 60 percent in 2020,188 while nearly half of survey 
respondents  in  the  UK  report  spending  more  time 
outdoors  than  prior  to  the  pandemic.189  In  China, 
by  the  end  of  2021,  more  than  400  million  people 
were  taking  part  in  outdoor  sports,190  and  between 
2021  and  2023,  the  search  volume  in  for  “outdoor” 
on  Chinese  marketplace  Tmall  surged    more  than  
600 percent.191  

This  is,  of  course,  good  news  for  outdoor 
sportswear  brands,  many  of  which  have  also  been 
riding  the  “gorpcore”  trend  that  has  picked  up 
steam  over  recent  years.  “Gorpcore”  is  a  colloquial 
term  for  trail-running  mix  (Good  Ol’  Raisins  and 
Peanuts).  Outdoor  enthusiasts  and  young  urbanites 
alike have been gravitating to gorpcore’s functional, 
outdoors-inspired  fashion,  such  as  shell  jackets 
and  hiking-style  sneakers.  In  2022,  revenues  for 
the  outdoor  category  were  24  percent  higher  than 
pre-pandemic  times,  drawing  attention  of  financial 
deal  makers.192  Outdoor  wear  has  been  a  highly 
active investment category since the pandemic, with 
deals  involving  brands  and  retailers  like  Moosejaw, 
Marathon Sports and Topo Athletic.193 194

Many of the fastest-growing sports brands of recent 
years  have  roots  in  outdoor  performance  but  have 
since transcended their core customer bases to attain  
widespread popularity. In July 2023, The North Face 
announced  its  10th  consecutive  quarter  of  double-
digit revenue growth,195 while Amer Sports, backed by 
a consortium led by Chinese sportswear giant Anta, 
has said it plans to scale Salomon and Arc’teryx, two 
of its brands that were born as niche ski and climbing 
brands, respectively.196

A similar evolution is taking place with technical 
and  trail  running  brands  such  as  Deckers-owned 
Hoka  and  On,  which  found  loyal  customers  within 
innovative, 
running  communities  before 
high-comfort  solutions  found  appeal  with  wider 
audiences.  On  reported  a  69  percent  year-on-year 
jump  in  revenue  to  $1.3  billion  for  2022,  exceeding 
analyst expectations, while Hoka is on track to hit $2 
billion in annual revenue.197 198

their 

Luxury  brands  also  have  a  toehold  in  the 
outdoors.  The  North  Face  and  Gucci  collaboration, 
unveiled  in  2021,  was  one  of  the  first  big  tie-ups 
between luxury and outdoors. Since then, a wave of  
performance-influenced 
footwear  collaborations 
have  followed,  including  those  from  On  and  Loewe, 
Hoka and Moncler, and barefoot shoe maker Vibram 
and Balenciaga.199 In terms of apparel, Jil Sander and 
Arc’teryx collaborated on a collection of sportswear-
infused  mountain  gear,200  while  Adidas  and 
Moncler  created  a  capsule  collection  of  puffers  and 
track  jackets.201  These  partnerships  have  elevated 
gorpcore,  while  celebrities  like  Kendall  Jenner  and 
Bella  Hadid  have  taken  to  combining  high  luxury 
fashion with outdoor wear and hiking shoes.

Mid-market brands have been heading outdoors, 
too: H&M’s summer 2023 “Move” collection featured 
water-repellent  parkas  and  convertible  hiking 
trousers, while Inditex’s loungewear and activewear 

53

 
brand  Oysho  launched  hiking  boots  within  its 
permanent  range  alongside  a  hiking  collection 
for  women.202  Free  People  similarly  expanded  its 
merchandise  to  include  hiking  sticks  and  trekking 
poles.203

In  the  year  ahead,  brands  are  expected  to  forge 
ever-closer ties between style and utility as lifestyle 
brands  deepen  investment  in  the  outdoors,  and 
outdoor  brands  increasingly  court  fashion-focused 
customers.

As  such,  outdoor  specialists  are  likely  to  more 
closely  align  their  products  to  everyday  lifestyles. 
Merrell,  which  started  as  a  purveyor  of  high-
performance  hiking  boots,  is  among  the  brands  to 
have developed lifestyle footwear,204 while Icelandic 
outerwear  brand  66°North  named  Kei  Toyoshima, 
a  menswear  design  consultant  at  Louis  Vuitton,  as 
creative director in 2022 to enhance its appeal with 
broader audiences.205

Meanwhile, luxury players from Dior to Burberry 
are  moving  from  one-off  outdoor  capsules  to 

Reflecting 

this  dynamic,  Arc’teryx 

chief 
executive  Stuart  Haselden  said  in  spring  2023  that 
the  company  is  investing  in  sub-brand  Veilance  to 
cater  to  consumers  looking  for  fashion-forward  yet 
minimalist  technical  clothing  without  the  typical 
gorpcore  hallmarks.208  Outerwear  label  Goldwin 
has  introduced  simple,  loose  suiting  made  from 
ultra-lightweight  wool  and  bamboo  fibre,209  while 
Roa  Hiking,  a  brand  favoured  by  rapper  Drake,  has 
married  a  luxury  aesthetic  with  functionality  with 
products such as thermal-lined trousers made from 
water-repellent nylon fabric.210

When  it  comes  to  footwear,  outdoor-style  shoes 
from  performance  brands  that  “sneakerheads” 
started  coveting  in  recent  years  are  likely  to  gain 
even more traction with consumers in 2024. On was 
the fastest-growing sneaker brand in 2023 on resale 
platform  StockX,  with  trade  activity  up  more  than 
15,000  percent  year  on  year,  while  trade  activity 
for  Salomon  and  Asics  was  up  202  percent  and  72 
 percent respectively.211

The challenge for all brands will be to establish relevancy among 
diverse customer segments, from technical outdoor-goers to 
StockX customers, while staying true to the brand’s core.

permanent collections. Prada’s Linea Rossa technical 
line  has  recently  been  sported  by  style  makers 
such  as  A$AP  Rocky.206  In  turn,  outdoor  labels 
have  started  to  borrow  from  the  luxury  playbook 
by,  for  example,  opening  high-profile  flagships  and 
pop-up  experiences  that  elevate  their  brands.  This 
includes  Arc’teryx’s  latest  flagship  store  in  Osaka’s 
Shinsaibashi  neighbourhood,  which  features  the 
first Arc’teryx cafe with food inspired by the brand’s 
Canadian roots, as well as a Japanese menu.207

Quieter Styles Ahead

However,  as  the  gorpcore  trend  cools,  brands  may 
be  challenged  to  shapeshift  their  outdoor  offerings. 
Similar  to  how  the  “quiet  luxury”  aesthetic  gained 
popularity as consumer interest in streetwear waned, 
“quiet outdoor” styles are likely to gain popularity in 
the  year  ahead,  with  consumer  preferences  shifting 
from flashy performance jackets and cargo trousers 
to  elevated  garments  with  minimal  logos  while  still 
featuring technical fabrics.

This may spur brands to lean further into styles 
that straddle utility and fashion and can be worn in 
both urban and outdoor settings. For example, one of 
Salomon’s top sellers is its Sportstyle XT-6 Gore-Tex 
shoe,  which  features  performance  benefits  but  is 
designed for use in daily life.212 The brand has teamed 
up  with  Maison  Margiela  to  launch  an  Autumn-
Winter  2023  collection  including  a  “Cross  Wader” 
trainer  which  bridges  technical  performance  and 
style,213  building  on  the  success  of  the  two  brands’ 
“Cross  Low”  sneaker  worn  by  Rihanna  at  the  2023 
Super Bowl.214

In  the  coming  year,  utility,  durability  and 
performance  may  prove  to  be  a  good  match  for 
consumers’  budgets,  increasing  the  appeal  of  the 
outdoor  category.  As  such,  brands  across  all  price 
segments should get ready to embrace the outdoors in 
its new, blended form and find a place in the shifting 
competitive landscape.

Indeed,  competition  may  increase  across  price 
points  and  categories,  with  some  outdoor  brands

skewing  apparel  towards  the  high  end  (Arc’teryx, 
The  North  Face)  and  capturing  some  of  luxury 
brands’  wallet  share,  while  others  look  to  further 
shake-up the footwear market (Hoka, On, Salomon). 
The  challenge  for  all  brands  will  be  to  establish 
relevancy  among  diverse  customer  segments,  from 
technical outdoor-goers to StockX customers, while 
staying  true  to  the  brand’s  core.  Otherwise,  brands 
may  risk  watering  down  their  identities  and  losing 
what makes them distinctive in the first place.

For  outdoor  brands  looking  to  conquer  fashion, 
embracing a quieter aesthetic may be the key. On the 
other  hand,  fashion  brands  making  their  foray  into 
outdoor  wear  may  be  able  to  crack  the  design  code  
but  may  have  to  rapidly  scale  capabilities  and 
suppliers  to  compete.  Redefining  the  go-to-market 
strategy  to  prioritise  innovation  and  extensive 
testing  of  materials  for  performance  will  likely 
become table stakes.

EXECUTIVE INTERVIEW

On: Capitalising 
on the Perennial 
Sportswear Boom

By Daniel-Yaw Miller

The co-founder and executive 
co-chairman of the Swiss 
performance-footwear and 
apparel brand, David Allemann, 
reflects on why performance 
sportswear companies can lean 
into innovation, technology and 
collaborative relationships with 
athletes to build credibility with 
outdoor-focused consumers.

David Allemann,  
Co-Founder and 
Executive Co-Chairman, 
On

The State of Fashion 2024 
 
 
The way David Allemann 

sees it, On’s expansion 
from geeky, high-tech 

running footwear into fashion-
forward sportswear is evolution, 
not revolution. Having co-founded 
the company in 2010 to make 
quirky-looking running shoes 
for top athletes and avid amateur 
runners215 — whose prototype 
made from cut-up garden hoses 
is still proudly on display at On’s 
Zurich headquarters — Allemann 
has seen how a performance brand 
like On can “naturally transition” 
into the wider world of fashion, 
while staying true to its sporting 
credentials. The key, he says, is 
credibility with consumers.

In the case of On, that “organic” 
ability had multiple implications — 
from distance running came trail

running and professional track and 
field, then to the pivotal moment 
in the company’s history when On 
entered into a partnership with 
tennis star-turned-investor Roger 
Federer in 2019, capturing the 
attention of not only gym-goers 
and hobbyist runners, but enabling 
it to continue expanding its global 
footprint and product mix, to 
generate a record net sales of 
1.22 billion Swiss francs ($1.36 
billion) in 2022, with apparel’s 
contribution to the top line steadily 
rising year on year.

With many consumers 

continuing to embrace 
performance wear as their 
everyday “uniform,” Allemann 
says there are plenty of growth 
opportunities for performance-
sport brands.

The sportswear category 
has become increasingly 
competitive, with newer  
entrants. But even as the market 
gets more crowded and 2023 
has been challenging generally, 
On continues to grow. How 
does the brand stay ahead and 
consistently build desirability? 

Generally, the performance-
sports space is a super interesting 
one where there is so much 
opportunity because we’ve just 
seen that massive channel shift of 
consumers, pretty much almost 
making performance and sports 
their new uniform. Driven by 
the fact that consumers now 
probably, on many days, are 
working from home and have it 
much easier to integrate sports 
and potentially even nature if it’s 
close by. ... In a sense, the market 
has become much bigger and 
we feel it’s because of the new 
uniform. I think this benefits every 
[brand] that comes from a true 
performance and sports core. 

In the case of On, we’ve been 

working very hard over the last 
13 years — it’s still a young brand 
— to build at the intersection of 
innovation, but also design and 
sustainability, because we feel 
if you get that formula right … I 
think you [can] be relevant for the 
consumer in this market.

How is the global consumer shift 
towards embracing the outdoors 
and healthy lifestyles impacting 
the sportswear category?  

Today it’s probably almost easier 
to come from sports into fashion 
than it is to go from fashion 
into sports, because so much 
[inspiration] is driven from 
performance technology and 

 
 
 
from performance silhouettes. Of 
course, you can create a sneaker  
coming from fashion, but it’s just 
much less credible. Also, if you think 
about membrane jackets, technical 

hoodies, track pants or even 
backpacks, these are now so big in 
fashion. But ultimately these are 
all silhouettes that are originally 
coming from the sports category to 

make sportswear the new uniform. 
If we look at fashion brands these 
days they almost feed on sports 
technology, whether it’s stretchable 
fabrics or closure systems.

Presumably, the barriers 
to entry to becoming a 
performance footwear brand 
are high, right? 

To start in footwear, you have 
to have high credibility when 
it comes to the technology and 
what uniqueness you bring to the 
market. That absolutely is not a 
given. I think we had this gem of 
technology that for the first time 
was not just a new foam, but was 
really an engineering piece that we 
brought to the market, and then 
having all the speciality retailers 
[selling our shoes] and seeing 
the benefits [of the technology], 
and also getting the whole 
buy-in of athletes in the Boston 
Marathon, like Hellen Obiri or the 
On Athletics Club that we built 
together with our athletes. 

On brings athletes into the core 
of its product development 
process. Since 2019, you’ve had 
a fruitful relationship with 
Roger and with the athletes in 
the On Athletics Club. Since 
then, there have been many 
examples of other performance 
brands working with athletes 
collaboratively. How important 
will this way of working with 
athletes be for the On brand 
going forward?  

For us, it’s always personal. When 
we’re building partnerships, it’s 
always a personal journey, and we 
really feel that the brand and the 
personality have to fit. We just feel 
so fortunate to have Roger, Iga 
[Świątek, winner of 2023’s French 

Roger Federer in ‘The Roger.’ On.

58

The State of Fashion 2024Open] and Ben [Shelton, winner 
of 2023’s Laver Cup in Vancouver, 
Canada] on board.  

Going back to the very origin of 
On. … When we started developing 
On, we always went to our 
— back-then — lab in a carpenter 
workshop and tested the shoes 
or the new outsoles out, together 
with our athlete friends. So it’s 
always been the case for On that 
innovation and athlete testing are 
intrinsically connected. 

It just happens now on a much 
bigger scale. So we’re building that 
scale and I feel the On Athletics 
Club has given us an opportunity 
to build almost a family of athletes, 
who sometimes live together, train 
together and are part of that On 
Athletics Club, but are of course 
also our daily testing ground of 
every innovation step we take. 
Iga is so involved in the 
development of her shoe that we 
keep iterating to make it even 
better, and so it’s actually quite a 
long process how we work together 
to get the best out of it. It’s at the 
very core of On, and it’s also not 
something where we’re basically 
saying, ‘Let’s bring in an athlete, 
let’s get some ideas,’ and then 
we do something together and 
we move to the next athlete. It’s 
long-term relationships.

How has On’s approach to 
launching its apparel category 
been evolving? 

It’s fantastic to have Tim 
[Coppens] on board [as our apparel 
designer since 2022]. Tim has, I 
think, this unique background, 
being originally a snowboarder 
and a skater, starting out with 
sports brands, then crossing over 
to fashion, then having his own 
fashion brand. We feel this duality 

Consumer Shifts

in DNA that is part of our success 
formula. Together with Tim, 
we have continued to build the 
apparel business for On. 

It is hitting exactly at that 

intersection where it’s with 
the most technical fabrics with 
ultralight membranes that win 
ISPO awards — very technical, but 
at the same time also accessible 
and versatile so that you can make 
it part of your uniform, whether 
you’re road running, whether you’re 
out on the trails, or whether 
you’re travelling. So our apparel 
addressed a range of activities 
across a very active lifestyle.

You’ve also probably observed 
how we’ve been opening our retail 
experiences around the world. 
There’s Regent Street [flagship 
store in London], but already 
more than 10 stores in China, as 
well as US stores including New 
York, LA and so on. Just to see how 
apparel is embraced in our retail 
experience again, gives us the feel 
that we’re hitting the right spot. So, 
for example, in some of our stores 
in China, apparel is already 20 
percent of the sales.

As a performance brand in the 
sportswear category in China, 
what is the On strategy for 
penetrating that market?

We started in China quite a while 
ago and it’s a fully Chinese team 
that sits in Shanghai. We’ve pretty 
much started the relationship with 
the China market as we started 
in a lot of the markets, where it’s 
really about grassroots and making 
sure that you’re doing fun runs, 
that we are connecting to the 
training community, which is very 
important in China as well, and 
that we’re also physically present, 
which is what we realised as in 

59

other big, big markets. You have 
to build that nucleus in different 
cities but you can’t go after the full 
market. So, in a similar sense, we 
started in the major hubs in the 
US and in London then [a pop-up 
store] in Liverpool in the UK. We 
started with Shanghai and Beijing 
and are expanding from there.

Building that community first 
is really important for us because 
the community is also what carries 
you. For us, it’s very much about our 
mission to ignite human spirit through 
movement. To have that movement, 
you have to have a community 
around you. That is at the core. 

Have you found any interesting 
differences between, say, the 
Chinese market and other 
markets? 

Yes. What we realised is that for 
example the speciality stores — 
the grassroots [speciality] retail 
partners that helped us grow 
across the rest of the world — exist 
less in China and so we realised 
that we have to, to a certain extent, 
build that on our own. That’s 
also why we have almost as many 
stores, or probably as many stores, 
opened in China alone as we have 
in the rest of the world. These 
[On] stores or retail experiences 
become a hub for building our 
community. Then a lot, of course, 
crosses over into the digital 
sphere. But [in China] you have to 
build that grassroots community 
yourself.

Gen AI’s Creative 
Crossroad

After generative AI’s breakout year in 2023, use 
cases are emerging across creative industries, 
including fashion. Capturing the value of this 
transformative technology in 2024 will require 
fashion players to look beyond automation and 
explore its potential to augment the work of 
human creatives.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  According to McKinsey analysis, as much as one-fourth of 

generative AI’s potential value in fashion may be driven by use 
cases in design and product development. 

•  73 percent of fashion executives said generative AI will be a 

priority for their businesses in 2024, but just 28 percent have tried 
using it in creative processes for design and product development.

•  Equity funding for generative AI-focused start-ups skyrocketed in 

2023, reaching $14.1 billion in the first half of the year alone.

Disruptive  technologies  in  the  workplace  generally 
fall  into  three  categories  —  those  that  enhance 
existing  skills  while  creating  new  ones;  those  that 
replace skills while reducing the need for others; and 
those that fall somewhere in between. So where does 
one  of  2023’s  buzziest  technologies216  —  generative 
artificial intelligence — fit? For creative teams in the 
fashion industry, the year ahead could help them find 
the answer.

Gen  AI  —  algorithms  pre-trained  on  large 
volumes of data such as text, images and code, often 
fine-tuned with other corporate data, that can create 
new, complex content — had a breakout year in 2023 
as  powerful  new  tools  hit  the  market.  By  January, 
two  months  after  its  launch,  ChatGPT  reached 
an  estimated  100  million  users,  a  record  pace  of 
growth  at  the  time.217  Multiple  platforms  and  tools 
have since entered the market, and a dizzying array  
of  start-ups  are  seeking  to  leverage  these,  while 
strong  open-source  alternatives  are  challenging 
proprietary models.

While  the  technology’s  use 

in 
many  industries,  it’s  accelerating.  If  its  trajectory 

is  nascent 

continues, it could be one of the most transformative 
technologies for the fashion industry in a long while. 
Early experiments have offered a promising start, but 
the transformative power of gen AI will become more 
evident as use cases move beyond one-off projects and 
become embedded within fashion’s value chain.218

The  overall  financial  impact  of  gen  AI  on  the 
industry  is  potentially  significant.  According  to 
recent  McKinsey  analysis,  as  much  as  one-fourth  
of the value is expected to be driven by use cases at 
the  design  and  product  development  stage  of  the 
value chain.219 

It’s  no  surprise  then  that  gen  AI  is  on  industry 
executives’  radars.  The  BoF-McKinsey  State  of 
Fashion  2024  Survey  of  global  fashion  executives 
found 73 percent of respondents said gen AI will be an 
important  priority  for  their  businesses  in  2024.  Yet 
while many are experimenting with the technology, 
just 28 percent said their businesses had tried it for 
design  and  product,  indicating  fashion  companies 
are not yet capturing its value in the creative process.

could  impact  jobs  and  workflows.  The  fashion

industry  has  also  seen  a  fair  share  of  technological 
enthusiasm that has swiftly sputtered — notably, the 
metaverse. Based on rate of progress and investment, 
however, gen AI is likely to offer a different story. The 
technology has more practical applications than the 
metaverse,  making  it  more  attractive  to  businesses 
and  investors.  Equity  funding  for  gen  AI-focused 
start-ups skyrocketed in 2023, reaching $14.1 billion 
in  the  first  half  of  the  year  alone,  compared  with 
$3.5  billion  in  2021  and  $2.5  billion  in  2022.220  A 
significant share of the surge was due to Microsoft’s 
January  announcement  of  its  $10  billion,  multiyear 
deal  with  OpenAI,  the  research  laboratory  behind 
ChatGPT.221  In  the  second  half  of  the  year,  Amazon 
announced  a  $4  billion  investment  in  the  artificial 
intelligence  start-up  Anthropic,  pushing  2023’s 
investments in gen AI even higher.222

A Range of Applications

Part  of  gen  AI’s  potential  lies  in  the  array  of  tasks 
to  which  it  can  be  applied,  and  fashion  businesses 
are already beginning to adopt it in several concrete 

ways. However, the focus so far has been on one-off 
use  cases  with  clear  advantages  when  it  comes  to 
cost,  efficiency  or  customer  experience,  rather  than 
those with potential for wider industry disruption. 

Online  shopping  assistance  is  one  area  where 
it  is  making  its  mark.223  Online  retailer  Zalando 
announced  the  launch  of  a  beta  ChatGPT-based 
natural  language-powered  shopping  assistant  in 
spring  2023  that  allows  a  visitor  to  its  site  to  ask 
questions  and  get  answers  as  well  as  customised 
product  recommendations.224  Kering,  Mercari  and 
Shopify have similarly introduced AI chatbots.225

Brands  using  the  technology  to  write  product 
descriptions for their sites include Snipes, a sneaker 
and  streetwear  retailer,  and  Adore  Me,  the  lingerie 
company  recently  acquired  by  Victoria’s  Secret. 
Shopify, meanwhile, has introduced a gen-AI writing 
assistant for merchants.226 227

Other brands have begun exploring gen AI tools 
in one-off creative and marketing projects.228 Ganni 
used  the  technology  at  its  Spring/Summer  2024 
runway  show  for  an  installation  that  let  guests  ask 

63

questions  and  receive  answers  reflecting  Ganni’s 
point  of  view.  Luxury  label  Casablanca  created  a 
campaign  for  its  Spring/Summer  2023  collection 
by  partnering  with  an  AI  artist  and  using  image 
generator  Midjourney.229  Casablanca 
creative 
director  Charaf  Tajer  said  human  talent  and 
creativity were required to produce the richly hued, 
stylised  campaign  set  against  a  desert  landscape  in 
Mexico.  But  he  also  acknowledged  efficiency  gains 
as a result of bypassing all the planning and costs of 
in-person photo shoots, among other benefits. 

By Design

Specific  gen  AI  deployments  like  Zalando’s  and 
Casablanca’s  have  piqued  the  interest  of  both  the 
wider  industry  and  consumers.  But  the  technology 
has  not  yet  been  systematically  scaled  beyond  pilot 
projects.  Ultimately,  the  greatest  value  may  lie  in 
using gen AI in an end-to-end way that enables and 
enhances creativity. 

Use  cases  may  differ  across  segments  of  the 
industry.  In  fast  fashion,  gen  AI  can  accelerate  the 

tools.232

Companies  developing  gen  AI  software  for 
fashion say the technology can reduce manual tasks 
that take days to mere hours or even seconds. AiDA 
(short  for  AI-based  Interactive  Design  Assistant) 
reportedly  can  produce  a  dozen  fashion  templates 
within  10  seconds.233  The  system  uploads  sketches, 
materials and colour palettes to a virtual mood board 
with the help of a tagging tool for accelerated product 
searches. AiDA then creates templates that designers 
can finesse and augment. Cala, a fashion supply chain 
interface that includes gen AI in its design tools, can 
help designers produce more than 100 sketches in a 
single day, according to co-founder Andrew Wyatt.

Curation is Key

In fashion, human skill and creativity often hold the 
key to brand differentiation. Rather than diminishing 
them, gen AI used properly can free designers from 
manual  tasks  to  focus  on  creative  work.  Human 
designers  will  remain  key,  while  gen  AI  will  enable 
their  roles  to  be  orientated  around  curation.  This

design  process,  injecting  more  agility  from  trend 
detection to product development and by leveraging 
analytics  data  to  rapidly  produce  large  numbers 
of  new  designs.  Meanwhile  in  luxury,  gen  AI  could 
become  an  additional  medium  in  the  designer’s 
repertoire,  allowing  them  to  experiment  with  rapid 
iterations,  compile  mood  boards  that  draw  from 
diverse  sources  and  curate  the  output.  It  can  equip 
less  technically  skilled  designers  with  the  ability  to 
visualise  their  concepts.  The  unexpected  results 
produced by AI tools can even provide inspiration.

Fashion  brands  Collina  Strada  and  Heliot  Emil 
have  leaned  into  this  space  to  craft  their  Spring/
Summer  2024  collections.  Both  fed  images  of 
previous  looks  into  a  gen-AI  tool  to  produce  new 
designs  that  could  be  refined  with  text  prompts.230 
Online retailer Revolve also used the technology for 
a  series  of  eye-catching,  colourful  billboards  and 
dropped  a  limited  capsule  collection  with  garments 
from the campaign, with further experiments under 
way.231 Meanwhile, Spanish brand Desigual launched 
an on-demand collection that was designed using AI

potential must be communicated clearly to creatives 
to  ensure  the  technology 
is  adopted  without 
undermining the role of the designer. 

As  the  number  of  gen  AI  adopters  in  fashion 
expands  and  the  technology  evolves,  it  will  require 
more  than  a  superficial  understanding  of  its  role  in 
enhancing and unlocking creativity. It holds exciting 
potential  for  companies  to  create  unique  gen  AI 
models that enable them to infuse their brand DNA 
across  design  processes,  rather  than  relying  on  the 
generic  output  of  image  generators.  For  creatives, 
success will hinge on the support and infrastructure 
of  their  ecosystems  that  enable  them  to  move  from 
manual  creators  to  true  creative  curators.  When 
implemented  effectively,  the  technology  can  benefit 
and  amplify  the  creative  process,  thus  augmenting 
human  capability,  while  retaining  the  artistic  skills 
and knowledge of designers. Ultimately, say experts, 
human-centred  innovation  will  likely  be  the  most 
important use of AI.234

The State of Fashion 2024 
 
Fashion System

Generative  AI  (gen  AI)  offers  a  plethora  of 
opportunities  to  build  new  capabilities  across  the 
fashion  value  chain,  from  inspiration  mood  boards 
to  marketing  campaigns  and  virtual  shopping 
assistants.  As  new  use  cases  emerge  and  the  stakes 
become higher, there is an opportunity for leadership 
teams  to  move  from  “thinking  to  doing,”  while 
retaining  a  human-centred  approach  tied  strongly 
to  brands’  core  values.  Forward-looking  companies 
may want to develop a playbook for executives, which 
could  help  them  navigate  the  new  technology  and 
guide them in effectively applying gen AI throughout 
their organisations.

Setting Priorities for Impact

In the rush to unlock gen AI’s potential, it would be 
easy  to  take  an  opportunistic  approach,  jumping 
into  applications  in  the  hope  that  some  of  them 
hit  the  mark.  More  productively,  senior  leaders 
and  their  organisations  can  focus  on  impact  to  the 
core  business  and  build  a  portfolio  of  use  cases 
that  offer  both  short-term  benefits  and  broader, 
more 
transformational  potential.  Establishing 
collaboration  early  on  between  business  and 
technology  functions  will  be  critical  when  deciding 
where  to  focus  and  when  identifying  funding  and 
assessing  feasibility.  While  initial  moves  will  likely 
fall  outside  “business  as  usual”  investment,  they 
can be integrated with broader tech and IT strategy 
investments in the next planning cycle.

Companies  have  been  making  fast  progress 
in  putting  gen  AI  into  action.  Amazon  is  testing 
AI-generated  customer  product  review  summaries 
on  its  homepage  to  help  customers  quickly  distil 
the high volumes of reviews.235 Google offers hyper-
realistic clothing try-on, using AI-generated clothes 
and  models.236  Across  the  fashion  and  luxury  value 
chain,  companies  will  likely  see  the  largest  profit 
gains from gen AI in product design and assortment, 
followed  by  content-focused  marketing,  and  sales 
and  customer  experience,  according  to  McKinsey 
forecasts.  Further  gains  are  likely  to  be  made  by 
increasing  productivity  in  organisational  support 
functions such as HR and finance.237 

To  maximise  the  gen  AI  opportunity,  executive 
teams  typically  need  to  deliver  early  impact  while 
laying  the  foundations  for  future  scale.  The  pace 
of  expansion  is  likely  to  depend  on  technology 

instance,  producing 
and  talent  readiness.  For 
AI-generated  marketing  materials  could  be  a  quick 
win for some organisations, while others might view 
this  as  a  longer-term  play  if  data  and  platforms  are 
not ready. Talent upskilling is often needed and can 
demand an accelerated approach to building learning 
journeys for current staff, targeted hiring and smart 
partnering.  Tech  and  talent  foundations  will,  of 
course,  need  investment  and  a  commitment  to  new 
ways of working.

Shaping Teams for Impact

Gen  AI  implementation  is  typically  a  team  activity. 
Teams  should  be  structured  around  sets  of 
opportunities and use cases, while close collaboration 
across  business  units  and  between  functions  (legal, 
risk,  HR,  finance)  and  technology  and  engineering 
teams  will  be  essential.  Internal  and  external 
recruiting  should  focus  on  the  skills  necessary  for 
important  use  cases,  shifting  from  a  role-centric  to 
a  skills-centric  model.  Consider  a  brand  that  seeks 
to use gen AI to personalise online ads to individual 
customers.  Required  skills  could  include  design, 
data analytics and prompt engineering. Such a team 
might comprise a product manager, marketing lead, 
copywriter,  designer,  data  scientist,  specialised 
engineers (machine learning, data, cloud) and a risk 
specialist.

A shared, central “control tower” can orchestrate 
and  choreograph  these  fast-moving  teams  —  giving 
them  the  support,  shared  skills  and  sustained 
funding.  A  council  of  senior  leaders  in  business, 
legal, tech and product roles can provide purposeful 
governance  that  balances  speed  and  risk.  Often 
AI-driven  initiatives  are  decentralised  and  siloed, 
which  can  limit  success.  A  central  team  could 
coordinate  organisation-wide  development  of  the 
technology  platform  and  set-up  guardrails  for  risk 
and  compliance,  enabling  faster  and  more  effective 
progress  through  centralised  coordination.  The 
central  team  could  also  preside  over  technical 
infrastructure, 
internal 
communications  and  change  management.  Finally, 
leaders  could  exhibit  an  open  and  exploratory 
mindset  and  help  teach  employees  how  gen  AI 
can  help  them  work  better.  Allaying  fears  while 
encouraging  hands-on  learning  is  likely  to  be  a  key  
to success.

Tech and Partnership Choices

While full outsourcing is rarely optimal, partnerships 
with  platforms,  tools  and  talent  providers  are  often 
part of brands’ plans for gen AI adoption. Given few 
businesses might have the resources to train models 
from  scratch,  we  see  two  main  approaches  to  tech 
delivery:  First,  brands  can  fine-tune  third-party 
foundation  models  (e.g.  from  Cohere,  Google  or 
OpenAI)  or  open-source  alternatives  like  those 
released  by  Mistral  or  Meta.  Second,  brands  can 
consider  deploying  specialised  applications  that 
build on existing foundation models but are tailored 
to  specific  uses  —  like  Jasper’s  marketing  content 
tools  or  Cala’s  AI-assisted  design  platform  that 
provides  creative  suggestions  and  converts  ideas  to 
production-ready  designs.238  239  Most  organisations 
will  need  a  blend  of  both.  Finally,  hard-to-find 

talent  may  be  provided  through  tech  partners  and 
vendors — but leaders will likely want to ensure they 
are  also  building  in-house  skills  and  knowledge  via  
these relationships.   

Partnerships  can  often  yield  faster  gen  AI 
adoption  by  unlocking  the  use  of  state-of-the  art 
applications  and  tools  that  accelerate 
impact.

Likewise,  gen  AI-based  software  applications  build

from  established  providers  (e.g.  Adobe’s  Firefly  for

such  as  CLO,  which  converts  ideas  to  production-

from  cloud  providers,  but  tech  teams  internally 
must  set  expectations  and  share  accountability. 
Quality assurance, including content moderation, is 
likely  to  be  an  ongoing  activity,  throughout  the  life 
of the model and after it is released into production. 
Ongoing  monitoring  of  model  performance  and 
output  will  likely  be  key  to  maintaining  high 
standards for any brand.  

Navigating  these  risks  can  enable  leaders  to 
pursue gen AI responsibly in a fast-changing world. 
Governance  will  need  to  be  flexible  and  ready  to 
adapt  at  speed.  Organisations  that  take  a  human-
centred  approach  —  considering  the  impact  of  gen 
AI  on  employees,  customers  and  communities,  and 
prioritising  user  needs  and  experiences  —  are  more 
likely to succeed. 

Scaling Up 

Gen  AI  is  redefining  the  art  of  the  possible.  Very 
rapidly  constraints  have  shifted  from  technology 
limitations to the creativity of leaders in applying it to 
their businesses. In this context, hands-on learning 
should be a goal of its own — and learning rates may 
soon  separate  winners  from  losers.  According  to  an 
International  Data  Corporation  report,  40  percent 
of worldwide retailers and brands are experimenting 
with gen AI, while 21 percent are investing in gen AI 
applications.244  Likewise,  over  the  next  three  years, 
up to 74 percent of retail and e-commerce companies 
plan to increase gen AI spending.245 

To  enable 

successful  employee  adoption, 
organisations  could  provide  training  programmes 
to  onboard  employees  and  offer  resources  that  help 
them use gen AI. Such programmes can help upskill 
employees and educate them on benefits, highlighting 
how gen AI can expand their capabilities and reduce 
repetitive tasks, rather than eradicate jobs.   

Leaders can set the tone. To help drive responsible 
gen  AI  adoption,  leaders  could  foster  creativity  by 
creating  psychologically  safe  environments  where 
users  feel  empowered  to  experiment  and  learn  by 
doing, while investing in internal communication and 
change management. While gen AI’s profit potential 
is  high,  the  challenge  of  bringing  these  possibilities 
to life is very much a human-centred one. 

needed  at  most  fashion  companies,  rather  than  one 
or two. 

In  one  example  of  a  fashion-tech  partnership, 
designer  Norma  Kamali  partnered  with  AI  creative 
studio Maison Meta to fine-tune gen AI models using 
content from the Kamali’s 56 years of designs. Kamali 
said she hopes to use gen AI to preserve her creative 
legacy and empower her brand’s future. She sees close 
collaboration with tech partners as a key to success, 
where  they  iterate  to  improve  tools  and  identify 
new  practical  applications  in  her  business.  Kamali 
completed  gen  AI  coursework  at  the  Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology to learn more about AI and to 
encourage her employees to experiment with AI tools 
in their daily work.242  

Navigating Risks

As  fashion  companies  embrace  the  potential  of  gen 
AI, balancing enthusiasm with caution is likely to be 
a  key  to  success.  Notable  areas  of  risk  include  bias, 
the  effect  on  creativity,  intellectual  property  rights 
and data protection.

Gen  AI  outputs  are  based  on  data  from  which 
they  are  trained,  and  biased  data  can  have  negative 
consequences  on  customers  and  other  audiences. 
Brands and their partners should carefully construct 
comprehensive  datasets  and  ensure  data  teams 
include  diverse  backgrounds  and  perspectives.  In 
addition,  while  gen  AI  can  augment  creativity,243 
overreliance  on  models  trained  exclusively  on  past 
designs  could  also  inhibit  creativity.  Designers 
can  instead  use  gen  AI  as  a  “thought  partner,” 
critically evaluating gen AI outputs as “inspiration,” 
experimenting with ideas and building on outputs to 
create net-new designs. 

Fashion  brands  and  designers  should  be 
especially careful of the risks related to intellectual 
property  (IP).  Foundation  models  are  trained  on 
massive  amounts  of  internet-sourced  data  and  IP. 
Organisations  should  consider  how  their  creative 
designs  are  shared  online,  as  they  could  be  used  to 
train external models. Likewise, without a watchful 
eye  on  licensing  terms,  third-party  models  could 
employ  an  organisation’s  data  and  IP  for  their  own 
use. Similarly, companies should ensure that they are 
not sharing confidential and customer-sensitive data 
with models and gen AI applications.  

Building  secure  and  scalable  IT  infrastructure 
is  imperative.  In  most  cases,  this  is  likely  to  come

Fast Fashion’s 
Power Plays

Fast-fashion competition will likely become even 
fiercer in the year ahead. Challengers, led by Shein 
and Temu, are changing tactics around price, customer 
experience and speed. Success for disruptors and 
incumbents will likely hinge on their ability to 
adapt to evolving consumer preferences, while 
navigating regulations that may impact the industry. 

KEY INSIGHTS

•  The third generation of fast-fashion companies have captured 

consumers’ attention. 40 percent of US consumers and 26 percent 
of UK consumers have shopped at Shein or Temu in the past 12 months.

•  The success of much of the third generation is underpinned by 

several operating model innovations that make fashion faster and 
cheaper than ever, including agile manufacturer-to-consumer 
supply chains and data-driven product design.

• 

In 2024, this generation of fast fashion is likely to face some 
challenges amid evolving standards from regulators and consumers 
alike on topics ranging from sustainability to trade practices.

71

In  2023,  fast  fashion  accelerated.  Following  in  the 
footsteps  of  e-commerce  giant  and  market  leader 
Shein,  a  cohort  of  challengers  has  upended  the 
competitive landscape by producing fashion quicker 
and  cheaper  than  before.246  The  first  generation 
of  fast-fashion  heavyweights,  like  H&M  and  Zara, 
that  introduced  the  concept  of  trendy  runway-
inspired fashion at affordable prices has before been 
challenged  by  a  second  generation  of  digital-first 
fast-fashion  players  like  Asos  and  Boohoo.  Now,  a 
third  generation  of  companies  is  making  its  mark. 
Rising players include Temu — a marketplace owned 
by  China-based  PDD  Holdings,  which  overtook 
Amazon  as  the  most-downloaded  shopping  app  in 
the US and in most of the other 16 markets in which 
it  operates  just  months  after  launching;247  Turkey-
based  Trendyol,  a  marketplace  backed  by  Chinese 
internet giant Alibaba; and Cider, a US-based retailer 
targeting Gen-Z with a third-generation fast-fashion 
business model.   

However,  this  speed  does  not  always  translate  to 
delivery  times  —  customers  often  wait  weeks  for 
parcels  to  arrive  for  the  sake  of  trendy  designs  and 
low  prices.  Customer  loyalty  is  built  on  more  than 
just price or speed  — the third generation of players is 
also transforming the customer experience through 
gamification,  micro-incentives  and  social  media 
communities.251 

Updating the Model 

Undergirding  the  third  generation  are  several 
operating model innovations: 

Agile,  scalable  manufacturer-to-consumer 
supply  chains:  Some  third-generation  companies 
have developed large networks of suppliers who often 
manufacture exclusively for them. For Shein, which 
was initially built with a first-party, owned-inventory 
model  (before  introducing  a  third-party,  cross-
category  marketplace  in  2023),  strict  performance 
management  of  suppliers  drives  reliability,  while 

Customer loyalty is built on more than solely price or speed 
— the third generation of players is transforming the customer 
experience through gamification, micro-incentives 
and social media communities.

These  companies,  with  their  ultra-low  prices 
and  rapid  turnover  of  trendy  styles,  have  captured 
the attention of consumers in western markets. Two 
companies stand out in this regard: Shein and Temu 
(which  are  the  focus  of  this  analysis).  According  to 
the BoF-McKinsey State of Fashion 2024 Consumer 
Survey,  40  percent  of  US  consumers  have  shopped 
at  Shein  or  Temu  in  the  past  12  months;  in  the  UK, 
a newer market for the retailers, that figure is at 26 
percent.  Meanwhile,  consumers  indicate  they  are 
looking  to  increase  their  spend  with  these  players: 
net  future  purchase  intent  for  Shein  and  Temu  is, 
on average, 18 percentage points higher than that of 
first-generation competitors.248

Ultra-low prices are integral to the success of the 
business  model.  Shein’s  average  SKU  price  of  $14  is 
significantly lower than H&M’s $26 and Zara’s $34.249 
Turnaround  times  from  trend  capture  to  product 
availability  are  also  condensed:  Shein  aims  for  10 
days,  under  half  the  21-day  minimum  elsewhere.250 

direct-to-consumer  delivery  from  China  enables 
rapid  scalability  with  low  inventory  risk.  Temu, 
meanwhile, operates purely as a marketplace, finding 
manufacturers with excess capacity and onboarding 
them to sell unbranded goods directly to consumers 
in  a  low-price  “B2B2C”  model.252  While  Temu’s 
prices  are  often  between  10  percent  and  40  percent 
lower than Shein’s, the retailer has faced challenges 
relating to quality control and reliability.253 254

Data-driven  product  design  and  testing: 
At  Shein,  products  are  designed  or  selected  using 
demand-driven  trend  modelling,  which  includes 
a  range  of  data  inputs  from  current  trends  to  viral 
products  to  consumer  perception.  Shein  adds 
between 2,000 and 10,000 items to its app every day 
and  produces  in  small  batches;  to  maintain  a  tight 
grip  on  inventories,  hit  rates  comparing  product 
page  visits  to  sales  are  evaluated  in  real  time.255 
Temu’s approach also evaluates hit rates to feed back 
information  to  sellers  on  trends  and  demand  levels 

72

The State of Fashion 2024Fashion System

for their products.256

Loyal  and  growing  customer  bases:  Third-
generation  retailers  have  focused  on  building  large, 
deeply  engaged,  loyal  communities.  Shein’s  multi-
layered  affiliate  marketing  influencer  programme, 
paired  with  organic  social  community  building, 
has  driven  viral  user  growth  and  low  customer 
acquisition  costs.257  Temu  is  investing  in  marketing 
in  a  bid  to  scale  rapidly,  posting  more  than  double 
the  number  of  Facebook  ads  in  the  US  than  Shein, 
and  more  than  four  times  as  many  as  Amazon.  It 
reportedly spent $14 million for two 30-second slots 
during  the  2023  Super  Bowl,  while  market  analysis 
suggests  its  quarterly  marketing  investments  are 
nearly $500 million.258 259

High  app  adoption  rates  and  engagement 
tactics:  Shein  uses  extensive  in-app  gamification, 
allowing  customers  to  earn 
loyalty  points  by 
undertaking  a  variety  of  steps,  including  setting 
up  an  account,  uploading  reviews,  watching 
livestreams and participating in outfit challenges.260 

10  percent,  compared  with  an  industry  average  of  2 
percent.  Its  retention  rates  rival  those  of  Amazon, 
Shein and Walmart.261 262 

Pushing Back

While  they  may  have  developed  loyal  customer 
bases, these third-generation fast-fashion companies 
are  also  subject  to  public  and  regulatory  scrutiny. 
Consumers  are  increasingly  aware  of  fast  fashion’s 
role  in  the  wider  industry’s  negative  impact  on  the 
environment, while policy makers in key markets — 
notably  the  US  and  EU  —  are  considering  new  laws 
to address the fast-fashion industry’s alleged role in 
a culture of overconsumption and make-take-waste. 
Against  this  backdrop,  some  of  the  core  tenets 
of  the  third-generation  fast-fashion  business  model 
are  becoming  less  attractive.  The  use  of  small-
batch,  reactive  production  has  been  positioned  by 
some players as part of a “zero-waste” sustainability 
narrative.  However,  this  type  of  production  is  also 
linked  to  rapid  trend  cycles,  which  go  hand  in  hand 
with  ultra-cheap  products  that  are  often  quickly 
discarded.263  Some  third-generation  players  have 
attempted,  not  always  successfully,  to  promote  a 
more  sustainable,  ethical  side  to  their  businesses 
through  marketing  campaigns.  Shein’s  recent 
influencer campaign to refashion the perception of its 
supply-chain ethics, in which a group of influencers 
were  invited  to  a  Shein  innovation  centre,  was  seen 
as  an  attempt  to  gloss  over  the  company’s  alleged 
association with unethical practices.264

from 

Many  trade  and  tax  bodies  are  considering  new 
standards that address the way in which some third-
generation  fast-fashion  companies  have  dealt  with 
“de minimis” trade laws in jurisdictions like the US, 
where  import  taxes  are  less  for  shipping  individual 
orders  directly 
factories 
to  customers 
abroad,  rather  than  in  bulk  —  a  common  practice 
among  third-generation  fast-fashion  players.265  US 
legislators are currently debating two bipartisan bills 
related  to  de  minimis  exceptions  and  customs  and 
border  scrutiny,  which  in  their  current  form  could 
mean  that  exporters  from  countries  such  as  China 
fast-fashion 
(including  major 
players)  would  no  longer  be  eligible  for  de  minimis 
exceptions and would instead face enhanced customs 
and border scrutiny.266

players  mature.  For  example,  while  Temu’s  large 
performance  marketing  spend  and  discounts  have 
so far helped the company to grow, it remains to be 
seen if it will be able to maintain its current strategy, 
which  requires  significant  investments  in  customer 
acquisition and razor-sharp logistics.267

The Imperative to Adapt

The  scene  has  been  set  for  further  disruption  in 
the  industry.  In  the  face  of  incoming  regulations, 
increasing  public  scrutiny  and  falling  valuations 
(Shein’s  $100  billion  2022  valuation  reportedly 
dropped  to  $66  billion  in  2023),  third-generation 
players may not be able to settle into their business 
models just yet and may need to adapt again.268 

Shein  is  attempting  to  diversify  its  strategy  in  a 
bid to maintain its leading position. The company is 
experimenting with offline retail, including pop-ups 
and shops-in-shops.269 It has formed a joint venture 
with Forever 21 to expand its US offline experience, 
and has also recently acquired the Missguided brand 
in the UK.270 271 In response to import tax restrictions, 
Shein  is  also  expanding  its  supply  chain  beyond 
its  network  of  manufacturers  in  China,  building 
warehouses in Europe, the US and Canada, as well as 
factories in Brazil.272 

As  Shein  adapts  its  model  to  face  the  new 
challenges  —

manufacturers  largely  in  China  to  new  suppliers 
elsewhere in the world, and from a direct-to-consumer

online  model  to  offline  or  omnichannel  retail  — 
what  has  been  its  competitive  edge  could  face  some 
dilution and the stickiness of its core customer base 
may be challenged. 

The  “everything  store”  marketplace  model 
might  hold  the  key  to  potential  success  for  players. 
Shein  has  piloted  the  model  in  the  US  and  Brazil 
and  has  indicated  potential  to  expand  in  2024.273 
The  retailer  is  even  beginning  to  enter  luxury 
fashion,  with  listings  from  some  luxury  brands 
posted by third-party sellers making their way onto 
its  marketplace  (although  the  authenticity  of  these 
items is, as yet, unverified).274 

doubling  down  on  marketplaces  to  expand  across 
categories,  price  points  and  consumer  segments. 
Customer  engagement  is  likely  to  remain  a  key 
differentiator,  as  third-generation  players  use  their 
strong  communities  and  gamification  tactics  to 
increase average basket size, seeking to grow profits 
and safeguard a viable business model for the future. 
The industry as a whole could feel the effects of these 
third-generation  players:  companies  might  want 
to  take  note  of  their  most  successful  strategies  to 
capture the attention of the modern consumer.

EXECUTIVE INTERVIEW

Musinsa: 
Taking the K-Fashion 
Ecosystem Global

By Janet Kersnar

Mun-il Han, has helped build 
the fast-growing South Korean 
fashion e-retailer, and has 
created what he believes is a 
differentiating business model 
that benefits up-and-coming 
brands, their Gen-Z customers 
and Musinsa itself. Now, riding 
the wave of K-culture’s surging 
global popularity, Musinsa is 
doubling down on international 
expansion. 

78

Mun-il Han,  
Chief Executive, 
Musinsa

The State of Fashion 2024Having a global presence 

and recognition would 
have been hard to 

imagine only just a few years 
ago for Korea’s fashion industry, 
which is increasingly on global 
brands’ radars thanks in large 
part to fashion’s ability to 
benefit from the recent surge in 
popularity of K-films and series, 
according to Mun-il Han, who 
became CEO of the Seoul-based 
fashion marketplace in 2022 at 
the age of 33. “When I look back 
[in 2018 when I joined] fashion 
marketplace Musinsa, it usually 
was quite rare that a CEO or a top 
executive of a global brand would 
actually come to Seoul, and even 
if they did, they wouldn’t stay very 
long,” he recalled. “That has very 
much changed.”

But Musinsa wasn’t going to 
wait around for global recognition 
to make its own mark on Korea’s 
fashion industry. Starting out in 
e-commerce’s early days in 2001 
as an online platform for sneaker-
loving high school kids to share 
street fashion photos, Musinsa has 
grown into a fashion marketplace 
that it says comprises a community 
of 13 million, largely Gen-Z fans, 
with a 2023 funding round that 
reportedly valued the company at 
approximately $2.76 billion.

According to Han, Musinsa 
has taken a different approach 
than other fashion e-tailers by 
focusing on the sellers — that is, 
the 8,000 local and global brands 
selling their apparel and footwear 
on its Korean platform or via its 
app, including independent brands 
it helps fund and support by, for 
example, providing marketing and 
innovative initiatives to connect 
them directly with customers. One 
such initiative was its first-ever 

Fashion System

“Musinsa Season Preview” event, 
where customers could visit four 
offline venues in Seoul to share 
their thoughts alongside those of 
a panel of industry experts on the 
Spring/Summer 2024 collections 
from 30 local brands, which could 
then adjust pricing and inventory 
based on the feedback. 

Beyond Korea, Musinsa is now 

present in 13 countries, selling 
around 800 Korean brands. 
Han said one of the markets 
where K-fashion is in increasing 
demand is Japan, where it set up a 
subsidiary in 2021 and has become 
the company’s largest global 
market. 

With bands like BTS, Blackpink 
and most recently New Jeans 
(the latter a Musinsa brand 
ambassador), K-pop’s star just 
seems to keep rising higher. 
Analysts at Bernstein recently 
said the K-pop industry could 
generate annual revenue of 
approximately $10 billion by 
2030, or roughly double 2023’s 
level. How is K-fashion riding 
that wave?

I don’t think the global impact of 
K-pop is fully hitting home to us 
in Korea. It’s not just K-pop stars 
but also K-celebrities who are 
really gaining global exposure with 
the popularity of K-content or for 
movies and dramas. Especially 
fashion and luxury brands, they 
are leveraging K-pop stars and 
signing them on as their brand 
ambassadors. We can indirectly 
feel the extent to which these pop 
stars now have so much influence 
and power.

We’re still in the incipient 
stages, but I think when these 
artists or musicians share their 
daily lives on social media, that’s 

79

when fans really take interest. 
Then also when people watch 
K-content like movies and dramas 
and they see how Korean people 
or celebrities dress or what their 
lifestyle is like, people gradually 
start to become familiar with their 
lifestyle and their dress. 

It’s a bit like what happened 
with hip-hop. People who were 
doing hip-hop in Korea wanted 
to emulate that way of life and 
consume the brands that were part 
of that. We feel that K-content is 
now at a similar juncture, where 
it’s being exported abroad. It’s 
taken a while for fashion to have a 
distinct connection with K-culture 
but it’s starting to happen. At 
Musinsa, we want to leverage 
that opportunity to really expand 
our global footprint, after having 
grown very rapidly by mainly 
focusing on the online fashion 
market in Korea.

Ever since Musinsa became 
a fully fledged fashion 
retail platform in the 2010s, 
fashion retail generally has 
been undergoing disruption 
and change. What has been 
Musinsa’s role in this? Does 
Musinsa consider itself one of 
the disruptors?

We definitely see ourselves as a 
disruptor. Korea’s fashion market  
in the past was very much led 
by the department stores — you 
only had a handful of brands that 
were able to launch in department 
stores and that were recognised 
as bonified brands. Whereas with 
the emergence of a platform such 
as ours, we see many new brands 
emerging to create a fashion 
ecosystem.

Back in 2001, we started as 
an online community. It was a 

A Musinsa Standard store in Hongdae, Seoul, South Korea. Musinsa (above).

community where young people 
were able to freely exchange 
information and narratives about 
fashion and lifestyle that they 
were interested in. This was a very 
active community, a community 
where we were also able to 
introduce overseas street fashion 
brands that Koreans may not have 
been familiar with and introduce 
some local brands that were up 
and coming. 

Right from the beginning, we 
had a very strong understanding of  
what young people wanted, what 
their needs were. At the same time, 
brands were looking for channels 
to sell their products and large 

companies also wanted to do 
business online but weren’t really 
aware of what young people like 
and need. 

In terms of that ecosystem, 
how does it enable Musinsa 
to differentiate itself in 
an increasingly crowded 
e-retailing market?

If we look at this from a platform 
perspective, the China-based 
platforms are really doing well in 
terms of gamification. But in Korea, 
I don’t think we see any notable 
results with gamification. Rather 
than that, I think the biggest 
differentiator of our company 

compared to other e-commerce 
platforms is that we really zero in 
on managing the sellers.

Also, we focus more on what 
I would call the “essence” rather 
than things like gamification. What 
I mean by that is, people who are 
interested in fashion or lifestyle 
through our community are able to 
ask questions about fashion. They 
are able to get recommendations 
from other people within the 
community. We don’t think that 
algorithms alone provide the best 
recommendations, so we try to mix 
our curation with the data to come 
up with the best recommendation 
for our customers.

80

The State of Fashion 2024We’ve always had the 

philosophy that we focus on the 
seller. Because of the success of 
Amazon, most of the e-commerce 
players at that time were more 
focused on the buyer side. What 
we had in mind was something 
more like a content business, like 
Netflix and Spotify, while also 
focusing more on the needs of the 
seller, the fashion brands on our 
platform, the small independent 
brands who have a little bit more 
of a personality or individuality. 

What does partnering with 
up-and-coming designers 
entail? Why do you want to 
work with these designers?

The key for our business is to 
be able to secure good, talented 
new brands, and even enter 
agreements in which they sell 
with us exclusively. … We feel the 
right formula is to really study 
what their needs are as they are 
rising, support them to address 
those needs, and build a good 
relationship and thereby build a 
fashion ecosystem. 

Just like Netflix invests in 
production companies, or like 
YouTube secures a lot of great 
creators on its platform by 
providing them with various 
tools, Musinsa partners with and 
invests in brands, that investment 
can provide everything from 
marketing content to interest-free 
loans to help fund their production 
plans or tools on our platform like 
how-to videos. 

After a brand joins us, we’re 
able to see very quickly the type of 
reception it is getting, how much 
feedback there is [from customers 
on the platform], along with sales 
figures. So, we’re able to quickly 
identify if a brand is really growing 

Fashion System

so that’s why we’re expanding our 
offline presence. We opened our 
offline flagship stores in Daegu 
and Seoul in late 2023. As for our 
private brand, Musinsa Standard, 
we have a store in Busan scheduled 
to open at the end of 2023.

Our global expansion strategy 

involves a gradual introduction 
of westernised global brands and 
will evolve with emerging brands 
too. It’s been about a year since we 
launched our app test cases to run 
alongside the platform [for non-
Korean markets]. Currently it’s in 
phase one and we have about 800 
Korean brands on that app. Phase 
two should happen around the end 
of [2024] when we believe we will 
be able to carry foreign brands too. 
These would be very westernised 
types of brands and that would 
help enhance the visibility of the 
Korean brands as well. Then in 
phase three we’re thinking it could 
be in Tokyo, Bangkok or Singapore 
or anywhere else, but to really 
grow the platform to incubate 
these other new brands.

This interview has been edited and condensed.

or if there are any issues that need 
to be addressed. That’s not to say 
that we provide equal amounts of 
support to all our brands. We try 
to sow as many seeds as possible 
and then when we see there is 
explosive growth of a certain high-
potential brand, we really try to 
support them so that we can grow 
together. 

In 2023, Musinsa secured $190 
million of series C funding, led 
by investment company KKR. 
Given that you’ve long focused 
on 20-somethings in Korea, 
what are your plans for taking 
Musinsa’s ‘K-ecosystem’ to 
different demographics and 
other markets?

First, we are broadening our 
customer base to include 
individuals in their late 20s and 
30s, due to focus on offering an 
extended range such as high-end 
brands.

Offline and online are both 

important but basically 99.9 
percent of our sales occur online, 
so we have to continue to motivate 
our consumers to come online to 
shop. But people do want to try on 
the clothes before they buy, and

All Eyes
On Brand

Brand marketing will likely be back in the limelight 
in the year ahead as the fashion industry confronts 
a shifting landscape in which performance 
marketing no longer reigns. Consumers’ emotional 
connections to brands will likely be critical as 
fashion marketers reorientate their playbooks to 
emphasise long-term brand-building strategies.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  Fashion marketers need to find new ways to engage shoppers 

given the increasingly onerous costs of performance marketing 
and the introduction of data privacy regulations restricting 
customer targeting.

•  71 percent of fashion executives plan to spend more on brand 

marketing in 2024 than previously, while 46 percent intend to do 
so for performance marketing, according to the BoF-McKinsey 
State of Fashion 2024 Executive Survey.

•  Brands may lean into marketing to refine how they establish 

emotional connections with consumers and will likely collaborate 
across the fashion industry and adjacent sectors in a bid to build 
compelling brand stories.

Brand-building isn’t what it used to be. After years of 
leaning  heavily  on  instantly  trackable  performance 
marketing,  the  fashion  marketing  landscape  is 
shifting. A convergence of factors, including pressures 
on  discretionary  spend,  is  sharpening  consumer 
appetite  for  entertaining  brand  storytelling  that 
captures their aspirations and interests, well beyond 
the products on offer.275 Spurring this change are the 
increasing costs of performance marketing alongside 
new  data  privacy  regulations  restricting  customer 
targeting, forcing marketers to find different ways to 
engage with shoppers. 

Many  fashion  leaders  now  plan  to  reprioritise 
marketing  spend.  According  to  the  BoF-McKinsey 
State  of  Fashion  2024  Executive  Survey,  71  percent 
of executives plan to increase brand marketing spend 
in 2024, while 46 percent intend to do the same for 
performance marketing.276 This marks a fundamental 
shift  for  many  fashion  companies,  including  direct-
to-consumer labels that have built their brands using 
the 
targeted  performance-marketing 
playbook.277

trackable, 

While brand marketing by its very nature doesn’t 
enable  the  same  depth  of  trackable  insights  as 
performance  marketing,  it  does  offer  other  benefits 
—  notably,  done  effectively,  it  can  help  brands  to 
stand out in an increasingly saturated media world. 

Brand  marketing  is  also  proving  to  be  pivotal  in 
transforming  a  label’s  market  position,  while  often 
helping it capture entirely new customer bases.

Identity Revamp

Effective brand marketing needs to employ a multi-
pronged  strategy  over  time,  rather  than  one-off 
moments.  Sustained,  holistic  brand  marketing  
can  transform  brand  images,  as  several  recent 
examples show.

Germany-based  Hugo  Boss  launched  an  image 
reboot  with  heavy  investment  in  brand  marketing 
that aimed to attract young consumers. With newly 
differentiated branding for “Hugo,” aimed at Gen-Z, 
and “Boss,” aimed at Millennials, it updated its logo 
and  other  visual  cues  and  enlisted  ambassadors 
like  Hailey  Bieber,  rolling  out  a  star-studded  web 
and  out-of-home  campaign  and  hosting  events 
including  see-now-buy-now 
fashion  shows  and 
sponsoring  sporting  events  to  feature  its  new 
streetwear-influenced  looks.  In  March  2023,  the 
company announced the first full-year results since 
the rebrand, attributing record sales of €3.65 billion 
($3.85  billion)  in  large  part  to  the  “momentum” 
throughout  2022  it  gained  from  the  new-look  Boss 
and Hugo brands.278

began a refresh of its Zegna menswear brand in the 
run-up to its initial public offering in 2021. The brand 
streamlined  and  modernised  its  image,  dropping 
“Ermenegildo” from its name and condensing three 
sub-brands  into  one  modern,  slick  Zegna-branded 
umbrella. The company also collaborated with luxury 
streetwear  label  Fear  of  God  to  tap  into  a  broader, 
younger  audience  as  part  of  a  wider  casualisation 
campaign, which expanded Zegna’s brand authority 
from  tailored  suits  to  luxury  leisurewear  for  the 
modern  quiet  luxury  consumer.279  280  281  Zegna’s 
full-year  2022  sales  rose  16  percent  year  on  year  to 
€1.5 billion ($1.6 billion).

Meanwhile, New Balance has used collaborations 
as  a  part  of  its  broader  strategy  to  elevate  the 
brand  and  drive  demand.  In  addition  to  targeted 
inventory allocation across channels, product drops 
and  marketing  investments,  the  sneaker  brand 
leveraged tie-ups with image-driving partners, such 
as  JJJJound,  Miu  Miu,  Joe  Freshgoods  and  Aimé 
Leon  Dore,  while  tapping  ALD’s  Teddy  Santis  to  be 
creative  director  of  New  Balance  Made  in  USA.282 
These  actions  have  reinforced  New  Balance’s  brand 
positioning, with it ranking as one of the best-selling 
brands on sneaker resale platforms Goat, StockX and 
Flight Club.283 284 285

The Brand Marketing Toolkit

As  consumers  crave  greater  connection  and 
authenticity  from  brands,  marketing  efforts  will 
home in on brand storytelling and emotional affinity 
through multiple avenues. 

One  way  this  can  be  done  is  by  leveraging  the 
personalities behind a brand, such as the founder or 
creative  director.  Think  Miu  Miu  (Miuccia  Prada) 
or  Loewe  and  JW  Anderson  (Jonathan  Anderson) 
or  Jacquemus  (Simon  Porte  Jacquemus)  —  labels 
that  featured  in  the  recent  quarterly  Lyst  index  of 
fashion’s  most  prominent  brands.286  Underscoring 
how  many  consumers  gravitate  towards  the  people 
who personify and drive a brand,287 organic content 
can  be  created  around  these  personalities 
in 
authentic, personable ways.

However, 

there  are  other  ways 

to  build 
communities  that  don’t  rely  on  a  brand’s  stand-out 
personality.  In  the  case  of  Nike,  bold  ad  campaigns 
featuring  high-profile  athletes  have  over  the  years 
created  a  perception  around  the  brand  for  focusing 
on  social  causes.288  Meanwhile,  as  heritage  luxury 
brands  have  shown,  there’s  plenty  of  scope  for 
storytelling  that  pivots  around  other  aspects  of 
their brands’ unique qualities. Hermès, for example, 
has  long  employed  deep  brand  stories  that  evoke

and  brand  specialists  as  well  as  data,  finance  and 
strategy leaders to form a cohesive brand story. After 
years of focusing on performance marketing, CMOs 
must  now  invest  in  hiring  and  training  teams  to 
bolster  brand  marketing  capabilities,  ensuring  that 
the marketing department contains both brand and 
performance  marketing  specialists  that  can  work 
closely  together.  Indeed,  more  companies  may  hire 
chief  brand  officers  as  brands  take  a  more  holistic 
view of their storytelling and marketing efforts. 

Undergirding  this  is  a  focus  on  the  long-term 
story. This will require a mentality shift, with impact 
measurement  focused  on  longer-term,  strategic 
horizons, rather than instant return on investment — 
while blockbuster marketing campaigns can generate 
immediate  buzz,  maintaining  consumer  attention 
thereafter  is  a  challenge.  Consumers  expect  to  see 
brand  stories  that  are  consistent  and  authentic;  the 
success  of  purpose-led  brands  such  as  Patagonia 
are  proof  points.  Brand  marketing  may  need  to  be 
maintained with consistent storytelling throughout 
consumers’ day-to-day lives, from large-scale events 
to  touchpoints  on  social  media.  However,  2024 
won’t  be  about  generating  more  and  more  content, 
or perpetually refreshing brand identities. Now, the 
focus  needs  to  be  on  “less  is  more,”  with  carefully 
crafted  storytelling  that  amplifies  a  brand’s  clear, 
coherent personality.

a  history  of  craftmanship.  At  Tiffany  &  Company, 
the  brand  was  revitalised  after  its  acquisition  by 
LVMH,  balancing  established  brand  stories  and 
new  campaigns  with  stars  like  musicians  Jay-Z  and 
Beyoncé to access a new generation of consumers.289 
There’s  also  a  brand  marketing  opportunity  by 
creating memorable shopping moments. Connecting 
emotionally with consumers has become increasingly 
difficult  in  a  world  of  ever-shortening  attention 
spans.  However,  by  meeting  consumers  in  the  real 
world  with  activations  that  span  channels,  brands 
can  capture  attention  and  build  a  more  pervasive 
presence  in  customers’  lives.  Immersive  stores, 
featuring  visually  striking  spaces  and  interactive, 
multisensory  experiences,  can  be  employed  here.290 
291 A range of brands have already been experimenting 
with  boldly  designed  pop-ups  which  often  have  the 
additional  benefit  of  serving  as  ideal  backdrops  for 
shoppers’  social  media  posts.  Examples  include 
Jacquemus’s  handbag  vending  machines,  Chanel’s 
perfume-themed diner, H&M’s immersive collection 
launches and Pretty Little Thing’s themed influencer 
showroom.292 293 294 295

Melding  marketing  strategies  with  adjacent 
industries  such  as  music,  film  and  sports,  is  also 
helping 
fashion  brands  remain  relevant  with 
customers.  In  2024,  brands  may  consider  investing 
further 
joint 
ventures and sponsorships.296 LVMH announced its 
“premium”  sponsorship  deal  of  the  2024  summer 
Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris, with plans 
for individual brands to make standout contributions 
in  the  run-up  to  the  games.297  298  Following  on  the 
heels  of  LVMH’s  news,  Kering-owner  François-
Henri  Pinault  announced  that  his  family’s  holding 
company  Artémis  had  closed  a  multi-billion-dollar 
deal to acquire a majority stake in Hollywood talent 
giant Creative Artists Agency, perhaps a precursor to 
fashion players inking more cross-cultural deals.299

Creating Long-Lasting Affinity

Succeeding as a brand in 2024 may require a shift in 
priorities  —  selectively  using  brand-building  tools 
to  develop  compelling  brand  stories,  supported  by 
a  long-term  strategy  and  underpinned  by  the  right 
talent and channel investments.

Fashion System

Dior: 
Balancing Tradition, 
Innovation and Scale

By Robert Williams

Having piloted Dior’s image 
through the tenures of a 
succession of designers and 
three CEOs, Olivier Bialobos is 
now working to drive the luxury 
brand’s growth and desirability  
at unprecedented scale.

During 18 years at Christian 

Dior, Olivier Bialobos has 
established himself as the 
French couture house’s 360-degree 
communications maven amid an 
ever-widening scope of projects 
to craft a varied, yet consistent 
message and glorify the Dior name. 
Bialobos joined the company 

C-suite executive since Parfums 
Christian Dior and Christian Dior 
Couture in the 1960s. Then under 
new CEO Delphine Arnault in 
2023, Bialobos was elevated to the 
role of deputy managing director 
in a consecration of his long-term 
contribution to and vision for the 
French house.  

in 2006 during the heyday of 
former womenswear creative 
director John Galliano — then 
was charged with building a stable 
platform amid frequent creative 
turnover under Raf Simons and 
a studio-designed interregnum 
before the blockbuster tenure 
of Maria Grazia Chiuri since 
2016. On the menswear side, his 
work intersected with creative 
director Kris Van Assche, and then 
Kim Jones, as well as Victoire 
and Cordelia de Castellane to 
design jewellery and homeware, 
respectively.   

Still, Dior’s message of dreamy 

glamour and couture excellence 
came across more strongly than 
ever as owner LVMH continued 
to invest heavily in celebrating 
the prized asset, the first brand in 
chairman Bernard Arnault’s luxury 
empire. 

In addition to multi-million-

dollar runway spectacles 
throughout the year — from 
Paris Couture Week to far-flung 
travel shows to weekend-long 
experiences for high jewellery 
collectors — the brand has invested 
in establishing itself as a cultural 
institution through museum 
exhibitions as well as countless 
artist collaborations and celebrity 
partnerships. 

In 2021, Bialobos’ remit 
expanded to include oversight 
of Dior’s beauty division, the 
first time the units have shared a 

Dior revenue has been growing 
in recent years, and Citi 
estimates that it will rise to 
€10.2 billion ($11.4 billion) in 
2024 from €8.7 billion ($9.3 
billion) in 2022. How does this 
change the job of marketing a 
luxury brand? 

It isn’t the scale that makes the 
job different so much as the 
period we’re living in. There’s so 
many communications tools that 
have appeared and you need to 
always be adapting to. Twenty 
years ago, there was no Instagram, 
no TikTok, not to mention all 
the more specific platforms in 
countries like China and Japan. 
Now we’re also seeing new 
opportunities related to TV thanks 
to streaming platforms like Netflix, 
Apple TV. 

All of this means that, 

compared to the past, we have to 
produce much more content. Not 
so long ago, you were doing one ad 
campaign, maybe a little film every 
season. Marketing the fashion side 
was essentially just pictures. And 
we didn’t have so many collections 
to promote either. 

When operating across so 
many channels, what steps can 
marketers and communicators 
take to avoid saturating 
the market, to avoid being 
overexposed? Can couture 
brands adopt the performance-

88

driven approaches that are 
increasingly popular, or would 
that be antithetical to the idea 
of luxury? 

Desirability — not just visibility 
— has to be the target. That’s 
always been part of Dior from the 
beginning. There’s no recipe, but it 
all has to do with values somehow. 
Mr Dior had a vision with strong 
values: creativity, exceptional 
savoir-faire, inventiveness, 
audacity. Don’t forget that this 
was just after the [Second World 
War]. Those values remain very 
important to us today; then we 
could also add sustainability. 
Performance marketing 
is about playing the game, it’s 
normal. But while you have to 
work on your current clients and 
make them dream, you also have to 
work on your potential clients, and 
make them dream. You promote 
the product properly and strongly, 
but then you also create emotions. 

‘Designer of Dreams’ [Dior’s 
retrospective museum exhibit 
that has been shown at the 
Musée des Arts Decoratifs 
(in Paris, Victoria & Albert 
in London and Long Museum 
in Shanghai] seems to mainly 
address the latter priority, 
which a lot of people would just 
call ‘brand marketing,’ although 
on quite a large scale. You also 
recently opened Dior’s own 
fashion museum — La Galerie 
Dior in Paris, the world’s largest 
museum devoted to a single 
designer. What is the strategy 
behind those museum projects?

We wanted ‘Designer of Dreams’ 
to be a mix of our heritage and also 
Dior today, presented in a modern 
way. It’s been a huge success — 

The State of Fashion 2024normally the MAD gets 400,000 
visitors per year, during ‘Designer 
of Dreams’ it had 800,000 people 
in six months.

What’s very important is to 
make people dream, and with this 
show some people who don’t care 
about fashion, they escape and 
dream for hours. It’s about when 
you get out of the Galerie Dior or 
the V&A with stars in your eyes — 
and now Dior means something 
to you. 

What’s also great is we have a 
huge range of products, starting 
with a fragrance or even a lipstick, 
up to an haute couture dress. So, if 
you love Dior you can buy into the 
brand at every level.  

You’ve been responsible for the 
‘One Dior’ image since 2021 
— meaning you oversee image 
and communications for Dior’s 
cosmetics now too. What were 
the most important steps you’ve 
taken towards unifying the Dior 
message across fashion and 
beauty? 

You need a common thread — a 
fil rouge we would say in French 
— between fashion and beauty. 
That’s very interesting and 
pretty challenging because it’s 
two different timetables: You 
don’t often create a lipstick or a 
fragrance in less than two years, 
while we can create a [fashion] 
collection in four months.

But both can focus on the icons 
and the codes, to become one voice 
— which is stronger and louder. 
We’re unifying the messages  
and the energy.  

More and more of Dior’s 
perfume ads have been re-shot 
with clothes, reflecting the 
current designers’ aesthetic 

Fashion System

on the couture side, or they’ve 
started to feature the updated 
logo and typefaces from 2017 
more prominently. 

It’s not just the clothes, now. 
One of Maria Grazia Chiuri’s 
favourite photographers, Brigitte 
[Niedermair], recently shot the 
J’Adore campaign. We are using 
more and more of the same visual 
language overall. 

There are also some of the 
same ambassadors across beauty 
and fashion, like Jisoo [from South 
Korean band Blackpink].  

Dior has navigated the 
transitions from John Galliano 
to Raf Simons to Maria Grazia 
Chiuri. What did you learn 
from managing that creative 
turnover? 

I was very fortunate to work with 
all those incredible designers, 
who each had a vision; each had 
a different way of working or of 
finding inspiration. John was 
taking research trips, making 
these research books that were 
sort of like his version of a mood 
board, then spending hours in 
these very closed-door fittings 
with just his immediate deputies. 
Raf was more focused on art and 
artists. With Maria Grazia, it’s 
more open, it’s about visiting 
ateliers, reading tonnes of books, 
trying to have a conversation — 
with artisans, with people. She 
isn’t trying to put the light on 
herself. 

Ultimately our designers 
are constantly reinterpreting or 
sublimating our codes because it’s 
about storytelling, and creating 
dreams. All the designers are 
immersing themselves in the 
archives.

89

How can the codes and values of a 
brand like Dior change over time?

For the codes, Dior has long been 
associated with its flagship bar 
jacket or cannage stitching. But 
other motifs can become codes 
over time, like how Maria Grazia 
revived the Toile de Jouy and made 
it a stamp of the brand.

In terms of values, the notion 
of femininity has evolved over the 
years and under every designer. 
Maria Grazia brought something 
about not just femininity but 
feminism that was really a very 
strong statement.  

She was convinced it was the 
right thing and she had a vision. 
She didn’t want to fight — there’s 
something negative about that — 
but rather she wanted to promote 
something.

In 2017, she’s been very 
criticised in fashion because of a 
T-shirt [reading “We Should All Be 
Feminists”]. Today I receive calls 
from museums all over the world 
to have this outfit. 

Are there any other lessons 
you’d like to share about 
marketing a luxury brand?  

Mr Dior used to say, ‘Tradition 
needs to be disrupted so that 
it always remains modern and 
desirable.’ That’s a quote I use 
almost every day.

Sustainability 
Rules

The era of the fashion industry self-regulating 
sustainability is drawing to a close around the 
world. Across jurisdictions, new rules could have a 
widespread impact on both consumers and fashion 
players. Brands and manufacturers need to revamp 
business models to align with the changes ahead.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  As many as 16 pieces of legislation relating to fashion and textiles 
were under discussion in late 2023 in the EU alone, with the first 
coming into force in 2024.

•  The regulations span the entire fashion value chain, from product 
design to marketing, and will impact consumers and companies 
globally. 

•  Regulatory competence cannot be limited to a brand’s 

sustainability team, but rather should be embraced throughout the 
C-suite and integrated across functions.

90

The State of Fashion 2024Fashion System

The fashion industry is heading for a reality check. By 
the end of 2024, self-regulation of sustainability may 
no longer be an option.300 Many new rules around the 
world are set to mandate action on everything from 
textiles  production  and  chemicals  use  to  recycling 
and waste. 

While  some  industry  progress  is  evident,  the 
pace of transformation falls short of what is needed 
to  prepare  for  impending  regulations.  Across  the 
industry, the polluting use of fossil fuels continues to 
dominate production while circular business models 
are still in their infancy. If progress continues at the 
current  pace,  clothing  and  footwear  consumption 
is  expected  to  increase  by  over  60  percent,  from 
62  million  tonnes  in  2019  to  102  million  tonnes  in 
2030.301

With  the  industry  struggling  to  move  forward, 
regulators  are  stepping  in.  Leading  the  charge  is 
the  EU  as  it  pursues  a  vision  for  a  climate-neutral, 
circular  economy,  with  growth  decoupled  from 
the  consumption  of  finite  resources.302  303  The 
EU’s  textiles  vision  is  encapsulated  in  its  Strategy 
for  Sustainable  and  Circular  Textiles,  passed  in 
June  2023,  which  envisages  an  industry  defined  by 
products made with respect for the environment and 
social rights. As many as 16 pieces of legislation are 
currently under discussion, with the first coming to 
force in 2024. The window for brands to  prepare to 
comply is narrowing quickly.304

The Heat is On

With  fashion  responsible  for  significant  emissions, 
pollution  and  waste,  regulators  are  set  to  require 
companies  to  both  fix  their  own  operations  and 
force  higher  standards  in  their  supply  chains. 
The  regulations  apply  across  key  areas  of  activity, 
impacting  consumers  and  companies  within  and 
outside the EU.

Product design: Up to 80 percent of a product’s 
environmental  impact  is  determined  in  the  design 
phase  and  is  baked  into  materials  and  dyes.305  The 
EU’s  flagship  Ecodesign  for  Sustainable  Products 
Regulation  (ESPR),  set  to  come  into  full  effect 
by  2025,  sets  minimum  design  standards  for  all 
individual products sold within the EU. This includes 
requirements 
recyclability,  durability, 
reusability,  repairability  and  use  of  hazardous 
substances.  Digital  product  passports  that  collect 
and  share  this  information  with  consumers  are 

around 

expected to become required by law.306

Marketing:  Greenwashing  is  high  on  consumer 
and  regulatory  agendas,  with  the  claims  of  many 
companies  seen  as  vague  or  misleading.  The  new 
EU  Green  Claims  Directive  curbs  greenwashing  by 
requiring  sustainability-related  declarations  and 
statements to be specific, backed by evidence, verified 
by independent bodies and communicated clearly.307 
France  has  already  taken  the  first  step,  requiring 
large companies to put carbon labels on all clothing 
sold in the country.

Waste  management:  Less  than  1  percent  of 
fashion  textiles  are  recycled308  and  a  truckload  of 
products are sent to landfill or incinerated somewhere 
in the world every second.309 310 An amendment to the 
Waste  Framework  Directive  is  calling  for  Extended 
Producer  Responsibility,  which  already  exists  in 
France,  and  which  requires  companies  to  finance 
the collection, sorting and recycling of textile waste. 
Fees are expected to vary based on production output 
and  pollution  levels  caused,  a  principle  known  as 
“eco-modulation.” All EU countries will be required 
to  launch  textile  collection  programmes  by  2025  
and  the  destruction  of  unsold  goods  is  expected  
to be banned.311

Reporting:  Despite  huge  volumes  of  corporate 
environment, social and governance (ESG) disclosure, 
companies  still  struggle  to  secure  sufficient  data 
and  performance  metrics  or  define  economic 
activities that can be considered sustainable. A lack 
of  comparability  across  brands  inhibits  effective 
decision  making  among  investors  and  consumers.  
The  upcoming  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting 
Directive  (CSRD)  requires  companies  to  report 
on  ESG  activities  via  a  standardised  framework. 
the  Corporate  Sustainability  Due 
Meanwhile, 
Diligence  Directive  mandates  environmental  and 
human  rights  diligence  and  action  plans  across  the 
value chain.312

Notably,  the  requirement 

for  standardised, 
comprehensive  public  disclosures  has  become  a 
lightning rod of debate in the fashion industry, with 
some executives concerned about the amount of data 
and  analysis  required.  At  a  recent  conference,  the 
head  of  sustainability  at  Puma  said  that  the  brand 
had  been  publishing  reports  for  20  years  but  was 
“nowhere  near  being  able to fulfil the requirements 
of CSRD.”313 314

to  extend  beyond  the  region’s  borders,  especially 
into  Asia,  where  70  percent  of  the  EU’s  textiles 
are  manufactured.321  In  addition,  lawmakers  in 
other  regions  are  progressing  their  own  initiatives. 
In  the  US,  the  New  York  Fashion  Sustainability 
and  Social  Accountability  Act  plans  to  hold  major 
brands  accountable  for  ESG  impacts  and  supply-
chain  traceability.322  In  the  UK,  the  Green  Claims 
Code  aims  to  stem  greenwashing,  while  China  has 
committed to peaking carbon emissions before 2030 
and become carbon neutral by 2060.323 

As  the  regulatory  landscape  evolves,  the  year 

93

ahead presents an opportunity for fashion executives 
to revamp their business models. But this will likely 
require  a  holistic  approach  rather  than  targeting 
select parts of the value chain:
Traceability:  Achieving 

supply-chain 
visibility  across  all  tiers  of  manufacturing  will  be  a 
critical enabler for regulatory compliance. However, 
many  brands  currently  have  limited  visibility  over 
their  suppliers  at  best,  and  therefore  lack  reliable 
and standardised data to make meaningful progress. 
Advances  in  blockchain  and  other  technologies 
transparent  and  efficient 
may  enable  more 

full 

monitoring.  Adidas,  for  example,  has  achieved 
material  traceability  at  scale  by  using  TrusTrace’s 
digital  traceability  platform,  which  is  also  used  
by  companies  including  Renfro  Brands  and  Brooks 
Running.315

Sourcing and production: As upstream supply-
chain  activities  account  for  the  majority  of  carbon 
emissions in apparel, there may be a sharper focus on 
decarbonising  material  and  garment  production.316 
In  the  production  process,  main  decarbonisation 
levers include energy efficiency and energy transition 
initiatives.  As  brands  shift  to  more  sustainable 
materials,  they  may  look  for  new  suppliers  or 
join  strategic  alliances.  Kering,  for  example,  has 
established supplier-focused sourcing standards and 
created the Material Innovation Lab dedicated to the 
sourcing of sustainable materials and fabrics,317 while 
Hermès has partnered with start-up MycoWorks’ to 
secure access to its engineered mycelium.318 

Design:  New  requirements  for  circularity  are 

with  global  brands  like  H&M,  Inditex  and  Levi’s, 
Renewcell  plans  in  2024  to  reach  full  capacity  of 
120,000  tonnes,  or  the  equivalent  to  600  million 
T-shirts.319  Fully  embedding  these  new  materials 
into  supply  chains  remains  a  challenge,  however  — 
Renewcell recently cited slower-than-expected sales 
of its cellulosic pulp to fibre producers.320 

A Greener Horizon

While  regulations  are  being  finalised,  brands  need 
to  capitalise  on  this  grace  period  to  get  ahead. 
Regulatory  competence  is  a  critical  muscle  brands 
need  to  build  and  is  one  that  few  have  today.  And 
given the fundamental challenge regulation poses to 
some segments, such as fast fashion, procrastination 
is ill-advised.

Brands  should  consider  establishing  a  squad 
of  regulatory  experts.  This  squad  can  review  the 
laws  relevant  to  the  business,  conduct  materiality 
assessments  and  advise  on  implications  for  the

knowledge across respective departments.

expected to shake up the design process. For example, 
a focus on longevity and durability may demand fresh 
attention  to  details  such  as  stitching  and  seams. 
Equally,  materials  that  cannot  be  separated  in 
recycling may need to be avoided, meaning designers 
may  need  to  think  more  creatively  about  design 
choices.  Design  libraries  may  increasingly  support 
material  selection,  while  3D  sampling  may  reduce 
use of resources. Packaging design is also impacted, 
with  new  rules  emerging  around  composition  of 
labels and tags and elimination of single-use plastics. 
End-of-life  waste:  To  minimise  production 
and  waste,  new  business  models  are  coming  to 
the  fore.  Resale  continues  to  grow  through  brand 
partnerships  with  secondhand  marketplaces,  such 
as  The  RealReal  or  Vestiaire  Collective.  In-house 
programmes  offering  resale,  rental  and  repair  are 
gaining traction as well. There is also an opportunity 
to accelerate closed-loop recycling. Stockholm-based

organisation. However, regulation ultimately cannot 
be outsourced to a single team. All C-suite executives 
need  to  build  knowledge,  align  strategies  within 
the  regulatory  programme,  identify  capabilities 
and  tools  required  for  change,  and  disseminate 
knowledge across respective departments. 

Additionally,  brands  should  consider  viewing 
regulation  as  an  opportunity  rather  than  a  threat. 
For example, regulation may spur demand for certain 
materials, creating supply and peaking demand. This 
could be transformed into a competitive advantage by 
strategically  gaining  access  to  innovative  materials 
in short supply.

Finally,  industry  associations  and  trade  groups, 
such as the Council of Fashion Designers of America 
or the European Fashion Alliance, have a major role 
to  play  in  shaping  policy.  Corporate  leaders  should 
consider  engaging  with  such  groups,  contributing 
to  discussions  and  galvanising  stakeholders  to 
co-create effective regulation between policy makers 
and the industry.

overproduction and overconsumption 
that underpins the industry’s 
environmental impact.325

It’s an issue signatories to the 
UN Fashion Charter, who include 
many of the world’s biggest brands, 
have pledged to tackle. But it 
also strikes at the heart of one of 
fashion’s biggest sustainability 
hurdles: businesses geared towards 
driving more consumption will 
always be part of the problem. 
Increasingly, regulators are 
looking to tackle the challenge 
from various angles, looking at 
ways to make brands responsible 
for textile waste and incentivise 
designing for long life and 
circularity. But the role marketing 
plays has been overlooked, said 
Rachel Arthur, a sustainability 
strategist and sustainable fashion 
advocacy lead at UNEP.

That needs to change, but that 
doesn’t mean the end of fashion, it 
just means a new focus, she said.

Rachel, you spearheaded the 
playbook project. Why did you feel 
like this was the thing to focus on? 

This started on the UNEP side with 
a piece of work that was looking at 
the role of communication to help 
drive change and inspire action 
within the industry. 

Typically, a piece of work like 
that would lead to a consumer-facing 
campaign on the need for greater 
sustainability within the fashion sector 
[or] more sustainable consumption. 
Actually, the outcome from strategy 
was that while that kind of work 
was possible and viable and could 
be considered necessary, there 
seemed to be a much more powerful 
lever to consider, not just looking at 
what consumers could do, but why 
consumers were consuming in the 
way that they were.

That comes down to primarily 

the brands and then the media, 
and the ecosystem that surrounds 
them. The industry is so good 
at creating desire. But we’re 
making people fall in love with 
something that isn’t serving us 
on a planetary basis. The primary 
message put forward is based 
on a linear economic model and 
on messages fundamentally of 
overconsumption. 

These job functions need 
to be part of this conversation. 
Communication needs to be 
aligned to sustainability. The 
playbook basically is the “how.” 

What are the key recommendations?

Basically, there’s a role for marketing, 
there’s a role for storytelling. 
Brands need to make sure that 
everything they’re doing in 
sustainability is matched by what 
they’re putting out in the world.
Within the playbook, we spell 
that out, with [a set of] pillars of work.
First, how do we ensure we’re 

not greenwashing or putting 
forward anything in the way of 
misinformation? I’d say that’s kind 
of table stakes. This is not new to 
the industry, but unpacking it is 
quite complex and it’s evolving fast 
as more policy comes in.

96

Then we start moving into areas 
that are newer, and I think typically 
where the communication 
professional has more of a forte 
or skill set that can be brought to 
the table that hasn’t existed here 
previously. This is where we’re 
looking at culture change.

We clearly call out that we 
need to eradicate messages of 
overconsumption. This is probably 
the heaviest area [of what we are 
outlining] in terms of complexity 
in practice. Marketers are ‘KPI’d’ 
on how much they can sell, so this 
is going against that logic.

But we really present positive 

solutions. We’re not trying to do 
away with fashion as it exists, 
but change the focus of it. From a 
marketer’s standpoint, it’s about 
saying, how can we put more of our 
effort, energy, creativity, budget 
towards circular solutions? 

Can you outline what you mean 
by circular solutions?

Ultimately, you’ve got to start 
with people buying less, but then 
you might look at other ways of 
consumption — resale, rental, 
keeping what you’ve got for longer, 
so the repair market, with the last 
thing on the list being recycling 
before you buy something that’s 
completely new and unsustainable. 
There’s a lot of room within that 
for exploration, creativity.

And it is important here to 
recognise that there isn’t one size 
fits all. Sustainable consumption 
looks different in different 
markets. In some markets, we 
know that basic needs still need 
to be met, so we’re not asking for 
reduction in consumption as a 
blanket global view.

[But] the third section is about 
‘reimagine values,’ and this section 

The State of Fashion 2024could underpin all of it. We’re 
trying to inspire people to think 
and aspire to something different. 
We call [fashion marketers] 
‘architects of desire,’ so how can 
we redirect aspiration towards 
sustainable lifestyles? 

You’ve already alluded to the 
tension underlying this work: 
you’re essentially trying to 
encourage marketers to start 
selling something that is at odds 
with their current KPIs and 
where it’s not clear what the 
business model is. How does this 
fit with broader conversations 
around sustainability?

It is the elephant in the room. I 
think most businesses along that 
sustainability journey now recognise 
that, but that doesn’t mean they’re 
yet willing to address it at the board 
level or the senior executive level. 

This is new, not in the sense 
that nobody knows about it, but it’s 
not yet been a true conversation. 
What we have been trying to do 
with the playbook is to say this 
needs to be on the table. 

It’s not on the shoulders of 
those who work in a communication 
capacity, of course, but if you look 
at the bigger picture of what the 
playbook is talking about, it is 
addressing the system’s challenge, 
which is to say that we can push as 
hard as we possibly want with all of 
the evolution that is needed, but we 
won’t get anywhere within that if 
we don’t also look at volume. 

When we talk about systems, 
regulation often comes up as 
a lever for change. What role 
should policy play?

We’re seeing policy come down 
the line that is focused on the 
green claim side of things, but it 

Fashion System

is interesting starting to think 
about what that could look like 
from a sustainable consumption 
standpoint and what might be 
indeed possible within all of that.
The fourth section of the 
[playbook’s] principles is called 
‘drive advocacy.’ It looks at a 
couple of lenses. Obviously, how 
do we push for greater education 
from a broad consumer-based 
standpoint? Within that, 
we talk about the internal lever 
that communicators can help 
play to help ensure that there’s 
accountability for change within 
the business. Also [they can] 
help play a role within the policy 
landscape, recognising that a lot 
of these businesses are incredibly 
powerful and that there could 
be an opportunity from a very 
competitive standpoint to advocate 
for wider change that facilitates 
sustainability in a wider sense. 

How do you see the regulatory 
landscape at the moment?

There’s so many things going 
on within the policy landscape, 
which are interesting, potentially 
exciting, highly complex and 
bewildering for a lot of the 
industry to get their head around. 

The green claims side of things, 

the industry is kind of ready for 
it. Everybody just wants that 
guidance. Yes, there are going to 
be hurdles to actually get people 
on the right page, but just having 
black and white, ‘this is what you 
can and this is what you can’t do,’ 
it’s going to be really helpful for 
everybody. And it also helps level 
the playing field.

In a wider sense, I think we’re 
at an interesting juncture in terms 
of policymakers recognising this 
role of consumption as a result 

97

of unsustainable production. 
The waste side of things is a very 
interesting lever. We have to 
recognise in this conversation 
around overconsumption just how 
much waste there is in terms of the 
stuff that was [never sold].

What we also really need to see 
is incentives for businesses around 
doing ‘the right thing.’ On the one 
hand, that’s [encouraging the use 
of ] sustainable preferred materials 
so consumption that is happening 
is less impactful, but also do we 
push for circular solutions to be more 
easily facilitated or incentivised? 

I’m not sure that we’re seeing that 
play out fully as yet but I think all of 
those  things  combined  —  which  we 
know is not going to happen overnight 
— would be incredibly beneficial. 

Are things missing from the 
conversation, and in particular 
the policy conversation?

This elephant in the room around 
production levels and volume. 
It’s really interesting to think 
about what that looks like at a 
policy level. While we see certain 
regions looking at reducing, for 
instance, fast fashion, I think 
there’s a much bigger picture that 
isn’t necessarily in there, which is 
looking at consumption behaviour, 
and how that’s perpetuated by an 
overproduction model and how we 
look at that holistically in terms 
of the way that businesses are 
measured on success.

Lastly, the area that we don’t 
include as much as we should is 
around the worker side. How do 
we ensure that garment workers 
are being paid a living wage or 
the right amount for what they’re 
creating. What does that look like 
in a world of creating less?

Bullwhip
Snaps Back

Changes in consumer demand have resulted in the 
“bullwhip effect,” where cuts to orders increase 
in magnitude at different parts of a supply chain, 
putting pressure on fashion’s suppliers. Now, if supply 
is to keep pace with anticipated renewed demand, 
brands and retailers should consider focusing on 
transparency and bolstering  strategic partnerships.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  Demand volatility has disproportionately impacted upstream 

suppliers. Factories that were at full capacity in 2021 have been 
operating at 30 percent to 40 percent below capacity in 2023.

•  73 percent of chief procurement officers expect this volatility will 
be one of the top challenges affecting supplier relationships over 
the next five years.

•  Manufacturing experts believe the third quarter of 2024 may be 
the earliest that textile factories see capacity improvements.

Far  from  resolving  in  2024,  the  fashion  industry’s 
supply-chain  volatility  of  the  past  few  years  is 
set 
to  continue.  Upstream  apparel  suppliers 
and  manufacturers  have  undergone  significant 
disruption,  where  changes  in  consumer  demand 
have  resulted  recently  in  a  sharp  decline  in  factory 
utilisation,  widespread 
and  delayed 
investments. As brands and retailers look to scale up 
capacity to meet renewed demand, they may start to 
feel the repercussions of recent upstream strains.

layoffs, 

This turmoil is known as the “bullwhip effect,”326 
a phenomenon where changes in consumer demand 
escalate across the value chain. In the case of fashion, 
changes  in  consumer  demand  are  magnified  at 
each  step  from  retailers  to  garment  manufacturers 
to  yarn  and  raw  material  suppliers.  In  the  face 
of  falling  demand,  each  part  of  the  supply  chain 
overcompensates  by  reducing  forecasts,  lowering 

production  and  decreasing  order  volumes  —  often 
driven  by  communication  gaps  and  forecasting 
inaccuracies. 

The  bullwhip  effect  reached  fashion  in  2020 
and  2021  as  retailers  contended  with  pandemic-
related  disruptions  when  products  arrived  late 
and  overcompensated  for  inventory  shortages  by 
ordering  too  much  stock.  When  post-pandemic 
inflationary  pressures  and  economic  uncertainty 
arose in the second half of 2022, making consumers 
more  cautious  than  anticipated,  retailers  were  left 
with billions of dollars in unsold goods.327 As a result, 
many  orders  for  the  upcoming  2023  season  were 
reduced or cancelled.

The  pullback  has  disproportionately  impacted 
upstream  suppliers.  Across  seven  of  the  world’s 
biggest  textile  exporting  countries,  fabric  exports 
dropped nearly 20 percent in the last quarter of 2022

compared to the year prior, followed by a 40 percent 
drop  in  yarn  exports  in  the  first  quarter  of  2023.328 
Factories that were at full capacity in 2021 may have 
been  operating  at  30  percent  to  40  percent  below 
capacity  in  2023,  according  to  industry  experts.329 
It’s  a  similar  story  for  textile  machinery  players. 
Swiss  manufacturer  Rieter  reported  a  63  percent 
year-on-year drop in orders in the first half of 2023, 
citing weakening demand for spinning technology.330
Smaller  manufacturers  with  limited  resources 
have been the most affected. The managing director 
of a manufacturer in Pakistan estimated that as much 
as  30  percent  of  the  country’s  textile  factories  have 
closed.331  In  India,  spinning  mills  have  requested 
aid  from  the  government,332  while  many  operate  at 
a  loss.333  Other  manufacturing  hotspots  such  as  Sri 
Lanka and Vietnam have entirely shut operations in 
some factories.

The Bullwhip Snaps 

The  bullwhip  effect  has  only  made  more  urgent 
occurring  within 
crisis 
the 

humanitarian 

textile-producing  countries.  For  starters,  a  large 
share  of  textile  and  garment  workers  live  on  low 
wages  and  have  little  if  any  savings  to  fall  back 
on.  Today,  the  increased  stress  on  factories  could 
increase the risk of labour abuses, such as wage theft 
and union busting.

In  China,  the  world’s  largest  textile  producer, 
the  number  of  worker  strikes  and  protests  rose  in 
2023.334  According  to  the  China  Labour  Bulletin, 
more  than  700  factory  strikes  in  the  first  half  of 
2023 took place, compared to 800 in all of 2022. In 
Pakistan,  loss  of  cotton  crops  from  floods,  shifts  in 
production  and  lower  exports  contributed  to  over 
one million of its eight million textile workers losing 
jobs.  Textile  employment  levels  also  fell  by  tens  of 
thousands  in  key  markets  such  as  Bangladesh,  Sri 
Lanka, Cambodia and Turkey in 2023.335

This  supply-chain  volatility  is  not  expected  to 
subside in the near term. A McKinsey survey of chief 
procurement  officers  (CPOs)  in  September  2023 
found  that  73  percent  believe  demand  volatility 
will  be  one  of  the  top  challenges  to  affect  supplier 

100

Fashion System

relationships  over  the  next  five  years.336  However, 
the  third  quarter  of  2024  is  the  earliest  that  textile 
factories  might  see  some  capacity  improvement.337 
But  even  then,  the  consequences  of  the  bullwhip 
effect  may  continue  to  linger.  Layoffs  and  delayed 
investments may mean the industry is insufficiently 
prepared to scale up capacity quickly.

Worker  displacement  and  skills  loss  may  create 
major  challenges  for  the  industry.  In  Vietnam, 
for  example,  competition  for  qualified  labour  is 
intensifying  with  other  industries  —  suppliers  to 
Apple, Lego and automotive players are among those 
expanding  operations  and  attracting  former  textile 
workers  in  the  country.338  Factories  short  on  staff 
and dealing with hiring and training new employees 
could face longer production timelines. 

Brands and retailers not prepared for these shifts 
could  incur  higher  expenses  to  compensate  for  the 
potential delays. For example, they may need to pay 
for expedited shipping, overtime work or additional 
warehouse space. Those that try to rush production 
face other costs, such as increased quality issues that 
can damage a company’s reputation with consumers. 
Many  companies  are  rethinking  their  supply 
chains  to  de-risk  manufacturing.  According  to 
McKinsey’s  CPO  survey,  54  percent  of  executives 
expect  to  increase  reshoring  or  nearshoring  in 
2024.339  Others  are  thinking  about  rebalancing 
their  sourcing  footprint  by  sourcing  from  multiple 
countries.  However,  these  approaches  are  not 
without  challenges.  Finding  and  contracting  new 
suppliers,  or  partnering  more  closely  with  existing 
strategic  ones,  can  be  costly.  Companies  can  also 
run  into  manufacturing  limitations  compared  to 
traditional sourcing hubs or face new regulatory and 
compliance factors.

Another  consequence  of  the  slowdown  is  that 
suppliers have fallen behind in critical investments in 
new infrastructure for both speed and sustainability. 
More  than  70  percent  of  fashion’s  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  stem  from  upstream  activities,  such 
as  producing  and  finishing  textiles.340  Yet,  textile 
players  say  costs  are  high  for  upgrading  machinery 
or  adopting  greener  practices.341  Without  a  steady 
stream  of  orders,  they  are  postponing  capital 
expenditure  on  such  initiatives.  Unifi,  a  US-based 
manufacturer  of  recycled  and  synthetic  fibres,  has 
delayed machinery replacements from 2024 to 2026 
to offset slowing demand.342

With sustainability regulations coming into effect 
in  the  EU  and  elsewhere  that  mandate  companies 
disclose  environmental  impacts  in  their  supply 
chains,  and  the  push  from  investors  for  companies 
to disclose data about scope three emissions (that is, 
indirect emissions),343 the risk may only increase for 
brands and retailers.

Navigating Disruption

In  the  year  ahead,  brands  might  consider  placing 
greater  emphasis  on  making  their  supply  chains 
more  resilient  to  mitigate  future  risks.  First  and 
foremost,  transparency  and  communication  among 
all  stakeholders  in  the  supply  chain  will  likely 
be  paramount  in  facilitating  better  information-
sharing  and  joint  demand  forecasting.  According  to 
McKinsey’s survey, 70 percent of chief procurement 
officers believe that improving demand transparency 
with  suppliers  through  systems  and  processes  is 
critical in navigating market turmoil.344 

Cultivating  strategic  partnerships  with  key 
suppliers could also be considered and could include 
longer term contracts with not only direct suppliers, 
but  also  tier  two,  tier  three  and  tier  four  partners 
that  are  vital  to  a  business.  One  potential  benefit  of 
such a long-term commitment is that it can provide 
a  supplier  with  cash  flow  to  invest  in  industrial 
and  sustainability  improvements  at  its  facilities, 
according  to  Florian  Heubrandner,  executive  vice 
president of global textiles at Lenzing, a wood-based 
cellulosic fibre manufacturer.

Brands 

to  actively 
should  also  continue 
champion  workers’  rights.  This  includes  ensuring 
fair  wages,  job  protection,  safe  working  conditions 
and  opportunities  for  professional  development 
for  factory  workers.  Beyond  enabling  two-way 
communication with suppliers about this, companies 
can  take  steps  on  their  own.  Adidas,  among  other 
companies,  has  established  a  worker  hotline  to 
enable  workers  to  voice  complaints  that  it  can  then 
work to resolve.345 Similar initiatives include PVH’s, 
which  includes  setting  up  representative  workplace 
committees for all workers employed by key suppliers 
by 2025.346

The  upheavals  of  recent  years  have  made  clear 
that fashion companies and their suppliers not only 
depend  on  each  other  to  succeed,  but  also  endure 
challenges together. 2024 will likely provide further 
evidence as to why.

EXECUTIVE INTERVIEW

PVH Corp: 
Transforming Supply 
Chains Through Trust 
and Transparency

By Janet Kersnar

Fashion supply chains continue 
to experience the knock-on 
effects of wider geopolitical, 
macroeconomic and consumer 
shifts, all of which may intensify 
in 2024. David Savman believes 
there are multiple ways that 
retailers, brands and their 
suppliers can learn to thrive 
together in this environment.

102

David Savman,  
Chief Supply Chain 
Officer, PVH Corp

The State of Fashion 2024“

They thrive, we thrive” is a 

catchphrase that captures 
David Savman’s approach 

to running PVH’s supply chain. 
Since leaving H&M in 2022 to 
become the chief supply chain 
officer of the US owner of Tommy 
Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, Savman 
has put relationships front and 
centre across a supply chain that 
relies on around 300 garment 
manufacturers in approximately 
30 countries, building on PVH 
initiatives such as its first supply-
chain financing programme that 
provides suppliers with better 
financing rates based on their 
sustainability performance.
As he explains, having strong 
relationships across a supply chain 
“is the way we do business; it gives 
you a possibility to stand ready 
when whatever happens.”

After the turbulence caused 
by the Covid-19 pandemic, 
how would you characterise 
the impact on supply-chain 
relationships between brands, 
retailers and their suppliers?

It became clear during the 
pandemic which relationships 
were really strategically strong, 
transparent and reliable, and 
which ones were not. It is also clear 
that the suppliers that were able to 
use their relationships with brands 
and retailers to find more-[long-
term] solutions are the ones now 
working with the best [partners] 
in the market. There are a lot of 
brands and retailers out there, 
[and] it’s much more important 
for everyone to work with strong 
business partners from whatever 
side.

Both suppliers and retailers 
are more cautious in how each of 
us progresses. Who do you work 

Fashion System

with? Why do you work with 
them? What’s the value that we 
bring to the table? What’s our 
common goal? Are we equally 
vested in what we’re going after? It 
becomes much more obvious that 
it is a win-win relationship [when 
both partners] have answers 
to those questions [that align]. 
It’s part of a transformation in 
the way we think about supply-
chain partnerships for the last 
10 years, but the pandemic really 
accelerated that.

Even if you run your own 
company in a good way, there are 
still fluctuations in the market that 
affects the whole market, right? 
We want to be transparent both in 
terms of being up-front and candid 
about what we see changing, but 
also having frequent data flows to 
make sure we have the same view 
of reality all the time. Of course, 
that’s not super easy on a day-to-
day basis due to a lot of reasons.

In terms of the day to day, 
what are you doing to ensure 
the transformation you’ve 
mentioned continues to happen?

I’ve been in this industry and in 
this field for many, many years. I 
don’t think I’ve ever spoken to 
suppliers as much as I have in 
the last 10 months, first [because 
of ] being brand new at PVH, but 
also to build on what I’m hearing 
[about] what are their pain points, 
what works for them, what doesn’t 
work for them. How do we do this 
better? What is it that’s important 
for them to know? When do they 
actually need to know it?

What has surprised me 
through all of the conversations 
is seeing that there is still a big 
upside for the fashion retail 
industry to take bigger steps in 

how much more systematic and 
granular we need to be when we 
look at demand planning, supply 
planning, inventory management, 
regardless [of where we are based]. 
Each and every one of us has to be 
sharper [in all those areas], with 
supply models that are more agile, 
precise and diverse than before 
— everyone needs allocation 
algorithms that are flexible. 

You’ve mentioned inventory 
— how should companies 
be thinking of inventory 
management in the year ahead?

I think what the industry needs, 
and what we’re doing a lot at 
PVH, is [creating a mindset that] 
inventory is the most valuable 
asset we have, not only from a 
financial perspective, but also in 
terms of where capital is employed. 
… You can’t afford today to not 
make amazing products, at least 
not from where we stand. You 
also cannot afford to not be very 
granular in your demand planning, 
in your inventory planning, in 
your supply models, and really 
treat your inventory as the most 
precious thing you have. That’s 
where you put all your effort, your 
creativity. That’s how your brand 
comes to life with the consumer. 
It’s also how you run a sustainable, 
efficient business model around a 
fashion retailer.

Where will the conversations 
around offshoring, nearshoring 
and onshoring head? 

The important part of this is to ask 
why you do it, and that comes back 
to treating inventory as one of the 
most important things you have. 
To be able to have good inventory, 
take care of that inventory, make 
it available to your consumer and 

103

The solution is based on better data, 
but it’s also based on something as 
simple as trust.

be responsive, you need to have 
production in different parts of the 
world. We are a global company. So, 
it’s going to be nearshore to one 
market and far away from another 
one. 

I think that the [terms] 
nearshoring and onshoring 
are a bit un-modern in a global 
company. Does a global brand like 
PVH need a multiple country-
of-origin sourcing strategy to be 
able to run great availability with 
less inventory? Absolutely. Does 
it involve asking, ‘Am I going to 
nearshore?’ No. But it’s still a 
valid point that you need a diverse 
sourcing strategy, especially if 
you’re a brand active in every part 
of the world. 

For companies like PVH with 
supply chains that are global, 
a key part of sustainability — 
being able to trace where fibres 
and materials are sourced 
— is even more complex given 
the amount of information 
that needs to flow through 
multiple supply-chain tiers. 
Technology advances have 
helped, including the use of 
blockchain. But would you say 
advances in traceability and 
other moves towards more 
supply-chain sustainability 
would be accelerating now if it 
weren’t for regulators pressing 
for change?

It’s a tough question to answer. 
I don’t know if it’s accelerated 

or not. Probably. [But] it’s what 
the consumer wants. It’s what 
the store associates and your 
[other] staff want. It is what the 
shareholders and the financial 
markets want. We all want it to 
move as quickly as possible, so if 
anyone has managed to accelerate 
it, that’s … a positive thing. 

No one in this industry wants 

to hide where our fibres are 
from. That doesn’t exist. It’s just 
a complex thing. It’s how it has 
built up for hundreds of years. … It 
doesn’t come from bad intention, 
but now when we go back, there 
is untangling to do. A lot of them 
have already been done, and a lot 
of these technologies will help. 

There’s the critical human 
side of the supply chain that 
often doesn’t get discussed 
as much as it should. What 
can executives of retailers 
and brands do to uphold 
social rights in supply chains, 
regardless of economic cycles 
or headwinds that we might be 
facing in 2024? 

The answer is to run a much more 
granular, precise supply chain. If I 
go to my biggest suppliers and say, 
‘Here is how we see it, and we’re 
going to update you, and I’m going 
to do it on each and every level of 
the supply chain,’ I know that [the 
impact of any consumer demand 
shifts] is going to be smaller 
for everyone. If we talk to each 
other often enough and we have a 

104

strong strategic relationship, you 
trust that what I say is accurate. 
Therefore, you won’t add 20 percent, 
or you won’t remove 20 percent, 
from your operations. In contrast, 
if you don’t trust me and you do 
add upside or remove downside, 
the next level will do the same.

The problem is when you don’t 
have this, they’re sitting blind, and 
then if all of a sudden demand 
totally disappears, or triples, they 
struggle to handle it, and this 
will impact their employees. The 
solution is based on better data 
and integrated systems, but it’s 
also based on something as simple 
as trust, and making sure that 
you do what you say you’re going 
to, if you do that over and over ... 
they’re with you on that journey. 
That builds the possibility for 
them to continue to grow their 
business. It’s like it’s the absolutely 
best thing that can happen to us, 
that our suppliers continue to 
thrive, and invest in innovation, 
sustainable solutions, circularity, 
technology and so on. The day they 
don’t, then I’m troubled.

Resilience Buoyed 
by Luxury

The fashion industry demonstrated remarkable 
resilience in 2022. The luxury segment in particular 
propelled growth through price increases, offsetting 
the weaknesses of other segments. However, the 
future remains unclear against a backdrop of ongoing 
headwinds, from geopolitical tensions, inflationary 
pressures and slumping consumer confidence to the 
Chinese economy’s slower-than-expected recovery.

KEY INSIGHTS

•  After a record 2021, industry economic profit stabilised at similar levels in 2022, with 
macro challenges offset by strong revenues and cost discipline which protected 
margins. 

• 

Excluding luxury and affordable luxury, however, the industry’s 2022 performance 
would have been negative, with the mid-market segment particularly under pressure. 
In luxury, there were also clear winners: about 98 percent of the luxury segment’s total 
economic profit was generated by the four largest players.

•  Value creators outnumbered value destroyers for the second year in a row. However, 

there are signs of increased polarisation, with the industry’s “Super Winners” 
increasing their share of economic profit from 84 percent to 99 percent. 

• 

• 

In this year’s list of Super Winners, luxury group LVMH rose to the number one spot. 
Sportswear players continued to perform strongly amid a reshuffling of the pack, led 
by Nike in second place.

The industry faced economic uncertainty and diminished consumer confidence 
in 2023. However, it is likely it will maintain its economic profitability for the year, 
primarily thanks to the resilient luxury segment.

Leveraging  financial  data  from  nearly  400  public 
companies,  the  McKinsey  Global  Fashion  Index 
(MGFI)  helps  decision  makers  evaluate  the  fashion 
industry’s  most 
important  segments,  product 
categories  and  markets.  The  index  primarily  tracks 
financial  development  and  value  creation  through 
the  lens  of  economic  profit  (EP),  calculated  as  the 
difference  between  a  company’s  current  adjusted 
operating profit (minus taxes) and its cost of capital. 
EP  also  reflects  value  created  over  time,  allowing 
the  index  to  gauge  how  much  a  company  invests  to 
generate its results. 

In  this  eighth  edition  of  the  MGFI,  we  first 
unpack the industry’s historical EP composition and 
development,  then  we  analyse  individual  segments, 
showing where value was created or eroded. We look 
at  the  performance  of  companies  that  have  risen 
to  the  top  as  “Super  Winners,”  unpack  a  crisis  in 
inventories and share our outlook for the coming year.

107

Resilient Performance

The  fashion  industry  achieved  a  strong  financial 
performance  in  2022,  led  by  the  luxury  segment’s 
economic  profit  contribution.  EP  held  steady  near 
the  high-tide  level  created  in  2021,  suggesting 
stabilisation  and  reflecting  a  recovery  in  consumer 
sentiment  as  pandemic  effects  started  to  fade.  Our 
EP index, baselined to 100 in 2010, hit 203 at the end 
of  2022,  just  12  points  lower  than  the  record  set  in 
2021.

challenges, 

Industry  performance  was  resilient  despite 
significant 
geopolitical 
uncertainty (such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine) 
and  accelerating  inflation,  which  put  disposable 
income  under  heavy  pressure.  The 
industry 
generated  revenue  gains  while  keeping  a  firm  grip 
on costs, leading to average adjusted EBITA margins 
of almost 12 percent, slightly ahead of the 11 percent 
long-term average. Capital intensity, which refers to

the  assets  required  to  generate  income,  decreased 
6  percent  compared  to  2019,  despite  a  significant 
increase in revenues of 12 percent. Decision makers 
were hesitant to commit to significant investments, 
resulting in a relatively modest 4 percent increase in 
capital investment since 2019. 

The  key  to  the  industry’s  relatively  strong 
performance  in  2022  was  pricing-led  growth.  The 
luxury segment in particular showed that it can raise 
prices  without  significantly  impacting  demand.347 
Large players were most proficient at managing these 
price  rises.  However,  price  adjustments  were  not 
restricted  to  the  top  end  of  the  market.  Companies 
including  Inditex  and  Uniqlo  have  shown  that 
implementing  well-managed  pricing  strategies  can 
effectively support profitability.348 349

Our analysis of industry dynamics over the past 

three  years  (2019-2022)  suggests  that  high  levels  of 
EP can be largely attributed to margin performance. 
McKinsey’s  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  margin 
was  twice  as  important  as  capital  turn  in  shaping 
EP  trajectory.  A  1.3  percentage  point  improvement 
in  margins  from  2019  to  2022  was  the  main  driver 
sustaining the current elevated EP levels.

Luxury on Top

In  a  year  of  economic  challenges  and  accelerating 
inflation,  only  two  segments  were  able  to  improve 
on their performance in 2021. Luxury and affordable 
luxury  saw  average  EP  rise  36  percent  and  10 
percent respectively — a result reflecting successful 
repricing strategies and the resilient spending power 
of  higher-income  consumers.  Due  to  the  uncertain 
environment,  shopping  behaviours  have  further

diverged,  with  high-income  shoppers  broadly 
maintaining their spending on fashion while lower-
income consumers cut discretionary spending.350 It is 
worth noting that while affordable luxury improved 
its  year-on-year  EP,  the  segment  only  amounts 
to  a  small  portion  of  the  market.  Meanwhile,  the 
premium/bridge,  mid-market  and  value/discount 
segments suffered. 

In a bell curve pattern, the extremes of premium/
bridge  and  value/discount  suffered  less  than  the 
middle  ground,  seeing  20  percent  declines  in  EP 
compared  with  a  mid-market  EP  decline  of  34 
percent (including Inditex) and 64 percent (excluding 
Inditex).  That  said,  the  mid-market  still  produced 
more  EP  in  aggregate  than  its  long-term  average, 
recording  an  EP  index  level  of  37,  compared  with 
15  on  average  between  2010  and  2018.  Premium/

bridge  and  value/discount  also  outperformed  their 
long-term averages but by smaller amounts. 

While  affordable  luxury  recorded  a  10  percent 
EP gain in 2022, the segment was unable to improve 
on  its  2010-2018  average.  Luxury,  however,  reached 
new  highs,  more  than  quadrupling  its  long-term 
2010-2018  average.  Luxury  now  accounts  for  nearly 
half  of  the  industry’s  total  EP,  with  an  EP  index  of 
90.  Its  performance  would  have  been  even  more 
exceptional if online pure players were omitted from 
the  analysis.  These  pure  players  generally  posted 
negative  or  much  lower  levels  of  EP.  Meanwhile, 
premium/bridge  and  mid-market  produced  an  EP 
index of 42 and 37 respectively, while value/discount 
achieved 30.

Among  individual  luxury  companies,  LVMH 
posted a record performance, with revenue of €79.2

Segment Deep Dive: Luxury

Luxury has experienced extremely rapid 

growth in recent years, and its EP is now six 

times 2010 levels, accounting for 44 percent 

of the industry’s total. This growth trajectory 

continued in 2022, with luxury EP growing 

36 percent, spurred by record EBITA margins 

of 25 percent. Still, growth is expected to 

stabilise amid macroeconomic headwinds 

and slower growth in China.

EP in luxury (including publicly listed 

companies only) is driven by just four players: 

LVMH, Hermès, Richemont and Kering. These 

powerhouses accounted for 98 percent of 

the segment’s EP in 2022, although the first 

signs of growth normalisation are beginning 

to emerge in 2023.371 Of the four, Kering 

recorded the smallest EP growth. 

billion  (approximately  $83  billion)  and  profit  from 
recurring  operations  of  €21.1  billion  ($22  billion), 
both  up  23  percent  year  on  year.351  Hermès  also 
had  an  exceptional  year,  with  a  29  percent  increase 
in  revenue.352  These  results  partially  reflected  the 
primacy of companies that were able to secure higher 
prices while maintaining strong demand. 

The  strong  performance  of  the  luxury  segment 
was evident in both margins and revenues. Luxury’s 
average  adjusted  EBITA  margin  widened  from 
the  pre-pandemic  historical  average  by  about  5 
percentage  points,  and  1  percentage  point  from 
2021,  to  25.2  percent.  This  was  on  the  back  of  an 
18  percent  increase  in  revenues,  driven  partly  by 
price  increases.  Elsewhere,  margins  held  steady  or 
were  slightly  narrower.  For  example,  mid-market 
margins  contracted  to  8.3  percent  from  9.7  percent 
the  previous  year.  Value/discount  margins  of  9.5 
percent  were  about  2  percentage  points  lower 
than  pre-pandemic,  partly  driven  by  strong  price 
competition and increases in the cost of goods sold. 

Value Creation and Destruction

To be sure, the fashion industry has had to contend 
with myriad challenges in recent years. Even before 
the  pandemic,  a  relatively  small  group  of  players 
was  responsible  for  generating  the  majority  of  EP. 
The pandemic led to weaker performance across the 
board, albeit with exceptions. Now, there are signs of a 
return to the traditional pattern of polarisation, with 
the  top  20  percent  of  companies  driving  industry 
EP. This group saw a slight increase in overall profit 
contribution  of  4  percentage  points,  accounting  for 
125 percent of the industry’s EP at the end of 2022.

Meanwhile,  the  bottom  20  percent  accounted 
for  most  of  the  industry’s  losses,  equivalent  to  an 
EP  of  negative  30  percent  compared  to  negative  25 
percent  in  2021.  Still,  the  cohort  was  significantly 
less  value  destructive  than  pre-pandemic,  with  an 
improvement of approximately 50 percentage points 
since  2019.  In  the  middle,  a  small  amount  of  EP  (5 
percent  of  the  distribution)  was  produced  by  60 
percent of companies.

110

The State of Fashion 2024McKinsey Global Fashion Index

The  long-term  trend  in  the  fashion  industry 
has  been  that  there  are  more  value  destroyers  than 
value  creators.  In  2021,  that  started  to  change  as 
value destroyers faltered, resulting in bankruptcies, 
mergers  and  acquisitions.  The  proportion  of  value 
destroyers fell to 45 percent, compared to 68 percent 
in  2020,  marking  the  first  year  since  2014  that 
creators outnumbered destroyers. In the most recent 
financial year, the new equilibrium remained stable, 
with  destroyers  accounting  for  a  share  only  slightly 
higher than the previous year at 47 percent. Luxury 
and  affordable  luxury  saw  the  highest  number  of 
new  value  creators,  while  the  mid-market  saw  the 
highest  number  of  new  value  destroyers.  Prada  is 
an example of a new value creator, with a 21 percent 
increase  in  revenues  in  2022  driven  by  growing 
brand  momentum,  particularly  for  youth-focused 
Miu Miu.353 However, mid-market players accounted 
for about 50 percent of the value destruction in 2022. 
In 2022, the top 20 companies saw EP levels rise 
on  aggregate,  and  the  group  continued  to  have  an 
outsized impact on overall EP. But of the 99 percent 
of  EP  attributable  to  the  top  20,  81  percent  was 
generated  by  the  top  10.  That  said,  value  creators 
outside the top 20 contributed more to EP than they 
did  for  most  of  the  past  decade.  Meanwhile,  value 
destroyers  were  proportionately  less  destructive, 
with a similar EP level to previous years representing 
a smaller proportion of total EP.

Super Winners 

It  is  no  secret  that  fashion  is  a  winner-takes-all 
industry,  with  the  top  companies  dominating 
the  global  value  pool.  This  year,  our  list  of  Super 
Winners  contains  five  new  entrants,  reflecting 
shifts  in  consumer  behaviour  after  the  Covid-19 
pandemic.  Meanwhile,  four  of  the  top  seven  are 
luxury  companies,  highlighting  the  importance  of 
the  segment.  Also,  sportswear  saw  a  recalibration 
while some retailers rebounded.

In the luxury segment, LVMH was the standout 
performer,  rising  one  place  to  take  the  top  spot, 
achieving  significant  growth  particularly  in  its 
fashion and leather goods category in Europe, US and 
Japan.  The  next-best  performing  luxury  player  was 
Hermès,  which  rose  from  fifth  to  fourth  place  due 
to  its  strong  performance  in  international  markets, 
while  Richemont  jumped  three  places  to  fifth, 
with  growth  driven  by  momentum  in  retail  and  the 

Americas.354  Kering  was  seventh  and  Tapestry  rose 
13 places to 16th.

Leisure  and  sportswear  brands  saw  positive 
momentum  as  consumers  continued  to  prioritise 
healthy 
lifestyles.  However,  with  more  people 
returning  to  the  office  as  well  as  spending  time 
outdoors,  the  picture  was  slightly  more  mixed  than 
last  year.  China’s  Anta  moved  from  ninth  to  11th 
place.  On  the  flipside,  Lululemon  rose  from  11th  to 
10th  position,  boosted  by  a  net  revenue  increase 
of  30  percent,  attributed  to  product  innovation,  a 
focus on consumer experiences and strategic market 
expansion.355  Retailers  including  Dicks  Sporting 
Goods and JD Sports remained on the list, with the 
former holding steady in 12th place, while JD moved 
down four places to 19th. 

Elsewhere, the past year saw strong performance 
by  off-price  multi-brand  retailers,  including  TJX 
Companies and Ross. TJX remained in sixth place on 
the Super Winners, and Ross was ninth, rising from 
eighth place last year. 

Macy’s was the biggest mover in the group, rising 
321  places  to  secure  the  20th  spot  on  the  list.  Four 
other  new  entrants  also  made  the  list,  including 
American  department  store  Dillard’s  climbing  21 
places to claim the 13th position. These department 
stores experienced a strong rebound post-pandemic 
in  2021,  reflecting  consumers’  eagerness  to  return 
to  in-person  shopping  after  lockdowns  and  social 
distancing  measures  were  lifted.  However,  despite 
a  range  of  actions  taken  by  department  stores, 
including  Macy’s  restructuring  efforts  announced 
in  2020356  and  Dillard’s  tight  inventory  control 
strategy,357  the  business  model  remains  challenged, 
with many experiencing a growth slowdown or even 
decline in sales during the financial year 2022. New 
entrant  Tapestry  climbed  13  places  to  16th,  with 
performance  attributed  to  the  momentum  of  its 
key  brands  such  as  Coach  and  Kate  Spade  as  well 
as  the  execution  of  its  “acceleration  programme” 
to  cut  costs  and  improve  margins.358  359  Footwear 
manufacturer  Crocs  reached  17th  place,  climbing 
from  24th  last  year,  after  record  2022  revenues  as 
a  result  of  exceptional  demand  for  the  Crocs  and 
Heydude  brands.360  Lastly,  Signet  Jewelers,  the 
world’s  largest  diamond  jewellery  retailer,  saw  a 
significant  50  percent  increase  in  fiscal  2022  sales, 
driven  by  a  56  percent  growth  in  brick-and-mortar 
sales, resulting in an upward move from 33rd to 18th

It  would  be  tempting  to  assume  that  the  ability 
to produce EP is highly correlated with a company’s 
size. However, while size matters, it was not the only 
factor influencing this year’s results. Super Winners 
contributed almost 18 times more EP than the average 
fashion company. Not only was such a significant gap 
in EP due to the Super Winners’ revenue, which is on 
average  six  to  seven  times  higher  than  the  average 
of  the  wider  cohort,  but  also  their  relative  margin 
performance. Overall, Super Winners demonstrated 
a  margin  performance  contribution  with  an  EP-to-
revenue ratio of around 8.6 percent, compared to 3.4 
percent for the wider group.

With  every  company  joining  the  Super  Winner 
list, there is a company exiting it. Dropping out of the 
top  20  in  2022  were  Adidas,  Hanesbrands,  Li  Ning, 
Deckers Outdoors and VF Corp. 

Inventory Headaches 

During  the  pandemic,  inventory  levels  increased 
significantly  due  to  changes  in  consumer  behaviour 
and supply chain disruptions. As the industry began 
to recover in 2021, inventory value-to-revenue levels 
returned  to  around  19.6  percent,  in  line  with  the 
pre-pandemic  average  from  2015  to  2018.  However, 
in  the  past  year,  inventory  levels  have  risen  again, 
reflecting economic pressure and continuing supply 
chain  disruptions.  In  2022,  the  average  inventory 
value-to-revenue ratio was higher than pre-pandemic 
levels, with a particularly concerning situation in the 
fourth  quarter  when  the  traditional  holiday-season 
clear-out failed to materialise. 

When  examining  segment  performance,  there 
was  a  clear  divide  between  luxury  and  non-luxury. 
Luxury  typically  maintains  higher  inventory  levels 
compared  to  non-luxury,  reflecting  the  fact  that 
many  luxury  players  have  high-priced  items  that 
sell  less  frequently,  a  higher  share  of  permanent 
collections  and  apply  less  discounting,  thus  holding 
on  to  more  inventory.  During  the  pandemic,  luxury 
inventories  peaked  largely  due  to  store  closures,

companies could scale back inventories to below the

Segment Deep Dive: Sportswear

Sportswear grew rapidly during the pandemic, driven 

by consumer demand for comfortable, stay-at-home 

clothing and a focus on fitness and wellness. From 

2010 to 2021, sportswear grew to 3.5 times the size, 

with growth at double the rate of the overall fashion 

industry (excluding luxury), and even generated 

positive EP in 2020. Although EP has decreased by 

approximately 17 percent since its peak in 2021, 2022 

remained a promising year for sportswear, becoming 

its second most profitable year in the last decade. 

Historically, sportswear has been a “two horse race,” 

between giants Nike and Adidas. Due to pandemic-

related growth and Adidas’ challenges, new players 

have gained ground. Nike remains the leader, despite 

growth plateauing in 2022, with EP twice as large as 

it was in 2019. Emerging players, such as Lululemon, 

Deckers or On, have differentiated strategies and 

propositions. Lululemon has a leading position in 

the lifestyle space, while specialised companies 

like Deckers (which owns Hoka) and On have risen 

to prominence in the running space, offering new 

materials, technology and designs for consumers 

focused on performance wear. In addition, Anta, an 

established player, improved its performance through 

substantial growth in China, particularly with its 

flagship brand Fila. Anta also led a consortium that 

acquired Amer Sports in 2019, supporting its ambitious 

growth plans to elevate Arc’teryx, Salomon and Wilson 

into billion-euro brands.372 

2022. As a result, inventories remained bloated, with 
levels  higher  than  the  2015  to  2018  average,  driven 
by unpredictable consumer demand. The industry’s 
surplus  inventory  created  a  prime  opportunity  for 
off-price  retailers  like  TJX,  Ross  and  Burlington  to 
acquire  excess  goods  at  a  substantial  discount.362 
However,  these  retailers  faced  their  own  inventory 
hurdles, resulting in a significantly higher inventory 
value-to-revenue  ratio  that  approached  pandemic 
levels.  This  trend  started  to  improve  towards  the 
end  of  2022,  showing  signs  of  inventory  levels 
normalising.

the  general 

One  exception 

trend  was 
sportswear,  where  surging  demand  during  the

the 

luxury 

17  percent  growth  in  the  first  half  of  2023  and 
Hermès  25  percent.364  Outside  the  Super  Winner 
list,  Prada,  Hugo  Boss  and  Moncler  posted  revenue 
gains  of  20  percent,  22  percent  and  24  percent 
respectively.365  However, 
industry 
appears  to  be  experiencing  growth  normalisation 
driven by signs of a slowdown in the US and tighter 
economic conditions in China. LVMH announced its 
third quarter results in October 2023, resulting in a 
share price drop of 7 percent, putting the share price 
down almost 25 percent since April. Luxury groups 
Kering  and  Richemont  also  felt  the  impact,  falling 
more  than  2  percent  and  4  percent,  respectively.366 
367  Sportswear  also  showed  signs  of  resilience.  On, 
Asics and Lululemon reported second quarter 2023 
revenues  of  52  percent,  29  percent  and  18  percent 
respectively.368  Sportswear  giant  Nike  saw  better-
than-expected  first  quarter  results  in  September 
2023, indicating that demand remains strong despite 
consumer  challenges.369  Meanwhile,  travel  is  high 
on  consumer  agendas,  reflecting  a  post-pandemic 
appetite  for  new  experiences.  As  a  result,  luggage 
specialist  Samsonite  had  a  good  first  half,  seeing 
revenue gains of 40 percent compared to 2022.370 

One  reassuring  trend  is  that  the  industry  has 
been  able  to  maintain  its  margins,  which  averaged 
15  percent  in  the  first  half  of  2023  (for  unadjusted 
EBITA) — just 0.2 percentage points lower than the 
year  prior.  Again,  luxury  was  the  primary  driver  of 
performance,  sustaining  average  margins  of  more 
than 25 percent. In other segments, average margins 
were  around  11  percent.  Analysts  expect  margins 
to  hold  steady  over  the  remainder  of  2023  and  into 
2024.  However,  this  comes  with  a  warning  that  the 
recovery is fragile.

Based  on  revenue  and  profitability  trajectories, 
and  our  review  of  expert  analysis,  the  most  likely 
path  forward  is  for  the  industry  to  hold  steady  over 
the coming period. That means the MGFI cohort will 
likely broadly maintain EP levels thanks to a strong 
luxury  segment.  However,  the  current  uncertain 
economic  environment  could  potentially  lead  to 
further deterioration in performance before the end 
of  the  year,  putting  struggling  players  under  even 
greater pressure, further increasing EP polarisation.

Segment Deep Dive: 
Online Pure Players

After 2021’s highs, the online pure play 

segment came down to earth with a bump. 

In 2022, the online market stagnated or 

contracted in some regions, exposing players 

that were previously lauded for their focus 

on growth rather than profitability. Amid high 

interest rates and investor demands, online 

pure players have shifted their focus from 

growth and market share gains to improving 

their bottom lines. Luxury specialists such as 

MyTheresa and Farfetch faced bottom-line 

challenges, despite the growth of the luxury 

market. Meanwhile, mass-market businesses 

such as Boohoo, Zalando, Asos and About You 

posted negative EP, amid intense competition 

from third-generation fast-fashion players 

such as Temu and Shein.373 Other headwinds 

included inventory pressures, supply chain 

disruptions and high return rates.

some companies from falling into an inventory trap. 
With year-on-year revenues under pressure in 2022, 
inventories  expanded  in  the  third  quarter  without 
declining materially by the end of the year.

On the Horizon

In  the  coming  year,    the  dampening  effect  of  the 
economic environment on consumer sentiment will 
likely  continue.  This  will  put  pressure  on  brands  to 
deliver value for money, as well as standout customer 
experiences.  Meanwhile,  China’s 
slower-than-
expected  recovery  suggests  a  persistent  constraint 
on demand.

looms 

At  the  time  of  writing,  the  macroeconomic 
situation is in a state of flux. There are tentative signs 
that the worst of the post-pandemic effects is abating, 
and  inflation  is  softening  in  many  economies.

the strongest performers were in the luxury segment, 
which saw 14 percent growth, while the mid-market, 
premium/bridge  and  value/discount 
segments
