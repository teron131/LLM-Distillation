Energy organizations in 
transition

Organizations in the energy sector are evolving in response to the 
energy quadrilemma. With critical choices and challenges on the 
horizon, making proactive moves now could determine future success.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024The coming decade will be a defining moment for the 
global energy system. Institutional and public interest 
is at an all-time high, driven by the ever-increasing 
need for affordable, reliable, secure, and competitive 
energy. Companies must navigate the task of 
maintaining a strong, high-return “traditional” core, 
while building businesses in the fast-moving, high-
growth space of renewables, low-carbon solutions, 
power, and retail. This challenge demands bold 
action and innovative solutions, as we work toward a 
sustainable energy future that benefits our planet and 
our economies.

For the world, solving this energy quadrilemma 
will require significant investment, technological 
advancements, and a favorable operating 
environment. However, at the heart of this journey are 
energy organizations and their leaders. Being fast, 
agile, and efficient will be essential as competition 
for talent intensifies, integration of mergers and 
acquisitions becomes crucial for value creation, and 
generative AI (gen AI) changes the workplace as we 
know it.

In this report, we build on our flagship cross-industry 
State of Organizations research and take a closer look 
at the State of Energy Organizations.¹ We identify and 
explore four key themes for energy companies in the 
coming year: operating models, leadership, talent, and 
mergers and acquisitions, with reflective questions 
for organizations to consider as they navigate through 
2024 and beyond.

Choices to define the next decade 

Over the past 18 months we have seen several 
energy companies announce strategic adjustments 
that reemphasize the importance of their traditional 
core businesses. This reflects the growing 
importance of energy reliability and security, as 
well as slower than expected cash flows from 
new energy businesses. Against this backdrop, 
companies are recognizing that now is the time to 

maximize value creation in the traditional business, 
grow cash flows, and take advantage of the high 
returns. However, as this momentum grows, an 
old question has resurfaced: business unit- or 
function-first for the traditional core business?

What primary axis should be 
used for the traditional core?  

The choice between business unit (BU)—whether 
asset, regional, or value chain—or function-centric as 
the primary organizational axis has been a hot topic 
for several decades, with many companies switching 
between these models over time. 

The choice of model essentially reflects a fundamental 
belief about how a company creates distinctive value: 
on the one hand, a functional model enables you to 
optimize across portfolios, and drive global scale, 
standardization, and functional excellence. On the 
other, anchoring ownership in the BU incentivizes local 
optimization, aiming to capture value in each and every 
facility, with the potential to move more quickly and 
unlock significant growth. 

Over the past year, we have seen an increasing 
number of companies begin to revisit this choice 
and we expect this to be a growing theme through 
2024. To contribute to this debate, we reviewed 
over 20 years of McKinsey proprietary performance 
datasets to draw insights linking asset performance 
with operating model choices. We found, on average, 
that BU or asset-centric models have the edge in 
terms of operational performance, but that they can 
compromise on consistency and produce a wider 
range of outcomes on both operating cost and 
production efficiency. 

Irrespective of the choice made, companies can also 
go back to basics by focusing on some fundamental 
step changes across their operating model: radical 
simplification, value-backed technology deployment,

close the productivity gap. 

blockbuster successes; the remainder were partial 
successes at best.²

Additionally, we are observing a trend of companies 
going even deeper into their operating model—
reimagining both technical and nontechnical support 
models. Naturally, gen AI and digital will play a leading 
role, however, many companies are rethinking their 
geographic footprint, tapping into large engineering 
talent markets, and revisiting their operating models 
for technology development and deployment to ride 
the next technology S-curve. 

Key questions to consider

•  Do you have the right tension between a BU-      
and function-centric organization to deliver      
your ambitions?

•  What are the big unlocks in 2024 that would      

Overcoming these odds will not be easy and 
the fundamental question is how to harness the 
advantages of being an incumbent while providing the 
freedom to deliver with the agility of a start-up. 

The answer is not the same for all; however, purposeful 
decisions are needed sooner rather than later to 
deliver on the growth promised to investors.

Key questions to consider

•  At the strategic level (including capital allocation) 
how autonomous should your new energy 
business be?

•  What are the right key success factors that will 
enable your new energy business to grow?

drive performance?

•  What are the right architecture, corporate 

•  How could changes to your geographic        

footprint or technology operating model enable 
stronger performance?

Should new energy businesses 
be integrated in or independent 
from the core?

Most energy players have ambitions to grow new 
energy businesses alongside enjoying continued 
success in their existing core. These twin objectives 
require winning simultaneously in very different 
markets, with different drivers of success and, 
therefore, different operating model needs. As a result, 
we see energy companies around the world grappling 
with profound questions over how to set up their 
organization to win in both worlds.

First, the bad news. The data shows that most 
corporate new business builds are not a great success. 
Just 16 percent of all new business builds in Fortune 
100 companies since 2000 have turned out to be 

functions, technical support, midstream gas or 
trading decisions that will set your new energy 
business up for success?

What are the talent and leadership 
needs for a new era?

The focus over recent years has been to secure 
specialist engineering, digital, and commercial talent 
to develop new businesses and capabilities. This 
challenge remains alive, and competition for talent 
continues to be fierce. 

However, a new challenge of equal proportion is 
bubbling under the surface: the need to retain and 
refresh the skill base to sustain the existing core 
business. This challenge will grow in prominence 
against a backdrop of significant retirements, with 
400,000 oil and gas employees in the United States 
approaching retirement, and the increasingly negative 
perception of the traditional energy sector among 
younger workers in some parts of the world.³

5

The State of Energy Organizations 2024The good news for employers in the new energy space 
is that knowledge, expertise, and competencies 
gained in more traditional energy businesses 
are relatively easily transferred. However, this 
transferability further compounds the challenges in 
retaining and attracting talent to the historic core. 

To enhance their attractiveness to the talent market, 
many firms are reevaluating their employee value 
proposition (EVP), focusing on creating broader, or 
faster career opportunities, reshaping the corporate 
culture, and changing the perceptions of senior 
leaders. At the same time, many firms are broadening 
their accessible talent market, taking advantage 
of the global talent pool to strengthen their bench. 
Whichever way this challenge is addressed, it seems 
that early and purposeful moves in 2024 may position 
firms ahead of their peers for the next decade.

Beyond the talent squeeze, leaders hold a unique 
position in the journey ahead. The leaders of today are 
shaped by their traditional business and corporate 
histories; however, what lies ahead will be different 
in terms of challenges and opportunities—and 
only accelerated through the emergence of new 
technologies like gen AI. These will place different 
demands on leaders and require an evolved 
leadership model.

Our survey of over 140 senior leaders indicates the 
change needed as leaders move from a “traditional 
leadership” style prioritizing elements such as 
planning, directing, and controlling to an “emerging 
leadership” approach that values a visionary style 
where leaders act as an architect, catalyst, and coach. 
Achieving this goes far beyond defining desired 
leadership behaviors and running development 
programs, but into the DNA of corporations—requiring 
a culture and operating system that reinforces and 

rewards the desired behaviors rather than hindering 
or—worst of all—punishing them.

Key questions to consider

•  Do you have sufficient strategic talent plans for the 
next five years, and do they take advantage of the 
global talent market?

•  Does your EVP fit the modern expectations             

of employees?

•  Do you and your leaders understand the 

transformation ahead and are you ready for it?

How do you create value from 
M&A in an era of consolidation?

Operators are already taking advantage of the high 
cash flows generated in the latest market cycle, 
with many pulling the traditional levers of capital 
management, shoring up their balance sheets, and 
returning cash to shareholders. 

However, we are already seeing the next wave of M&A 
activity globally, with a high likelihood of acceleration 
in 2024.4 Oil and gas is moving with this trend, with 
recent megadeals such as ExxonMobil–Pioneer 
Natrural Resources, Chevron–Hess, and  
Occidental Petroluem–CrownRock LP, with new 
energies following closely behind with a more 
programmatic approach.5

Executing the deal is one thing, and for many, 
acquisitions are seen internally as “bread and 
butter,” however, more than 50 percent of deals in 
the exploration and production sector don’t create 
value for shareholders.6 As we begin the next wave of 
M&As, it is clear that it must be different—the creation 
of value will underpin success, with organizational 
unlocks at the center.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024 
There are three characteristics we observe to 
create value in both the short- and long-term. First, 
integration—capturing value far beyond general and 
administrative expense synergies is critical. The best 
use the moment of transaction to catalyze a step 
change in performance across all levers and create 
an inherent “deal and integration machine” to deliver 
value creating integrations over and over again. 
Second, enabling long-term growth by selecting the 
right end-state operating model, striking the right 
balance between dependent and independent.  
Third, focusing on managing culture from the very  
start of the M&A process is important to delivering  
long-term success.

Key questions to consider 

•  Do you have the inherent capability to build the 
“deal and integration machine” required?

•  How can new opportunities be catalyzed at the 
point of integration to realize step changes  
in performance?

•  How will you make the right decision when 
selecting the end-state operating model?

What role can gen AI perform 
for energy organizations?

Gen AI has the potential to revolutionize the energy 
industry by enabling more efficient operations, 
better decision making, and improved resource 
management. Potential applications include data 
analysis and interpretation, predictive maintenance, 
and virtual monitoring and simulation—among many 
more yet to be imagined. 

Gen AI can analyze large volumes of data from sources 
such as seismic surveys, well logs, and production logs 
to identify patterns, anomalies, and correlations that 

can help optimize production, reservoir modeling, and 
allow for higher quality decision making. It can analyze 
sensor data and historical maintenance records to 
predict equipment failures and recommend proactive 
maintenance actions to improve operational efficiency, 
reduce downtime, and improve safety. 

The technological side of the equation is complex 
but may not be the biggest challenge. There will be a 
huge impact on people: the capabilities and skills they 
need and how their day-to-day jobs might change. 
The introduction of gen AI could lead to the evolution 
of existing job roles and the emergence of new 
ones. It opens up amazing opportunities as well as 
challenges. To make the most of both, it will be critical 
to stay ahead of the trend and plan for how this may 
impact your people model and require investments in 
reskilling and upskilling parts of the workforce. 

Key questions to consider

•  What proportion of jobs will be significantly 
exposed to automation due to gen AI in the  
next decade? 

•  What impact does gen AI have on the capabilities 
needed in your workforce in the coming decade?

•  Do you have a plan in place to close the capability 

gap and capture the gen AI revolution?

Faced with change—and opportunity—on several 
fronts, energy organizations have critical choices to 
make to shape their future in a low-carbon world. 
Thinking strategically now about operating models, 
leadership, talent, and M&A could position energy 
organizations to evolve ahead of these major trends. 
Those who don’t plan now risk being left behind.

New energy businesses: 
The independence 
versus integration 
dilemma

Energy majors set ambitious targets for new energy businesses  
(renewables, CCUS, hydrogen). They need an operating model    
combining the strengths of an incumbent with the agility needed  
to succeed.

transition as the world continues to move toward 
cleaner energy. Electrification and renewables, in 
particular, show accelerated growth, with electric 
power and hydrogen expected to represent 32 
percent of the global energy mix by 2035 and 50 

percent by 2050 (Exhibit 1). It’s hardly surprising that 
energy incumbents are entering this new energy 
space. The potential 2030 market opportunity in 
new energy businesses is estimated at $3 trillion, 
with top energy majors expected to make an average 
investment of $35 billion between 2022 and 2030.7

The State of Energy Organizations 2024As many energy majors embark on their own new 
energy business ventures, an important question on 
their minds is whether they can strike the right balance 
between dependence and independence, harnessing 
the advantages of being an incumbent while enabling 
the agility of a start-up. 

With new energy businesses in their early days, 
there are no definitive answers to this question of 
independence or integration; different types of new 
businesses are seeing initial success with different 
operating models. However, there are key choices 
and considerations that can help incumbents avoid 
the most common pitfalls of business building. This 
article explores the different operating models 
chosen for new energy ventures by companies with an 
established incumbent business (for example, oil and 
gas and utilities). 

Why the right choice matters  

Leaders can underestimate the difficulty of starting 
a new venture within the boundaries of existing 
processes, systems, culture, and behaviors. New 
businesses often fail to scale. Only 16 percent of 

executives in Fortune 100 companies report that 
their corporate business builds have achieved 
blockbuster success after four years.8 The 
remainder were partially successful at best. 

Disruption was once considered the domain of start-
ups. Today, however, incumbents are actively using 
this strategy themselves to disrupt the industry. 
Incumbents are rightly asking how to strike the right 
balance between dependence and independence 
when it comes to their new energy business. 

The pressure to make the right choice is enormous, 
given its impact on operational performance. 

Clear prioritization and end-to-end accountability 
for business units and teams can drive an uplift of 
more than 30 percent in operational performance.  
Ensuring purpose and the ability to operate 
autonomously to get things done can increase 
employee engagement by 30 percentage points. And 
creating teams of doers and removing red tape can 
turn plans into action five to ten times faster than if 
the incorrect operating model has been chosen.9  

As many energy majors embark on their own new 
energy business ventures, an important question 
on their minds is whether they can strike the right 
balance between dependence and independence, 
harnessing the advantages of being an incumbent 
while enabling the agility of a start-up.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Weighing the options   

Corporate structures for new energy businesses range 
from full business separation to full integration within 
the core business, each with its own benefits and risks.   

Full separation

In a separation model, the new business can be set 
up as a separate entity (such as a subsidiary). As a 
subsidiary, the new business has its own legal and 
financial structure, leadership team, processes, and 
people model. In many cases, it is largely funded by 

the parent company but often attracts additional 
external funding and partners (see sidebar “Case 
study: Eni creates an independent renewables 
business—Plenitude” for an example of this approach).

An alternative approach is to form a partnership with 
an existing renewables venture. The incumbent often 
provides the brand, access to customers, capital, and 
seconds specific key capabilities into the venture while 
the renewables venture provides the lean governance, 
processes, and culture required to grow at pace (see 
sidebar “BP partnered up with a renewables venture” 
for the story of how BP formed a joint venture to 
accelerate their solar business).

Case study: Eni creates an independent renewables business—Plenitude 

In 2023, Eni, a leading energy company, 
decided to fully carve out their renewables 
business in order to diversify their portfolio 
and accelerate their growth. As part of 
this process, they combined their existing 
renewables generation business with their 
retail, energy management, finance, and 
environmental, social, and governance 
operations.¹ In doing so, a financially self-

sufficient company was created with an 
entirely independent operating model from 
the parent company, with some exceptions 
on risk management, compliance, and 
selected audit processes. The board of the 
new venture was made up of independent 
board members as well as several members 
selected from the parent company.

Creating the fully independent organization, 
Plenitude, allowed them to integrate the 
renewables value chain (from generation to 
consumers), better position this part of the 
business to attract green financing,  
and achieve a higher valuation for the    
combined entities.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024 
 
BP partnered up with a renewables venture

An example of a partnership approach 
is LightsourceBP. In 2017, BP initiated a 
collaboration with Lightsource Renewable 
Energy, investing $200 million for a 
43 percent stake.¹ Two years later, this 
collaboration became LightsourceBP, a 
50:50 joint venture. For BP, it offered 
a way to establish a start-up-minded 
renewables business with solar expertise. 
Conversely, Lightsource Renewable Energy 
gained credibility, capital, and process 
standardization through the BP association, 
leading to rapid growth in the pipeline from 

five markets and 1.5 gigawatts (GW) to 19 
markets and 55 GW in the pipeline in just  
five years.² 

LightsourceBP is being fully integrated into 
BP’s Gas and Low Carbon unit, after BP 
announced it was acquiring its outstanding 
50 percent stake, aiming to share the 
capabilities, experience, and learnings 
from their other technologies (for example,  
onshore wind).3

What can we learn from this? Opting for this 
level of independence for the new venture 

offers autonomy and decision making free 
from the processes in the parent company 
which are often designed for a different 
type of business. External talent can infuse 
an entrepreneurial mindset and drive rapid 
expansion. However, such independence 
potentially sacrifices benefits like access 
to the parent company’s customer base, 
stakeholder network, distribution channels, 
and assets. It also necessitates establishing 
its new processes, systems, and  
support functions.

Integration into the existing structure

Many incumbents choose to set up a new energy 
business within their existing structure, with varying 
degrees of independence. The level of independence 
may vary over time, driven by the maturity of the 
business, the type of technology, and perceived 
synergies with the core business (see sidebar “EDP 

Renewables goes through a journey with varying levels 
of integration over time” to read the story of how EDP 
evolved the level of integration of their renewables 
business over time). This is a choice we also see in 
Equinor and others where the business is kept closer 
to the core when incubated and, over time, given more 
independence as it matures.

EDP Renewables goes through a journey with varying levels of integration over time

EDP Renewables (EDPR), one of the largest 
renewables players in the world, has been 
through a journey in terms of its level    
of independence. 

EDPR’s origin story is closely tied to EDP’s 
strategic decision to expand into the 
renewable energy sector. In 2006, EDP 
created a dedicated division focused on 
renewable energy, which laid the foundation 
for what would become EDPR. This division 

was tasked with developing, building, and 
operating renewable energy projects, with a 
particular emphasis on wind power. 

Over the years, EDPR experienced 
significant growth and in 2008, EDPR 
completed its initial public offering (IPO), 
becoming a publicly traded company.¹ This 
move allowed it to access additional capital 
for its renewable energy projects and 
signaled its commitment to further growth 

and expansion. Over time EDP and EDPR’s 
story has remained closely intertwined. This 
is a story about creating a renewables unit 
flexible enough to grow in an environment 
closer to a start-up than the conventional 
business with the ability to raise external 
capital needed to do so. EDP always retained 
more than 70 percent ownership of their 
EDPR listed subsidiary and they continue to 
be core to EDP with a shared CEO and CFO.²

A more integrated new energy business, especially in 
the early phases, allows incumbents to provide their 
new ventures with advantages not available to an 
independent venture. These include customer access, 
brand recognition, negotiation leverage, stakeholder 
relations, existing base of suppliers, talent, intellectual 
property, distribution capabilities, as well as easier 
access to capital. 

There is still a spectrum in terms of the level of 
integration across five relevant dimensions: steering 
model, who sets targets, capital allocation process, 
talent approach, and operational processes (Exhibit 2). 

The first factor to consider is the steering model of 
the new business. In addition, incumbents need to 
decide what level of control the core business will have 
over the new energy business, and which part of the 
business sets the strategy and targets for the new 
venture. Capital allocation needs to be considered as 
does the talent approach. Where will the new energy 
venture source its talent and capabilities—from within 
the core business or from outside the core? And, 
lastly, what are the operational processes that the new 
venture will use, and specifically, which parts of the 
business are involved in project delivery?

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Organizations make different choices on each of these 
five dimensions when setting up their new energy 
business. However, for capital allocation, we do see 
a trend that the large majority chooses to allocate 
an envelope to the new business with stage gates to 
release funding. For their talent approach, many of the 
oil and gas majors start out using a very integrated HR 
process but over time move to more independence for 
the new businesses.

Integrating a new business into the core traditional 
business of an incumbent does not come without 
risks. It is important to make sure entrenched ways 
of working, relatively cumbersome processes 
(compared to those of a start-up), cultural norms, 
and mindsets do not hamper the success of the new 
venture. Incumbents must be mindful of the risks and 
purposefully mitigate those. 

Based on our experience, eight imperatives are 
starting to emerge that leaders could consider when 
starting a new business that is integrated within the 
existing business: 

1.  Avoid short-term earnings pressure. Start-ups 

often prioritize market share and scale over short-
term profits. If a parent company pressures its 
new businesses to meet return thresholds similar 
to the parent company’s, they are more likely to 
make decisions that limit long-term prospects.

2.  Provide rapid access to capital. Access to capital 

is fundamental for scaling. The operating model 
could facilitate securing the necessary funding 
for projects, whether through internal resources, 
external investments, or partnerships. Financial 
flexibility is key to seizing growth opportunities 
when they arise.

3.  Allow customization of core processes and 
project design. Streamlining operational 
processes is essential for cost-effectiveness and 
scalability in a low-margin industry (especially 
compared to major capital projects in oil and 

gas). Lean and efficient processes help manage 
project delivery, reduce overheads, and allocate 
resources effectively. In addition, designing 
projects with scalability in mind is essential. 
The new business could be set up to replicate 
successful project models in different markets, 
minimizing the need for reinventing the wheel.

4.  Create shortcuts for decision-making 

processes and avoid red tape. A parent 
company’s bureaucracy can limit the ability to 
make quick decisions. The new business could 
be allowed to make swift decisions without 
being bogged down by bureaucratic processes. 
A streamlined decision-making framework 
accelerates the response to market opportunities 
and challenges.

5.  Freedom in talent acquisition and retention. 

Attracting and retaining top talent is crucial. The 
setup could enable the new energy business to 
recruit skilled professionals who are passionate 
about the renewable energy sector. Offering 
competitive compensation, growth opportunities, 
and a compelling employee value proposition 
(EVP) is vital to building a talented workforce.

6.  Allow for partnerships and ecosystem 

integration. Building strategic partnerships 
within the new energy ecosystem can accelerate 
growth. Collaborating with other industry 
players, research institutions, and start-ups can 
provide access to complementary capabilities, 
technologies, and markets.

7.  Autonomy when setting up enabling services 
and platforms. Our research shows that 
successful business builders grant their new 
businesses considerable autonomy in core IT, 
marketing, data and analytics, and HR while 
making sure the new business stays aligned with 
the overall strategy of the company.10

10  2021 Global report: The state of new-business building, McKinsey, December 6, 2021.

15

The State of Energy Organizations 20248.  Entrepreneurial culture, aligned with the 

values of parent company. Ensure that the new 
business’s culture, while different, aligns with 
the mission and values of the parent company. A 
cohesive cultural framework fosters collaboration, 
knowledge sharing, and a sense of purpose.

By carefully considering these critical factors 
incumbents can position themselves for rapid growth 
and success in a competitive and evolving industry.

The first steps for incumbents    

Choosing an operating model for a new energy 
business isn’t a matter of right or wrong—it’s about 
being clear on the choices and consequences. Striking 
the balance between dependence and independence 
to harness both the strengths of incumbency and the 
agility of start-ups is a complex challenge. The next 
steps for established energy majors involve carefully 
weighing the options, understanding the spectrum 
of integration, and mitigating potential risks. 

To navigate this transformative journey successfully, 
leaders can consider various factors, including 
how much the new venture would benefit from 
customer access, brand recognition, negotiation 
leverage, stakeholder relations, existing base of 
suppliers, talent, intellectual property, distribution 
capabilities, as well as easier access to capital. 
They can also ask whether any of these benefits 

can be provided while balancing the need to create 
a lean, fast-growing organization with a different 
metabolic rate than the traditional business.

Once the corporate structure and level of 
independence versus integration have been 
chosen and the business has started, the 
next questions arise. How do you accelerate 
growth and scaling in terms of project pipeline, 
required workforce, and capability building? 

In terms of growing rapidly, new businesses can 
look at acquisitions as one potential avenue for 
accelerating growth. An acquisition not only provides  
access to physical assets and partnerships, it also 
offers access to a new talent pool when executed 
well. For example, new businesses were 25 percent 
more likely to significantly exceed expectations 
when they made two acquisitions early in the scaling 
process compared to businesses that made no 
acquisitions or that made three or more.11 The new 
venture may need an “acquisition playbook” to 
ensure successful integration and retention of talent 
and constant screening of acquisition targets.

For talent strategy, the new business could 
focus on improving its EVP scores to attract 
and retain talent. Leaders could consider their 
EVP right from the start by designing an action 
plan that gives them a talent advantage. 

11  2021 Global report: The state of new-business building, McKinsey, December 6, 2021.

16

The State of Energy Organizations 2024On the leadership front, leaders need to operate with 
substantially greater speed and entrepreneurialism 
when entering the new energy sector. They may 
need to develop innovative ways of collaborating, 
both within their organizations and in the emerging 
energy ecosystems. A major challenge is attracting 
and retaining talent in an environment where 
traditional energy companies are under intense 
negative public pressure. These leadership 
challenges will be more keenly felt in the more 
integrated operating model, where leaders have to 
be the bridge between the old and new worlds.

―

New energy businesses have the potential to thrive, 
and many incumbents are eager to enter this high-
growth space. The operating model that energy 
players choose can directly impact the success of their 
new business, and incumbents need to decide what 
strategy would best suit their business needs. This 
decision is only the beginning, but it can pave the way 
for future success.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Five features of 
operational excellence 
in oil and gas 
organizations 

New McKinsey analysis shows that while asset-centric models on 
average produce better results, function-centric models tend to 
perform more consistently.

By Robert Belanger, Christopher Handscomb, and Aïsha Lemsom.

18

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Operating models are emerging as a crucial 
performance differentiator as upstream oil and gas 
operators seek to improve the resiliency of their 
businesses amid energy transition uncertainty. 

To understand which types of operating models are 
delivering the highest near-term value from efficient 
operations, we evaluated the performance of different 
operating models across oil and gas organizations 
using our Energy Solutions operations benchmarking 
database. Analyzing the production and operation 
cost performance of more than 45 upstream 
business units—which operate more than 180 distinct 
assets—highlighted the trade-offs between the two 
approaches to managing assets: asset-centric and 
function-centric models.

In an asset-centric model, the asset teams are the 
“center of gravity.” All operational decisions are 
made by the asset or business unit leadership, and 
they are also accountable for profit and loss (P&L) 
results. Asset-centric models tend to embed technical 
and functional support within an asset team or  
business unit. 

In contrast, a function-centric model is where 
functional teams are responsible for the outcomes 
in their respective domains. Decisions within a 
function’s remit require the approval of the functional 
team, and in some instances, P&L accountability 
may be shared between functional and asset or 
business unit leadership. In this model, functions are 
often centralized into global teams that support the 
company’s entire asset base.

The results of this analysis indicate that while asset-
centric models tend to achieve better operational 

outcomes—measured as higher production efficiency 
and lower operating costs—they also experience a 
wide range of outcomes. The function-centric model 
tends to produce more consistent results, however, 
with lower operational performance.

Asset-centric models tend to 
outperform on outcomes 

On average, asset-centric models have the edge in 
terms of operational performance. Operating costs 
are generally 6 percent lower when normalized 
for asset scale and complexity and show two 
percentage points higher production efficiency 
than their function-centric counterparts (Exhibit 
3). This translates into tens of millions of dollars 
in cost savings and thousands of barrels a day of 
additional production. This outperformance means 
that the average function-centric business unit 
was on par with the third-quartile asset-centric 
business unit in terms of production efficiency. 

However, there is a trade-off between higher 
average performance and greater variability. Asset-
centric models have a wider range of outcomes 
on both operating cost and production efficiency 
than function-centric models. This occurs in both 
directions—the best outcomes for asset-centric 
models are better than the best outcomes that can 
be achieved when using function-centric models, but 
the opposite is also true. The worst outcomes when 
using an asset-centric model are far worse than the 
potentially bad outcomes of a function-centric model.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Enabling operational excellence: 
Five success factors

Function-centric models hold 
their own advantages 

Based on our extensive work with operators, 
our experience indicates that asset-centric 
operating models can far outperform function-
centric models because they streamline and boost 
performance through five crucial characteristics:

Simplicity. High-performance assets tend to 
have operating models underpinned by simplified 
processes and minimal reporting lines. 

Control. Functional and technical support is carefully 
controlled, with integrated teams embedded in 
the asset creating an empowered frontline. 

Expertise. Staffing is tailored to each asset’s needs, 
with the required expertise embedded into the asset 
team and expressly dedicated to that team. Asset 
team leadership tends to have extensive experience 
within a particular asset or region (often more than 
20 years) while function-centric leadership often 
rotates in and out of postings every few years.

Efficiency. Workforces are streamlined with limited 
layers between asset leadership and the frontline. 
They tend to have an optimally sized workforce, 
with high levels of visibility into the corporate 
function’s costs, which helps drive efficiency.

Accountability. High asset performance is 
incentivized for the whole team, KPIs cascade down 
to the frontline, and performance is reviewed regularly 
to ensure transparency. Asset-centric leadership 
bears a high degree of ownership for performance 
outcomes because there is no tangential functional 
leadership to deflect blame; they are ultimately 
responsible for the results of their specific units. 

However, function-centric models are not doomed 
to poor performance. In fact, they might have some 
distinct advantages that can support broader 
strategic goals. Function-centric operators 
typically have a deep talent pool of expertise 
they can pull from to take on extreme technical 
challenges, like establishing infrastructure in a 
new region, supporting large capacity expansion 
projects, or integrating different asset types in a 
merger or acquisition, as it can be optimized across 
assets and countries. An example of where this 
model would be very beneficial for these types of 
challenges is during major project procurement 
and rig sequencing. Because they tend to achieve 
more consistent results, this can be reassuring to 
investors and provide stability after market shocks. 

With some targeted changes, function-centric 
models could get the best of both worlds by adopting 
the winning principles exhibited by asset-centric 
operators. For example, function-centric operators 
can adopt transparency in functions to help drive 
efficiency, challenging costs and support levels to 
ensure the right level of technical and functional 
support per dollar spent. Functional operators can 
further streamline their operations by optimizing 
organizational reporting layers and emphasizing more 
time in the seat for asset and business unit managers. 

―

Evaluating the effectiveness of your operating model 
is a critical and often overlooked lever that operators 
can pull on to drive performance and cost efficiency. 
Identifying and implementing the right model can 
significantly improve performance, and our study 
indicates that asset-centricity may be the way forward 
for many oil and gas organizations.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024The productivity prize 
in oil and gas: Lessons 
from top performers

Workforce productivity varies significantly across upstream oil and 
gas companies. Understanding the productivity gap—and the three 
levers to close it—could boost company performance and resilience. 

By Robert Belanger and Christopher Handscomb

22

The State of Energy Organizations 2024In their efforts to improve margins, many upstream 
oil and gas players are turning their attention to 
workforce productivity. This focus on productivity may 
prove especially important given industry headwinds: 
a looming retirement wave, the sometimes negative 
perception of the traditional energy sector among 
younger generations, significant talent outflow from 
the industry, and increasing competition for talent and 
capital from new energy industries—all of which are 
likely to make it harder for oil and gas producers to 
maintain and improve their productivity. 

A recent study of workforce productivity in the 
upstream oil and gas industry, using McKinsey’s 
Energy Solutions Organization Benchmark, found 
a substantial productivity gap across operators.12 
Analysis of over 50 business units from more than 30 
oil and gas companies from the global dataset found 
that the most productive companies were 150 percent 
more productive than the average operator. This 
productivity gap is driven by all functions across the 
typical organization. Analysis of these top performers 
indicates there is significant room for improvement  
for much of the sector, representing a major  
“productivity prize.”

Analyzing the productivity gap 

The productivity gaps we observed between upstream 
oil and gas companies are substantial—a top quartile 
peer can deliver 150 percent of the output of the 
average organization with the same-sized workforce. 
Remarkably, this increase in productivity does not 
come at a cost in terms of operational performance—
top quartile peers on average have similar levels 
of production efficiency and safety performance, 
delivering these outcomes with lower operating cost.13 

Top quartile organizations are delivering 2.5 times 
the drilling activity, managing more complex 
reservoirs, operating twice the number of assets, 
and spending 20 percent less on maintenance 
costs. Top performers can also deliver the same 
output as an average peer with 40 percent fewer 
full-time equivalent (FTE) employees (Exhibit 4).

A top quartile peer can deliver 150 percent 
of the output of the average organization 
with the same-sized workforce.

The most productive operators can achieve the same outcomes as peers with a 
fraction of the organizational resources.

Measuring productivity 
in a targeted way 

One of the most important ways to assess 
organizational performance is to measure 
productivity and the potential to improve it.                                                 
At its core, and simplest means of expression, 
productivity is the output for a given input. 

Traditionally, workforce or labor productivity has 
been measured by labor input such as working 

hours and financial output, including revenue.14 
However, these measures typically mask many of 
the underlying reasons for high or low productivity, 
and do not consider the nuances of each individual 
organization or provide specific insights into which 
levers have the greatest productivity potential.

Measuring staffing intensity offers an alternative 
approach that assesses workforce size per unit 
of activity, or the number of FTE employees and 
contractors (input) per unit of activity (output)—an 
inverse of productivity. An advantage of this approach

provides a way to normalize for different activities 
conducted by different functions. The activity set 
for Finance and Accounting, for example, looks very 
different from the activity set for the Subsurface 
or Wells functions, and traditional methods of 
productivity measurement make it hard to compare 
across functions. It also provides a way to adjust 
for structural differences between companies 
for things like scale, portfolio composition, asset 
complexity, and growth plans. Different “activity 
drivers” are used to normalize each function’s size 
to provide a like-for-like comparison against peers. 
For example, reservoir complexity can be used as an 
activity driver for the Subsurface function, while an 
index of drilling activity could be used for the Wells 
function. This removes any differences in performance 
due to factors outside of productivity and ways of 
working, which helps managers understand their 
organization’s true productivity opportunities.

How operators improve 
their productivity 

There are many levers that organizations can pull on 
to drive productivity. These fall into the three main 
categories of people, processes, and structure. 

People levers include improving the culture to 
create a more collaborative work environment, 
reconsidering the size of the workforce, enhancing 
talent through skills building (for example, multiskilling 
offshore personnel), and acquiring talent from 
outside the company. McKinsey research shows 
that the best performers are 800 percent more 
productive than the average employee in highly 

complex roles, highlighting the potential that can be 
unlocked by focusing on people levers.15 However, 
people levers are often enabled or magnified 
by improvements to process and structure.

Process levers can be used to streamline workflows, 
improve the efficiency of decision making, or 
enhance technology systems to support more 
efficient processes (for example, deploying 
advanced analytics systems in maintenance 
processes to improve equipment reliability). 

Finally, structure levers include reconfiguring the 
“boxes and lines” of how the company is organized to 
better align to sources of value creation. For example, 
our research shows that an asset-centric axis of 
organization can yield better operational performance 
than a function-centric orientation (see article, “Five 
features of operational excellence in oil and gas 
organizations”). This includes rethinking the location 
footprint to provide better access to assets and 
talent or altering roles and responsibilities to align the 
highest performers with the biggest sources of value.

McKinsey’s oil and gas workforce productivity study 
found that the productivity prize applies across all 
functions, both technical and nontechnical, meaning 
there is no one functional culprit for low productivity 
(Exhibit 5). Rather, leading producers tend to apply 
multiple levers across multiple functions to drive 
holistic productivity improvements. Sometimes, 
a specific functional transformation is needed 
(such as a financial system digital transformation) 
in order to enable additional operating model 
changes to drive productivity improvements.

The upstream oil and gas productivity gap—and 
on the flipside, the potential productivity prize—
presents a significant opportunity for upstream oil 
and gas companies to improve their resiliency as 

they face pressure to provide affordable, reliable, 
secure, and cleaner energy. A holistic approach that 
encompasses people, processes, and structure could 
help under-pressure oil and gas producers achieve the 
productivity levels of their top-performing peers.

Talent squeeze: 
Planning for the energy 
sector’s talent transition

Amid increased demand, an aging workforce, and decreased 
recruitment levels, the energy sector’s talent pool is under pressure. 
Five strategies can help executives fill their talent pipeline.

By Ignacio Fantaguzzi, Christopher Handscomb, Iyad Sheikh, and Aly Torres

27

The State of Energy Organizations 2024As the energy transition gathers pace, there is an 
increasing need for energy talent. The global demand 
for oil and gas is projected to remain roughly stable, 
while indicators point to substantial growth in supply 
from new energy sources by 2035.16 The energy 
industry is therefore facing two significant and 
interacting areas of talent demand: securing talent 
to build and run fast-growing new energy businesses 
and maintaining core talent for traditional oil and  
gas production. 

While demand for energy talent is growing, the energy 
sector is expecting to lose a substantial portion of 
its existing workforce; in the United States alone, 
as many as 400,000 employees in the sector are 
approaching retirement, expected to retire in the next 
10 years.17 Given the oil and gas industry’s negative 
perception among younger workers, traditional energy 
businesses may find themselves at the short end of an 
upcoming talent squeeze. 

Transferable competencies can 
help meet talent demand

Demand for talent from new energy businesses is 
likely to increase rapidly over the coming decade.18 
The good news for renewable energy employers 
is that knowledge, expertise, and competencies 

gained in oil and gas are relatively easy to transfer 
to green energy businesses including carbon 
capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen, and wind. 

CCS has the greatest transferability of both 
knowledge and experience, which is unsurprising 
given that many oil and gas companies have been 
capturing and storing carbon for some time. 
Hydrogen has fairly high transferability for most 
knowledge areas, though challenges remain 
regarding experience, especially in business 
development, commercial roles, and supply 
chain partnering. Offshore wind has the lowest 
relative transferability of these three, though 
it still offers ample opportunity for upstream 
employees to move into the new energy space.19 

McKinsey’s Organization Data Platform analyzed 
publicly available data from LinkedIn to explore the 
talent circumstances of new energy businesses 
globally. They found that employees in the hydrogen 
space hold similar degree subjects to the degrees of 
those in traditional exploration and production (E&P) 
(Exhibit 6). This overlap underscores the high level of 
knowledge transferability between roles and indicates 
that there may be growing competition for talent 
between traditional and new energy businesses. 

The good news for renewable energy employers 
is that knowledge, expertise, and competencies 
gained in oil and gas are relatively easy to 
transfer to green energy businesses.

There is high overlap in degree subject between traditional upstream and 
hydrogen talent.

McKinsey also looked at the tenure of those in 
hydrogen-related roles and found that nearly four-
fifths of employees have worked in the space for less 
than five years and only 10 percent of the total talent 
pool have more than ten years of hydrogen-related 

experience.20 This means that hydrogen businesses 
could struggle to find experienced people to fill 
positions and will need to establish programs to 
rapidly build expertise.

continue to need talent

from new energy businesses, and workforce 
demographics that point to a looming talent crunch.  

Meanwhile, demand for talent from traditional oil and 
gas companies is not going away. Globally, McKinsey 
expects to see broadly consistent demand for workers 
through to at least 2035.21 Meeting this demand 
could be challenging amid growing competition 

In the United States, over a quarter of employees 
are at or near retirement age, many of whom are 
frontline workers (Exhibit 7). In the United Kingdom, 
demographics are similar, with 43 percent of 
offshore workers currently over the age of 45.22

cliff, it does emphasize the importance of maintaining 
a healthy recruitment pipeline into traditional oil and 
gas businesses over the coming decade. Energy 
companies will also need to reckon with—and develop 
plans to address—the impending loss of a valuable 
source of technical skills, industry knowledge, and 
institutional expertise. Thinking creatively about how 
to manage this aspect of the talent transition now 
could spur innovation, alternative work approaches, 
and an entry of fresh talent into the sector.23 

Competition for employees is also heating up. Since 
2016, out of all the employees who left their roles in 
energy and materials companies, 42 percent moved 
to a different industry.24 This underlines the very 
competitive nature of attracting and retaining talent 
within the sector.

Companies that lack a clear talent strategy could 
face a talent shortage in the years to come. As one 
upstream executive put it, “The average age of our rig 
workers is 58 years old. We expect them to retire in ten 
years, but the life of our asset is 20 years. We currently 
don’t have a fact-based view on how big the problem is 
or how we are addressing it in the future.”

Hiring talent to backfill critical roles and fill new 
roles presents a unique set of obstacles in the 
energy sector. Experienced workers are retiring, 

mid-tenure employees have new opportunities in 
adjacent industries, and data indicates that fewer 
new employees are entering this workforce. The 
percentage of employees with less than two years of 
tenure dropped from 16 percent in 2012 to less than 4 
percent in 2022.

An improved value proposition 
could attract fresh talent

Another challenge is that the oil and gas sector 
may not be perceived as attractive by potential 
employees. Research shows that a compelling 
employee value proposition (EVP) is strongly 
correlated with lower attrition rates and that this 
is an important and influential notion for younger 
generations (see article Employee retention trends 
and challenges in the oil and gas industry).

To understand the impact of EVP in the traditional 
upstream sector, McKinsey examined employee 
satisfaction across industries on a range of 
dimensions. While oil and gas still scores above 
average for compensation, it is towards the bottom 
of the pack for career opportunities, corporate 
culture, and perceptions of senior management. In 
short, oil and gas companies tend to score lower on 
their EVP relative to other industries (Exhibit 8). 

Since 2016, out of all the employees who left 
their roles in energy and materials companies, 
42 percent moved to a different industry.

Oil and gas lags many peer industries in several key dimensions of their value proposition to employees.McKinsey & CompanyThe State of Energy Organizations 2024However, employees perceive oil and gas companies 
differently across regions, and EVP scores differ 
significantly (see sidebar, “Employee value 
proposition”). Oil and gas employee satisfaction is 
generally lower in developed markets, whereas jobs in 
oil and gas are still seen as one of the most desirable 
placements for top talent in many parts of the world. 
These regional differences may play an increasingly 
important role in talent decisions for global operators 
in the years ahead.

When rating their employers in terms of work–life 
balance, European employees reported the highest 

satisfaction (3.8 on a scale of one to five). On the other 
end, employees from Northern Africa, North America, 
the Middle East, and the Pacific Islands rated their 
work–life balance lowest, at 3.5, respectively. On 
average, Central Asian and Russian employees ranked 
their employers highest in terms of culture (4.1), career 
opportunities (3.8), and senior management (3.7), 
while North American employees expressed lower 
ratings across all categories except compensation, 
where Caribbean and Latin American employers 
ranked highest at 3.9.²⁵ 

Employee value proposition

An EVP defines the unique promise made to employees regarding experiences and benefits that they can expect to 
receive from a company. Effective value propositions typically encompass four components: the company’s purpose, 
values, and culture; its leadership, which includes the employee relationship with managers; the employee’s role 
(including developmental opportunities); as well as their rewards, including intangible benefits, such as the ability to be 
home every night at a consistent hour. 

Charting a course through 
the talent transition

Executives in traditional oil and gas businesses may 
need to think about driving talent transformation 
to underpin long-term success.²⁶ To do this, senior 
leaders could focus on the following five areas and 
address the associated underlying questions:

1. Building strategic talent plans. A successful talent 
strategy most often hinges on facts rather than 
intuition when it comes to understanding future 
talent needs and is anchored in the company’s 
strategic and business goals. Talent plans can be 
built up from project-level talent needs to inform 
an integrated skill-based talent view. Executives 
could consider: which roles are likely to be 
impacted by retirement in the next six months, 

25  McKinsey analysis. 

26  “Agile transformation in heavy industries: An interview with SOCAR Türkiye,” McKinsey, March 21, 2023.

33

The State of Energy Organizations 2024one year, three years, and five years? What are 
the critical capabilities needed? What are the 
underlying drivers of attrition? Where are the 
existing hidden pockets of talent with required 
skill sets? Do we want to take an incremental 
approach to manage our talent transition, or 
do we need to drastically correct course?

          For example, one leading aerospace and defence 
company derisked a $100 million program by 
focusing on trades talent and attrition and 
responded with a clear talent strategy, EVP, 
and improved use of advanced analytics. It was 
able to reach an equilibrium between talent 
demand and supply to meet its strategic plans. 

2. Renewing efforts to transform the employee 

value proposition. Driven by data, the best 
efforts aim to achieve specific outcomes. An 
example of this is retaining more senior talent in 
the industry by changing the work environment. 
Another is delaying retirement or creating flexible 
career paths to allow graduate hires to work 
across traditional oil and gas companies and new 
energy businesses within the same company. 
Executives can ask: what do our employees 
really value? What are the risks? How are we 
measuring success? How will we act faster, more 
nimbly, or under different resource constraints?

       A leading energy company established a talent 
“war room” to bring together resources from 
across the organization (including programs, 
human resources, data science, analytics, 
and IT) to create a faster, more agile, and more 
streamlined talent management and EVP 

evolution process. It was able to address short- 
and medium-term talent challenges head on. 

3. Modernizing ways of working to meet rising 
employee expectations and increase 
productivity. There has been continued uptake 
of agile teaming and increasing sophistication 
when devising flexible working policies. Leaders 
could ask themselves how to make priorities 
clear from top to bottom in the organization? 
Where could we release value between 
functional silos through agile teams? What 
workplace and hybrid working policies best 
balance employee satisfaction and productivity? 
For example, several energy companies 
are organizing for agility at scale to improve 
results, speed, and employee experience.²⁷ 

4. Taking advantage of global talent markets by 

revisiting technical hub strategies. This is 
relevant for both traditional and new businesses. 
Companies are thinking hard about which 
activities need to be done “close to the assets” 
and which could be undertaken in other regions 
to access the world’s largest engineering talent 
pools. Questions include: how do we evolve 
our global mobility programs? What type of 
talent is critical to have close to the work—for 
example, frontline talent—and what can be 
sourced elsewhere—for example, talent from 
the same regions? How can we adopt a more 
global perspective for difficult-to-fill technical 
roles? And how do we leverage talent from 
other countries with renowned engineering or 
technical programs and educational institutions?

27  McKinsey analysis.

34

The State of Energy Organizations 2024          Several oil and gas companies are reshaping 

their technical functions, such as engineering, 
to build and grow hubs in other regions. 
Such moves provide access to large, high-
quality technical talent pools and create 
stronger central support models. 

5. Exploring tech such as generative AI to improve 
productivity and augment capabilities. 
Recently, many companies have developed 
proof of concepts for generative AI (gen 
AI) that can allow employees to spend time 
doing higher-value tasks. Companies could 
ask themselves: how could gen AI tools help 

with knowledge and experience transfer 
between generations? What opportunities 
exist to use digital tools to accelerate training 
for technical and operational hires? 

―

This is an unprecedented time for the energy industry 
as it transitions into the net-zero world. Like many 
other industries, the talent that oil and gas companies 
can attract, develop, and retain will shape the 
companies of tomorrow. The key question isn’t so 
much “How do I get enough talent to deliver on my 
plans?” but rather, “How can we confidently use this 
transition to our advantage?”

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Employee retention 
trends and challenges 
in the oil and gas 
industry 

Oil and gas companies are struggling to retain top talent. Focusing 
on EVP can improve retention but levers to boost EVP differ widely 
across the industry. 

By Robert Belanger, Giulio Carbone, and Ignacio Fantaguzzi 

36

The State of Energy Organizations 2024In our conversations with oil and gas executives, 
discussions around talent are converging on a 
theme: companies are finding it increasingly difficult 
to attract and retain employees, especially since 
skill requirements are changing dramatically in the 
decarbonization era.²⁸ Building a distinctive employee 
value proposition (EVP)—which is a set of benefits 
that an employee gets for what they give, including 
aspects like compensation and benefits, career 
opportunities, work–life balance, company culture, 
and management—could prove pivotal to attracting 
and retaining the best talent as compensation for 
workers heats up. 

Analyzing more than 70 major organizations across 
different parts of the oil and gas value chain, we 
found a direct correlation between a company’s EVP 
score and tenure rates: when a higher EVP score is 
observed, employees generally remain at the company 

for longer. While our research suggests that retention 
dynamics vary strongly across industry subsectors, 
leadership style, more than compensation, is generally 
key to driving a distinctive EVP.

EVP scores vary widely 
across the industry 

With the support of the McKinsey People Analytics 
experts, who collected publicly available information 
from LinkedIn and Glassdoor, we analyzed the EVP 
ratings of more than 70 organizations and their 
corresponding attrition rates and found a clear 
link between low EVP scores and higher levels of 
attrition. We broke down the findings to understand 
how these trends are playing out across the different 
types of major oil and gas companies (Exhibit 9). 

Leadership style, more than compensation, is 
generally key to driving a distinctive EVP.

28  For more information on these trends, see: “Renewable-energy development in a net-zero world: Overcoming talent gaps,” McKinsey,  

November 4, 2022.

Outside-in data of key oil and gas players suggests a link between EVP  
and attrition.

The data shows that EVP and retention dynamics are 
specific to the different subindustry segments, and 
therefore require different “calls to action.”

create a more distinctive EVP to better differentiate 
themselves from peers and attract the best talent in 
the sector.

Majors—large global oil and gas companies operating 
in different parts of the value chain—are closely 
aligned in a “midrange” position with a limited degree 
of differentiation in terms of EVP and attrition rate. 
Most big corporations have an EVP score of between 
3.3 and 4.1 (out of a 5-point scale) and corresponding 
attrition rates of 9 to 11 percent. Majors could 

National oil companies (NOCs) have the strongest 
position across oil and gas, both in terms of EVP and 
low attrition, as they are often the leading employers 
in their country’s energy sector and face less national 
competition for talent. It is important for NOCs to 
build a well-rounded EVP, leveraging distinctive 
compensation, benefits, and broader organizational

health to attract unique capabilities and young talent, 
not only within national boundaries but also  
from abroad.

Upstream companies are seeing the highest levels 
of attrition in the industry, despite their EVP scores 
tending to be in line with the sector average. This 
might be related to the high demand for specific 
technical skills, which are difficult to develop internally 
and are instead acquired through the job market via 
competitive offers or outsourced. Other factors may 
include workers leaving the traditional oil and gas 
industry for new energy companies, or market volatility 
as the energy transition accelerates.

There are, however, a few outliers that are challenged 
by high attrition. The outliers in the downstream 
subsector may need to quickly align themselves with 
the standards set by their market peers.

Services and equipment companies tend to have 
below-average EVPs and high levels of attrition. Talent 
in services and equipment companies is generally 
in demand outside of the oil and gas industry, and 
companies may need to act quickly on their EVP to 
address high attrition rates. As a first step, service 
and equipment organizations can investigate the root 
causes of their high attrition and develop context-
specific strategies for better talent retention.  

Since the high attrition rate is partially structural in 
this subindustry, upstream companies could focus 
on reliable and fast recruitment processes to ensure 
continued insourcing of required talent.

Midstream companies are closely aligned with low 
attrition overall and an average EVP. Like majors, 
midstream companies could create a more distinctive 
EVP to differentiate themselves as an employer  
of choice.

Downstream companies are closely aligned with 
a low attrition rate overall and above-average EVP. 

Leadership style is key 
to driving EVP 

We also analyzed the different drivers of EVP across 
five categories: work–life balance, culture, career 
opportunities, compensation and benefits, and 
leadership style (Exhibit 10). While differences are not 
high, on average, we found that companies in oil and 
gas across subsectors score the lowest in leadership 
style and the highest in compensation and benefits. 

39

The State of Energy Organizations 2024 
Exhibit 10

The major gap for employee value proposition is not compensation  
but management.

These findings have practical implications for how oil 
and gas companies across different parts of the value 
chain can strengthen their EVP. Regarding leadership 
style, it is important for the CEO and other leaders 
to be recognizable and charismatic role models, not 
only within the company but also toward the external 
stakeholders. We have observed that a new leadership 
style is emerging in the industry around five shifts 
that change how leaders—and companies’ EVPs— 
are perceived.²⁹

•  Setting focus and direction: from executive to 
visionary. When defining the direction of their 
company, it is important for executives to not only 

ensure that profits are predictably delivered to 
shareholders but also that they take a visionary 
stance—engaging employees with a compelling 
purpose to deliver impact and value to all external 
stakeholders and society.

•  Designing how value is created: from planner 
to architect. Rather than taking a traditional, 
planner-oriented view focused on capturing a 
greater share of the existing value from their 
competitors, leaders can adopt an architect 
mindset by working with customers and other 
external stakeholders to reimagine and disrupt 
industry norms to generate new value.

•  Organizing how people work together: from 

director to catalyst. Traditionally, leaders took 
a director’s approach to developing defined 
organizational structures, with clear roles, 
responsibilities, and authorities. A catalyst 
approach, by contrast, allows leaders to 
encourage transparency, collaboration, and 
inclusiveness across the organization and 
externally, guiding empowered teams and cross-
unit networks with external stakeholders. 

•  Getting work done: from controller to coach. 

Leaders can combine the traditional, controller 
leadership style with the coach style. In this 
way, they will operate through detailed analysis 
and precise planning to deliver outcomes and 
minimize variances, while also focusing on a more 
innovative coaching view, operating through 
short cycles of rapid decision making and 
experimentation while learning to respond to  
new challenges and opportunities in the    
external environment.  

•  Showing up as a leader: from expectation-setter 
to authentic leader. Blending the traditional 
expectation-setter approach of setting clear 
professional expectations for subordinates 
with the emerging style of “authentic leader” 
can encourage openness, personal well-being, 
creativity, and autonomy.  

By embracing emerging leadership qualities, industry 
leaders could tailor a unique and powerful leadership 
style to improve their EVP, attract the right talent, and 
reduce attrition. 

A step-by-step approach to 
strengthening EVP: A case study 

The European subsidiary of an oil and gas giant 
found itself facing a shortage of the right talent 
to address its strategic goals of decarbonization 
and digitalization. While the company was highly 
regarded by tenured oil and gas professionals, it 
was falling short in attracting the new engineering 
and digital talents required, especially women.

The CEO understood the gravity of the challenge 
and closely partnered with the chief human 
resources offices (CHRO) and the rest of 
the leadership team to attract and retain the 
right talent through a phased approach:

Aspire. The leadership team worked together to 
translate the business strategy into a compelling 
vision for the future, centered on decarbonization 
and digitalization, to ignite purpose and passion 
in current employees and future candidates. 

Assess. A rigorous approach was followed to listen to 
the “voice of employees” through employee surveys 
(such as our Organizational Health Index), interviews, 
and focus groups. This was complemented with an 
external diagnostic (using publicly available data from 
LinkedIn and Glassdoor) to identify the current EVP 
perception and key opportunities for improvement. 
The results highlighted that employees were looking 
for more emphasis on inclusion and diversity, 
flexible working hours to cater to family needs, and 
a compelling purpose focused on decarbonization.

41

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Architect. Leveraging the insights from the 
diagnostics, the CHRO, with guidance from other 
leaders, shaped a cultural and organizational 
action plan to address the identified areas for 
improvement. The company created a compelling 
EVP with career paths for the specific talent pools 
required, a new diversity and inclusion strategy, 
and gender quota objectives, and collaborated 
with leading universities in Europe to improve 
their employer brand among students. 

Act. The defined plan was actioned collaboratively at 
all levels of the organization. The company mobilized 
employees to identify change ambassadors to 
drive change in the different units and geographies. 
For this activity, data-driven insights from social 
network analyses helped the company identify key 
actors to catalyze change within the organization. 
At the same time, top executives embraced the 
new leadership style in line with the five shifts, 
shaping a different culture and ways of working. 

After almost two years since the launch of the 
project, the company achieved a leading position 
for EVP—within the top-quartile of industry peers—
and a CEO rating of over 80 percent. The company 
is now considered a best-in-class workplace for 
women to build a career in the oil and gas industry. 

―

Oil and gas companies may need to think beyond 
compensation and create a positive working 
environment if they want to attract and retain talent—
especially as they face increasing competition from 
new energy industries requiring competencies that are 
easily transferable from the oil and gas industry.

By improving leadership styles and company 
dynamics—and therefore EVP scores—employees 
may want to stay with their company longer, allowing 
institutional knowledge to grow within the workforce, 
and ensuring fewer resources are spent on hiring  
and onboarding.

Powering up new 
leadership for a 
changing energy 
environment 

Realizing it can no longer be ‘business as usual,’ industry chiefs need 
to transform themselves and their organizations to succeed. 

By Anton Derkach, Ignacio Fantaguzzi, Neil Pearse, and Micah Smith
Published on McKinsey.com, February 3, 2023.

43

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Technological, economic, regulatory, and geopolitical 
forces are driving a rapid evolution of the global 
energy landscape. Although opinions vary on the 
pace and extent of the resulting transitions, attempts 
to balance energy security, affordability, and long-
term decarbonization ambitions are contributing to 
unprecedented uncertainty about the global    
energy future.

While transformation of the global energy mix is not 
new, the current transition is larger in scale and more 
complex than previous ones due to the multitude and 
sometimes divergent drivers of the transition. As one 
industry CEO summed it up: “The energy industry 
has basically been static for a long time, although we 
did not know it was static. We’ve now moved from a 
largely internal, incremental agenda, to a whole set of 
existential risks and opportunities in front of us.”

On one hand, the increasing urgency around climate 
change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is 
driving the transition to cleaner energy sources.30  
Many countries and corporations have committed 
to achieving net-zero emissions within the next few 
decades. Early movers—industry incumbents and 
pure-play, clean-energy players—are leading the 
paradigm shift, disrupting traditional business models 
and making permanent structural changes to   
these industries.

On the other hand, the rebound in energy demand 
after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
coupled with supply-side constraints over the past 
year, have revealed the magnitude of the challenge 
in achieving climate change ambitions. Global energy 
demand and supply-side variability are expected 
to increase over the next decade. Until alternative 
energy sources are universally efficient, scalable, and 
affordable, traditional energy sources and related 
infrastructure will continue to play an essential role.

These considerations introduce a high degree 
of uncertainty about the path ahead, including 
how energy supply and demand, competitive and 
geopolitical dynamics, and societal implications will 
evolve. One thing is clear, however: the search for 
sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy will be at 
the core of global aspirations.

Five ways leaders can transform to 
succeed in this shifting landscape

These unprecedented and evolving challenges need 
to be tackled by all leaders of companies in the energy 
sector, from pure-play, new-energy start-ups to more 
traditional oil and gas companies balancing old and 
new business models, risk profiles, and cultures.

Many of the elements of what it takes to succeed 
in the evolving energy environment will likely differ 
from those experienced in the past. Fresh demands 
may be placed on leaders, and a fundamentally new 
approach to leadership will likely be required for 
incumbents and start-ups. This is irrespective of the 
business strategy adopted—which may range from 
a full pivot to clean energy, to a combination play, to 
an ongoing focus on a core hydrocarbon business 
but with the introduction of emissions abatement.

Overall, we see companies—and leaders—needing 
to operate with substantially greater speed and 
entrepreneurialism, and this is especially applicable in 
the new energy sector. They may need to develop and 
practice fresh ways of collaborating, both within their 
organizations and in the emerging energy ecosystems. 
A major challenge is attracting and retaining talent in 
an environment where traditional energy companies 
are under intense negative public pressures.

organizations in the energy sector to gain their 
perspectives on the critical leadership capabilities 
required to succeed in this new energy era.31 The 
interviews were complemented by a global survey of 
more than 140 senior industry leaders. The survey 
asked leaders to identify and rate the importance 
of different leadership capabilities against the 
backdrop of the current macroenvironment, and 
to offer their perception on how leaders in their 
organizations are currently performing across 

these capabilities. Finally, we layered in data from 
our extensive body of leadership research and 
decades of experience helping organizations 
with their leadership transformations.

Based on our experience and research, we defined 
five key roles that leaders typically perform, from 
setting focus and direction to showing up as a 
leader, and identified two broad categories of 
leadership qualities and mindsets, which we have 
called “traditional” and “emerging” (Exhibit 11).

from respondents on the importance of emerging 
leadership qualities and mindsets to succeed in the 
new energy environment, while reiterating the ongoing 
relevance of traditional qualities (Exhibit 12). 

We observed a larger gap between desired and 
current levels of competency for emerging leadership 
qualities and mindsets. This is unsurprising, as 
successful leaders and executives have practiced and 
honed the traditional qualities for many years.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024A closer look at the data suggests that some 
traditional leadership qualities are more important 
than others. For example, being an effective executive 
delivering financial returns for shareholders continues 
to be a prerequisite, and detailed planning and 
working toward defined delivery is still important.

In terms of emerging qualities, numerous respondents 
highlighted the importance of meeting stakeholder 
expectations, with growing pressure on energy 
firms beyond creating value for their shareholders. 
Furthermore, there is clear recognition of the need for 
new leadership approaches to operate through shorter 
decision cycles and with greater experimentation, 
and to take advantage of market fluctuations and 
emerging and uncertain new-energy opportunities.

Shifting one’s mindset and embracing emerging 
leadership qualities can be a challenge for senior 
leaders who have relied on traditional tool kits. 
However, there is also a great opportunity here. 
During our research, many sector leaders expressed 
excitement about building and leading new kinds of 
organizations, and designing them to succeed today 
and in the future. There was also much enthusiasm 
about the prospect of exhibiting greater purpose, 
promoting employee empowerment, facilitating 
collaboration inside and outside their organizations, 
and operating with higher levels of agility  
and entrepreneurialism.

What does this leadership transformation require? We 
see it as including five key unlocks, involving mindset 
and behavioral shifts (Exhibit 13).

1. Setting focus and direction: 
Beyond profit to impact

attract and retain talent and ensures these individuals 
thrive. Investors understand why this is valuable, 
and factor purpose into their decision making.

The purpose of any organization is to create value 
for its stakeholders. In today’s open environment, 
where people have more information and options 
than before, leaders are well-placed to deeply 
understand how their organizations will add 
unique value to customers, colleagues, investors, 
partners, and other key stakeholders. While 
generating financial returns for shareholders 
remains critical, the purpose of an organization now 
extends to the role it plays in benefiting society.

The energy sector is becoming keenly aware of this 
need to widen the scope of value-add. The CEO of a 
downstream company emphasized what this means 
for leadership: “In the past, the oil and gas industry 
has been made up of engineers and accountants. In 
today’s world, we need to include communicators in 
our leadership to help us find an emotional attachment 
to what we do. Their involvement will help demonstrate 
how using practical solutions to do things more 
sustainably can be exciting and inspiring.” The CEO 
of a European private energy company echoed this 
sentiment, saying: “There is a huge opportunity 
ahead to have unbelievable impact. It’s the kind of 
opportunity that only arises once in a generation. We 
can change our country, we can change our region, 
we can contribute to global change. Realizing this 
opportunity will be monumental, and stepping away 
is unthinkable. This is what is inspiring us now.”

Top-performing organizations know that purpose 
is both a differentiating factor and a must-have. 
A strongly held sense of corporate purpose is a 
company’s unique affirmation of its identity and 
embodies what the organization stands for, from a 
historical, emotional, social, and practical point of view. 
Future-ready companies recognize that purpose helps 

Crafting a compelling, purposeful narrative is 
particularly important for companies navigating the 
energy transition. Leaders may look to build new, 
lower-carbon businesses while generating most of 
the cash flow and profits from the traditional core. 
A balance may then need to be struck between the 
past and the future in a way that is coherent and 
inspiring for employees in all parts of the business. 
On maintaining this balance, one executive reflected: 
“We originally got this wrong and over-indexed on the 
newer businesses when describing our purpose. This 
led to many in the traditional heart of our company 
questioning their role and even reconsidering their 
future with us. We quickly had to rebalance and 
find a more sophisticated narrative: celebrating 
our role in supplying secure and reliable energy to 
the world, while leading the charge to make sure 
this was ever cleaner through decarbonization 
and building new-energy businesses.”

Nonetheless, few companies harness purpose 
fully. In a McKinsey survey of employees at US 
companies, 82 percent said organizational purpose 
is important, but only half that number said their 
purpose drives impact. Leaders may wish to spend 
time thinking about, articulating, and championing 
their company’s purpose as it relates to the real 
impact of day-to-day business practices. One 
CEO put it this way: “We need to transform and 
unite our leadership. Leadership transformation 
will help us position our company and its culture 
to meet the new challenges. A united leadership 
is important to give our people and stakeholders 
a consistent message about the kind of place we 
want our company to be.” This emphasizes the 
importance of an inspiring company identity beyond 
the attachment to functions and business units.

48

The State of Energy Organizations 20242. Redesigning value creation: 
Beyond rivalry to camaraderie 

Leaders seeking to succeed in the new energy 
environment may look at moving beyond a win–win, 
“fixed mindset” approach, where the dominant 
focus is on protecting market share and beating 
competitors in existing businesses. Instead, they 
could make greater strides by adopting a win–win, 
“growth mindset” approach, by shifting focus to 
new value opportunities—working with suppliers, 
customers, and other stakeholders to introduce 
new technologies and solutions that will lead to new 
products, services, and businesses—and creating 
major new markets that do not exist today.

Such a shift in focus may require changes to capital 
allocation, operations, and performance management. 
Moreover, some changes may be contingent on 
actions by other entities. For example, mass uptake of 
electric vehicles depends on utilities expanding grid 
capacity to support charging networks. Companies 
may find they need to partner with other organizations 
to meet common needs, such as the necessity for 
industrial-scale networks in hydrogen production 
and distribution. Leaders may have to engage and 
work with a wide range of external partners and 
stakeholders to enhance and evolve the ecosystem 
within which the organization operates, exploring and 
generating mutually beneficial opportunities. They 
could benefit from developing connected thinking: 
joining traditionally separate sectors; fostering 
new links between companies, organizations, 
and citizens; and taking calculated risks.32

An executive in an energy service company 
emphasized the profound challenges they face, 
and the need for new and often uncomfortable 
thinking and action: “We are moving away from stable 
businesses that we are familiar with to ones we don’t 
understand. This is uncomfortable. In ten years, we 
will look back and say we did not take enough risks.” 
Another executive said: “We instinctively play defense 
instead of offense, because we believe we have so 
much to lose. I don’t have a fear of losing, but I do have 
a fear of not showing up for the game. We need to take 
more swings, which will then help us get more hits.”

While leaders may be required to take risks and try 
new approaches, they are well-placed to do this 
while being conscious of the resources used and with 
capital discipline. In most organizations, the “old” is 
subsidizing the “new,” which needs to be managed. 
One CEO from our research stressed the challenges 
of managing this duality: “Both the old and the new 
need to be included in the energy transition. There 
is nothing sustainable about not making money.” 
He also said he needs to be increasingly clinical 
about “stopping some projects that don’t work” to 
create space for those that show more potential.

Further, there is the need for new forms of ownership 
and governance. In this context, one CEO commented: 
“It is very easy to lose investors if you say, ‘Don’t worry, 
we will lose money on this for the next ten years.’ But 
to succeed now, you need to find the oxygen and 
the space to develop the new and the uncertain.”

49

The State of Energy Organizations 20243. Organizing how people work: 
Beyond command to collaboration

To survive and thrive, energy organizations and 
their leaders are well-placed to engage with their 
teams in ways that make them feel connected. Social 
capital—the presence of networks, relationships, 
shared norms, and trust among individuals, teams, and 
business leaders—is increasingly the glue that holds 
organizations together.33 When teams feel connected, 
they tend to get more work done and do it faster. When 
colleagues trust their managers and one another, they 
are more engaged, more willing to go beyond minimum 
work requirements, and more likely to stick around.

Social capital matters to an organization’s 
performance. By leaving frontline employees on the 
sidelines, companies miss out on critical information 
that could bring key strategic insights. An executive 
at a private oil and gas company noted how they are 
attempting to tap into their employee base: “Disruptive 
trends may start at the margins of an organization, 
where frontline employees operate. These employees’ 
perspectives and ideas often do not get clearly 
communicated to leadership, making it easy to 
brush them off, thinking they are not important.”

Leaders could engage and unleash the full potential 
of everyone in the organization by empowering 
people in small units (cross-network teams) instead 
of managing individuals through the narrow lens 
of rigid job descriptions. Small units might then be 
focused on a clear and distinct value-contribution 
mission, giving them the autonomy, access to 
information, guidance, training, and multidisciplinary 
capabilities they need to operate with high levels 
of entrepreneurship to successfully deliver on their 
goals. One oil and gas executive described this 
evolved leadership as “turning the whole pyramid 

leadership structure on its head. The people doing 
the work are key, and everyone else supports 
them. Servant leadership, role-modeling, and 
listening to the people who understand how the 
work gets done are all part of this new approach.”

Leading this empowered network requires high-
performing leaders who offer effective and 
efficient leadership, beyond the management 
of internal politics inherent in a hierarchy of 
individual managers and traditional governance 
groups. It requires fundamental shifts in the 
mission, culture, and operating models of every 
leader and leadership team in the network.

This new leadership style is often challenging. 
One head of production at an international energy 
company said: “My biggest change was giving up 
control and delegating. It wasn’t easy, but that’s 
exactly the change that was needed. Instead of 
asking teams for updates and reports, leaders 
now focus on giving context, setting the mission, 
and defining the purpose and intent. Leaders ask, 
‘How can I help?’ when engaging with teams, and 
focus on tackling problems. Teams are empowered 
to figure out how to deliver the mission within the 
boundaries defined by standard processes.”

To amplify and realize the full potential of everyone 
in the system, leaders could foster peer-to-peer 
transparency, relationships, and workflow across 
the various “small units.” This can be done by 
removing roadblocks that prevent empowered 
teams from bringing ideas to reality, fostering 
connections across the organization, helping 
people to connect what they’re working on with the 
organization’s vision and aspiration, and encouraging 
an inclusive and welcoming environment where 
people bring their authentic selves to the office 
and pursue the full range of their aspirations.

performance,” McKinsey, August 2, 2022.

The State of Energy Organizations 20244. Getting the work done: 
Beyond control to evolution

Energy companies operate in a highly dynamic, 
unknown, and volatile environment, where major 
“black swan” opportunities and challenges are 
emerging with increasing frequency. As energy 
markets and related policies find a new equilibrium, 
organizations must keep an eye on the horizon to plan 
robustly for the uncertain future, while maintaining 
business continuity on their core value proposition.

Hence, in addition to the primary disciplined focus 
on executing today and cocreating tomorrow, 
leaders could build effective “first responder” 
capabilities to tackle major discontinuities within 
any business cycle. One senior executive in a 
traditional oil and gas company put it this way: “The 
old style was slow and steady decision making. But 
when you decided, you carried through with it. This 
doesn’t work in the energy transition. Instead of 
slow and flawless execution of large, incremental 
decisions, we need to rapidly learn and evolve.”

Successful leaders have traditionally managed their 
organizations through planning and control based 
on extensive analysis, while seeking to minimize 
disruptions. Today, leaders could learn to become 
comfortable with operating in shorter, rapid cycles. 
This requires increased focus on quick, low-risk 
decisions and experiments, learning from those 
that fail, and scaling those that succeed. Leaders 
could begin and end each rapid cycle with a 
retrospective to review progress, deepen learning, 
and plan for the next cycle. Each cycle could focus 
on a set of short-term outcomes, accomplished via 
prioritized deliverables and initiatives that reflect 
available short-term capacity and appropriately 
manage risk. Outcomes, deliverables, activities, 
and resources may be reprioritized during each 
cycle to reflect rapidly changing realities.

What this means for leadership in the new energy 
world is captured by the director of strategy at an 
offshore driller, who said: “In an industry where 
it is becoming increasingly challenging to raise 
capital, a sharp external focus and agile thinking 
can create opportunities.” The CEO of a traditional 
oil and gas service company summed up what 
many executives said: “We need to become 
entrepreneurial and nonbureaucratic. Being slow 
and considered may be important in large, traditional 
engineering projects, but this approach doesn’t 
work in the new energy space. Right now, we love 
to control and work in silos. This must change.”

The CEO of an integrated energy company 
emphasized the importance of empowering those 
who work in their organizations: “I want to see us 
acting more quickly, allowing employees to take 
decisions at the lowest level possible. We need 
to empower them to identify and make decisions 
without having to consult their bosses. It’s OK for 
us to make mistakes if we take accountability, fix 
them, and learn. It would be much worse if we didn’t 
make mistakes, which would tell me that we are not 
taking risks and are playing too safe.” Many of the 
leaders we interviewed emphasized the need to 
take risks to succeed in the emerging energy era.

For organizations to continually evolve in this 
emergent way, leaders may need to overcome 
status quo bias—to imagine a world or a market that 
is very different from what it is today. Recognizing 
the inherent challenges in such a transformation, 
a leader in a major energy company said: “In 
fairness, it is difficult as a leader to take your 
attention and resources from a business area that is 
already highly profitable, to focus on an extremely 
uncertain one.” Leaders in the energy sector may 
increasingly need to balance their attention between 
current activities and future opportunities.

51

The State of Energy Organizations 20245. Showing up as a leader: 
Beyond professional to human

Navigating this uncertainty is an immense challenge 
that will require best-in-class talent to solve complex 
problems. As traditional business models are 
disrupted, organizations in the energy industry will 
need to ensure they retain their core experienced 
workforce while attracting diversified talent in line 
with new business needs. The competition for talent 
is intense and potential employees are looking for 
more than financial compensation. Creating an 
attractive destination for top talent means fostering 
an inclusive employee experience. This influences 
whether employees remain and thrive, which in 
turn drives the company’s financial sustainability.

Leaders across all levels have a critical role to play 
in creating an environment where employees can 
bring their full authentic selves to work and feel 
empowered to pursue a sustainable work–life 
balance. For this to happen, leaders themselves 
need to show up with greater wholeness and 
authenticity. One industry executive connected 
this with the impact of the pandemic: “In COVID-
19, leaders had to become more authentic—we 
all went through the same war together. This is an 
asset now in terms of the leadership we need.”

One way this leadership manifests itself is in relation to 
the demand by today’s employees for more flexibility 
and autonomy.34 Leaders can facilitate this by allowing 
employees a degree of autonomy—empowering 
them to do their best work where they feel deeply 
motivated and energized. Another executive in the 
energy business effectively captures this role for 
leadership using a metaphor: “Think of it as driving 
on a highway. You can set some limits, like the road 
barriers on left and right. But once you set some 
boundaries, you must let others drive. You cannot 
take everyone on the back of a lorry that you are 
driving.” An executive in another global company 
reinforces this point: “Traditionally, there has been 
a lot of focus on presence in the office but, since 
COVID-19, employees demand flexibility. Many senior 
leaders find it hard to make this adjustment, and this 
could lead to high performers leaving the company.”

―

These five mindset and behavioral shifts could 
contribute to a unique and more powerful kind of 
leadership. When leaders identify and build the culture 
they want the organization to embody, they can create 
a virtuous cycle, attracting the right talent that will 
thrive, unlock their value agenda, and turbocharge 
their performance.

Where do we get the entrepreneurs we need now 
to lead in the next phase of the energy industry?

34   Dane Fetterer and Holger Reisinger, “Forget flexibility. Your employees want autonomy,” Harvard Business Review, October 29, 2021.

52

The State of Energy Organizations 2024However, the road to transformation is full of bumps 
and bends. Such shifts often require changing current 
systems and ways of operating, which will inevitably 
create some organizational resistance. Leaders may 
need to brace themselves for complexity and chaos, 
while demonstrating deep self-awareness, as they 
address their own embedded biases and overhaul 
their own mindsets for the new environment.

facing our world. Meeting these challenges requires 
the development of the extended characteristics of 
leadership we have highlighted here. The good news is 
that industry leaders are aware of the challenges and 
are consciously starting to address the demands of 
new leadership. This not only requires new talent from 
places outside the traditional energy sector, but also 
active transformation of existing leadership.

The transformation can also require organizations 
to commit to leadership development and a holistic 
cultural transformation—broad ideals and small 
incremental changes may no longer be sufficient. 
Emerging behaviors and mindsets cannot exist as 
mere slogans on a wall or in catchy email signatures. 
They require embodiment on a day-to-day basis, 
being continuously role-modeled by senior executives; 
integration into core business activities and specific 
actions; and demonstration in the moments  
that matter.

These are exciting times for the energy sector, given 
its placement at the center of the critical challenges 

One sector CEO summed up the challenges: “Where 
do we get the entrepreneurs we need now to lead in 
the next phase of the energy industry? You need some 
new leaders from outside the industry, in balance 
with those from the existing business. You need the 
new-energy zealots to provide inspiration, but you 
also need leaders to demonstrate that real practical 
progress is being made on the ground. We are finding 
that there are many ‘entrepreneurs in residence’—
leaders who are more incremental but who just need 
permission to be entrepreneurs. We need to    
activate them!”

Transforming an oil 
and gas equipment 
leader: A case study 

How one multinational services and equipment company embarked 
on a powerful transformation journey to overcome market challenges 
and position itself for a decarbonized future.    

By Robert Belanger and Neil Pearse 

54

The State of Energy Organizations 2024When a leading oil and gas services and equipment 
provider embraced a new vision to become a 
champion for decarbonization, it set in motion a 
holistic transformation program that would result in 
a 20 percent lift in gross income and a 35 percent 
increase in EBITDA after just one year.35 

Embraced by the organization: contributing 
to one common change story, delivered 
through a continuous organizational pulse.

Inspired by leadership: with leaders acting 
as role models for the new behaviors.

The need for drastic change became apparent in 
2020 when the company saw sales drop by around 20 
percent due to challenging market dynamics, including 
decarbonization and the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
company responded with a strategic shift—leading 
an “Energy Transition”—and sustaining its journey 
towards a low-carbon future with a large-scale  
cultural transformation. 

The multinational organization, which designs, 
manufactures, maintains, and upgrades equipment 
across the entire oil and gas value chain, operates 
in more than 120 countries and has around 
10,000 employees. To realize its new vision, the 
organization’s culture had to shift to be more inclusive, 
entrepreneurial, transparent, and globally diverse.

Starting with a common and 
inspiring change story

The organization embarked on a deep and sustained 
cultural transformation, taking a holistic bottom-
up and top-down approach to shape and deliver a 
compelling change story. The main focus areas were 
to “aspire” and “assess,” ensuring the leadership team 
worked together while listening to their employees. 

Focus groups acted as a cornerstone of the program. 
To develop the full change narrative, 80 employees 
attended three focus groups each, with the CEO 
and executive committee taking the insights, 
refining them, and sharing them back for further 
input. During these focus groups, people were:

Encouraged to take ownership (inside out): 
taking deep personal ownership of change and 
engaging in energetic personal transformations.

Given targeted actions (outside in): with 
change agents acting as the engine of change, 
creating “viral” energy across the organization.

Grounded in vital moments: identifying and 
targeting moments of truth (MOTs) and driving 
participation in action planning and monitoring.

The organization’s change story leveraged 
six from-to shifts that defined the aspirations 
of the cultural transformation. 

1. From a product mindset to a solution mindset. 
Employees needed to learn to think more 
like entrepreneurs—not simply making 
products function more efficiently, but also 
rethinking value propositions for customers.

2. From fear of failure to experimentation. The 

organization needed to reframe failure by shifting 
the focus from personal judgment to purposeful 
learning. To promote an “experiment and learn” 
culture, the organization would need to be willing 
to shut down projects when they led nowhere, 
without negatively judging project teams, and 
embrace the learnings that come from failure.

3. From slow, incremental innovation to fast, 

iterative innovation. The organization needed 
minimum viable products to launch into the 

35   EBITDA: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

55

The State of Energy Organizations 2024marketplace, in order to test them, fail, pivot, 
move forward, and change the speed at 
which it delivered innovation to customers.

4. From exclusivity to inclusivity. Success 

hinged on diversity of thought; embracing 
people from different backgrounds, and 
bringing in new ideas and capabilities.

5. From DIY to partnership. Partnering was 

encouraged with the broader organization, 
with outside partners, and, in some cases, by 
acquiring new capabilities and technologies 
to find paths to differentiation. This required 
a shift from a “control and threat” mindset to 
one of partnership as a win–win with partners 
and suppliers. It also required a shift from 
micromanagement to trust and respect.

6. From reactive to proactive. The organization 
needed to stop waiting for emergency 
signals before implementing change and to 
start leading the way from the get-go.

Change agents were engaged through 
focus groups, taking three key actions:

Architect action plans. Each business unit’s change 
agent created a detailed action plan, leveraging 
the Influence Model—a framework for how to 
change mindsets and behaviors in an organization. 
Plans were defined autonomously in a bottom-up 
approach: the central team provided advice and 
counsel but no instructions on specific actions.

Touchpoints to drive action. Regular touchpoint 
calls were organized in each business unit to 
support the execution of action plans. Plenary calls 
allowed change agents to celebrate successes 
and share best practices and lessons learned.

Advanced onboarding or renewal. Change 
agents who could no longer devote time to 
the transformation were given the chance to 
“retire,” with new change agents onboarded in 
business units that needed additional help.

Scaling initiatives: A three-
layered transformation

The organization partnered with a McKinsey team 
and promoted change in two directions: “inside-out” 
change, which involved agents choosing to change 
their own behavior; and “outside-in” change, where 
agents were encouraged to change by external stimuli. 

The team led the organization’s transformation across 
three layers, with three initiatives implemented in each 
layer to achieve maximum impact—operating across 
the self, team, and broader organization layers.

The ‘change self’ layer

The inside-out “change self” layer focused on 
management and change agents. First, each member 
of the organization’s top team was encouraged 
to formulate individual “from–to” goals, as part of 
their personal transformation. These were explicit, 
aspirational plans, based on where they were   
and where they wanted to be, according to  
specific indicators. 

Next, two-day Personal Ownership Workshops 
were implemented to encourage participants to 
reflect deeply on their roles as leaders. More than 
20 workshops were held, catalyzing transformation 
through commitment, a shared language, and set of 
habits manifesting the organization’s new culture.

Leadership coaching formed the third initiative in this 
layer. One-on-one coaching for the organization’s top 
ten executives helped to position them as role models 
in the changing organization.

The ‘change team’ layer

The vital role of change agents 

This outside-in “change team” layer focused on 
team dynamics. The first activity included team 
activation sessions, delivered through a series of 
tailored workshops reinforcing team collaboration and 
openness. These were designed to align managers 
with the overall cultural aspiration in order to support 
them in sharing the change story.

Next, cross-team collaboration workshops  
helped to unlock critical collaboration challenges 
between teams, in line with the themes of the   
cultural transformation.

Lastly, leadership capability-building sessions helped 
to stimulate dialogue and organizational learning on 
diversity and inclusion.

The ‘change organization’ layer

This outside-in “change organization” layer sought 
to foster change among all employees across the 
organization, through the creation of a powerful 
change story. This was reinforced by personal MOT 
stories, shared by employees. The fusion of personal 
MOTs with the organization’s story enabled employees 
to invest in the change and bring the overall change 
story to life.

Second, a series of focus groups was held to collect 
input on the change from 150 employees. The focus 
groups explored organizational challenges and 
employee suggestions of possible solutions. 

The last initiative involved change agents—mobilizing 
more than 200 change agents to drive change 
activities on the ground. 

The initial focus group attendees became the 
core change agent group. Change agents were 
voluntary and did not have a dedicated time. They 
had a great deal of autonomy to develop bottom-
up action plans and they also provided sensing and 
upwards feedback on transformation progress. 

Measuring impact: Not 
just about performance 

After two years, around 200 change agents were 
active across the network, and after 30 months, 
the transformation produced meaningful impact 
on the organization’s performance and people. 

In the first quarter of 2022, the organization 
witnessed an increase in sales growth of more 
than 50 percent from the previous year. In 
the first year after the transformation, gross 
income grew more than 20 percent and 
EBITDA by 35 percent (2021 versus 2020). 

After undergoing the various initiatives, 85 
percent of people in the organization understood 
the “why” of the transformation and more than 
75 percent could see the desired new behaviors 
in place. More than 90 percent of respondents 
to a culture survey started making conscious 
efforts to be proactive; 87 percent took actions 
to be more inclusive; and 62 percent noticed 
behavioral changes in the leaders of their units.

57

The State of Energy Organizations 2024 
Respondents shared thoughtful insights about the 
qualitative impact of the intervention. One said: 
“This is a great initiative. It gives our organization 
the opportunity to reflect on our behaviors and 
the way we’ve been working for decades.”

Another reflected on the importance of 
recognizing growth: “We should all be proud 
of our progress. It reflects the commitment 
and hard work of our leadership, our change 
agents, and everybody in the organization.”

―

Shaken by challenging market conditions, the 
organization embarked on a broad intervention to 
align its culture with its vision to become a leader  
in decarbonization.

Through a powerful change story, workshops, focus 
groups, and a three-layered, bidirectional process of 
transformation, the multinational achieved the wide-
scale participation and ownership needed to achieve 
its vision. The transformation succeeded in growing 
sales and income.

One survey respondent described the importance of 
the program and maintaining focus going forward: “A 
vibrant, empowered, contemporary culture enables 
us to tackle business challenges and charge into the 
future with confidence and agility. We must keep 
up the momentum and focus on entrenching the ‘to’ 
behaviors in everything we do.”

Success in the M&A 
rebound: Riding 
the coming wave of 
upstream deals 

Historically high cash generation across the North American 
upstream industry could create the perfect market conditions for 
accelerated M&A activity for market leaders. 

By Robert Belanger, Jeremy Brown, and Tom Grace
Published on McKinsey.com, February 24, 2023.

59

The State of Energy Organizations 2024The oil and gas industry has a long and storied history 
of M&A transactions and strategic dealmaking. 
Inorganic investment decisions have shaped the 
portfolios of industry players and determined the 
ultimate success and long-term growth trajectories of 
these companies. With the industry on the precipice of 
historically high cash flows, we expect another wave of 
M&A to dominate near-term actions.

This article explores the cash flow landscape and 
major cash flow deployment levers and shows how the 
stage has been set for an upstream M&A wave. We 
introduce the M&A strategies driving consolidation 
and what it takes to succeed in the coming M&A wave.

Cash flow is king 

Long gone are the days of “growth at all costs” with 
expanding capital budgets, acreage acquisition 
campaigns, and associated negative cash flow 
realizations funded by inexpensive debt.36 Over 
the past few years, investor sentiment has 
driven the oil and gas industry to practice capital 

discipline and prioritize financial resiliency and 
cash flow generation above growth.37 When 
prices surged in 2022, upstream companies 
maintained their strategy of “no-to-low” capital 
growth. This focus on capital discipline and cash 
generation has resulted in record cash flows.

We examined historical cash flows and projected 
operational and financial performance for 
25 leading North American exploration and 
production companies (E&Ps), and the results are 
impressive: operating free cash flows (FCF) reached 
approximately $85 billion in 2022, with a year-end 
cash balance of $70 billion to $100 billion (Exhibit 
15).38 This industry turnaround is dramatic, given 
negative cash generation the previous three years. 
Free cash flows are projected to remain high, with 
levels of between $70 billion and $90 billion in 
2023 and between $50 billion and $70 billion for 
the following four years—even if oil prices drop to 
around $65 to $70 per barrel over the coming years.

The primary tool left in the corporate finance 
tool kit is deployment of cash through M&A.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Making all the right moves . . . 
until there’s only one option left

Operators are taking advantage of their high cash 
flows by pulling all the traditional levers of capital 
management, shoring up their balance sheets, 
and returning value to shareholders (Exhibit 16). 
However, there is so much cash coming in that many 
of these levers are hitting a natural cap or are already 
exhausted. We analyzed how these companies are 
using operating cash flow across key levers, including:

•  Capital expenditure (capex) reinvestment. 
E&Ps across the sector have explicitly 
announced their intention to maintain capital 
discipline going forward, only increasing in 
line with inflation, even if prices remain high.39  
If this trend continues, capex will likely be 
constrained to current guidance issued by 
these companies, indicating a cap on future 
cash flow allocation for this purpose.

•  Debt reduction. Debt load for the 25 E&Ps 

decreased by $25 billion from 2021 to 2022 and 
is forecast to decrease by another $15 billion 
to $20 billion by 2027.40 Forecasted net debt 
for many operators may approach zero—an 
outcome unthinkable just a few years ago. 
Payments are expected to be capped at expiring 
notes only, reaching up to $10 billion in 2023.

•  Shareholder returns. With debt burdens reduced, 
direct returns are expected to be the priority. 
Share buybacks tripled from 2021 to 2022, 
reaching a high of $21 billion for 25 leading 
independents and representing approximately 5 
percent of total outstanding shares.41 Likewise, 
dividends doubled over this period to reach an 
all-time high of $23 billion, and are expected to 
climb to between $30 billion and $40 billion over 
the next year. However, direct returns will likely 
also have a natural ceiling in the range of 25 to 
30 percent of total sector operating cash flow.42  

•  Energy transition. Many operators are investing 
to reduce their Scope 1 & 2 emissions or 
make early moves to participate in energy-
transition value chains. However, we expect 
a ceiling of 5 percent of operating cash 
flow to be allocated to these efforts.43  

Even after these uses of cash have been exhausted, 
the industry is likely to remain cash flow positive in 
2023 and beyond, with a “war chest” of hundreds 
of billions of dollars in 2023 alone for the 25 North 
American E&Ps analyzed, including estimated current 
cash balances. The primary tool left in the corporate 
finance tool kit is deployment of cash through M&A.

Who’s coming to dinner?

The oil and gas industry is, in many ways, the epitome 
of competition and free market capitalism. A common 
refrain from industry veterans discussing M&A is, “You 
are either at the table, or you’re on it.” This is a harsh 
reality, but companies with strong M&A capabilities 
and bold strategies often exit the cycle fully fed 
and healthy. Dealmaking in the North American 

upstream sector in 2022 generated relatively low 
upstream transaction value compared to previous 
years, due to a range of factors in the upstream 
sector, such as high oil prices and macroeconomic 
factors impacting all sectors, including geopolitical 
instability, inflation, and the possibility of recession 
(Exhibit 17). However, our analysis of the fundamentals 
indicates that a new M&A wave is coming.

Industry trends suggest that multiple M&A strategies 
are driving this next wave of consolidation activity. 
Basin consolidators (such as Colgate and Centennial) 
will likely look to add scale and leverage operational 
advantages to achieve outsized returns. Integrators 
(like EQT with the acquisition of Tug Hill) may seek 
to add assets in adjacent portions of the value chain 
to expand margins and increase resiliency. The bold 
(for instance, BP and the acquisition of Archaea) will 
probably use a portion of their cash stockpiles to seed 
businesses to reshape their portfolios and position for 
the energy transition. Overall, consolidators (eaters 
at the table) will likely be those that have pulled the 
operational levers to have better cash flows than their 
geographically proximate competitors.

―

The oil and gas industry is entering a period of 
unprecedented uncertainty characterized by the 
energy transition, evolving investor sentiment, and 
mounting concerns around energy security. While our 
industry should be proud of recent performance, now 
is not the time to bask in the glow of success. As in the 
past, successful industry players will work tirelessly 
to define and deliver a strategy rooted in sound 
M&A investments—honing their evaluation skills and 
integration capabilities—to accelerate their future 
growth and performance.

The next article in this series will discuss what it takes 
to succeed. Until then, we leave you with one thought:

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Beyond G&A: 
Maximizing synergy 
from oil and gas 
mergers 

In the coming consolidation wave, exploration and production 
companies can raise the aspiration on deal synergy and move  
beyond G&A.

By Jeremy Brown, Tom Grace, and Steve Miller 
Published on McKinsey.com, April 18, 2023.

65

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are a key tool in a 
company’s value creation toolbox. Despite a highly 
turbulent macroeconomic environment over the past 
decade, M&A activity in the oil and gas sector has 
continued, albeit at lower levels than prior years.44 
Now, a new M&A wave is expected, driven by record 
cash flow in the exploration and production (E&P) 
sector, among other factors.45  

In this next wave, differentiated value creation will 
likely underpin M&A success, and set M&A winners 
apart. Many upstream firms view acquisitions as a 
“bread-and-butter” activity that they do well. However, 
more than 50 percent of deals in the E&P sector don’t 
create value for shareholders.46 Many deals are limited 
to a focus on reducing general and administrative 
(G&A) expenses and ignore any operational synergies 
that may exist. There is a lost opportunity here for 
firms to raise their synergy aspirations and look 
beyond G&A, as M&A deals pursued for operational 

synergies typically outperform those based on G&A 
savings. In addition, the choice to publicly announce 
synergy targets can impact the total return to 
shareholders (TRS). By making clever decisions, 
companies can reap the most from their deals.

In this article, we explore two steps that upstream 
companies could take to maximize value from their 
deals and build resiliency ahead of the next cycle.

Most deals don’t create value

Over the past 12 years, there have been roughly 
750 upstream deals with a transaction value of 
at least $100 million.47 Although most deals were 
less than $1 billion in size, deals greater than 
$1 billion have contributed the largest portion 
of transaction value since 2016 (Exhibit 18).

The most successful mergers are usually those that 
adopt a transformative approach to value capture.

uncertainties, outlooks for oil and gas prices, and 
transaction management.49 But in all cases, the ability 
to accrue differentiated value creation is a key factor 
determining merger success and may determine the 
winners in the next cycle.

One plus one equals 
three: Maximize value by 
moving beyond G&A

All too often, upstream deals have limited their 
synergy goals to the low-hanging fruit of G&A 
reductions. Our experience shows, however, that 
operational synergies are almost always larger than 
G&A savings—often by a factor of three or more.

68

The State of Energy Organizations 2024The most successful mergers are usually those 
that adopt a transformative approach to value 
capture, systematically pursuing synergies across 
financial categories and functions, including 
operations. Upstream companies can open the 
aperture across revenue and production, operating 
costs, and capital efficiency in addition to G&A, 
using the merger as a “moment in time” to catalyze 
performance improvement across both entities.

Pursuing operational and production synergies with 
rigor equal to (or greater than) G&A cost synergies 
also has an important change-management dynamic. 

While reducing headcount and other expenses 
is usually viewed as a necessary evil that often 
generates negative emotion, developing additional 
revenue through operational excellence can drive 
energy and excitement and offer teams a point of 
pride to rally around. Operational synergies have 
the added benefit of being a buffer in case G&A 
synergies are harder to obtain than expected.

Our work has highlighted that successful 
mergers approach operational synergies 
from three main angles (Exhibit 20).50

The State of Energy Organizations 2024Leading companies often ask the following questions 
when considering M&A:

1.  What are the direct operational synergies to be 

extracted, either from an overlap (or adjacency in 
footprint) or from an expanded size and scale?

2.  How can we leverage the best-of-the-best 

capabilities from each organization, using both 
data and capabilities to scale opportunities 
across portfolios?

3.  How can new opportunities be catalyzed in this 
unique moment to realize step changes  
in performance?

Firms that strive to become world-class serial 
dealmakers may engineer answers to these questions 
into a repeatable “deal machine,” which they 
continually improve while proactively strengthening 
the muscle memory of how to run it.

Publicly announce synergy goals

To announce, or not to announce, that is the 
question. Once synergies have been planned and 
targeted, they can be announced—internally or 
externally. At a minimum, targets, or goals, can 
be clearly communicated internally, with discreet 
goals set for each part of the combined business. 
This mobilizes the entire organization to drive 
performance, while offering a clear rationale for 
decision makers to anchor the many tough calls that 
will likely be required during the integration process.

But announcing targets externally can increase the 
chance that deals create value (Exhibit 21). While there 
is a negligible link between communicating additional 
information about the deal and the initial market 
reaction, announcing cost-synergy expectations 
may be tied to significant long-term outperformance 
over peers. Our analysis of 776 deals across sectors 
showed that companies that announced synergy 
targets outperformed those that did not by an 
incremental 7 percent TRS over a median of two years.

Publicly announcing targets can contribute to putting 
healthy pressure on the executives and support teams 
who will have their compensation linked to meeting 
targets. As the onus is on the company to deliver, this 
can encourage executive teams to tackle the difficult 
decisions included in initial synergy estimates instead 
of opting for an easier route. To ensure delivery, 

publicly announced targets are typically supported 
by internal targets that are up to 200 percent 
higher, even in the case of value leakage.51 Public 
announcements also allow investors to understand 
where the synergies are coming from, instead of the 
deal being a black box.

to adjust the synergy goals used in approval to better 
match the actual delivery. To counter this behavior, 
top CEOs may require their teams to place a record 
of synergy objectives in a figurative time-locked 
safe with the initial opening set for the first executive 
lookback on deal success. There will likely be both 
positive and negative variances against the goal, but 
only by knowing where gaps exist can teams fine-
tune estimation and delivery methods to  
continually improve.

In the next wave of upstream M&A, differentiated 
value creation may be a key factor underpinning 
merger success. By pursuing operational synergies 
beyond G&A and publicly announcing synergy 
targets, companies can maximize the value from their 
mergers—and accelerate their growth  
and performance.

The importance of 
cultural integration 
in M&A: The path to 
success 

Culture management is a vital aspect of integrations during mergers 
and acquisitions and, with the right measures, cultural alignment can 
drive vastly improved returns.

The State of Energy Organizations 2024For many companies, successful M&A is a critical 
aspect of their long-term strategy—and a clear 
pathway to accelerated growth. In the past decade, 
M&A accounted for $8.3 trillion of capital deployment 
for the world’s 2,000 largest companies across all 
sectors. M&A is also a large contributor to growth, 
and McKinsey analysis has shown that it can be 
responsible for driving 75 percent of growth.52 Despite 
this, the rate of failure is high, standing at between 70 
and 90 percent.53 

Organizations that acquire successfully have 
distinctive capabilities at every stage of the process. 
Qualities they have embedded at deep institutional 
levels include reallocating M&A capital regularly, 
having clearly defined “go” and “no go” criteria, 
knowing when to walk away from deals, and the ability 
to focus relentlessly on value creation in integration 
planning and execution. A capability that is often 
overlooked, however, is the ability to manage culture 
throughout the M&A process.

In this article, we explore how culture can be used to 
drive success during integration and how by managing 
culture efficiently, companies in the energy sector 
could improve costs and revenue following M&As. 

Culture can improve M&A success  

Culture—both within the acquiring firm and throughout 
the integration planning process for targets—is critical 
to creating value through M&A.54 This is especially true 
for cross-border or step-out integrations, for example, 
to gain a foothold in new lower carbon segments. 

Differences in the cultures of organizations can 
exist at any level and have the potential to seriously 
disrupt operations and jeopardize integration 
processes. For example, companies may differ in 
their cultures around decision making—one may 
have a top-down, directive culture while the other’s 
is consultative and process-driven. Such issues 
are especially common where large, established 
energy players are acquiring smaller start-ups.

Failing to align culture could meaningfully 
inhibit the companies’ prospects of smoothly 
integrating and capturing the anticipated 
value. Similarly, parties in an M&A must align in 
areas such as accountability, communication, 
innovation, and operational management. 

Our research shows that companies that manage 
culture effectively in their integration planning 
are around 50 percent more likely to meet or 
exceed their synergy targets—across both 
cost and revenue synergies (Exhibit 22).

Companies that effectively manage culture during integration planning are more 
likely to capture cost and revenue synergies.

Three steps to improve 
cultural integration  

Evidence from McKinsey’s integration 
engagements in energy and beyond suggests 
that managing culture through the M&A process 
successfully could depend on three steps: 

Diagnosing “how work gets done” by establishing 
a cultural baseline. Doing this allows for the 
identification of common strengths that can be 
built upon between the organizations, revealing 
potential transformation opportunities, as well as 
differences that may cause friction. While recognizing 
differences, it is important not to exaggerate them 
or think of them as differences between “good” and 
“bad” cultures: companies can succeed equally with 

very different cultural strengths, and aspects of each 
culture can be brought in during the transition.

Prioritizing cultural aspirations for the integrated 
company by articulating the future culture and 
tailoring the integration approach to support 
these priorities. The cultural program can’t be 
viewed as an isolated job—it must be interwoven 
with all integration initiatives. And, for the 
program to achieve true behavioral change, it 
must resonate with people on a personal level, 
requiring rational and emotional intervention 
throughout the change management process.

Driving change, with leaders in both companies 
developing a ‘change story’ to plot the desired cultural 
transformation and determining a set of targeted 
initiatives for building toward the desired culture.

(to both the leaders and employees in the acquirer 
and target organizations). Alignment among the 
top team—as well as role modeling—is crucial for 
success. These new leaders may be called upon to 
sponsor activities to keep things moving forward.

Lack of attention to culture management can be 
a major hurdle to the success of M&As. But by 
applying an integration strategy giving due attention 
to culture, this need not be the case. Research 

suggests that M&A deals that deploy advanced culture 
management strategies far outperform those that do 
not. Companies in the energy sector could replicate 
these successes by performing a cultural diagnosis, 
prioritizing cultural aspirations, and driving change 
among the leadership in the target organization and 
acquirer alike.
