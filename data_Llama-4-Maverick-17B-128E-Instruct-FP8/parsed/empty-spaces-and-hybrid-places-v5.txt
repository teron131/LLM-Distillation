This research examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on real estate in “superstar” cities 
in the United States, Europe, and Asia. That real estate has not kept up with shifts in behavior 
caused by the pandemic. The cities’ vibrancy is at risk, and they will have to adapt. 

 — Hybrid work is here to stay. As a result, office attendance has stabilized at 30 percent below 

prepandemic norms.

 — The ripple effects of hybrid work are substantial. Untethered from their offices, residents 
have left urban cores and shifted their shopping elsewhere. For example, New York City’s 
urban core lost 5 percent of its population from mid-2020 to mid-2022, and San Francisco’s 
lost 7 percent. Urban vacancy rates have shot up. Foot traffic near stores in metropolitan 
areas remains 10 to 20 percent below prepandemic levels. 

 — Demand for office and retail space in superstar cities will remain below prepandemic 

levels. In a moderate scenario that we modeled, demand for office space is 13 percent lower 
in 2030 than it was in 2019 for the median city in our study. In a severe scenario, demand falls 
by 38 percent in the most heavily affected city.

 — Real estate is local, and demand will vary substantially by neighborhood and city. 

Demand may be lower in neighborhoods and cities characterized by dense office space, 
expensive housing, and large employers in the knowledge economy.

 — Cities and buildings can adapt and thrive by taking hybrid approaches themselves. 

Priorities might include developing mixed-use neighborhoods, constructing more adaptable 
buildings, and designing multiuse office and retail space.

Executive summary

When the COVID-19 pandemic began, it dramatically changed the way people worked, lived, 
and shopped in cities around the world. The starkest change was where and how they worked. 
Obeying lockdowns and office closures, tired of uncomfortable masks, and enabled by remote-
work technology, many employees abruptly retreated from traditional offices to home offices. 
Many of those employees, newly freed from their daily commutes, chose to move out of urban 
cores. And now that fewer of them were working and living near urban stores, fewer of them 
shopped there. In recent months, some of those behavioral shifts have slowed. Others persist, 
particularly among office employees continuing to engage in hybrid work (that is, a combination 
of remote and in-office work).

The behavioral shifts have already had major effects on real estate in “superstar” cities—roughly 
speaking, cities with a disproportionate share of the world’s urban GDP and GDP growth.  
In superstar cities’ urban cores, the percentage of office and retail space that is vacant has 
grown sharply since 2019, and home prices have increased more slowly than in the suburbs and 
other cities. 

To what extent could real estate in superstar cities continue to suffer? In this research, the 
McKinsey Global Institute has modeled future demand for office, residential, and retail space 
in several scenarios.1 In those scenarios, demand for office and retail space is generally lower in 
2030 than it was in 2019, though the anticipated reductions in our moderate scenario are smaller 
than those projected by many other researchers. Our analysis also shows that the ripple effects 
will be complex—for example, that certain kinds of cities and neighborhoods will be more heavily 
affected than others. We considered a wide variety of factors, including long-term population 
trends; employment trends, such as the ongoing effects of automation; office attendance 
patterns by industry; employee coordination, defined as the maximum share of workers in the 
office at a given time; workers’ ages and incomes; the share of a city’s population that commutes 
from elsewhere; housing price variation among neighborhoods; and shopping trends, such as 
the ongoing increase in online shopping. In addition to many secondary sources, our modeling 
includes information from a large global survey that we conducted to understand the behavioral 
shifts caused by the pandemic.

We performed this research during a time of exceptional macroeconomic uncertainty. Inflation 
and interest rates are high; fears of recession are mounting; stress in the financial system has 
been making headlines. Actual outcomes, of course, will depend on how those variables and 
others play out.

What is certain is that urban real estate in superstar cities around the world faces substantial 
challenges. And those challenges could imperil the fiscal health of cities, many of which are 
already straining to address homelessness, transit needs, and other pressing issues. But the 
challenges also provide an opportunity to spur a historic transformation of urban spaces. By 
becoming more flexible and adaptable in everything from the makeup of neighborhoods to the 
design of buildings—in essence, becoming more “hybrid” themselves—superstar cities can not 
only adapt but thrive.

1  The research considers only those three asset classes: office, residential, and retail space. Others, such as industrial space 

and self-storage space, are outside the scope of the research.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateHow hybrid work has changed the way people work, live, and shop

During the pandemic, workers’ office attendance plummeted. Untethered from their daily 
commutes, urbanites moved away from urban cores in greater numbers than they had before  
the pandemic (and fewer people moved in), and people spent less in urban stores (see Box E1, 
“How we define cities”). The rate of out-migration has now returned to its prepandemic trend, but 
our research suggests that few of the people who left will return and that urban shopping will not 
fully recover. 

Box E1
How we define cities 

This report is about real estate in superstar cities—roughly speaking, cities with a 
disproportionate share of the world’s urban GDP and GDP growth. We have borrowed 
the term and the concept from the 2018 MGI report Superstars: The dynamics of firms, 
sectors, and cities leading the global economy. The report does not examine real estate 
outside superstar cities.

By city, we usually mean a large metropolitan area. Our analysis often separates such a 
metropolitan area into two parts: the urban core, which refers to the densest part of the 
area, and the suburbs, which refers to everything outside the urban core. For example, 
when we discuss San Francisco’s urban core, we mean San Francisco County, Alameda 
County, and San Mateo County. And when we discuss San Francisco’s suburbs, we  
mean the rest of the San Francisco metropolitan area (that is, Marin County and Contra 
Costa County).

We focus most closely on nine superstar cities: Beijing, Houston, London, New York City, 
Paris, Munich, San Francisco, Shanghai, and Tokyo. However, in the survey that underlies 
much of this report, we collected data from a larger set of 17 superstar cities in six countries 
in order to better understand behavior. At one point in our research, we were able to extend 
our analysis to a still larger set of 24 superstar cities to help us identify patterns  
in suburbanization.

Hybrid work is here to stay, and office attendance is down by 30 percent
Employees still spend far less time working at the office than they did before the pandemic, 
according to our survey. In early 2020, as they adopted remote work and hybrid work in response 
to lockdowns and health concerns, office attendance in the metropolitan areas we studied 
dropped by up to 90 percent. It has since recovered substantially but remains down by about  
30 percent, on average. As of October 2022, office workers were visiting the office about  
3.5 days per week. That number varied among cities, from 3.1 days in London to 3.9 in Beijing. 
(For more information about the survey, see the technical appendix.)

Office attendance also varies by industry and neighborhood. In large firms in the knowledge 
economy—which we define as the professional services, information, and finance industries—
employees tend to go to the office fewer days per week (Exhibit E1). Characteristics of areas 
with lower office attendance include expensive housing, a higher ratio of inbound commuters to 
residents, and a small share of retail, according to our research on US counties. Local culture also 
plays a role.

There are several reasons to believe that the current rate of office attendance could persist. First, 
the rate has remained fairly stable since mid-2022. Second, three key numbers—the number 
of days per week that survey respondents go to the office (3.5), the number of days they expect 
to go to the office after the pandemic ends (3.7), and their preferred number (3.2)—are not far 
apart. Third, 10 percent of the people we surveyed said that they were both likely to quit their 
jobs if required to work at the office every day and willing to take a substantial pay cut if doing 
so let them work from home when they wanted. That group contains many senior, high-income 
employees, suggesting that they may wield influence over companies’ decisions. Nevertheless, it 
is not certain that the current rate of office attendance will persist; it could change, for example, 
if labor market dynamics shift or if research conclusively indicates either a negative or a positive 
relationship between hybrid work and productivity.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateUp to 7 percent of the people in urban cores left for good
During the pandemic, a wave of households left the urban cores of superstar cities, and fewer 
households moved in. For example, New York City’s urban core lost 5 percent of its population 
from mid-2020 to mid-2022, and San Francisco’s lost 7 percent. The main reason was out-
migration. In the suburbs, by contrast, populations grew, or they shrank less dramatically than 
populations in the urban cores did. In the United States, suburbanization had already been 
happening before the pandemic, and the shock accelerated an existing trend; by contrast, in 
most of the European and Japanese cities we studied, urbanization gave way to suburbanization 
(Exhibit E2).

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateThe urban cores where population growth was smallest in relation to their suburbs tended to 
be those with expensive homes, high office density, a high share of workers in the knowledge 
economy, and limited retail presence—some of the same characteristics that shaped office 
attendance. London, Dallas, New York, San Francisco, and Boston were the most affected. In 
general, US urban cores were more affected than European and Japanese ones, which tend to 
have more mixed-use development, in which office, residential, and retail space exist alongside 
one another. The migration trends in Beijing were primarily shaped by prepandemic efforts 
to control the population size in urban cores by encouraging out-migration, efforts that were 
paused during the pandemic. 

Hybrid work seems to have contributed significantly to out-migration. In our survey, among respondents 
who moved after March 2020, 20 percent said that their move was possible only because they could 
now work from home more frequently. In the United Kingdom and the United States, people who had 
moved from urban cores to suburbs, and who said that their move was possible only because they could 
now work from home, said that they were drawn by housing conditions: better neighborhoods, the 
prospect of homeownership, and outdoor space. In Japan and China, wanting to own a home was far and 
away the strongest factor motivating people’s moves to the suburbs.

Out-migration from urban cores of superstar cities seems to have slowed, but it is still above 
prepandemic levels. From 2019 to 2021, net out-migration from US superstar city cores doubled; 
then it fell in 2022, although it remained above 2019 rates. In other words, the people who moved 
out during the pandemic are not moving back, and others keep leaving. 

Shopping remains depressed, especially in urban cores
As people stayed home during the pandemic, they radically shifted the way they shopped. Foot 
traffic plummeted near stores in the cities we studied, and online spending as a share of retail 
spending spiked. 

More recently, foot traffic near stores in metropolitan areas has risen again, but it is still 10 to 
20 percent lower than it was before the pandemic. A major reason for the decline is that online 
spending as a share of retail spending, which admittedly grew more slowly after the initial spike, 
nevertheless remains higher than it was in 2019. 

Retailers in urban cores face particularly acute challenges in attracting customers. As of October 
2022, foot traffic had recovered noticeably less near those stores than near suburban ones 
(Exhibit E3). In New York, for example, foot traffic near suburban stores was 16 percent lower 
than it had been in January 2020, but foot traffic near urban stores was 36 percent lower. And 
office-dense neighborhoods in urban cores are facing even more challenges. The reason seems 
to be that when people come to the office less often, they shop less often near the office. In our 
survey, respondents in the United States who worked at the office no more than one day per 
week reported doing much less of their total retail spending near the office than did those who 
worked in the office two to five days a week. 

Out-migration from urban cores 
of superstar cities seems to 
have slowed, but it is still above 
prepandemic levels.

The impact on real estate

The behavioral changes caused by the pandemic—lower office attendance, accelerated 
out-migration from cities, and less shopping in office-heavy neighborhoods—will push down 
demand for real estate in most superstar cities. By 2030, in the scenarios we modeled, 
demand for office and retail space is generally lower than it was in 2019 (Exhibit E4). 
Residential space is less affected, though the price differences between urban cores and 
suburbs are narrower than they used to be. (Note that our model does not consider price 
elasticity; that is, it does not account for the fact that when demand decreases, prices fall, 
pushing demand partway back up. For more information about the model, see the  
technical appendix.)

In a moderate scenario, demand for office and retail space falls sharply 
between 2019 and 2030.

Value of office space  
at stake by 2030

There will be 13 percent less demand for office space in the median city we studied
Demand for office space has already declined, partly because of the increase in remote work and 
partly because of a challenging macroeconomic environment. Vacancy rates have increased in all 
the cities we studied. In the US cities, transaction volume (the total dollar value of all sales) fell by 
57 percent, average sale price per square foot fell by 20 percent, and asking rents fell by nearly 
22 percent (all in real terms) from 2019 to 2022. In San Francisco, the most strongly affected city 
in the United States, the share of office space that was vacant was ten percentage points higher 
in 2022 than it was in 2019, transaction volume was 79 percent lower, sale prices per square foot 
were 24 percent lower, and asking rents were 28 percent lower (also in real terms). The decline 
in demand has prompted tenants—wary about current macroeconomic conditions, uncertain 
about how much their workers will come to the office, and therefore uncertain about how much 
space they will need—to negotiate shorter leases from owners. Shorter leases, in turn, may make 
it more difficult for owners to obtain financing or may cause banks to adjust valuation models, 
which rely in part on the duration of existing leases. 

In the scenarios we modeled, the amount of office space demanded in most cities does not return 
to prepandemic levels for decades. By 2030, demand is as much as 20 percent lower than it was 
in 2019, depending on the city.2 That estimate is what our model yields in a moderate scenario—
one in which, by 2025, office attendance is higher than it is now but still lower than it was before 
the pandemic, and that partial recovery continues indefinitely.3 In a more severe scenario, in 
which attendance for all office workers in 2030 falls to the rate already seen in large firms in 
the knowledge economy, demand is as much as 38 percent lower than it was in 2019, again 
depending on the city. 

Falling demand will drive down value. In the nine cities we studied, a total of $800 billion (in real 
terms) in value is at stake by 2030 in the moderate scenario. On average, the total value of office 
space declines by 26 percent from 2019 to 2030 in the moderate scenario and by 42 percent in 
the severe one. The impact on value could be even stronger if rising interest rates compound it. 
Similarly, the impact could be stronger if troubled financial institutions decide to more quickly 
reduce the price of property they finance or own.

Falling demand will also result in a surplus of office space, particularly in the lower-quality and 
older buildings that the real estate industry calls Class B and Class C. From 2020 to 2022, rents, 
demand, and sometimes prices generally grew more quickly (or fell less sharply) for Class A 
buildings than for Class B buildings in US superstar cities. For example, in New York City during 
that period, the average sale price per square foot rose 3 percent for Class A buildings but fell 
by 8 percent for Class B buildings.4 There are a number of reasons for this “flight to quality.” One 
is that many employers see high-quality space as a way to encourage office attendance among 
their employees. Another is that Class B and Class C office space is often not suited to hybrid 
work; for example, it may have less sophisticated audiovisual equipment. Also, now that hybrid 
work has reduced the total amount of space that employers need, they can spend their budgets 
on smaller amounts of higher-quality space rather than larger amounts of lower-quality space.

2  When we projected demand for office space in Beijing and Shanghai, we studied only the urban cores of those cities. When 
we projected demand for office space in the other superstar cities, we studied larger areas, usually but not always the entire 
metropolitan areas.

3  Our model considers peak weekly attendance rather than average weekly attendance. It also takes into account the continued 
trend toward more desks in less space as well as projections of population growth, shifts in urban migration, and the share of 
office workers as the knowledge economy grows but feels the impact of automation.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateDemand growth for residences will be muted, especially in urban cores 
During the pandemic, partly because of out-migration, demand for residences grew less 
quickly in superstar urban cores than it did in suburbs and other cities. Residential vacancy 
rates increased from 2019 to 2022 in every superstar urban core that we studied, from a 
0.8-percentage-point increase in Tokyo to a 9.9-percentage-point increase in London; 
meanwhile, in the suburbs, vacancy rates grew much less or even declined.5 Prices followed suit, 
rising eight percentage points more slowly in US superstar urban cores than in their suburbs and 
13 percentage points more slowly than in non-superstar urban cores. In San Francisco, nominal 
prices in some neighborhoods fell by 12 percent from the end of 2019 to 2022. Residences in San 
Francisco’s urban core are now worth $750 billion less than they would have been if prices there 
had risen at the national average rate. The effect seems to be a global phenomenon. 

Before price adjustments are accounted for, the demand for residences in superstar urban 
cores that we modeled is up to 10 percent lower by 2030 than it would have been if not for the 
pandemic. It is nevertheless higher than it was in 2019 in every city we studied except San 
Francisco and Paris. That estimate rests on the assumption that the wave of residents who left 
urban cores will not return but that population growth in each city will return to its prepandemic 
rate by 2024. Should population growth remain depressed for longer, the impact on demand 
would be even bigger. 

However, prices will probably adjust, and so will rents. Again, our model does not account for 
such price adjustments, so we could not create demand scenarios that incorporated them. But 
we can say that homes in urban cores are unlikely to stay empty. Residential space differs from 
office space in that regard: once prices and rents fall, any available floor space is usually taken 
up quickly. Indeed, vacancy rates in urban cores have already increased less sharply than urban 
out-migration would suggest. Unfortunately, the downward pressure on prices and rents is 
unlikely to make residences in superstar cities—many of which suffer from expensive housing 
and homelessness—much more affordable.

There will be 9 percent less demand for retail space in the median city we studied
Because of reduced foot traffic near urban stores during the pandemic, vacancy in retail space 
has increased and rents have declined, particularly in office-dense locations. As with office and 
residential space, vacancy rates increased from 2019 to 2022 in all the superstar urban cores we 
studied, ranging from a 1.8-percentage-point increase in San Francisco to a 6.2-percentage-
point increase in London. From 2019 to 2022, asking retail rents declined an average of  
5.4 percent (in real terms) in the cities we studied. The rents that were actually paid may have 
fallen even more.

Before price adjustments are accounted for, the demand for retail space in superstar urban cores 
that we modeled is lower in 2030 than it was in 2019, putting downward pressure on rents.6 In 
San Francisco’s urban core, for example, demand will be 17 percent lower. That estimate is what 
our model yields in a scenario in which there is a partial return to office (and therefore a partial 
recovery of retail spending near the office), people’s adoption of online shopping returns to its 
prepandemic rate of growth by 2025, and people who moved during the pandemic do not move 
back. In a more severe scenario, the decline in demand in San Francisco’s urban core would be as 
high as 26 percent. In most superstar urban cores, demand would be projected to decline even if 
the pandemic had not happened; the reasons are population trends and the increasing move to 
online shopping. As with residential real estate, however, prices are likely to adjust. 

5  Estimate excludes China because of data limitations.
6  Our model accounts for population growth, shifts toward remote work, per capita spending growth, increasing online 

spending as a share of retail spending, shifts in migration patterns, and increased shopping in the suburbs.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateWhat strongly affected neighborhoods and cities have in common

A review of various components of this research—regression analyses, survey responses, and 
literature reviews—suggests that cities where the pandemic has strongly affected real estate 
demand tend to have certain characteristics. (We were unable to determine which of those 
characteristics correlated most strongly with the impact on demand.)

Some of the characteristics are related to the business mix in a city. Specifically, cities with 
a larger share of workers in the knowledge economy, a higher number of large firms, a higher 
ratio of commuters to residents, and more cultural acceptance of remote work have tended to 
experience a greater impact on demand. Those factors lead to lower rates of office attendance, 
which reduce demand for office space directly, reduce demand for retail space by diminishing the 
number of office workers shopping at urban stores, and reduce demand for residential space by 
prompting people to move out of cities’ urban cores.

Other characteristics that correlate with the impact on demand are related to the  
urban structure of a city. Specifically, cities with office-dense real estate and little mixed-use 
development, as well as expensive housing and little green space, have tended to experience a 
greater impact on demand. Such characteristics make places less desirable for working, living, 
and shopping.

Two of those characteristics seem to correlate with the impact on demand at the neighborhood 
level as well. We examined neighborhoods defined by zip codes in Manhattan and San 
Francisco County (Exhibit E5). According to our analysis, the larger the share of real estate in a 
neighborhood that was occupied by offices, the more out-migration from that neighborhood. 
Similarly, home prices correlated with out-migration: pricier neighborhoods experienced more 
out-migration. (Data limitations prevented us from finding out whether the other characteristics 
also correlated with demand at the neighborhood level.) 

The larger the share of real  
estate in a neighborhood that  
was occupied by offices, the  
more out-migration from that 
neighborhood.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateBusiness mix and urban structure make a difference at the neighborhood level
Two very different Manhattan neighborhoods show that business mix and urban structure 
correlate with demand at the neighborhood level. The business mix of the first neighborhood, 
the Financial District, is heavily skewed toward the knowledge economy; 50 percent of all office 
space there is occupied by knowledge-economy tenants. The Financial District’s urban structure 
is office dense: 80 percent of real estate is dedicated to offices. And the average price of a home 
is roughly $1.5 million. Now consider the nearby Lower East Side, where just 22 percent of office 
space is dedicated to the knowledge economy, 7 percent of all space is dedicated to offices, and 
the average home price is about $1.0 million.

80%

Share of real estate in 
New York’s Financial 
District dedicated to

Those factors help us understand why the pandemic has driven such different outcomes in the 
two neighborhoods. The domestic out-migration rate from the start of 2020 to the start of 2022 
was 2.2 times higher in the Financial District than in the Lower East Side, for example. It stands to 
reason that residents of the Financial District could easily work from home, as the prevalence of 
the knowledge economy there suggests, and were therefore likelier to move to bigger homes far 
from their offices; meanwhile, expensive housing may have given them another reason to leave.

At the city level too, business mix and urban structure drive differences
San Francisco’s business mix helps explain the pandemic’s heavy impact there. The city has 
long cultivated a technology-focused economy with a large population of office workers, 
especially knowledge-economy workers. It has many inbound commuters, as the employment-
to-population ratio shows: that ratio, a proxy for the prevalence of commuters, is 0.87 in San 
Francisco, starkly higher than the national average of 0.48. And the city’s employers, many of 
which are in the technology industry, may have been more likely to be aware of and adopt remote 
work technology when the pandemic began. San Francisco’s urban structure also helps explain 
why the pandemic affected demand so strongly there. Home prices in San Francisco County are 
five times higher than the national average and almost twice as high as prices in the suburbs. 
Furthermore, San Francisco has limited mixed-use development: offices represent 30 percent or 
more of all real estate in nine of San Francisco’s 26 neighborhoods. 

The pandemic has affected demand less strongly in Paris than in San Francisco. Paris’s business 
mix helps show why: unlike San Francisco, which is heavily dependent on tech firms and the 
knowledge economy, Paris is home to companies that are global leaders in a wide variety of 
industries, such as beauty, hospitality, and consumer retail. But the city’s urban structure has 
features that push residents away as well as those that pull them in. On the one hand, home 
prices are twice as high in Paris’s urban core as in its suburbs and four times higher than the 
national average. On the other hand, Paris has a great deal of mixed-use development. 

Finally, consider Tokyo, where real estate demand has been affected less than in most cities we 
studied. Most of Tokyo’s workers are in wholesale and retail trade, in contrast with technology-
dependent San Francisco. Like Paris, Japan has a culture that values being present in the office, 
in particular among employees of small and medium-size businesses; in our survey, respondents 
in Tokyo said that they expected to be required to be in the office 3.7 days per week, a response 
noticeably higher than Paris’s 3.3. Loyalty to employers is also common in Japan, as are lower 
rates of technology adoption than in San Francisco. Furthermore, online spending as a share 
of retail spending was lower in Japan than in any other country we studied; that may have 
contributed to higher office attendance and continued in-person retail shopping. And in Tokyo, 
home prices in the urban core are 2.1 times higher than the national average—a starkly smaller 
number than Paris’s 4.1 and San Francisco’s 5.0.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateThriving in hybrid places

Superstar cities are facing a new reality in which hybrid work worsens vacancy rates, threatens 
the vibrancy of neighborhoods, and thus makes urban cores less attractive to employers, 
employees, and residents. To adapt to that new reality, urban stakeholders could consider 
adopting more hybrid approaches themselves. At the neighborhood and building levels, and even 
in the design of the floors of buildings, choosing diversity, adaptability, and flexibility rather than 
homogeneity can help cities thrive. 

At the neighborhood level, consider mixed-use development
One way cities could adapt is through mixed-use neighborhoods—that is, neighborhoods that are 
not dominated by a single type of real estate (especially offices) but instead incorporate a diverse 
mix of office, residential, and retail space. Such hybrid neighborhoods were becoming more 
popular even before the pandemic. And now that the pandemic has reduced demand for offices, 
cities have been left with vacant space that could be converted to other uses. Furthermore, our 
research shows that mixed-use neighborhoods have suffered less during the pandemic than 
office-dense neighborhoods have. That resilience gives investors, developers, and cities still 
more reason to engage in placemaking. 

Redeveloping neighborhoods is an enormous undertaking, of course, so mobilizing the many 
stakeholders is important. Governments may be particularly helpful in reforming restrictive 
zoning policies. Investors would be needed to finance redevelopment. And developers would be 
the ones to turn mixed-use visions into realities.

Suburbs can benefit from hybridity as well. City dwellers, untethered from their daily commutes 
and thus less concerned about living far from urban cores, are increasingly seeking larger homes 
in greener areas. More housing and retail in the suburbs could help satisfy their preferences. 
More multifamily housing could be particularly beneficial because it would accommodate more 
people than single-family homes do. So long as the apartments are larger and more comfortable 
than apartments in urban cores, they could attract urbanites seeking space. Suburban policy 
makers could consider encouraging multifamily development by adjusting zoning, offering 
incentives to developers, and reexamining regulations that prevent housing from being built, 
such as those governing minimum dwelling sizes and window requirements. 

Redeveloping neighborhoods is 
an enormous undertaking, of 
course, so mobilizing the many 
stakeholders is important. 

13

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateFurthermore, multifamily housing is more energy-efficient than single-family homes, so it could 
help push down carbon emissions. And because it accommodates many people, it could help 
alleviate the shortage of housing that many metropolitan areas suffer from, making living in those 
areas more affordable.

At the building level, construct space that is adaptable and flexible
To adapt to declining demand for traditional office and retail space, developers could create 
hybrid buildings. The most ambitious vision is a universal, “neutral-use” building whose design, 
infrastructure, and technology could be easily modified to serve different uses. Imagine a 
medical building that could be easily converted into, say, a hotel or an apartment building if 
customers’ preferences changed. More modestly, buildings could be designed to accommodate 
different degrees of collaborative and individual work or different arrangements of open and 
closed offices. They could also include technology that promotes flexibility, such as sensors to 
track patterns of usage that could inform an employer’s approach to hybrid work.

Hybrid buildings would bring at least two advantages. One is that they would protect owners from 
shifts in preferences that are impossible to predict now. The second relates to a current trend 
toward shorter leases in the office sector. Because tenants will now be moving in and out more 
frequently, buildings might become more valuable if they grow more adaptable.

Developers could also try to convert offices into the kinds of space for which there is more 
demand, such as apartments, hotels, and schools. Conversions are very hard, however. 
Obstacles include rezoning, renegotiating existing lease commitments to allow for renovations, 
and dealing with physical limitations. Furthermore, in the cities we studied, even if all excess 
office space were converted into housing, the amount of residential space in each city would 
grow by less than 3 percent.7 Still, for owners facing the prospect of lower occupancy and lower 
rents in their office buildings, the opportunity cost of conversion has fallen, and the number of 
successful conversions may grow. 

Turning empty spaces into hybrid 
places could be a way to transform 
superstar cities and prepare them 
for a dynamic, prosperous future.

7  Excess office space means space projected to be vacant beyond what would result from the structural vacancy rate  

(defined as the average vacancy rate from 2014 to 2019).

14

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateDevelopers of retail space too could keep adaptability in mind. Of late, retail tenants have been 
evaluating their footprints with a stricter eye, shutting down stores or moving into smaller spaces. 
If developers built more adaptable spaces, they would be likelier to remain relevant to tenants’ 
shifting needs. Developers might also offer new store formats, such as spaces intended for 
delivery and fulfillment or for logistics rather than traditional retail. Or they might design buildings 
that are more integrated with their environments—for example, with dining spaces that extend 
onto sidewalks.

At the floor level, design space that is modular and multiuse 
Tenants in urban cores—both the employers who rent office space and the merchants who rent 
retail space—may have to start “earning the commute” from office workers and shoppers who 
would otherwise visit less often. Here too, thinking flexibly and adaptably can help. For example, 
the office does not have to be just a place to work; it can also be a place where employees 
genuinely enjoy spending time or where they can take part in compelling events and activities. 
Office tenants might try to attract them by building magnetic, hospitality-oriented workplaces. 
Office tenants might also design more modular spaces that can adapt to changes in work 
patterns from week to week. And the most forward-thinking tenants will provide an efficient, 
digital way to organize hybrid work patterns and preferences.

Retailers too may have to “earn the commute” by designing spaces that cater to many different 
uses. A prime example is stores that easily accommodate omnichannel retail—a single, seamless 
experience for customers, whether they shop online or in person. Similarly, stores can provide 
experiential retail. For example, one department store brand is launching smaller stores where 
customers can pick up products bought online, get clothes altered, find style advice, and 
patronize a beauty salon. 

Indeed, it is not hard to imagine more “hybrid floors” in which offices, residences, and stores exist 
side by side. For floors—as for buildings and neighborhoods—turning empty spaces into hybrid 
places may not simply be a way to counter the damage wrought by the pandemic. It could be a 
way to transform superstar cities and prepare them for a dynamic, prosperous future.

1.  How hybrid work 
has changed the 
way people work, 
live, and shop

When the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, daily life changed for billions of people in 
countless ways. The most important, from the perspective of real estate in superstar cities, was a 
sudden and massive shift to remote work, a change that was enabled by widespread adoption of 
videoconferencing and file-sharing technology. In the blink of an eye, millions of employees were 
working not at their offices downtown but from their bedrooms and couches.

That shift affected their behavior in three main ways. First, of course, it changed where they 
worked. Second, it changed where they lived; untethered from their daily commutes, many of 
them moved away from urban cores. Third, it changed where they shopped, as online shopping 
and stores near home became more attractive than urban establishments. Those three 
behavioral changes, in turn, affected the three classes of real estate—office, residential, and 
retail—that we discuss in the next chapter.

The three changes were not all permanent, but they have left cities permanently altered. In this 
chapter, we examine them in detail. Our research suggests that remote work will continue, that 
accelerated urban out-migration is slowing but not reversing, and that shopping in cities will 
remain weaker than it used to be.

Hybrid work is here to stay

After abandoning their offices at the start of the pandemic, employees are now working there 
more often—though still far less than they used to. Office attendance varies by city; for example, 
it tends to be lower in cities with expensive housing and a large share of knowledge-economy 
workers. It also varies by industry and workers’ demographic characteristics. There are several 
reasons to think that office attendance has stabilized and will continue at current rates.

Office attendance is still 30 percent lower than it was before the pandemic
In early 2020, office attendance plummeted for workers in superstar cities. Lockdowns, 
office closures, and uncomfortable masks gave them a reason to work remotely, and existing 
technology gave them the means. Office attendance fell by 90 percent in New York City and  
San Francisco.8 The drops in Austin, Dallas, Houston, and Los Angeles were less severe but still 
stark at about 70 percent.

17

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateThree years later, remote work has given way to hybrid work (a combination of in-office 
and remote work), and office attendance has rebounded substantially. But as of fall 2022, 
workers were going to the office an average of just 3.5 days per week, some 30 percent below 
prepandemic norms, according to our survey. (For more information about the survey, see the 
technical appendix.) 

Of all the survey respondents, 37 percent go to the office every day (Exhibit 1). An additional  
56 percent have hybrid work arrangements and thus spend one to four days per week in the 
office. And 7 percent work fully remotely.

of knowledge-economy workers
Office attendance varies among metropolitan areas. Employees in Beijing, for example, go to 
the office 3.9 days per week, on average, while those in London go just 3.1 days per week. The 
other metropolitan areas we studied ranked between those extremes and were mostly clustered 
around 3.3 to 3.6 days in the office. Similarly, the percentage of workers who do not work from 
home at all varies by country. In Japan, more than half of all office workers spend five days per 
week in the office. In the United Kingdom, just 28 percent do. 

Two urban characteristics seem to matter most in determining office attendance in a 
metropolitan area: its proportion of knowledge-economy workers and its housing costs  
(Exhibit 2). According to our regression analysis of US counties, the higher a county’s ratio of 
knowledge-economy workers to other workers, the lower its average office attendance.  
(We define the knowledge economy as the professional services, information technology, and 
finance industries.) Similarly, the higher home prices are in an urban core relative to its suburbs, 
the lower the metro area’s average office attendance is (see Box E1, “How we define cities,”  
in the executive summary). Other characteristics of US counties with lower office attendance, 
according to our analysis, are a larger share of commuters and a smaller share of retail 
employees (which suggests a more limited retail presence). It seems reasonable to think that 
those relationships would also exist in superstar cities elsewhere in the world, but we were not 
able to confirm that.

Culture and government policy also play a role in office attendance. For example, Chinese cities’ 
high rates of office attendance today can probably be explained by the widespread “996” office 
culture (for “9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the office, six days a week”). And Beijing’s and Shanghai’s citywide 
lockdowns reduced office attendance to near zero when they were in effect.

Employees at larger firms report significantly lower office attendance than do those at smaller 
firms (Exhibit 3). For example, at firms with 1,000 to 9,999 employees, workers go to the office 
3.3 days per week, on average; at firms with 50 to 99 employees, attendance averages 3.7 days. 
One potential reason is that larger companies tend to have more resources and technology to 
support working from home. Another is that the sense of community may be stronger at smaller 
companies, prompting more employees to visit the office. 

Also, client meetings are less of a reason to come to the office for employees at larger 
companies than for those at smaller ones. At companies with 1,000 to 24,999 employees,  
25 percent of survey respondents ranked meeting with clients as one of the top three reasons 
to come to the office, whereas at companies with fewer than 100 employees, 32 percent did.  
A similar pattern exists for employees in client-facing roles: among salespeople at companies 
with 1,000 to 24,999 employees, 42 percent go to the office five days per week, a share that 
grows to 54 percent at companies with 2 to 99 employees.

And employees in the knowledge economy go to the office 0.2 fewer days per week than do 
those in other industries. One reason could be that knowledge-economy industries are highly 
digitized and therefore amenable to remote work. Another could be that employees in those

Even though 
their commutes are no longer than those of other workers, they were much likelier than other 
workers to call saving commuting time one of their top three reasons for working from home.

Office attendance varies in subtle ways by age, income, and seniority 
The average number of days that respondents work in the office does not vary much by age, 
income, or seniority (Exhibit 4, left side). For example, millennials reported working 3.4 days per 
week in the office, and members of Generation X and baby boomers reported 3.5. The starkest 
variation we found was among millennials in senior positions, who go to the office 3.7 days per 
week, more than any other group we studied.

However, there are some differences in the likelihood of those groups to go to the office a 
particular number of days per week (Exhibit 4, right side). Two differences in particular stand out. 
First, baby boomers are much likelier to go to the office five days per week than younger workers

Second, junior-level workers are much likelier to go to the office five days per week than 
midlevel and senior employees are; perhaps counterintuitively, they are also more likely to work 
entirely remotely, never going to the office at all.

Furthermore, cluster analysis of respondents in the United States reveals statistically significant 
groups among those who mostly go to the office and those who mostly work from home. There 
are two such groups among people who mostly go to the office: high-earning male C-suite 
employees and low-earning female junior employees. There are also two such groups among 
people who mostly work from home: knowledge-economy workers who earn over $200,000 per 
year and, again, low-earning female junior employees.

Employees work from home to save commuting time, and they work from the office to see 
their teams 
When we asked survey respondents who were able to work from home what their top reason was 
for doing so, the most popular answer globally, as we expected, was to save commuting time, 
followed by increasing productivity and saving money (Exhibit 5). The answers varied by country, 
however. For example, 38 percent of respondents in Japan cited saving commuting time as their 
top reason, whereas just 11 percent of those in China said the same. Saving money was the top 
reason for 11 to 15 percent of respondents in Europe but for just 3 percent of those in Japan. In all 
countries, however, respondents called increasing productivity one of the top reasons. 

The most popular reasons given by workers with flexible work arrangements for choosing to 
come to the office were to be able to work with their teams, to comply with an employer’s policy, 
and to increase productivity. (The fact that increasing productivity was cited as a top reason 
for both going to the office and working from home suggests that where employees feel most 
productive may differ by individual or task.) Those findings were substantially consistent in 
France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In China and Japan, however, few 
respondents cited an employer’s policy as their top reason for going to the office.

The current rate of office attendance may persist
Three indicators suggest that the current rate of office attendance may have stabilized. First, 
in ten of the most populous cities in the United States, office attendance has held roughly 
steady since mid-2022, aside from a normal seasonal dip around the winter holidays (Exhibit 
6).9 Second, three numbers—the number of days per week that survey respondents go to the 
office, the number of days that they expect to go to the office after the pandemic ends, and their

remotely. About 10 percent of respondents worldwide said that they were both likely to quit 
their jobs if required to work at the office every day and willing to trade more than 20 percent 
of their compensation to work their preferred number of days from home. That group is 
comparatively senior and well paid; 44 percent of them are in senior roles, and 33 percent  
of them earn more than $150,000 per year (Exhibit 8). Their seniority and high incomes 
suggest that they are probably decision makers who can protect remote work at the team or 
company level.  

Nevertheless, it is not certain that office attendance will stay at its current level. For example, 
employees might gain bargaining power and reduce the number of days they work in the 
office, or employers might gain bargaining power (in the event of a recession, for example) and 
increase that number. Improvements in hybrid work technology and processes could make it 
less necessary to come to the office. 

Office attendance could also rise if employers find ways to attract workers back to the office. 
As pandemic restrictions loosened, employers often offered perks, such as free meals and 
in-office recreational areas, to encourage employees to return. But that approach appears to 
have succeeded only on a very limited scale; just 3 percent of respondents who were able to 
choose where to work called such perks their top reason for going to the office. 

In the long run, what chiefly determines the rate of office attendance will be its impact on 
productivity. If research conclusively indicates either a negative or a positive relationship 
between hybrid work and productivity, that could push office attendance up or down, 
respectively. Studies conducted by companies and research institutions have so far shown  
no negative relationship between hybrid work and productivity.10 For example, a previous MGI 
report found that about 20 to 25 percent of the workforces in advanced economies could work 
from home between three and five days a week without a loss of productivity.11 Employees 
themselves seem to believe that hybrid work helps productivity; in our survey, 87 percent of 
survey respondents indicated that they would be more productive if they worked their desired 
number of days at home than if they had to work at the office five days per week. 

Up to 7 percent of the people in urban cores left for good

For more than 20 years, superstar cities were the center of global growth. Just 1 percent of the 
Earth’s surface was home to more than 50 percent of global GDP growth and population growth 
from 2000 to 2019.12 The two types of growth reinforced each other: “agglomeration economies” 
fueled economic and productivity growth in these cities, resulting in high-income jobs that 
attracted still more people.13 They came even though housing tended to be expensive—especially 
in superstar cities where the supply of housing was very constrained, such as San Francisco.

Then the pandemic began, prompting a wave of households to leave superstar cities and thus 
driving down population (Exhibit 9). Munich’s population grew by 1.0 percent per year from 2014 
to 2019, for instance, but it grew by only 0.3 percent per year from 2020 to 2022. In Boston, 
population growth during the first period turned into population decline during the second. Urban 
cores were particularly affected. For example, New York City’s urban core lost 5 percent of its 
population from mid-2020 to mid-2022, and San Francisco’s lost 7 percent. One reason for the 
surge of out-migration was hybrid work. Now that people were not working at the office, they cared 
less about living nearby and could instead prioritize better housing conditions. 

Out-migration has since declined, but it has neither ended nor reversed, and it seems to remain 
higher than it was before the pandemic began. That is, the people who left the urban cores are 
not coming back, and many others are still leaving. 

During the pandemic, a wave of households in superstar cities moved from the urban cores 
to the suburbs, a trend that was strongest in the United States
In all but two of the superstar cities we studied, after the pandemic began, the difference 
between urban and suburban population growth shifted to the suburbs’ advantage

The difference between urban and 
suburban population growth was largest in London, Dallas, Houston, New York City, and San 
Francisco. In most US cities, suburbanization had already been happening and was simply 
accelerated by the pandemic. By contrast, all the European cities that we studied except Paris 
and Munich had been urbanizing before the pandemic, so the suburbanization represented a 
reversal. The Japanese cities had also been growing more urban before the pandemic, but there, 
the trend continued even after the pandemic started.

14  Those two cities are Beijing and Munich. The time in question is the 2020–22 period, except for Beijing, London, and 

Shanghai, where data about population changes in 2022 were not available; for those cities, we studied the 2020–21 period. 
Also, the month in which the 2020–22 period begins differs from country to country. For example, for the United States, the 
period begins in July 2020 and ends in July 2022, but for France, it begins in January 2020 and ends in January 2022.

27

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estatePopulation trends in Beijing were very different from those in other cities. For years before the 
pandemic, the government had relocated Beijing’s residents to suburban areas. During the 
pandemic, however, it imposed policies restricting movement; as a result, population growth in 
Beijing’s urban core nearly matched that in its suburbs.15 

The suburbanization effect may have been stronger in US superstar cities than in European 
and Japanese ones because the urban cores of US superstar cities tend to be office-dense 
and retail-poor, whereas the European and Japanese urban cores tend to follow a mixed-use 
model in which office, residential, and retail space exist alongside one another. Supporting that 
contention is our statistical analysis of US counties, which indicates that those experiencing 
the highest rates of out-migration during the pandemic tended to have four characteristics: 
expensive homes, high office density, a high share of workers in the knowledge economy, and a 
low share of workers in retail, which suggests a more limited retail presence (Exhibit 11).16 

The same patterns held true at the zip code level during the pandemic. When we conducted an 
analysis of neighborhoods in San Francisco County, New York County (Manhattan), and Harris 
County (which is mostly Houston), we found that people moved out of expensive, office-dense zip 
codes and into cheaper ones with more mixed use of real estate. 

The urban cores of US superstar 
cities tend to be office-dense and 
retail-poor, whereas the European 
and Japanese urban cores tend to 
follow a mixed-use model.

15  In 2020, domestic migration declined by 40 percent in 369 Chinese cities. See Debin Lu et al., “Spatiotemporal patterns and 
influencing factors of human migration networks in China during COVID-19,” Geography and Sustainability, volume 2, issue 4, 
December 2021.

16  Specifically, we studied about 130 counties in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, 

Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC, metropolitan areas. As a proxy for home price, we used the Zillow 
Home Value Index at the county level; to measure office density, we used employment as a share of population.

To learn more about why people left urban cores during the pandemic, we identified survey 
respondents who had moved after March 2020 for pandemic-related reasons. They represented 
the majority of all respondents who had moved after March 2020 (Exhibit 12). Roughly a third of 
them said that their moves would not have been possible without remote work. 

Pandemic-related out-migration after March 2020 was led by young households, and in 
particular by young people who had caregiving responsibilities and who valued remote work. 
Respondents who moved because of the pandemic were younger than those who did not move 
(averaging 36 years of age as opposed to 43); were more prone to say that they were “likely” 
or “extremely likely” to quit their jobs if forced to go to the office five days a week (39 percent 
versus 26 percent); were likelier to be caregivers (59 percent versus 44 percent); and had bigger 
households, on average (3.1 people versus 2.9). 

Many of these moves happened because employees untethered from their daily commutes 
began to care less about how far they lived from the office. Of all survey respondents who went 
to the office less than five days per week, 38 percent said that remote work had made them more 
willing to live farther from the office. In the United States, 55 percent of respondents who moved 
during the pandemic went to places that were farther from the office than their previous homes 
had been, while just 33 percent moved closer.

Out-migration from superstar cities’ urban cores seems to have slowed of late. Between 2020 
and 2021, 0.32 percent of the US population left superstar urban cores; the following year, that 
share fell to 0.24 percent (Exhibit 13).17 But that loss is still larger than it was before the pandemic. 
In other words, the people who moved out during the pandemic are not moving back, at least not 
yet. The main beneficiaries of out-migration seem to be rural and suburban areas near  
non-superstar cities. 

Our survey suggests that the people who left urban cores in other countries are not coming back 
either. In China, 41 percent of pandemic-related movers said that they might move back, but that 
share was less than a quarter in France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Pandemic-
related movers’ strong preference for hybrid work—and their professed willingness to quit their 
jobs if denied it—also implies that they are unlikely to move back.

Just as the shift to hybrid work has changed people’s residential preferences, it has changed 
their shopping preferences. During the height of the pandemic, foot traffic near brick-and-
mortar stores plummeted, especially in urban cores. The office workers who used to sustain 
those stores shopped there far less, shifting their purchases to the internet and to stores near 
their homes in the suburbs. More recently, foot traffic near urban stores has risen again, but it 
remains lower than it was before the pandemic, spelling problems for retailers. 

As people stayed home during the pandemic, they radically changed the way they shopped
In March and April 2020, as the pandemic began, foot traffic near stores plummeted in the 
superstar cities we studied (Exhibit 14).18 The declines were starkest in London and Paris, 
where it fell by about 80 percent. In New York City and San Francisco, it fell by 50 to 60 percent 
during the same period, while in Houston and Tokyo, it declined by only about 30 percent. The 
different outcomes may have been due to variations in government policies, degrees of tourism, 
acceptance of remote work, and other cultural norms. For example, the strict lockdowns that 
London and Paris imposed in March may have contributed to those cities’ precipitous declines.

One trend that helped consumers visit stores less often was a quickening shift to online shopping 
(Exhibit 15). Online spending as a share of all retail spending had already been growing; in the 
three years before the pandemic, that share grew by 0.4 percentage point per year in Japan and 
by 2.2 percentage points per year in China, for example. But then the pandemic began, and the 
share spiked from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020. The spike occurred in all the countries we 
studied; it was smallest in Japan (1.3 percentage points) and largest in China (9.9 percentage 
points). The pandemic effectively accelerated the use of online spending by three to four years. 

An interesting fact is that the countries seeing the sharpest increases, China and the United 
Kingdom, were the ones where online spending represented the largest share of all retail 
spending before the pandemic. Perhaps those countries were the most primed for e-commerce 
growth—with greater customer awareness, more mature distribution, and more adept  
retailers—and were therefore best able to meet the surge in demand during the pandemic.

202020160403020102019McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateShopping behavior has started to return to prepandemic trends, yet foot traffic and 
purchasing in stores remain lower 
Although it spiked during the first year of the pandemic, online spending as a share of retail 
spending is now at the same level that it would have reached by now if the pandemic had not 
happened. It has done that either by growing more slowly (as in France and Germany) or by 
shrinking (as in China and the United States), though of course it remains higher everywhere than 
it was before the pandemic. 

Yet foot traffic near stores remains down. As of October 2022, it appeared to have stabilized at a 
level 10 to 20 percent lower than the prepandemic level in the metropolitan areas we studied. 

Spending in stores also remains down, though not as much as foot traffic (Exhibit 16). In most 
metropolitan areas, it was estimated to be as much as 10 percent lower in 2022 than it had 
been in 2019 in real terms—though in Beijing, where lockdowns remained in force through most 
of 2022, it was far lower. Although this is bad news for stores, at least the decline in spending 
has not been as steep as the decline in foot traffic: shoppers have consolidated trips, making 
purchases more frequently when they do visit stores and spending more per trip.

The pandemic led consumers to spend more on goods, but since 2021, 
they have been shifting their spending to services.

And though consumers famously shifted their spending from services to goods during the 
pandemic, they have been slowly shifting it back to services since mid-2021. In the United States, 
for instance, spending on goods has stabilized since the end of 2021, but spending on services 
has continued to grow past prepandemic levels in real terms (Exhibit 17). In France, spending on 
services grew in 2021 in real terms; in 2022, it grew again, even as spending on goods fell. 

Those trends will pose challenges for brick-and-mortar stores’ sales. The upward march of online 
sales will eat away at the stores’ revenues, even though that march has slowed since 2020. Lost 
foot traffic will do the same unless stores find ways to improve their marketing or encourage the 
customers who do visit to make more and larger purchases. (The most successful retailers are 
rethinking their store formats to support omnichannel experiences—those in which customers’ 
in-store and online experiences, including the marketing aimed at them, are integrated.) The 
spending shift from goods back to services may further reduce foot traffic to stores selling 
goods. And other trends could further complicate stores’ prospects. For example, “revenge 
spending,” consumers’ tendency to spend heavily after the pandemic to make up for lost time, 
will dissipate, or economies around the world could enter recessions.

office-dense neighborhoods
Retailers in urban cores confront even greater challenges. As of October 2022, foot traffic had 
recovered noticeably less near those stores than near suburban ones (Exhibit 18). In New York, 
for example, foot traffic near suburban stores was 16 percent lower than it had been in January 
2020, but foot traffic near urban stores was 36 percent lower.

And retail traffic has been still lower in cities’ office-dense neighborhoods. For example, the City 
of London, the borough in London with the highest ratio of office jobs to residents, experienced 
a nearly 50 percent decrease in foot traffic near stores from February 2020 to June 2022—by 
far the most severe and sustained decline of any borough in London. Foot traffic near stores 
was also hurt by declines in tourism, but more mildly; in London, boroughs that are popular with 
tourists, such as Kensington and Westminster, fared much better than the City of London.

than in urban cores.

Part of the reason for office-dense neighborhoods’ declines in foot traffic seems to be that many 
of the employees who might shop there spend more time working from home than they used to. 
In our survey, respondents in the United States who worked at the office no more than one day 
per week reported doing much less of their total retail spending near the office than those who 
worked in the office for two to five days a week reported (Exhibit 19).

However, the struggles of stores in urban cores may present opportunities for those in the 
suburbs. The same survey respondents—those who spent less at stores near the office—also 
spent more at stores near home.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estate2.  The impact on 

real estate

The pandemic had major effects on office workers in superstar cities, as the previous chapter 
described. Above all, the pandemic changed their working habits, encouraging many employees 
to work from home instead of in the office. As they abandoned offices in urban cores, they also 
started moving to the suburbs in search of larger homes in greener areas. And they shopped less 
at stores near the office and more online.

Those three changes could have equally significant effects on demand for office, residential, 
and retail real estate. To find out how large those effects might be, we built a model that 
projects demand for office, residential, and retail space in a number of scenarios, including a 
moderate one and a severe one. The model used information from the large global survey that 
we conducted. We also considered a wide variety of factors, including long-term population 
trends; employment trends, such as the ongoing effects of automation on employment; office 
attendance patterns by industry; employee coordination, defined as the maximum share of 
workers in the office at a given time that employers need to maintain; workers’ ages and incomes; 
the share of a city’s population that commutes from elsewhere; housing prices; and shopping 
trends, such as the ongoing increase in online shopping. 

In the scenarios that we modeled, demand for office and retail space is generally lower in 
2030 than it was in 2019, but the reductions are smaller than those projected by many other 
researchers. Residential space is less affected, though the price differences between urban 
cores and suburbs are narrower than they used to be. (For more about the modeling methods and 
differences among the scenarios, see the technical appendix.)

There will be less demand for office space

Demand for office space in superstar cities has been falling since the start of the pandemic as a 
result of lower office attendance. Our model suggests that the problem will only worsen over the 
next seven years, at least in most of the cities we studied.

Demand for office space has already fallen, and vacancy rates have grown by as much as  
13 percent in the cities we studied
Since the start of the pandemic, lower office attendance has driven demand for office 
space down and vacancy rates up. In every city we studied, the percentage of office space 
that was vacant rose from 2019 to 2022 (Exhibit 20). The increase ranged from two to 
13 percentage points, depending on the city. Moreover, the size of the increase in the cities we 
studied correlated with the degree to which office attendance there fell, showing that the two 
phenomena were related. For example, in San Francisco, which experienced one of the steepest 
declines in office attendance in our study, office vacancy was more than ten percentage points 
higher in 2022 than it was in 2019. That change was the largest of the vacancy-rate increases 
we observed and seven percentage points higher than the national average. It was also a stark 
reversal of prepandemic conditions: San Francisco was the tightest US market in 2019, when just 
6 percent of its office space was vacant (four percentage points below the national average).

In most superstar cities, lower office attendance has similarly driven down asking rents in real 
terms.19 Rents in the US cities we studied fell especially sharply—for example, by 28 percent in 
San Francisco and by 18 percent in New York City from 2019 to 2022. Rents in the European 
cities we studied have been more resilient. In Paris, London, and Munich, they fell by 10 percent, 
12 percent, and 9 percent, respectively. In only two of the cities we studied, Munich and  
Tokyo, did rents actually increase; they grew the most in Tokyo, increasing by 4 percent from 
2019 to 2022. 

Occupancy and rents may fall further still. Because their employees are coming to the office less 
often, many employers have downsized spaces to reduce costs. More will do so; thanks to the 
lengthy nature of leases in the office sector, nearly half of all tenants have not made a renewal 
decision since the onset of the pandemic, and macroeconomic uncertainty could give them 
further reasons to downsize. Indeed, some tenants have chosen not to wait for their renewal 
dates and instead have bought their way out of long-term contracts. Some landlords have 
offered tenants rent abatements and higher tenant improvement allowances (capital for physical 
improvements or alterations), but those actions, while they may have propped up occupancy, 
have reduced effective rent. And though office attendance seems to be stabilizing, tenants may 
remain hesitant to commit to new long-term leases, unsure of how much space they will need in a 
few years. 

19  To determine rent changes in real terms, we adjusted rents for inflation in the country where each city was located.

40

0201052515McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateThere is historical precedent for rents’ falling further than they have so far. During the global 
financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, and also when the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, 
asking rents in London, New York City, and San Francisco fell by more than 30 percent. They 
dropped by 21 percent, on average, from their peak in the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth 
quarter of 2022.

The decline in demand has allowed tenants—wary about current macroeconomic conditions, 
uncertain about how much their workers will come to the office, and therefore uncertain about 
how much space they will need—to negotiate shorter leases from owners. Shorter leases, in turn, 
may make it more difficult for owners to obtain financing or may cause banks to adjust valuation 
models, which rely in part on the duration of existing leases.

Also, because of uncertainty about demand, transaction volume—the dollar value of all sales of 
office buildings—has fallen dramatically. The difference between the prices requested by owners 
and the bids placed by potential buyers remains wide, financing costs are higher than they were 
during a frenzied trading environment in 2021, and debt availability remains depressed.20 In 2022, 
global volume fell in each consecutive quarter, and the total for the year was nearly 28 percent 
lower than it was in 2019. At the city level, transaction volumes have broadly correlated with sale 
prices. For example, transaction volume in New York City was 36 percent lower in 2022 than in 
2019, and the average sale price per square foot fell 13 percent over the same period. Conversely, 
transaction volume in Atlanta was 31 percent higher in 2022 than in 2019, and price per square 
foot grew by 37 percent over the same period.21 

Current owners of office buildings hope for a return to prepandemic levels of net operating 
income. But potential buyers may not share that hope, according to a common indicator of the 
market outlook for assets. Capitalization rates, which equal properties’ net operating income 
divided by their current value, have been rising, and that is typically a sign of lower future 
valuations. In the fourth quarter of 2022, total returns for the office sector in one index were 
−4.80 percent, distinctly lower than the −3.50 percent returns for all asset classes.22 

Demand for office space in the median city we studied is projected to be 13 percent lower in 
2030 than in 2019
According to our model, demand for office space in a moderate scenario will be 13 percent 
lower in 2030 than it was in 2019 for the median superstar city in our study. Remote work and 
flexible working arrangements drive that projected decline by reducing office attendance. Also, 
the amount of space allocated to each office worker is expected to shrink as pandemic-related 
concerns wane, further reducing demand. However, population growth may partly or fully offset 
the expected demand decline in some cities. (Our model does not consider price elasticity; that 
is, it does not account for the fact that when demand decreases, prices fall, pushing demand 
partway back up.)

In the scenarios we modeled, demand declines most precipitously in San Francisco (Exhibit 21). 
One reason is that before the pandemic, the share of employees who were office-based in  
San Francisco was among the highest in the United States, so office attendance there fell 
unusually sharply. Furthermore, San Francisco had an unusually large share of workers in 
technology and professional services, who were among the most able to work from home at 
the start of the pandemic and have subsequently been among those who go to the office least 
frequently. On their own, those pandemic-driven changes would push down demand for office 
space in 2030 by 23 percent in the moderate scenario. But population and office employment 
growth will push demand up and slightly offset that effect so that the net decline in demand is  
20 percent.

20  In 2021, global office trading volume grew 27 percent each quarter and commercial real estate trading volume grew 38 percent 

each quarter.

Houston, by contrast, shows the strongest future demand for office space among cities in our 
study. In the moderate scenario, such demand is projected to grow by 2 percent between 2019 
and 2030. That growth is partly owing to Houston’s high office attendance; pandemic-driven 
changes in people’s working behavior are thus projected to reduce demand for office space in 
Houston by just 10 percent, a smaller drop than in some other cities. But it is also owing to strong 
population growth. Houston has long benefited from a broader trend of migration to US Sunbelt 
cities, and that trend, by pushing up total office employment, should boost demand by a powerful 
13 percent, more than offsetting the pandemic-driven changes.

42

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateOur model also estimates a severe scenario for office-space demand, one in which office 
attendance remains at current levels indefinitely and out-migration from urban cores is higher.  
In that scenario too, San Francisco fares worst among the cities we studied and Houston best.  
In San Francisco, demand for office space would be 38 percent lower in 2030 than it was in 2019. 
In Houston, demand would be 10 percent lower. 

The demand shortfall that we project, along with growing supply resulting from the completion of 
new office buildings, will boost vacancy rates. In 2030, in the superstar cities we studied, there will 
be excess supply of office space of 7 to 21 percent, according to our model’s moderate scenario 
(Exhibit 22). We define excess supply as the percentage of office space that is vacant beyond 
structural vacancy (the average from 2014 to 2019). In essence, it represents the part of projected 
vacancies attributable to the pandemic. It will be at least 15 percent in more than half the cities we 
studied and be particularly high in San Francisco, Shanghai, Beijing, London, and Munich. 

Excess supply is caused by two factors: decreasing demand for office space (discussed above) 
and continued supply growth (that is, new office buildings entering the market). For example, 
in Houston, excess supply is projected to be low (7 percent) because, although supply growth 
will be about as high as in several other cities, demand is actually expected to grow, thanks to 
employment growth and in-migration. By contrast, excess supply will be 20 percent in Shanghai, 
driven by a relatively severe decline in demand and relatively high supply growth.

It will be more than 20 percent in all cities except Tokyo and Munich in 2030. Tokyo’s projected 
vacancy rate, 13 percent, is the lowest in our study, which may be due to Tokyo’s transit-oriented 
design and general resiliency against the pandemic’s effects.

Excess supply can be reduced in only two ways: boosting demand (say, by attracting companies 
and jobs to fill vacant spaces) or shrinking supply (by demolishing office buildings or converting 
them to other uses). We discuss those possibilities in chapter 4. 

In the cities we studied, $800 billion in office-space value is at stake
In the nine cities we studied, a total of $800 billion in office-space value (in real terms) is at 
stake by 2030 in the moderate scenario. On average, the total value of office space declines by 
26 percent in the moderate scenario and by 42 percent in the severe one from 2019 to 2030. 
The impact on value could be even greater if rising interest rates compound it. Similarly, the 
impact could increase if troubled financial institutions decide to more quickly reduce the price of 
property they finance or own.

Although other factors could drive a decline in value, our model uses only the impact of changing 
demand. We assume in both scenarios that market capitalization rates will remain constant from 
2022 onward. In the moderate scenario, we assume that rents will remain constant in real terms 
from 2022 through 2030. In the severe scenario, by contrast, we assume that rents will be  
30 percent lower in 2025 than they were in 2019 and then remain constant in real terms  
until 2030.23 

The decline in value is already occurring: capitalization rates for office space in the United States 
have risen from 5.8 percent to 8.0 percent over the past three years, implying value erosion of 
more than 35 percent before accounting for net operating income decline.24 In the worst case, 
falling property values could lead to a “doom loop” for some buildings. A doom loop begins when 
a building’s value declines and its owner consequently holds less equity in relation to debt. That 
shifting capital structure makes it harder for the owner to secure financing. As a result, aging and 
low-quality properties may remain unrenovated or not repurposed, further reducing property 
values. That phenomenon could be exacerbated by office tenants’ increased preference for 
higher-quality spaces (see Box 1, “The ‘flight to quality’ in office space”).

A ‘doom loop’ could be 
exacerbated by office tenants’ 
increased preference for  
higher-quality spaces.

23  Also, our model used five-year rolling average rents to calculate value in order to account for traditionally long lease terms. 
However, tenants have started to opt for shorter and more flexible leases, both because they are uncertain about their 
workers’ behavior and because providers of flexible office space have emerged, offering tenants more choices. Shorter leases 
without a commensurate rent premium can impair value, as an astute investor will pay less for lower certainty in cash flows.  
So if shorter leases become the norm, the value destruction that we have calculated may prove to be an underestimate.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateBox 1
The ‘flight to quality’ in office space

The decline in demand for office space has been accompanied 
by a shift in tenants’ preferences toward high-quality space. 
From 2020 to 2022, rents and demand for Class A space grew 
more quickly than those for Class B space in many major US 
cities (Exhibit 23). 

While many tenants are downsizing to save money, others are 
paying more per square foot to provide attractive space to their 
employees. Some are doing both: a large professional services 
firm recently consolidated its footprint in New York City, closing 
two older spaces covering 800,000 square feet and setting up a 
new space in 450,000 square feet of top-quality space.

There are a number of reasons for this “flight to quality.” One 
is that older office space is often not suited to hybrid work; for 
example, it may have less sophisticated audiovisual equipment. 
Also, now that hybrid work has reduced the total amount of 

space that employers need, they can spend their budgets on 
smaller amounts of higher-quality space rather than larger 
amounts of lower-quality space. The main reason, though, 
is that many employers see high-quality space as a way to 
encourage office attendance among their employees. (Among 
other things, Class A buildings tend to be near transit and thus 
can reduce commuting time.) 

The survey described in chapter 1 provides some evidence that 
the strategy could be successful. Among the respondents who 
said that they would be willing to trade more than 20 percent 
of their income to work their desired number of days in the 
office rather than go every day, one of the top reasons given for 
sometimes going to the office was to work in a more pleasant 
space. That is, even the people least inclined to work at the 
office seem to be attracted to quality space.

Exhibit 23
Since 2020, rents and demand have grown more quickly for Class A office 
space than for Class B in many US cities.

Before the pandemic, housing prices generally rose more quickly in superstar urban cores than 
in their suburbs. (For the definition of urban cores, see Box E1, “How we define cities,” in the 
executive summary.) The pandemic reversed that trend, making prices rise more quickly in the 
suburbs. Our model projects that housing demand in urban cores will nevertheless be greater in 
2030 than it was in 2019.

Demand and prices for residential real estate have grown more slowly in superstar urban 
cores than in suburbs and other cities 
In every superstar urban core that we studied, the percentage of residential real estate that was 
vacant grew between 2019 and 2022. The increase varied from 0.8 percentage point in Tokyo to 
9.9 percentage points in London (Exhibit 24).

than in the suburbs. A major reason was increased suburbanization. As we discussed in  
chapter 1, in most of the cities we studied, population growth in the suburbs relative to that in the 
urban cores sped up during the pandemic. In London, New York City, and San Francisco, where 
that phenomenon was especially severe, the difference in vacancy-rate increases between urban 
cores and suburbs was correspondingly large. In Munich, Tokyo, and Paris, where suburbanization 
was less dramatic, the vacancy rate increased at roughly the same rate in urban cores and suburbs, 
driven by pandemic-related deaths and lower immigration from other countries. 

Home prices followed the same pattern, rising eight percentage points more slowly in US 
superstar urban cores than in their suburbs from the end of 2019 to 2022 (Exhibit 25). Prices also 
rose 13 percentage points more slowly in the US superstar urban cores than in non-superstar 
urban cores. It was not an exclusively American phenomenon; an OECD report found that the 
pandemic caused a global acceleration of home price growth outside major city centers.25

Similarly, prices grew more quickly in zip codes farther away from city centers, according to our 
analysis (Exhibit 26). In fact, many cities experienced what has been called the “doughnut effect”: 
rising prices in the suburbs and falling prices in city centers.26 In San Francisco, nominal prices 
in the most strongly affected neighborhoods fell by 12 percent from the end of 2019 to 2022. 
Residences in San Francisco’s urban core are now worth $750 billion less than they would have 
been if prices there had risen at the national average rate.

In most superstar urban cores, even though demand for residential real estate has been weak,  
it will be greater in 2030 than it was in 2019 in a moderate scenario, according to our model 
(Exhibit 27). Houston, Munich, and Tokyo experience the strongest projected demand growth. 
The two exceptions are Paris and San Francisco, where population in the urban core is shrinking; 
demand in those two cities is expected to be lower in 2030 than it was in 2019. Although 
the effects of the pandemic figure into all our demand projections, they are responsible for 
significantly lower demand by 2030 in only three cities—London, New York City, and  
San Francisco.

Although demand is projected to grow in most urban cores, it is projected to grow still more in the 
suburbs. As a result, excess supply in our model is far greater in the cores than in the suburbs. 
(Recall that we define excess supply as the percentage of space that is vacant beyond the 
average from 2014 to 2019—in essence, the part of projected vacancy that is attributable to the 
pandemic in our model.) The mismatch would lead to strong price corrections, ultimately reducing 
the difference in vacancy rates between the urban core and the suburbs. 

To better understand how our model estimates demand, consider the moderate scenario for 
London (Exhibit 28). In both the urban core and the suburbs, the population and the size of the 
average home are expected to grow, adding to total demand. Furthermore, the number of people 
in an average household is expected to decline, also adding to total demand. But the effects 
of migration differ: migration out of the urban core is projected to drive down demand there, 
whereas migration into the suburbs is projected to drive up demand there.

In a severe scenario, pandemic-driven domestic out-migration is higher than in the moderate 
one. As a result, demand in 2030 is lower in that scenario than in the moderate one for most 
cities (Exhibit 29). But even in the severe scenario, net demand increases in most cities.

Both scenarios rest on the assumptions that out-migration will continue to be higher than it was 
from 2015 to 2019 and that the wave of residents who left cities in the past three years will not 
return. Those assumptions are supported by our survey results, as we discussed in chapter 1.  
But if they prove incorrect, housing demand in superstar urban cores could be greater than we 
have estimated.

situation in which prices have not yet adjusted. But ample research suggests that price elasticity 
in superstar cities is high, so any available floor space will probably be taken up quickly.27 In other 
words, lower demand is likely to push down prices and rents, and those lower prices and rents 
would quickly attract new residents and encourage existing ones to buy or rent more space, 
preventing vacancy from growing. 

Unfortunately, the downward pressure on prices and rents is unlikely to make residences in 
superstar cities—many of which suffer from expensive housing and homelessness—much more 
affordable. From December 2019 to December 2022, home prices in the United States rose by 
40 percent, more than twice as fast as inflation. In US superstar cities’ urban cores, prices grew 
more slowly, by 25 percent—but still faster than inflation. Housing there will probably become 
less expensive than it would have been without the pandemic, but home prices will continue to 
increase and will remain out of reach for many.

Retail space will continue to be challenged

A great deal of retail space in urban cores became vacant during the pandemic, and there is 
reason to think that vacancy rates will keep rising. Our model projects that demand for retail 
space in urban cores will be lower in 2030 than it was in 2019 and that some cities will be hit 
much harder than others. 

Retail vacancy has increased and rents have declined, particularly in office-dense locations
Retail real estate has struggled since the start of the pandemic. From 2019 to 2022, vacancy 
rates in the urban cores we studied increased by an average of 3.3 percentage points  
(Exhibit 30). The increase was largest in London at 6.2 percentage points, albeit from a relatively 
low starting point. During the same period, asking rents decreased 5.4 percent, on average, in 
real terms. The rents that were actually paid may have fallen even more.

Those changes were less acute in the suburbs. From 2019 to 2022, vacancy rates in London’s 
suburbs increased by just 0.2 percentage point. Similarly, vacancy rates increased by  
3.0 percentage points in Manhattan but by only 0.7 percentage point in the surrounding suburbs. 
Lower foot traffic near stores in urban cores may help explain the variation.

In Manhattan, for 
example, the neighborhoods where office space represented the greatest share of all real estate, 
such as the Financial District and the area around Grand Central Terminal, had some of the 
smallest increases in asking retail rent from 2019 to 2022 (Exhibit 31). 

There are several reasons to think that vacancy rates could keep rising. First, many retailers’ 
leases have yet to reach their renewal date, so those retailers have not yet had an opportunity 
to downsize. Second, landlords have made concessions designed to keep stores from closing 
permanently, such as deferring rent payments and allowing retailers to pay rents calculated 
as a percentage of in-store sales. Those concessions have probably encouraged retailers to 
delay closing, despite drops in the profitability of their stores, but it is unlikely that they will 
delay forever. Third, though spending in brick-and-mortar stores rebounded in 2022, economic 
uncertainty and waning consumer confidence may slow such spending in the future.

Differences in projected demand among cities can be attributed to the relative contribution of 
the growth drivers that our model used, including population growth, per capita retail spending, 
and online spending as a share of all retail spending. For example, in London’s urban core, 
population outflows from 2019 to 2022 were among the largest that we studied, so population 
growth is not projected to boost demand much (Exhibit 33). And retail spending in London is 
projected to decrease by 2.2 percent per year through 2030, more slowly than in any other city 
in our sample. As a result, such spending does not contribute much to demand for retail space 
in London. What does have a major effect on demand is online spending as a share of all retail 
spending, which is higher in the United Kingdom than in any other country we studied except 
China.

Demand for retail space may also vary between urban cores and their suburbs. For example, in 
Paris, projected demand decreases by 7.6 million square feet in the urban core but increases by 
5.6 million square feet in the suburbs (Exhibit 34). Net out-migration from urban cores to suburbs 
is a strong driver of this variation; the differences in foot traffic and spending discussed in  
chapter 1 are others. In some superstar cities, as office attendance declined, workers shopped 
less near the office. However, in Paris, that behavioral shift was muted and did not drive 
significant differences in demand between the urban core and the suburbs.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estate3.  What strongly affected 
neighborhoods and 
cities have in common

In the previous chapters, we described the behavioral shifts that the pandemic has caused 
in superstar cities and analyzed their impact on real estate demand. Although the shifts have 
happened everywhere we looked, the degree of change and the pace of recovery have varied 
significantly from city to city. A review of various components of this research—regression 
analyses, survey responses, and literature reviews—suggests that cities where the pandemic has 
strongly affected real estate demand tend to have certain characteristics. (We were unable to 
determine which of those characteristics correlated most strongly with the impact on demand.)

Here, we take a closer look at a few neighborhoods and cities, focusing on those characteristics, 
which fall into two categories. Some of them are related to the business mix in a city. Specifically, 
cities with a larger share of workers in the knowledge economy, a higher number of large firms, a 
higher ratio of commuters to residents, and more cultural acceptance of remote work tended to 
experience a greater impact on demand.28 Those factors lead to lower rates of office attendance, 
which reduce demand for office space directly, reduce demand for retail space by diminishing the 
number of office workers shopping at urban stores, and reduce demand for residential space by 
prompting people to move out of urban cores.

The other characteristics that correlate with the impact on demand are related to the urban 
structure of a city. Specifically, cities with office-dense real estate and little mixed-use 
development, as well as expensive housing and little green space, tended to experience greater 
impact on demand.29 Such characteristics make places less desirable for working, living,  
and shopping.

Two of those characteristics correlate with the impact on demand not just at the city level but also 
at the neighborhood level. We examined neighborhoods (defined by zip codes) in Manhattan, San 
Francisco County, and Harris County (home of Houston). According to our analysis, the larger the 
share of real estate in a neighborhood that was occupied by offices, the more out-migration from 
that neighborhood. Similarly, home prices correlated with out-migration: pricier neighborhoods 
experienced more out-migration. (Data limitations prevented us from finding out whether the 
other characteristics also correlated with demand at the neighborhood level.)

In this chapter, we focus on two Manhattan neighborhoods to see how those effects worked at 
the local level. We then study them in San Francisco, Paris, and Tokyo, cities whose real estate 
was affected very differently by the pandemic.

28  In this chapter, we define the knowledge economy as the finance and insurance, professional services, real estate and 

rental leasing services, and information industries, as well as the industry that the US Census Bureau calls “management of 
companies and enterprises.”

29  The relationship between demand and green space in cities is described in Rudiger Ahrend et al., Changes in the geography 

housing demand after the onset of COVID-19: First results from large metropolitan areas in 13 OECD countries, OECD 
Economics Department Working Papers, number 1713, April 2022.

59

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateBusiness mix and urban structure make a 
difference at the neighborhood level

Two very different Manhattan neighborhoods show that business mix and urban structure 
correlate with demand at the neighborhood level. The business mix of the first neighborhood, 
the Financial District, is heavily skewed toward the knowledge economy; 50 percent of all office 
space there is occupied by knowledge-economy tenants, especially those in business services. 
The Financial District’s urban structure is office-dense: 80 percent of real estate is dedicated 
to offices, 17 percent to residences, and just 2 percent to retail. The average price of a home is 
roughly $1.5 million.

Now consider the nearby Lower East Side. The business mix is very different from the Financial 
District’s: just 22 percent of office real estate space is dedicated to the knowledge economy. 
The urban structure is different as well. Just 7 percent of all space on the Lower East Side is 
dedicated to offices, while 84 percent is residences and 9 percent is retail. The average home 
price, about $1.0 million, is considerably lower than in the Financial District.30 

Those factors help us understand why the two neighborhoods were affected so differently during 
the pandemic. The domestic out-migration rate from the start of 2020 to the start of 2022 was 
2.2 times higher in the Financial District than on the Lower East Side, for example. It stands to 
reason that residents of the Financial District could easily work from home, as the prevalence of 
the knowledge economy there suggests, and were therefore likelier to move to bigger homes far 
from their offices; meanwhile, expensive housing gave them another reason to leave.

At the city level too, business mix and urban structure drive differences

Three cities whose real estate was affected very differently by the pandemic—San Francisco, 
Paris, and Tokyo—demonstrate how business mix and urban structure explain pandemic-driven 
differences in demand for real estate (Exhibit 35). For example, in San Francisco, a city where the 
proclivity for remote work was high and mixed-use development was rare, demand was affected 
strongly. In Tokyo, a city different in both respects, the reverse was true.

In San Francisco, a city where the 
proclivity for remote work was 
high and mixed-use development 
was rare, demand was affected 
strongly by the pandemic.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateSan Francisco, a bastion of the knowledge economy, has been strongly affected  
by the pandemic 
In San Francisco, the pandemic has led to particularly strong behavioral shifts. Office attendance 
has stabilized at about 50 percent of the prepandemic level, the third-weakest recovery among 
the ten largest US metropolitan areas.31 Migration out of San Francisco’s urban core reduced 
the population by a cumulative 5.8 percent from mid-2020 to mid-2022, and even the suburbs 
suffered out-migration and a population decline of 0.6 percent. Foot traffic near stores in the  
San Francisco metro area remains 24 percent below prepandemic levels. 

As a result, real estate has experienced higher vacancy rates in San Francisco than in most  
of the cities we studied. From 2019 to 2022, the vacancy rate for office space increased by  
13 percentage points (the largest change among the cities we studied), and the vacancy rate for 
residential space increased by 5.0 percentage points (a far larger change than the US average of 
0.4 percentage point). Furthermore, during the same period, home prices grew by just 13 percent 
in San Francisco, much more slowly than they did in the United States as a whole (43 percent).

San Francisco’s business mix helps explain the impact. The city has long cultivated a technology-
focused economy with a large population of office workers, especially knowledge-economy 
workers. It has many inbound commuters, as the employment-to-population ratio shows: that 
ratio, a proxy for the prevalence of commuters, is 0.87, starkly higher than the national average 
of 0.48. Furthermore, San Francisco’s employers, many of which are in the technology industry, 
may have been more likely to be aware of and adopt remote work technology when the pandemic 
began. And in our survey, respondents in San Francisco said that their ideal number of days to 
work in the office was 2.7, the lowest number in the cities we studied. 

San Francisco’s urban structure also helps explain why the pandemic affected its demand so 
strongly. Home prices in San Francisco County are five times higher than the national average 
and almost twice as high as prices in the suburbs. And San Francisco has limited mixed-use 
development: offices represent 30 percent or more of all real estate in nine of San Francisco’s  
26 neighborhoods, a far greater share than in Houston, where that is the case in only five of  
39 neighborhoods. 

Our model shows a dire outlook for San Francisco’s future. Residential vacancy rates there could 
be at least seven percentage points higher than their 2010–19 average by 2030. Demand for 
office space could be 20 percent lower than it was in 2019, and demand for retail space could be 
17 percent lower. Demand for residential space could be 2 percent lower in 2030 than it was in 
2019—the smallest such increase among the cities we modeled. (The model does not consider 
price elasticity; that is, it does not account for the fact that when demand decreases, prices fall, 
pushing demand partway back up. For more about the model, see chapter 2 and the technical 
appendix.)

Paris, more diversified and less expensive than San Francisco, was less strongly affected
Pandemic-caused behavioral shifts have been less striking in Paris than in San Francisco. 
Office attendance in Paris has dropped to an average of 3.4 days per week, only slightly below 
the overall average in our survey (3.5 days). Net out-migration during the pandemic was not 
much greater than before. The city’s overall population trends have not changed much either; 
population continues to decline in the urban core and grow in the suburbs. But foot traffic near 
stores in the metro area remains 16 percent below prepandemic levels. 

The behavioral shifts have increased vacancies and reduced projected real estate demand in 
Paris, though not as sharply as in San Francisco. From 2019 to 2022, vacancy rates in Paris 
increased by two percentage points for office space, two percentage points for residential 
space, and four percentage points for retail space.

Business mix helps explain why Paris was affected less severely by the pandemic than San 
Francisco was. Paris’s industry composition is diverse. Unlike San Francisco, which is heavily 
dependent on the knowledge economy, Paris is home to companies that are global leaders in a 
wide variety of industries, such as beauty, hospitality, consumer retail, defense, and finance.32 

But Paris’s urban structure has features that push residents away as well as those that pull them 
in. On the one hand, home prices are twice as high in Paris’s urban core as in its suburbs and four 
times higher than the national average, perhaps explaining the out-migration from the urban core 
that has been happening since at least 2010 (Exhibit 36). On the other hand, Paris has a great 
deal of mixed-use development. 

According to our model, demand for office space in Paris in 2030 could be 13 percent lower than 
it was in 2019, and demand for retail space could be 9 percent lower. Demand for residential 
space in the suburbs could be 9 percent higher in 2030 than in 2019, while demand in the urban 
core could fall by 4 percent.

Tokyo, industrially diverse and relatively inexpensive, was affected only lightly  
by the pandemic
The pandemic-induced behavioral shifts in Tokyo have been among the smallest we studied. 
As in Paris, office attendance has dropped to 3.4 days per week, only slightly below the overall 
average of 3.5. From October 2020 to October 2022, Tokyo’s urban core and suburbs grew at 
about the same pace—in stark contrast with most of the cities we studied, where the suburbs 
grew much more quickly. However, despite those relatively small shifts in office attendance and 
migration, foot traffic near stores remains 9 percent lower than it was before the pandemic in 
Tokyo as a whole. It is down 4 percent in the suburbs and 20 percent in the urban core. 

Demand for real estate has therefore been affected less in Tokyo than in most of the cities we 
studied. While the vacancy rate for office space increased by six percentage points, residential 
vacancy was unaffected. Strong home demand in Tokyo’s urban core led home prices there to 
grow slightly faster than the national average rate from 2020 to 2022 (Exhibit 37). 

Tokyo’s business mix is partly responsible for the city’s muted behavioral shifts and relatively 
rosy outcomes. The most common industry for workers to be employed in is wholesale and retail 
trade, in contrast with technology-dependent San Francisco.33 Like Paris, Japan has a culture 
that values being present in the office, in particular among employees of small and medium-size 
businesses; in our survey, respondents in Tokyo said that they expected to be required to be in 
the office 3.7 days per week, higher than Paris’s 3.3 days. Loyalty to employers is also common 
in Japan, as are lower rates of technology adoption than in San Francisco.34 Furthermore, online 
spending as a share of retail spending was lower in Japan than in any other country we studied; 
that may have contributed to higher office attendance and continued in-person retail shopping.

And with regard to urban structure, while Tokyo suffers from the same affordability problems 
that other superstar cities do, they are somewhat less severe. In Tokyo, home prices in the urban 
core are 2.1 times higher than the national average. In Paris, they are 4.1 times higher, and in San 
Francisco, they are 5.0 times higher.

Our model estimates that future demand for real estate will be healthier in Tokyo than in most of 
the cities we studied. Demand for office space is projected to fall by just 9 percent from 2019 to 
2030. Projected demand for residential space grows by 12 percent from 2019 to 2030 (lagging 
behind only Houston and New York City), and projected demand for retail space falls by just  
2 percent (lagging behind only Shanghai). 

Tokyo’s business mix is partly 
responsible for the city’s muted 
behavioral shifts and relatively 
rosy outcomes.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estate4.  Thriving in 
hybrid places

The pandemic has dramatically changed the way people work, live, and shop in superstar 
cities. As we described earlier in this report, the rise of hybrid work has encouraged people to 
work at the office less, move to homes that are farther from the office, and shop less in urban 
cores. The result is higher vacancy rates, which threaten the vibrancy of neighborhoods and 
make urban cores less attractive to employers, employees, and residents (see Box E1, “How 
we define cities,” in the executive summary). 

These are challenges, to be sure, but they also present an opportunity for historic transformation 
in superstar cities. To adapt to a new reality in which hybrid work is widespread and permanent, 
urban stakeholders could consider adopting more hybrid approaches themselves. At the 
neighborhood and building levels, and even in the design of the floors of buildings, choosing 
diversity, adaptability, and flexibility rather than uniformity can help cities thrive.

At the neighborhood level, consider mixed-use development

One way cities could adapt is through mixed-use neighborhoods—that is, neighborhoods 
that are not dominated by a single type of real estate (especially offices) but instead 
accommodate a diverse mix of office, residential, and retail space. Such hybrid 
neighborhoods were becoming more popular even before the pandemic. And now that the 
pandemic has reduced demand for offices, cities have been left with vacant space that could 
be converted to other uses. Furthermore, our research shows that mixed-use neighborhoods 
have suffered less during the pandemic than have office-dense neighborhoods. That 
resilience gives investors, developers, and cities still more reason to engage in placemaking. 

Redeveloping neighborhoods is an enormous undertaking, of course, so mobilizing the many 
stakeholders is important. Governments may be particularly helpful in reforming restrictive 
zoning policies. Investors would be needed to finance redevelopment (see Box 2, “Investing 
in the future of urban real estate”). And developers would be the ones to turn mixed-use 
visions into realities. Before they break ground on a mixed-use project, leading developers 
carefully consider the different types of journeys they want to enable for residents, 
employees, and shoppers—for example, how a resident might proceed from her apartment to 
a café to a subway station in the morning, or how an office employee might shop for groceries 
on his way home from work.

To adapt to a new reality in which 
hybrid work is permanent, urban 
stakeholders could adopt hybrid 
approaches themselves.

67

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateBox 2
Investing in the future of urban real estate

Declines in demand for urban real estate could have an 
enormous financial impact, lowering prices substantially— 
and the impact could be magnified by rising interest rates 
and expanding capitalization rates. In a recent report, MGI 
showed that the total market value of US real estate grew 
by 3.1 percent a year in real terms between 2000 and 2022. 
Such growth could continue, but different outcomes are also 
plausible, as several scenarios modeled in that report make 
clear. In a scenario in which inflation and interest rates stay 
elevated, total property values in the United States shrink 
by 1 percent per year in real terms between now and 2030. 
They shrink by as much as 4 percent per year in a scenario 
in which strong interest rate hikes and growing financial and 
economic uncertainty lead to sharp asset corrections.1 

Facing this reality and recognizing any property losses—
either by selling properties at a loss or by marking down 
the value of those properties on their balance sheets—will 
be the critical first step in redevelopment. That is because 
owners who ignore losses are not investing in properties 
in the meantime. But some will be reluctant to recognize 
their losses because doing so requires them to raise 
fresh equity. They may prefer to wait, hoping for prices to 
recover and meanwhile smoothing out their losses over a 
long period. Even when owners are prepared to recognize 
losses, they sometimes feel pressure not to do so from 

shareholders or partners. Policy makers may want to 
consider encouraging loss recognition by regulating it or by 
offering owners incentives and recapitalization support to 
accelerate it. 

Recapitalization will need to follow. Any losses—especially 
once they are recognized—could challenge the balance 
sheets of banks and other financial-services firms that 
have lent heavily to real estate projects. Those institutions 
already face rising interest rates, which push down the 
value of property and make defaults on loans more likely. 
If banks also suffer deposit withdrawals on a large scale, 
they might be forced to conduct a fire sale of their assets, 
making existing problems worse. Financial institutions and 
governments should closely monitor the situation.

This can be both a challenge and an opportunity for 
investors and financiers. Significant capital will be needed 
to finance redevelopment and to heal damaged balance 
sheets. However, in a world of widespread hybrid work, 
they will need to rethink the way they appraise the value of 
properties. At a minimum, they should continue investing 
in analytical capabilities—for example, to understand 
which properties are salvageable and which are not. 
Neither historical trends nor traditional analyses of market 
comparables will be enough to make accurate forecasts.

1  For a more detailed description of the scenarios, see The future of wealth and growth hangs in the balance, McKinsey Global Institute, May 2023.

Lower Manhattan might serve as a model of how to encourage mixed uses. After the  
September 11 attacks there, many newly vacant office buildings were converted into residential 
buildings. The city and state governments encouraged those conversions by streamlining the 
zoning and permitting processes and by providing tax incentives. But not every attempt to 
diversify a neighborhood needs to be that ambitious, as is shown by another New York example—
the High Line, an old railroad slated for demolition that was converted into a widely acclaimed 
urban park. 

Suburbs can benefit from hybridity as well. City dwellers, untethered from their daily commutes 
and thus less concerned about living far from urban cores, are increasingly seeking larger 
homes in greener areas. More housing and retail in the suburbs could help satisfy their 
preferences. More multifamily housing could be particularly beneficial because it would 
accommodate more people than single-family homes do. So long as the apartments are larger 
and more comfortable than apartments in urban cores, they could attract urbanites seeking 
space. Suburban policy makers could consider encouraging multifamily development by 
adjusting zoning, offering incentives to developers, and reexamining regulations that prevent 
housing from being built, such as those governing minimum dwelling sizes. Furthermore, denser 
suburbs would bring social and environmental benefits (see Box 3, “Affordable, sustainable real 
estate after the pandemic”).

Affordable, sustainable real estate after the pandemic

Affordability and sustainability are two of the most pressing 
problems of our time. Housing shortages in superstar cities  
have long resulted in prices that many people cannot afford.  
And buildings generate a large share of global carbon emissions.

hence the impact on overall affordability in cities, will be limited. 
In the cities we studied, even if all excess office space were 
converted into housing, the amount of residential space would 
grow by less than 3 percent (Exhibit 38).

The pandemic-induced shifts that we discuss in this report 
could be good news on both fronts if well handled. Begin with 
affordability. Residents are shifting their housing preferences 
toward suburbs and non-superstar cities, where prices are 
lower—and where new units can be created more easily and 
at lower cost. In urban cores, in turn, developers could convert 
newly vacant office buildings into residences, boosting the 
supply of housing there. But the scale of such conversions, and

On the sustainability front, redevelopment resulting from the 
pandemic is an opportunity to replace older buildings with new 
ones that are more energy-efficient. And fewer days in the 
office mean fewer commutes. Yet pandemic-induced migration 
to suburbs also means longer commutes and lower-density 
units that tend to be less energy- and transit-efficient. Transit-
oriented, walkable, multifamily, and mixed-use developments in 
suburbs could help.

To adapt to declining demand for traditional office and retail space, developers could create 
hybrid buildings. The most ambitious vision is a universal, “neutral-use” building whose design, 
infrastructure, and technology could be easily modified to serve different uses. Imagine a 
medical building that could be easily converted into, say, a hotel or an apartment building if 
customers’ preferences changed. More modestly, buildings could be designed to accommodate 
different degrees of collaborative and individual work or different arrangements of open and 
closed offices. They could also include technology that promotes flexibility, such as sensors to 
track patterns of usage, which can inform an employer’s approach to hybrid work.

Hybrid buildings would bring at least two advantages. One, of course, is that they would protect 
owners from shifts in preferences that are impossible to predict now. The second relates to a 
trend toward shorter leases in the office sector. Because tenants will now be moving in and out 
more frequently, buildings might become more valuable if they grow more adaptable.

Developers could also try to convert offices into kinds of space for which there is more demand, 
such as apartments, hotels, and schools. Conversions are very hard, however. Obstacles include 
rezoning, renegotiating existing lease commitments to allow for renovations (for example, if just 
a few tenants remain in a building but they have a lot of time left on their leases), and dealing with 
physical limitations (for example, the usual layout of office buildings, which is difficult to divide 
into apartment-sized dwellings that receive natural light). Conversions are also not a panacea: 
even a large number of them would not meaningfully improve affordability (see Box 3, “Affordable, 
sustainable real estate after the pandemic”). Still, for owners facing the prospect of lower 
occupancy and lower rents in their office buildings, the opportunity cost of conversion has fallen, 
and the number of successful conversions may grow.

Developers of retail space too could keep adaptability in mind. Of late, retail tenants have 
been evaluating their footprints with a stricter eye, shutting down stores or moving into smaller 
spaces. For example, the average size of a store fell from about 3,400 square feet in 2019 to 
about 3,000 square feet in 2021.35 That shift was probably caused partly by the closure of large 
stores and partly by the opening of new store types, such as the mix of “grab and go” stores, 
pharmacy-focused stores, and “general stores” that a leading drugstore chain has recently 
launched to cater to different customer segments. If developers built more adaptable spaces, 
they would be likelier to remain relevant to tenants’ shifting needs. Developers might also 
offer new store formats, such as spaces intended for delivery and fulfillment or for logistics 
rather than traditional retail. Or they might design buildings that are more integrated with their 
environments—for example, with dining spaces that extend onto sidewalks.

Office-to-housing conversions 
are not a panacea: even a 
large number of them would 
not meaningfully improve 
affordability.

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateAt the floor level, design space that is modular and multiuse 

Tenants in urban cores—both the employers who rent office space and the merchants who rent 
retail space—may have to start “earning the commute” from office workers and shoppers who 
would otherwise visit less often. They can do that by providing more attractive experiences. Here 
too, thinking flexibly and adaptably can help.

For example, the office does not have to be just a place to work; it can also be a place where 
employees enjoy amenities provided by their employers, such as outdoor communal spaces and 
compelling events. Office tenants might try to attract them by building magnetic, hospitality-
oriented workplaces. (Those that find it difficult to create such an environment in their own 
offices might rely on providers of coworking space or landlord-provided community workspaces.) 
Office tenants might also design more modular spaces that can adapt to changes in work 
patterns from week to week. And the most forward-thinking tenants will provide an efficient, 
digital way to organize hybrid work patterns and preferences.

Retailers too may have to “earn the commute” by designing spaces that cater to many different 
uses. A prime example is stores that easily accommodate omnichannel retail—a single, seamless 
experience for customers, whether they shop online or in person. The omnichannel experience 
is quickly becoming the industry standard. Similarly, stores can provide experiential retail. For 
example, a leading US sporting goods company is testing a new type of store that doubles as 
a community sports center, and a department store brand is launching smaller stores where 
customers can pick up products bought online, get clothes altered, find style advice, and 
patronize a beauty salon. 

Indeed, it is not hard to imagine more “hybrid floors” in which offices, residences, and stores exist 
side by side. For floors—as for buildings and neighborhoods—turning empty spaces into hybrid 
places may not simply be a way to counter the damage wrought by the pandemic. It could be a 
way to transform superstar cities and prepare them for a dynamic, prosperous future.

Retailers may have to ‘earn the 
commute’ by designing spaces 
that cater to many different uses.

Technical appendix

This appendix offers information about two important components of our research: the survey 
that we conducted to understand the behavioral shifts caused by the pandemic, and the models 
that we built to project demand for office, residential, and retail space in several scenarios.

Our survey

In chapter 1, we describe many pandemic-induced behavioral shifts. We deduced some of those 
shifts from a large international survey that we conducted in October and November 2022 to 
learn how office workers’ behavior had changed—in ways that could affect real estate—during 
the pandemic. We surveyed nearly 13,000 full-time office workers, all of them at least 18 years 
old, in six countries: China (about 2,600 people), France (1,400), Germany (1,900), Japan (1,700), 
the United Kingdom (2,300), and the United States (3,200).

We ensured that the initial set of respondents who received the survey had the same distribution 
of age and sex as their country did. In the United States, where we had more information about 
potential respondents, we were also able to account for income, ethnicity, and region (that is, the 
Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).

We considered responses only from people who met certain requirements, such as being  
full-time office workers or remote workers performing office-related duties. That group was 
called the target audience.

Then, in order to increase the number of responses, we sent the survey to a larger set of 
respondents, one whose demographic characteristics matched those of the target audience. We 
then weighted respondents from each country to reflect the country’s distribution of age and sex 
within the population of office workers (a distribution that we determined by examining the target 
audience’s responses). Once again, we were able to weight US respondents by income, ethnicity, 
and region as well. Where we present global averages, we simply averaged results from the 
countries we studied rather than weighting those results by population.

We intentionally overrepresented certain groups. First, we overrepresented respondents from  
17 cities of particular interest to make sure that we had enough information about those cities. 
The cities were Atlanta (where we surveyed about 480 people), Beijing (540), Berlin (400), 
Chicago (460), Chongqing (70), Hong Kong (500), Houston (440), London (840), Los Angeles 
(440), Munich (550), New York City (440), Osaka (490), Paris (730), San Francisco (410),  
Shanghai (560), Shenzhen (490), and Tokyo (560).36 Second, we overrepresented people who 
had moved after the pandemic began to make sure that we had enough information about 
migration patterns.

36  Those numbers do not add up to 13,000 because we also surveyed people from other cities.

73

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateThe questions that we asked covered the following areas:

 — Respondents’ personal characteristics (for example, “What is the highest degree or level  

of school you have completed?”).

 — Employment information (for example, “What is your typical commute time to the office, 

one-way?”).

 — Office attendance and factors motivating working from home (for example, “On average, 
how many days of the week did you work in the office pre-COVID [late 2019]?” and “Why do 
you typically choose to work in the office, on days you do not work from home?”).

 — Trade-offs related to working from home (for example, “How much of your compensation 
[as a percentage of your pretax salary and bonus] would you be willing to forgo to be able to 
work from home for your ideal number of days per week versus being in the office  
every day?”).

 — Space needs (for example, “For the time that you are in the office today, how has your 

allocation of time among types of spaces changed relative to how you utilized spaces before 
the pandemic [that is, late 2019]?”).

 — Retail spending (for example, “How has your share of retail expenditure at the following 

locations shifted today [fall 2022] versus pre-COVID [late 2019]?”).

 — Most recent move and motivating factors (for example, “In what ways did the pandemic 

influence your move?”).

 — Impact of move on preferences and persistence (for example, “In what ways has working 

from home changed your preferences around where you live and what kind of space  
you need?”).

Finally, we ensured that each part of our analysis had a sufficiently large sample. For example, 
every industry shown in Exhibit E1 had at least 300 respondents.

Our models

In chapter 2, we offer projections of demand for real estate in 2030. Those projections were 
generated by three interrelated models we built, one apiece for office, residential, and retail 
space. We used each model to project demand in three scenarios—called reversion, moderate, 
and severe—in which the pandemic’s effects were increasingly strong. The factors that each 
model took into account (some of which were drawn from another model’s output) and the ways 
the scenarios differ from one another are described below.

Office space model
Our model for projecting demand for office space considered the following four factors:

 — Office employment, defined as the total number of office workers in an urban core.

 — Office attendance, defined as employees’ current office attendance as a percentage of 

their office attendance before the pandemic. For example, if an employee went to the office 
five days a week before the pandemic but now goes to the office three days a week, that 
employee’s office attendance is 60 percent.

74

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estate — Employee coordination, defined as the maximum share of workers in the office at a given 
time that employers need to provide space for. This factor is important because office 
attendance figures alone may overstate the degree to which demand for office space has 
fallen. If all employees go to the office only once a week, but all are present on Tuesday, 
demand will be no smaller than it was when they worked in the office daily. By contrast, if 
all employees go to the office three days a week, but the company coordinates attendance 
so that no more than 60 percent of employees are present on any day, demand for space 
is reduced by 40 percent. Our model assumes that employers will enforce coordination to 
capture half of the space savings from reduced office attendance. For example, if attendance 
decreases by 40 percent, the model assumes that demand for square footage will drop by  
20 percent.

 — Space per seat, defined as the total usable square footage allocated to each office worker. 

Space per seat was declining even before the pandemic.

We varied the values for the first two of those four factors to estimate demand in three scenarios.

 — In the reversion scenario, we essentially assume that the world will revert to its condition 

before the pandemic. Office attendance returns to its prepandemic level by 2022 and stays at 
that level through 2030. Office employment growth is based on the historic rate of population 
growth as well as shifts in labor force participation rates and in the share of office workers. 
Employee coordination and space per seat are held constant at their current levels.

 — In the moderate scenario, the pandemic’s effects on population, and therefore on office 

employment and office attendance, are stronger. (The effects on population are drawn from 
the moderate scenario in our model for residential space, which is described below.) By 2025, 
office attendance is higher than it is now but still lower than it was before the pandemic, and 
that partial recovery continues indefinitely. Employee coordination and space per seat are 
again held constant at their current levels.

 — In the severe scenario, the pandemic’s effects are long-lasting and reduce population 

growth, so the effects on office employment and office attendance are even stronger. (The 
effects on population are drawn from the severe scenario in our model for residential space.) 
Office attendance remains at current levels indefinitely. Employee coordination and space 
per seat are again held constant at their current levels.

Residential space model
Our model for projecting demand for residential space considered the following three factors:

 — Population, defined as the current number of residents in an area. We modeled population 

separately for the urban core and suburbs of each city (see Box E1, “How we define cities,” in 
the executive summary). During the pandemic, increased out-migration from urban cores to 
suburbs disrupted population growth.

 — Average household size, defined as the average number of members in each household. We 
assumed that through 2030, average household size would change at its historical rate from 
2010 to 2020.

 — Average size of home, defined as the average number of rooms per home in the United 

States and the average number of square feet per home in the other countries we studied. 
Here too, we assumed that through 2030, average household size would grow at its historical 
rate from 2010 to 2020.

75

McKinsey Global Institute | Empty spaces and hybrid places: The pandemic’s lasting impact on real estateWe varied the values for the first of those three factors to estimate demand in three scenarios.

 — In the reversion scenario, people who moved during the pandemic return to their original 
residences in urban cores or suburbs by 2025, driven by a full return to prepandemic rates 
of office attendance. Because of their return, excess migration, which we define as out-
migration from urban cores during the pandemic that exceeded the 2015–19 average, falls 
below zero. After 2025, population growth returns fully to its prepandemic rate (that is, the 
annual rate from 2010 to 2020).

 — In the moderate scenario, people who moved during the pandemic do not move back, 
because hybrid work is now the standard working model. Excess migration continues, 
but it is small and gradually falls to zero, and population growth in most cities returns to its 
prepandemic rate by 2030.

 — In the severe scenario, people who moved during the pandemic do not move back. Excess 
migration continues, is high, and does not fall to zero until after 2030. As a result, population 
growth in most of the cities we studied is much lower than it was before the pandemic.

Retail space model
Our model for projecting demand for retail space considered the following six factors:

 — Population, defined as the current number of residents in an area. We modeled population 

separately for the urban core and suburbs of each city.

 — Impact of remote work on spending, defined as the change in retail spending in physical 
stores resulting from changes in office attendance as commuters come to workplaces less 
often and spend less money in stores near them.

 — E-commerce penetration, defined as online spending as a share of total retail spending. 
In the early years of the pandemic, e-commerce penetration grew more quickly than it had 
historically because of quarantines, social distancing, and increased remote work.

 — Sales productivity, defined as in-store retail sales per square foot of occupied retail space. 
For example, if a store with 100 square feet of space generated $1,000 in annual sales, sales 
productivity would be $10 per square foot.

 — In-store retail sales, defined as annual retail sales that occur in a physical store within 
a metropolitan area. To determine the growth of in-store retail sales, we began with the 
projected rate of general consumer spending at the city level through 2030 and adjusted it 
for population change, the impact of remote work on spending, and e-commerce penetration.

 — Commuters, defined as the number of people who commute to the urban core for work. We 
assumed that the ratio of commuters (but not the number of commutes) to the population of 
the urban core would remain constant at its 2019 value through 2030.

We varied the values for the first four of those six factors to estimate demand in three scenarios.

 — In the reversion scenario, as a result of employees’ full return to the office, office commuters’ 

retail spending near the office returns to prepandemic levels by 2025. The population 
assumptions are drawn from the reversion scenario in our residential space model, and the 
office attendance assumptions that inform the impact of remote work on spending are pulled 
from the reversion scenario in our office space model. E-commerce penetration returns to its 
prepandemic trend line by 2025. Sales productivity remains at its 2019 level.

 — In the moderate scenario, employees engage in only a partial return to the office. The 
population assumptions are drawn from the moderate scenario in our residential space 
model, and the office attendance assumptions that inform the impact of remote work on 
spending are pulled from the moderate scenario in our office space model. E-commerce

constant at its 2019 level in all cities except Beijing and Shanghai, where recent growth gives 
us reason to expect a future increase.

 — In the severe scenario, retail spending remains at its current level. The population 

assumptions are drawn from the severe scenario in our residential space model, and the 
office attendance assumptions that inform the impact of remote work on spending are 
pulled from the severe scenario in our office space model. Pandemic-induced increases 
in e-commerce penetration continue, except in cities where e-commerce penetration has 
already returned to prepandemic rates of growth. Sales productivity grows slightly in all cities.

Kuijpers, Adrian Kwok, Daniel Läubli, James Patchett, Ben Safran, Anthony Shorris,  
and Alex Wolkomir.

The report was edited by MGI senior editor Benjamin Plotinsky, together with senior data 
visualization editor Chuck Burke and editorial operations manager Vasudha Gupta. We also thank 
our colleagues David Batcheck, Cecilia Bayer, Tim Beacom, Amanda Covington, Shannon Ensor, 
Vero Henze, Karen Jones, Stephen Landau, Janet Michaud, Diane Rice, Rebeca Robboy,  
Rachel Robinson, Katie Shearer, and Nathan Wilson for their support.

This research contributes to MGI’s mission to help business and policy leaders understand the 
forces transforming the global economy. As with all MGI research, it is independent and has not 
been commissioned or sponsored in any way by any business, government, or other institution.
