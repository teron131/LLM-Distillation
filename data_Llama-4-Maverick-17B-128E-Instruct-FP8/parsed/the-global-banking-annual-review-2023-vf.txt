Executive summary

Banking has had to chart a challenging course over 
the past few years, in the face of increased over­
sight, digital innovation, and new competitors, and 
all at a time when interest rates were at historic lows. 
The last few months have also brought their share  
of upsets, including liquidity woes and bank failures. 
But broadly speaking, a favorable wind now seems  
to have returned to the industry’s sails: viewed as a 
whole, the past 18 months have been the best 
period for global banking overall since at least 2007, 
as rising interest rates have boosted profits in  
a more benign credit environment. 

Below the surface, too, much has changed: balance 
sheets and transactions have increasingly moved out 

of traditional banks to nontraditional institutions 
and to parts of the market that are capital­light and 
often differently regulated—for example, to digital 
payment specialists and private markets, including 
alternative asset management firms. While the 
growth of assets under management outside of 
banks’ balance sheets is not new, our analysis 
suggests that the traditional core of the banking 
sector—the balance sheet—now finds itself at a 
tipping point. For example, between 2015 and 2022, 
more than 70 percent of the net increase of financial 
funds ended up not on banking balance sheets,  
but held by insurance and pension funds, sovereign 
wealth funds and public pension funds, private 
capital, and other alternative investments, as well

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transitionas retail and institutional investors.1 Given the size of 
this movement, we have broadened the scope of 
this year’s Global Banking Annual Review to define 
banks as including all financial institutions except 
insurance companies.

In this year’s review, we focus on this “Great Banking 
Transition,” analyzing causes and effects and 
considering whether the improved performance  
in 2022–23 and the recent rise in interest rates  
in many economies could change its dynamics. To 
conclude, we suggest five priorities for financial 
institutions as they look to reinvent and future­proof 
themselves. The five are the following: exploiting 
leading technologies (including AI), flexing and 
potentially even unbundling the balance sheet, scaling 
or exiting transaction business, leveling up distri­
bution, and adapting to the evolving risk land scape. 
All financial institutions will need to examine each of 
their businesses to assess where their compet itive 
advantages lie across and within each of the three 
core banking activities of balance sheets, trans­
actions, and distribution. And they will need to do  
so in a world in which technology and AI will play 
more prominent roles and against the backdrop of  
a shifting macroeconomic environment and 
heightened geopolitical risks.

The recent upturn arises from the 500­basis­point 
increase in interest rates since the second quarter 
of 2022 in the United States, echoed in other 
developed economies. This has brought with it a long­
awaited improvement in net interest margins that 
boosted the sector’s profits by about $280 billion in 
2022 and lifted return on equity (ROE) to 12 percent 
in 2022 and an expected 13 percent in 2023, 
compared with an average of just 9 percent since 
2010. Over the past year, the banking sector has 
continued its journey of continuous cost improvement: 
the cost­income ratio dropped by seven percentage 
points from 59 percent in 2012 to about 52 percent 

in 2022 (partially driven by margin changes), and  
the trend was also visible in the cost­per­asset ratio 
(which declined from 1.6 to 1.5). 

The ROE growth was accompanied by volatility over 
the past 18 months. This contributed to the collapse 
or rescue of high­profile banks in the United States 
and the government­brokered takeover of one  
of Switzerland’s oldest and biggest banks. The 
strongest performers of past years, including 
fintechs and cryptocurrency players, have struggled 
against this backdrop. 

Performance varied widely within categories. While 
some financial institutions across markets have 
generated a premium ROE, strong growth in 
earnings, and above­average price­to­earnings  
and price­to­book multiples, others have lagged 
behind. While more than 40 percent of payments 
providers have an ROE above 14 percent, almost  
35 percent have an ROE below 8 percent. Among 
wealth and asset managers, which typically have 
margins of about 30 percent, more than one­third 
have an ROE above 14 percent, while more than  
40 percent have an ROE below 8 percent. Bank 
performance varies significantly, too. These 
variations indicate the extent to which operational 
excellence and decisions relating to cost, efficiency, 
customer retention, and other issues affecting 
performance are more important than ever for 
banking. The strongest performers tend to use the 
balance sheet effectively, are customer centric,  
and often lead on technology usage.

The geographical divergence we have noted in 
previous years also continues to widen; banks 
grouped along the crescent formed by the Indian 
Ocean, stretching from Singapore to India, Dubai, 
and parts of eastern Africa, are home to half of  
the best­performing banks in the world. In other 
geographies, many banks buoyed by recent 

1   This reflects a long­term trend. For example, investors sometimes find more attractive opportunities to park incremental cash flows into money 
market funds (rather than bank deposit products). Or borrowers find it more attractive to take credit from nonbanks. This report is not referring 
to the current US deposit dynamics, which has resulted in outflows for banks as well as shifts within the composition of banks’ balance sheet

and the United States, as well as in China and 
Russia, banks overall have struggled to generate 
their cost of capital. 

One aspect of banking hasn’t changed, however: 
the price­to­book ratio, which was at 0.9 in 2022. 
This measure has remained flat since the 2008 
financial crisis and stands at a historic gap to the 
rest of the economy—a reflection that capital 
markets expect the return on equity to remain below 
the cost of equity. While the price­to­book ratio 
reflects some of the long­term systematic challenges 
the sector is facing, it also suggests the possible 
upside: every 0.1­times improvement in the price­
to­book ratio would cause the sector’s value added 
to increase by more than $1 trillion. 

Looking to the future, the outlook for financial 
institutions is likely to be shaped by four global trends 
in particular. First, the macroeconomic environment 
has shifted substantially, with higher interest rates 
and inflation figures in many parts of the world, as well 
as a possible deceleration of Chinese economic 
growth. An unusually broad range of outcomes is 
suddenly possible, suggesting we may be on the 
cusp of a new macroeconomic era. Second, techno­
logical progress continues to accelerate, and 
customers are increasingly comfortable with—and 
demanding about—technology­driven experiences. 
In particular, the emergence of generative AI could 
be a game changer, lifting productivity by 3 to  
5 percent and enabling a reduction in operating 
expenditures of between $200 billion and  
$300 billion, according to our estimates. Third, 
governments are broadening and deepening 
regulatory scrutiny of nontraditional financial 
institutions and intermediaries as the macroeconomic 
system comes under stress and new technologies, 
players, and risks emerge. For example, recently 
published proposals for a final Basel III “endgame” 
would result in higher capital requirements for  
large and medium­size banks. And fourth, systemic 
risk is shifting in nature as rising geopolitical 
tensions increase volatility and spur trade and 
investment restrictions in the real economy. 

In this context, the future dynamics of the Great 
Banking Transition are critical for the banking sector 
overall. Evidence of the transition and associated 
unbundling abound. In the United States, 75 percent 
of the net increase in financial funds ended up off 
banking balance sheets, while in Europe, the figure 
is about 55 percent. Private debt, meanwhile, saw 
its highest inflows in 2022, with growth of 29 percent, 
driven by direct lending. Beyond the balance sheet, 
transactions including payments and trading 
activities are also shifting: consumer digital payment 
processing conducted by payments specialists 
grew by more than 50 percent between 2015 and 
2022, for example. 

The oscillating interest rate environment will affect 
the Great Banking Transition, but exactly how remains 
to be seen. The industry may be going through a 
phase in which a long­term macroeconomic turning 
point—including a higher­for­longer interest rate 
scenario and an end to the asset price super cycle—
changes the attractiveness of some models that 
were specifically geared to the old environment, 
while other structural trends, especially in technology, 
continue. Fundamentally, the question for banks is 
to what extent they can offer the products that 
people are looking for, at a time when risk capacity 
is broadening and many are searching for the 
highest deposit yields.

Regardless of the macroeconomic developments, 
all financial institutions will have to adjust and adapt 
to the changing environment of the Great Banking 
Transition, especially the trends of technology, 
regulation, risk, and scale. Mergers and acquisitions 
may gain importance. 

As financial institutions consider how they want to 
change, we outline five priorities, which are neither 
comprehensive nor mutually exclusive, as thought 
starters. These are the five priorities:

1.  Exploiting technology and AI to boost 

productivity, utilize talent better, and improve 
the delivery of products and services. This 
includes capturing the AI opportunity, along 

4

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transitionwith advanced analytics, to deploy process 
automation, platforms, and ecosystems; 
operating more like a tech company to scale 
the delivery of products and services; 
cultivating a cloud­based, platform­oriented 
architecture; and improving capabilities  
to address technology risks. Distinctive 
technology development and deployment will 
increasingly become a critical differentiator  
for banks.

2.  Flexing and even unbundling the balance  

sheet. Flexing implies active use of syndication, 
originate­to­distribute models, third­party 
balance sheets (for example, as part of banking­
as­a­service applications), and a renewed focus 
on deposits. Unbundling, which can be done  
to varying degrees and in stages, pushes this 
concept further and can mean separating  
out customer­facing businesses from banking­
as­a­service businesses and using technology 
to radically restructure costs.

3.  Scaling or exiting transaction businesses. Scale 
in a market or product is a key to success, but it 
can be multifaceted: institutions can find a niche 
in which to go deep, or they can look to cover  
an entire market. Banks can aggressively pursue 
economies of scale in their transactions 
business, including through M&A (which has 
been a major differentiator between traditional 
banks and specialists) or by leveraging  
partners to help with exits.

4.  Leveling up distribution to sell to customers  

and advise them directly and indirectly, including 
through embedded finance and marketplaces 
and by offering digital and AI­based advisories. 
An integrated omnichannel approach here  
could make the most of automation and human 
interaction, for example. Deciding on a strategy 
for third­party distribution, which could be  
via partnerships to create embedded finance 
opportunities or platform­based models,  
can create opportunities to serve customer 
needs, including with products outside the 
institution’s immediate business models.

5.  Adapting to changing risks. Financial 

institutions everywhere will need to stay on top 
of the ever­evolving risk environment. In the 
macroeconomic context, this includes inflation, 
an unclear growth outlook, and potential  
credit challenges in specific sectors such as 
commercial real estate exposure. Other risks  
are associated with changing regulatory 
requirements, cyber and fraud, and the 
integration of advanced analytics and AI into  
the banking system. To manage these risks, 
banks could consider elevating the risk function 
to make it a potential differentiator. For example, 
in client discussions, product design, and 
communications, they could highlight the bank’s 
resilience based on its track record of managing 
systemic risk and liquidity. They could also 
further strengthen the first line and embed risk 
in day­to­day activities, including investing in 
new risk activities driven by the growth of gen AI. 
Underlying changes in the real economy will 
continue in unexpected ways, requiring banks  
to be ever more vigilant.

All these priorities have critical implications for 
financial institutions’ capital plans, including the 
more active raising and return of capital. As  
financial institutions reexamine their businesses 
and identify their relative competitive advantages  
in each of the balance sheet, transactions, and 
distribution components, they will need to ensure 
that they are positioned to generate adequate 
returns. And they will need to do so in a different 
macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and 
at a time when AI and other technologies are 
potentially changing the game and with a broader 
set of competitors. Scale and specialization  
will be determinative, as will value­creating 
diversification. Minimum economies of scale are 
also likely to shift, especially where technology  
and data are the drivers of scale. The years ahead 
will likely be more dynamic than the immediate  
past, with the gap between leaders and laggards 
increasing even more. Now is the time to begin 
charting the path forward.

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transition1

The highest highs, 
the lowest lows

A year ago, in our 2022 Global Banking Annual 
Review, we focused on how the world of banking 
was entering a period of sudden volatility after  
years of relative stability. We warned that this could 
increase the industry’s fragility and exacerbate 
growing divergences between types of banks, 
business models, and geographies.2

Sure enough, the past 18 months have been a time 
of extremes for the banking industry globally— 
but the news is far from being all bad. While we have 

seen the lowest of lows in some financial institu­
tions and in some places, we have also seen the 
highest of highs. On a global basis, key indicators for 
the industry, including return on equity (ROE) and 
capital ratios, have risen after long periods of 
decline. For some banks in Europe and the United 
States, 2022 and the first half of 2023 have been  
the best in more than a decade, as higher interest 
rates lifted revenue and ended a painful years­ 
long trend of margin compression.

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionIndeed, both traditional and nontraditional banks in 
any and every geography are proving that it is 
possible to grow, thrive, and excite customers through 
reinvention and innovation. For example, one of  
the most radiant of these spots is in countries 
forming a crescent around the Indian Ocean, where 
half the world’s best­performing banks are now  
to be found.

Moreover, new technological developments, including 
gen AI and faster computer processing power and 
cloud architecture, are raising hopes and aspirations 
for massive productivity­enhancing and potentially 
game­changing solutions to age­old issues. 

But the lows cannot be overlooked. One of Europe’s 
oldest banks and some of the highest­profile midsize 
banks in the United States collapsed or had to be 
rescued; both the Swiss National Bank and the US 
federal government needed to step in to backstop 
consumer deposits. Star performers in previous 
years, including fintechs, have struggled. Crypto­
currencies are sorting through a host of problems 
after the collapse of key players. And financial 
institutions as a whole continue to trade below their 
book value, suggesting that market participants 
believe they will collectively continue to have an 
ROE that is below their cost of capital, as is currently 
the case for more than half of banking institutions, 
especially those with higher capital intensity and 
those that are more global in nature and deemed to 
be systemically important by regulators.3

Why can’t most of banking, especially the balance­
sheet­based part, shake out of its valuation and 
value creation rut? And to what extent could the big 
interest rate rises of the past year be a game 
changer, both for banks with business models that 
have been under pressure and for those that did 
well when capital was cheap? In this year’s review, 
we take a closer look at one of the most important 
underlying factors that can shed light on these 
questions: the shifts in balance sheets, transactions, 
and distribution that have been leaving banks to  
go to nontraditional institutions and other parts of 

the market, a movement we are calling the Great 
Banking Transition. While disintermediation has 
been happening for a nearly a decade, especially in 
transactions,4 it has achieved a critical mass for the 
balance sheet, with distribution potentially to follow. 
The traditional model of capital­heavy banking still 
needs to reinvent itself to ensure its own future—
and to do so swiftly. And how will the combination of 
significantly higher interest rates—after an extended 
period of depressed rates for much of the developed 
world—and other trends (including regulatory and 
technology changes) both challenge and accelerate 
key assumptions about the future?

The Great Banking Transition is the main theme  
of this year’s annual review. In chapter 2, we focus 
on how balance sheets, transactions, and some 
distribution channels have been moving away from 
traditional players, while in chapter 3, we consider 
strategies for banks seeking to adjust to changing 
realities and to find new sources for value creation.  
As we do every year, we start in chapter 1 with  
an analysis of major developments in the banking 
sector globally over the past year; these  
include some of the trends contributing to the  
Great Transition. 

A long-awaited upturn in net interest 
and profit margins
Banks, especially in Europe and North America, 
registered gains in net interest margins in 2022 on 
the back of rising interest rates, leading to a rise in 
their ROE, and the trend continued into 2023. In the 
United States and Europe, net interest margins rose 
by between 15 and 80 basis points, depending on 
the profile of each financial institution’s portfolio, with 
an average gain of 22 basis points. Many financial 
institutions across key segments—including 
payments, wealth and asset management, capital 
markets, and consumer finance—continue to go 
from strength to strength.5 However, wide variations 
exist within these individual subsectors. A return  
to ultralow spreads seems unlikely in the short term, 
but the outlook for net margins remains uncertain.

3 We define banks in this report to include all financial institutions except insurance companies.
4 We define transaction in this report to include any asset or trade movement, be it an equity or an electronic payment.
5 Capital markets refers to the businesses of investment banking, sales and trading, and market infrastructure.

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionOverall, the best years for ROE in more  
than a decade
Taken as a whole, 2022 and 2023 have been the 
best years for banks’ ROE in more than a decade, 
though with considerable variation between 
institutions. Viewed globally, the ROE for financial 
institutions rose to 12 percent in 2022 and looks  
set to reach 13 percent in 2023. That is far above the 
13­year ROE average of 9.1 percent (Exhibit 1).  

Net income for the sector of $1.4 trillion in 2023 was 
double the net income posted in 2017. The ROE 
increase was even accompanied by an increase in 
capital ratios, with the Tier 1 ratio globally reaching 
13.8 percent in 2022–23, the highest in a decade.

The banking sector also continued its journey of 
continuous cost improvement: the cost­income ratio 
dropped by seven percentage points (partially

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionThe global figures mask wide variations 
within individual subsectors. Some 
financial institutions across markets 
have created strong shareholder value, 
premium ROE, strong growth in 
earnings, and above-average P/E and P/B 
multiples, while others lag behind.

driven by margin changes), and the trend was also 
visible in the cost­per­asset ratio (which declined 
from 1.6 to 1.5). 

The financial services sector globally intermediated 
about $400 trillion in assets and generated  
$6.8 trillion in revenue in 2022. Those are both 
records. They compare with about $375 trillion  
in assets and $6.4 trillion in revenue generated in 
2021. Intermediation has been growing faster than 
the overall economy, with intermediation growth  
of about 6 percent annually on average since 2017, 
compared with real GDP growth of about 3 percent.

Looking at these data in a more granular way 
highlights wide variations that continue to grow 
across the industry. Intermediation revenues  
were largely concentrated in corporate, commercial, 
and retail banking, as has been the usual pattern. 
The most profitable sectors were wealth and asset 
management, capital markets infrastructure, and 
payments (Exhibit 2).

In wealth and asset management, the gap between 
the best and the rest has been widening since 2019, 
but overall costs have risen industry­wide. Asset 
managers, in particular, saw declines in profitability 
and growth in 2022, mainly due to negative equity 
and bond performance. 

In capital markets, revenue pools continue to  
grow on the buy side—that is, firms buying financial 
securities, including pension funds, investment 
managers, and hedge funds. On the sell side (firms 
including corporations, advisory firms, and invest­
ment banks selling, issuing, or trading in financial 
securities), revenues remained stagnant. The share 
of intermediation revenue accordingly declined  
by one percentage point to $480 billion.

In retail banking, the push to embrace new 
technologies has seen the emergence of some 
banks operating with the efficiencies of tech 
companies. Distribution is moving increasingly from 
omnichannel to fully mobile channels.

In corporate and commercial banking, where the 
share of intermediation revenue rose by more than 
two percentage points in 2022 from the previous 
year, higher interest rates are improving the margins 
on transaction banking, despite a slowdown in 
corporate deal volumes since 2021. 

Finally, in payments, global revenues continue to 
see rapid growth, especially in Asia. The shift to 
contactless, digital payments is accelerating, and 
the demand for embedded finance is growing in 
deposits, payment issuing, and lending.6

6  Embedded finance arises from partnerships between banks, technology providers, and distributors of financial products to embed financial 
products into nonfinancial platforms. For more, see Andy Dresner, Albion Murati, Brian Pike, and Jonathan Zell, “Embedded finance: Who will 
lead the next payments revolution?,” McKinsey, October 13, 2022.

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionThe global figures tell only part of the story; they 
mask wide variations within individual subsectors. 
Some financial institutions across markets have 
created strong shareholder value, premium ROE, 
strong growth in earnings, and above­average 
price­to­earnings and price­to­book multiples, while 
others lag behind. For example, while more than  
40 percent of payments providers have an ROE above 
14 percent, almost 35 percent have an ROE below  
8 percent. Among wealth and asset managers, which 
typically have margins of about 30 percent, more 
than one­third have ROEs above 14 percent, while 
more than 40 percent have ROEs below 8 percent 
(Exhibit 3). Such variations indicate the extent to 
which opera tional excellence and decisions relating 
to cost, efficiency, customer retention, capital 
allocation, and other issues affecting performance 

are more important than ever for banking. The 
strongest performers tend to use the balance sheet 
effectively, are customer­centric, are effective 
managers, and often lead on technology usage.

Disruptions kept the sector trading below book 
value, with exceptions
Banking was affected by disruptions, and the sector 
as a whole continues to trade below book value. 
However, there are some notable bright spots. 

Several major disruptions in 2022 and 2023 
contributed to the high degree of variance in banks’ 
performance. Some of the disruptions related  
to geopolitical situations; among these, the conse­
quences of Russia’s war on Ukraine have included 
energy supply concerns and sanctions on Russia that

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transitionaffect Russian banks and non­Russian companies 
doing business in Russia. In the economic sphere, 
surging inflation and rapid increases in interest rates 
caught some banks by surprise and contributed  
to some US regional banking failures. The crypto­
currency market, buoyant in previous years, was 
shaken by the collapse of several leading players, 
along with regulatory changes in the United  
States and elsewhere.7

Amid both the upturn in margins and the volatility 
from these disruptions, one aspect of banking has 
remained constant: the sector’s price­to­book ratio 
(P/B). At 0.9 in 2022, it has remained largely flat 
since the 2008 financial crisis (Exhibit 4). Banking  
is the sector with the lowest market valuation, 
suggesting that capital markets expect that ROE over 

time will remain below the cost of equity. But as we 
describe in more detail in the following chapter, the 
outlook varies considerably depending on whether 
the current interest rate environment endures, and 
for how long, and whether an institution is balance 
sheet heavy (as traditional universal banks are) or 
asset light (as, for example, in the case of wealth  
and asset managers).

Depressed P/Bs and price­to­earnings ratios (P/Es) 
suggest there may be significant upside: if the 
sector finds a path to a more future­proof business 
model, trillions of dollars in shareholder value could 
be created. This, in turn, could also increase the 
sector’s stability. Still, it is important to note that 
expectations for value creation in banking should 
take into account that balance sheet banking is a

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transitionleveraged business driven by macroeconomic 
developments. Any bank’s long­term success  
will predominantly depend on prudent through­
cycle steering. 

In last year’s Global Banking Annual Review, we 
noted that banks globally fall into three different 
categories. First were the “North Stars,” which 
performed well in terms of both high returns today 
and future growth, with high P/Es implying high 
expectations for long­term growth and high P/Bs 
reflecting risk­adjusted profitability. Second,  
about half of the 1,000 largest banks globally had 
ROEs below their cost of equity and were  
expected to continue doing so in the future. The 
remaining 35 percent—banks with high P/Bs  
but low P/Es—were creating value but not growing 
sufficiently to ensure they would continue  
doing so.8

The divergence among the three categories has 
grown in the past year. In 2022, 15 percent of 
institutions were North Stars; that share declined to 
12 percent in 2023. The share of banks expected to 
have ROE below the cost of equity rose to 58 percent 
in 2023 from 50 percent in 2022. And 32 percent of 
banks fell into the category of those profitable today 
but with longer­term challenges of value creation, 
down from 35 percent in 2022.

More broadly, the banking industry continues to face 
competition from nonincumbents, including 
specialist players that are less constrained by legacy 
systems and cost overhang and can move faster than 
traditional banks. Since the global financial crisis  
in 2008, the industry’s ROE has been below the cost 
of equity, partly as a consequence of regulatory 
requirements in many countries (Exhibit 5).

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionGlobal trends bring a new outlook for 
financial institutions
Several global trends contributing to a more volatile 
world underlie the market highs, many examples  
of success, and previously described sources of 
disruption. They are also contributing to the Great 
Banking Transition we discuss in the next chapter. 
Four trends in particular contribute and will likely 
continue contributing to shifting outcomes for 
financial institutions: the uneven macroeconomic 
outlook, tighter regulation and government 
supervision, technology disruption, and systemic 
risk. Compared to the past, technology and macro­
economics in particular have shifted substantially—
and likely for the longer term.

These four trends and others are affecting the 
industry with increased velocity. A high degree of 
connectivity—propelled by technological innovation 
and underpinned by economic interdependencies—
has increased communication and mobility and the 
speed of innovation in industry. Today’s connectivity 
can also contribute to disruptions, as when  
social media acts as a vector for both information 
and misinformation about the health of banks.  
The resulting flood of communications contributed 
to the turbulence that shook US regional banks  
in the first half of 2023.

Uneven macroeconomic outlook
Growth and inflation expectations vary widely 
across geographies, and there is continuing 
concern about volatility and the prospect that the 

global economy may be entering a new era with 
widely divergent outcomes.9 The range of plausible 
long­term paths remains wide. Much depends on 
whether the world returns to an era of weak invest­
ment and a glut of savings, entailing slow GDP 
growth, low interest rates, and unabated expansion 
of the global balance sheet. On another path, 
stronger consumption and higher investment 
require ments for the net­zero transition, supply chain 
reconfiguration, or defense could lead to persistently 
higher inflation and interest rates.10

Over the past 18 months, central banks in areas with 
high inflation have been raising interest rates faster 
than in recent history (Exhibit 6). Projections for  
the medium­term outlook depend fundamentally  
on what happens to interest rates, with several 
scenarios possible. While the economy could 
potentially revert to the low­interest­rate environ­
ment of the past two decades, another scenario  
is for rates to stay at relatively elevated levels for 
longer amid continued inflation concerns. For  
banks and the broader economy, the scenario that 
unfolds will be decisive. A prolonged period of  
high interest rates would ripple through the entire 
economy, likely dampening growth and affecting  
the housing market, consumer spending, job 
creation, and more. This also implies an increase  
in the cost of equity across the industry.

For now, there appears to be a sense of stabilization 
and cautious optimism about the short­term outlook.

GDP growth at about 3 percent in 2023 and 2024, 
in part because of improved sentiment in developing 
countries, and talk of a deeper recession in the 
United States and Europe has mostly dissipated. 
Indeed, for the first time in more than a year, global 
executives are now more positive than negative 
about conditions in the global economy. In the latest 
McKinsey global survey on economic conditions, 

published in July 2023, respondents overall express 
an evolving perspective on the interest rate 
environment, with many saying rate levels may have 
peaked or could soon do so.11 The survey nonetheless 
highlights significant geographic divergence. 
Respondents in Europe, India, and North America 
were more optimistic about economic conditions  
in their home countries than they were six months 

11 “Economic conditions outlook during turbulent times, June 2023,” McKinsey, July 7, 2023.

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transitionago, whereas pessimism is growing in the Asia–
Pacific region, especially China. In China, which long 
served as an engine for global growth, the economy 
has slowed: average annual GDP growth between 
2021 and 2023 has been about 4 percent, substan­
tially lower than the average 7 percent growth 
between 2012 and 2019.12

Tighter regulation and government supervision
As the macroeconomic system comes under stress 
and new technologies, players, and risks emerge, 
global governments are broadening and deepening 
regulatory oversight of financial intermediaries. 
Existing coverage has been tightened in some areas. 
For example, recently published proposals for a final 
Basel III “endgame” could change the calculation  
of risk­weighted assets, potentially leading to signif­
i cant increases in the capital requirements of large 
banks. The US Federal Reserve Board estimates that 
the proposals would result in an aggregate 16 percent 
increase in common equity Tier 1 capital require­
ments for affected bank holding companies.13 The 
Basel III endgame also proposes new standards  
to manage credit, market, and operational risk for 
financial institutions and greater scrutiny of liquidity 
requirements.14 The growing adoption of open 
banking, which enables the sharing of financial data 
between banks and third­party service providers, 
has led to more calls for data protection and increased 
regulation in several geographies.15 Moreover, a 
growing swath of environmental, social, and gover­
nance (ESG) requirements are being introduced 
across industries, including banking, and in many 
countries, notably in Europe.16 Finally, regulatory 
coverage is slowly expanding to newer areas, 
including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies 
and to nonbanking financial intermediaries such  
as private capital funds and hedge funds. There also 
is increasing scrutiny of fast payments.

Regulatory change is unlikely to decelerate and may 
also begin to encompass new and nontraditional 
business models. One of the outcomes of these and 
other regulatory moves has been to accelerate and 
deepen the Great Banking Transition, as we discuss 
in chapter 2.

Technology disruption
Technology has increasingly become a competitive 
advantage in financial institutions, with the most 
digitally advanced often performing the best. Leading 
digital banks deploy personalization analytics and 
digital marketing campaigns to bring relevant offers 
to (potential) clients. They create an omnichannel 
experience where branch and contact center 
professionals have the tools and data to support 
customers at any stage of the sales journey. They 
also provide customer approvals in real time  
using automated credit­risk decisioning. At the back 
end of the process, they drive client self­servicing 
through well­designed digital workflows enabled by 
a modern data architecture.17 New entrants, 
including fintechs, have reaped the benefits of their 
technological edge in recent years, although  
they have struggled in the past 18 months. Rapid 
technological advancement in application program­
ming interfaces (APIs), cloud, and tokenization, as 
well as in data and analytics, has contributed to 
improved cost structures. As financial institutions roll 
out new business models that include embedded 
finance and cross­sectional platforms, the client 
experience has continued to improve. 

With gen AI now emerging on the scene over the 
past year, a new wave of technological innovation is 
likely to ensue (see sidebar “Generative AI and 
banking”). Large language models that underpin 
this fast­growing technology could provide a 
significant productivity boost and mark a potentially

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionGenerative AI and banking

Every few years, new technologies emerge 
that generate excitement in the banking 
community, though many of them do not 
become transformational. However, AI— 
especially its recent iteration, gen AI—has 
the potential to truly change the shape  
of banking models.

Gen AI could be different for three main 
reasons. First, it could bring about a 
quantum leap not just in productivity but 
also in customer experience. Second, in  
its latest forms, it has a relatively low barrier 
to entry, which can enable even smaller 
financial institutions and start­ups to quickly 
test and roll out many different use cases. 
And third, a significant part of gen AI’s 
impact happens in the back and middle 
offices, which makes it harder to copy  
and could enable individual banks to build 
a competitive edge in use cases. In that 
sense, it may become possible to rewire a 
bank in a way that is not easily visible to  
the outside world—something most new 
technologies haven’t been able to do.

Given its potential uses, gen AI should be 
viewed not only as a technology issue but 
also as a deep strategy issue, requiring a 
CEO­level approach on the where and how 
to deploy it. Financial institutions seeking 
to deploy it will need a high metabolism 
rate coupled with a clearly defined risk 
appetite and controls. Banks may want to 
begin this journey with a purpose­built  
gen AI framework, including considera­
tions on risk and control.

The technology has numerous applications. 
Through its ability to generate content, 
possibly while taking context or 

instructions into account, gen AI can 
personalize the creation and editing of 
images, audio, and video. The coherent 
passages of text it is able to construct can 
be used in numerous chat­like customer 
service applications. It can predict or extract 
information from unstructured data, 
enabling it to synthesize, answer questions, 
and reason about text, images, and 
multimodal data. Finally, it can search and 
extract key information about topics. 

Some caveats are important. Gen AI is still 
relatively novel and not yet suited for some 
applications. It remains prone to errors and 
factual inaccuracy, or invention (known  
as “hallucinations”), and its value judgments 
are largely untested. For now, it is not 
suitable in high­stakes scenarios for which 
any of these flaws could cause harm  
or where verification or substantiation  
is difficult to provide in the moment.  
That means it still needs to improve before 
being used in regulatory interactions, 
among others.

Gen AI nonetheless has the potential to 
level up the entire end­to­end banking 
value chain and relieve pressure on the 
talent pipeline across many functions:

 — In marketing and sales, it will be able  

to automatically create hyper­
personalized content tailored to each 
customer, based on their profile, 
behavior, and banking history. It may 
find uses as a frontline assistant, 
conducting industry research and 
proposal preparation for commercial 
and investment banks or playing a role 
in analysis of wealth portfolios.

 — In operations, gen AI can improve 

existing service chatbots to provide 
personalized, efficient, and accurate 
responses to customer queries. It 
could accelerate and improve tasks 
such as interpreting or writing technical 
documents such as loan contracts, 
requests for proposal, account plans, 
and third­pillar or environmental,  
social, and governance reports. A high 
level of accuracy will be necessary 
before broader adoption, especially for 
these sensitive usages.

 — In technology, it could accelerate the 
transition from legacy software and 
code to more modern systems. One of 
its compelling features is an ability  
to improve productivity and accelerate 
the development of software, through 
use of gen­AI­based coding assistants 
such as GitHub Copilot.

 — Finally, for legal, risk, and compliance, 
gen AI can automatically create risk 
reports such as model documentation, 
credit memos, or suspicious­activity 
reports, as well as generating lifelike 
fraud attempts for proactive testing. 

As with all new technologies, challenges 
are sure to arise on the journey to deploy­
ment of gen AI. But if the efforts can lead 
to higher productivity, more efficient 
operations, greater innovation, and help 
change the core relationship between 
banks and their customers, they may  
be worthwhile. 

17

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transitionsignificant inflection point. Recent McKinsey 
research looking at more than 60 use cases of gen 
AI across sectors has estimated that the technology 
could potentially reduce between $200 billion  
and $300 billion in operating expenditures in the 
banking sector and boost productivity by about  
3 to 5 percent. The largest impacts could potentially 
be felt in marketing and sales, customer operations, 
investment servicing, software engineering, and  
risk and legal.18

Systemic risk
Although cross­border flows of goods, services, 
people, and data continue to characterize the global 
economy, rising geopolitical tensions, the growth  
of trade restrictions, and black­swan events such as 
the COVID-19 pandemic have increased volatility 
and added new and sometimes large­scale risks.19 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, for example, prompted 
price volatility on energy markets and concerns  
in some countries about energy supply and security. 
The ensuing sanctions imposed by the United 
States, European countries, and some others on 
Russian institutions and individuals, in turn, created 

new pressures for Russia’s economy and on inter­
national companies doing business there. The 
Geopolitical Risk Index reached a ten­year high  
in 2022 as a result of that conflict and remains 
above its COVID-19 levels.20 Trade tensions have 
heightened broadly, not only related to the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine but also to decoupling between 
the United States and China and their respective 
allies. The number of trade restrictions imposed since 
the global financial crisis has risen fivefold, with  
a consistent uptick since 2020, and the number of 
investment restrictions increased in 2022 by the 
most on a year­to­year basis in the past 15 years.21

Other trends
These four trends are not exhaustive. Another shift 
affecting financial institutions is changing customer 
preferences, with bank customers increasingly 
drawn to hybrid and digital service offerings that are 
personalized and customized for their needs and 
thus add convenience. In addition, there are structural 
shifts in lending demands, including rising impor­
tance of more lending­light sectors including 
services, as well as the growth of sustainable finance 

The trends are affecting the industry 
with increased velocity. A high degree of 
connectivity, propelled by technological 
innovation and underpinned by 
economic interdependencies, has 
increased communication and mobility 
and the speed of innovation.

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transitionand infrastructure financing, which we discussed  
at length in last year’s Global Banking Annual Review. 
On the corporate side, as companies get larger and 
more complex, they have needs that only sophis­
ticated banks are equipped to meet. Lastly, ESG will 
continue to evolve and drive much change. One 
example is the issuance of sustainable bonds, 
including green bonds, sustainability bonds, social 
bonds, and sustainability­linked bonds, which  
rose to $1.06 trillion in 2021 from almost zero, five 
years previously. Issuance declined in 2022  
but resumed in 2023 and is forecast to return to 
$900 billion to $1 trillion.22

Impact on the banking sector
These trends are playing out across the banking 
sector in different ways. We observe impact  
on long­term profitability, economic profits,  
and revenues.

Long-term profitability under pressure
The long­term pressure on profits is primarily 
affecting balance­sheet­heavy banks. Despite 
recent positive performance, our analysis suggests 
that the long­term contraction of global banking 
margins and ROE may resume, subject to the longer­
term outlook for interest rates. Gains in net interest 
income could be short­lived and interest margins 
could decline again if and when interest rate hikes 
slow and ultimately reverse. Fee margins could  
also decline if the economy softens, and the 
uncertain economic outlook—despite the first signs 
of optimism—weighs on risk costs (Exhibit 7). 
Moreover, the recently published proposals for a 
Basel III endgame are still under discussion,  
but the require ments to increase Tier 1 capital could 
substantially affect banks.23 We estimate these 
proposals could have the most pronounced impact 
on banks that rely on fee­based businesses, such  
as credit cards and wealth and asset management,

be major product impacts, including in such areas  
as trade finance. 

Economic profits are diverging among  
business models
Banking globally generates about $1 trillion of 
accounting profit every year, one of the highest 
figures among industries, with retail and wholesale 
banking being the latest contributors (Exhibit 8). 
Banking has generated these after­tax profits even 
with the turbulence from COVID-19, global supply 
chain disruptions, and the recent surge in inflation  

in advanced economies. At the same time, banks  
have a notional cost of capital that amounts  
to about $1.2 trillion and exceeds the level of 
accounting profit.24

Among financial institutions, value creation diverges 
widely among business models and products— 
for example, corporate banking and wealth asset 
management—given the impact of economies  
of scale, regulation and associated capital 
requirements, and barriers to entry. Markets tend  
to reward sectors that create value, but with  
few nuances.

24  The banking sector employs about $12 trillion in equity for doing business, with a cost of equity of about 10 percent, meaning investors in the 

sector would expect a minimum of $1.2 trillion in profits in return.

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionWhile all subsectors had positive earnings growth 
on average, subsectors differ widely in their  
ability to create economic and shareholder value. 
For example, payments companies have had  
both strong earnings­per­share (EPS) growth and 
value creation, whereas the value of mid­tier  
banks has contracted despite higher EPS growth 
(Exhibits 9a and 9b).

Revenues shifting by geography
Though much ink was spilled in previous years on 
the ascendance of the so­called BRICS—Brazil, 
Russia, India, China, and South Africa—the 
geography of banking continues to shift, but not 
necessarily to the BRICS. Banking sectors in  
Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa 
are growing revenue faster as a whole than those

in developed markets, and this trend is expected to 
continue over the coming years (Exhibit 10). In 
2022–23, for example, the Middle East and Africa 
saw revenue jump by 11 percent, almost doubling  
the region’s average annual banking revenue growth 
in 2016–22.

As we noted in last year’s annual review, lumping 
together financial institutions in developing 

economies under the title of emerging­market banks 
is misleading, since the performance of banks can 
diverge substantially (see sidebar “China’s banking 
sector faces tighter times”).

A notable aspect of this broader move to a concen­
tration of global banking growth in specific 
geographic pockets is the dynamism of financial 
institutions in economies around the Indian

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transitionservice delivery models; in other words, the area has 
become a testing ground for a deeper reinvention  
of banking.

One of the most significant consequences of these 
global trends is a deep and growing rift in the banking 
sector between core banking functions that use  
the traditional balance sheet to maintain customer 
loyalty and more capital­light parts of the business. 
While the core banking services struggle to have  

an ROE above their cost of capital, the latter tend to 
create the most value. This structural and funda­
mental shift in the market manifests in the continued 
move of funds toward nontraditional players and 
parts of the market. The trend is not new but has 
gathered pace, moving the banking sector to  
a tipping point. The following chapter examines this 
movement of funds—the Great Banking Transition, 
which could mark the sector’s near­ and longer­
term future, depending on the trajectory of interest 
rates and the macro economic outlook. 

China’s banking sector faces tighter times

China has the largest banking balance 
sheet in the world, with unique challenges 
and opportunities. Many of the global 
trends identified in this report translate to 
China differently. For example, while much 
of the rest of the world has high inflation, 
China is facing potential deflation. 

Traditional universal banks in China are 
among the world’s largest but continue to 
face challenges with a high level of 
nonperforming loans. As we noted in last 
year’s Global Banking Annual Review, 
substantial strain is coming from a real 
estate overhang. In August 2023, the 
Evergrande Group, China’s biggest real 
estate company, filed for bankruptcy 
protection, and some other large real 
estate companies are facing challenges.1 
Major Chinese banks are currently  
trading at 0.5 times their book value, with 
limited prospects for achieving ROE  
higher than the cost of equity in 2023. 

Declines in real estate values are influencing 
retail consumption as well as provincial 

debt levels and budget deficits. These 
challenges require banks to explore  
cost­saving opportunities, which they are 
doing with a combination of large­scale 
sophisticated digitization and, in some 
cases, salary adjustments. Ultimately 
government ownership gives these banks 
an extra layer of protection.

also tightened fintech regulations, 
including rules governing the financial 
aspects of super apps, such as Ant 
Financial. Banks themselves continue to 
play a vital role in promoting overarching 
growth. Increasing levels of risk manage­
ment in the sector will remain a priority to 
maintain customer confidence.

Major opportunities remain. Chinese 
banks have already shown their capacity to 
benefit from the rise of digital technologies, 
which puts them in a strong position to 
leverage the growth of AI. Chinese banks 
can continue to play a key role in funding 
infrastructure and development projects. 
And as incomes rise and more people gain 
access to the financial system, including 
through mobile apps, new opportunities 
will emerge for wealth management, rural 
finance, and cross­border banking. 

Many issues Western banks are facing now 
have already been a reality in China for 
decades. These include the success of large 
platforms in customer ownership and 
business model innovation. In the face of 
the current sectoral and economic 
corrections, the government is regulating 
the shadow banking system differently.  
For example, almost all of China’s peer­to­
peer lending platforms have been closed.2

Attempts to modernize the financial sector 
continue apace, including the recent 
creation of a National Administration for 
Financial Regulation.3 The government  
has shown willingness to experiment, 
including with the digital yuan. But it has

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transition2

The great banking 
transition

In a story that has been developing for several years, 
assets and clients have been flowing from traditional 
financial institutions that are capital heavy, such  
as universal banks, to nontraditional institutions that 
are capital­light. The latter include payments systems, 
financial data, and infrastructure businesses, stand­
alone wealth and asset managers, private capital 
and equity business, and fintechs. While the growth 
of assets under manage ment outside of banks’ 
balance sheets is not new, it merits attention now 
because, according to our analysis, the traditional 

core of the banking sector—the balance sheet—is at 
a tipping point: the flow has attained a scale that  
can fundamentally alter the nature of the financial 
services industry. Besides the impact on the 
balance sheet, this transition will reshape the other 
two pillars of banking: transactions and distribution. 
Underlying these shifts—both enabling and 
accelerating the transition—is technological innova­
tion, which makes it possible to scale up delivery 
and reduce costs.

26

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionBanks are under pressure from this movement, but 
everywhere there are opportunities, as we outline in 
the next chapter. The sharp increases in interest 
rates over the past year raise key questions about 
which Great Banking Transition business models  
will accelerate and which will reverse. Capital­heavy 
business models that have been losing out over  
the past years work much better when there are real 
spreads, as seen in the resurgence of profitability 
outlined in the previous chapter. But interest rates 
are just one factor in the Great Banking Transition. 
Much will depend on the economic scenario  
that unfolds.

Financial institutions will want to consider each of 
their businesses to assess where their competitive 
advantages lie across the three areas of balance 
sheet, transactions, and distribution. And they will 
need to do so in a world in which technology and  
AI will play an even more prominent role, and against 
the backdrop of a shifting macroeconomic environ­
ment and heightened geopolitical risks.

How the transition affects banking 
Regardless of what happens next, including 
changes in the credit environment, the Great 
Banking Transition is very real, very large,  
and very tangible. It has been affecting three key 
pillars of banking: the balance sheet, transactions, 
and distribution.

From banking balance sheet to off balance sheet 
As clients and customers search for higher returns, 
lower capital funding, or better matching durations 
of the assets, financial assets have been growing 
and migrating out of the bank balance sheet—that is, 
away from corporate and retail deposits, bank 
bonds, and other liabilities and equity—and into 
non banks, or off­balance­sheet vehicles such  
as public pension funds, digital assets, private 
capital, alternative investments, insurance  
and pension assets under management, and other 
institutional assets under management. This  
is most visible in the shift from bank deposits to 
money market funds.

Regardless of what happens next,  
the Great Banking Transition is very 
real, very large, and very tangible.  
It has been affecting three key pillars of 
banking: the balance sheet, transactions, 
and distribution.

27

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionBank assets are also leaving banks for reasons 
related to business models or client service. 
Customers may find that other institutions can take 
more risk, better match durations and risk appetite, 
have lower­cost or stickier funding, are subject  
to different regulation, or don’t have depositors  
to protect. For example, private credit has been 
growing rapidly. With regard to service, some 
institutions are better able to meet client needs, 
including with technology, products, and services 
that resonate more with clients and customers.

The shift from balance sheet to off balance sheet 
has been occurring within and across most 
geographies. Financial stock that is off balance 
sheet has been growing at about 7 percent  
annually, whereas financial stock on the balance 
sheet has grown at about 4 percent annually.26 
Between 2015 and 2022, more than 70 percent of 
the net increase in financial funds went into off­
banking balance sheet (Exhibit 12).

26 Retail assets under management include funds and ETFs sold to individual investors through banks, brokers, and wire houses.

28

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionThis migration has been taking place for two 
decades.27 It accelerated after the global financial 
crisis in 2008 as banks faced higher capital and 
regulatory responsibilities and, in some places, were 
looked to for lending that would bolster economic 
growth. The flow off the balance sheet has now 
turned into an exodus that challenges the often 
heavily cross­subsidized nature of the financial 
services industry (for example, when a loan serves 
as a loss leader for subsequent advisory transaction 
business). Once corporate and retail depositors 
shift, this behavior can prove sticky, with banks 
having difficulty regaining those deposits. This, in 
turn, can create a structural deposit shortfall. 

Though assets have been shifting off the balance 
sheet globally, there are some regional disparities 
(Exhibit 13). In the United States, more than 75 percent 
of the net increase in financial funds now go off the 
banking balance sheet. In Europe, the figure is about 
55 percent. In contrast, the proportion of off­
balance sheet in China is less than 30 percent and 
in Latin America is less than 40 percent. Further, 
there is a marked growth differential between assets 
off and on balance sheet. For example, in North 
America, off balance sheet has been growing at  
9 percent. Compared with 7 percent growth for on 
balance sheet. In the Middle East, the difference is 
larger: 6 percent for off balance sheet and 3 percent

27  Traditional lending to middle­market and large corporates is increasingly being provided by private capital players, some of which have more 
than $100 billion in assets, making them equivalent to a formidably sized “bank.” As of the second quarter of 2023, these funds had raised 
more than $90 billion and had more than $400 billion of dry powder to lend. (Loan sizes are also increasing.) Private capital already makes up 
a significant portion of leveraged finance. Globally, these nonbank financial firms account for 14 percent of all lending.

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transitionfor on balance sheet. In China, it is 12 percent versus 
8 percent. In China and North America, the growth 
in money market funds (9 percent and 16 percent, 
respectively) is nearly double that of the growth in 
deposits (5 percent and 8 percent, respectively). 

private capital, followed by Asia. Retail assets under 
management, which account for 21 percent of  
total funds, also have grown robustly, at an annual 
rate of 9 percent since 2015. 

The sources of funds for the growth in off­balance­
sheet capital and associated dynamics are 
noteworthy (Exhibit 14). Private capital—both private 
debt and private equity—remains a relatively small 
part of the market, about 3 percent of the total, but 
it has been growing rapidly, at an average annual 
rate of almost 20 percent between 2015 and 2022. 
North America remains the largest market for 

Annual growth of both private debt and private 
equity has been accelerating (Exhibit 15). Private debt 
saw its highest inflows in 2022, with growth of  
29 percent. Still, private debt remains relatively 
small, compared with total volume of wholesale 
loans. In North America alone, private debt assets 
under management amount to about 8 percent  
of wholesale loans.

Within private debt, direct lending has driven much of 
this shift. After the global financial crisis, there was 
a large­scale withdrawal of banks from the leveraged 
lending market. In addition, private financing channels 
often have advantages including speed, flexibility, 
and convenience. Direct lending grew at an average 
annual clip of 13 percent between 2015 and 2022, 
and surveys have suggested that limited partners 
plan to invest more capital in direct lending in  
the next 12 months.28

Shift in transactions from traditional to 
nontraditional institutions
Transaction volumes have been and are moving to 
nontraditional, more specialized players. These 
include capital market infrastructure providers, 
which have seen robust 7 to 8 percent annual 
growth in the past few years, even throughout the 

COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying supply 
chain disruptions, as well as open platform models 
that deliver distribution and sales support or client 
communication services. Banks have for several 
years been selling and spinning off operations, or 
acquiring them to gain scale, including payment­
processing companies (for example, RBS’s spin­off 
of Worldpay), wealth and asset managers, and 
capital market units (for example, the initial public 
offering of MSCI). Often, the specialist players, 
whatever their origin, were able to grow faster.

In payments, this shift is evidenced by the increase 
in consumer digital payment processing conducted 
by payment specialists. Their share of payment 
processing grew by more than 50 percent between 
2015 and 2022, relative to traditional banks. 

28 Private Debt Investor’s LP Perspectives 2023 study.

31

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionIn capital markets, investment banks and broker–
dealers are gaining market share from traditional 
banks in various products. This includes equity 
capital, where specialized players raised their market 
share from 44 percent to 59 percent, in 2015–22, 
and foreign­exchange transactions, where the 
specialized players saw their market share increase 
from less than 1 percent in 2015 to 22 percent  
in 2022.

In wealth and asset management, independent 
asset managers not owned by a bank or insurer are 
gaining market share. Asset managers not owned 

by a bank had a market share in 2022 of 81 percent 
of assets under management, up from 77 percent in 
2017 (Exhibit 16).

Distribution also is evolving, although the change 
is still at an early stage 
Though this trend is on a more distant horizon than 
the others, distribution is shifting toward hybrid 
models, including third­party transactions, which in 
some cases are not constrained by a balance sheet. 
For example, in many markets, online comparison 
platforms now have significant market shares across 
consumer finance, mortgages, and even deposits

Although it is the last banking pillar to be affected, 
the shift in distribution has begun in Europe and 
Asia, where some services have launched and are 
scaling in multiple countries simultaneously. 

The transformation of banking distribution owes 
much to technological innovation. Technology 
adoption has focused mostly on retail via comparison 
platforms for mortgages, consumer finance, and 
deposits. These have reached more than 40 percent 
market penetration in many markets—for example, 
consumer finance in Sweden and mortgages  
in Germany.

Moreover, embedded finance (defined as the 
seamless integration of financial products and 
services into nonbanking products and business 
models) has continued to take off, especially in 
some emerging markets. “Traditional” embedded­
finance ecosystems such as retail and B2C 
marketplaces and platforms have further consoli­
dated their value propositions, while emerging 
ecosystems such as mobility, travel/hospitality, and 
digital content are rapidly gaining ground. Further 
growth in ecosystems will be driven by the 
emergence of B2B marketplaces and platforms. 
While embedded finance’s long­term prospects 
look increasingly appealing (revenue in the 
European Economic Area and the United Kingdom 
could reach €100 billion by 2030), the industry  
is still scaling and has focused on a select number  
of tested­and­tried products with potential for  
rapid scale­up: payments, insurance, and point­of­
sale lending. 

Banks’ reactions have differed: they long have had 
multiple distribution channels, including call centers 
for voice, branches for in­person interactions,  
a sales force for mortgages, relationship managers 
for the biggest clients, a mobile banking app, and so 
on. Removing these silos to have a streamlined, 
seamless approach can lead to huge performance 
improve ments, including a tripling of cross­selling 
and reduced operating costs in an industry where 
distri bution can amount to as much as 25 percent  

of operating costs.29 Yet banks have struggled to 
consistently connect embedded platforms and 
capture economic profits when using comparison 
platforms. As a result, we see a continued transition. 
The deposit­taking side, for example, is generally 
more regulated, and thus more protected, but this 
applies less to many credit aspects.

Variations in impact
A high­level view of banking’s three pillars—balance 
sheet, transactions, and distribution—highlights 
how the Great Banking Transition has been creating 
major divergences in terms of value generation  
and different valuations assigned by capital 
markets. Thus, the impact of the Great Transition  
will not be the same for all types of financial 
institutions. Broadly speaking, it will differ according 
to business models and depending on the 
macroeconomic outlook.

Divergent impact by business model
While profits still flow to traditional balance­sheet 
banks, economic value and positive shareholder 
returns increasingly have been flowing to institutions 
that are capital­light (Exhibit 17).30 Balance sheet 
activities accounted for 70 percent of the capital but 
just over half of revenues and profits in 2017–22. 
The ROE on balance sheet activities was between  
5 and 7 percent, far lower than for transactions  
and distribution, and economic profit was a negative 
$600 billion, primarily because of low ROE and  
a high capital base.

Transactions in the five years from 2017 to 2022 
accounted for just 12 percent of capital, but  
27 percent of revenues and 30 percent of economic 
profits, defined as return on shareholder capital 
minus the cost of that capital. With ROE since 2017 
ranging between 18 and 23 percent, transactions 
have posted the highest growth in economic profit, 
which is up by $115 billion since 2017.

Distribution accounted for just 18 percent of the 
capital but 20 percent of revenues and 27 percent 
of profits in 2017–22. Since 2017, the ROE for

distribution has been between 12 and 15 percent, 
and economic profit has grown by $85 billion.

Payments providers have created the most value  
in the five years between 2017 and 2022 while 
accounting for just 2 percent of the capital invested. 
Capital markets infrastructure providers are not  
far behind, with about 3 percent of the value created 
in 2017–22, though they invested just 1 percent  
of the total capital. 

By contrast, traditional universal banks—including 
global systemically important banks (GSIBs), market 
leader universal banks, and mid­tier universal 
banks—are the most capital­intensive institutions. 
They account for 85 percent of the capital invested 
in the financial system. They are now benefiting 

from the general uptick in the sector from higher 
margins, but once the capital charge is taken  
into account, they collectively have been losing 
value at a rate of 1 to 2 percent over the 2018–22 
period. Investment banks and broker dealers,  
along with wealth and asset managers, also have 
been losing value (Exhibit 18). 

Financial markets have been rewarding these shifts 
with higher valuations for value­generating specialist 
institutions. Thus, payment providers have a price­ 
to­book ratio that is about seven times the average 
valuation of traditional banks. Among other 
subsectors, only capital market infrastructure 
providers have earned valuations that are 
substantially higher than traditional banks, about 
three times as high.

Divergent impact by macroeconomic scenario
Past performance is no guarantee of future results—
that classic financial industry disclaimer can equally 
apply to the Great Banking Transition and the recent 
trends in the industry. The sudden rise in interest 
rates could be a game changer for both capital­heavy 
and capital­light players if it is sustained over  
the longer term. But if rates were to fall back again 
quickly to the low levels of the past decade,  
the bounce in profitability for many capital­heavy 
financial institutions may be short­lived. The 
macroeconomic scenario including the credit cycle 
that unfolds will thus have an impact on the Great 
Transition in the years ahead.

In a high­interest­rate environment, some of the 
successful business models of recent years could 
simply wash out, especially in jurisdictions where 
banks cannot adjust their equity easily—for example, 
because of regulation, political pressure, or 
business model. These include consumer finance 
players and payment providers, which have been 
able to move nimbly in a period of ultra­low rates to 
cherry­pick profitable business. Conversely, for 
traditional banks based on a balance sheet model, 
higher rates (and spreads) can potentially bring 
about a revival in their prospects. And the higher­
interest­rate environment may accelerate some 
business areas that would have languished or

building societies and long­term deposits.

Technology as transition enabler and 
emerging core business 
Underlying these shifts—both enabling and 
accelerating the Great Banking Transition—is 
technological innovation, which makes it possible  
to scale up delivery and reduce costs. The net  
effect is continuous pressure on all activities where 
scale and capabilities matter. Transactions have 
been at the forefront due to their more global nature 
and strong technology base. The pressure is now  
largely focused on balance­sheet­related activities, 
which are more local—including in their regulation—
and for which technology has been relatively lagging. 
Distribution often has the most local dimension,  
and in general is further behind.

spur for change, as is the ongoing cloud transition. 
With artificial intelligence reaching new levels  
of sophistication and maturity, especially with the 
advent of gen AI, tech­fueled competition is  
likely to become increasingly prevalent and a 
significant differentiator among banks that 
determines performance. 

Already, successful banks are deploying tech­backed 
business strategies with clear value at stake, such  
as engineering excellence and platform­oriented 
architecture, to identify technology investments 
that improve productivity. The transition toward these 
technology elements has enabled banks to lower 
their overall costs. This is particularly important, given 
the existing margin pressure and large share of 
technology costs being spent on maintaining old 
legacy systems. We see strong evidence of  
banks’ outperformance if they are leaders in 
technology investment (Exhibit 19).

Financial players are increasingly competing on the 
basis of technology to help enable scaled delivery 
and reduce costs. Digitization was an important

identify technology investments that improve 
productivity. This embrace of technology as a core 
part of business strategy and risk management, 
which enables banks to lower their technology and 
overall costs, can take several forms, including  
the following:

 — A focus on engineering excellence and joint 

business and IT operating models. In this case, 
about 75 percent of the full­time equivalents in 
technology delivery organizations are engineers, 
and as much as 95 percent of all IT applications 
are delivered and operated through automated 
continuous integration and continuous 
deployment pipelines.

 — Platform-oriented architecture. One institution 

took just nine months to develop a new 
proposition by building it, based on software­as­
a­service (SaaS) banking components. 

 — Automated infrastructure and public cloud. 
Institutions adopting this approach can host 
more than half of applications on the public cloud, 
with 85 percent of infrastructure provisions 
automated. Gen AI is the next forefront here.

So far, we’ve seen financial players moving across 
three horizons. One is the core business trans­
formation. This involves using the technology to 
reshape the core business and customer­facing 
operations—for example, collateral appraisal and 
direct customer interaction. Another horizon is  
the use of platform­based architecture or behind­
the­scenes integration of AI into operations, using 
applications such as virtual expert or frontline 
coaching to change the internal operating model. 
Finally, technology can be used for targeted 
productivity enhancement. In the gen AI example, 
this deploys SaaS solutions to improve the 
efficiency or accuracy of existing tasks, such  
as coding assistance, copy writing, and  
customer assistance.

The Great Banking Transition is changing the 
dynamics of financial institutions in multiple ways, 
across the balance sheet, payments, and 
distribution. These are structural shifts and, when 
combined with the uncertain macroeconomic 
outlook, pose considerable challenges for all 
financial institutions, whether traditional banks or 
the emerging galaxy of nonbanks. How should 
institutions respond to these changes? In the 
following chapter, we outline a few priorities. 

38

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transition3

Five priorities to 
capture the moment

Regardless of the macroeconomic developments, 
all banks will have to find ways to adjust and adapt to 
the changing environment that the Great Banking 
Transition will give rise to. The trends of technology, 
regulation, risk, and scale we highlighted in Chapter 
1 are secular ones that will need to be addressed 
regardless of the outlook for interest rates and 
economic growth. For balance­sheet­focused banks, 
the implications of this shifting environment touch 
all aspects of their business, including overall balance 
sheet management, such as capital allocation, 
funding profile, asset mix, and risk capacity. Non­
banks, too, will need to keep moving, as new 

technologies spur ever faster change and 
innovation. Mergers and acquisitions may gain  
in importance.

Besides overcoming challenges, banks have a major 
opportunity to create value if they can reinvent 
themselves. This concluding chapter lays out five 
possible and not mutually exclusive priorities that 
could help institutions survive and thrive: exploiting 
technology and AI, flexing the balance sheet, scaling 
or exiting transaction business, leveling up distri­
bution and the customer relationship, and adapting 
to a changed risk environment (Exhibit 20).

Priority 1: Exploiting technology  
and AI 
As we have seen, technology is a game changer  
for banks when it is used with skill and creativity and 
is fully integrated into an institution’s ecosystem  
and operating model. The pace of technological 
innovation is not slowing, and productivity­
enhancing innovation is increasingly possible. We 
have seen leaders in some geographies such as 
Europe invest 2.5 times more than laggards.

 — Future-proof the tech foundation to cultivate a 

cloud­based, platform­oriented architecture that 
allows for continuous innovation and the ability to 
implement next­generation capabilities.

 — Improve capabilities to address technology 
risks to enhance processes to identify 
continuously evolving next­generation threats, 
such as remote work security, while mitigating 
cyber and AI risks, which can include 
sophisticated ransomware.

To compete on technology, banks could consider 
several options:

 — Capture the AI opportunity to deploy (often 
together with advanced analytics) process 
automation, platforms, and ecosystems across 
customer services to provide better and more 
efficient services, front to back. 

 — Scale the delivery of product and services  
to products and platforms to operate like  
a tech company and prioritize engineering 
excellence (for example, delivery agility, 
DevSecOps) by aggressively pursuing top  
tech talent and partnerships.31

Priority 2: Flexing and even unbundling 
the balance sheet
Financial institutions seeking to follow the broader 
trend by reducing the balance sheet and moving 
business off balance sheet can create opportunities 
to distribute risk to a broader set of investors.  
The macroeconomic outlook and changes in 
interest rates over the medium to longer term will 
likely determine the dynamics of this aspect of  
the Great Banking Transition. For those making  
the call that capital­light institutions are the way to 
go, an option could be unbundling; for others, it  
will be flexing. 

31  DevSecOps stands for development, security, and operations. It signifies integration of security as a shared responsibility throughout the 
entire IT life cycle and allows organizations to deploy new code rapidly. See, for example, “What is DevSecOps?,” Red Hat, March 10, 2023.

40

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionFlexing implies active use of syndication, including 
for loans; originate­to­distribute (including for ESG 
project finance, for example); and third­party 
balance sheets—for example, as part of banking­
as­a­service (BaaS) business when using white­
labeled revolving credit cards. It may also include 
the active use of comparison platforms to gain 
deposits or distribute unused balance­sheet space. 
At the very least, it will for many institutions include 
a renewed focus on deposits, especially in North 
America and Europe, where a whole generation of 
bankers has never experienced a need to collect 
deposits and build or reinforce a sustainable 
funding structure.

Unbundling the balance sheet pushes this concept 
further. It can mean separating out customer­facing 
businesses from BaaS businesses and using 
technology to radically restructure costs.32 Analogous 
unbundling has already occurred in the telecom and 
semiconductor industries in previous decades. For 
example, when cell phones increased in popularity, 
telecoms struggled to develop necessary customer­
facing strategies within their traditional business 
models and split into wholesale network providers 
(capital­intensive, low­ROE business) and retail 
providers (high­ROE, customer­facing business). 

Whether to flex or to fully unbundle depends on  
the situation. Doing either is especially relevant to 
capital­heavy banks and can be undertaken to 
varying degrees and in a number of stages; it’s not 
an all­or­nothing proposition. Often, banks cannot 
adjust their equity easily or are under obligation to 
utilize their balance sheet as much as possible—for 
example, because of regulation, political pressure, 
or business model. The benefits of both approaches 
would include the following, to various degrees: 

 — Customer service and business capacity. Banks 
could originate credit business. For example, the 
net­zero transition may be an opportunity for 
more flexible balance­sheet usage by bringing in 
investors with different time and risk horizons.

 — Capital optimization. Optimizing capital enables 
banks to hold on to the assets for which the 
balance sheet is most efficient (with regard to 
attractiveness for other banks, nonbanks,  
and investors).

 — Portfolio and risk optimization. Banks have an 
option to choose what they hold, optimize  
their portfolio mix, and generate additional value 
by lowering their risk profile.

Flexing or unbundling may also shift the lending 
business model from being primarily spread income 
based to one that includes fee income from 
distributed assets. By separating out the balance 
sheet and treating it as a pure play, the company 
may be able to reduce the cost of equity and boost 
the level at which the core balance sheet trades 
closer to book value. For customer­facing banking 
business, unbundling essentially allows financial 
institutions to double down in prioritized growth 
products and services that are customer facing—for 
example, investment advisory and commerce 
marketplaces. Typically, these have average ROEs 
between 16 and 18 percent and cost of equity 
between about 10 and 12 percent.

For BaaS business, this process provides 
opportunities to be a utility provider or a balance 
sheet provider. Utility providers may deliver 
regulatory expertise and back­office services. 
Balance sheet providers offer access to capital and 
liability management. BaaS providers typically 
achieve ROE and cost of equity of 6 to 8 percent, 
with ROE higher than the cost of equity.

The Great Banking Transition also provides an 
opportunity for banks to reimagine risk 
management. They can revamp capabilities to 
manage credit and liquidity risks with increased 
efficiency and respond to evolving regulatory 
changes and emerging risks with increased agility. 
We discuss this further in relation to the fifth priority, 
adapting to a changed risk environment.

December 2022.

41

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionPriority 3: Scaling or exiting 
transaction businesses
Although the Great Banking Transition has been 
happening across payments, asset management, 
and capital markets and infrastructure for a long 
time, most customers still need these services (with 
banks being the distributors). Many banks still  
hold operations for these services, but many of the 
benefits have accrued to specialists. From best­
practice examples, we can see that scale in a 
particular market or product is the key to success. 
But scale can be multifaceted: institutions can  
find a niche in which to go deep, or they can look to 
cover an entire market. Following are some points  
to consider for scale:

 — Decide whether to scale or exit. Assess the 

institution’s existing and potential products or 
services on the basis of whether you have 
sufficient scale. More captive business models 
might provide benefits, such as in­house card 
issuing, asset management, and securities 
services; however, external specialists are often 
more efficient. As rule of thumb, more regulated 
and smaller markets need more local develop­
ments; in other words, if no fintechs, global asset 
services, or acquirers have interest to operate 
locally, you may need to do it yourself.

 — Aggressively pursue economies of scale, 
examples may be through mergers and 
acquisitions. Scale can be used to improve 
offerings, geographic reach, processes, and cost 
levels. M&A, along with technology, has been  
a key differentiator between traditional banks 
and specialists; consider an M&A strategy  
(and budget) in order to scale.

 — Leverage partners to help with exits. The flip side 

of scaling up in some areas is to reduce in 
others, to improve focus. Retail banks will likely 
need card­issuing and asset management 
services for their customers, for example. 
Partners can help take care of respective sub­
businesses, including payments to security 
services and asset management.

Across all this, it is important to note that modern 
tech foundations, especially cloud and APIs, make 
switching and managing partners easier.

Priority 4: Leveling up distribution
Connecting or reconnecting with customers is  
an essential element of thriving during the  
Great Banking Transition. Several paths can help 
achieve this:

 — Innovate how to interact with clients through 
hybrid and digital models. In particular, solve 
advisory, which many institutions have mastered 
offline but not usually in hybrid or online form. 
Conversely, while many private and wealth 
managers as well as corporate offerings have 
successfully established advisory services, their 
digital offerings are often lagging behind.

 — Decide on your strategy toward third-party 

distribution. The strategy could involve partner­
ships to create embedded finance opportunities 
(for example, buy­now­pay­later applications), 
platform­based models including build and 
operate software platforms that directly address 
customer needs (for example, supply­chain­
finance platforms or passive investment 
opportunities), or establishing the company in 
marketplaces and ecosystems to create 
opportunities to serve customer needs with 
products outside your immediate  
business models. 

 — Stop the leakage where possible. Ending 

leakage is especially important with regard to 
price discovery and comparison platforms by 
selective engagements, separate products, and 
technology use.

 — Involve private, corporate, and merchant 

banking. Banking leaders often see distribution 
as a retail issue, but it goes potentially  
much deeper.

42

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking TransitionPriority 5: Adapting to a changed  
risk environment
Chief risk officers in financial organizations  
are dealing with a plethora of complex issues in  
the current environment. These include the 
macroeconomic context, featuring inflation and 
geopolitical uncertainty; an uncertain growth 
outlook, and potential credit challenges in specific 
sectors such as commercial real estate; the 
regulatory environment, including changing 
requirements under the Basel III endgame, along 
with cyber and fraud regulation, and the importance 
of data; and the exponential integration of  
advanced analytics into the banking ecosystem— 
for example, with gen AI—which will have knock­  
on effects across multiple risk dimensions including 
credit, cyber, data quality, fraud, market, and  
model risk among others.

Issues related to the Great Banking Transition  
are more strategic: the movement raises a set of 
long­term questions that need to be addressed 
thoughtfully. Among them: given the migration of 
funds, transactions, and distribution to nonbank 
entities, how should the role of the risk function be 
redefined to be part of the value creation story?

With many activities transitioning outside the 
perimeter of bank­specific regulation, the risk 
function will become a significant differentiating 
factor for banks relative to nonbanks. Trust, 

confidence, and security will play an increasingly 
important role in clients’ and customers’ minds,  
both retail and corporate, as well as for business 
partners and regulators.

Regardless of the specifics of the future landscape, 
these trends will further elevate the strategic value 
of the risk function. 

In recognizing this evolving landscape, risk 
functions can take several no­regret actions, such 
as these:

 — Elevate the risk narrative to make it a true 

differentiator. For example, in client discussions, 
product design, and communications, highlight 
the bank’s resilience based on its demonstrated 
track record of managing systemic risk  
and liquidity, data protection, cyber, and 
operational resilience.

 — Further strengthen the first line, and embed  
risk into day­to­day activities, as opposed to 
conducting after­the­fact oversight.

 — Invest in newer risk activity areas, many driven 
by the growth of gen AI and other advanced 
analytical techniques, including cyber, fraud, 
and model risk. This would underscore  
that risk has moved far beyond credit and 
market factors.

43

The Global Banking Annual Review 2023: The Great Banking Transition — Embrace the importance of data as an asset, 
and treat data risk as an enterprise topic  
that requires the right governance, operating 
model, and controls across both providers  
and consumers of data assets.

 — Focus on outcomes and not process. In other 
words, determine what the bank is actually 
getting out of its risk and control self­assessment, 
as opposed to focusing on getting the process 
right. Rethink committees and governance in 
light of the trends mentioned earlier.

 — Pay close attention to talent implications, linking 
risk expertise with frontline understanding—for 
example, spanning integrative skill sets that can 
look across risk stripes and deep expertise in 
cyber and fraud groups that speak the language 
of banking.

 — Proactively prepare for increased regulatory 

scrutiny through increased foresight, scenario 
planning, and stress testing; improve trans­
parency and depth of reporting at both board 
and management levels; increase focus on 
operational resilience; and prepare for faster 
response times, to both external factors  
and regulatory inquiry, and increased  
decision velocity. 

The Great Banking Transition has been a dominant 
underlying theme for the banking sector, and the 
industry may have reached an inflection point, now 
that more than half of the global balance sheet  
has transitioned and technology is likely to induce 
more change. The recent rise in interest rates will 
change some dynamics, but regardless of the 
outlook for interest rates and the economy more 
broadly, financial institutions should consider  
how they will set themselves up for success in this 
fundamentally new environment.

While the degree of change can be disconcerting, 
banking has a historic opportunity to reinvent itself. 
If banks—whether they are traditional universal 
banks, specialists, or new players—can find a 
business model that reduces the sector’s valuation 
discount to other sectors, the upside in terms of 
value creation could be enormous. Banks can seize 
the opportunity if they parse their balance sheet, 
transaction, and distribution businesses to identify 
which of them create value or provide a competitive 
advantage. Where do their competitive advantages 
lie within each? How will technology and AI impact 
the market and their advantages? They can identify 
what it will take to create economic value with new 
business models in the future macroeconomic 
environment, amid heightened geopolitical risks, to 
compete with an ever­broader set of competitors. 
The effort will be difficult, but for institutions with 
powerful new technologies and a revised mindset, a 
new era of value creation is possible.
