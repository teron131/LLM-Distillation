 — Arenas are a unique category of industries defined by two characteristics: high growth and 
dynamism. They capture an outsize share of the economy’s growth, and the market shares of 
players within them change to an outsize degree.

 — We have identified 18 potential arenas of the future that could reshape the global economy, 

generating $29 trillion to $48 trillion in revenues by 2040. These arenas range from AI 
software and services to cybersecurity, from future air mobility to drugs for obesity and related 
conditions, and from robotics to nonmedical biotechnology These future arenas could generate 
$2 trillion to $6 trillion in profit by 2040. Their collective share of global GDP could increase from 
4 percent to 10 to 16 percent by 2040.

 — Twelve arenas of today showed outsize growth and dynamism from 2005 to 2020. These 
industries include e-commerce, biopharma, electric vehicles, consumer internet, and cloud 
services. They had a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 percent and market 
capitalization CAGR of 16 percent, and they tripled their global GDP share from 3 to 9 percent in 
the period. By contrast, non-arenas had only a 4 percent revenue CAGR and a 6 percent market 
cap CAGR over the same period.

 — The many striking differences between the 12 arenas of today and non-arenas inform our 

understanding of the arenas of the future. Arenas earn far greater profits than other industries 
do, they spawn a disproportionate number of global giants, and they offer unusually strong 
opportunities for new entrants to become powerhouses.

 — Three combined ingredients in an “arena-creation potion” tend to generate the escalatory 
mode of competition that characterizes arenas. The telltale elements of a forming arena 
are business model or technological step changes, escalatory investments, and a large and/or 
growing addressable market. The presence of these elements can lead to escalatory competition 
among players, who make large investments to gain not only market share but also a product 
quality edge, compounding the benefits and further setting them apart from other companies in a 
race to the top.

Introduction

This report from the McKinsey Global Institute identifies and describes a category of industries that 
could account for much of the future change in the business landscape and transform the world. We 
call these industries arenas of competition. To identify the arenas of tomorrow, we look back at the 
arenas of today to see how they evolved. Arenas are defined by two characteristics: they capture an 
outsize share of the economy’s growth, and market share within them changes hands to an outsize 
degree. The presence of those two attributes indicates that a new competitive game has begun, 
usually prompted by a new bundle of technologies and business models.

Understanding arenas is important for at least two reasons. First, they are where the business 
world is reshaped. They account for many major shifts in investment, R&D, and value, as well as 
the emergence of many new and growing global corporations. Second, once we start to recognize 
the factors that could point to the potential formation of an arena, we can identify a set of arenas 
that could plausibly emerge over the next 15 years. If the past is any guide, they will be centers of 
competition, innovation, and value creation.

The report begins with a discussion of 12 arenas of competition that emerged between 2005 and 
2020, including cloud services, e-commerce, biopharmaceuticals, and electric vehicles (EVs). 
Chapter 1 identifies the arenas of today by drawing on a large, customized data set of the top 
3,000 companies by market cap and explores how the arenas differ from other industries. We used 
2005 to 2020 as our analytical interval to delineate a clean decade boundary and ensure consistent, 
well-established data. Some of the differences are striking: in 2005, these arenas generated only 
9 percent of our sample’s economic profit, but by 2019 they accounted for 49 percent of all economic 
profit in the biggest companies. 

In chapter 2, we examine how today’s arenas emerged and grew as companies entered a mode of 
intense competition and made the escalatory investments characteristic of arenas. Understanding 
this industrial logic is crucial because knowing how today’s arenas were born could help us  
spot tomorrow’s potential arenas. We identified a “potion” that appears to underlie the emergence 
of arenas. 

In chapter 3, we describe 18 potential arenas of tomorrow and explore how they may materialize, 
including their potential sources of growth and dynamism. Understanding potential arenas is 
relevant for entrepreneurs and incumbent companies that want to compete directly in arenas, other 
companies whose businesses would be affected by the emergence of arenas, investors looking 
to allocate capital to these industries, people seeking jobs in the winning industries of the coming 
decades, and policy makers looking to play a role in how and where these industries develop.

A compendium covering the 18 industries that could become the arenas of tomorrow includes further 
descriptions of the growth factors and competitive dynamics that we present in the report and that 
could shape each potential arena over the coming decades. To be sure, looking into the future is 
always speculative, and we recognize the possibility—indeed, the likelihood—that we may be getting 
some things wrong. For that reason, we have made transparent our assumptions, or what you need to 
believe about each candidate arena to match our scenarios. This will allow readers to calibrate their 
own views of which industries will end up becoming arenas.

Executive summary

This report identifies a set of present and future arenas of competition, industries that could 
transform the business landscape and our world. Arenas are defined by high growth and high 
dynamism. These industries capture an outsize share of value growth, and market share within them 
shifts dramatically, as measured by the “shuffle rate,” a metric of company market share movements 
(Exhibit E1). These two characteristics signal a new era of competition and signify new technologies 
and business models in play.

The arenas of today
We have identified 12 arenas of today: software, semiconductors, consumer internet, e-commerce, 
consumer electronics, biopharmaceuticals, industrial electronics, payments, video and audio 
entertainment, cloud services, electric vehicles (EVs), and information-enabled business services 
(ranked in order of 2020 market cap). “Arenas of today” refers to the arenas that formed over the past 
two decades. We used 2005 to 2020 as our analytical interval to set a clean decade boundary and 
ensure consistent, well-established data. Understanding arenas is important for at least two reasons. 
Not only are they where the business world is reshaped, but recognizing the elements that are usually 
present in an arena and that help explain its growth and dynamism allows us to identify a set of arenas 
that could plausibly emerge over the next 15 years. If the past is any guide, they will be centers of 
competition, innovation, and value creation.

In 2005, arenas generated less than  
10 percent of total global economic  
profit. By 2019, they accounted 
for half of the total.

Today’s arenas stand out from other industries in six ways. 

 — Arenas captured an increasing share of economic profit. In 2005, arenas generated $55 billion, 

or 9 percent of total global economic profit, while other industries generated $549 billion, 
about 90 percent of the total. By 2019, arenas were generating $250 billion—half of total global 
economic profit. Comparing 2005 economic profit rankings with those from 2019 and 2020, 
every arena except industrial electronics moved up.

 — Arenas attracted outsize levels of investment for innovation. Arenas’ share of R&D investment 

was already high in 2005 and remained high for 15 years. Sixty-two percent of US business R&D 
spend went to arenas and arena-adjacent industries in 2005; that figure increased to 65 percent 
by 2020. Semiconductors and electrical components accounted for the largest share, followed by 
biopharmaceuticals and software.

 — Arenas enabled new entrants to grow. In 2020, 33 percent of arenas’ total market capitalization 
was held by companies that had been “outsiders” in 2005—that did not exist, had market caps 
of less than $3.5 billion, or existed but were not yet meaningful competitors in those arenas. In 
comparison, businesses new to non-arena industries held just 15 percent of total market cap. 
New players tended to enter during early stages of arena formation when competitors identified 
innovations that met customer demands as targets for investment. This competition led to arenas’ 
characteristic dynamism.

 — Arenas spawned giants. Arenas were more likely than non-arenas to give rise to the world’s 

largest companies. In 2020, 74 percent of arenas’ total market cap was held by companies with 
market caps greater than $50 billion, compared with 47 percent for other industries. Fifty percent 
of arenas’ total market cap was held by companies with market caps greater than $200 billion, 
compared with  only 15 percent for other industries. 

Large companies were also more likely to be in arenas. Of the companies with market caps above 
$200 billion, more than half belonged to arenas, even though arenas represent only one-fifth 
of the overall sample by number of companies. In 2005, just one of the top ten companies was 
in a future arena—Microsoft, with a market cap of $278 billion. By 2020, eight of the ten were in 
arenas, with market caps ranging from $511 billion to $1.7 trillion.

 — Arenas tended to be more concentrated. Concentration was observed at certain times in 

arenas; for example, the top ten players in five arenas (cloud services, consumer electronics, 
consumer internet, EVs, and payments) accounted for at least 90 percent of 2020 arena 
market cap and revenues in our sample. At the same time, competitive pressure to innovate 
remained. Investments that improve products or take advantage of network effects can have 
increasing returns, requiring leaders to continually innovate to retain prominence. Arenas’ 
industry structures are rarely static or stable in the long term. Escalatory investments and their 
exceptional returns for arenas can inspire fierce competition in markets that already have high 
levels of innovation, provoking step changes in technology and business, which can disrupt the 
ranks of winners.

 — Arenas were more global. On average, 50 percent of arena revenues were generated outside 
companies’ home regions, compared with 42 percent for non-arena companies. Companies in 
arenas were also much more likely to be multinationals. Sixty-eight percent of arena companies 
derived more than 20 percent of their revenues from countries other than their own. By 
contrast, about half of non-arena companies took in more than 20 percent of revenues from 
other countries. The software arena is particularly global. Its four largest companies by 2020 
revenues—Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP—generated almost 60 percent of their revenues 
outside their home countries.

The origins of arenas 
To help us identify future potential arenas, we examined how today’s arenas originated. We observed 
three elements that, when combined, were likely to result in high growth and high dynamism and to 
generate an arena. The three ingredients, which we call an “arena-creation potion,” are business 
model or technology step changes, escalation incentives for investments, and a large or growing 
addressable market. 

 — Business model or technology step changes. Technology performance and adoption are 

often modeled as idealized S-curves. When a technology capability undergoes a step change, 
adoption starts off slowly, reaches an inflection point when it accelerates, then flattens out as 
the technology reaches maturity. Although real-world technology capabilities and adoption 
do not perfectly adhere to this S-curve, we observe technology step changes in our arenas, 
for example the innovations in lithium-ion battery technology that enabled production of EVs 
at scale. Business model step changes can also result from technology that shifts commercial 
models (who pays for what and how) for products or services, thereby disrupting existing market 
structures, as occurred with e-commerce and with video and audio entertainment (streaming). 

 — Escalatory incentives for investments. Companies that leverage investments to not only produce 
more products but fundamentally change and improve their products can boost their competitive 
position and rapidly gain market share. Such investments are features of specific types of 
spending, such as marketing, R&D, and certain capital expenditures. As companies advance their 
capabilities in this way, they tend to also improve long-term margins and see returns increase with 
scale. As a result, competitors also have a strong incentive to invest, beginning an “arms race” 
in which they iteratively invest to scale and scale to invest, causing a simultaneous escalation in 
capabilities. This pattern accelerates growth and the kind of market share jumps that are typical 
of arenas, and eventually can limit the ability for new entrants to enter the arena, unless a new 
technology or business model step change again opens up the playing field.

 — Large or growing addressable market. Companies tend to reach large or fast-growing markets 
either by already playing in sizable markets where demand growth continues to outstrip the 
rest of the economy or by displacing share of an existing large market with a superior product 
or service. The companies in our arenas that played in fast-growing markets took advantage 
of technology and business model step changes to accelerate value creation. These markets 
typically already had revenue pools of more than $100 billion in 2005, and companies competing 
in them made escalatory investments that improved efficiencies or broadened capabilities. 
These arenas included biopharmaceuticals, industrial electronics, information-enabled business 
services, consumer electronics, payments, semiconductors, software, and video and audio 
entertainment. Together, they recorded 5 to 13 percent revenue compound annual growth rates 
(CAGRs) from 2005 to 2020. Companies that displaced share of existing large markets achieved 
rapid growth by launching novel categories of products or services, taking shares from existing 
markets or unlocking latent demand. These companies’ industries include cloud services, 
consumer internet, e-commerce, and EVs. Their revenue grew at a 13 to 33 percent CAGR from 
2005 to 2020.

The three ingredients of the arena-creation potion produce an escalatory mode of competition, 
which results in high growth and high dynamism. The continuous investments characteristic of 
escalatory competition typically build heightened competitive capabilities and globally relevant scale. 
Competition in these settings can be like a tournament with a huge prize to the winner, but it is not 
a lifelong crown, because a new round of competitive escalation often begins just as the last one is 
settling. This dynamic contrasts with more traditional modes of competition, which involve initial entry 
costs and additional investments to increase production quantity that result in more localized and

static industry structures. In escalatory competition, players must iteratively improve product quality 
through investment and capability building to obtain or retain market share.

In addition, the arenas of today generally benefited from the overall trend toward digitization. This 
last era of digitization was a fertile place for big arenas to bloom. Global internet connectivity allowed 
e-commerce players to connect buyers and sellers across the globe, providing the opportunity for 
customers to purchase goods anytime, anywhere. Digitization also transformed video and audio 
entertainment—and streaming video in particular—by shifting media consumption from movie 
theaters and CDs to homes and mobile devices.

Continual exponential improvements in the cost of processing and communicating information 
created a long S-curve. Digitization enabled global markets and scaled distribution platforms. 
Software-driven business models with low variable costs and strong network effects created a 
powerful battleground for escalatory investment. It is no surprise that most of today’s arenas are 
rooted firmly in the digital economy.

The arenas of tomorrow
With these insights on existing arenas and their characteristics as a guide, we have identified 18 
potential future arenas that together could yield $29 trillion to $48 trillion in revenues and $2 trillion 
to $6 trillion in profits by 2040 (Exhibit E2). In terms of impact on the economy, we estimate that 
they could grow from about 4 percent of GDP in 2022 to 10 to 16 percent by 2040. This translates 
to a 18 to 34 percent share of total GDP growth. This shift in GDP share is a hallmark of arenas: if we 
perform a similar analysis on our arenas of today, we find that the sample companies increased their 
equivalent share of GDP from 3 percent in 2005 to 9 percent in 2020.

Some arenas of today will  
continue as arenas of tomorrow.  
Others will no longer qualify 
for arena status.

The potential future arenas can be divided into three groups: arenas of today that are likely to 
continue developing into arenas of tomorrow; subsegments of current arenas that may grow 
sufficiently large and fast to become spin-off arenas; and emergent arenas that are not as closely 
linked as the potential spin-offs to any of today’s arenas. While at different stages of their evolution, 
each displays early signs of the three arena-creation potion elements. 

Continuing arenas
1.  E-commerce. Companies that sell goods through digital channels and fulfill them directly

2.  Electric vehicles. Manufacturers of battery, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell EVs

3.  Cloud services. Companies that deliver on-demand cloud infrastructure and platforms as 

a service

4.  Semiconductors. Designers and manufacturers of semiconductors, microchips, and integrated 

circuits as well as providers of tools for semiconductor manufacturing

Spin-off arenas
5.  AI software and services (spin-off from software). Companies that provide software and  

services incorporating AI, excluding the hardware necessary to operate AI

6.  Digital ads (spin-off from consumer internet). Platforms that enable advertisers to reach 

consumers digitally

7.  Streaming (spin-off from video and audio entertainment). Providers of on-demand video 

entertainment over the internet

Emergent arenas
8.  Shared autonomous vehicles. Operators of shared autonomous vehicle services 

9.  Space. Providers of space-related infrastructure and services to the commercial and state-

sponsored segments

10. Cybersecurity. Companies that provide protection for computer systems from unintended  

and unauthorized access, modification, or destruction

11.  Batteries. Manufacturers of rechargeable batteries used for EVs and other technologies  

that are mostly linked to the energy transition

12.  Video games. Producers and distributors of games played on dedicated consoles, PCs, and 

mobile phones

Five arenas of today—biopharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, information-enabled business 
services, industrial electronics, and payments—could lose arena status. They are unlikely to maintain 
the scale of growth and dynamism that would propel them into being arenas of tomorrow. 

We also examine almost-emergent arenas, industries with some elements that could make them 
arenas but that also have uncertain growth or dynamism prospects and a relatively lower probability 
of evolving into arenas. We include these because predicting the development of arenas is not an 
exact science, and we recognize that we could be wrong. These potential arenas could represent 
significant opportunities. The almost-emergent arenas include clean hydrogen, lower-carbon 
materials, products and services for older adults, nuclear fusion, renewables generation equipment 
and infrastructure, sustainable fuels, virtual reality and augmented reality, and Web3 (including 
decentralized finance).

Our analyses of present and future arenas reveal three key swing factors that go beyond 
uncertainties in the modeling and could be fundamental to the evolution of the arenas of tomorrow 
in technology, investment patterns, and sources of demand. These factors are developments in 
geopolitics affecting regulation of innovation and technological regionalization, advances and 
adoption of AI technology in a range of industries, and the pace of the green transition, which aims to 
alter the course of climate change and could drive demand in various parts of the market.

The 18 arenas of tomorrow we have identified could be even more materially transformative than the 
12 arenas of today, shaping how we consume and process data, approach health and wellness, and 
interact and communicate with one another. They could introduce new options for our lives as well as 
new questions about our social progress, from the morality and ethics underpinning data and privacy 
to imperatives for businesses to be inclusive and sustainable. Recognizing how and when arenas 
originate, understanding how they evolve, and anticipating the way they could change society can 
offer a unique view of the arc of society’s progress.

As we look forward, this report provides an initial view of where to expect the most growth and 
dynamism and how to update that view as the future takes shape. At the end of the report, we include 
a compendium that sketches the quantitative possibilities for the range of growth and the dynamism 
prospects of each of the 18 potential arenas of tomorrow.

The arenas of today

In 2005, there was no iPhone or App Store, no one had done a cloud migration, and a mass-market 
EV would have sounded like science fiction. Today, these technologies are commonplace, part 
of a wave of innovation that radically changed businesses, the economy, and the way we live. The 
economic growth from these innovations was concentrated in a relatively small number of industries.

The numbers tell the tale. Of the world’s top 20 companies by market cap at the end of 2005, only 
four remain in the top 20 as of September 2024. The combined market cap of the top 20 grew more 
than sixfold from around $4 trillion at the end of 2005 to $25 trillion by September 2024. Of the 
new entries, almost all were in a handful of industries we have designated as arenas. This picture 
looks remarkably similar for the interval of 2005 to 2020, the period we study in detail. Of the 
world’s 100 largest companies by market cap in 2005, only 46 remained on the list in 2020. Of the 
54 newcomer companies, almost half were in a handful of industries we have designated as arenas, 
lifting the total number of top 100 companies in arenas from ten in 2005 to 33 in 2020. Arenas are 
defined by two characteristics: their revenues and market cap increase at a far faster pace than the 
rest of the economy, and shares of revenue and market cap within them shift substantially over time. 
We identified 12 arenas that formed during the 2005–20 period, ranging from cloud services to 
e-commerce to consumer internet to biopharmaceuticals, that have reshaped the business world. 

Arenas also transformed our everyday lives, including the way we interact with one another, access 
information, complete tasks, entertain ourselves, and receive medical treatment. Take, for example, 
the simple experience of watching a movie with friends. In 2005, the process was straightforward: 
check schedules in the newspaper, call your friends, drive to the nearest theater or perhaps to the 
local video store in hopes that your DVD of choice is in stock. Today, a moviegoer would use their 
phone to check schedules online, decide if they want to buy a ticket in advance, message friends in 
a group chat, and proceed to the theater, perhaps in an EV hailed ride. Alternatively, you can decide 
to host a watch party, hop on a Zoom call, and stream a movie on Netflix. That activity alone involves 
a multitude of arenas, including semiconductors, software, and consumer electronics that enable 
mobile phone features; e-commerce, payments, and consumer internet, which allow the purchase of 
tickets online or buying streaming subscriptions; and EVs, industrial electronics, cloud services, and 
video and audio entertainment, which innovated ways of enjoying a service.

In this chapter, we describe the 12 arenas of today and explore how they differ from other industries.

Arenas are exceptional industries
For the purposes of this report, we have defined industries as groups of companies that compete for 
the same addressable market.1 Because these companies sell similar products and target the same 
customers, their strategies inevitably overlap, making them both competitive and interdependent. 
Companies can be part of more than one industry when they sell products and services in more than 
one market.

Arenas are a unique set of industries in which the competitive tussle is heightened, resulting in the 
two characteristics we have identified: extraordinary growth and exceptional dynamism or shifts in 
shares. Players in arenas tend to innovate in technology and business models, invest at escalating 
levels in competitive capabilities, and expand possible addressable markets. Arenas show far greater 
levels of growth and dynamism than their non-arena peers because of these characteristics.

Industries can be analyzed on many levels. To identify potential arenas, we selected definitions 
based on supply and demand considerations. The supply perspective required some similarity in 
the technology of competing companies, as arenas are often launched through technology step 
changes. The demand perspective ensured that the products and services were sufficiently similar 
or substitutable and could define an addressable market. Together, these two criteria allowed us 
to define potential arenas at comprehensible levels of granularity (but we also recognize that these 
criteria are subjective, and alternative delineations are possible). In some cases, arenas were defined 
as a fast-growing portion of an existing industry. To name one such case, the automotive industry 
can be partitioned between internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and EVs. A similar pattern 
applies to other instances where a new arena forms adjacent to and draws demand from a large 
existing industry, as is the case with e-commerce and traditional retail, and biopharmaceuticals and 
traditional pharmaceuticals.2

The arenas of today were at different stages of development on different timelines and followed 
different trajectories in the 2005–20 time frame. It’s easy to imagine the differing trajectories of the 
arenas of previous eras: oil and gas and mining, driven by rapid expansion of energy and materials 
needs; automobiles and commercial air travel, fueled by demand from a rising global middle class; 
and personal computers, powered by fast-growing new technologies, to name a few. 

We suggest, however, that today’s business landscape is influenced by the overlapping emergence 
of many big arenas. The common cause is the exponential force of digitization that has enabled both 
novel business models and rapid technological improvement on a global scale; we discuss these 
factors of critical importance later in this report. 

Now we turn to the arenas of today to determine how they differ from other industries.

Today’s 12 arenas grew quickly and were dynamic
To identify today’s arenas, we relied on a McKinsey data set covering the world’s 3,000 largest 
companies. For the purposes of our analysis, we reclassified some of them or parts of them 
from broad industry groups (such as retail) into more specific competitive categories (such as 
e-commerce). In some cases, this meant dividing a very large company (for example, Microsoft or 
Amazon) into two or three pieces, each in a different competitive category.

We then identified industries that exhibited outsize growth and market dynamism. Specifically, these 
industries grew quickly from 2005 to 2020, dramatically outpacing overall economic growth. That left 
them with a larger share of the world’s revenues and market cap in 2020 than in 2005, a difference 
we call the “industry share growth rate.” This metric captures the disproportionate value created in 
those industries. In addition, their dynamism, measured by company market share movements—a 
metric we call the “shuffle rate”—was relatively high during the period. In other words, there was more 
shifting of market share within the industries we selected to be arenas than in other industries (see 
sidebar “Industry dynamism measured by share shifts” and the technical appendix).

Sidebar: Industry dynamism 
measured by share shifts

To measure industry dynamism, we 
considered its degree of market share 
shifting by seeing how much either  
revenues or market cap changed hands 
among companies.

Consider some of the ten biggest players 
in the mobile and consumer electronics 
industry. In 2005, Sony held 27 percent 
of market share by revenue in this group, 
but by 2020, its share had declined to 
13 percent, a 14-percentage-point drop. 
Apple, by contrast, had a 4 percent market 
share by revenues in 2005. That had 
grown to 30 percent by 2020, an increase 
of 26 percentage points. Continuing this 

exercise for the entire market, we end up with 
market share percentage-point changes 
for each player. Adding up just the positive 
percentage-point changes gives us the 
industry’s market shuffle rate as measured by 
revenues: 53 percentage points (Exhibit A). 
We applied the same process for both 
revenues and market cap to all companies, 
not just the top ten, in each industry in our 
analyzed data set.

Exhibit A

The top ten companies in the consumer electronics industry had a 53-point 
shuffle rate.

Sidebar: Industry dynamism 
measured by share shifts  
(continued)

Now consider the top ten players in a 
different industry, aerospace and defense, 

which had notably less dynamism. Following 
the same approach, that industry had a 
16 percentage-point shuffle rate, much 
lower than the shuffle rate of the mobile and 
consumer electronics industry (Exhibit B).

 The shuffle rate indicates the degree of 
dynamism in an industry. We assumed that 

industries that had no revenues or market 
cap at the start of a period would necessarily 
have an aggregate share shift of 100 percent, 
as is the case with the nascent EV industry. 
Because high levels of dynamism were a 
criterion for qualifying as an arena, any 
nascent industry made the cut.

Exhibit B

The top ten companies in the aerospace and defense industry had a 16-point 
shuffle rate.

Our method for measuring industry-share growth rates and shuffle rates yielded rankings of 
industries by the extent of their growth and dynamism between 2005 and 2020—one set as 
measured by market cap (Exhibit 1) and another set as measured by revenues (Exhibit 2). We used a 
ranking system that considered both measures to settle on a single list of 12 arenas that placed high 
in combined ranking scores and had a 2020 market cap of at least $800 billion (for more information, 
see the technical appendix).

Our arenas displayed outsize growth compared with other industries from 2005 to 2020. Arena 
revenues grew 10 percent year-on-year in that period, while revenues in other industries grew just 
4 percent. The 12 arenas collectively more than doubled their share of revenue (from 6 percent in 
2005 to 14 percent in 2020) and nearly tripled their share of our data set’s total market cap (from 12 
percent in 2005 to 34 percent in 2020). The biggest industry share shifts were in categories created 
by the new tech giants: cloud services, consumer internet, and e-commerce, driven by the growth 
of leading technology companies like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft. 
For instance, e-commerce, which had the largest growth rate for both revenues and market cap, 
accounted for only $15 billion of revenues in 2005, or 0.1 percent of revenues across all industries. 
By 2020, this number had grown to $890 billion, or 2.4 percent of revenues across all industries. In 
market cap, our e-commerce sample was an $87 billion industry in 2005, or 0.35 percent of market

cap across all industries. That number grew to $3.3 trillion, or 4.2 percent of all industries, by 2020. 
Alibaba, Amazon, and JD.com contributed $547 billion, or 63 percent, of this revenue increase and 
$2.1 trillion, or 64 percent, of the market cap increase.3 Similarly, consumer internet represented 
$215 billion in 2005, or 0.87 percent, of total market cap, which grew to $3.5 trillion in 2020, or 
4.4 percent of market cap, in our data set. Alphabet, Meta, and Tencent were the largest players. 
Cloud services companies represented $54 billion in 2005, or 0.2 percent, of total market cap, which 
grew to $1 trillion and 1.3 percent of market cap by 2020, driven by growth of the cloud-services 
businesses of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft.

These arenas similarly demonstrated exceptional competitive dynamism, measured by the shifts of 
revenue and market cap shares within an industry, or the shuffle rate. Average revenue shuffle rates 
for arenas were 49 percent, compared with 32 percent for other industries. Average market cap 
shuffle rates were 66 percent for arenas, compared with 47 percent for other industries. 

Here we can see new industries transformed, as was the case with mobile and consumer electronics, 
in which the arrival of smartphones contributed to a large shift in the competitive landscape for 
players. Total industry revenues of $238 billion in 2005 were carved up as follows: Sony had the 
highest revenues, $64 billion (27 percent of the total), followed by LG with $41 billion (17 percent) and 
Samsung with $32 billion (14 percent). By 2020, total revenues had grown to $648 billion but had 
reshuffled, with smartphone players leading the way: Apple had revenues of $192 billion (30 percent 
of the total), and only Samsung continued to hold a top-three spot, with revenues of $88 billion 
(14 percent of the total). Sony and LG, which previously had the most revenues, now occupied the 
fourth and fifth spots, respectively.4 Nokia occupied the fifth spot in 2005 with 10 percent of revenue 
market share, but by 2020, it held only a 0.3 percent revenue market share in this segment. There is 
also dynamism happening in these industries beyond just their players in 2005 and 2020. The iconic 
Blackberry brand was still relatively small in 2005, with roughly $2 billion in revenues. This grew 
quickly to almost $20 billion by 2010, but then fell again to under $2 billion by 2015.

A similar analysis yields the same results for market cap, with high shuffle rates between players. 
Together, these shifts put consumer electronics high on the reshuffling axis. Cloud services, 
e-commerce, and EVs also experienced this internal reshuffling, to a large extent due to the large 
market share movements of the players mentioned above (Exhibit 3).

The share shifts in market capitalization are also more volatile compared with revenues. For example, 
the semiconductors arena had the lowest market cap shuffle rate among arenas at 41 percent 
through 2020. By June 2024, its shuffle rate had more than doubled to 87 percent, driven by Nvidia 
market cap growth, effectively giving semiconductors the third-highest market cap shuffle rate 
among arenas. This dynamism, even in a short time, is typical of an arena. As we explain in chapter 3, 
semiconductors may continue as a future arena, driven by technological step changes such as the 
advances of artificial intelligence that can enable rapid reordering of companies in the race to the top.

Following is a brief description of the 12 arenas of today, ranked by their market cap in 2020.

Software. Companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, and Adobe that develop, maintain, and distribute 
software, increasingly as a service.

Semiconductors. Companies such as Intel, TSMC, and Nvidia that design and manufacture 
semiconductors. This arena also includes the providers of tools used to manufacture semiconductors, 
such as ASML. 

Consumer internet. Companies such as Alphabet, Meta, and Tencent that provide consumers with 
internet services, including search, social media, and email.

E-commerce. Companies such as Amazon, JD.com, and Alibaba that only sell products online or 
provide online marketplaces. This arena also includes the divisions of traditional brick-and-mortar 
retailers that engage in online sales.

Mobile and other consumer electronics. Companies such as Apple and Samsung that engineer 
and manufacture personal mobile and other consumer electronics, such as smartphones, tablets, 
wearable devices, and televisions.

Biopharmaceuticals. Companies such as Amgen and Regeneron that develop and manufacture 
drugs based on biological materials like proteins and nucleic acids instead of producing traditional 
pharmaceuticals, which are typically drugs consisting of simpler chemical compounds. This arena 
also includes the biopharma segments of traditional pharma players, such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

Industrial electronics. Companies such as the contract manufacturers Foxconn, Jabil, and Flex that 
handle outsourced manufacturing for hardware designers (such as Foxconn for Apple). Also in this 
arena are original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Panasonic, Siemens, and ABB that 
manufacture electrical equipment, testing devices, and components. 

Payments. Companies such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express that provide payment and 
transaction services like the networks that process credit-card payments.

Video and audio entertainment. Companies such as Paramount, Disney, and Netflix that provide 
video and entertainment via broadcasting, video streaming, and audio streaming, as well as record 
labels such as Warner Music.

Cloud services. Companies and their divisions such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud 
Platform that provide IT infrastructure or platforms as online services, such as cloud computing and 
cloud storage.

Electric vehicles. Companies that manufacture EVs, ranging from those specializing only in EVs, such 
as BYD and Tesla, to the divisions of traditional automotive OEMs like Toyota, GM, and Mercedes-
Benz, which have added EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs to their product lines.

Information-enabled business services. Professional services firms such as Deloitte; information, 
data processing, and analytics providers such as ADP and S&P; and consumer-credit-reporting 
agencies such as Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.

Six key metrics that make today’s arenas stand out
We highlighted six metrics in which the arenas of today outpaced other industries: share of economic 
profit, share of R&D growth, proportion of new entrants, proportion of companies with a market 
cap of more than $200 billion, proportion of market cap held by top ten players, and proportion of 
companies that generate at least 20 percent of revenues from outside their home country (Exhibit 4).

Arenas capture an increasing share of economic profit. Today’s arenas captured a much larger share 
of economic profit in 2019 than they did in 2005. Economic profit is what is left over after subtracting 
the cost of capital from net operating profit. Put differently, it is revenue minus the explicit costs of 
doing business and the implicit opportunity costs. In 2005, the industries that went on to become 
arenas generated $55 billion, or 9 percent of total economic profit in our data set, while the other 
industries we studied generated a combined 91 percent of the total, or $549 billion. By 2019, the 
arenas were generating $250 billion, or 49 percent of total economic profit. And in the exceptional

pandemic year of 2020, the economic profit of arenas continued to increase, while collectively, the 
economic profit of other industries was negative. Underpinning this increase is a persistently higher 
return on invested capital of 28 percent in the arenas and 12 percent outside of them (Exhibit 5). 
Comparing 2005 economic profit rankings with those for 2019, every arena other than industrial 
electronics moved up (Exhibit 6).5

In 2019, consumer electronics led the arenas in economic profit with $58 billion, followed by 
consumer internet with $48 billion and semiconductors with $45 billion. In 2020, the same three 
arenas were in the lead. Many developments—including rising global smartphone penetration, 
companies’ widespread shift to cloud computing, and the increase in microchips embedded in a 
multitude of physical devices such as automobile components—boosted demand for the products in 
these arenas and fueled profits.

The decrease in economic profit among non-arena companies during the same period resulted from 
a number of factors, including a long-term decline of performance in commodity-driven energy and 
material sectors, lackluster performances by companies based in Europe, and lower profitability 
in the world’s “next largest” companies (those that rank beneath the 500 largest companies by 
revenue).6 The industries showing the biggest reduction in economic profit from 2005 to 2019 were 
oil and gas, which dropped $143 billion; retail and commercial banks, which fell $69 billion; non-bank 
financials, which dropped $58 billion; and mining, which fell $45 billion. The COVID-19 pandemic 
exacerbated these effects in 2020. Of course, these dynamics change with economic cycles, 
and some of the industries that trended downward from 2005 to 2020 may see a resurgence; for 
example, energy has experienced an upswing.

Arenas are where investment and innovation happen. Today’s arenas received a disproportionate 
amount of R&D investment from 2005 to 2020. In the United States, 62 percent of all R&D spending 
was already allocated to arenas and arena-adjacent industries in 2005.7 That share increased to 
65 percent in 2020. Despite arenas’ larger base, their R&D spending grew more than R&D spending 
in other industries over the same period (Exhibit 7). As a share of revenues, arenas also spent more

on R&D: in 2020, 10 percent of the revenues of arenas and arena-adjacent industries went to R&D, 
compared to 5 percent for other industries.8

In data from the US National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, semiconductors and 
electric components led in R&D spending, followed by biopharmaceuticals and software. The 
semiconductor industry spent $43 billion on R&D in 2020, up from $19 billion in 2005. This increase 
reflected intense competition resulting from the disaggregation of the semiconductor value chain. 
Under the new model, companies made a series of competitive moves across the value chain, 
escalating investments in increasingly expensive efforts to stake out the technical frontier of one 
product segment or a single step of the value chain. Nvidia, for example, increased its annual R&D 
spending by a factor of 11 between 2005 and 2020 to become the leading player in the market for 
graphics processing units (GPUs).9

Biopharma followed with an estimated $92 billion in R&D spending in 2020, up from $35 billion 
in 2005. This reflected the increase in pharmaceutical companies’ average R&D spending as 
a percentage of revenues from about 17 percent in 2005 to 25 percent by 2020.10 In addition, 
biopharmaceuticals R&D grew at a 14 percent average annual growth rate in the same period, 
compared with 4 percent for traditional pharmaceuticals. Software followed with an increase in R&D 
spending from $17 billion in 2005 to $35 billion in 2020.

Arenas attract “outsiders.” Arenas are fertile ground for new entrants. In 2020, 33 percent of arenas’ 
total market cap was held by companies that had been “outsiders” in 2005—that didn’t exist, had 
market caps of less than $3.5 billion, or existed but were not yet meaningfully competing in those 
arenas. In other industries, just 15 percent of the total market cap in our data set in 2020 was held by 
businesses new to those industries. The entry of new players often happens during the early stages 
of arena formation, when competitors make investments as they discover which innovative products 
and services meet customer demand. Naturally, this means higher dynamism observed in arenas as 
competition plays out.

The consumer internet arena is a good example. About half of that industry’s companies—including 
giants such as Meta, Meituan, and Shopify—either did not exist or did not report any public market 
cap in 2005.11 That said, it would be wrong to think that only young companies belong in arenas. 
Microsoft and Apple are nearly half a century old.

Arenas spawn giants. Arenas are more likely than other industries to include the world’s largest 
companies. In 2020, 74 percent of arenas’ total market cap was held by companies with market caps 
greater than $50 billion, compared with 47 percent for other industries. Fifty percent of arenas’ total 
market cap was held by companies with market caps greater than $200 billion, compared with only 
15 percent for other industries (Exhibit 8). The same pattern is visible from a perspective of number 
of firms. In 2020, 15 percent of arena companies had market caps greater than $50 billion, compared 
with 9 percent of non-arena companies. Four percent of arena companies had market caps greater 
than $200 billion, while only 1 percent of non-arena companies met that benchmark.

While arenas are more likely to see most of their market cap driven by giant companies, it is also true 
that giant companies are more likely to be in arenas. Of the companies that have market caps above 
$200 billion, more than half belong to arenas, even though arenas represent only one-fifth of the 
overall sample by number of companies (Exhibit 9). In 2005, only one of the top ten companies was in 
a future arena—Microsoft, with a market cap of $278 billion. By 2020, eight of the ten were in arenas, 
with market caps ranging from $511 billion to $1.7 trillion.12 The market cap lead was even more 
pronounced by 2024.

Information technology played an enormous role in the growth of arena giants. In 2005, the ten 
largest companies by market capitalization included several oil and gas firms as well as other well-
known brands, such as GE and Walmart. By 2020, the top ten were led by tech companies: Alibaba, 
Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tencent. By 2024, there was only one non-arena firm 
in the top ten.

Arenas tend to be more concentrated. Market cap and revenues are more concentrated in the 
largest arena companies than in non-arena companies. Consider the ten largest players in each of 
our arenas in 2020. The top ten in five arenas—cloud services, consumer electronics, consumer 
internet, EVs, and payments—accounted for at least 90 percent of market cap and revenues in our 
sample in 2020. Similarly, the top ten players in e-commerce and video and audio entertainment had 
about 80 percent of both market cap and revenues in 2020. That is, more than half of the arenas met 
this 80 percent threshold. By comparison, only a quarter of non-arena companies met this cutoff for 
market cap and less than two-fifths did so for revenues.

But the industry structure is often not static or stable in the longer term. Even when arenas are 
concentrated, the competitive pressure to innovate persists, as investments that improve products 
or take advantage of network effects can have increasing returns, requiring the leaders to continually 
push to remain on top (discussed further in chapter 2). In the consumer internet arena, for instance, 
the three largest companies—Alphabet, Meta, and Tencent—accounted for 72 percent of market 
cap and 78 percent of revenues in 2020. In 2012, those same top three accounted for 73 percent 
of market cap. During that time intense competition shifted among the three companies, with 
Alphabet’s share dropping from roughly 50 percent to 30 percent and both Meta and Tencent 
increasing from roughly 10 percent to 20 percent.

Furthermore, arenas are often markets with high levels of innovation, leading to step changes in 
technology and business models, which can disrupt the existing group of winners (see “Arenas are 
where investment and innovation happen” in this chapter). In some instances, the step changes also 
result in new spin-off arenas forming, which we explore in chapter 3. For example, the emergence 
of chatbots powered by generative AI (gen AI) threatens the advertising-supported web search 
business model, and platforms with short-form videos recommended by algorithms have grown 
quickly to capture user engagement in the social media space.

Arenas are more global. Arena companies tend to be more global than non-arena companies. 
On average, 50 percent of revenues in arenas were generated outside companies’ home regions, 
compared with 42 percent for non-arena companies. Moreover, companies in arenas were much 
more likely to be multinationals.13 Sixty-eight percent of companies from arenas derived more than 
20 percent of their revenues from countries other than their own, compared with about half of 
companies in other industries. 

Software is a particularly global arena. Fifty-three percent of its revenues came from outside its 
component companies’ home regions in 2020. The four largest companies by 2020 revenues—
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP, which together accounted for more than half of the software 
industry’s revenues—took in almost 60 percent of those revenues outside of their home countries. 
The global spread of these technology companies is unsurprising, given the digital nature of their 
products and services: they are not limited by shipping costs, physical plants, or input limitations, at 
least not directly (see sidebar “Companies based in the US and Greater China are disproportionately 
represented in arenas”).

Companies based in the United States were

for a substantial majority, 65 percent, of 
2020 market cap. US companies accounted 
for the majority of market cap in every arena 
except industrial electronics, where China 
took the lion’s share. China also participated 
materially in the consumer internet, EVs, 
e-commerce, and semiconductors arenas, 
with 22 to 30 percent of market cap. 

Companies based in Europe accounted 
for substantial market cap in biopharma, 
industrial electronics, and information-
enabled business services. However, 
European companies had a much higher 
share of global market cap in non-arena 
industries (22 percent) than they did in 
arenas (9 percent) (exhibit).

Four side-by-side examples
Some arenas are carved out of large established industries that don’t exhibit outsize growth and 
dynamism. This gives us a natural set of comparable examples of traditional industries and arenas 
to illustrate these differences. We describe four of them below: payments and banking, biopharma 
and pharmaceuticals, EVs and traditional ICE vehicles, and e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail 
(Exhibit 10). The four relatively new industries are examples of arenas that have sufficiently novel 
technologies or business models to merit separating them from the industries they disrupted during 
this period.

Our sample arenas surpassed their traditional counterparts in economic 
growth, market concentration, and opportunities for new entrants.

Consider how the payments industry, which is one of the arenas of today, compares with the closely 
related banking industry, which is not an arena. Banking showed economic profit of $88 billion in 
2005, but by 2019, economic profit had shrunk to $21 billion. During the same period, economic profit 
in the payments industry rose from $4 billion to $17 billion. Payments was also far more concentrated 
than banking: the top five companies in payments held 77 percent of market cap in our data set in 
2020, while the top five in banking held 18 percent. Also in 2020, new businesses held 33 percent of 
all market cap in payments; in banking, the share was just 3 percent. 

Or compare the biopharmaceuticals arena with traditional pharmaceuticals. Economic profit in this 
arena increased more than sevenfold, from $6 billion in 2005 to $42 billion in 2019. By contrast, 
economic profit in traditional pharmaceuticals increased by only 10 percent, from $42 billion in 2005 
to $46 billion in 2019. The biopharmaceuticals industry also offered more opportunities to new 
entrants, which had 33 percent of market cap in 2020—a much larger share than the 14 percent new 
businesses held in traditional pharmaceuticals. 

And consider the EV industry alongside the traditional auto industry. In 2005, the fledgling EV 
industry had very few players, but by 2020, it received all of its $101 billion in revenues from new 
businesses. It was also highly concentrated: the five largest EV players accounted for 94 percent of 
market cap, far more than the 30 percent share held by the five largest traditional auto companies.

Finally, consider the e-commerce and retail industries. Between 2005 and 2019, e-commerce’s 
economic profit grew from $1.1 billion to $5.6 billion, compared with retail’s growth from $20.2 
billion to $32 billion. E-commerce also experienced explosive growth during the COVID-19 crisis, 
generating $16 billion in economic profit in 2020. In 2020, the five biggest e-commerce companies 
held 73 percent of the industry’s market cap, and new businesses controlled 52 percent. In retail, the 
five biggest companies accounted for just 44 percent of market cap, and new businesses had only 
11 percent.

§ § §

In this chapter, we identified industries that became arenas from 2005 to 2020, and we explored 
the ways in which they differed from other industries. We have shown that arenas outperform their 
counterparts in R&D investment inflow and value creation, provide more opportunity to new entrants, 
and tend to become more concentrated. In chapter 2, we examine how the arenas of the present 
emerged and grew from 2005 to 2020 and discuss how that understanding can help us spot the 
emergence of the arenas of tomorrow.

The arena-creation potion

To understand how our present-day arenas came into being, we need to take a time machine to go 
back about two decades. What would we have seen? Let’s look at four industries that became arenas 
from the early to mid-2000s.

In 2005, e-commerce had a market cap in our data set of only $87 billion. The industry reported 
revenues of $15 billion, accounting for only 2.5 percent of overall US retail sales. Amazon had 
recorded rapid revenue growth, from $16 million in 1996 to $8.5 billion in 2005. It was investing in 
its merchant network, started in 2000, and in its fulfillment services, launched in 2006. At the same 
time, the world was becoming more digital, as US internet penetration increased from 9 percent in 
1995 to 68 percent in 2005.14 Other players were also making moves: eBay acquired PayPal in 2002, 
and Shopify launched its alternative to the Amazon ecosystem in 2006. By 2020, e-commerce had a 
market cap of $3.3 trillion and revenues of $888 billion in our data set.15

The video and audio entertainment industry, which had a market cap of $256 billion in 2005, 
also began to transform. At the beginning of this period, content producers, such as Disney and 
Paramount, distributed their productions through traditional movie theaters and through DVD 
rentals offered by the likes of Blockbuster and Netflix, as well as broadcast and cable TV. The 
subscription model began to emerge in 2003, when Netflix filed a patent for subscription rental 
services for physical DVDs. In the next few years, the company grappled with Blockbuster over 
pricing and delivery models. The Netflix subscriber base continued to grow, from 1.4 million in 2003 
to 7.3 million in 2007. Revenues grew, too, from $272 million in 2003 to $1.2 billion in 2007.16 In 2007, 
Netflix launched online streaming, now its primary business model. By 2020, the video and audio 
entertainment industry’s market cap reached $1.5 trillion.

In 2005, the semiconductor industry’s market cap was just $642 billion. That year, Intel launched 
its first multicore processor, and in 2006, it announced the construction of a production facility in 
Vietnam, its biggest to date. Today’s widely used Intel Core i7 processor debuted in 2008. Meanwhile, 
the semiconductor manufacturer TSMC started to strengthen its leadership in the foundry segment. 
From 2000 to 2005, the company had started production in four new fabrication plants, with an 
associated initial investment of about $14 billion. TSMC started to spend 20 percent more on R&D 
than its three biggest competitors combined in 2008. By 2020, the semiconductor industry was a 
$3.5 trillion arena by market cap. 

The EV industry also started to coalesce into an arena in the early 2000s. The first modern lithium-
ion batteries were commercialized in the early 1990s in Japan, and by the early 2000s, battery packs 
capable of powering a car were assembled. Honda and Toyota entered the hybrid EV market in this 
period. Tesla began development of its Roadster in 2004. It launched in 2008 and was the first pure 
EV, with a range of more than 240 miles per charge. By 2020, the EV industry had a market cap of 
$941 billion.

In the early 2000s, perfectly predicting the path of these four industries would have been an 
impossible task. In hindsight, we observed interesting developments related to growth, investment, 
and new competitors happening in these arenas. How did the primordial ooze of these early 
indicators bubble up into an arena?

In this chapter, we describe the inner processes transforming industries into arenas that generate 
growth and dynamism and examine how those characteristics manifested themselves in the 12 
arenas of today.

The arena-creation potion and escalatory competition
What are the elements that give rise to an industry that displays high growth and high dynamism? 
We have identified three that, when combined, become what we call an “arena-creation potion.” The 
three ingredients are: technology or business model step changes, an escalation mechanism for 
investments, and a large or growing addressable market (which investors often refer to as the total 
addressable market, or TAM).

The three ingredients emerge in a certain order. We observed that arena formation starts with a 
technology or business model step change that encourages players to invest rapidly in quality. These 
escalating investments constitute the second ingredient. The players then undertake the cycle of 
continual investment to tap a large or growing addressable market. However, while there is a causal 
order to the three ingredients, there is also an unpredictable element of time as players churn, invest, 
and innovate until the latent demand of a large TAM is unlocked and an arena is formed.

Technology and business model step changes
The first potion ingredient is a technology or business model step change that fundamentally 
transforms how products and services are developed or delivered. Performance for a given 
technology (for example, how many transistors can fit into a square centimeter of silicon, or how much 
energy per kilogram can be stored in a battery) and adoption of a technology (what percentage of a 
given market is using that technology) are often modeled as idealized S-curves. When a technology 
capability undergoes a step change, adoption starts off slowly, reaches an inflection point when it 
accelerates, then begins to plateau as the technology or business model reaches maturity. At the top 
of the S-curve, the competitive game tends to settle into mature markets competition (contests with 
a few large competitors and relatively high barriers to entry), but the intensity of competition among 
them can persist, as we describe later in this chapter.

In practice, technology capabilities and adoption don’t always follow this idealized S-curve form 
perfectly, but the conceptual pattern is a useful framework. We observe technology step changes 
in our arenas when a technology innovation is of a substantial magnitude and puts the trajectory of 
performance on a new S-curve, as we saw with EVs.

We also observed step changes in business models in our arenas. These were often enabled by 
technology and caused by innovations that shift the commercial models (in other words, who pays 
for what and how) related to products or services, disrupting existing market structures, as with 
e-commerce and video and audio entertainment (streaming). You could also think of the adoption of 
business model innovations as following S-curves.

In the semiconductor industry, we saw both technology and business model step changes. This 
industry regularly sees technology step changes in the form of “node resets”—broadly, the process of 
building new generations of semiconductors with smaller transistors and other components. Over the 
first two decades of the 2000s, semiconductor technology jumped to smaller and smaller node sizes, 
effectively resetting the technology curve about every five years, in line with the exponential increase 
in the number of transistors per integrated circuit predicted by Moore’s law.

These regular industry-wide shifts to smaller and smaller node sizes caused the markets for larger 
node sizes to decline over time. In 2000, production spanned the 0.13-to-0.5-micron (130-to-500-
nanometer) range. In just ten years, only a small segment of the market was producing chips with 
nodes larger than 90 nanometers (Exhibit 11).17

Over the same time span, much of the industry adopted a “fabless” business model, with some 
companies handling the design and sale of semiconductors while outsourcing fabrication of 
the physical microchips to other companies called foundries. Some players, including Nvidia, 
Qualcomm, and Broadcom, specialized in designing microchips that served specific purposes.18 
Others, such as TSMC, specialized in manufacturing chips designed by fabless players, while ASML 
and others focused on the specialized equipment used to make chips (for instance, for lithography). 
As a result, the industry underwent a dramatic shift from vertically integrated business models 
to disaggregated specialization. However, some players, notably Intel, maintained a vertically 
integrated design and manufacture model for microchips, while sourcing the tools in their factories 
from specialized suppliers.

Escalation mechanism for investments
The second potion ingredient can be observed in the type of investments players have  
incentives to make, namely escalatory investments. Escalatory investments have two mutually 
compounding consequences. 

First, the returns of these investments increase with scale. These outlays not only grow output but 
fundamentally change and improve a company’s production function. In other words, they increase 
quality, not just quantity. As a result, these investments can boost margins and rapidly expand market 
share, because customers want the best product. By contrast, so-called ticket-to-play investments, 
such as simply opening new factories and branches that aren’t fundamentally different from existing 
ones, do not influence market position as much. 

Second, players begin an arms race in which they iteratively invest to scale and scale to invest. When 
one player improves quality and starts to gain more profits and market share, other companies 
respond and invest more to improve the quality of their product to compete. The more each player 
invests, the more competitive the race becomes, creating an escalatory cycle. We expand on this 
intense mode of competition in the next section.

Escalatory investments are features of specific types of spending, such as marketing, R&D, 
and certain capital expenditures. These are the kinds of investments that advance a company’s 
capabilities and tend to improve long-term margins. For example, when e-commerce platforms invest 
in marketing to attract more customers and increase the platforms’ value for merchants, the cost of 
mass marketing to customers shrinks relative to revenue potential, expanding per-customer margins. 
Biopharma companies often invest in novel R&D methodologies, such as AI-driven bioinformatics, to 
improve clinical success rates and return on investment (ROI). Once a drug is produced and marketed, 
the cost of R&D investment is spread across that drug’s sales. Acquisitions can be a form of R&D 
investment when they provide access to the capabilities and proprietary assets of the acquired 
companies. In many instances, an underlying network effect makes investments attractive for arena 
companies (a process we discuss later in this chapter). Furthermore, these types of investments are 
not one-offs when they are escalatory—they are continual and increasing.19

Of course, not all investment-intensive industries exhibit this escalatory dynamic. In the steel 
industry, building a new plant might increase overall profits, but only by increasing capacity and sales 
within the same production function. However, e-commerce players like Amazon, as they optimize 
last-mile delivery to the home, fundamentally change not just their scale but their unique capabilities, 
too (see sidebar “Tech giants made massive escalatory investments”).

Sidebar: Tech giants made  
massive escalatory investments

If we look at six of the biggest players 
in several arenas, the magnitude of 
escalatory investments is enormous. These 
companies—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, 
Microsoft, and TSMC—collectively invested 
$13 billion in capital expenditures and R&D in 
2005. By 2020, that number had increased 
20-fold, reaching almost $250 billion, a 
22 percent year-on-year growth rate. By 

comparison, US capital expenditures rose 
3 percent and R&D spending increased 
7 percent in the same period.1 This pattern 
of investments has continued since 2020, 
with all six companies maintaining 15 to 
23 percent CAGRs on their R&D expenses 
and capital expenditures from 2020 to 2023.

Beyond the total size of investments, 
the allocation between R&D and capital 
expenditures also showed how investment 
strategies evolved. For example, Microsoft’s 
capital investments were only $1 billion in 

2005, while the company reported spending 
$6 billion on R&D. By 2020, its capital 
expenditures had reached $15 billion, not 
far behind the $19 billion for R&D. Alphabet, 
on the other hand, went from reporting 
roughly equal amounts for R&D and capital 
expenditures in 2005 to reporting nearly 
30 percent more on R&D than on capital 
expenditures by 2020, and nearly 40 percent 
more by 2023 (exhibit).

To illustrate this dynamic within an arena, we looked at four of the largest players in our sample of 
cloud-services companies from 2015 to 2020 to determine whether escalating investments—as 
indicated by the level of capital expenditures—correlated with outsize revenue market share 
(Exhibit 12). In 2015, AWS was the market leader with 23 percent of revenue market share, followed 
by Microsoft at 16 percent. In 2020, AWS still led in revenues with 37 percent market share, and 
Microsoft followed with 21 percent. The continual escalation of these investments is clear: AWS and 
Microsoft pulled further and further ahead to first gain and then at least maintain their market share.

Large or growing addressable market
Technological and business model step changes open demand pools that are conducive to escalatory 
investments. As a result, these changes unlock large and often rapidly growing addressable 
markets—our third potion ingredient. Generally speaking, there are two ways for companies to reach 
large or fast-growing markets: either they play in already sizable markets where demand growth 
continues to outstrip the rest of the economy or they displace share of an existing large market with a 
superior product or service.

Companies in the first category took advantage of technology and business model step changes 
to accelerate value creation in fast-growing, established industries, which typically had revenue 
pools of more than $100 billion in 2005 but were subject to escalatory investments that improved 
efficiencies or broadened capabilities. These arenas included biopharmaceuticals, industrial 
electronics, information-enabled business services, mobile and consumer electronics, payments, 
semiconductors, software, and video and audio entertainment. Together, they recorded 5 to 
13 percent revenue CAGRs from 2005 to 2020. By comparison, the global economy expanded about 
3 percent a year during the same period.20 For these arenas, the growth driver of the market was 
often an expansion of existing demand brought about by digitization and associated globalization. 
In 2020, 60 percent of revenues earned by the companies in these arenas came from outside their 
home countries.

Companies in the second category achieved rapid growth by launching novel categories of products 
or services, taking shares from existing markets.21 While companies in the first category used 
technology and business model step changes to accelerate growth in existing industries, those in 
the second category created new industries, which captured growth by eating into the demand from 
existing markets. These arenas include cloud services, consumer internet, e-commerce, and EVs. 
Their revenue grew at a 13 to 33 percent CAGR from 2005 to 2020.

In this group, digitization often created a superior value proposition. The worldwide adoption of 
internet connectivity allowed e-commerce players to more seamlessly connect buyers and sellers 
across the globe, providing the opportunity for customers to purchase goods anytime, anywhere 
with their electronic devices, rather than through traditional physical retail channels. Digitization 
also transformed video and audio entertainment, and streaming in particular, by shifting media 
consumption from movie theaters and physical CDs to homes and mobile devices. Players were able 
to offer the added flexibility of content options and scheduling to consumers. We further discuss the 
importance of digitization later in this chapter.

We have discussed the three elements of the arena-creation potion: a technological or business 
model step change, escalatory investments, and a large or growing addressable market. We 
observed that the combination of these three ingredients, over time, leads to the formation of arenas. 
Next, we expand on the new competitive game unique to arenas when these three ingredients 
coalesce, which we call an escalatory mode of competition.

The three ingredients result in an escalatory mode of competition
Arenas produce a unique competitive tussle—an escalatory mode of competition—which results in 
high growth and high dynamism.

Escalatory competition is the industry-level consequence that occurs when the three potion 
elements come together, resulting in individual companies facing escalatory investment incentives. 
As alluded to above, it is characterized by arms-race-style contests in which players continually 
invest in their products, advertising, and operations because a technological or business model step 
change has disrupted the industry and unleashed latent demand.

To compete for or even maintain market  
share, companies need to continually  
increase investments and improve  
their capabilities.

As arena companies invest more in capabilities and the quality of their products improves, their 
profit eventually rises. They achieve this by increasing customers’ willingness to pay (with product 
improvements or advertising, for example), by reducing costs (by making step-change improvements 
in customer acquisition costs, for instance), or by growing volumes (for example, by leveraging 
network effects). Further, advancing capabilities tends to allow companies to expand their economic 
catchment zones: they can now sell products and services beyond old boundaries of geographies or 
categories. 

The competitive landscape changes as an arena moves up the S-curve of technical capability and 
adoption. Initially, the possibility of translating innovation to better capabilities and rapid market 
share can pull in new entrants at the beginning of the S-curve. Escalatory competition then tends 
to occur during the phase of rapid growth. This movement of an industry along the S-curve marks 
high levels of growth and competitive dynamism with major market share shifts, both of which are 
hallmarks of an arena. Eventually the escalatory investment dynamic can put leaders out of reach 
in the plateauing phase of the S-curve as new market players may find it increasingly challenging 
to compete with the capabilities that incumbents have developed, limiting the number of players, 
although they could continue to compete vigorously with one another.

There are two other general modes of competition. Simple competition features low barriers to 
entry and minor competitive advantages. Mature markets competition occurs when a few large 
players capture a significant portion of market share. What distinguishes escalatory competition 
from the other modes is that players are required to keep improving product quality, enabled by new 
technologies and rewarded by large addressable markets, intensifying the battle for market share. To 
compete for or even maintain market share, investments and capability-building must be continual; 
players that do not match the velocity of investments would eventually be unable to compete. Other 
modes of competition do not result in this kind of escalatory dynamic (see sidebar “The differences 
between the general modes of competition”).

Sidebar: The differences  
between the general modes  
of competition

Three general modes of competition 
demonstrate why escalatory competition is 
different and is characteristic of arenas.

In the first mode, simple competition, barriers 
to entry are low and individual players cannot 
unilaterally move prices. This is the case with 
a neighborhood laundromat or locksmith: 
a minimal investment is required to enter, 
the technology is well understood, there are 
many small players, competition is high, and 
the competitive advantages, if they exist, 
are minor.

The second mode, mature markets 
competition, is a model in which a few large 
companies have captured a significant 
portion of the market share. This often 
occurs at the plateauing end of the S-curve, 
where technological performance or 
adoption reaches maturity. New rivals 
are limited by high barriers to entry like 
a minimum efficient scale or high capital 
investment. In this mode, the parameters 
of the competitive game seem settled for 
some time, with established business models 
as well as physical or intangible assets 
and capabilities. A prominent example is 
the long-haul commercial airline industry, 
where high levels of up-front investment in 
aircraft are necessary to operate at scale, 
while regulatory requirements and limited 
landing slots constrain the entry of new 
players. As a result, competition tends to 
revolve around pricing shifts. Under mature 
markets competition, the market tends 
toward equilibrium, although competitive 
escalations, technological or business 

model step changes, or both can disturb 
that equilibrium. 

The third mode, escalatory competition, is 
characterized by an arms-race dynamic in 
which players continually invest to advance 
their capabilities. In his 1991 book Sunk Costs 
and Market Structure, the economist John 
Sutton presented a theory that helps explain 
the difference between mature markets 
competition and escalatory competition. He 
asserts that company investments can be 
described as either exogenous sunk costs or 
endogenous sunk costs. Exogenous sunk-
cost investments are those that any player 
needs to make to enter the market. Examples 
include the cost of building a factory or 
of setting up a logistics and distribution 
network, or the heavy capital investments 
required in the commercial airline 
industry. Endogenous sunk costs are fixed 
investments that improve long-term profit 
by reducing cost or increasing customers’ 
willingness to pay. These investments are 
classified as endogenous as they tend to 
depend or build upon investments already 
made. Think of product improvements or 
marketing campaigns that allow companies 
like Apple or Samsung to maintain the price 
of their products, or a process innovation 
that optimizes production performance (for 
example, investments by Intel, TSMC, or 
Nvidia that permit the company to efficiently 
produce at smaller nodes). The cost savings 
that companies derive from economies 
of scale are typically the returns from 
endogenous sunk-cost investments.

Escalatory competition occurs when 
markets are suited to endogenous sunk-
cost investments. In such cases, incumbent 
companies will keep investing in R&D, 
marketing, or capital expenditures. As 

a result, current players advance their 
capabilities and can even expand to other 
markets. The most dynamic competitively 
escalatory industries—and hence arenas—
are often found at the beginning of the 
S-curve, when technological or business 
model step changes occur, or in the 
succeeding, middle phase of rapid growth in 
the S-curve.

For example, we observed competitive 
escalatory dynamics in the consumer 
internet arena, especially in the early years 
of Meta as the company continued to invest 
in capabilities and expanded demand from 
2005 to 2020. Acquisitions made by large 
players are sometimes signs of mature 
markets competition, so Meta’s acquisitions 
of WhatsApp and Instagram might have 
suggested that the consumer internet arena 
was reaching an S-curve plateau. But we also 
see innovations that create new dynamism: 
TikTok, for example, started to meaningfully 
compete in the consumer internet arena after 
it launched in China in 2016 and expanded 
internationally in 2017. By 2020, TikTok had 
more than 1 billion users, while Facebook had 
almost 2 billion. New business models and 
redefined industry lines may produce the 
arenas of tomorrow. We discuss this further 
in chapter 3 and in the compendium that 
follows it.

Other industries, including long-haul 
commercial air travel, also underwent  
shifts in competitive modes before our 
2005–20 focus period. This market featured 
rapid innovation, high investment, and 
substantial market share reshuffling before 
a series of mergers and acquisitions led to 
the current stage of quality, especially for the 
largest players.

Observing the potion in the arenas of today
In this chapter, we’ve described the three ingredients of the arena-creation potion and explained 
why they result in high growth and high dynamism. In this section, we explore the importance of 
digitization in enabling the rise of the three potion ingredients and how these ingredients coalesced 
to create exceptional growth and dynamism in each of our arenas of today. We also explore metrics 
that could have signaled the emergence of these arenas (see sidebar “Early markers of arenas”).

Digitization has been a primary  
force in expanding the number of  
industries where an escalatory 
competitive dynamic could develop.

These investment markers were telling 
indicators for several candidate arenas and 
helped guide us in estimating the arenas that 
might eventually emerge. However, like all 
predictive markers, they had limitations.

Sidebar: Early markers of arenas

 — Heightened value expectations. We 

Beyond the arena-creation potion, we also 
explored metrics, such as capital flows, 
valuations, and revenue growth, that could 
signal the presence of arenas in their 
early stages. We discovered that these 
early markers varied in reliability but were 
nevertheless helpful in pointing to potential 
areas where arenas could emerge when they 
supplemented the three potion ingredients. 
What would these metrics have told us in 
2005 about arenas in their infancy? We 
examined the following (Exhibit):

 — Venture capital. A majority of VC flows—
60 to 70 percent—went to arena-linked 
companies, but just four arenas drove 
this large share: biopharmaceuticals, 
consumer internet, semiconductors, 
and software. Most arenas received 
less than 3 percent of the total flows of 
venture capital in any given year from 
2003 to 2007.

might expect valuations (measured here 
as the ratio of enterprise value to net 
operating profit less adjusted taxes, or 
NOPLAT) to predict arena emergence. 
We did find evidence that in any given 
year from 2003 to 2007, the majority 
of arenas were in the upper half of the 
distribution of industries for valuation 
multiples. Only biopharmaceuticals had 
multiples that were consistently lower 
than industry medians. We also looked 
at the overall EV/NOPLAT multiples of 
arenas, which were generally higher 
than those of other industries in  
this period.

 — Revenue growth. By definition, arenas 
had higher revenue growth than the 
economy over the 2005–20 period. We 
also examined year-on-year revenue 
growth for each arena in the years around 
the beginning of our period of analysis, 
from 2003 to 2008. As expected, we 
found that a majority of them grew faster 
than our overall sample.

Digitization enables network effects and globalization
Digitization has been a primary force in the simultaneous rise of the three potion ingredients by 
expanding the number of industries where an escalatory competitive dynamic could develop. For 
example, brick-and-mortar retailers face high hurdles to reducing unit costs through investments. A 
traditional retailer’s marketing spend is only effective in the physical catchment of the stores, but an 
e-commerce retailer can spend into a much less constrained addressable market

Network effects, which increase the value of a product or service as more people use it, were 
accelerated by digitization in many arenas, including consumer internet, e-commerce, consumer 
electronics, and software.

For example, social media companies’ networks become more valuable to users as they add more 
contacts on the platform. Search engines become more accurate and more valuable as more users 
engage with them and generate data that can be used to improve search results. E-commerce 
marketplace platforms have a two-way network-effect dynamic as more merchants increase the 
platform’s value for customers and vice versa. For consumer electronics and the underlying software 
that runs them (such as iOS and Android), a mutually reinforcing network effect connects developers 
and users: more users entice developers to produce more applications, which in turn attracts 
more users. 

Globalization of some industries was also a consequence of digitization. Products and services that 
would traditionally have local or regional reach are now accessible anywhere. This is particularly 
obvious for internet-dependent arenas, such as cloud services, consumer internet, e-commerce, 
and software. In the video and audio entertainment arena, even before streaming became 
commonplace, globalization had already expanded consumers’ ability to access media, as seen with 
K-pop’s rise to international prominence. Globalization also uniquely influenced the information-
enabled business services arena by sparking accelerated growth in the knowledge economy, which 
prompted companies in this area to boost their investments in capabilities to address a newly global 
addressable market.

The three potion ingredients in the arenas of today
Here we examine how the three potion ingredients have contributed to creating today’s arenas, 
discussed in descending order of 2020 revenues.

Industrial electronics. This arena consists of two groups of companies: contract manufacturers, 
such as Foxconn, Jabil, and Flex, and OEMs, such as Panasonic and Schneider Electric.

For contract manufacturers, the large-scale outsourcing of manufacturing was the significant 
business model step change that made this industry an arena. High-revenue players, such as 
Foxconn, benefited from the manufacturing outsourcing of big brands, such as Apple and Sony. As a 
result, contract manufacturers often escalate investments in capital expenditures in line with growing 
manufacturing capacity and in R&D to build capabilities as they meet demand. 

We can see the escalatory nature of the capital investments by the largest contract manufacturers 
(Exhibit 13). From 2005 to 2020, Foxconn’s outlays were associated with higher revenue growth 
than was the case for its two closest competitors. In 2005, Foxconn had more revenues than Jabil 
and Flex, and it devoted a high share of revenues, 5 percent, to capital expenditures. Jabil and Flex 
spent 3 and 2 percent, respectively. Foxconn’s continued customer commitments allowed it to 
continue this high allocation of capital expenditures as its competitors trailed behind: Jabil’s capital 
expenditure allocation reached 5 percent of revenues only in 2015. Foxconn’s revenues continued 
to outpace those of competitors, and by 2020, the company spent only 1.2 percent of revenues on 
capital expenditures (capital expenditures still grew, but not as fast as revenues), while Jabil spent 
3.6 percent of revenues.

To some extent, the capital expenditure investments by the contract manufacturers were as much 
about boosting quantity as quality, and less escalatory in that sense.22 For OEMs, the increasing 
digitization of physical devices and equipment was a technological step change that spurred growth. 
In this case, OEM players escalated both capital investment and R&D to develop novel manufacturing 
processes and the software embedded in these digitally enabled products. For example, Panasonic 
announced in 2006 that it would stop manufacturing analog televisions and concentrate on digital 
televisions. Siemens invested about $10 billion throughout the 2010s to strengthen capabilities in its 
Digital Factory.23 Increasing demand for downstream products raised revenues for these OEMs as 
well as the revenues for upstream electronic components produced by contract manufacturers. The 
industrialization of developing economies accounted for a large part of the demand growth in this 
arena. In our sample, this arena was the largest by revenues in both 2005 ($389 billion) and 2020 
($987 billion).

E-commerce. A business model step change enabled the e-commerce arena as retail sales 
increasingly took place online instead of in physical stores. This was made possible by the growing 
penetration of personal computers, mobile devices, and internet connectivity. E-commerce players 
escalated investments in physical distribution networks to improve delivery cost margins and delivery 
times, increasing customer satisfaction and their value. 

Players also escalated investments in marketing to acquire more customers, as scale gives 
companies more purchasing power to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers. Marketplace and 
platform players further escalated these marketing investments to acquire both customers and 
merchants, which enables a mutually reinforcing network effect: customers find more value in a 
platform with many merchants and vice versa. This network effect is an important part of Amazon’s 
“flywheel effect,” which incorporates escalatory investments in pricing and customer experience.24

In market size and growth, the e-commerce market disrupted the already large traditional retail 
market, whose revenues grew from $1.2 trillion in 2005 to $2.5 trillion in 2020, a growth rate of 5 
percent. Meanwhile, e-commerce’s revenues grew from $15 billion in 2005 to $890 billion in 2020, a 
31 percent growth rate. E-commerce’s share of total retail sales in the United States was 2.5 percent 
in 2005. By 2020, it was 15 percent.

Consumer electronics. The evolution of mobile phones into smartphones was a technology step 
change in this arena that resulted from escalatory investments in R&D aimed at integrating multiple 
new technologies—including semiconductors, digital displays, cameras, batteries, and software 
operating systems—into one compelling solution. 

The shift to smartphones also expanded mobile phones’ value beyond simple communication tools 
to multipurpose devices, creating software ecosystems. The emergence of these software platforms 
created a business model step change: the arrival of application stores and application revenues. 
Apple launched its application store in 2008, and Google introduced its own in 2012. To acquire 
customers for their platforms and build brand loyalty, players escalated investments in marketing 
(for example, Samsung spent $3 billion, or 3.8 percent of total revenues, on marketing in 2005, and 
$9.7 billion, or 4.8 percent of revenues, in 2020). 

Players also escalated R&D investments intended to constantly integrate software and hardware 
innovations. Investments in underlying operating systems (iOS and Android, Mac OS and Windows) 
also escalated as players sought to accelerate network-effect dynamics for developers and users: 
mobile operating systems capabilities attract more developers to develop applications, and more 
applications attract more users. This creates an incentive for developers to produce apps for 
operating systems with more users. This arena accessed the large and growing demand for mobile 
devices. In 2005, only 34 percent of the global population had any kind of mobile phone; by 2020, 
67 percent of the global population had a smartphone. In addition, the global population grew 
20 percent over this period.

Semiconductors. As discussed above, this industry experienced constant step changes of 
technology S-curves in the form of node resets. For semiconductor manufacturers, including 
foundries and integrated design and manufacturing players, investments escalated to stay on 
the cutting edge of each successive node. Tool suppliers also escalated R&D to create tools to 
manufacture smaller and smaller features; for example, extreme ultraviolet lithography required 
billions of dollars over decades. Fabless players that designed semiconductor products escalated 
R&D investments in the same ways as software companies: constant innovation was required to 
create new products and enhance existing ones to remain competitive. Semiconductors’ revenues in 
our sample nearly tripled from $194 billion in 2005 to $574 billion in 2020, driven by rising demand 
for computing systems (PCs and servers) and mobile devices.

Video and audio entertainment. This arena’s business model step change was the development 
of on-demand streaming of video and audio, which offered increased accessibility of content 
unbounded by time or physical constraints, disrupting the way traditional media was consumed. To 
attract more customers, players escalated investments in content development, such as licensing 
material and in-house production. With scale, players also had more purchasing power to negotiate 
terms with content creation ecosystems, whether licensing content or producing it in-house. Further, 
R&D investments escalated to improve the customer experience, for instance by leveraging customer 
data—using recommendation algorithms, for example—to drive customer satisfaction and retention. 
Global consumption of media grew over this period, with digital entertainment as a driving force. This 
arena’s revenues more than tripled, from $135 billion in 2005 to $407 billion by 2020.

Consumer internet. The global rise of the internet and broader digitization created the opportunity 
to serve consumer needs through services like social media and web search. Though membership-
based internet access providers such as AOL were still common in 2005, consumer internet players 
began to implement a step change in their business model. This change enabled these services to 
rapidly acquire large user bases that were monetized through advertising and sold through online 
auctions. Consumer internet players were also able to offer marketers a new business model of ads 
that link fees to clicks rather than impressions. Another business model innovation was the new 
ability to hyper-target customer segments that traditional platforms like print publications, cable 
TV, and billboards could not achieve. In terms of investments, players escalated marketing spending 
to accelerate user acquisition and enable network effects. More users and more collected data 
increased the value of platforms by helping search engines refine results. For social media players, 
each additional user increased the value of the network for other users. For search engines and social 
media platforms, network effects amplified this virtuous cycle of consumers using players’ platforms. 

Biopharma. The introduction of drug discovery and production advancements, such as 
recombinant DNA technology, genome sequencing, and other platform technologies, presented 
new developmental paths for drugs that provide more targeted and effective therapies for patients. 
The escalation of investments in R&D was driven to a large extent by a need to discover and develop 
drugs that either were more effective than existing therapies or treated additional indications. For 
example, therapeutic-area-focused biotech companies continually invested to take advantage of 
technological curves, including AI-driven bioinformatics. Many of these companies had higher ROI 
and clinical success rates than traditional pharmaceutical businesses’ R&D and in-house discovery 
engines. Due to the long runway of R&D-to-market cycles in pharmaceuticals, one could argue 
that this competitive dynamic may have begun as early as the 1990s, with revenue growth from 
biopharmaceuticals becoming materially observable from 2005 to 2020.

Global pharmaceuticals revenues were $601 billion in 2005. That figure more than doubled to reach 
$1.3 trillion by 2020, with biopharmaceutical businesses’ share of the pool growing from an estimated 
20 percent in 2005 to 50 percent by 2020, indicating that the lines have already blurred between 
biopharmaceuticals and pharmaceuticals. Biopharma revenues grew 13 percent year-on-year from 
2005 to 2020.

Software. The emergence of software as a service (SaaS) caused step changes in business models 
in this arena. For example, in 2013, Microsoft launched Office 365 (after a beta that started in 2010), 
and Adobe transitioned its Creative Suite into the Creative Cloud. Players escalated investments in 
R&D (for example, collecting usability data or enhancing features) to retain customers and launch 
new products or features to drive lifetime customer value. This trajectory was followed by both 
customer relationship management software players, such as Salesforce, and enterprise resource 
planning software players, such as Oracle and SAP. Salesforce spent $9.8 million on R&D in its 
2005 fiscal year. By 2020, that had grown to $2.8 billion. Oracle invested $1.5 billion in R&D in 2005

and $6.1 billion in 2020. SAP invested €1.1 billion in R&D in 2005, which increased to €4.5 billion by 
2020. As with other arenas, the digitization wave spurred growth: the number of software use cases 
increased, computing power available in the cloud multiplied, and higher-performance internet 
connectivity made SaaS feasible for more customers. Software revenues grew 12 percent year-on-
year, from $64 billion in 2005 to $341 billion in 2020.

Information-enabled business services. The emergence of outsourcing and offshoring services, 
including business process outsourcing and outsourcing IT and knowledge services, was a major 
business model step change in this arena. In addition, the increasing sophistication of data analytics 
capabilities, enhanced computing power, improved communications and networking technology, 
and digitization encouraged players to pivot to IT asset-based service delivery to supplement 
talent. Investments through acquisitions, primarily for the addition of new capabilities, talent, and 
data, escalated in this arena. For example, ADP completed 28 acquisitions from 2005 to 2020, 
and the credit-scoring agencies Equifax, Experian, and Transunion collectively acquired about 
150 companies in that time.25 The expansion of this arena was driven by the proliferation of the 
knowledge economy that followed in the wake of globalization and by the growing need to integrate 
technology into global businesses. Our sample shows that revenues in this arena almost tripled, from 
$53 billion in 2005 to $154 billion by 2020 at a 7 percent year-on-year growth rate.

Payments. Digitization caused a step change in payment systems by enabling them to be faster, 
more convenient, and often cheaper than offline payment solutions. As with e-commerce, players 
escalated investments in marketing to acquire merchants and customers, which created mutually 
reinforcing network effects. There was also escalation in R&D to enhance product features such 
as better security, fraud detection, and customer experience that enhanced the value proposition 
for merchants and customers. The payments industry was already large and growing, with global 
revenues that rose from $493 billion in 2005 to $1.6 trillion in 2020, representing growth of 8 percent 
year-on-year. The majority of the growth was from emerging markets, such as China. In 2020, more 
than half of global payments revenues were from the Asia–Pacific region.

Cloud services. Cloud services exemplify a business model step change, because the companies 
offered computing and storage as operating expenses, freeing customers from rigid capital 
expenditures based on purchasing hardware. This business model provided flexible IT infrastructure 
solutions on a pay-for-what-you-use basis. The widespread deployment and penetration of the 
internet helped hasten the adoption of cloud services. Cloud-services players escalated investments 
in capital spending to build more data centers. They also improved economics of scale and price 
competitiveness and offered efficiencies, such as proximity and energy efficiency, to their customers. 
There was some R&D investment escalation as these players offered more value-added services, 
including advanced security options and analytics, as well as APIs for developers to ease integration 
with customers’ systems. This arena disrupted the pool of corporate spending in physical IT 
infrastructure: global IT spending mostly came from traditional on-premises solutions in 2005, but by 
2020, cloud-services spending accounted for $370 billion, or more than a third of the $1.1 trillion in 
global outlays.26

EVs. Rapidly improving battery and electric power train technology, as well as the ability to 
integrate these new technologies into one product, provided the technology step changes that 
led to an increasingly competitive market for EVs. The R&D investments for batteries, power train 
technology, and other production processes escalated to lower costs and increase performance. 
R&D investments also went toward improving other automotive technologies, including the 
ability to download software to vehicles, similar to the way application stores operate for mobile 
phones. Escalating outlays for marketing to convey competitive value to customers supplemented 
these investments.

The EV arena cut into the revenue pool of traditional ICE vehicles. That industry had $1.7 trillion 
in revenues in 2005, which grew to $2.4 trillion by 2020. By then, EVs had become a $100 billion 
revenue arena, equivalent to almost 5 percent of the established traditional automotive industry.

While other important industries stood out from 2005 to 2020, they did not show the outsize growth 
and dynamism that would qualify them as arenas. Our potion can help us understand why.

The apparel and luxury industry showed a relatively high industry share growth rate during this 
period—comparable to the biopharma and payments arenas—but displayed limited dynamism among 
the largest companies. This industry lacked a technology or business model step change of the same 
degree as the 12 arenas of today, one of the key ingredients of the potion. This meant that the same 
small group of players could vie for the growing demand pool in mature markets competition.

Conversely, oil and gas showed high dynamism with large share shifts among players while the 
industry share growth rate in this sector was far lower than the average in our overall sample: the 
market caps of oil and gas players grew at a 4 percent CAGR from 2005 to 2020, compared with 
average growth of 16 percent in our arenas. The industry experienced observable technology 
step changes, such as the advent of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in shale and other 
geological formations. However, oil and gas did not display an escalation mechanism for investments, 
another key potion element, and the huge capital outlays in the sector mostly go toward exogenous 
sunk costs, such as exploration and drilling of wells. This meant that growth was more linked to price 
changes from global events affecting supply and demand—such as the 2007–08 financial crisis, the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and the rapid proliferation of North American shale—as well as non-economic 
factors, than to an escalation of investments made by players.

Arenas do not start from scratch. While early signals may appear noisy, they can still be helpful 
in helping us identify the primordial ooze from which arenas emerge. The arena-creation potion 
described in this chapter and evident in the arenas of today can provide an initial guide for identifying 
potential arenas of tomorrow. We can begin by looking for early signs of S-curve step changes, the 
starting gun of a new escalatory competitive race. For this race to eventually lead to the creation of an 
arena, the three ingredients usually must be in place.

In chapter 3, we look at the potential arenas of tomorrow and how they might evolve. Given the 
dynamic nature of arena competition, our ability to speak with certainty about which arenas will 
emerge is limited. But using our potion and the theoretical framework we set out in this chapter, we 
can identify certain aspects of arenas and present potential scenarios for their size and competitive 
dynamics in the coming years.

The arenas of tomorrow

The arenas of today have brought sweeping change to our lives over the past two decades. The 
arenas of tomorrow are likely to bring even greater change in the years ahead.

In chapters 1 and 2, we looked at the past and explored how the arenas of today grew and evolved, 
propelled especially by digital technologies. In this chapter, we look toward the future to identify 
18 potential arenas of tomorrow that could exhibit high growth and high dynamism (see sidebar 
“How we defined the arenas of the future”). These arenas have the potential to transform our  
world in a number of areas, including transportation, healthcare, digital connectivity, energy,  
and entertainment.

In 2022, the industries we identified as the potential arenas of tomorrow took in $7.2 trillion in 
combined annual revenues. In our modeled scenarios, their revenues could grow to between 
$29 trillion and $48 trillion by 2040, at a CAGR of 8 to 11 percent from 2022 to 2040. For reference, 
the revenues of our arenas of today listed in chapter 1 climbed at a CAGR of 10 percent from 2005 to 
2020, while revenue in other industries increased at a 4 percent CAGR. When we apply the typical 
after-tax profit margins observed in these arenas, our estimates show that potential future arenas 
could generate $1.9 trillion to $6.1 trillion in profits by 2040 (Exhibit 14).27

The revenue of arenas could  
represent a growing share of  
global GDP: from 4 percent in  
2022 to 10 to 16 percent by 2040.

While the revenue and after-tax profit margin estimates broadly followed the same ranking as shown 
in Exhibit 14, the orders do deviate slightly due to business model differences. For example, if current 
profit margins persist, the semiconductor arena would generate profit margins of 20 to 25 percent, 
making it the third-largest arena by potential 2040 profit (when ranked by the higher range of 
estimates) though it is only the sixth-largest arena by 2040 revenue. By contrast, the EV arena, which 
ranks fourth by 2040 revenue (also ranked by the higher range of estimates), would rank seventh by 
potential 2040 profit if the industry’s profit margins continue at 4 to 10 percent. 

We also estimate that the revenue of arenas, converted into GDP terms, could represent a growing 
share of global GDP: from 4 percent in 2022 to 10 to 16 percent by 2040.28 This translates to a 18 
to 34 percent share of total GDP growth (Exhibit 15). This shift in GDP share and value creation is a 
hallmark of arenas. If we perform a similar analysis on our arenas of today, the revenues of our sample 
companies also increased their corresponding share of GDP, from 3 percent in 2005 to 9 percent 
in 2020.29 Capital flows also indicate the appeal of the arenas of tomorrow for investors. By our 
estimates, about a third of venture capital flows from 2020 to 2023 went to industries linked to our 
potential future arenas.30

With an internet penetration rate of 
just 35 percent, developing economies 
have large untapped potential for 
digital products and services.

In chapters 1 and 2, we showed how digitization was the main underlying force in the formation of 
the arena-creation potion for most of today’s 12 arenas. For our list of 18 potential future arenas, 
we identified four thematic “mega-forces” that will likely drive their future growth and dynamism: 
continued digitization, innovations in the physical world, the global energy transition, and a growing, 
more prosperous world.

First, the continually improving capabilities of digital technology could accelerate growth when 
the product is information or a digital interface, driven by companies’ continuing efforts to move 
workloads to the cloud, the growing complexity of cybersecurity needs, and the rapidly expanding 
capabilities of AI. The continued expansion of the internet in developing economies may also drive 
growth for arenas like e-commerce and digital advertising. For instance, internet penetration is 
estimated at 35 percent in developing economies today, compared with 80 percent in developed 
economies—a disparity that illustrates the large untapped potential for digital products and services 
in developing economies.31 Second, innovations are bringing new technologies to the physical world

with advancements such as robotics and shared autonomous vehicles. Third, the global energy 
transition and the underlying momentum to decarbonize are likely to boost demand for cleaner 
energy and products, including EVs, batteries, and nuclear fission power plants. Fourth, as the global 
population grows and becomes more prosperous, demand will grow for industries that address 
quality-of-life needs in areas ranging from healthcare to homes. 

We have identified three groups of arenas, differentiated by the way they become potential arenas 
of tomorrow (Exhibit 16). The first group, continuing arenas, is made up of four of the 12 arenas of 
today that we have identified as potential future arenas because they will likely continue to exhibit 
high growth and high dynamism. The second group, spin-off arenas, consists of specific portions of 
current arenas that are likely to have their own trajectories of high growth and high dynamism. The 
third group, emergent arenas, is made up of new industries that have high potential for growth and 
dynamism and have exhibited early signs that the arena-creation potion elements are coalescing. 
Together, these three groups of arenas make up our 18 potential future arenas. Other industries 
were also considered, such as those we designated as “ceasing” arenas and a set of industries 
that almost qualified as emergent arenas. We chose not to analyze these potential arenas in depth 
because of uncertainties about size and dynamism, the likelihood of the scenario, and the time 
frame for scaling.

Below we show how the potion ingredients—the key indicators that an arena may be forming—are 
already apparent in many cases, though depending on the arena’s stage of development some may 
be harder to discern than others. The 18 arenas, sorted into continuing, spin-off, and emergent 
groups and ordered by the upper end of potential revenue ranges for 2040, are as follows:32

Continuing arenas
Four of our 12 current arenas—e-commerce, electric vehicles, cloud services, and semiconductors—
are likely to become arenas of tomorrow. All four are in the middle phase of rapid growth in their 
S-curve of market adoption. Demand pools still have large headroom and could produce this growth, 
which is driven by the mega-forces of innovation and digitization.

E-commerce. This arena is continuing on the rapid phase of its S-curve of growth and is still 
anchored in the original business model step change, which was the online availability of retail sales. 
Nevertheless, other relevant business model resets could also spur growth in e-commerce, for 
example retail media networks, which are adjacent to the reset in another future arena, digital ads.33 
From mid-2020 to mid-2022, more than a dozen retailers debuted this new advertising revenue 
stream. Social commerce, which allows consumers to make purchases on social media apps, is 
another business model reset on the rise. In addition, e-commerce is expected to undergo more 
business model step changes by expanding further into large product categories such as healthcare 
and food.

Because e-commerce is a continuing arena, the escalatory investments in merchant and customer 
acquisition are likely to continue. Capital expenditures for last-mile delivery capabilities and 
investments in social media and payments integration are also likely to continue to escalate. A larger 
share of sales in developing markets and expansion into new product categories in developed 
markets are likely to sustain demand and drive the majority of e-commerce growth, effectively 
stretching this arena’s S-curve.

Electric vehicles. EVs, an arena of today, are likely to continue to be an arena for two reasons: 
continued growth as EVs capture an increasing share of the large and stable demand for passenger 
and commercial vehicles, and the new rising competition in the industry. The breakthrough of battery 
cell technology and its current scalability and commercialization is the technology step change in 
this continuing arena. R&D investments could continue to escalate as players, especially traditional 
automotive incumbents, increase their share of EV sales. EV sales could eventually take the lion’s 
share of overall passenger vehicle sales—in our estimates, from 18 percent in 2023 to between 82 
and 96 percent by 2040. 

Cloud services. The ongoing adoption of cloud services, a continuing arena of today, could generate 
$3 trillion of EBITDA increases for Forbes Global 2000 companies by 2030.34 AI cloud represents 
a technological step change in this arena, because new AI models require significant amounts of 
computational power, which could be supported by cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, the types of 
infrastructure and platform services, including AI-enabled capabilities, that cloud providers offer 
will likely continue to evolve. New data sovereignty regulations, such as requirements about where 
data centers must be located, are also generating a step change in business models, fostering the 
emergence of regional competitors.

The escalation of capital expenditures is likely to continue as in past decades, and R&D expenditures 
could also escalate as players try to develop more efficient cloud infrastructure. We estimate that 
the share of global IT spending on cloud services could grow from 8 percent in 2022 to between 19 
and 41 percent by 2040 as companies continue to migrate their computing and storage processes to 
the cloud.

Semiconductors. This current arena undergoes frequent technology step changes as 
manufacturers keep reducing the distance between chips’ transistors and shrinking the size of 
components, including the transistors themselves. Players are likely to continue to escalate R&D 
and capital expenditures for machinery in pursuit of node resets, but also to meet rising demand 
for computational power. For example, the need for high-performance chips could keep growing 
as cloud services companies double down on investments in graphics processing units and AI 
accelerators for computationally intensive tasks. 

Demand from four segments could drive the majority of the growth in semiconductors: computing 
and data storage, automotive, wireless communications, and industrial electronics. The requirements 
of AI and cloud services are likely to boost computing and data storage demand; driving assistance 
features, electric vehicles, and infotainment system components could propel automotive demand; 
the growing need for connected devices would increase wireless communications demand; and 
industries such as medical technology, automation, and electricity generation are likely to fuel 
industrial electronics demand.

arenas of the future

it on its own.

demand may shift between them over the 
coming decades.

As we explore a new set of arenas, it is worth 
revisiting the principles that guided our 
choice of the level of granularity we used to 
define them. Just as we did with our selection 
of arenas in chapters 1 and 2, we used supply-
and-demand considerations to determine the 
granularity level for the arenas of tomorrow. 
The supply perspective determined whether 
the players and the competitive landscape 
were relatively well defined, with similarities 
in underlying technology or business models 
where step changes can spark escalatory 
competition, while the demand perspective 
ensured that products and services were 
sufficiently similar or substitutable. In some 
cases, defining arenas as broader industries 
was sufficient; in other cases, identifying 
these arenas involved splitting off a fast-

For example, we considered three future 
arenas that could have some overlap, 
particularly on the demand side: digital 
ads, streaming video, and video games. 
Each has large and fast-growing markets, 
distinct business models, and well-defined 
competitive landscapes. Some of these 
future arenas are subsets of current arenas 
(for example, the digital ads arena grew 
out of the consumer internet arena). While 
they could collectively be defined from the 
demand side as competing in the “attention 
economy,” these arenas’ products are related 
replacements but not direct substitutes for 
one another. From the supply side, the sets 
of companies that participate in each of the 
three arenas are generally distinct. For this 
reason, we analyzed them as three separate 
arenas, while recognizing that overall 

The batteries arena has several 
subsegments, including batteries for 
EVs, battery energy storage systems, and 
batteries for consumer electronics. While 
each of these categories could have been 
analyzed as an independent arena, we 
looked to our supply-and-demand principles 
to help identify the reasonable level of 
granularity. On the supply side, all three 
subsegments have similar core technologies 
and participating players. And on the demand 
side, despite seemingly different end-use 
cases there is a similar need for stored 
energy. These characteristics are among the 
reasons we chose to define batteries as a 
single arena.

Spin-off arenas
Three arenas of today—consumer internet, software, and video and audio entertainment—have 
subsegments that may grow large enough and fast enough to become new arenas. The consumer 
internet arena of today could spin off a digital advertisement arena; the software arena of today 
could generate an AI software and services arena; and the video and audio entertainment arena of 
today could spawn a streaming video arena. From an S-curve perspective, a specific technological or 
business model step change helped separate these subsegments, now potential arenas of tomorrow, 
into their own new S-curves. For example, growth in the broader software industry is likely to slow 
as it approaches the tail end of its S-curve of adoption and innovation. AI, however, is disrupting the 
industry and leading to a new S-curve. This new S-curve is specific to AI software and services and 
could demonstrate its own explosive growth in the next few years, as is typical in the early stages of 
an S-curve.

AI software and services. Although some types of AI, such as machine learning, have been around 
for decades, the technology rose to public prominence in late 2022 with the release of OpenAI’s 
ChatGPT, a gen AI interface capable of producing remarkably humanlike responses to users’ 
prompts. The recent emergence of gen AI is the technological step change in this market that 
supports our definition of AI software and services as its own arena, making it a spin-off of software 
as an arena of today. Cloud services, a continuing arena, is also critical for AI software and services, 
because it enables most of the computational processing required by today’s AI models. And there 
are signs of momentum for adoption that indicate the beginnings of a new S-curve: in an April 2023 
McKinsey survey, nearly a third of respondents said their organizations were using gen AI in at least 
one business function, and 40 percent said their organizations would increase AI investments.35 In 
March 2024, two-thirds of the survey’s respondents reported that their organizations were using gen 
AI, doubling the level of adoption in less than one year.36

Players are escalating R&D investments in this arena as they attempt to differentiate their services 
through advanced capabilities. AI systems, such as GPT-4 by OpenAI and Gemini by Google, that 
compete in the “frontier” foundation models segment—that is, the biggest, most advanced models—
escalate investments in proprietary data and infrastructure to create industry-leading models. 
Players that compete in the fragmented specialized AI software segment (such as AI start-ups that 
have specific use cases) escalate investments by creating bespoke AI-enabled systems tailored 
to their use cases. This arena’s potential economic impact and the associated revenue could be 
significant as a result of a large market for both consumer as well as corporate use cases, such as 
consumer research and segmentation, software engineering, and operations.

Digital advertising. More people online, a rising middle class (just ten countries could add 900 
million people to the middle class by 2030), and more time spent on digital media (in the United 
States, from 40 percent in 2016 to 66 percent in 2026, according to forecasts)37 are continuing to 
increase the demand pool for digital advertising, which funds much of the internet through search, 
social, and media. Players are continuously experimenting with business models to attract users. 
For example, media players are trying out different ad-supported tiers, as well as the formats of 
advertisements, such as in-line ads in social media posts or ads displayed as part of a gen AI search 
query result.38 Technology in the industry also is moving quickly, with new players introducing new 
experiences such as short-form social videos or building capabilities to hyper-target customers 
and track the cost-effectiveness of advertisements, and increasing the use of gen AI for hyper-
personalization and to lower the cost of content creation.

Investments escalate as players attempt to sustain a leading edge in an environment with strong 
network effects. Players are locked in a battle for attention across platforms and must continuously 
invest to create the most engaging experience, biggest social network, or best media content to keep 
people—and the advertisers that want to reach them—on their platforms. Players must also invest

to capture new pockets of growth, especially in developing economies, where regional competitors 
can emerge to challenge global leaders. We expect digital ads to capture a growing share of global ad 
spending, from 65 percent in 2022 to between 80 and 90 percent by 2040.

Streaming video. The video and audio entertainment arena could be transformed because the 
streaming technology developed in the past 15 years is being adopted more rapidly, resulting in a new 
spin-off arena: streaming video. The uptake of streaming video is still in the steep part of its S-curve. 
In the past, investments for customer acquisition and content production escalated as competition 
intensified between players. However, companies now face pressure to increase profitability. As 
a consequence, investments will be made in partnerships and other collaborative models, such as 
content bundling. The two-way network effect in this arena will likely persist: more content attracts 
viewers, and more viewers give platforms more leverage to license content or revenues to produce 
their own.

The market for streaming video may also be buoyed by demand from increasing high-speed internet 
access in developing economies as more households around the world gain the ability to stream 
video online. This larger customer base would also increase the potential revenues earned from 
advertising on these platforms.

Emergent arenas
The remaining 11 potential arenas of tomorrow, the emergent arenas, are generally novel relative to 
existing industries. In other words, they are not clear subsegments, though some of their enabling 
technologies may be similar to those that enable other industries or arenas. These potential arenas 
vary in degree of maturity, a natural consequence of using 2022 as the starting point of our analysis. 
Some of these potential arenas, such as video games, have existed for decades, while others, such 
as drugs for obesity and related conditions, are in very early stages of formation. For all of them, 
however, there is high growth and high dynamism potential because these arenas are in the early to 
middle phases of their S-curves.

Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The development of technology for vehicle autonomy 
(integration of computer vision, real-time machine learning, and large-scale data engineering, such 
as high-resolution mapping) is the step change in this arena, where R&D investments escalate 
primarily to overcome technological obstacles that affect the cars’ safety and reliability. Despite the 
increased prevalence of vehicles for hire that don’t require a human driver, a recent decline in SAV 
investment suggests that commercialization may go more slowly than forecast. The large market 
for SAVs could depend on regulation, technological progress, financial feasibility, and consumer 
adoption of the vehicles.39 We estimate that SAVs could capture 25 to 51 percent of the shared 
mobility industry’s revenues by 2040.

Space. The commercial sector of the space arena has shown robust growth and accelerating market 
activity in the past decade, with recent players, such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic, 
entering the fray. Government interest has also evolved: the number of government space agencies 
around the world has grown from 40 in 2000 to more than 75 today.40 This arena experiences 
frequent technological step changes, especially in the form of commercially viable spacecraft and 
new satellite systems, like SpaceX’s Starlink system. Innovations in launch mechanisms, such as 
reusable boosters, are also under way.

Escalation in R&D has occurred in both the public and private sectors. Major players continue to 
double down on investments for new product launches. Private-sector spending in space is reaching 
all-time highs, with more than $70 billion invested in 2021 and 2022 combined.41

Growth in the space arena may be driven by state-sponsored investments in the civil and defense 
segments; consumer needs for space capabilities, such as communications and navigation; and 
commercial infrastructure and support operations required to meet these state-sponsored and 
consumer demands.

Cybersecurity. In 2020, the global direct financial damage from cybercrime was estimated at about 
$950 billion, almost twice the $520 billion recorded in 2018. When considering direct, indirect, and 
upstream systemic costs, the overall economic impact of cybercrime in 2020 was estimated to reach 
approximately $4 trillion to $6 trillion, or more than 4 percent of global GDP and more than four times 
the direct costs.42 As adversarial parties keep improving their capabilities, selling ransomware-
as-a-service, and creating marketplaces for hacking tools and data, players in this arena need 
to continuously improve their offerings to protect computer systems from unauthorized access 
by adversaries. The cybersecurity technological step change is the data protection and network 
security that complements other fast-growing technologies with new vulnerabilities. 

As a result, R&D investments escalate for the development of more effective products and services. 
This often includes investing in proprietary data sets and processing power, which are frequently 
needed for AI use cases. Innovation in the industry has been expanding, too, with the number of 
patents growing at rates of 10 to 25 percent from 2017 to 2021. As attacks continue to increase and 
the digital landscape grows and changes, cybersecurity spending is expected to represent a larger 
share of global IT spending, from 6 percent in 2022 to between 7 and 14 percent by 2040.

Batteries. The global energy transition is fueling demand for batteries, mainly due to the continued 
growth of EVs, battery energy storage systems, and consumer electronics. Manufacturers of 
batteries have made technological step changes related to energy density, charging speed, longer 
life cycles, and manufacturing sustainability. 

R&D is likely to escalate as manufacturers innovate on battery technologies, such as enriching the 
anode with silicon compounds. Manufacturers also are innovating in new designs such as solid-
state and new chemistries such as lithium-sulfur and vanadium redox, which could become direct 
substitutes for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries in specific applications. Capital expenditures 
could escalate as players try to capture the benefits of manufacturing at scale, as seen in the rise of 
gigafactories. As a result, barriers to entry could rise for new entrants, improving the margins of large 
incumbents.

Video games. The rise of mobile and cloud gaming, which allow games to be delivered faster through 
new platforms, served as a technology step change in this arena.43 This coincides with a business 
model step change, with free-to-play games like Fortnite aiming for wider distribution and to 
generate revenue through in-game purchases. R&D investments, especially in game development, 
have escalated in this arena. For example, several high-profile AAA games are released each year.44 
These games have budgets of at least $200 million, more than the average production budget of the 
150 most expensive movies from 2016 to 2023, $180 million. 

The surge in mobile gaming and the success of the free-to-play in-game-purchase business model 
on various platforms drive this large and growing market. Growing consumer spending on games, 
as well as higher advertising revenue and console sales, are expected to increase revenues despite 
recent setbacks in certain markets, such as below-expectations revenue growth and consumer 
spending that returned to prepandemic levels. 

Robotics. Advancements in the autonomous-robot segment represent a major technological reset 
by helping to improve the mobility and dexterity of the machines and increase the range of tasks they 
can perform easily. One way to understand this arena is through robot types, from single-purpose 
robots typically used in industrial or manufacturing environments to general-purpose robots, 
which are more recent and can execute a variety of tasks with limited human intervention. Boston

Dynamics, Tesla, Figure, Google, and Sanctuary are among the players trying to develop general-
purpose robots to take on tasks currently performed by humans. 

R&D investments may escalate, especially in the subsectors of general-purpose robots and 
specialized robots for specific use cases, such as cooking or packing boxes. Players are intensifying 
an already heavy R&D focus on deep technology as they vie for share. Acquisitions and investments 
in robotics companies are also escalating. The robotics arena received a growing influx of capital, 
with venture capital investment increasing from about $4.6 billion in 2018 to about $13 billion in 2022. 

Industrial and consumer biotechnology. The technology step change in this arena is attributable 
to breakthrough biological innovations, such as the decline in the cost of reading genetic codes and 
the improvement in the capability to edit genes using CRISPR technology. As a result, application 
of this technology may accelerate in four areas: agricultural biotechnology (such as bioengineered 
crops), alternative proteins (such as cell-based meats), consumer products and services (such as 
personalized wellness products), and biomaterials and biochemicals (such as bioplastics). 

R&D and capital expenditures account for the majority of the escalatory investments for product 
development, commercialization, and manufacturing needs. The large and growing market in 
the industrial and commercial biotechnology arena may be driven by several factors, including 
advancements in technology facilitating R&D, increasing consumer demand, the commercialization 
of new products and services, and regulatory and consumer commitments to sustainability.

Modular construction. These are builders in the housing market that produce standardized, 
prefabricated modules made at an off-site factory and then assembled into buildings. This method 
can improve construction productivity amid lagging labor productivity growth in the gigantic 
$13 trillion global construction industry. Improving construction productivity is urgent to address  
an ongoing global housing shortage and affordability crisis, as well as a critical skilled labor gap in  
the construction industry.

The modular, prefabricated process that enables the parallelization of construction phases is the 
business model reset in this arena and could greatly improve construction productivity. While some 
modular construction is widespread in a few high labor-cost countries like Japan, the Nordics, and 
Singapore, global penetration is still relatively low.

However, there are signs that broader adoption—the rising part of the S-curve—could be near. There 
is increasing investment and research into processes and digital tools that can help players solve the 
complex value chain coordination challenges of modular construction. And growth in modular has  
the potential for a flywheel effect. As more buildings are built using modular techniques, the supply  
of modular increases, which in turn makes it more likely that other developers could choose modular 
as well. 

Nuclear fission power plants. Today, nuclear fission reactors are the second-largest source of 
electricity generated with low emissions of greenhouse gases, after hydropower. In this arena, we 
look at players that build nuclear power generation facilities. The next generation of small modular 
reactors is an example of a technological step change because the reactors are designed to be both 
safer than traditional large-scale reactors and cheaper to build by using prefabricated components 
and standardized designs. As more countries build nuclear power plants and the global market 
grows, learning curve efficiencies could push down this capital expenditure for both large-scale 
reactors and SMRs. 

R&D investments could escalate in the race to reduce building costs and develop new reactor 
technologies, construction methods, and coolant types. Global venture investment funders seem 
optimistic about this arena despite the high capital costs and the long time horizon before returns 
are realized. Funding rose from about $60 million in 2018 to about $390 million in 2022. To reach

emissions-reduction targets, countries would likely need to rely on nuclear power to complement 
intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. China, Russia, South Korea, and other 
countries plan to significantly scale up nuclear power production. At the COP28 climate conference 
in 2023, 25 countries pledged to triple their nuclear energy capacity by 2050 to reduce emissions. 

Future air mobility. Innovations in materials, propulsion, batteries, and autonomous technology 
for passenger electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) and delivery drones are the 
technological step changes in this arena. R&D investments in these components could continue 
to increase as air mobility technologies begin to reach commercialization. The need for “vertiport” 
boarding and landing facilities, as well as delivery distribution centers, means capital expenditures may 
also increase. While many of these nascent technologies are yet to be commercially available, there are 
early signs of future growth: disclosed annual funding for this arena grew from less than $600 million 
in 2017 to $5 billion in 2023 as companies progressed on their regulatory and certification journeys 
and aimed to tap the large addressable markets for new modes of transportation. 

Drugs for obesity and related conditions. A report by the World Obesity Atlas estimates that 
obesity prevalence could rise from 14 percent in 2020 to 24 percent by 2035, based on current 
trajectories, with an attributable economic impact of $2.0 trillion in 2020 and $4.3 trillion in 2035.45 
The technology step change in this arena was the introduction of GLP-1 agonists, a revolutionary 
class of drugs that were initially approved to treat diabetes and, more recently, obesity as well.

An escalatory dynamic is evident in the R&D race, as major players develop their own GLP-1 weight-
loss therapies. With generics on the horizon, players are incentivized to further invest in R&D for more 
efficacious drugs with fewer adverse effects or more convenient drug administration like an oral solid 
pill, rather than the current injectables. 

Other candidate arenas
In determining potential future arenas, we considered new industries that could eventually become 
arenas but are less likely than some other industries to achieve the high growth and high dynamism 
of our arenas of tomorrow. We discuss them briefly below, with an emphasis on swing factors that 
could make them arenas.46 We consider two other groups of industries: the ceasing arenas—arenas 
of today that are unlikely to persist as arenas of tomorrow—and the almost emergent arenas, which 
have uncertain growth or dynamism prospects. 

Ceasing arenas
Five arenas of today—biopharmaceuticals, consumer electronics, information-enabled business 
services, industrial electronics, and payments—are likely to cease to be arenas. This does not mean 
these industries will not see high growth or high dynamism; they remain critical to today’s economy. 
However, growth or dynamism may not be at the same scale as in the past 15 years. These arenas 
are hitting the plateauing phase of their S-curves. Many are likely to continue to benefit from a 
mega-force like payments taking advantage of digitization opportunities in emerging markets, or 
biopharmaceuticals serving a more prosperous world. However, the growth of these current arenas is 
likely to be more stable than explosive.

Biopharmaceuticals. The distinction between biopharmaceuticals and their traditional 
pharmaceutical counterparts is becoming irrelevant. As it is, players are already incorporating both 
into their product lines as effective drugs for targeted treatments, combination therapies, or both. As 
a result, biopharmaceuticals, which have been disruptive in the past, are already mainstream. There is 
also a weak case for vulnerability or obsolescence of the traditional pharmaceuticals industry.

Both biopharmaceuticals and traditional pharmaceuticals could see breakthroughs that spur the high 
growth and dynamism required of an arena beyond those achieved in the treatment of obesity and 
related conditions (already a potential future arena). These advancements could occur in oncology 
research, neuroscience, immunology, or gene therapy, among other fields.

Consumer electronics. Established players, such as Apple and Samsung, are likely to drive growth 
in this industry over the next few years as demand remains robust. However, growth may not be of 
the same magnitude as before. Some estimates indicate that the consumer electronics industry 
could grow at a 3 percent rate from 2024 to 2028, a lower pace than the 7 percent observed in this 
arena from 2005 to 2020.47 This slower growth could result from plateauing of smartphone adoption 
globally. It is also possible that market leaders could maintain intensifying and stable market share 
competition over the next few years, making the dynamism prospects of this arena uncertain.

Information-enabled business services. Most of the growth from knowledge and business process 
outsourcing as a result of globalization and digitization has likely already been captured, and greater 
stability is expected as large incumbents buttress their market positions.

Industrial electronics. This arena has already captured large pockets of growth, including in China. 
While growth may reach about 6 percent through 2030, it most likely will not be at the same pace as 
before, a slowdown that could be similar to the likely gradual plateauing of the consumer electronics 
arena.48

Payments. For established payment use cases, such as high-frequency and small-ticket 
transactions, the expansion of payments brought about by digitization was mostly captured in the 
past decade. That gave current players a strong hold on market shares but will likely result in this 
arena’s reduced growth or dynamism prospects compared with the past two decades. However, 
opportunity for some growth remains. Players could enter the market and innovate solutions for 
low-frequency but large-size transactions, such as tuition and business services like home repair. 
Regional players could emerge in developing markets, which could lead to new growth.

Almost-emergent arenas 
These candidate arenas were not analyzed as deeply as our 18 arenas of tomorrow described 
above. Some of these potential arenas, such as Web3, were not included primarily because of high 
uncertainty about their growth or dynamism prospects. Others have a more certain rising trajectory 
but a lower probability of evolving into arenas compared with the 18 we analyzed. Nonetheless, 
we have chosen to discuss them below because each has exciting potential and we recognize the 
possibility that these industries could still become arenas—we want to leave plenty of room for the 
eventuality that things could turn out differently from expectations. These candidate arenas are as 
follows, ordered alphabetically: 

Clean hydrogen. This industry consists of companies that provide energy through low-carbon 
hydrogen, including from natural gas, known as blue hydrogen, as well as renewable hydrogen  
from electrolysis powered by renewables, known as green hydrogen. The current use cases, mostly 
for industrial processes like oil refining, required approximately 90 million tons of hydrogen in 
2022.49 The share of clean hydrogen in current hydrogen consumption is negligible, at less than 
one million tons.

The new industry of producing low-emission hydrogen is already encountering regulatory tailwinds. 
For example, in 2023, the EU Hydrogen Bank, backed by a $3.3 billion investment from the EU 
Innovation Fund, held its first EU-wide auction for renewable hydrogen producers that wished to 
receive support. The auction attracted 132 bids from 17 countries.50 In February 2024, Germany 
allocated €3.5 billion in subsidies to support green hydrogen exporters through H2Global.51 The 
US Department of Energy has announced a $7 billion investment to launch seven regional clean 
hydrogen hubs.52

Existing demand for industrial use cases is expected to be stable, increasing from about 86 metric 
tons in 2020 to 111 metric tons in 2040, but new pockets of demand will likely come from new 
industrial use cases such as green steel or grid-level storage. However, there is considerable 
uncertainty about the uptake of hydrogen in industrial processes or emerging use cases. This 
uncertainty stems from factors including an evolving regulatory climate, the development of enabling 
technology and specialized infrastructure, competition dynamics with other decarbonization 
technologies, and potential adoption barriers like distribution and delivery costs.

Lower-carbon materials. This industry consists of manufacturers of low-carbon materials, of which 
steel, cement, and aluminum are most relevant for decarbonization (low-carbon bioplastics are 
discussed in the industrial and consumer biotechnology compendium entry). These three materials 
have varying starting points and face their own challenges as decarbonization continues. The 
industry could undergo a big shift enabled by potential technological breakthroughs to decarbonize 
the manufacturing process achieved by the use of electrification, circularity, carbon capture 
storage, or low-emission fuels such as biomass. Today, about $6 billion of revenues are generated 
from the sale of lower-carbon (“green”) materials. This figure could grow to hundreds of billions by 
2040. Green steel will likely be the largest component of this growth, contributing about half of the 
revenues. Projections are highly sensitive to future price fluctuations in the materials industry.

The lower-carbon materials industry has the potential for high dynamism. The acceleration of steel 
decarbonization may entail a reconfiguration of the value chain as energy-intensive production 
steps such as direct iron reduction locate closer to sources of clean energy, a requirement for the 
decarbonization process. While this would imply large investments, it also opens up opportunities as 
more geographies become attractive as locations for new plants. The massive energy requirements 
of green steel manufacturing may require new capacity in regions with lower energy costs like Brazil, 
the Middle East and North Africa, and countries like Spain.53 Many, if not all, incumbent steel players 
have decarbonization projects under development or in implementation. Meanwhile, new players like 
H2 Green Steel have started making moves aimed at building a large-scale green steel plant that 
would start production as early as March 2026.54

However, green steel’s growth is uncertain for two reasons. First, global demand for steel may 
be reduced by an unevenly distributed slowdown across regions and industries over the next 
few years. The shifts that could cause this uncertainty include the “normalization” of demand in 
China, which may be partially offset by growth in Southeast Asia and India, and the slowdown in 
construction demand, which may be offset by growth in energy and transportation.55 Second, there 
is uncertainty about how rapidly green steel could replace traditional steel. This is mostly due to the 
competitiveness of green steel manufacturing costs compared with traditional steel. The cost could 
be affected by several factors, including regulatory support, capital investments, manufacturing 
technology advancements, raw energy costs, and value chain reconfigurations. Despite this 
industry’s potential high dynamism and large shifts, the growth uncertainty diminishes the likelihood 
that low-carbon materials could reach arena status.

Products and services for older adults. Companies in these industries offer services to meet the 
needs of adults aged 65 and older. By 2050, there could be 1.6 billion people in this demographic. 
In 2022, there were, on average, seven working people for every person over 65 (also known as  
the old-age dependency ratio). By 2040, that ratio could shrink to four to one, creating a shortage 
of caregivers. 

Today, an estimated $13 trillion is being spent on and by older people, with housing, health, and 
wellness the biggest drivers. Traditional players participate in select parts of elder care services, 
including nursing homes that provide housing and meet care needs, and financial institutions that 
provide retirement and pension management and other services. Only a few of the players we

considered provide holistic, seamless services. At the same time, older adults’ needs like health, 
connection, autonomy, and security are not always fully met in this rapidly changing environment.

Some early platform plays are surfacing today: JD.com is investing in a care ecosystem for 
older people through partnerships, telehealth product launches, and healthcare management 
products. Clariane Group, a nursing care provider, acquired 32 companies in 2019 and 2020 to 
create a digital ecosystem for home care professionals and care facility residents.56 A truly digital 
and comprehensive ecosystem by 2040 would require technological step changes, such as the 
automation of caregiving, and coordinated innovation among tech players, property developers, 
healthcare providers, and financial services players. Sufficient early signs of these breakthroughs 
and innovations have yet to be observed at a level that could ignite an arena.

Aside from these technological uncertainties, it is also likely that the industry will remain fragmented 
if global or even national plays are discouraged by limited economies of scale, market regulations, 
cultural differences, and the way services are delivered. For these reasons, even though this industry 
is likely to see major growth as populations age, there may be limited dynamism as players remain 
small and local, making products and services for older adults less likely to be an arena of tomorrow. 

Nuclear fusion. This industry consists of companies that build plants able to generate electricity 
through nuclear fusion. More than 130 experimental fusion devices are operating, under  
construction, or planned around the world today.57 While the technology is still in the experimental  
phase, fusion has the potential to become the world’s zero-emissions power source, promising  
cheap and abundant clean energy that could transform the world.

Yet even though the technology is promising, uncertainty about the rate of technological progression 
is the primary swing factor determining whether nuclear fusion could become an arena. It is unlikely 
that a commercially scalable and sizable industry could be formed by 2040, even in the best-case 
scenario of a major scientific breakthrough as early as 2030. Several technical challenges must 
be overcome before a fusion reactor can become commercially viable: magnet performance, 
survivability of the first wall, plasma stability in confinement concepts other than tokamaks, and 
reliable heating systems.58 Massive R&D investments, supply chain advancements, talent sourcing, 
and partnerships to develop regulation would all be needed and would take a long time to scale up. 
For these reasons, nuclear fusion has a relatively low probability of sufficient growth to become an 
arena by 2040.

Renewables generation equipment and infrastructure. These are companies that manufacture 
equipment for renewable energy generation (wind and solar), storage for renewable energy, and 
transmission and distribution infrastructure. The potential growth in this industry is driven by the 
continued push for decarbonization. Many governments have committed to net-zero targets, and 
several technological advancements in renewable generation in the past decade drove production 
and cost efficiencies. Solar and wind power have both become cost competitive with fossil-
fuel-based power sources in the past decade.59 Global investment in renewable energy rose to 
$358 billion in the first half of 2023, an all-time high for a six-month period.

This industry is likely to see higher growth in the earlier phase of our time horizon, until 2030, 
but more modest growth from 2030 to 2040. Three compounding swing factors may change 
this estimate. The first is the pace of energy consumption growth, which could be influenced by 
population growth, industrial needs, and EV adoption, among other factors. Second is the ability of 
the renewables sector to capture a material share of this growth, which would require simultaneous 
investments in steps from generation to distribution. Third, uncertainty about the pace of technology 
advances and affordability translates to uncertainty about the total investment and timing of the peak 
expenditure in this sector.

While renewables generation is likely to take an increasing share of global electricity production, the 
industry’s growth trajectory to 2040 is uncertain, especially if peak expenditure occurs before then 
and growth from new installs slows. The industry could also see low dynamism as high barriers to 
entry favor incumbents. These factors make renewables generation equipment and infrastructure an 
almost emergent arena with a promising trajectory but also relatively lower likelihood of becoming an 
arena of tomorrow.

Sustainable fuels. This industry consists of companies that use sources other than fossils to make 
liquid fuels for transportation, primarily for cars, trucks, aviation, and marine. Over their lifetimes—
that is, from when they are produced to when they are burned in vehicles—sustainable fuels typically 
emit fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels.

There are three kinds of sustainable fuel. First are conventional biofuels, made from raw materials 
that are edible, such as sugars and starches derived from corn or sugarcane, or from oils derived 
from sunflower or rapeseed. These mostly alcohol- and ester-based fuels need to be blended with 
traditional fossil fuels to be used in a typical internal combustion engine, which is why they are called 
“blend-in” fuels. Second are advanced biofuels made from raw materials that are not used for food, 
including agricultural residue, dedicated crops, and waste. These fuels, called “drop-in” fuels, are 
chemically similar to gasoline and can be used without blending with traditional fossil fuels. The third 
kind is e-fuels, made by breaking down water into hydrogen and oxygen, typically by combining the 
hydrogen with carbon.

There is potential for sustainable fuels to grow to arena status by 2040 if the industry captures a 
large enough share of the fuels market. However, great uncertainty surrounds the industry’s growth 
prospects because of the challenges that would need to be overcome to reach scale, such as 
customers’ willingness to pay a green premium for sustainable fuels, and how much the trajectory 
of electrified mobility will affect global fuel demand. Further, degrees of fragmentation vary among 
players in the three segments of sustainable fuels. For example, drop-in fuels are likely to have a few 
large producers, whereas the supplier base for blend-in fuels and e-fuels is highly fragmented. These 
uncertainties make it hard to assert that sustainable fuels are a likely arena of tomorrow, though they 
have that potential.

Virtual reality and augmented reality (VR and AR). This industry consists of players that 
manufacture the hardware required for VR and AR, and players that provide the software operated 
on this hardware. VR and AR companies enable customers to immerse themselves in virtual worlds 
where users are “in” the experience rather than merely observing it. The VR and AR industry had 
estimated revenues of $22 billion in 2022 from hardware and software sales.60 About $30 billion in 
venture capital flows went to VR and AR from 2020 to 2023. 

VR and AR can be applied for both consumer and commercial use cases. For consumers, the 
metaverse is an example of the extended application of VR and AR (although the metaverse can also 
be accessed through conventional interfaces, such as phones and laptops). Corporate use cases 
range from healthcare applications, such as 3D body mapping, to retail, such as trying on clothing 
and experimenting with furniture placement in a room, to education and training, such as VR-assisted 
instruction for machinery-intensive jobs. 

While the potential technological step changes in this industry are clear in both the innovative 
hardware and the accompanying software that enable the VR and AR experience, it is uncertain 
whether the escalatory dynamic in investments and addressable market are sufficient to develop the 
growth and dynamism features required of an arena by 2040. Two mutually reinforcing swing factors 
may determine the future of this industry. First, there will likely need to be substantial step changes 
in the technology, particularly in lighter-weight headsets that do not have to be tethered for power 
and do not cause nausea in a substantial set of users. Second, the industry would require widespread

adoption of the technology and software platforms for new use cases. If the technology performs well 
enough to encourage adoption, that could spur more investments to improve the technology. If these 
two factors create a virtuous cycle, the VR and AR industry could be an arena by 2040.

Web3, including decentralized finance. Web3 is the idea of a new, decentralized internet built 
on blockchains, which are distributed ledgers controlled communally by participants. Web3 has 
the potential to change how information is managed, how the internet is monetized, and even how 
web-based corporations function. Most of the potential growth could come from financial use cases 
related to tokenization, trading, payments, decentralized finance, and custody. However, some areas 
of Web3 have seen downturns as others continue to soar. For example, the crypto market’s market 
capitalization fell more than 50 percent in 2022, while there was a 68 percent increase in nonfungible 
token sales in the same year.61 Technology adoption also seems to have advanced: as of 2023, there 
were thousands of decentralized applications running, compared with about 1,000 in 2018.62

This is a nascent industry that is shifting rapidly and faces several obstacles, mainly related to the 
need for clarity in regulations regarding asset classification, tax reporting, and know your customer 
(KYC) standards. However, there has already been significant regulatory activity. For instance, the 
US Congress proposed more than 50 crypto regulations in 2022.63 Technical obstacles, including 
privacy concerns, have arisen because blockchains are public by design, which limits potential 
use cases. Other obstacles include the risk of fraud, high transaction costs, and services that are 
sensitive to failure.64

Web3 is still in its infancy and could transform the way we execute transactions, run applications, and 
own assets. However, there are major uncertainties on the path toward adoption that could influence 
the development of the ecosystem and which players could be active in it. As a result of this great 
uncertainty, it is hard to estimate whether Web3 would display the revenue growth and competitive 
dynamism to qualify as an arena of 2040.

Geopolitical disruption, the  
development of AI, and the pace 
of the green transition could 
be critical swing factors.

The significance of potential future arenas
In chapters 1 and 2 we demonstrated that the 12 arenas of today are not only centers of value creation 
but also industries that materially change the way we live. Our 18 arenas of tomorrow could be even 
more transformative, as they could shape how we consume and process data, approach health and 
wellness, and interact and communicate with one another. Innovations in areas such as robotics, 
mobility, AI, and clean energy may play a growing part in expanding the choices available to us in our 
daily lives. 

We may soon be able to take an eVTOL from our local vertiport instead of ordering an Uber. We may 
have AI virtual assistants to help us finish writing emails or plan our vacations. We may have the 
option to commute to work in a shared ride in an autonomous shuttle instead of driving our own car. 
Homeowners may be able to store renewable electricity in their EV batteries and use those batteries 
to buy electricity when prices are low and to sell it back to the grid when prices are high. A wide 
variety of robots may come to assist us with physical labor, speeding up task times in agriculture  
or construction.

But also, looking back to 2005, we recognize cause for humility. No one could have predicted all of 
the ways in which the arenas of today have evolved. Therefore, we also highlight some critical swing 
factors that go beyond uncertainties in the modeling and are more fundamental to the evolution of 
the arenas of tomorrow in technology, investment patterns, and sources of demand. Many of these 
factors are specific to individual arenas and are described in the compendium at the end of this 
report, but looking across arenas, we see the following three themes:65

Developments in geopolitics: Geopolitical events affect many arenas. Swing factors include the 
possibility that technology stacks could diverge across regions, with different groups of countries 
pursuing technologies in parallel, such as in AI if government actions create multiple geographically 
distinct ecosystems. And technology players could be affected by geopolitical changes that create 
turbulence in trade flows and markets. It also remains to be seen whether the internet could become 
more regional, and the impact that could have on cybersecurity, cloud services, and other industries. 

While geopolitical developments could affect the growth of many arenas, they will have an even 
greater impact on dynamism by defining who the players are and where they are allowed to play. 
Geopolitical splintering and disruption would be particularly relevant to the following arenas: 
cybersecurity, robotics, AI, cloud services, space, EVs, batteries, semiconductors, e-commerce, and 
digital advertisements.

Development and adoption of AI technology: AI software and services is an arena, and the evolution 
of artificial intelligence, especially gen AI, could fundamentally change the shape of several other 
arenas over the coming decades. New capabilities enabled by gen AI could lower the cost of 
creative content used in digital ads, create storylines for immersive video games, give robots lifelike 
personalities, or change the way consumers find products and services on search platforms. But 
much will depend on the pace of AI adoption, how quickly use cases come online, and the value of the 
productivity gains from using the technology. 

In addition, the adoption of automation could be sharply accelerated. Without gen AI, automation 
could take over tasks accounting for 22 percent of the hours worked in the US economy by 2030, 
according to our estimates. With gen AI, that share could jump to 30 percent.66 The trajectory of AI 
development could affect all 18 arenas but is especially relevant to video games, streaming video, 
digital ads, cloud services, cybersecurity, e-commerce, semiconductors, robotics, industrial and 
consumer biotechnology, and SAVs. The technology still faces technological hurdles before full 
deployment, including gen AI’s factual accuracy and safety concerns over privacy and misuse.

Pace of the green transition: Global efforts to alter the course of climate change by reducing CO2 
emissions67 could drive demand in many of the 18 potential arenas of tomorrow (and determine 
whether as many as five of the eight almost emergent arenas become arenas). Often, their potential 
revenue size depends substantially on how much of a priority governments, consumers, and 
businesses place on carbon emissions reductions and how much they’re willing to pay to abate them 
in cost, time, or convenience. For example, if countries remain committed to clean energy targets, 
they will likely require some nuclear fission power production to balance dips in solar and wind 
generation. If emission reductions become a lower political priority, countries could have a much 
broader range of options to meet their energy needs. The robustness of decarbonization targets 
and the commitments people and governments make to achieve them will likely have a major impact 
on the future market size of EVs, batteries, nuclear fission power plants, industrial and consumer 
biotechnology, and modular construction.

As the direction of these swing factors becomes clear, so too will the trajectory of our growth and 
dynamism scenarios. Our research provides an initial view of where to expect the most growth and 
dynamism and how to update that view as the future takes shape. 

Analyzing the trajectories of the potential 18 arenas of tomorrow surfaces critical questions, from the 
ethics underpinning data and privacy to imperatives for businesses to be inclusive and sustainable. 
While arenas’ precise trajectories are difficult to predict, economic and social disruptions are natural 
consequences as these industries form, grow, and impact the world. Recognizing how and when 
arenas originate, understanding how they evolve, and anticipating the way they impact the world can 
offer a unique view of the arc of society’s progress.

To give more insight into the economics of arenas, we present a compendium of the 18 future arenas 
and discuss in detail how high growth and high dynamism might play out in each. These descriptions 
should not be read as comprehensive accounts. Instead, they explain a rationale for a range of 
scenarios for growth and dynamism over the coming decades and describe some swing factors that 
could alter the outcomes.

1. E-commerce

The e-commerce industry consists of companies that sell goods to consumers through digital 
channels. This industry is already well established, its rise fueled by the spread of broadband 
internet access, increasing ways to access the internet (especially smartphones), and innovations in 
product delivery, including on-demand warehousing, last-mile delivery, increased automation, and 
crowdsourced delivery methods.68

E-commerce is one of today’s arenas, as we describe in chapter 1, and there are many reasons to 
believe that it could be one of tomorrow’s, too. In 2022, the retail e-commerce segment accounted 
for 20 percent of a $17 trillion overall global retail market, leaving plenty of room for further expansion 
in both geography and product categories. Online markets in China, Latin America, and other 
developing economies are likely to continue to grow as digitization increases. And e-commerce is 
expected to continue to expand into new major product categories, such as personal care and food. 
Social commerce, or making purchases on social media apps, is also on the rise.69

Growth
We define e-commerce as completing purchases on computers and mobile devices, including selling 
and buying items that consumers pick up at brick-and-mortar stores. This definition encompasses 
revenue from manufacturers with direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels, platform providers such as 
Amazon that have marketplaces for third-party retailers, third-party retailers (known as merchants) 
when they sell on platforms such as Amazon, and traditional retailers with online channels. This 
excludes several industry-adjacent markets, including peer-to-peer or consumer-to-consumer (C2C) 
sales, such as those available on Facebook Marketplace, and ride-hailing and streaming services. 

Our overall sizing of the industry has two main segments: retail e-commerce and food e-commerce 
(shipping costs excluded). The retail e-commerce segment includes categories of consumer goods 
such as general merchandise, apparel, and appliances.70 Together, the revenues of the two segments 
reached roughly $4 trillion in 2022. That could grow to between $14 trillion and $20 trillion by 2040, a 
CAGR of 7 to 9 percent.71

The retail e-commerce segment currently accounts for one-fifth of global retail revenues (both online 
and offline), and that share could reach 27 to 38 percent by 2040. In our estimates, revenues could grow 
from $3.4 trillion in 2022 to $11 trillion by 2040 in the lower range of scenarios and to $16 trillion in the 
higher range of scenarios. Meanwhile, the food e-commerce segment brings in $630 billion in revenues 
today, or 4 percent of global retail revenues. That could grow to $3 trillion by 2040 in the lower range of 
scenarios and to $4 trillion in the higher range of scenarios, or 7 to 9 percent of global retail revenues. 

Retail e-commerce could come to represent a larger overall share of total retail sales in developing 
economies, where it is now less prevalent than in developed economies. For example, in 2022, its 
share of retail sales was just 12 percent in Latin America, 4 percent in the Middle East, and 2 percent 
in Africa. The lower range of scenarios assumes that retail e-commerce could account for 26 percent 
of retail revenues in Latin America by 2040, 15 percent in the Middle East, and 10 percent in Africa. 
In the higher range of scenarios, Latin America’s share increases to 29 percent, the Middle East’s to 
20 percent, and Africa’s to 15 percent.

E-commerce in those markets could grow with the expansion of the middle class, increased access 
to broadband, and the development of infrastructure and services, such as last-mile delivery, 
that enable sales. For example, smartphone penetration in India grew from 26 percent in 2018 
to 36 percent in 2022 and is expected to reach 56 percent by 2027. In sub-Saharan Africa, the

smartphone penetration rate increased from 19 percent in 2018 to 36 percent in 2022 and is 
expected to hit 48 percent by 2027. This growth added 400 million smartphone users in these two 
regions from 2018 to 2022 and could account for an additional 550 million users globally by 2027. 
Smartphone penetration was much higher in developed economies such as North America, reaching 
86 percent in 2023. Some connectivity growth is likely to come from broadband: from 2022 to 2040, 
penetration in India could rise from 10 percent to 21 percent, and from 5 to 9 percent in sub-Saharan 
Africa.72 These trends suggest potential for improving connectivity in developing regions.

Developed markets could see more e-commerce, too. In North America, retail e-commerce held a 
25 percent share of total retail spending in 2022. The Asia–Pacific region’s share was 22 percent, and 
Europe’s was 16 percent. The lower range of scenarios estimates that retail e-commerce would increase 
to a 30 percent share in North America, to 28 percent in the Asia–Pacific region, and to 27 percent in 
Europe by 2040. The latter two markets lag behind North American penetration rates by six and eight 
years, respectively. In the higher range of scenarios, retail e-commerce penetration could grow to 
50 percent in North America by 2040, to 40 percent in Asia–Pacific, and to 36 percent in Europe. 

Most of the growth in developed markets would result from e-commerce’s expansion into new 
categories. Consumers around the world are already accessing twice as many industries online as 
they did before the COVID-19 pandemic, and there are at least 25 million “high potential” customers in 
the United States and Europe who tried e-commerce in new categories during the pandemic but have 
not fully adopted it.73 The food segment had the fastest growth from 2017 to 2022, when spending 
increased 34 percent a year. In some estimates, the segment’s share of all e-commerce could grow 
from 16 percent in 2022 to about 20 percent in 2040.74 More emotional goods such as apparel, 
home goods, skincare, jewelry, premium tea, and arts and crafts are also sold online through social 
commerce and the storytelling this approach enables (see below). In the long run, that could be a 
significant driver of growth for the industry, even in developed markets. The lower range of scenarios 
assumes limited category expansion, while the higher range assumes significant expansion.

The Asia–Pacific region has a mix of developing and developed economies with diverse e-commerce 
dynamics. The penetration rate of online shopping in developed economies varied. In 2023, it was 
30 percent in South Korea and 15 percent in Japan.75 It also varied in developing economies, at 36 
percent in China and 32 percent in Indonesia. The rate was just 8 percent in India in 2023, but that 
was double the 4 percent rate in 2018, suggesting momentum. 

New e-commerce formats are also driving growth. Social commerce platforms use online media to 
boost user and influencer interaction, promoting online sales of products and services by merging 
social content with shopping to enhance informed purchasing. In 2023, the top 35 leading social 
sellers recorded more than $24 billion (170 billion reminbi) in sales in China via live sessions across 
platforms. The sales from all live sessions represented more than 30 percent of total e-commerce 
sales in China that year.76

Discount and low-price platforms are also showing success. Online marketplaces such as Pinduoduo 
are growing fast in China through their value commerce platforms that offer affordable pricing and a 
game-like shopping experience. This platform model also gained popularity globally as companies 
such as Temu and SHEIN leveraged their strong supply chains in China, quickly scaling in the United 
States and Europe. 

Additionally, conversational commerce, which enables sales through messaging platforms such as 
WhatsApp, is increasingly becoming integral to the shopping experience. The rise of generative AI  
(gen AI), the widespread use of chat apps, and the surge in online shopping are propelling conversational 
commerce, potentially boosting its market size to $41 billion by 2030. And quick commerce promises 
delivery to customers in hours or even minutes, a model that is particularly suited to relatively small  
and frequent purchases of merchandise such as convenience store items and groceries.77

Dynamism
In 2023, the three largest e-commerce platform providers, Amazon, Alibaba, and JD.com, accounted 
for 15 percent of the revenue share of all companies that sell online, including manufacturers with 
DTC channels, platform providers, and traditional retailers with an online channel.78 However, the 
retail value of the merchandise—the total value of goods sold by merchants on the platforms, rather 
than the revenue of those platforms—flowing through these three platforms represented up to 
42 percent of total e-commerce retail value in 2023.79 This large share is attributable to several 
factors: the big investments that e-commerce companies need to make in delivery logistics, the 
companies’ economies of scale, and the mutually reinforcing network effects of a two-sided 
marketplace. Customers find more value in a platform with many merchants, and vice versa.

However, emerging contenders are disrupting the status quo, rapidly scaling through innovative 
strategies. At least four key elements pose challenges to the incumbents, as follows:

First, DTC sales could capture a larger share of the industry’s revenues. Companies such as Casper 
and Warby Parker sell to customers without a retail middleman. These sales are supported by third-
party logistics providers such as Shopify that help smaller companies establish and maintain online 
retail systems (including those built into social media platforms). 

Second, the growing popularity of online food purchases—the grocery segment was worth $8 trillion 
in annual global revenues in 2023—could open the field to emerging contenders if they can succeed 
in food e-commerce.80 However, the large e-commerce incumbents are also competing in food, as 
Amazon did by buying Whole Foods in 2017 and offering delivery.

Third, because e-commerce could grow most quickly in emerging markets, companies that specialize 
in those regions could take a significant share if they enhance services for local consumers. For 
example, China’s Tencent expanded at a 14 percent CAGR from 2018 to 2023, buoyed by the 
popularity in China of its social media platform WeChat, which allows users to chat, post, and 
purchase in one “super app.” In Latin America, Mercado Libre’s marketplace ecosystem recorded a 
59 percent CAGR from 2018 to 2023.81 Key features, such as an integrated payment option for Latin 
American countries and localized services for sellers, have helped the platform maintain its market 
position in a region with rapidly growing internet penetration. 

Last, regulations in some markets that aim to limit the size and influence of e-commerce players 
could lead to more fragmentation in the industry.

Swing factors
 — How might social commerce change the industry structure? 

 — To what degree could e-commerce develop in categories that currently are mostly nondigital, 

such as healthcare?

 — Will adoption be faster or slower in regions with lower e-commerce penetration than in more 
mature markets? The pace could be influenced by factors such as regulation; by supply-side 
constraints, such as logistics infrastructure; or by governmental restrictions. 

 — How much could gen AI and other new technologies affect e-commerce? Could they kick off an 
escalatory race that draws new entrants? Or will technological advances be incremental and 
mostly used by the large incumbents to solidify their market position?

 — How might innovations in physical retail influence the trajectory of e-commerce?

2. Artificial intelligence 
software and services

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a machine’s ability to perform cognitive functions that we usually 
associate with humans.82 Some types of AI, such as machine learning, have been around for decades 
(these primarily numerical techniques used for applications such as prediction, categorization, and 
optimization can be described as “analytical AI”), while others are newer (although built on previous 
technologies). The most prominent is generative AI (gen AI), which uses unstructured inputs, most 
often prompts from a natural language such as English, to generate unstructured outputs. These are 
outputs such as text, images, audio, video, and computer code that aren’t typically represented in the 
rows and columns of a spreadsheet or database.

We define this potential arena as services and software that incorporate AI, such as those that use 
natural language processing, predictive analytics, and other AI algorithms and functionalities. We 
excluded the hardware required to operate the technology, including components to run AI systems 
such as processing units and chips designed by companies such as Nvidia (which are covered in the 
semiconductors entry in this compendium).

The promise of gen AI became apparent in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a service that 
responds to users’ questions and instructions with remarkably humanlike written answers. Since 
then, AI has made headlines and excited markets. Investors are flocking to companies developing 
advanced AI and particularly to those focusing on gen AI: equity investments in that technology 
jumped from $5 billion in 2022 to $36 billion in 2023. In an April 2023 McKinsey survey, nearly a third 
of respondents reported that their organizations were using gen AI regularly in at least one business 
function, and 40 percent reported that their organizations would increase their investment in AI 
overall because of advancements in gen AI.83 By early 2024, ChatGPT had more web traffic than such 
giants as Netflix, Pinterest, and Twitch, according to a survey by FlexOS on gen AI platform usage.84 

Predicting the future of an industry that has so recently grabbed the world’s attention is difficult. 
Yet despite this uncertainty, there are already identified opportunities along the gen AI value chain, 
including building end-user applications and model hubs, and providing the tooling for machine 
learning or large language model (LLM) operations. There are additional opportunities for new 
applications of AI technologies, such as gen AI–enabled agents that act in the world, and the more 
expansive potential for systems whose scope of capabilities is sufficiently broad to be called artificial 
general intelligence.85 In the meantime, systems tailored for specific applications are being built with 
customized AI models using techniques such as fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation.86 
And there is still plenty of headroom for the adoption of analytical AI. As companies seize these 
AI-enabled opportunities, the industry could become an arena. Given the rapid pace of development 
and breakthroughs in AI, many aspects of this field will likely undergo considerable change by 2040, 
with significant potential for outsize growth and dynamism over the next two decades.

Growth
Developments in analytical AI and gen AI are poised to drive the industry’s growth by improving 
business and worker productivity. In our modeled scenarios, the arena’s revenues grow from 
$85 billion in 2022 to $1.5 trillion in a lower range of scenarios in 2040 and to $4.6 trillion in a higher 
range of scenarios, a CAGR of 17 to 25 percent.87

Past McKinsey research analyzed more than 500 uses for AI and estimated their potential economic 
impact, which would have two components.88 The first is the economic value added by analytical 
AI—such as machine learning and deep learning—which could amount to an estimated $9.4 trillion 
to $15 trillion in 2040.89 For instance, analytical AI could revolutionize vehicle maintenance by better 
predicting failures, cutting operational costs in the transportation industry up to 10 percent. Or it 
could help clinicians detect rare diseases in patients more quickly by processing and analyzing large 
data sets of images.90 

The second component is the economic value added by gen AI. About $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion  
of that annual value would come from gen AI enterprise use cases, and about three-quarters of 
that value would be in four areas: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, 
and R&D. These use cases include those that reduce costs as well as those that increase revenue 
for individual firms, overall increasing productivity in the economy. But these enterprise use cases 
do not account for all the productivity gains of individual knowledge workers, automating aspects 
of their occupations. Incorporating all these cases of individual worker productivity enabled by 
gen AI in addition to the enterprise use cases could unlock a total of $6.1 trillion to $7.9 trillion of 
value annually.91

Adding these components together yields our estimated range of total economic potential of 
$15.5 trillion to $22.9 trillion annually by 2040. The actual amount will likely depend on two factors: 
how quickly AI is adopted and the technology’s effectiveness. To reach the $22.9 trillion figure, the 
vast majority of the 500-plus use cases would have to be adopted around the world, and enterprises 
would have to achieve reduced costs and improved productivity. In practice, companies could most 
effectively implement these new technologies through transformation of business domains rather 
than individual use cases.92 

To arrive at our estimates of the potential arena’s revenues, we multiplied the full economic value 
by the 10 to 20 percent of it that technology providers typically capture. Here, if the economic 
impact was $15.5 trillion in 2040, and if 10 percent of that amount was captured by AI companies, 
the companies’ revenues would come to $1.5 trillion, the amount estimated in our lower range of 
scenarios. If the economic impact was $22.9 trillion, and if AI companies captured 20 percent of it, 
their revenues would come to $4.6 trillion, the amount estimated in our higher range of scenarios.

The actual capture rate will likely depend on the industry’s competitive dynamics. If a few AI software 
and services companies can differentiate themselves from their competitors by means of advanced 
technological capabilities, those companies may be able to set prices higher and produce a capture 
rate closer to 20 percent. If many companies are battling fiercely for business, they may have less 
pricing power and a lower capture rate.

Dynamism
The AI software and services industry can be described as having two segments, one nascent with 
the advent of gen AI, and another that is a natural evolution of the software industry. Their market 
dynamics and player composition may change over the next 15 years.

The first segment consists of companies that train “frontier” foundation models—that is, the biggest, 
most advanced models, which can perform a variety of tasks by using expansive artificial neural 
networks and enormous sets of varied data. (For example, the GPT models by OpenAI, Gemini by 
Google, Claude by Anthropic, and Command by Cohere are frontier models with language and 
increasingly multimodal capabilities, such as processing images.) This segment of the industry 
currently has a few major players because building a foundation model requires access to massive 
amounts of data, capital, and infrastructure. Those requirements can pose challenges even to 
large, established technology companies. Another factor creating barriers to entry is this segment’s

dependence on the semiconductor industry, because that technology can be expensive and scarce, 
giving an edge to companies with access to large amounts of capital (and cutting-edge talent). 

This advantage can become a virtuous cycle that keeps industry leaders ahead as a result of the 
difficulty a competitor might have in creating industry-leading frontier models. The first escalating 
barriers to entry are the high training costs and huge amount of computing power required to build 
frontier models. For example, Meta plans to deploy 350,000 Nvidia H100 AI chips, with a value of 
more than $9 billion.93 However, some experts believe that the advent of more open-source models 
as well as smaller, often more customized models may lead to more fragmentation even among 
foundation models, potentially altering this industry segment’s composition.

The industry’s second segment consists of companies that produce software and services that are 
enabled by AI and fulfill a wide variety of specific needs in the economy. For example, companies 
recently funded by the start-up accelerator Y Combinator plan to use AI to serve clean-energy 
developers, behavioral health companies, logistics vendors, and fashion designers as clients.94 
Specialized AI software and services may be based on the frontier foundation models or on models 
that require less investment to train. Frameworks and techniques could be layered onto the models to 
build solutions that cater to specific use cases. For example, retrieval-augmented generation could 
be added to larger gen AI platforms to help users gather information from verified data repositories, 
creating a tool designed to answer specific questions accurately.95 Also, many customers of AI 
software and services will require full solutions, that is, integrated offerings that include building 
applications, integrating software, access to foundation models (and compute power), and software 
maintenance and servicing.

This segment largely resembles the overall software market: it is fragmented because of the huge 
variety of needs and applications, and new competitors continually emerge and outcompete 
established ones. AI could be applied in almost all industries, vastly increasing the number of specific 
uses and creating significant space for new entrants. Barriers to entry would be low, and the large 
companies training frontier foundation models could focus on just a few of the most profitable and 
scalable use cases, rather than tailoring their products more narrowly for hundreds of them.

Swing factors
 — Will AI continue to be constrained by the limits in the capacity of the semiconductor industry’s 

ability to supply chips, or will another constraint such as limits on electrical power emerge as a key 
bottleneck in AI development and deployment?

 — How will governments act to shape the burgeoning AI arena? How will they approach regulation? 
How might some governments invest in “sovereign AI,” that is to say, an interest in having AI 
systems developed within their borders? How will AI regulation and capital flow differ in China, 
Europe, the United States, and elsewhere? How will regulations on intellectual property, safety, 
and the size of AI companies interact with geopolitics across different markets?

 — How will the distribution of value evolve among players that train foundation models, those that 
provide software based on those models, and the businesses and consumers they serve, for 
example with the release of some open versus proprietary models? Are AI models a long-term 
source of value? Will they commoditize or be captured through open source? 

 — How will pricing models evolve? How will training costs be managed? How will the various players 

across the AI value chain capture value as costs and pricing models change over time?

 — Is AI a supporting feature or capability of the software industry, or is it an entirely new modality of 

how we use technology that will transform the software industry?

3. Cloud services

Cloud services providers, the largest of which are often referred to as hyperscalers, offer IT services 
over the internet, including on-demand IT infrastructure and platforms as a service. Cloud services 
have been historically divided into three segments: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as 
a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). IaaS offers computing and storage resources 
over the internet, PaaS offers platform services that allow users to develop apps that can put those 
resources to use, and SaaS consists of software provided over the internet. In practice, IaaS and 
PaaS are deeply integrated, so we consider them one offering in our analysis. In addition, the types of 
infrastructure and platform services that cloud providers offer continues to expand, for example by 
encompassing capabilities enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Our definition of the cloud services 
arena includes only the integrated IaaS/PaaS segment. With the growth in AI as a part of software, 
an increasing amount of SaaS is covered as AI software and services (also identified as a potential 
arena). That said, since all cloud providers are likely to see themselves as AI providers, and cloud is 
necessary for the computation-at-scale requirements of AI, these two arenas are inextricably linked. 

By introducing new technologies, optimizing operations, and scaling, the cloud services industry 
can deliver services with more resiliency, enable more agility, and foster more innovation than 
“on-premises” infrastructure and platform solutions run by corporate IT departments. Over the 
past decade, more and more computing has shifted to the cloud from individual corporate systems, 
enterprise-owned data centers, and local networks. A survey estimates that around 94 percent of 
enterprises use cloud services.96 As a result, industry revenues have grown sharply—from $32 billion 
in 2017 to $270 billion in 2023.

The cloud services industry is already an arena, as described in chapter 1, and is likely to remain one. 
In an increasingly connected world, companies will need more and more computing and storage 
capabilities. The Internet of Things (IoT), for instance, often requires the public cloud’s ability to store, 
process, and analyze data on a massive scale. Companies have scaled up their cloud capabilities: 
over the past decade, Walmart has built a hybrid cloud platform that runs more than 1 million CPU 
cores and can execute 170,000 backend adjustments to the retailer’s website each month, 1,700 
times more than could be achieved with earlier capabilities.97 Cloud migration at scale can also bring 
benefits in other industries, such as the financial and automotive sectors. For instance, autonomous 
vehicles are now generating and recording thousands of parameters in real time that would require 
the cloud to store and process and feed into R&D. AI also needs this computing ability, and smaller 
providers focusing on the AI market have recently entered the cloud services industry.

As the cloud opens up the potential to reallocate where computing gets done, some specific 
workloads could be intentionally deployed “at the edge,” that is, on local computing systems. 
These include applications with low latency requirements (including real-time applications such as 
autonomous vehicles or manufacturing) or where security/privacy concerns could be mitigated by 
constraining data to specific devices. And many workloads will be spread across cloud and edge, 
resulting in hybrid solutions. 

The rate of cloud migration may be slower than some expected due to large time and investment 
needs—companies with cloud programs profiled by McKinsey increased their cloud adoption by 
only 5 to 10 percent between 2022 and 2023.98 However, migration of workloads to the cloud 
is also expected to continue. By 2030, cloud services could generate $3 trillion of EBITDA 
increases for Forbes Global 2000 companies by helping them digitize core operations, accelerate 
product development, and more.99 This means value remains on the table: cloud players still have 
opportunities to harness returns on investments on cloud at scale.

Growth
We anticipate that cloud adoption could grow further as a result of continued enterprise migration 
to cloud services and increased demand for cloud services to meet the computational needs of new 
technologies. We excluded SaaS in our estimates because it occupies a separate competitive space 
from cloud infrastructure/platforms; pure software companies and infrastructure-and-platform 
providers operate differently, compete in different markets, and have different financial models. 

Global external IT spending was about $3 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $8 trillion in 
2040, a 6 percent CAGR. These outlays are distributed across key areas, such as hosting, network, 
cybersecurity, and application development and support. Our estimates include spending on public 
cloud service providers and exclude internal labor cost. The cloud services industry’s 2022 revenues 
accounted for 8 percent of global IT external spending. In our estimates, the industry could represent 
between 19 and 41 percent of that spending by 2040. In our analysis of today’s cloud arena, the 
industry’s revenues grew at 17 percent CAGR from 2005 to 2020. They could continue to increase at 
a similar rate, or growth could be slightly moderated to a 12 percent CAGR. Revenues could increase 
from $220 billion to $1.6 trillion in the lower range of scenarios and to $3.4 trillion in the higher range 
of scenarios in 2040.100

Our scenarios are based on two factors: first, companies continue to migrate their traditional 
computing and storage processes to the cloud.101 Despite the strong growth of cloud services over 
the past decade, a 2023 survey of enterprises with more than $1 billion in revenues found that only 
about 20 percent of their workload was in the cloud, and most planned to more than double that 
share by 2026.102

This continued migration would increase the share of cloud expenditures in overall hosting and 
networking IT spending. In addition, the cloud could capture a larger share of cybersecurity outlays, 
as certain on-premises cybersecurity software services migrate to the cloud. 

In the higher range of scenarios, migration happens quickly, and the cloud industry captures more 
spending from hosting, networking, and cybersecurity. In the lower range of scenarios, migration is 
slower and, in some cases, reverses for certain workloads (such as cloud “repatriation,” the process 
of moving applications from the public cloud to private infrastructure). Slower cloud migration and 
increased repatriation could have several causes, including malfunctions or breaches at cloud 
providers, data protection laws, and security and privacy concerns (for example, national security 
concerns for defense-related industries).

The second factor underpinning our estimates is the computational requirements of newer 
technologies—such as AI, IoT, and virtual reality—that could boost demand for cloud services. The 
need for computational power of generative AI (gen AI) models is particularly high during the training 
phase, which typically involves computationally intensive operations, but the volume demand 
for inferencing (the use of these models) could also rise as AI adoption increases (though some 
inferencing could also be deployed at the edge). Many in the AI industry have highlighted insufficient 
computing power and limited availability of graphics processing units (GPUs) as the key bottlenecks 
in the development of the technology. Nvidia, a leading player in the AI technology market, has 
announced plans to meet this growing need by shipping 1.5 million AI server units that will consume 
85 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity a year by 2027,103 representing 25 to 35 percent of the 240–
340 TWh of energy that cloud data centers used globally in 2022 (see the entry for semiconductors 
in this compendium).104 The rapid growth in AI services may continue to drive significant demand 
toward cloud services. In the higher range of scenarios, AI technologies grow more quickly and 
businesses require large amounts of cloud service to enable that growth. In the lower range of 
scenarios, businesses do not employ these technologies as widely, so the need for additional cloud 
services is limited.

Dynamism
The cloud services industry has few major players; its four largest companies currently account 
for about 60 percent of total revenues. In 2023, Amazon Web Services (AWS) took in 31 percent, 
Microsoft 20 percent, Google 7 percent, and Alibaba 3 percent.105 These companies have grown 
thanks to significant network effects, scale and scope advantages, and high barriers to entry. To 
be competitive, providers must make very large investments, particularly in data centers: the three 
companies with the highest capital expenditures from 2016 to 2021 (AWS, Microsoft, and Google) 
invested more than $380 billion over a five-year period, nearly 60 percent of the industry’s total. 
With companies migrating more of their workloads to the cloud, competition may intensify as cost 
and convenience become more important to customers. Achieving competitive pricing and migration 
experiences also requires large amounts of R&D.

In the long term, the industry may continue to have just a few large players given its escalatory 
dynamics and global radius of competition. Large companies are already investing heavily in 
acquisitions to help them offer more specialized services. 

However, data sovereignty regulations106 and new investments in different regions of the world could 
cause some fragmentation by enabling the emergence of regional competitors. Yet even in that 
scenario, investment and economics of scale would probably leave room for only a few surviving 
competitors in each region. In addition, the global presence of major hyperscalers will likely allow 
them to adjust to data sovereignty rules and continue to compete in regional markets.

Cloud services tailored for AI—a rapidly growing segment within the larger cloud-services industry—
could lead to shifts in market share among companies. Such services give clients the tools and 
infrastructure they need to develop, train, and deploy AI and machine learning models at scale. A 
few new players have cropped up; for example, specialized GPU cloud providers have grown quickly 
due to their data centers and services tailored to meet the unique needs of AI model training and 
deployment. The largest companies in the cloud services industry, including Microsoft and Google, 
also offer “frontier” foundation AI models, which clients can use to create more specialized models. 
It is easy to imagine that the fierce competition for performance among frontier models could shift 
share among cloud providers. 

Swing factors 
 — How costly and challenging will cloud migration be?

 — Will the massive volumes of data in legacy systems make it less cost-effective for enterprises to 

transfer workloads to the cloud?

 — Could there be regulatory concerns particularly about concentration risk? Could this drive 

companies to use private infrastructure rather than the public cloud?

 — How will increasing data residency regulations and sovereign AI impact the adoption of public 

cloud for enterprise workloads?

 — How could gen AI adoption accelerate cloud adoption, and how would it shift corporate budget 
allocations among IT, product, R&D, and other areas? For instance, could generative AI make it 
cheaper to build applications? Will AI workload demand surge as anticipated, or can businesses 
optimize training processes that will reduce this demand in the cloud?

 — If a catastrophic failure or cybersecurity attack occurred at a major provider, what potential 

scenarios could unfold?

4. Electric vehicles

The technology to build electric vehicles (EVs) has existed since the invention of the automobile in 
the 19th century, and electric cars vied with steam-powered and gas-powered vehicles well into the 
20th century. The introduction of the Ford Model T, the proliferation of cheap gasoline, and the use of 
internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles during World War I eventually led to mass-market adoption 
of the gas-powered vehicle. 

More recently, however, EVs have been mounting a global comeback as concerns about CO2 
emissions from traditional ICE vehicles made them an attractive alternative. With recent 
investments in technology, they have become increasingly practical and mainstream—in 2023, 
EVs accounted for 18 percent of all new passenger cars sold globally. Between 2010 and 2019, 
breakthroughs in battery capacity and efficiency increased the range of the average battery 
electric vehicle (BEV) from 130 kilometers to 340 kilometers. In the same period, the launch of 
lower-cost EV models brought down the average purchase price from $55,000 to $37,000, a 
decrease that put the total cost of ownership of many EVs over their lifetime roughly on a par with 
that of a comparable ICE car.107

At the same time, EVs are getting a boost from mandates and timelines in several countries seeking 
to eliminate the use of ICE vehicles. That includes a law approved by the European Union in 2023 that 
effectively banned the sale of many new ICE vehicles by 2035, and mandates in Canada and the state 
of New York requiring that 100 percent of new passenger vehicle sales be electric in the next 10 to 
15 years.108

As a result, the EV industry became one of today’s arenas, as described in chapter 1. Plenty of signs 
indicate that it could be one of tomorrow’s, too. EVs are growing significantly faster than the rest 
of the automotive sector. Overall annual passenger vehicle sales are projected to increase at a 
modest rate, from 74 million in 2023 to 79 million in 2030. By contrast, global passenger EV sales are 
projected to increase fourfold, from 13 million in 2023 to between 31 million and 46 million in 2030, or 
about half of the total annual sales of all cars forecast for that year. 

Escalatory competition has been ramping up in the global EV market. Chinese EV companies have 
begun exporting to global markets, with OEM BYD overtaking Tesla in global EV sales in the fourth 
quarter of 2023 and Chinese brands accounting for about 50 percent of global BEV sales. Other 
OEMs are looking to compete. BMW reached one million cumulative EVs delivered in the first quarter 
of 2024, with sales up more than 25 percent year-on-year.109 Ford’s electric vehicle sales were up 
85 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2024, even as the company has delayed production of 
new electric pickups and SUVs.110

However, the market has seen some slowdowns, such as delayed electrification targets of some 
OEMs, and in 2024 experts revised EV sales growth projections downward for the first time. There 
are concerns that early adopters have already purchased their first electric vehicles, and the next 
wave of potential adopters may have stronger concerns about price and range that would slow 
growth. But even with these recent headwinds, EVs are still experiencing strong growth, though 
it is less accelerated than in the vehicles’ early years. R&D investment in EVs remains a priority, 
and EV-focused companies continue to spend more than traditional carmakers. In 2023, Tesla 
spent $4 billion on R&D, or about $2,200 per car, 1.2 times more than what Ford spent, and almost 
3.0 times Toyota’s spending.

Growth
The growth of EVs responds to the continued prioritization of sustainability by consumers and 
governments, lower lifetime costs of ownership, escalatory competition to improve quality, and 
enabling investments in charging infrastructure and electricity supply and distribution. Our estimate 
of electric vehicles’ growth includes revenues attributable to producers of BEVs, plug-in hybrid 
electric vehicles, and fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which run on hydrogen. We include both 
passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles such as trucks and vans.111 We exclude hybrid vehicles 
that don’t have the ability to be plugged in to recharge, as well as vehicles powered by natural gas.

To obtain our estimate of revenues for the entire EV industry, we included the sales of electric 
passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles, including heavy-, medium-, and light-duty trucks, as 
well as light commercial vehicles. In our estimates, revenues would grow from $450 billion in 2022 
to $2.5 trillion in the lower range of scenarios and to $3.2 trillion in the higher range of scenarios by 
2040, implying a CAGR of 10 to 12 percent. In 2023, revenues were $590 billion.

In 2023, 18 percent of all new passenger vehicles sold globally were EVs. However, the sales numbers 
vary by region: in China, almost 30 percent of new passenger vehicles were EVs; in Germany, 
30 percent; in France, 20 percent; in the European Union, 16 percent; and in the United States, 
8 percent. In July 2024, more than half of the vehicles sold in China were “new energy vehicles,” 
including BEVs and plug-in hybrids.112 In our estimates, the global share increases to between 82 
and 96 percent by 2040. Projections also vary greatly by region. In high-penetration regions like 
Norway, the EV share of passenger car sales could grow from about 90 percent currently to 100 
percent, while lower-penetration countries such as Nigeria could see that share growing to only 15 to 
22 percent by 2040. As a result, industry revenues from passenger EVs could grow from $530 billion 
in 2023 to between $2.0 trillion and $2.3 trillion in 2040, implying a CAGR of 8 to 9 percent. In 2023, 
revenues were $530 billion. With EV sales estimated to overtake ICE sales sometime between 2025 
and 2030, most of this growth would come from replacing traditional ICE sales, whose share would 
decline by a corresponding amount (Exhibit 1).

Electric vehicles could account 
for about half of global passenger 
vehicles sales by 2040.

Among commercial vehicles, by contrast, the share of BEVs and FCEVs sold was only about 4 percent 
in 2023 (Exhibit 2). In our estimates for 2040, that share would grow for medium- and heavy-duty 
trucks to between 60 and almost 90 percent in regions of high penetration, such as Europe, where 
regulations aid EV adoption. In regions with medium penetration, such as the United States and 
China, the estimated share is 40 to 80 percent. In the rest of the world, that share could grow to 
between 10 and 50 percent. To reach these shares, however, battery electric trucks could require 
either significant improvement in battery energy density or reduced payloads compared with 
traditional diesel trucks, which could challenge the economics of the trucking industry. An alternative 
to BEVs would be a higher share of FCEV trucks, which do not face the same range and payload 
trade-offs but would need a major scale-up of hydrogen refueling stations and development of a 
robust hydrogen supply chain. Because of this trade-off, some medium- and heavy-duty trucking use 
cases such as long-haul freight could be suited to FCEV power trains. However, heavy-duty trucks 
in use cases with more predictable downtimes and distances driven per day, such as those used for 
garbage, sanitation, or local distribution, are more likely to use BEV power trains.

By contrast, light-duty trucks and light commercial vehicles are likely to be primarily BEVs. This 
is because these smaller trucks and commercial vehicles are much lighter and so will not face as 
stark of a range and payload trade-off as heavier trucks. For example, Tesla’s Cybertruck weighs 
roughly 3,000 kilograms (kg); the battery alone for a heavy-duty garbage truck can weigh more 
than 7,000 kg. EVs’ share of vehicle sales for these lighter segments is estimated to be 85 to 
almost 100 percent in regions of high penetration such as Europe and China; between 50 and 
almost 100 percent in the United States, which has medium penetration; and between 30 and 
80 percent in the rest of the world. 

Taken together, revenues from EV light commercial vehicles and light-, medium-, and heavy-duty 
trucks combined would grow from $42 billion in 2022 to between $540 billion and $900 billion in 
2040, implying a CAGR of 15 to 19 percent. In 2023, revenues were $53 billion. 

Four main factors are driving growth to the higher or lower end of that range: consumers’ willingness 
to pay a premium for sustainable vehicles, EV cost and quality, charging infrastructure, and the supply 
and distribution of electricity to the charging infrastructure.

Willingness to pay a purchase premium for sustainable vehicles and policy incentives. The 
global effort to mitigate climate change and reduce carbon emissions is driving governments and 
consumers toward lower-emissions options. In 2023, ground transportation globally accounted 
for roughly seven gigatons of CO2 emissions, or about 20 percent of global emissions, making it a 
priority sector for emissions reduction.113 These considerations help power consumer demand, with 
57 percent of all global car buyers in the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM) consumer 
sentiment survey for 2024114 stating that sustainability was a primary factor when purchasing a new

car, though this varies hugely across regions. In the United States, only 49 percent said sustainability 
was a primary factor. In China, the figure was 59 percent, while in Germany it was 43 percent. 

These concerns also drive policy. Governments around the world are offering incentives for EV 
purchases, and the EU and 12 US states have instituted bans on new ICE vehicle sales that will take 
effect in 2035.115 In the United States, buyers of many new EVs receive a tax credit of up to $7,500, 
and buyers of heavy commercial EVs could receive a tax break of up to $40,000 per truck under the 
2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).116 Chinese EV buyers receive tax exemptions worth $2,000 to 
$4,000 on EV purchases, and in major Chinese cities, EVs receive preferential vehicle registration 
that can save car purchasers meaningful money or time. The strength of continued consumer 
demand and political pressure for lower carbon emissions will determine whether this factor drives 
growth toward the higher or lower end of our estimates.

EV cost and quality. Several technological factors drive EVs’ cost and quality, and they could 
determine whether revenues tend toward the lower or higher end of our range. By 2023, most EVs 
had reached parity with comparable ICE vehicles on total cost of ownership over the vehicle’s lifetime, 
though this depends on the region, car make and model, usage profile, and available subsidies. 
However, this parity has limited impact on consumers, who are largely more sensitive to purchase 
price than to a complicated calculation of the total cost of vehicle ownership over many years. And 
EVs remain meaningfully more expensive to purchase than comparable ICE vehicles. 

The battery is a main driver of EV cost and accounts for 30 to 40 percent of the total cost of a vehicle. 
Several forces affect battery prices, with more than half the cost of a lithium-ion battery coming from 
its raw materials. Prices of lithium, a critical raw material, have been volatile, increasing about fivefold 
from January 2021 to January 2023 before falling back to 2021 levels by January 2024. Supply 
dynamics could also affect battery prices. Even though identified global lithium reserves are four times 
larger than the amount that would be needed to supply batteries for projected EV sales between 2022 
and 2040, meeting EV demand could still require a three- to fivefold surge in lithium production. 

The rapid proliferation of EVs is also likely to add to the demand for other key materials such as 
cobalt and nickel. Yet EV battery pack prices have fallen significantly over the past decade, thanks 
to technological improvements and economies of scale, which caused costs to plummet from 
thousands of dollars per kWh in the early 2000s to under $100 per kWh today. McKinsey’s Battery 
Insights team forecasts that the cost could to continue to decline to $50 to $75 per kWh by 2040, 
mostly driven by continued technological improvements in energy density. While the price of the raw 
material inputs is volatile and harder to predict, designers have managed to adapt the mix of materials 
in batteries (for example, by reducing the amount of cobalt used) and may be able to keep doing 
so (for example, by using cheap, abundant sulfur). In addition, batteries can be recycled to reclaim 
the raw materials within them, as some companies are already doing and some regulations already 
require. If those trends continue, they could help keep down future prices in the event that the price 
of raw materials spikes.

Battery lifespan can be another concern for EV buyers. Recent research has suggested that 
batteries tend to last for the lifetime of a typical vehicle, about eight to 12 years, depending on 
how far they are driven. A 2024 survey of 20,000 EV drivers found that less than 1 percent of cars 
manufactured since 2016 required battery replacement, compared with 13 percent for cars made in 
2015 or before.117 Most EVs do not use a full battery cycle—charging to 100 percent and depleting 
to zero percent—but instead charge to about 80 percent and avoid falling lower than 20 percent, 
which can significantly improve battery lifespan. And fast-charging a vehicle doesn’t seem to make a 
meaningful difference in battery lifespan, as long as the fast charge does not fully cycle the battery. 
See further discussion in our “Batteries” entry in this compendium. Range also influences EVs’ rate 
of growth. About 70 percent of consumers in a February 2024 survey by MCFM agreed or strongly

agreed with the statement, “I am anxious about buying an electric vehicle because of the limited 
driving range.” This “range anxiety”—the worry that a single charge might not allow an EV to go as 
far as an ICE car—is their biggest concern about owning an electric vehicle, and about 30 percent 
of those surveyed said insufficient range is their primary reason for not purchasing an EV. According 
to a previous MGI analysis,118 however, passenger BEVs are already able to meet most use cases in 
driving range. In the United States, the median range of a BEV is about 400 kilometers, which would 
be sufficient for about 80 to 90 percent of journeys made without having to recharge by average US 
households. The average driver in the United States drives close to twice as far each year as drivers 
in Australia, France, and the United Kingdom, implying that the share of use cases currently met by 
BEVs would be even higher. Thus, the rapidity with which EV car design, battery technology, and 
electric power trains improve will determine whether some consumers will be able to overcome range 
anxiety and purchase a vehicle. 

Charging infrastructure. The sheer scale of the infrastructure needs for EV charging introduces 
factors that could limit the industry’s growth. While the infrastructure to distribute and sell gasoline 
around the world was built up over decades, the public and private chargers for millions of EVs would 
have to be built at scale in less than a decade to meet growing EV demand and to achieve climate 
goals. Although public charging infrastructure grew at a rapid rate of about 50 percent annually from 
2018 to 2023, this growth was heavily driven by China, which accounts for about 70 percent of global 
public charging points. Other regions have struggled to keep pace with the growth of EV sales: there 
are eight EVs per public charging point in China, 14 in Europe, and 30 in the United States. Charging 
infrastructure would need to be built in homes, offices, shopping centers, and along highways, to 
name just a few locations. We estimate that 135 million charging points may be needed globally by 
2030 to meet EVs’ energy demand, nearly five times the 25 million charging points installed by 2023, 
including about 15 million public chargers. 

This infrastructure requires substantial investments. About $2 trillion in global capital expenditures 
may be needed until 2050 to build the public and private charging infrastructure required to meet 
EV demand.119 While EV charging infrastructure (EVCI) is likely to become a meaningful industry in its 
own right, whether it can scale up sufficiently to support growing EV adoption is unclear. Profitability 
for public EVCI operators is highly dependent on the utilization rate, which is a function of how 
many EV drivers are nearby, and EV demand is capped by consumer concerns about the availability 
of public charging. Timing will be critical: scaling up too slowly would limit consumer EV demand; 
scaling up too rapidly could mean large losses while EV adoption catches up. Many public-charging 
operators are operating at a loss, investing in a network in hopes that it delivers future profits. Some 
legislative efforts (such as the US IRA) have aimed to encourage EVCI network building, but it remains 
to be seen whether those measures will spur enough EVCI investment fast enough to allay concerns 
about charging availability.

Electricity supply. The EV industry could also be limited by the supply and distribution of electricity 
to the charging infrastructure. To power the more than 240 million EVs on the road just by 2030, we 
estimate annual electricity needs would grow from around 140 million megawatt-hours (MWh) in 
2022 to more than one trillion MWh by 2030, representing about 3 percent of future global electricity 
generation.120 This electricity would also need improved transmission and distribution infrastructure: 
many of the 26.5 million chargers projected to be built in private settings (such as those in homes, 
offices, and retail locations) may need the local utility to install improved substations that can handle a 
larger load than the current infrastructure. Timing is important as well. Many EVs are charged at night, 
so there will be a need for better energy storage solutions as well as renewable power generation at 
night (for example, excluding solar). 

And to deliver on its promise of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the electricity powering EVs 
would need to come from low-emissions sources. Because the manufacturing process for EVs

emits more carbon than the making of an ICE car does, it can take 30,000 to 80,000 kilometers 
of driving for passenger cars and 35,000 to 65,000 kilometers for heavier sport utility vehicles to 
break even on their lifetime carbon emissions on grids such as those in Europe and the United States. 
Typical vehicles in the United States and Europe are driven distances of about 150,000 to 250,000 
kilometers, so BEVs may produce emissions that are 20 to 60 percent lower than top-performing ICE 
vehicles in their lifetimes. For heavier vehicles and in areas where the grid is more carbon intensive, 
that break-even point gets further away (a heavy SUV on a carbon-intensive grid such as India’s may 
not reach carbon breakeven during its expected lifetime). If EVs fail to deliver on their promise to 
reduce carbon emissions, consumers and governments may not continue to support their growth.

Dynamism
The EV market, which currently features a few large players, has seen increased numbers of Chinese 
players and EV-focused new entrants alongside traditional manufacturers that have existing 
competencies in manufacturing and are competing at scale. In the early 2010s, Chevrolet and Nissan 
started selling plug-in electric cars, followed closely by Tesla. These manufacturers were able to gain 
large market shares in the early years because there were fewer players and limited models were 
offered. They could move quickly and scale up in EVs before other carmakers entered the market. 
Notably, Tesla successfully scaled up Model 3 production, gaining up to 40 percent share of the US 
market in 2018.121

Fast-forward to today, and the market still has just a few large players. In 2023, the five largest 
EV producers, led by BYD, controlled about 50 percent of total EV production, while the top five 
players accounted for only 35 percent of the overall passenger car market, still led by ICE vehicles.122 
Nonetheless, there have been many new entrants into the EV market, both start-ups, such as 
Polestar and Lucid, and major automotive OEMs, such as Ford and Hyundai. And in China, an entirely 
new ecosystem has developed around EVs, with vertically integrated players such as BYD. The 
rapidly expanding Chinese domestic market for EVs features just a few larger players, with the five 
biggest Chinese companies combined selling 60 percent of all EV units sold in 2023.123

Chinese companies such as BYD and Geely have also increased their EV sales massively outside of 
China: in 2023, they produced about 50 percent of EV units sold globally. In Brazil, four of the top five 
EV sellers were Chinese companies, selling a combined 80 percent of EV units in the country.

New entrants have found fertile ground in EVs: in 2023, about 50 percent of new EV units were 
produced by companies that sold more EVs than ICE vehicles. Part of the reason new entrants 
are finding success in the market is that the embedded capital and skills of the traditional ICE 
incumbents—such as their expertise in building ICE power trains and managing an extremely 
complex network of suppliers—did not confer a strong enough advantage to these incumbents to 
prevent new entrants from successfully entering the market. This is an example of the escalatory 
dynamic we explore in chapter 2, in which a technological step change can open up the bottom of a 
new S-curve, enabling the entry of disruptive new players.

However, OEMs that sell more ICE vehicles than EVs still occupy a major role in the industry and are 
increasingly investing in EVs. However, the dynamics are different in different markets. In Norway, 
OEMs that sell more EVs than ICE vehicles sell about half of EVs, whereas in Brazil, new EV entrants 
have a roughly 70 percent market share, with BYD leading at more than 36 percent of EV sales.124

The game could play out in many ways. The older automakers have some advantages, including, 
above all, the expertise necessary to manufacture products at large scale. But EV-only companies 
also have an advantage: a laser focus on EV power trains. EV-only companies can streamline their 
research, design, and manufacturing operations to focus solely on electric vehicles, while traditional

automotive OEMs must continue to optimize across a wider portfolio of EVs and ICE cars, and may not 
be able to optimize for EV production in the same way. In addition, expensive battery packs are the 
heart of every EV, and the R&D invested in enhancing battery performance could prove even more 
valuable than the ability to build the rest of the car. EV-only companies could successfully entrench 
themselves in the market by capitalizing on first-mover advantages, scaling up and bringing down 
prices, and offering customers higher quality, such as better range. And players in either group 
may continue to integrate vertically, as BYD has done with battery production and even battery raw 
material mining; the carmaker is involved in lithium mining from China to Chile. 

Swing factors
 — Will more consumers be won over to EVs as electric vehicles get better and the infrastructure 

expands, or are there deeper consumer preferences toward ICE cars beyond just solving for cost 
and convenience?

 — Will the industry be successful in ramping up mining to meet raw material demand at the right 
speed to match the growing demand in EV batteries? If not, how will the swings in price and 
availability along the EV supply chain change the trajectory of the industry?

 — How will the pace of the energy transition, including government support for it, affect the EV 

market? Depending on the development of the market, will bans on ICE vehicle sales remain in 
place or be reconsidered? 

 — Will the buildup of public charging infrastructure be sufficient to meet EV demand?

5. Digital advertising

Digital advertising funds an enormous swath of the internet by providing an increasing percentage of 
its revenues.125 Growth in digital ads is expected to continue, indicating that the industry could be one 
of the arenas of tomorrow.126

There are several reasons to believe digital ads will continue to expand their reach. First, more 
people around the globe are coming online and joining the global middle class, resulting in more 
consumers for companies to target with digital advertising. Second, consumers are spending more 
time with media, and increasingly in digital forms, resulting in both an increased volume of novel ad 
products and more demand from advertisers. Third, the digital shift is creating more innovation in, 
and better performance from, ad products. The digital shift also lowers costs for advertisers to enter 
the market (for example, generative AI, known as gen AI, reduces the cost of content creation). This 
generates more demand and expands the total addressable market. Last, more places to display 
advertising are emerging, and ads are becoming a more important revenue model for non-traditional 
advertising sectors such as e-commerce, retail, last-mile delivery, banking, and telecom, especially 
in developing economies.

Digital ads could also see high dynamism. Several factors contribute to this: the evolution of walled 
gardens (closed platforms where providers have full control over content and consumer data), the 
impact of gen AI on traditional search and on small and midsize business (SMB) access, regulatory 
and data privacy actions, the rise of social media influencers, the convergence of commerce and 
advertising, and shifting consumer behavior.

Growth
Digital advertising is expected to continue to grow faster than GDP. In our estimates, revenues 
from digital advertisements increase from $520 billion in 2022 to $2.1 trillion in the lower range of 
scenarios and to $2.9 trillion in 2040 in the higher range of scenarios, a CAGR of 8 to 10 percent.127 
Much of this growth comes from the ongoing shift in advertising spend from traditional to digital 
media: in 2022, digital advertisements accounted for 65 percent of total advertising, a share that is 
expected to grow to 80 to 90 percent by 2040 (Exhibit 1).

The growth of digital ads is primarily driven by four factors: growth of the global middle class, 
consumer attention moving to digital, the demonstrated ROI of digital ads, and new forms of  
digital media.

First, digital advertising may grow as more of the world comes online and more of the global 
population enters the middle class. This could increase the number of people that companies 
around the world are trying to reach and enable digital ways to reach them. In particular, developing 
economies and regions could see substantial increases in smartphone and broadband penetration 
bringing more consumers onto the platforms that serve digital ads and improving the effectiveness 
(and pricing) of those ads with more user scale and richer and broader data signals. For instance, 
the Asia–Pacific region, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa could achieve a smartphone 
penetration level of almost 90 percent as soon as 2026 (Exhibit 2). In addition, the ten countries 
with the largest projected increase in middle-class population from 2020 to 2030 are all developing 
economies. Collectively, these ten countries could have about 900 million people making the 
transition into the middle class in this period.128

Second, consumer attention will continue to shift to media, and increasingly to digital formats. 
Overall time spent on media has mostly been increasing across economies, but more notably in 
developing economies. For example, Indian consumers spent 225 minutes per day on average on 
media in 2016, and this could increase to almost 400 minutes by 2026, or a 6 percent CAGR, while 
Chinese consumers’ time spent on media could climb from 384 minutes per day in 2016 to almost 
500 minutes by 2026, a 3 percent CAGR. The share of digital media—where consumers are served 
digital advertising—in particular is increasing across economies. In the United States, digital media 
accounted for 40 percent of consumers’ media consumption in 2016. That could grow to 66 percent 
by 2026 (Exhibit 3).

Third, digital ads continue to demonstrate improving ROI. Digital ads offer advertisers more 
measurable formats, such as search and “performance” advertising, in which companies pay for 
clicks and measurable results instead of promoting general brand awareness. These formats also 
offer the ability to deliver ads to very specific and precise target audience segments, allowing 
advertisers to more efficiently deploy their advertising budgets and measure much more precisely 
their effectiveness.

The ability to execute targeted and highly measurable campaigns has enabled SMBs, which could not 
afford and did not benefit from broad-audience brand advertising on traditional media, to become a 
significant force in advertising. It is also increasing the overall number of advertisers substantially: 
in 2020, 200 advertisers supplied 88 percent of US TV ad revenue, while three million advertisers 
were on Facebook,129 the vast majority of which were SMBs. These SMBs will continue to expand 
the market as the shift to online video and connected TV opens up new digital advertising formats to 
smaller advertisers who would never advertise on traditional TV. 

New technologies such as gen AI are expected to make digital ads more effective by enabling 
hyper-personalization of content and could increase demand for digital ads by making digital ads 
cheaper and easier to produce. For example, the online used-car marketplace Carvana used gen AI 
to create 1.3 million bespoke videos aimed at individual customers. Each ad celebrated a customer’s 
car purchase in a personalized way.130 Virgin Voyages created a tool that uses the digital likeness 
of entertainer Jennifer Lopez (the company called the tool “Jen AI”) and allows customers to share 
personalized video invitations with friends.131

Fourth, new forms of digital media, such as retail media, video games, and digital out-of-home, are 
emerging. Many of these forms did not exist or had little scale a decade ago but are growing rapidly 
today. Innovative formats enable new players outside of traditional and digital media to sell ads, 
further increasing the supply of ads. Companies including Amazon, Chase, United, and Uber have 
added ads to their digital platforms. Video game platforms such as Roblox have increasingly used 
digital ads to boost revenues; digital advertising almost doubled as a proportion of global mobile 
gaming revenues, from 28 percent in 2017 to 51 percent in 2022.132

Advertising has also become an increasingly important revenue model for media companies. This 
is especially true in developing countries where consumer willingness to pay for media is low, 
contributing to the growth of advertising-enabled media models. For instance, around 60 percent 
of the 135 million monthly active Spotify users in Latin America, one of the fastest-growing regions, 
are on the free, ad-supported version of the application.133 In developed markets such as the United 
States, ad-supported tiers of the leading streaming platforms are emerging as both higher revenue 
and higher margin than subscription-only tiers. For example, in 2023 the ad-supported tiers of 
Discovery, Hulu, Netflix, and Peacock each had higher average revenue per user than their premium 
subscription tier.134

Dynamism
The industry benefits players with scale due to two-sided network effects of both users and 
advertisers: a larger pool of users and data enables better matching and signaling, giving advertisers 
incentive to continue placing advertisements on these platforms as performance improves. As of 
2023, four companies accounted for about 64 percent of the industry’s global revenues—Alphabet, 
with 30 percent, Meta, with 21 percent, Amazon, with 7 percent , and ByteDance, with 6 percent.135

The industry’s total addressable market may continue grow, but shifts in market shares remain 
uncertain. While large incumbents may still see growth, two questions are relevant in understanding 
how the industry’s structure may change: First, will the value from newly emerging revenue pools 
be captured by new entrants or by incumbents? Second, to what degree is the core business of

incumbents at risk of capture by new entrants? In a more disruptive scenario, new entrants may 
emerge and evolve into a new set of large players if outsize shifts occur.

Several major dynamics will likely determine how these share shifts play out in the next 15 years, 
across both the supply side, meaning the extent of advertising players can provide, and the demand 
side, or the channels where consumers will interact with ads and the number of advertisers and the 
share of revenue they spend on digital advertising.

From the supply side, several factors could change the industry’s structure, potentially shifting 
shares of current players. First is the degree to which walled gardens stay global. As new mixes of 
content and user data are emerging, the competitive position of existing walled gardens may be 
challenged. Because SMBs may drive regional growth, a new wave of walled gardens whose sizes 
and scopes would be more regional than global could emerge. 

Second are new formats. New form factors, such as virtual conversational agents that help 
consumers discover products, may provide new marketing experiences for consumers. The extent 
to which players succeed at creating innovative formats could drive large share shifts even among 
the existing players, and open up space for new entrants, though those new entrants would need to 
invest heavily in technologies such as AI in order to compete. The rise of influencers is an example 
of how an emerging format shifted shares in the industry; advertisers have reallocated spend to 
influencers and away from traditional paid media to reach more consumers.

Third is the convergence of commerce and advertising. The extent by which closed loops win out 
and how much commerce players move to invest in content could structurally change the industry. 
Commerce players have large amounts of consumer data, which they could leverage when expanding 
into advertising on their channels.

Fourth are regulatory and data privacy actions. Developments in local or regional policies, such 
as laws related to data collection, management, and residency, could have significant operational 
requirements for advertising companies that aspire to participate globally. These policies include the 
General Data Protection Regulation in Europe and the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, 
which is the subject of ongoing discussions.

From the demand side, the shifts in consumer behavior could change how and where advertisers can 
find consumers. For instance, channels in which consumers discover various products or services, 
and the ways consumers engage with brands such as through connected TV and app stores, can 
influence where consumer attention—and hence revenue—shifts. Consumer preferences could 
also move toward user-generated content and short-form videos such as those on TikTok. Ad 
expenditures follow consumer attention and spending; if new platforms attract more consumer 
attention, the relative ad spend on those platforms will also increase due to the supply factor of new 
advertising formats explained above.

The impact of gen AI has crosscutting effects on both supply and demand, affecting how advertisers 
can participate as well as changing customer behaviors. For one, gen AI could transform how 
consumers navigate media and the internet. For example, it could disintermediate traditional search 
and allow customers to discover information or products directly, thereby creating a new channel for 
ad placements. Gen AI also democratizes content creation by making it cheaper and easier for SMBs, 
which can now advertise in more formats.

Swing factors
 — As new walled gardens emerge, how will the interoperability between platforms evolve, and how 
will ad delivery enablers including “open ad tech”—the ecosystems on the open web that connect 
advertisers and publishers—and ad agencies respond? 

 — How will gen AI affect the customer journey, from brand to product and from discovery to 
purchase, including potentially disintermediating search? How will it affect the degree of 
consolidation or democratization of digital content? 

 — Which emerging media formats—for example, augmented reality and virtual reality, metaverse, 

and wearables—will create new channels of customer attention, and how will advertisers adapt to 
deliver ads using these new formats? 

 — How will brand advertising change as performance advertising becomes increasingly common, 

and where will brand advertising spend be directed? 

 — How might additional ad inventory coming onto the market affect prices and margin? At what level 

will inventory growth boost the overall market, and when will it just lead to lower prices?

6. Semiconductors

Semiconductors, sometimes called microchips or integrated circuits, are the invisible building 
blocks of the digital world. Their ubiquity and importance were highlighted during the COVID-19 
pandemic, when a surge in demand led to supply shortages of not only computers, smartphones, and 
other consumer electronics but also of cars and household appliances, all of which rely heavily on 
microchips.136 In the early years of the 21st century, as semiconductor manufacturers chased smaller 
and smaller distances between chips’ transistors, a disaggregated business model appeared, with 
some “fabless” companies designing chips and other companies specializing in manufacturing them 
in factories called “fabs.” Those shifts made the industry one of today’s arenas, as we describe in 
chapter 1. From 2005 to 2020, its revenues grew by a CAGR of 7 percent. 

The industry could be one of tomorrow’s arenas, too. Some recent technological trends, such as 
AI, machine learning, robotics, and autonomous driving, are likely to boost demand for complex, 
domain-specific chips. Generative AI (gen AI) is expected to generate 0.2 QFLOPs (quettaFLOPs) 
of computational demand in 2024.137 By 2030, demand for gen AI computational power alone 
could increase to 25 QFLOPs, an annual rate of growth of about 125 percent.138 And increasing 
global prosperity is likely to continue to drive demand for electronics in developing markets. The 
semiconductor industry is investing heavily in R&D and manufacturing: total capital expenditures 
increased at a CAGR of 16 percent from 2015 to 2022, though there was a dip in 2023.139 
Furthermore, many governments, including those of China, the European Union, and the United 
States, are offering the industry significant subsidies to bolster domestic manufacturing.

Growth
Increased demand in several markets could drive the growth of semiconductors. About 80 percent 
of this growth could come from four market segments: computing and data storage, automotive, 
wireless communications, and industrial electronics (exhibit). This industry could continue to escalate 
R&D and capital expenditures to efficiently meet rising demand, as seen by continuous node resets 
and the emergence of fabs. In our modeled scenarios, the semiconductor industry’s revenues grow 
from $630 billion in 2022 to $1.7 trillion in a lower range of scenarios in 2040 and to $2.4 trillion in 
a higher range of scenarios, a CAGR of 6 to 8 percent.140 In those scenarios, prices increase by an 
average of about 2 percent a year, and supply and demand are balanced in the long run (though there 
is often some shorter-term volatility, as a result of boom-and-bust cyclicality and the impacts of other 
factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic).

Computing and data storage. In our scenarios, revenues from semiconductors that are used in this 
segment grow from $230 billion in 2022 to between $480 billion and $890 billion in 2040, a CAGR of 
4 to 8 percent. Most of that growth would be fueled by demand for semiconductors used in servers, 
though chips for PCs, storage, and peripherals would also play a part.

The higher end of these scenarios yields the $890 billion market size and is based on the following 
underlying dynamics:

 — The AI and cloud services industries grow very quickly and need servers to support them (see 

“Cloud” and “AI and software services” in this compendium). For example, Nvidia’s data-center-
specific revenue grew 427 percent in the first quarter of 2024 compared with the first quarter of 
2023, with 87 percent of the company’s overall revenues attributable to data-center solutions.141 
Industry leaders have already signaled their intention to sharply increase AI investment: Google’s 
DeepMind is expected to surpass $100 billion in total AI spending, and Microsoft and OpenAI are 
reportedly considering building a supercomputing cluster worth $100 billion.142

 — Demand continues to increase for higher-value chips for servers, such as graphic processing 

units and AI accelerators, which are now employed mostly by cloud services companies and high-
performance computing users.

 — Demand for computing in developing countries rises quickly as their economies grow.

In the lower range of these scenarios, which yields the $480 billion market size, the magnitude of 
each of these factors is lower: the AI and cloud services industries grow less quickly, the higher-value 
chips for servers do not reach spending parity with standard ones, and demand for computing in 
developing countries grows less quickly.

Automotive. In our scenarios, revenues from semiconductors used in vehicles grow from $60 billion 
in 2022 to between $300 billion and $390 billion in 2040, a CAGR of 10 to 11 percent. While overall 
automotive demand rises modestly over this period, averaging about 1 percent a year, growth is 
primarily driven by the increasing value of semiconductors in the average car, which was $600 in 
2022 and by some estimates could reach $1,400 by 2028. That increase, in turn, is driven by three 
trends. The first is a growing share of electric vehicles, which can need roughly ten times as many 
semiconductors as traditional vehicles, on average. In addition, traditional vehicles are increasing 
their use of semiconductors. Second, driving assistance features, which require sensors and 
computing power, become more common. Third, cars’ “infotainment” systems grow increasingly 
sophisticated, including more head-up displays, digital instrument clusters, and rear-seat 
entertainment.

Wireless communications. In our scenarios, revenue from chips used in wireless devices grows from 
$180 billion in 2022 to between $400 billion and $500 billion in 2040, a CAGR of 5 to 6 percent. 
About half of that growth comes from increasing demand for smartphones, particularly as they 
become more common in developing economies. The rest of the growth comes from chips used in 
other wireless devices and infrastructure. Actual revenues in 2040 will depend on how rapidly people 
shift to mid-tier, high-tier, and 5G-enabled smartphones, which use more expensive semiconductors.

Industrial electronics. In our scenarios, revenues from semiconductors used in industrial 
electronics grow from $75 billion in 2022 to between $200 billion and $300 billion in 2040, a 
CAGR of 6 to 8 percent. These semiconductors are used in a variety of industries that are expected 
to grow quickly, such as medical electronics, industrial automation, and electricity generation  
from renewable sources.

Dynamism
The semiconductor industry has four major types of players: fabless designers such as Nvidia, which 
design chips; foundries such as TSMC, which manufacture them; integrated device manufacturers 
(IDMs), such as Intel and Samsung, which do both; and companies such as ASML that sell specialized 
manufacturing tools to the foundries and IDMs. The semiconductor industry features a few large 
players, and companies that offer better or cheaper products typically hold a majority of the global 
market. This is especially clear in specific technology segments along the value chain. For example, in 
2022, ASML captured 87 percent of the $18 billion worldwide lithography equipment market;143 Intel, 
78 percent of the $62 billion market for central processing units; Nvidia, 84 percent of the $20 billion 
market for graphics processing units; TSMC, 63 percent of the $107 billion foundry market; and 
Samsung, 37 percent of the $144 billion memory segment.144 These five segments make up more than 
half of total semiconductor market revenues. 

Although the industry seems likely to continue to feature a few large players, companies’ market 
share could be changed by a move, already under way, from general-purpose to domain-specific 
chips. The shift derives from the growing popularity of fast-growing applications for semiconductors, 
such as machine learning, 5G, and the Internet of Things. For those uses, domain-specific chips can 
help reduce energy consumption. The adoption of these chips could increase the share of the market 
held by fabless designers, which could provide a larger portfolio of solutions.

The move by tech companies outside the industry to design their own semiconductors instead 
of buying them could also shift market shares. Apple has designed processors for its mobile 
devices and, more recently, for its computers. Meta and Alphabet have designed chips to suit 
their requirements. And Tesla is designing chips for autonomous driving. If this trend persists, 
these tech companies could capture market share from the fabless chip designers such as Nvidia. 
Although huge share shifts in chip manufacturing will likely be harder, given the large amounts of 
capital required to compete with TSMC in the global chip foundry market, it is reasonable to expect 
increased competition in this space as geopolitical considerations drive countries to diversify their 
chip-manufacturing supply chains.145

Swing factors
 — How will evolving national policies and geopolitical shifts affect regional and global markets? 

 — What will happen to the market for AI-specific chips as incumbents, cloud services companies, 

and start-ups try to gain market share?

7. Shared autonomous  
vehicles

Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are road vehicles that have no human driver and can be hired 
to transport passengers for a fare. The industry is in its infancy. However, many companies are 
designing purpose-built SAVs, and several are already road testing regular vehicles enabled with 
autonomous technology. 

The SAV industry’s rapid technological development is a sign that it could become an arena. Although 
autonomous vehicles were first tested in academia in the 1960s, development took off with the 
DARPA Grand Challenge contests starting in 2004. SAV development has been led by companies 
such as Apollo (owned by Baidu), AutoX, Cruise (owned by GM), Pony AI, and Waymo (owned by 
Alphabet). Robo-taxis are already in service in some US cities, such as Phoenix and San Francisco, 
and in China in the cities of Beijing, Chongqing, and Wuhan.146

Furthermore, from 2010 to 2021, more than 400 companies—mainly venture capital and private 
equity firms, followed by big tech and automotive OEMs—reported a total of more than $100 billion 
in investment in robo-taxis and robo-shuttles.147 Although venture capital and R&D investments in 
SAVs in the United States fell from a peak of $25 billion in 2019 to $3 billion in 2022, the mobility 
industry more broadly has experienced an uptick in investments from late 2023 into 2024.148 Recent 
investments in the SAV industry have included Alphabet’s plan, announced in July 2024, to invest 
an additional $5 billion in its autonomous technology provider, Waymo.149 This variable investment 
sentiment suggests that commercialization in the industry may go more slowly than some previous 
forecasts had indicated. 

Growth
The potential for outsize growth in the SAV arena is based on sustained technological progress, 
a compatible regulatory environment, the financial feasibility of broader adoption, and consumer 
acceptance. The broader shared mobility industry changed dramatically in the first decade of the 21st 
century as regional and multinational tech companies, beginning with Uber, began competing with 
traditional taxi companies by offering ride-hailing services. As of 2022, taxis still garnered 58 percent 
of the industry’s global revenues of $1.2 trillion, while ride-hailing services took in 14 percent. The 
remainder was earned by car-sharing and car-rental services, shuttle services, and micromobility 
services, such as those that let people rent bicycles from curbside racks. We exclude the revenues of 
mass transit operators from our definition of the industry.

In our scenarios, SAVs could capture 25 to 51 percent of the shared mobility industry’s revenues by 
2040, taking market share from human-driven taxis and ride-hailing services. Because the pace 
of technological development and adoption of SAVs is uncertain, our range of estimates for the 
industry’s revenues in 2040 is wide: between $610 billion and $2.3 trillion (Exhibit 1).

To estimate the industry’s potential size, we considered the revenues that it could earn by 
transporting passengers in fully autonomous vehicles, which have what the industry calls level four 
or level five automation.150 Such vehicles might include robo-taxis or robo-shuttles. We excluded 
autonomous vehicles that would not run on roads, such as trains, and those that would fly (which we 
discuss in the entry “Future air mobility”). We also excluded personal vehicles, even though many of 
them might have automated driving systems by 2040.151

Several factors will determine the industry’s revenues in 2040.

The first factor is technological progress. Significant obstacles stand in the way of operating self-
driving cars safely and reliably. Teaching cars to identify objects, people, and animals on roads is a 
challenge, and so is making sure that the vehicles can continue navigating in bad weather. Although 
companies are making impressive headway, some of the challenges remain, because the array 
of circumstances that will need to be taken into account will grow over time as SAVs spread to 
increasingly complex and unpredictable environments.152 As a result, SAVs are likely to first emerge 
in the center of cities, which offer the highest density of potential passengers, and find cities where 
weather conditions are less likely to cause issues for sensors.153 Unforeseen problems can arise, even

in the areas that have already been selected. SAVs need to anticipate accidents and be equipped to 
respond to them.

Second is the regulatory environment. There are myriad unanswered social and political questions: 
how would liability for accidents be distributed between SAV manufacturers, operators, and 
riders? Do we measure the safety of an autonomous vehicle versus a human driver, or should a 
different standard be applied? What vehicle registration process would be mandated for SAVs, and 
what powers should law enforcement or government have over the vehicles? Some countries and 
jurisdictions have started issuing guidelines for autonomous driving.154 However, globally, regulatory 
risks continue to be one of the biggest impediments to autonomous-vehicle adoption. In a 2021 
survey of executives from automotive, transportation, and software companies, 60 percent said 
that they viewed insufficient regulatory support, rather than technological obstacles or low demand, 
as the factor that is most likely to limit the adoption of autonomous driving.155 In a 2023 McKinsey 
survey of autonomous-vehicle leaders, the percentage of respondents who said that regulation is the 
biggest bottleneck for the industry remained at 60 percent.156

A third factor that will determine the industry’s revenues is financial feasibility. Deploying SAVs 
at scale requires significant capital investment, and considerable outlays are needed to attain 
profitability. The cumulative capital outlay requirement is projected at about $50 billion to $67 billion 
through 2030.157 In a capital-constrained environment, commercialization might occur more slowly 
because only a limited group of profitable markets will emerge. Although the initial price tag is high, 
the capital required to manufacture SAVs is expected to shrink over time. Some manufacturing  
costs associated with traditional vehicles could be reduced by eliminating parts that are redundant  
in an SAV. 

In addition to capital requirements, the unit economics of operating SAVs would also dictate the 
industry’s course. In our scenarios, operational costs that are lower than those of alternative modes of 
transportation would encourage adoption. Once the industry is mature, the cost of a trip by SAV could 
range from 60 percent less than the cost of using a personal car to 30 percent more, depending on 
whether a person is traveling alone or pooled.158 The cost could be 30 to 80 percent lower than using 
a ride-hailing service (Exhibit 2).159 The savings result from lower labor costs (because SAVs have 
no human drivers) and lower fuel and maintenance costs (because computer-directed driving could 
optimize fuel consumption and reduce maintenance requirements). SAVs do have some operations 
and management costs that human-driven cars do not, such as remote operations support centers 
that assist vehicles in emergencies. However, these additional costs are expected to be offset by the 
lower per-trip cost of SAVs.

Fourth, the degree to which consumers are willing to choose shared mobility of any kind will affect 
the size of the SAV industry. This is influenced by both consumer sentiment and regulations. We 
estimate that roughly 40 percent of all passenger miles were traveled in shared vehicles in 2022. In 
our scenarios, that share in 2040 would range from 40 percent in the low case to 60 percent in the 
high case.160 The share could be pushed up by regulatory changes in large cities, such as license 
plate rationing and the imposition of congestion charges.161 It could also rise if people became less 
willing to own their own cars for reasons related to convenience, cost, safety, or the environment, 
for example. 

Dynamism
The SAV market is nascent and is likely to show high dynamism as the arena grows. An SAV product 
needs to bring together three things: the autonomous driving technology, the physical cars, and the 
shared mobility service that plans trips, logistics, and interfaces with the customer. This makes the 
industry particularly dynamic as competition emerges from companies that currently excel at each

one, with technology providers, ride-hailing companies, and carmakers approaching the industry 
from different angles.

The autonomous technology providers, such as Baidu’s Apollo, GM’s Cruise, and Alphabet’s Waymo, 
are the furthest along today. They plan not only to operate fleets but also to build the technology 
necessary for autonomous driving. Some of those companies will probably procure vehicles from 
established carmakers and then integrate software into them; Waymo uses Jaguars, for example. 
Others, like Cruise, might be owned by carmakers and use vehicles built by their parent company.

Carmakers, too, might play a role by equipping their vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities 
and then selling them to other companies.162 Tesla has stated ambitions to enter the SAV market, and 
Volkswagen aims to supply self-driving vans to ride-hailing companies.163

By contrast, ride-hailing companies might end up procuring the technology and cars they need from 
others. Ride-hailing companies will have various competitive advantages from their experience 
operating mobility services, including existing reputations, existing customer bases, and developed 
platforms. For example, Uber has partnered with both Waymo (2023) and Cruise (2024) to make their 
shared autonomous vehicles available on Uber’s platform.164

There are significant escalatory factors that create tendencies toward eventual consolidation. The 
extensive amount of research and development needed to develop autonomous vehicles creates a 
high barrier to entry for technology providers, encouraging consolidation within the industry and with 
carmakers. There are also high barriers to entry for operating a shared autonomous vehicle service; 
as with today’s ride-hailing operators, there are strong network effects and cost advantages to scale 
that encourage consolidation. These factors could create a market led by a few key players along with 
some smaller regional companies. Similar dynamics have emerged in today’s ride-hailing industry. 

Of course, the emergence of SAVs would also shift market share in the broader shared mobility 
industry. We could see a disruption similar to that of the early 2000s, when the shared mobility 
industry’s composition began tilting away from local taxi companies and toward the regional and 
global ride-hailing companies that offered customers convenience and lower costs. In the same way, 
SAVs could disrupt the industry by offering customers a cost-effective alternative to ride-hailing. 

Swing factors
 — How quickly can SAV manufacturers overcome key technological hurdles, such as increasing 

range and mobility beyond geofencing, reducing reliance on remote interventions, and creating 
purpose-built platforms that enable positive unit economics?165

 — How will regulations governing autonomous driving affect the SAV industry? And how will policy 

makers determine operators’ and owners’ liability for SAV-related accidents?

 — How will the evolution of SAVs affect consumer sentiment and future competition in the market 

(for example, product differentiation by vehicle amenities)? 

 — How will the business model differ across the industry’s three kinds of companies—autonomous 
technology providers, ride-hailing companies, and carmakers (for example, different offerings, 
customer base, and impact of regulations)? 

 — Will players experience regionalization of their tech stack due to regulations, data limitations, 

privacy mandates, and restricted access to high-end semiconductors?

8. Space

Since the first moon landings over 50 years ago, most of the demand for space endeavors has 
been driven by government interests rather than commercial opportunities. Over the past decade, 
however, the industry’s commercial sector has seen robust growth. Because of this surge of  
interest, commercial applications like remote satellite connectivity could help make space an  
arena of tomorrow.

Several space companies have accelerated growth in the past decade. SpaceX, one of the most 
active commercial service and infrastructure players, provides internet service via its Starlink 
system—a constellation of more than 5,000 small satellites—and offers launch services (more than 
300 launches as of June 2024).166 In addition, the company is testing Starship, a fully reusable launch 
system that could carry humans for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. Other companies have 
also been exploring space tourism: Virgin Galactic carried passengers to the edge of space and 
back twice in the first half of 2024 and plans to enter commercial service by 2026.167 Planet Labs, 
another space services company, provides imagery of the Earth’s landmass several times a day (for 
example, to enable data-driven agriculture). And Origin Space, a Chinese space mining company, has 
launched satellites into low Earth orbit to collect debris and assess space resources; it aims to begin 
commercial asteroid mining by 2045.168

Alongside private companies, governments around the world continue to shape the space arena by 
increasing their investments and deepening their collaborations with private players. For example, 
NASA awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to three private companies to develop competing 
designs for a lunar terrain vehicle.169 At the same time, some government-backed missions have 
succeeded at a relatively low cost: India’s Chandrayaan-3, which landed on the moon, had a 
$74 million budget—less than was spent on some Hollywood space movies, such as Gravity and 
Interstellar, that had budgets of more than $100 million.170 More nations are entering the space race, 
too. For example, Saudi Arabia is seeking to diversify its economy by promoting scientific research 
and boosting national security via space, while Peru has launched the “Internet para Todos” program 
to enhance internet connectivity in rural regions using satellites.171

Four key trends have transformed the space industry over the past decade and are helping to pave 
the way for space products and services to become ubiquitous. 

First, launch costs have decreased exponentially. For example, when adjusted to 2021 dollars, low-
Earth orbit heavy launch costs have declined by more than 95 percent, from $65,000 per kilogram in 
1980 to $1,500 per kilogram in 2021.172 Second, commercial innovation makes it possible to do even 
more in space. Commercially available applications now allow for identification of objects on Earth 
at a resolution of 15 cm, a 20-fold increase compared with an initial resolution of three meters. Third, 
investment is flowing from a wider group of investors to a larger and more diverse set of applications. 
Private-sector investment in space is reaching all-time highs, with more than $70 billion invested 
in 2021 and 2022 combined.173 Fourth, there is excitement over, and interest in, the latest space 
developments, with government and business leaders considering what space could enable for 
the future. 

Growing investment and interest in space could dramatically change our lives by helping to address 
a wide range of challenges. For example, space-based Earth observation could help identify 
infrastructure risks by monitoring structures, such as dams and nuclear power plants. Developments 
in satellite data and analytics could transform disaster relief efforts by providing real-time information 
to shorten response time during humanitarian crises, quickly identify affected populations, and 
optimize coordination of first responders and evacuations.

Space-based capabilities could also help bridge current digital divides separating developed and 
developing nations by providing access to high-speed internet, education, and healthcare services. 
And space technologies could provide precise monitoring of agriculture, natural resources, and 
environmental changes. The advancements not only would bring financial gains but could also help 
alleviate global challenges like climate change and hunger.

Growth 
The space industry consists of two segments, commercial and government. Over the past decade, 
the space industry has been tightly linked to government policies. With growing commercialization 
and expansion of downstream services, the space industry could produce strong growth in 
both segments.

These two segments each divide into two subsegments. The commercial segment consists of the 
services and end-user equipment subsegment, and the infrastructure and support subsegment; and 
the state-sponsored segment is divided into the civil subsegment and the defense and intelligence 
subsegment (exhibit).

For all four subsegments, we considered the industry’s “backbone,” which includes satellites (such 
as those used for space-based communications), launchers, services such as satellite TV and 
GPS, and applications with revenues that are directly attributable to space hardware and service 
providers. A report by McKinsey and the World Economic Forum published in April 2024 describes 
this backbone in greater detail.174 The report also looks at a “reach” component, defined as the wide 
range of industries that are or would be enabled by the space backbone’s solutions and services but 
are not a direct product or service of a space provider. Reach services include delivery providers like 
Uber Eats that leverage satellite signals, and logistics companies like Amazon that use space data 
to monitor and optimize fleet traffic. In this article, we focus on the backbone solutions and services 
that are core to the space arena, but we note that the reach component is a critical driver of demand 
for the space economy.

In our scenarios, the space industry’s revenues grow from $300 billion in 2022 to $960 billion by 
2040 in the lower range of scenarios and to $1.6 trillion in a higher range of scenarios, a CAGR of 7 to 
10 percent.175 The commercial segments of the industry may grow between 6 and 9 percent a year 
from 2022 to 2040, and the state-sponsored segments may grow at a slightly faster pace, between 
7 and 10 percent a year, as countries accelerate investment in the space race.176 In 2023, revenues 
were $330 billion (62 percent from the commercial segments and 38 percent from the state-
sponsored segments).

The commercial services and end-user equipment subsegment, including communications and 
commercial positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) solutions, is projected to grow from $180 billion 
in 2023 to between $420 billion and $690 billion in 2040 (a CAGR of 5 to 8 percent). Communication 
services will likely remain the largest source of commercial revenue, with new constellations 
extending the reach of satellites to meet demand for connectivity in remote areas that aren’t covered 
by existing technology. Aided by large constellations, such as SpaceX’s Starlink and Amazon’s Project 
Kuiper, the data price for commercial satellite communications has decreased rapidly; a Euroconsult 
report estimated a 77 percent decline in data prices in the five years through 2024.177 As these 
constellations progressively reach full deployment, the decrease in data prices could continue, albeit 
at a slower rate. At the same time, lower cost, reduced latency, and greater coverage could increase 
the demand for data by 60 percent (in gigabits per second) between 2023 and 2035 as consumers 
seek affordable options for remote connectivity.178

PNT solutions are likely to continue to build on free signals from state-sponsored satellites to 
provide commercial positioning and navigation. This service could continue to grow as more people 
adopt smartphones and sport watches (three billion devices with GPS receiver chips could be 
manufactured every year by 2035, up from two billion today).179

The commercial infrastructure and support subsegment is projected to grow from $22 billion in 
2023 to between $120 billion and $220 billion in 2040 (a CAGR of 10 to 14 percent) as growing space 
investments help accelerate the deployment of commercial infrastructure to support the demand for 
space services and as companies continue seeking greater space presence and scale. 

This subsegment will likely have two major tailwinds for growth.

First, satellites are becoming cheaper, as technological advancements increasingly allow 
constellations to be built from small units at scale. This, in turn, promotes more manufacturing to 
enhance connectivity and observation capabilities.

Second, infrastructure players are developing reusable heavy rockets, which can launch satellites 
at a lower cost per kilo of payload. Launch costs have already decreased significantly and could 
decrease 40 percent more between 2023 and 2035.180 Growth in this subsegment could be driven by 
the reusability and increase in size of the vehicles, which improve launch economics.

State-sponsored investments, including in the defense and intelligence and civil subsegments, 
are likely to remain the cornerstone of the space arena’s expansion over the next 20 years, with 
continued growth spurred by incumbents and new entrants. Government agencies are expected to 
remain key customers, especially for high-end products and services. 

The state-sponsored civil subsegment is projected to grow from $59 billion in 2023 to between 
$180 billion and $270 billion by 2040 (a CAGR of 7 to 9 percent) as it benefits from increased efforts 
to develop new use cases of space assets. Many organizations have only explored the surface of 
space applications and are creating strategies to increase impact. For example, the European Space 
Agency is seeking to engage potential partners in three areas: sustainability, economic growth, 
and resilience on Earth and in space. New, tailored space applications could enhance research, 
risk anticipation, and disaster response efforts. For example, when Tropical Cyclone Idai landed 
in Mozambique, the British Geological Society was able to use satellite data to produce a hazard 
classification of rainfall-triggered landslides that was then used by civil protection teams to bolster 
disaster relief efforts.181

In addition, many countries are seeking to improve their space capabilities. The number of space 
agencies has grown from 40 in 2000 to more than 75 today.182 For example, the United Arab Emirates 
created a space agency, launched a mission to the International Space Station, and sent a probe to 
Mars within a decade. India has also expanded its space presence and became the fourth country 
to land a spacecraft on the moon in 2023 after a failed attempt in 2019.183 The country is increasing 
its space efforts with the goal of launching a solar observatory and supporting entrepreneurs in the 
private space and satellite sector.

The state-sponsored defense and intelligence subsegment is projected to grow from $66 billion in 
2023 to between $240 billion and $410 billion in 2040 (a CAGR of 8 to 11 percent) as nations increase 
spending to strengthen their national security and autonomy. While the United States spends about 
twice as much on space programs as the next ten countries combined, other nations are beginning to 
increase their expenditures.184 China, in particular, has achieved an approximately 20 percent CAGR 
in estimated space outlays, compared with about a 12 percent CAGR in the United States from 2018 
to 2023.185 According to a report by the US Space Force, Defense Innovation Unit, US Air Force, and 
US Air Force Research Laboratory, China “continues to compete toward a strategic goal of displacing 
the US as the dominant global space power economically, diplomatically and militarily by 2025.”186 
These trends will likely add weight to requests to allocate more funding to space programs.

In all four subsegments, varying trajectories of technological evolution and the ability of players in 
the space arena to achieve scale and wide adoption could determine whether the market size will be 
closer to the lower range of scenarios or the higher one. 

In our higher estimate of the space industry’s revenues, we assume that improved access to 
data collected from space and the standardization of that data may create new revenue streams, 
particularly for software application and analytics players. For example, aggregating and classifying 
space data with user-friendly and easily distributable structures could improve access. Data of this 
kind could enable use cases for non–space players, such as feeding the data into AI to better manage 
a supply chain network. At the same time, cost reductions across the value chain from space-vehicle 
manufacturing to ongoing space data reporting may accelerate adoption and the accessibility of the 
space economy. 

In the lower range of scenarios, we assume that cost curves stay steady as economies of scale 
take longer to achieve, hindering expansion of space-related activities. In addition, while examples 
of terrestrial alternatives are limited, future technological advances could be viable substitutes 
for traditional space-based solutions, affecting continued interest in sectors such as satellite 
communications and navigation.

The development of new space technologies over the next two decades could unlock revenue 
potential in a number of reach industries beyond the backbone segments in the space arena, such 
as transportation and logistics.187 In many cases, services that improve product quality and access 
as well as drive efficiencies will likely be created or enhanced by leveraging space-based data. For 
example, data from satellites that powered the global rise of the ride-hailing service Uber could 
enable faster and more efficient last-mile delivery for perishable goods, food, and beverages. We 
estimate the range of the potential revenues of these space-enabled applications to be $1.4 trillion to 
$2.6 trillion by 2040.

Dynamism
The space arena has drawn increasing interest from the private sector. More than 600 start-ups are 
operating in the arena, up from 250 in 2010.188 In the past decade, about 1,800 companies worldwide 
have received private equity investments of about $290 billion, according to Space Capital.189 The 
top three companies by revenue represented roughly 10 percent of the entire market in 2023.190 
Escalatory patterns of investment, however, may lead to barriers to entry that favor early movers: 
for example, the first companies to send large-scale constellations to space for communications 
would be able to provide broader network coverage more quickly, harness network effects, and 
garner greater customer adoption. This race to the top for scale and a presence in space, coupled 
with expensive launch and infrastructure costs, could eventually limit the number of companies that 
can sustainably thrive on the space value chain (with some exceptions for specific space-based 
services). Barriers to entry include the need for substantial investment in R&D capabilities to innovate 
and demonstrate capability, compliance with stringent regulations, and the high risk of capital loss if 
space projects fail. Besides these dynamics that could limit the number of players, there are a limited 
number of buyers in certain segments of this industry.

Market dynamics, however, vary by subsegment. 

The commercial services and end-user equipment subsegment presents the lowest barriers to 
entry and will likely have the most players. A large number of specialized use cases allows for entry 
of new players that cater to specific sectors. For example, data analytics companies could leverage 
the use of space monitoring capabilities in a wide range of industries that have distinct needs such 
as agriculture and logistics. Data analytics companies with access to satellite data could help a 
transportation player enhance its mobility services by improving tracking and management of 
vehicles, reducing costs, minimizing downtime, and improving operational efficiency. Spire Global, 
for instance, uses a constellation of orbital nanosatellites to track ships at sea, allowing maritime 
companies to directly monitor their locations.191 Data analytics companies focused on weather 
services can help anticipate and mitigate risks along transportation routes, minimizing delays and 
ensuring safety of delivery personnel. Players can leverage a broad array of data and capabilities and 
can tailor a unique value proposition to compete, leading to a more fragmented market that continues 
to see new entrants. 

The commercial infrastructure and support subsegment has fewer players than commercial services 
and includes companies such as SpaceX, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, and Blue Origin. Projects in this 
subsegment require significant R&D activity to succeed, raising barriers to entry. Companies that can 
reduce manufacturing costs and create new capabilities—with technology such as reusable launch 
vehicles—will likely gain an edge over competitors by managing launch processes more efficiently. 
For example, within the next two decades, the emergence of super-heavy rockets led by extensive 
R&D efforts at SpaceX could disrupt the subsegment by significantly reducing launch costs and 
lowering the number of launches needed. Super-heavy launches could capture about 70 percent of 
commercial launch market revenue, excluding the Chinese market, by 2035.192 The number of players 
could decline as small launch providers face competitors that offer lower launch costs using super-

heavy rockets. As a result, rocket manufacturing and launch services may become industry segments 
where a few large players have a majority of market share. 

The state-sponsored civil subsegment also has high barriers to entry. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, 
Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, and 
SpaceX are examples of companies operating in this space.193 Compared with the defense and 
intelligence subsegment, the civil subsegment offers more opportunities for players to enter because 
it covers a broader range of applications beyond just defense and intelligence, including scientific 
research and disaster management. This creates more diverse spaces for players to occupy, though 
civil services would still be government-funded and face strict mission requirements. For example, 
private companies other than defense and intelligence contractors can enter the industry via 
partnerships with government entities for use cases such as disaster response.

The state-sponsored defense and intelligence subsegment of space has relatively fewer players. 
They include Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon. Traditionally, larger 
players have benefited from a deep understanding of the contracting process and the resources to 
navigate it. This advantage could persist for established companies, especially those with cutting-
edge defense technology, strong engineering, and extensive contracting capabilities. However, as 
certain market segments become more fragmented, opportunities are emerging for new entrants, 
particularly smaller players in specialized niches. Procurement strategies are also becoming modular 
and agile, fostering increased competition and new avenues for growth. Moreover, the industry is 
shifting from constructing a small number of complex satellites toward larger satellite constellations 
with smaller units, which could create opportunities for new entrants. 

Swing factors
 — How might commercial interest in space continue to evolve and shape future innovation and 

commercially viable business cases?

 — How could new space data services increase the number of use cases and have an impact on 

various industries?

 — How would geopolitics affect the structure and distribution of the global market?

 — How might the role of government or government-backed organizations evolve? How could 
procurement and safety policies on both a national and an international level affect the 
subsegments differently?

9. Cybersecurity

The cybersecurity industry protects computer systems—computers, networks, cloud and web 
applications, network-connected manufacturing equipment, programs, and data—from unintended 
and unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. Unlike other software industries, this one 
owes its existence to a set of determined adversaries, including private hackers seeking ransom 
and nation-states advancing geopolitical goals. Because those adversaries keep improving their 
capabilities, the cybersecurity industry has no choice but to do the same.

Indeed, one indication that the cybersecurity industry could become an arena is that cyberattacks 
are becoming more frequent, complex, and costly. Marketplaces for hacking tools and data are 
growing. Generative AI (gen AI) has reduced the cost of mounting ransomware and phishing attacks. 
In addition, ransomware-as-a-service represents a growing threat. In these systems, developers 
provide tools to affiliates who lease them to malicious actors in exchange for a cut of the ransom. 
As the technical barrier to entry for cybercriminals has become lower, smaller firms have been 
increasingly exposed to attacks. In 2020, the full economic cost of cybercrime, including direct, 
indirect, and upstream systemic costs, was estimated to be in the range of $4 trillion to $6 trillion.194

The recent high level of innovation is another indication that the cybersecurity industry could 
become an arena. From 2017 to 2021, the number of patents issued increased at a CAGR between 
15 and 71 percent in three younger segments of the industry (cloud security, security operations and 
management, and cybersecurity for the Internet of Things and operational technology) and between 
15 and 20 percent for two more mature segments (data protection and network security). The rate of 
patent issuance in technology overall was only about 8 percent.195

Growth
In our modeled scenarios, the cybersecurity industry’s revenues could grow from $160 billion in 
2022 to $590 billion in the lower range of scenarios in 2040 and to $1.2 trillion in the higher range of 
scenarios, implying a CAGR of 8 to 12 percent.196 The share of all IT spending devoted to cybersecurity 
could grow from 6 percent in 2022 to between 7 and 14 percent by 2040.

In our low estimate of the industry’s revenues, cybersecurity spending increases only slightly more 
quickly than all IT spending.197 In our high estimate, cybersecurity spending as a share of total IT 
spending doubles between 2022 and 2040. Our range of estimates is based on the extent of the 
following factors.

First, attacks continue to increase, encouraging companies to spend more on protection. 

Second, the digital landscape continues to grow and change, broadening the attack landscape. 
Clients use more and more devices and apps, all of which need protection. They also generate more 
data, a great deal of which needs to be analyzed by cybersecurity companies to protect sensitive 
information. As a result, the responsibilities of the typical chief information security officer become 
far more expansive. 

Third, as the need for cybersecurity increases, new business models make the technology more 
appealing and accessible to small- and medium-size clients. Traditional consumption-based pricing 
models (which, for example, charge by the number of gigabytes of logs analyzed) work well for 
companies that have a sophisticated understanding of their needs and that are large enough to 
secure volume discounts. Smaller clients could be more likely to use newer pricing models. These 
include outcome-based models, in which the price of a cybersecurity product is based on meeting 
predefined levels of protection, and attack surface-based models, in which the price is based on the

number of servers or workloads protected. For these models to be profitable, cybersecurity providers 
might have to rely on AI to do much of the work.198

Fourth, cybersecurity-related regulations continue to increase. These often impose requirements on 
certain companies that create incentives for them to spend more on cybersecurity.

The extent of the impact of those four factors will help determine the industry’s actual revenues 
in 2040. For example, if geopolitical conflicts were to intensify, cyberattacks by nation-states 
could increase, boosting the need for governments and companies to spend on cybersecurity. The 
achievement of technological breakthroughs in such areas as AI and quantum computing could 
broaden the attack landscape more quickly. So could faster-than-expected adoption of the internet 
in developing countries.

The cybersecurity industry also faces a major challenge: a global shortage of talent. In 2021, for 
example, 3.12 million jobs in the industry went unfilled.199 That shortage could create pressure to use 
automation and AI to compensate.

Dynamism
The cybersecurity industry is highly fragmented; its ten largest companies generate less than 20 
percent of its revenues. Indeed, the cybersecurity industry is the most fragmented of all the possible 
arenas of the future we have identified in this report. However, cybersecurity could begin to see a 
few large players develop in individual industry segments over time as businesses scale to remain 
competitive.

The fragmentation has many causes. For one thing, the industry is highly diverse. It can be divided 
into 13 segments that address a variety of threats in different ways (see sidebar “The cybersecurity 
market has more than a dozen niche categories of business”), and those segments can be divided 
further into about 70 subsegments. Many of the segments, such as endpoint security and cloud 
security, focus on the protection of a particular technology; others, such as consulting, have a 
broader purview. 

Fragmentation is also the result of differing regulations from country to country.200 In addition, 
the role of nation-states in mounting cyberattacks encourages the proliferation of cybersecurity 
companies in different countries. Threats are constantly evolving and need new technologies to 
counter them. The barriers to entry for new companies are low. However, solutions that work for one 
client often need to be suitable for another. For many clients, cybersecurity is a “layered” solution, in 
which a variety of different products and services leads to better security. The growing shortage of 
workers with cybersecurity skills makes organizations particularly dependent on layered services to 
compensate for the lack of talent available. 

Nevertheless, a few larger players seem to be emerging as the industry matures, following the well-
established pattern of industries built on technical innovation. From 2012 to 2017, the number of 
new cybersecurity companies increased at a CAGR of 10 percent, and the number of M&A deals 
increased at a CAGR of 12 percent. From 2017 to 2022, the number of new cybersecurity companies 
declined at a compound annual rate of 34 percent, while the number of M&A deals kept growing 
(though more slowly than it had during the previous five years). The apparent decrease in the number 
of large players could reflect an increase in the scale necessary to compete. For instance, broader 
use of AI may require big proprietary data sets and higher up-front R&D spending. Also, vendors 
offering holistic solutions that are integrated among multiple cybersecurity applications may have an 
advantage, furthering the benefits of scale.

Sidebar: The cybersecurity  
market has more than a dozen 
niche categories of business

 — Identity and access management and 
fraud detection. Organizations use this 
process, known as IAM, to manage, 
provision, deprovision, and adjust user 
access to critical data, applications, and 
services. It involves tools across the 
value chain and allows both employees 
(a process known as workforce IAM) 
and customers (customer IAM, or CIAM) 
to securely onboard and verify their 
identity. In the fraud detection use case, 
for example, standard IAM processes 
are supplemented with additional data 
such as know-your-customer or KYC 
programs.

 — Application security. Many organizations 
make their own software for internal and 
external use, and application security is 
the process by which they manage the 
security of applications. This includes 
tooling across the DevOps process, 
such as application-security testing 
technology that enables on-demand and 
continuous scanning of applications for 
vulnerabilities.

 — Security operations. Many companies 

have created security operations centers 
that serve as the organization’s security 
nerve center. Tooling in this category 
allows for log collection, ingestion, 
normalization, and analysis, as well as 
automation and orchestration tooling that 
enables incident response.

 — Cloud security. As organizations pivot to 
the cloud, additional tooling is required 
to ensure that cloud environments (such 
as instances, buckets, and containers) 
adhere to enterprise security policies. A 
combination of policy management and 
technical tooling helps enable security 
controls across cloud, hybrid, and 
multicloud environments.

 — IoT/OT security. There is an emerging 

market for the security of nontraditional 
IT devices, including smart appliances, 
shop-floor robotics, turbines, and more. 
This category encompasses the security 
of programmable logic controllers and 
supervisory control and data acquisition 
devices. These devices typically prioritize 
availability for constant runtime and, in 
many cases, are legacy technologies 
(both hardware and software) that were 
not originally designed with cybersecurity 
attack vectors in mind.

 — Data protection. This tooling enables the 
data security and privacy of structured 
and unstructured data, including data-
at-rest, data-in-use, and data-in-motion. 
It encompasses encryption technology 
and technology that facilitates encrypted 
communications, as well as tooling 
that builds and leverages contextual 
understanding of data criticality in 
adopting dynamic security controls.

 — Endpoint security. This process 

provides day-to-day security for user 
hardware, such as laptops, mobile 
devices, and servers. This category 
includes antivirus software as well as 
more advanced technology that push 
enterprise security policies to endpoints 
and allow for real-time response to 
threats across the enterprise.

 — GRC and IRM solutions. Governance, 

risk management, and compliance (GRC) 
and integrated risk management (IRM) 
are typically functions of security risk 
organizations (also known as the “second 
line of defense”) that exist within more 
regulated industries. These tools enable 
the security risk and compliance process 
by managing and automating workflows 
of controls attestation, tracking 
enterprise risks for centralized reporting, 
and recording risk appetite and related 
decisions.

 — Network security. This tooling operates 
at the network layer to manage the 
security and authorization of network 
resources. It includes technologies 
such as firewalls, which analyze 
inbound packets, as well as virtual 
private networking (VPN), which allows 
for secure communications within an 
enterprise network.

 — Web security. This category 

encompasses tools that protect the 
consumption of web resources as more 
information and applications become 
web-facing. This includes content 
filtering in an employee’s browser as well 
as the network traffic management and 
security of web applications.

 — Email security and security awareness 
training. This tooling works with a 
corporate email system to filter out spam, 
identify phishing emails, and build user 
awareness of threats such as spear 
phishing that are often email-based.

 — MSSP and consulting. This category 
encompasses managed security 
service providers (MSSPs), which are 
third-party operations that manage 
security devices and processes. These 
services can include providing 24/7 
security monitoring, specialized skill 
sets such as advanced forensics for 
incident response, and outsourcing 
of commoditized services like identity 
provisioning and deprovisioning. In 
addition, these providers offer consulting 
services such as risk advising and 
incident response.

 — Implementation. This category covers 
the technical setup, configuration, and 
maintenance of the security stack.

In the future, the trend toward fewer large players could continue within each of the industry’s 
segments, fueled in part by established technology companies. For example, Microsoft has made 
notable acquisitions (including Two Hat, RiskIQ, and CloudKnox Security) and has promised to invest 
an additional $20 billion in cybersecurity through 2026.201 Google has pledged $10 billion to advance 
cybersecurity solutions over the same period.202 However, there are important factors that could 
keep the industry fragmented. The segments perform such different functions that combining them 
may not make practical sense. Instead, clients could continue to employ the layered approach and 
diversify risk by using multiple providers, calling on the cybersecurity companies whose offerings are 
best suited to their particular needs and risk profiles. Furthermore, geopolitical divisions could result 
in the shattering of a single global internet into parts, sometimes called the “splinternet,” which could 
also discourage industry-wide consolidation. 

Swing factors
 — As cybersecurity technologies continue to mature, how might new segments emerge, and which 

segments could become obsolete?

 — How might AI affect the cybersecurity industry? Would it chiefly benefit the attackers or the 

companies that combat them?

 — How would the emergence of widespread quantum computing, if it becomes a reality, affect 
cybersecurity? How quickly could the cybersecurity industry address security challenges 
brought on by quantum computing, such as the obsolescence of traditional encryption and the 
development of new pathways for attacks?

 — How many geographically distinct markets might the cybersecurity industry encompass, and how 

might geopolitical developments affect the structure and distribution of the global market?

 — How could evolving consumer awareness of digital safety and data security affect the growth 
of the cybersecurity industry, for example, if cybersecurity becomes more of a competitive 
advantage for consumer internet companies or if public pressure affects policies or regulations 
related to cybersecurity?

10. Batteries

Batteries are key to the energy transition. The battery industry’s value chain extends from mining 
and processing raw materials such as lithium and nickel, to cell manufacturing in gigafactories, to 
combining cells into rechargeable battery packs used for electric vehicles, stationary storage, and 
other applications. Batteries enable the electrification of transportation and storage of renewable 
energy by facilitating the distribution of electricity across space and time. Our analysis focuses 
primarily on batteries with lithium-ion chemistries, the most versatile and widely used today due to 
their high energy density and overall decline in cost. We also include sodium-ion batteries, which 
could scale as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries if lithium prices increase too sharply.

Batteries have come far technologically over the past 30 years. Costs have fallen from thousands 
of dollars per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in the early 2000s to less than $100 per kWh today, and energy 
density—a measure of the amount of energy a battery can store in proportion to its weight—nearly 
tripled in that period.203

Batteries are expected to improve further as they achieve higher energy density, accelerated 
charging, and improved life cycles, and reduce their environmental impact (for example, by using 
renewable electricity to power the manufacturing process or by sourcing more sustainable raw 
materials such as green nickel and cobalt). Some of this continuous improvement results in advances 
in battery technology such as the ability to enrich the anode with silicon compounds. Other advances 
come from new designs such as solid-state batteries or from new chemistries such as lithium-sulfur 
and vanadium redox. These could become direct substitutes for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries 
in specific applications (for example, to enable longer-duration storage). Older battery types with 
lower energy density, such as lead-acid, are excluded from consideration because the focus of 
battery innovation and market entry is increasingly shifting to novel and fast-growing segments.204

The following are the three main end-use segments in this market (Exhibit 1):

Electric vehicles (EVs): This segment includes passenger cars, commercial vehicles, two- and three-
wheelers, and off-highway, railway, marine, and aviation uses.205

Battery energy storage systems (BESS): Stationary energy storage systems, including those for 
utility-scale, commercial, industrial, and residential storage, make up this segment.206

Consumer electronics: This segment includes smartphones, laptops, wireless headphones, cameras, 
and other devices that rely on built-in batteries for power.207

the potential growth and 
dynamism of the batteries 
arena. It should not be read 
as a comprehensive account 
of the industry. To learn

associated industries, please

Because batteries are the enabling technology for the global energy transition, the industry is a 
promising potential arena of tomorrow. Decreasing costs, increasing lifetimes, improvements in 
energy density, faster charging, and advances in sustainability could expand the range of potential 
applications and solidify two large demand pools. The first is the electrification of the world’s fleet 
of one billion passenger vehicles. The second is the array of energy storage and power backup 
solutions that complement renewable energy generation by smoothing and time-shifting supply 
to more closely match the demand profile. Investors have already started to show confidence in 
these use cases: venture capital and private equity funds have poured about $42 billion into battery 
technology through more than 1,700 deals in the past ten years, with 75 percent of the investment in 
2020 and 2021. 

However, the industry is facing several headwinds, despite strong growth prospects. Global supply 
exceeds capacity, placing downward pressure on prices. This, combined with the high fixed costs 
required to build and ramp up a gigafactory, is leading to long-term profitability concerns, which also 
make financing more difficult. Strong secular demand trends toward electrification still point toward 
long-term growth, but growth could be tempered as margins shrink and financing becomes scarcer.

Growth
In our estimates, the battery industry produced 760 GWh of battery capacity in 2022, increasing 
to 12,800 by 2040 in the lower range of scenarios and to 13,700 by 2040 in the higher range of 
scenarios, a CAGR of just under 20 percent. The battery industry’s revenues increase from about 
$98 billion in 2022 to $810 billion by 2040 in the lower range of scenarios and to $1.1 trillion by 2040 
in the higher range of scenarios, a CAGR of 12 to 14 percent.

In all three segments—EVs, BESS, and consumer electronics—growth may be powered by both 
declining prices (and higher volumes) and increased future innovation. Batteries are still relatively 
expensive and make up 35 to 45 percent of the total cost of an EV, presenting a hurdle to the mass-
market deployment of the vehicles and storage systems. Yet prices are decreasing as production 
capabilities and capacity improve. Gigafactories are increasing their output and becoming more 
efficient.208 The global average battery plant size is expected to increase from 16 GWh in 2023 to 
28 GWh in 2030, which is likely to further improve production efficiency. Economies of scale could 
enable lower yield loss, faster production-line speed, and more efficient use of labor and energy.

Recent decreases in raw material prices and overcapacity in the cell supply have put more pressure 
on cell prices. And developments in new battery chemistries, for example moving from nickel and 
cobalt to iron and phosphate, could reduce the use of expensive raw materials. Growth could also 
be accelerated by a projected 2 to 3 percent annual increase in battery energy density, which would

battery market is based on the projection that average cell cost could decrease from $80–$130 per 
kWh in 2023 to $50–$75 per kWh in 2040.209 Prices could fall even lower if nascent technologies 
such as solid state batteries accelerate.

For now, the three segments of the battery market are positioned for varying levels of growth, 
depending on tailwinds.

EV batteries: This market is projected to propel future growth of batteries and to make up 84 to 
88 percent of demand in 2040. Annual production capacity in the EV batteries segment is expected 
to increase from 650 GWh in 2022 to between 11,000 and 12,000 GWh in 2040, a CAGR of about 
18 percent. Revenues in the EV battery segment are expected to rise from $85 billion in 2022 to between 
$700 billion and $950 billion in 2040, a CAGR of about 14 percent. Growth would stem from the projected 
evolution of the market for EVs as passenger and commercial vehicles are steadily electrified. 

In 2023, EVs made up 18 percent of global new passenger vehicle sales, with the numbers varying 
by geography: in China, more than 30 percent of new passenger vehicles were EVs, in the European 
Union 16 percent, and in the United States 8 percent.210 According to scenarios modeled by 
McKinsey’s Center for Future Mobility, EVs’ share of global passenger vehicle sales grows to between 
82 and 96 percent by 2040. In 2023, only 4 percent of commercial vehicles sold were battery electric 
vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). In the scenarios for 2040, the share of BEVs 
and FCEVs among light-duty trucks and light commercial vehicles would increase to between 30 and 
80 percent in regions of low penetration and to between 85 and 100 percent in regions of high 
penetration, with most of the vehicles likely to be BEVs. 

Four main factors are driving battery growth to the higher or lower end of that range: EV cost and 
quality, consumers’ willingness to pay a premium for sustainable vehicles and policy incentives, 
charging infrastructure, and the supply and distribution of electricity to the charging infrastructure. 
The EV market has seen some recent slowdowns, such as delayed electrification targets of some 
OEMs, and in 2024 experts revised EV sales growth projections downward for the first time. The 
market still displays strong long-term potential, though it is less accelerated than in the vehicles’ early 
years. We discuss adoption of EVs in greater detail in the compendium entry on electric vehicles.

BESS: BESS is the fastest-growing battery segment and may account for more than 10 percent of 
battery-cell demand in 2040, with global capacity deployment increasing from 50 GWh in 2022 to 
almost 100 GWh in 2023.211 That could increase to between 1,600 and 1,800 GWh in 2040, a CAGR 
of about 22 percent, according to analyses from McKinsey’s Battery Insights and Energy Storage 
Insights solutions. Revenues to manufacturers for sales of BESS could increase from $7 billion in 
2022 to between $100 billion and $140 billion in 2040, a CAGR of 16 to 18 percent.

This segment has the potential to enable the renewable energy transition, with growth in both front-
of-the-meter installations and behind-the-meter installations.212 Front-of-the-meter installations—
the utility-scale BESS systems installed on the electric grid to store and dispense energy—account 
for the majority, about 65 percent, of the BESS segment.213 Growth in utility-scale BESS is driven 
by both the expansion of renewable energy generation from wind and solar and the development of 
other energy storage technologies. Greater reliance on renewable energy requires energy storage 
that can balance out the natural intraday variability in wind and solar energy generation.214 Utility-
scale BESS is growing rapidly as utilities race to find a storage solution for the growing share of 
variable energy production. In 2023, variable renewables like solar and wind accounted for 13 percent 
of global electricity generation, nearly double the 7 percent share in 2018. By 2028, that share could 
rise to 25 percent.215 Other than storage capacity, BESS also provides ancillary services to support 
the grid such as frequency regulation, further driving growth.216

In addition to intraday storage, renewable grids also may require large amounts of long-duration 
energy storage (LDES) to meet interday or even seasonal fluctuations in energy supply and demand. 
Several technologies are being explored, from thermal storage and compressed air storage 
to hydrogen and power-to-gas.217 If battery prices continue to drop as LDES develop toward

technological maturity and commercialization, BESS could become a cost-competitive solution for 
LDES use cases as well.

Behind-the-meter installations—systems installed at residential, commercial, or industrial locations 
for generation, consumption, and storage—account for the remaining 35 percent of the BESS 
segment. Although they are a smaller part of the segment, behind-the-meter installations have 
the potential for growth, alongside distributed power generation resources such as solar panels in 
homes or office buildings. Behind-the-meter systems can store excess electricity generation during 
the daytime and help moderate energy costs by reducing peak demand spikes. They can also buy 
electricity from the grid when prices are low and sell it when prices are high. Residential energy 
storage (namely, smart homes to achieve energy self-sufficiency and optimize self-consumption) also 
show growth potential. Technological advances that enhance price, energy density, safety, and ease 
of installation will likely help push further adoption by businesses and consumers.

Consumer electronics: This market may make up less than 2 percent of battery demand in 2040, 
rising from 50 GWh in 2022 to about 170 GWh in 2040, a CAGR of about 7 percent. This segment’s 
revenues could increase from $6 billion in 2022 to about $14 billion in 2040, a CAGR of 5 percent, 
driven by continued growth in portable consumer devices. The consumer electronics industry has 
been maturing, and incremental advances have slowed. As a result, consumer demand has begun 
to shift from new to refurbished products that are more affordable and comparable in capabilities. 
Without further innovation and change, it is likely that demand for consumer electronics would grow 
at a modest and steady pace, affecting the demand for built-in batteries. That growth in consumer 
electronics—and the associated batteries—could be driven by the expanding middle class in 
developing countries, such as Brazil, Egypt, India, and Indonesia.218

Dynamism
Today’s battery-manufacturing landscape has a few large players and is largely based in Asia. 
This stems from a first-mover advantage that allowed top players to quickly develop economies of 
scale and efficient supply chains. As a result, in 2021, the top four cell manufacturers controlled 
upward of 60 percent of the battery production market for EVs.219 Japanese and South Korean cell 
manufacturers tend to be established conglomerates with decades of experience, while Chinese 
manufacturers started producing consumer batteries and expanding into EVs in the 1990s. Battery 
producers are still ramping up in Europe and North America.220

The battery industry has high barriers to entry given the large capital requirements to build 
gigafactories and the large operational challenges to ramp up gigafactories. These constraints, 
together with increasing material cost and tightening global competition, mean thinning margins 
that could continue to favor the large incumbent global cell manufacturers. For example, lithium-ion 
batteries currently face pricing pressures as EV sales growth has not kept up with the rising global 
production and temporary overcapacities exist. In times of tightening margins, smaller manufacturers 
may have difficulties competing against larger competitors’ economies of scale, operational 
advantages, and ability to take new contracts (and maximize capacity utilization) at a lower price 
without sacrificing overall financial performance. While prices naturally peak and trough depending 
on the market’s supply and demand, these swings will likely continue to favor industry leaders that are 
able to weather market lulls.

Moreover, the market may continue to favor scale because the need for technology know-how 
and supply-chain infrastructure stability could lead to a high-cost ticket to play that discourages 
would-be entrants and existing players that are unable to achieve sufficient scale. Higher barriers to 
entry—such as the need for aggressive cost reductions in the manufacturing and procurement of raw 
materials—could benefit the players with the most scale. This could set the stage for escalation of 
capital expenditures as players seek to generate greater scale to compete under tight margins. Large

players have significant cash flow to deploy robust research teams to develop battery technology, 
making it harder for smaller players to compete. In addition, supply-chain challenges give incumbents 
a head start. Players would likely need to have the know-how to design batteries and optimize 
manufacturing. To achieve scale and win customers, producers could need to secure machinery 
capacity, develop long-term supply contracts, and improve product sustainability.

Supply-side factors could also shift global market share from the large Asian players to scaled 
competitors outside Asia. China has faced overcapacity issues; for example, gigafactory average 
utilization rates dropped below 45 percent in the first quarter of 2023. A utilization rate of 75 to 85 
percent is the typical benchmark for profitability.221 This is the result of escalatory competition from 
top players that overinvested in production capacity to try to capture future demand. Trade policy is 
another important factor shifting market shares in the battery arena, as governments outside Asia 
increasingly prioritize local battery manufacturers with policy incentives both for cell makers and EV 
customers, as well as through import tariffs on foreign batteries. For example, the 2021 US Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law provided a $3.5 billion boost to domestic battery production.222

And there are opportunities for new entrants. Advances in technology and specialization in new 
use cases could allow new entrants to compete against the incumbent battery manufacturers, 
which must continually invest in R&D to maintain an edge. These new players could evolve existing 
technologies, such as semi-solid-state lithium-ion batteries, or they could develop batteries with 
longer durations than traditional ones. It’s not possible to predict whether the new technologies 
currently under development—such as longer-shelf-duration, higher-density, lower-cost, and fit-
for-purpose designs in EV power trains—will be able to reach scale or disrupt the sector. Moreover, 
new entrants would need to commercialize new innovations faster than existing players to capture 
the benefits of this higher-risk technology development. But if these new breakthroughs come 
from players other than incumbents, or if incumbents fall behind on the pace of research, space to 
compete would open for new entrants with more efficient or lower-cost batteries. These market shifts 
could tip the scale in favor of certain chemistries and benefit players that meet market needs.

Swing factors
 — How will consumer demand and changes in government regulation, including climate-related 

policies, affect the pace of growth in the battery industry?

 — Will batteries be the technology of choice for utility-level energy storage, and how much will that 

use case grow as countries decarbonize?

 — How will a preference for local battery production stemming from geopolitical tensions affect 

future supply-chain resilience?

 — How might newer battery technologies, such as sodium-ion and lithium-sulfur, improve energy 

density, reduce production costs, and ultimately affect industry dynamics, such as the growth rate 
by battery segment and the number of new entrants by battery technology?

 — How will the sourcing and processing of raw materials change as the industry shifts toward 

batteries with smaller environmental footprints?

 — What is the relationship between prices and the rate of adoption of battery technologies? How 
would events along the supply chain, for example a spike in the price of a raw material such as 
lithium or nickel, affect pricing or the adoption rate?

 — How will the shift from a linear to a circular industry (use and dispose versus repair, reuse, and 

recycle) affect the battery market?

 — What are the potential constraints for battery growth (for example, the ability to sustainably 

increase supply of critical minerals for lithium-ion batteries)?

11. Modular construction

With a value of $13 trillion, construction is one of the largest industries in the global economy. 
However, despite technological improvements by individual companies, labor productivity growth 
in the industry has lagged for decades. Global construction productivity increased only 10 percent 
(less than 1 percent annually) between 2000 and 2022, while productivity for the overall economy 
increased 50 percent (2 percent annually) and the manufacturing sector’s productivity rose 
90 percent (3 percent annually).223 Construction productivity actually declined 8 percent from  
2020 to 2022. 

The need for transformation is urgent for two reasons. First, there is a global housing shortage and 
affordability crisis, especially in populous cities such as Mexico City, Mumbai, New York, and São 
Paulo that account for more than 20 percent of the world’s GDP.224 The UN Special Rapporteur on 
the Right to Adequate Housing estimated that about 1.6 billion people lacked adequate housing 
and 3 billion people could be affected by 2030 due to declining mortality rates, increasing global 
population, and limited affordable housing options.225 Second, there is a critical skilled labor gap in 
the construction industry, especially in the United States. According to one estimate, for every new 
hire in the American construction industry, there may be 20 new job openings for critical roles such 
as laborer, electrician, and welder.226 An additional factor, though not as widely acknowledged, is 
that the buildings and construction sector accounts for 37 percent of global emissions and faces 
increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint.227

Industrialized modular construction has the potential to change the game in the massive global 
construction industry—which had a market for new builds worth roughly $8 trillion in 2022—by 
improving construction productivity. In contrast to the long-held practice of in situ assembly of 
raw materials such as cement and timber, modular construction entails building standardized, 
prefabricated 2D or 3D modules at an off-site factory. The modules are then assembled into 
buildings or infrastructure on the construction site. Two-dimensional modules are typically single-
discipline units such as precast frames and panels, while 3D modules are volumetric, comprehensive 
structures. In this report, we focus on 3D modules, which are better suited to achieve the technique’s 
productivity potential. 

Modular techniques can reduce the time needed for the planning, design, and on-site installation 
phases of construction. These phases can be run in parallel, while traditional construction requires 
construction phases to proceed sequentially (exhibit).228 Modular construction requires fewer 
workers than traditional building projects, an attractive prospect in high-labor-cost countries such  
as Japan, the Nordics, and Singapore.

the potential growth and 
dynamism of the modular 
construction arena. It 
should not be read as a 
comprehensive account of the 
industry. To learn more about

However, modular construction has yet to reach scale globally. We estimate that roughly 2 percent 
of the $8 trillion market for new builds in 2022 used the technique. In North America, the growth 
of modular construction has been slower than projected, at a 4 percent CAGR from 2018 to 2022, 
compared with forecasts of 6 to 12 percent. The slower growth can be attributed to inadequate 
ecosystem partnerships, including with installation contractors, developers, and financers. Common 
challenges encountered by modular firms include overdesign, inefficiencies in installation, unsteady 
manufacturing pipelines, and insufficient capital, all of which prevent companies from realizing their 
promised time and cost savings.229 By overcoming these challenges, modular construction could 
completely transform the global construction industry with a step change in productivity. Because of 
this potential, modular construction could become an arena of the future.

But there are trade-offs. First, modular construction factories need stable demand over long periods 
to keep busy and running. Second, while module repeatability and ease of assembly reduce on-site

complexity and the need for manual labor, the technique also creates greater logistical complications 
and requires planning for standardization across various project types, from affordable housing to 
single-family homes.

Growth
Experts forecast that the modular construction industry could expand substantially over the next 
ten to 15 years, estimating an annual growth rate of between 6 and 10 percent. Growth could be 
driven by the increasing global penetration of the process, from about 2 percent of new build in 
2023 to a projected 5 to 9 percent in 2040.230 In our modeled scenarios, the modular construction 
market’s revenues could grow from $180 billion in 2022 to $540 billion by 2040 in the lower range 
of scenarios, a CAGR of 6 percent. In the higher range, market size could reach $1.1 trillion by 2040, 
a CAGR of 10 percent, assuming growth continues in regions with higher penetration and less 
advanced modular markets catch up.231

To estimate the growth of the modular construction market, we considered the end-to-end value 
of an entire project, not just the value added during off-site construction. That is because modular 
firms typically act as primary designers. However, there are other business models, such as modular 
manufacturing firms that supply premade units but do not install them. This report disregards single-
discipline units, such as precast frames and panels, and concentrates instead on volumetric and 
comprehensive structures.

Three critical factors contribute to the high and low ranges of estimates of where the modular 
construction industry will be in 2040.

Partnering across the value chain: In the higher range of scenarios, modular companies coordinate 
effectively in three major ways. First, they are integrated into project design with developers 
and architects. This ensures that project specifications are ideal for a modular system. Next, the 
companies collaborate effectively with suppliers and manufacturers to ensure efficient production. 
Last, modular players integrate with and lead on-site contractors and logistics providers to ensure 
that each component is assembled in the correct sequence. Modular’s potential for parallel execution 
of design as well as off-site and on-site manufacturing can be realized only when those processes 
are carefully sequenced. Delays can cascade if manufacturing rework, late deliveries, or improper 
assembly diminishes the cost and time savings achieved by a modular project compared with 
traditional methods. In the lower range of scenarios, these coordination challenges remain an issue in 
many countries.

Project selection: In the higher range of scenarios, developers source modules for projects that have 
repeatable units, limited customization, and consistent demand. This does not mean that all modular 
structures need to look the same. There can be great variation in the aesthetics of modular buildings 
and in the benefits that can be achieved if there is standardization in the technical interfaces and 
connections. However, bespoke structures such as corporate campuses that need customized 
spaces are generally less well suited to capturing the benefits. By contrast, multifamily housing 
(especially affordable housing) and dormitories are better able to gain from modular construction. 
Growth in the sector could also depend on whether players can establish partnerships with 
developers and contractors that ensure a consistent flow of projects, because modular firms rely 
on constant demand to scale up off-site production factories, given the high fixed capital expenses 
involved. In the lower range of estimates, modular companies have difficulty finding projects that can 
achieve the scale to maximize the productivity benefits.

On-site execution: The higher range of scenarios assumes that modular companies successfully 
leverage experienced construction talent to manage on-site execution. Modular firms with this 
kind of talent on their teams have an advantage. By investing heavily in tech talent to design and by

innovating on the right product, modular firms could prioritize project execution talent that can train 
on-site crews and manage deadlines. The labor force on construction sites is accustomed to working 
with wood and cement. Successful modular firms are those that integrate traditional construction 
expertise and experience with technical product development. In the lower range of scenarios, these 
execution challenges remain widespread.

Dynamism
The construction industry is both fragmented and localized, reflecting the many stakeholders and 
subcontractors involved in any project and the specific construction codes that can vary by location. 
In the United States, public records list more than 440,000 homebuilder businesses. The largest 
of these, D.R. Horton, employs 14,000 people and accounts for roughly 10 percent of the market 
for new homes; the average construction company employs fewer than ten people, and the average 
construction project involves more than 100 different suppliers and subcontractors.232

By contrast, as noted above, modular companies can only realize their full potential at scale, given 
the high fixed costs of product development and a manufacturing base. Achieving this scale will 
likely require forming mutually beneficial partnerships with contractors, developers, and other 
stakeholders in the value chain. Better execution and efficient collaboration could create a cycle of 
continuous improvement that ultimately could transform the industry.

Even though the industry’s growth potential favors players that achieve scale, the forces that 
encourage fragmentation in the overall construction market limit the number of large players. 
Different projects have different engineering requirements, equipment and building material needs, 
and production techniques. As a result, different players specialize in different types of projects or 
parts of the construction value chain. To get the right materials to the right place at the right time, 
developers require knowledge of the specific site, and they must be familiar with local regulations and 
codes as well as local suppliers and logistics. If modular construction becomes a larger portion of the 
global construction industry, these forces will shape the industry’s transformation.

Swing factors
 — Despite the continued global housing shortage and skilled construction labor gaps, have high-
profile failures of modular construction firms dampened financiers’ willingness to invest in the 
industry? Are national governments likely to intervene to spur the market?

12. Streaming video

The streaming video industry delivers long-form video entertainment over the internet. The global 
number of households that used these services rose from 320 million in 2017 to 670 million in 
2022.233 By 2040, the number could easily exceed one billion. Over the past decade, escalating 
spending on content and technology gave rise to a phenomenon known as the streaming wars, as 
companies vied for consumers’ attention and businesses’ advertising. More recently, companies have 
faced increased pressure to achieve profitability, leading to reduced spending and a shift toward 
the more collaborative business model of content bundling. Although volume growth has moderated 
in the past few years, the streaming video market still has growth potential. The global number of 
households around the world with broadband internet reached 1.5 billion in 2023, after expanding at 
an 8 percent CAGR starting in 2013.234

Media and tech players are now trying to determine which content and platforms will attract 
consumers—whether on smartphones, smart TVs, or dongles that enable streaming on TVs—and 
how to split revenues. Escalation in this large and growing market explains why streaming video is 
poised to become an arena of tomorrow. 

Growth 
The potential drivers of outsize growth in streaming video include increasing adoption of streaming 
technology worldwide, higher spending on streaming services, and more advertising placements 
on and revenues from streaming platforms. These growth drivers manifest across the industry’s 
three revenue sources: subscriptions; transactions, such as pay-per-view purchases; and ads, such 
as YouTube’s spots in its free content. As competition and the cost of content creation increase, 
streaming companies are moving toward generating revenues from more than one of those sources. 

Currently, there are five main types of companies. The first type is those constructed entirely around 
streaming video, such as Netflix. Second are traditional entertainment studios and media and 
distribution companies such as Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery that have moved into the streaming 
market by expanding their businesses through forward integration. These players realize most of 
their profits by offering content on pay TV. Third are big tech companies that have built streaming 
businesses mainly to enhance their horizontal franchises, as Amazon did with Amazon Prime Video 
and Apple did with Apple TV. Fourth are video-sharing platforms such as YouTube that offer both 
short and longer-form content, paid for by subscriptions and ads. While social media companies have 
video-sharing features, they have been excluded from this analysis, because short-form content 
tends to serve a different purpose and audience than longer-form videos. YouTube and its $29 billion 
of ad revenues in 2022 are included, even though the company has a social media component. Lastly, 
there are hardware aggregators, such as Samsung, LG, and Roku which make streaming devices or 
smart TVs and aggregate content from multiple providers. For example, Roku, whose user base is 
larger than the combined audiences of the six largest pay-TV providers, features a set of exclusive 
free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels.235 These aggregators also generate revenues from 
advertising, a factor we included in our calculations. (Hardware sales are excluded from our estimates.) 

In our estimates, the industry’s revenues grow from $160 billion in 2022 to $510 billion in 2040 in the 
lower range of scenarios and to $1 trillion in 2040 in the higher range, a CAGR of 6 to 11 percent.236 A 
significant portion of those revenues would result from an increase in streaming video’s share of the 
overall video entertainment market. In 2022, streaming video captured only 24 percent of the overall 
revenues in video entertainment (exhibit). In the middle range of scenarios, that share increases to 
43 percent by 2040.

First, the number of global households that stream video grows from 670 million in 2022 to between 
1.0 billion and 1.4 billion by 2040, increasing household penetration from 29 percent to between  
34 and 48 percent. The upper range of scenarios assumes that developing markets quickly adopt the 
technology. The lower range of scenarios assumes that developing markets shift slowly to streaming.

Second, spending on subscriptions and transactions by each household with at least one paid 
streaming service grows from a global average of $10 a month in 2022 to $20 to $40 a month in 
2040.237 The upper range of our scenarios assumes that developed markets see rapid growth in 
both the number of households with streaming subscriptions and spending on subscriptions. This 
might imply not new outlays on entertainment but rather a shift from cable to streaming services. The 
higher spending by consumers could also include bundled subscription services, such as Disney’s 
bundle of Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+. 

Streaming companies are starting to invest heavily in sports. For instance, Disney+, NBC/Peacock, 
and Amazon/ESPN signed a $76 billion, 11-year contract with the NBA for exclusive broadcasting 
rights, and Amazon has acquired exclusive rights to live streaming of the United Kingdom’s 
Champions League soccer matches.238

Subscription growth is not unlimited, however. In a 2023 survey, up to 62 percent of US consumers 
reported that they were overwhelmed by the number of video services.239 The lower range of 
our scenarios assumes that the number of new streaming households and their spending on 
subscriptions are relatively more constrained. 

Third, advertising revenues grow at a CAGR of 8 to 9 percent from 2022 to 2040, representing 
up to half of the streaming video industry’s overall revenues. Ad-supported streaming video has 
grown rapidly: in the United States, it went from 60 million viewers in 2018 to 164 million viewers 
in 2023, nearly half of the population.240 Ad-supported streaming video includes both FAST 
and ad-supported subscription services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video’s ad-supported 
tiers. Advertising revenues might continue to increase as ad-supported streaming video 
viewership increases. The supply of advertising spots in streaming video would also increase 
as more companies turn to ads for revenue growth, especially in developed markets. However, 
the ad-supported streaming offerings, which are often free, could pull some viewers away from 
subscription- and transaction-based streaming video. Our scenarios assume a varying pace of 
growth for streaming video’s share of digital advertising.

Dynamism
The five main types of companies in the streaming video industry—streaming video–first players, 
entertainment studios, big tech companies, video-sharing platforms, and hardware aggregators—
currently have just a few large players. In 2023, Netflix took in 27 percent of global subscription 
revenues, and the next four largest services (Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube) 
accounted for 27 percent combined. Increased verticalization and regulatory decisions could further 
limit the number of key players. However, the industry may continue to see new entrants, including 
well-capitalized major media institutions, regional companies, and smaller fragmented creators.

Streaming players have overlapping channels where they deliver their content. For instance, they 
compete against one another with long-form content streamed on both TV and mobile phones, a 
growing market that accounts for as much as 16 percent of streaming in the United States.241 The 
number of hours global consumers spend taking in media is projected to increase at a 1 percent 
CAGR from 2022 to 2027, driven primarily by a 7 percent CAGR in digital media usage, led by mobile 
video and games.

Some of the lines separating products have blurred. Key streaming video players, such as Apple, 
Amazon, and YouTube, are not traditionally associated with media entertainment and participate in 
other parts of the attention economy. Also, video—particularly short-form video—is widely delivered 
by social media companies such as TikTok and Instagram (part of Meta). For example, in 2024, the 
number of subscribers to the user-generated content (UGC) streamed by the online personality 
MrBeast surpassed Netflix’s global subscriber base.242 The current market structure was a result 
of streaming companies’ efforts to pursue scale, which provides benefits: while fixed costs (mainly 
content production and acquisition budgets) are high and rising, the marginal cost of serving 
additional customers is relatively low. For example, Netflix achieved positive cash flow only when it 
reached 220 million global subscribers.243

The virtuous cycle of benefits that scale brings was observable in the late 2010s, when the 
companies with the biggest budgets invested in the most content to attract customers, and the 
companies with the most customers invested more in content. This cycle led to a market structure 
with a few large players. Nine of the major entertainment studios and media companies in the 
industry in 2017 had merged by 2022, creating six bigger companies, while all pursuing scale. 
Companies have moved toward both creating content and distributing it, as Netflix, Amazon, and 
Apple are doing. Meanwhile, the large studios and media companies have built platforms to distribute 
their content.

The number of new players has decreased for most of the past decade, while mergers have increased 
as companies that couldn’t match the velocity of investment or build better products were unable to 
compete and exited the market (an illustration of the escalatory competition described in chapter 2). 

More recently, the favorable economics of collaboration has lowered barriers, and companies now 
see working together as an option for scaling. In addition, companies face stronger pressures for 
higher profitability (Netflix introduced advertising in 2022).244 This has moved the market toward 
greater collaboration, which allows players to license content, bundle streaming services, or rebundle 
streaming with cable services to save on content creation.

On the other hand, several developments could cause more fragmentation. Regulators could proceed 
with antitrust challenges to prevent M&A among existing players, or more companies from other 
industries might enter the fray. Additionally, the advent of generative AI radically lowers the barriers 
to creating content. It has the potential to reshape the market, including making it easier to produce 
higher-quality UGC. Companies including Netflix are spending heavily on AI and machine learning to 
help optimize their production, advertising, and mix of channels and shows.245

In addition, some viewers are already watching video-game competitions (commonly referred to as 
eSports), and video-game companies could use their capabilities to produce video entertainment 
beyond games. Disney has invested $1.5 billion in an equity stake in Epic Games to form a large-scale 
entertainment and gaming partnership.246

Swing factors
 — How will the industry cover content production costs, and which business models (subscription 

based or advertising revenue based) will succeed?

 — How will UGC evolve? To what extent will it replace traditional premium video? Will this evolution 
vary between short- and long-form content, and how will streaming platforms adapt? How will 
the lines separating these various forms of media blur? How will ecosystem players with an array 
of monetization options, such as Amazon and Apple, evolve and become different from pure-play 
companies such as Netflix? 

 — How will streaming advertising evolve? What level of adoption will advertiser-supported  

offerings receive?

 — What will the future bundle look like? Could players bundle with other stand-alone platforms, 

which could enhance users’ value proposition? Additionally, how will the shift from cable bundles 
to unbundled or bundled streaming affect industry dynamics? Who will be in control: cable 
companies, third-party device makers, tech giants, or entertainment partnerships?

13. Video games

The number of video-game players worldwide increased from 1.9 billion in 2018 to 2.6 billion in 
2023. Video games compete for consumers’ time in a broader attention economy that offers leisure 
activities ranging from shopping to social media to streaming video (see the entries for digital 
advertising and streaming video in this compendium). People born between 1995 and 2010 spend 
more time playing games than they do watching TV.247 In 2017, consumers spent only 40 minutes a 
week on mobile games. By 2022, they were playing almost 100 minutes a week. That could increase 
to 160 minutes a week by 2027. By 2030, roughly 40 percent of the global population could be video-
game players.

Two major trends suggest that the industry could become an arena. First, there has been a surge in 
game playing on mobile phones. The launch of the iPhone in 2007 and of Apple’s App Store in 2008 
fundamentally changed the landscape and business model for mobile gaming. In 2017, there were 
an estimated 1.2 billion mobile gamers. By 2022, there were 1.6 billion. In addition, the mobile gaming 
market is still relatively young and has considerable potential for expansion.

Second, free-to-play games have been extraordinarily successful on consoles, PCs, and mobile 
phones, generating revenue from large bases of users who make small but frequent in-game 
purchases. Spending on games grew from $52 billion in 2017 to $75 billion in 2022, a CAGR of 
8 percent. Fortnite, one of the most popular free-to-play games, has 500 million players and 
generates billions of dollars in revenues for its publisher, Epic Games.248

Spending on developing console and PC games has also increased sharply. In 2018, the offerings 
with the highest budgets and production values, known as AAA games, cost between $50 million and 
$150 million to produce. By 2023, AAA games with planned releases in 2024 and 2025 had budgets 
of $200 million or more.249 By contrast, the average production budget for the 150 most expensive 
movies from 2016 to 2023 was $180 million.250

The video-game industry has recently faced challenges. During the pandemic, limited entertainment 
options led to increased consumer spending on games, but projections that revenue growth would be 
sustained after the pandemic proved overoptimistic. The global market has been stagnating due to a 
reduction in the number of games, challenges in monetization per gamer, recent regulatory changes, 
and cooling investor interest. Furthermore, cross-platform play, growth in emerging markets, and 
growth in user-generated content (UGC) and indie titles have challenged the model that worked so 
well in the high-growth pandemic years. Industry players also face rising competition from vertically 
integrated competitors, well-capitalized entrants, and global competitors. Consumer spending fell to 
$57 billion in 2022, near prepandemic levels.251

Despite these recent setbacks, the long-term trends surrounding video games are likely to persist. 
These tailwinds do not imply uninterrupted growth but indicate that if the industry can overcome its 
current challenges, it could capitalize on these trends to become an arena. 

Growth
Outsize growth in video games could result from increases in the number of game players—
particularly as the number of connected middle-class consumers in emerging markets increases—
along with growing advertising revenues and greater spending per gamer as time spent playing 
increases. Top-performing industry players increase their numbers of users by expanding cross-
platform capabilities, investing in high-growth markets, enhancing their platforms, and maintaining

product quality. To sustain profitability, they also take advantage of alternative monetization methods 
and ad strategies, and they use generative AI (gen AI) technology to improve productivity and lower 
costs, particularly in game production.

Video games’ revenues of $230 billion in 2022 accounted for 35 percent of the total for the overall 
video entertainment industry, behind traditional video (cable and broadcast TV and movies in 
theaters) at 41 percent. Video games’ share could increase to 44 percent by 2040, the largest in  
the industry, outstripping streaming video as well as traditional video (Exhibit 1).

In our estimates, the video-game industry’s revenues grow to $550 billion in 2040 in a lower-range 
scenario and to $910 billion in 2040 in an upper-range scenario, implying a CAGR of 5 to 8 percent.252 
The calculation of revenues excludes consumer spending on peripheral devices, hardware with 
different uses (such as phones and laptops), community platforms and streaming, and e-sports 
(organized video-game competitions).

The 2040 estimates reflect the video-game industry’s three revenue segments: consumer spending 
on games, advertising revenue, and sale of consoles.

Consumer spending on games. This segment includes in-store and digital sales, in-game purchases 
(also known as microtransactions), and subscriptions to game services, such as Xbox Game Pass and 
EA Play. It generated about 60 percent of the industry’s revenues in 2022. 

Developments affecting the size of the gaming population and the amount spent per player will 
determine future spending. To begin with, gamers are becoming more diverse across platforms, 
a trend that increases their overall number. This effect is strongest in mobile games, which are 
attracting more women and older players: in 2022, an estimated 55 percent of mobile gamers in 
the United States were women, and almost 60 percent of adults aged 35 to 54 played at least  
once a week.253 Even those who spent the most time playing PC or console games increased 
their time spent on mobile gaming. This segment is also growing rapidly in developing economies, 
especially in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, as internet and smartphone 
penetration increases. 

Expansion of the game-playing population also correlates with the growth of the middle class in 
developing countries, a group that will have greater access to broadband internet, electronic devices 
capable of running games, and disposable income to spend on both. The number of players has 
grown especially quickly in Asia, and other developing regions could follow suit. Asia was home to 
an estimated 1.5 billion gamers in 2022, and that could grow to 2.7 billion by 2040, a CAGR of about 
4 percent, with Southeast Asia showing the most rapid growth. The number of gamers in the Middle 
East and North Africa is also rising rapidly. Developed economies may experience slower but stable 
growth, though a new wave of expansion in the number of gamers is still possible if innovations, such 
as cloud gaming or augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) gaming, become more widespread. 

The introduction of UGC, which effectively transforms game players into developers and transforms 
developers into publishing channels, is also contributing to the increase in players.254 For example, 
Roblox users can create games and experiences on its platform and can play games made by other 
users. By the end of 2023, Roblox had nearly 70 million daily active users, including more than half of 
Americans under 16.255 And Fortnite’s UGC mode, Fortnite Creative, now has more players than the 
game’s more traditional Battle Royale modes.256

Cloud gaming could also increase the amount of time and money that players spend on gaming. 
Processing of these games takes place in the cloud, and the resulting video can be streamed to any 
device with hardware and an internet connection that is strong enough to render the images. That 
lowers the barrier to entry for consumers, gives users access to a wider library of games through 
subscriptions, sidesteps the need to wait for large downloads, lowers hardware costs, and allows 
users to play PC-quality games on their phones or other devices.

Gen AI has also become increasingly important in game development. It can be used to generate 
game content, including voices, dialogue, and personalities for characters. Game developers also 
have increasingly partnered with the owners of the intellectual property (IP) of popular franchises, 
from movies to manga, which attract large fan bases. In 2023, 43 percent of the top 200 games in 
the United States were IP-based. The share was 66 percent in Japan.257 IP-based collaborations 
have boosted the number of daily active users of games by 11 percent within the first seven days  
of launch.258

The upper range of revenue scenarios assumes stronger effects on the total number of players based 
on those factors, and the lower range assumes weaker ones.

These scenarios are also based on assumptions about spending per player. Free-to-play mobile 
games with in-app purchases can generate more than twice the revenues of mobile games that only 
require a single initial purchase. This higher scenario assumes that free-to-play formats become even 
more popular and increase spending per player. It also assumes that subscription models continue

to spread, which would spur consumer spending. Free-to-play and subscription games are growing 
quickly, but the industry’s revenues would be closer to the lower-range scenario if that growth slows.

In addition, the advent of AR/VR could make games even more interactive. If they are widely adopted, 
they could expand the industry, but their high prices could be a barrier to consumers. Indeed, the 
technology has already gone through several cycles of hype and bust.

While we do not include e-sports (video games played competitively for spectators) in our sizing of 
this industry, they are an important factor boosting the popularity of gaming. The market’s revenues 
are projected to increase from $1.2 billion in 2017 to $5.7 billion by 2028, a CAGR of 15 percent. 
E-sports betting would contribute more than half of projected overall revenues in that period.259 
In 2024, there will be an estimated 286 million e-sports enthusiasts, with an additional 292 million 
occasional viewers, up from 194 million and 200 million, respectively, in 2019.260

Advertising revenue. Advertising in games generated about 30 percent of the industry’s revenues in 
2022. Estimates of future growth assumed conservatively that these revenues would increase at the 
same rate as advertising revenues in other digital media. 

But revenues could grow more quickly than estimated for several reasons. For one, developers are 
finding more opportunities for revenues from placing ads in games. For another, games played on 
mobile phones are the fastest-growing segment, and they are the most likely to use ads: advertising 
revenues from mobile games climbed at a 30 percent CAGR from 2017 to 2022. By 2027, advertising 
revenues from mobile games could reach $140 billion, exceeding revenues from paid applications 
($110 billion) and in-app purchases ($2 billion).

Games remain a far smaller and newer market for ads than, for example, internet search or TV, so 
digital advertising has ample room to grow. Ad placements could start to emerge in PC or console 
games, not just in mobile games. 

Sales of consoles. Sales of consoles such as Nintendo’s Switch and Microsoft’s Xbox generated 
just 7 percent of the video-game industry’s revenues in 2022, a share that could shrink over time. 
The next generation of consoles is expected to come out in 2029 and could produce a spike in sales 
followed by a steep drop. Cloud gaming may even make consoles obsolete for the next generation 
by removing the need for a dedicated local gaming machine. The upper range of scenarios assumes 
that consoles will maintain their relevance. The lower range of scenarios assumes that players shift to 
cloud gaming and games on mobile phones, lowering demand for next-generation consoles.

Dynamism
The video-game industry has a few large players; its five biggest companies accounted for about 40 
percent of industry revenues in 2022.261 A sign that the industry may be heading toward even fewer 
players is that the number of M&A deals surpassed the number of new companies in 2022 for the 
first time in at least a decade (Exhibit 2).262 The following year, Microsoft made the largest deal in 
its history with the purchase of Activision Blizzard.263 But games for dedicated consoles, PCs, and 
mobile phones, a fast-growing and currently highly fragmented market, are likely to show different 
kinds of dynamism.

Recently, a few large publishers in the console-games industry used acquisitions of game developers 
to scale. Vertical integration of the industry also increased as console manufacturers (particularly 
Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft) acquired game developers and publishers to produce exclusive 
content and expand the value of their ecosystems. Vertical integration also allowed console makers 
to expand margins, from 5 to 6 percent in the console business and from 25 to 35 percent in game 
publishing. The trend toward a few large players could continue if new technologies such as virtual 
reality increase costs further. However, gen AI could pose a threat to incumbent game developers by 
making it easier for newcomers to create sophisticated games. 

A similar trend toward narrowing the field could affect AAA PC games, whose increasing budgets and 
complexity have also benefited big developers. Indeed, the biggest developers, such as Electronic 
Arts, produce AAA games for both consoles and PCs. Higher costs may prompt companies to 
reassess the growth potential of those games, including by examining average user engagement 
and purchases. This could reinforce movement toward a few players in this high-end segment of the 
industry, potentially benefiting big developers equipped to handle the cost and complexity. But the 
market for other PC games is likely to remain more fragmented because developing them is much 
easier, cheaper, and more open than developing console games, a process that is tightly controlled by 
the console company.264

Mobile gaming may grow faster than console and PC games, and thus exhibit more dynamism. Mobile 
games already earn more revenues than console games, increasing dynamism across the entire 
arena, and the enormous mobile-phone market gives this segment ample room to expand, with even 
faster growth that could raise market share to more than 80 percent by 2040.

The market for games played on mobile phones is currently highly fragmented, but it is showing 
some indications of consolidation. Small developers can build games for platforms such as iOS and 
Android, grow rapidly, and try to take market share from incumbents. Movement among the large 
players has already begun; examples include the acquisition of mobile-first developer Zynga by 
Take-Two and the purchase of King by Activision Blizzard.265 In addition, there has been a substantial 
increase in M&A by mobile native publishers (examples include Playtika’s $1.2 billion M&A budget 
and Stillfront’s acquisition of studios to generate economies of scale). While the free-to-play, 
microtransaction-based business model has been growing—and with it the quality and quantity 
of free-to-play games—the cost of acquiring paying users is also increasing.266 That could lead 
developers that are unable to acquire paying customers to be absorbed by more successful  
gaming companies.

Swing factors
 — Could regional differences lead to supply- and demand-side fragmentation? On the supply side, 

could there be regional game developers? On the demand side, as internet connectivity improves 
across the world, will newly connected consumers have differing preferences and follow different 
usage patterns than their counterparts in developed economies? 

 — Casual gaming, especially on mobile phones, is driving significant growth in video games. Will 

casual games continue to take share from other sources of entertainment? 

 — Will AR/VR technologies that promise next-generation gaming experiences attain widespread 
commercial success? Although the Oculus Rift was first released in 2016, VR games remain  
a small part of the market. Will Apple’s Vision Pro and other new hardware bring VR to a  
wider audience?

14. Robotics

We define robots as programmable machines that automate physical tasks.267 Industrial robots 
have been performing a growing number of functions since the early 1960s, when Unimation 
installed a robot on an assembly line at a General Motors plant in Trenton, New Jersey, where 
it helped make door and window handles, gearshift knobs, light fixtures, and other automotive 
hardware.268 Today, technological advancements in robotics are accumulating, lowering barriers 
to adoption. Improvements in robot dexterity and mobility have enabled the machines to handle 
a greater variety of tasks. Robot-assisted surgery helps doctors perform delicate procedures 
with greater precision, flexibility, and control. In agriculture, robots are taking on environmental 
problems, such as reducing pollution.269 Restaurant chains have begun to deploy robots to 
automate some kitchen tasks. And labor shortages in retail and service jobs create further 
incentives for businesses to consider their use.

Technological advances in manufacturing processes and scale have driven down the cost of robotics 
hardware, while advances in software technology have improved the ability of robots to work with 
humans and enhanced quality through consistency. Advances in generative AI (gen AI) are speeding 
the development and training process and enhancing the flexibility of general-purpose and humanoid 
robots. For example, Figure has partnered with Open AI to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, 
using large language and behavioral models.270 There has been a surge in interest in these machines. 
While their resemblance to humans evokes science fiction (and the “uncanny valley” phenomenon), 
the practical potential benefit of humanoid robots is that anything designed for people—such 
as machinery, work areas, and other spaces or objects–would not need to be retrofitted to 
accommodate them.271 That could ease integration of the machines once the technology capabilities 
are fully developed.

The robotics industry is benefiting from a large influx of investment capital. From 2018 to 2022, 
venture capital investment in the field increased from $4.6 billion to $13.1 billion (a 23.3 percent 
CAGR), with much of the funds going to start-ups such as Covariant, an AI robotics company that 
raised a $75 million Series C round in April 2024.272 The Chinese start-up Unitree Robotics raised a 
$139 million Series B round in February 2024. And established players in other markets are entering 
the robotics sector via M&A and investments (for example, Hyundai Motor Group’s acquisition of 
Boston Dynamics in 2021, Amazon’s stake in Agility Robotics in 2022, and Figure’s $675 million 
Series B round that included investors such as Microsoft, OpenAI Startup Fund, Nvidia, Amazon 
Industrial Innovation Fund, and Jeff Bezos).273

As a result of these investments, robots could play an increasing role in our lives. Some notable 
recent developments include Amazon’s deployment of humanoid robots in a warehouse in Seattle, 
robot butlers providing room service deliveries in hotels, Google’s use of large language models  
to develop robots that can help with a broader range of everyday tasks, and the announcement  
by Nvidia in March 2024 that it planned to launch a general-purpose foundation model for 
humanoid robots.274

Growth
The outsize growth potential of robotics would be supported by technological advances and 
robotic solutions’ ability to automate physical work. Attaining the financial, social, and regulatory 
conditions that would allow mass adoption will also be key factors. Robotics is a broad and complex 
industry that can be understood through robot types, use cases, and the end markets they serve. 
The wide spectrum of robot capability includes agricultural automation, industrial robots in

factories, and even autonomous consumer vacuums. The growth of single-purpose robots over 
the past 20 to 30 years was largely driven by industrial automation, particularly in manufacturing 
environments and increasingly in warehouses. This segment has experienced stable growth, with 
an established value chain of original equipment manufacturers, system integrators, and software 
players adding capability.

Unimation’s first installed robotics system attempted to be general purpose but required a highly 
structured environment where everything had to be in the right place before the robot could be 
programmed. More recently, the industry has made substantive progress in the development of more 
autonomous general-purpose robots, which can now execute a variety of tasks with limited human 
intervention or physical modification of hardware. Through AI and adaptive control, they can even 
sense their surroundings, reducing the need for environmental control. Additionally, advancements in 
haptic technology facilitate enhanced picking and manipulation.275 Boston Dynamics, Tesla, Figure, 
Google, and Sanctuary are all working on autonomous general-purpose robots that can take on tasks 
currently performed by people, such as unloading boxes in a warehouse.

To model the growth of robotics as a potential arena, we analyzed the possibilities for automating 
physical work activities currently done by people, based on McKinsey Global Institute research on 
scenarios of workforce automation and the report The economic potential of generative AI.276 This 
is a conservative scope, given that some robots are being used and could increasingly be used to 
perform activities that are beyond the physical capabilities of people, such as lifting much heavier 
objects than a person can. 

The entire robotics industry, which is largely made up of industrial robots, automated guided vehicles, 
and autonomous mobile robots, had $21 billion in revenues in 2022.277 In our scenarios, in 2040, 
revenues for the entire industry could grow to $190 billion in a lower range of scenarios and to 
$910 billion in a higher range of scenarios, a CAGR of 13 to 23 percent. 

Our analysis estimated the revenue opportunity for robotics solutions by assessing the technical 
automation potential of 658 detailed work activities (DWAs) and three physical performance 
capabilities (fine motor skills, gross motor skills, and mobility) in 776 occupations.278 We then modeled 
adoption over time, including by comparing the declining cost of technology with hourly wage levels in 
each occupation in 47 countries that make up more than 80 percent of the world’s workforce.279  
We started with the total potential revenue baseline as the cost of human labor attributable to each 
DWA, which is calculated by multiplying volume (number of hours spent on an activity) by the cost  
(per hour) of a task. We then estimated the adoption potential of a technologically automated solution 
for that activity, based on S-shaped adoption curves for similar solutions, assuming that adoption  
of robotics does not begin until its cost is at parity with the cost of human labor. For each activity, 
slower and faster adoption scenarios were modeled to range the potential market for automating  
that activity. This analysis was aggregated for different points of adoption and different wage rates 
across countries.

Our scenarios incorporated the pace and extent of the adoption of robotic solutions according to four 
key factors: first, the technical automation potential of physical capabilities; second, the time needed 
to develop solutions for activities requiring physical capabilities; third, the economic feasibility of 
automation; and fourth, the pace of adoption, which includes differing levels of business investment, 
regulation, and social acceptance (exhibit).280

For the first factor, the model assumed that the automation potential of physical capabilities hinges 
on whether robotic technology has achieved the proficiency required to successfully execute a given 
physical task. Technical automation potential must necessarily precede adoption because robots can 
be deployed only after they match or outperform humans in the physical activities being automated. 
To gauge the opportunity presented by workforce automation, robotics researchers were surveyed to

derive a range of the time it would take robots’ gross motor skills, fine motor skills, and mobility skills 
to reach the equivalent of median and top-quartile human performance.281 Our higher-range scenario 
assumes these levels of capability are reached at the earlier end of these estimates, while our lower 
range of scenarios assumes that they are reached at the late end of these estimates, leading to 
delayed automation potential of relevant work activities. 

Perhaps surprisingly, minor tasks that are straightforward for people can be an impediment to robots’ 
ability to work without supervision, lengthening the timeline for full automation of these tasks. For 
example, specific actions such as tucking in the corner of a bedsheet present obstacles to developing 
fully independent cleaning robots, even those that are capable of performing the majority of skills 
needed to clean a hotel room. A robot that can pick an apple from a tree may be unable to harvest 
strawberries, because the consistency and shape of the stem of each berry are different. Our higher 
range of scenarios assumed that the technological capabilities allowing robots to tackle these 
bottleneck skills would be in place by 2040, resulting in higher levels of automation for each task. 
The lower range of scenarios accounted for the possibility that the bottleneck skills would delay full 
automation, with a correspondingly lower task automation adoption rate.

The second factor was the speed at which robotic products that solve specific problems might be 
developed. Our higher range of scenarios assumes that integration of discrete capabilities into 
solutions occurs more quickly, decreasing the time to market. Our lower range of scenarios assumes

longer timelines to integrate the technologies that transform specific capabilities into solutions that 
automate work activities. For example, a robot that can automate harvesting activities would need to 
have a wide range of skill sets to both work with a variety of produce and identify the type of produce. 

Third, we assume that innovative automation solutions would have to be economically feasible for 
users to adopt them. To make the substitution of physical automation for human labor economical, 
robots need to improve productivity compared with humans, for example by matching human speed 
on a single shift. Namely, we posit that adoption of robots for a given activity could begin only when 
the cost of automating that activity is equal to or less than the human labor cost for the same activity 
at the same level of skill. 

Robotics can provide other benefits besides labor cost savings, such as addressing labor shortages 
(Europe, for example, is facing a declining labor supply, with the workforce projected to shrink 
by 13.5 million people, or 4 percent, by 2030), increasing throughput, decreasing downtime, and 
creating a safer workplace.282

Finally, mass adoption of robotics solutions will likely depend on several financial, regulatory, and 
social factors that would influence the rate of deployment. Our higher range of scenarios envisions 
accelerated customer deployment of robots as people become more comfortable with working 
alongside the machines, investment to create a workforce that embraces automation for productivity 
gains, and government regulation in support of robots in the workplace. In addition, our higher 
range of scenarios assumes that consumers would fully embrace mass adoption of robots and a 
high degree of integration between humans and robots in daily interactions. In our lower range of 
scenarios, robots could be deployed at slower rates for several reasons, including social hurdles such 
as limited support for retraining workers, financial limitations such as delays in capital investment, 
and a lagging and limiting regulatory response that contributes to uncertainty or headwinds for the 
industry’s long-term outlook. 

Dynamism
The robotics arena is likely to display high dynamism as the use of robots expands from traditional 
industrial applications, such as manufacturing and materials handling, to service applications, such 
as cleaning, cooking, and maintenance. The dynamism could also be driven by the availability of even 
more applications through autonomous general-purpose or humanoid robots. Humanoid robots 
could complete difficult or dangerous warehouse tasks; monitor remotely distributed field assets 
such as power and telecommunication lines; assist healthcare professionals in physical tasks, such 
as moving patients and delivering equipment; and perform risky construction work.283

In the traditional single-purpose industrial robotics segment, long-established players, such as 
ABB, Fanuc, and Kuka, are leading a relatively stable, mature market. There is some potential 
for competitive shuffling as companies such as Denmark’s Universal Robotics try to create 
collaborative “co-bots” that work side by side with people, but generally, the industrial robotics 
segment is likely to continue with just a few large players.284 Conversely, newer segments, e.g., 
autonomous general-purpose robots, could see high levels of dynamism. Tech-forward players are 
creating several types of machines, including mobile, quadrupedal, and humanoid robots, as well 
as high-density storage automation. 

Moreover, the convergence of gen AI and robotics could dramatically improve robots’ abilities to 
interact with the physical world and perform complex real-world tasks, as a report by McKinsey’s 
Operations Practice points out.285 By incorporating AI-based large language models and large 
behavior models, robot control systems can help the machines understand and respond to verbal 
input as well as mimic human movement. This nascent market features many up-and-coming 
disruptors vying to be first to launch a workable product, which requires heavy investment in R&D

and a long runway reliant on venture capital funding. Boston Dynamics, Figure, Sanctuary, Tesla, and 
ANYbotics are early players in this segment, while several global players are emerging in Asia, such 
as Unitree, SinoRobotics, and DEEP Robotics.

The autonomous general-purpose robot market is likely to show high dynamism, but it also is likely to 
have fewer large players over time. The massive amounts of research and data needed to develop and 
manufacture the machines will likely benefit the players with the deepest pockets and largest scale. 
For example, in August 2022, Hyundai Motor Group—which acquired a controlling stake in Boston 
Dynamics in 2021 in a deal valued at $1.1 billion286—announced an initial $400 million investment to 
launch the Boston Dynamics AI Institute,287 dedicated to developing the next generation of machines 
at the intersection of AI and robotics. And, as with other AI-related products, the additional data that 
a company with robots in the field can use to make even better robots will likely build barriers to entry 
for new players.

Yet even though the wider autonomous general-purpose robotics market has fewer large players, 
there may be a burgeoning and much more fragmented market for robots with specific end markets 
and use cases. For example, Tortuga uses commercial harvesting robots to help farms automate 
harvesting, forecasting, and pest treatment, and Blue Ocean Robotics develops, produces, and sells 
service robots for tasks such as cleaning, disinfection procedures, and patient rehabilitation. This 
segment could show high dynamism alongside fragmentation, given the huge variety of use cases—
there are as many potential use cases as there are specific physical tasks that humans are paid to 
perform. As long as companies can find a viable business model, there can be more new entrants.

Use-case-specialized robotics players and autonomous general-purpose robotics players are 
operating in nascent markets that will likely show high dynamism, while the traditional industrial 
players operate in a more mature market environment. However, the boundaries between these 
segments are not sharply defined. The traditional industrial players may expand their offerings into 
some of the use-case-specialized end markets as these markets mature. Over a longer horizon, 
autonomous general-purpose robots might replace use-case-specific machines if the technological 
development of autonomous general-purpose robots is sufficiently advanced for them to take on a 
variety of use cases that are served today by specialized players at lower cost. And there are other 
applications of robots beyond our scope of automating human labor, for example deep sea and 
space exploration. These aren’t captured in this growth analysis, but to the extent that they are new 
applications and new technology solutions, they could develop high dynamism, too.

Swing factors 
 — What other technologies might accelerate the development of robotics? For example, gen AI is 

enabling faster training of robots, better semiconductors are accelerating computing power, and 
better batteries are enabling longer activity periods.

 — What new tasks will robots be able to perform that are beyond the physical limitations of humans 

today? How much productivity might this unlock? 

 — Apart from physical labor, how quickly will robots be capable of providing emotional labor and 

caretaking? Will consumers accept robotic caregivers?

 — How might policies related to labor issues affect the adoption of robotics?

 — How might potential market fragmentation caused by geopolitical developments lead to a 

regionalization of the robotics tech stack?

15. Industrial and consumer 
biotechnology

Industrial and consumer biotechnology is the use of genetic engineering to analyze and manipulate 
biological processes at a molecular level to create bio-based products for industrial and consumer 
purposes. This field could have transformative effects on society as companies develop revolutionary 
products such as drought-resistant crops, at-home genetic testing, and specialty chemicals 
manufactured in sustainable and cheaper ways by genetically engineered microbes. 

The field has made huge strides over the past 20 years. Several advances have enabled the 
commercialization of gene editing, including automated genetic sequencing (to “read” genetic code) 
and CRISPR, a technology that can be used to selectively modify DNA (to “write” genetic code).288 
Research on CRISPR started in 1987, and the full CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing system was published 
in 2012. The team that developed the technology was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2020. The precision 
and applicability of CRISPR-Cas9 was a step change that enabled the wide-scale commercialization 
of gene editing today. Using CRISPR and similar tools, scientists can edit genes with extraordinary 
precision. This capability could upend established markets or create entirely new demand in many 
areas, including cultivated meat and personalized beauty products, among many others. 

Biotech has recently encountered investment headwinds: in 2023, industrial and consumer biotech 
start-ups raised $2.1 billion, down from $4.9 billion in 2022.289 However, start-up funding in most 
industries outside of AI also decreased, with global investments declining 38 percent between 2022 
and 2023 (while funding to AI increased 9 percent).290 Despite this recent volatility, there are many 
reasons to believe that the industrial and consumer biotech sector has the fundamentals to exhibit 
promising growth and dynamism in the long term. 

Growth
The drivers of potential outsized growth for industrial and consumer biotechnology are specific to 
different segments, but they include demand for more resilient, personalized, and environmentally 
friendly products, consumer comfort and regulatory support for genetically engineered products 
and associated data collection, and technology advances to boost resource efficiency and bring 
costs down. Additional growth enablers include technology advances to accelerate R&D, efficient 
commercialization, governmental investments, and demand for sustainable products. 

We analyzed four significant biotechnology segments in our sizing of the industry: agricultural 
biotechnology, alternative proteins, biomaterials and biochemicals, and consumer products and 
services (exhibit). We excluded biopharmaceuticals and sustainable biofuels, both of which we 
discuss in chapter 3. In our estimates, the industry’s revenues grow from $140 billion in 2022 to 
$340 billion in 2040 in the lower range of scenarios and to $900 billion by 2040 in the higher range 
of scenarios, a CAGR of 5 to 11 percent.291

Agricultural biotechnology. This segment’s revenues are projected to grow from $56 billion in 2022 
to $170 billion in 2040 in the lower range of scenarios and to $230 billion in 2040 in the higher range 
of scenarios, a CAGR of 6 to 8 percent.

The pace of agricultural biotechnology’s adoption could depend on three factors. First, its use 
could accelerate if it offers a resource-efficient way of addressing the growing global population’s 
food needs. Global calorie demand could increase more than 30 percent between 2020 and 
2050, and production, especially in developing economies, would need to almost double. At the

same time, there is mounting pressure to reduce agriculture’s land use intensity. This includes 
environmental efforts to protect rainforests and other nonagricultural lands, as well as concerns 
about the increasing use of agricultural land for nonfood purposes such as biofuels.292 Agricultural 
biotechnology could alleviate these pressures by increasing yields. For example, field tests 
conducted from 2014 to 2017 in corn-growing areas of the United States showed that genetically 
modified hybrids typically yielded 3 to 5 percent more grain than conventional plants, and in some 
cases, up to 10 percent more.293 

Second, biotechnology can help develop crops that withstand adverse factors such as pests, 
droughts, and floods, which could become more frequent in an era of climate uncertainty. For 
example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops are genetically modified to contain endospore toxins of the 
bacterium, making them resistant to certain insect pests. By 2023, adoption of Bt corn in the United 
States reached 85 percent, more than double its 40 percent adoption rate in 2006. 

Third, consumer resistance to genetically modified foods could slow adoption of biotechnology. 
Significant movements in North America, Europe, and around the world are lobbying to restrict or ban 
the use of the technology in the food system. Concerns revolve around the potential for allergenicity, 
antibiotic resistance, and a spillover of genetically modified plants into conventional crops that could 
reduce biodiversity. The European Union has long had strict regulations on genetically modified

crops, though there has been recent movement toward permitting techniques such as gene 
editing.294 Activists have protested India’s approval of genetically modified mustard, and an attempt 
to introduce genetically modified maize seeds to Kenya in 2022 was blocked by legal challenges.295 
The policies and regulatory frameworks that result from these growing movements may affect the 
adoption of the technology.296

Alternative proteins. This market’s revenues are projected to grow from $2 billion in 2020 to 
$24 billion in 2040 in the lower range of scenarios and to $390 billion in 2040 in the higher range of 
scenarios, a CAGR of 15 to 35 percent. The middle estimate for alternative proteins puts the market at 
$130 billion in 2040. This wide range reflects the market’s nascency and the uncertainty that stems 
from its dependence on scientific breakthroughs and major consumer dietary shifts. The estimates 
include fermented and cell-based alternative proteins but exclude plant-based products. 

Three key factors are likely to determine the segment’s growth. First, the market’s trajectory is 
shaped by the increasing share of protein in global diets, which correlates closely with economic 
development and per capita GDP growth. According to the OECD and the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, meat consumption could increase 2 percent by 2033, driven 
primarily by population and income growth in middle-income countries, and 79 percent of total 
growth could come from middle-income countries, even as consumption in most high-income 
countries is expected to stagnate. The increasing demand for meat, particularly in developing 
countries, could create an opportunity for alternative proteins to play an important role in meeting 
global meat and protein needs. 

Second, alternative proteins could significantly increase their share of total protein consumption 
in coming decades. For now, they constitute just 0.8 percent of the overall protein market, though 
that share could grow to between 1.0 and 9.0 percent by 2040. However, reaching the higher range 
of these estimates would depend largely on overcoming formidable barriers such as consumer 
acceptance and taste and texture preferences. The public’s acceptance and widespread use of 
alternative proteins could hinge on R&D efforts focused on making products that match or surpass 
the taste and satisfaction provided by traditional protein sources. As these challenges are addressed, 
alternative proteins would be poised to play a more substantial role in future dietary choices and 
global food systems.

Third, price stands out as the most significant barrier to widespread adoption. A 2022 paper found 
that in 2013, the cost of producing cultured meat297 in the lab was $2.3 million per kilogram, though 
with technological breakthroughs, that cost could be significantly reduced to $63 per kilogram, still 
about ten times as expensive as the wholesale price of animal meat.298 High production costs are a 
function of both operating costs (for example, growth factors) and inadequate yields (meat produced 
per volume of bioreactor), both areas of active research and continued progress. In tandem with 
further efficiencies and learning from operating at large scale, advances in these areas can further 
drive down unit costs considerably. Crucially, the trajectory of regulatory frameworks, such as the 
promotion of carbon pricing and land conservation measures, will heavily influence the comparative 
price dynamics of alternative and conventional proteins. These regulations could improve or hinder 
the cost competitiveness of alternative proteins, shaping their market viability and adoption rates in 
the years to come.

Biomaterials and biochemicals. Biomaterials and biochemicals are substances or materials 
produced by microorganisms or created through biological processes such as fermentation and 
biocatalysis. These include biopolymers as well as enzymes for use as feed additives or required 
for industrial processes. The end-use cases include chemical processing and materials production, 
household products, agriculture, food, and nutrition. For example, corporate players and start-ups 
have developed and commercialized biotechnology-based additives for use in food, animal feed, and 
microbial products to improve yield or nutrition. The biomaterials and biochemicals market’s revenues

grow from $41 billion in 2022 to $70 billion in 2040 in our lower range of scenarios and to $100 billion 
in 2040 in our higher range of scenarios, a CAGR of 3 to 5 percent. In the higher range, this market 
grows and biomaterial or biochemical substitutes would increase their share relative to traditional 
materials. In the lower range, the market grows steadily but biomaterial and biochemical penetration 
would remain the same.

The market trajectory of the biomaterials industry could depend on two main factors: whether 
customers will be willing to pay a higher price for substitutes over traditional (synthetic) materials, 
and the extent to which the properties of novel biosubstitutes will be comparable or superior to 
traditional materials.

First, biomaterials and biochemicals are often more expensive than traditional materials, which 
can affect their market penetration. For instance, biodegradable plastics derived from renewable 
biomass sources such as cornstarch, sugarcane, and potato starch are designed to be broken 
down using standard procedures. By contrast, traditional plastics are nondegradable, durable, 
and persistent, and accumulate in the environment. However, biomaterial substitutes often cost 
approximately 20 to 30 percent more because of the higher cost of raw materials and complex 
production processes. 

Second, biomaterials often face challenges due to inferior material properties that can hinder their 
adoption rate. Biodegradable plastics, for instance, are engineered for functions similar to those 
performed by products made from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride, such as 
plastic bags, containers, and pipes, but the biodegradable materials may be less durable or have 
other performance limitations. For example, starch-based biodegradable plastics are known to have 
poor mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, and low thermal stability, while polylactic acid bioplastics 
can exhibit brittleness and elevated moisture uptake.299 These factors influence market dynamics, 
shaping both consumer preferences and industry innovation aimed at enhancing the viability 
and competitiveness of biomaterial solutions. Moreover, according to a McKinsey report, “not all 
biomaterials are created equally,” and the end-user adoption rate of biomaterials will depend upon 
the ability of companies to understand the technical differentiation of different products and select 
the appropriate end market.300

Consumer products and services. In our estimates, this market’s revenues grow from $36 billion in 
2022 to $71 billion in 2040 in our lower range of scenarios and to $170 billion in 2040 in our higher 
range of scenarios, a CAGR of 4 to 9 percent.

The market could include a wide variety of goods and services created by industrial and consumer 
biotechnology: direct-to-consumer genetic testing; meals and vitamins based on people’s genes; 
microbial skin-care products; gene therapy for cosmetic purposes, such as reversing hair loss; 
genetic tests and treatments for pets; and perhaps even genetically modified pets. Most of these do 
not exist yet, though some do; for example, 23andMe has offered consumers saliva-based genetic 
testing since the mid-2000s, and companies are launching subscription-based meal plans and 
dietary supplements tailored to customers’ DNA and microbiomes. 

The personalized nature of these innovative products and services and their potential to enhance 
individual well-being could fuel consumer interest in solutions tailored to genetic or physical profiles, 
dietary needs, and aesthetic preferences. For example, companies like Ancestry and 23andMe 
have capitalized on the growing demand for personalized healthcare by offering genetic analysis 
services that could aid the early detection of hereditary diseases. These factors will likely continue 
to drive future demand as customers increasingly seek tailored products that leverage technological 
advances to better meet their needs.

The market’s revenues will depend significantly on whether companies can address current 
regulatory concerns about the collection of genetic information and create enticing value

propositions at reasonable prices. Revenues will also depend on whether companies can accept 
the long development times that frequently characterize these kinds of products and services. For 
example, businesses are already planning ways to monetize the genetic data collected by some of 
these technologies—an endeavor that could prompt privacy and regulatory concerns.

Four key enablers could accelerate growth in all four segments. First, advanced computing, data 
analytics, machine learning, AI, and biological engineering are accelerating R&D. For example, in 
2023, Google DeepMind introduced GNoME, a new deep learning tool that can help discover new 
materials by predicting their stability. The AI tool was used to find 380,000 stable materials that 
could hold promise for future technologies.301 Second, efficient commercialization to scale from lab 
to mass production is vital. Third, public and government investments, such as the US government’s 
$2 billion in funding for biotechnology and biomanufacturing, could further support these efforts. 
Fourth, continued corporate commitments to and consumer interest in sustainability will set the 
pace of growth in the industrial and consumer biotech market. The market for biomaterials is likely 
to expand more rapidly in scenarios where sustainability commitments are emphasized. Conversely, 
market growth could be slower if these commitments wane, as price and convenience could outweigh 
environmental considerations for both consumers and businesses.

Dynamism
The industrial and consumer biotechnology industry is young, and thus likely to show high dynamism, 
as companies seek to develop viable technologies and find sustainable business models for 
revenues and profits. For now, the industry is fragmented and contains small, science-focused start-
ups; incumbents in industries that make products that biotechnological advances would replace; 
and cross-sector platform companies that provide product-development services such as R&D, 
commercialization, and manufacturing. However, it is possible that just a few larger companies will 
emerge as the industry matures. An early-mover advantage would give these larger players the 
scale and financial reserves to increase their investments in R&D and bring new products to market 
faster. Larger companies with early successes would also have the cash and reputation to find novel 
biotechnologies by acquiring smaller upstarts, as occurred in the pharmaceutical industry. The 
need for high R&D investment could create barriers to market entry and cause a few large players to 
emerge over time. 

Larger companies could acquire agricultural biotechnology start-ups to bring new innovations to 
market at scale. For example, Cardea Bio led the research initiative to develop a biocompatible 
semiconductor that could translate real-time multiomics signals into digital information. Cardea was 
acquired by Paragraf, an integrated device manufacturer in the semiconductor industry, to accelerate 
the mass production of these devices.

However, the direction and pace of scientific advancement are not always linear, and higher 
R&D budgets are no guarantee of bringing a successful product to market. The number of larger 
companies might also be limited if smaller upstarts continue to make breakthroughs that can be 
brought to market relatively easily. In addition, platform players that provide biotech services such 
as strain engineering, fermentation optimization, and product development could support a more 
fragmented market by providing pathways for product development and commercialization, allowing 
smaller players to access the resources required to scale their innovations.

16. Future air mobility

A variety of new future air mobility use cases—in transportation of people and goods and in 
surveillance—are emerging as advances in technology enable new types of aircraft and operations. 
The market segments in the industry include urban air mobility, regional air mobility, last-mile delivery 
drones, and supersonic and hypersonic transportation. We focus on two of them: passenger urban air 
mobility and last-mile drone delivery. If their makers’ ambitions come to pass, electric vertical takeoff 
and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) and delivery drones could become a common sight in many cities, 
turning skylines into scenes from science fiction.

The future air mobility industry is fueled by four major trends: the rapid advances of technologies 
such as batteries, autonomy, and digital engineering; the global focus on sustainability; the increasing 
prominence of shared mobility; and the need to create solutions to traffic congestion. Indicators 
suggest that the industry could become an arena by 2040. Annual disclosed funding for future air 
mobility grew from less than $600 million in 2017 to $5 billion in 2023, with cumulative disclosed 
investment of $22 billion. From 2013 to 2023, about $18 billion was invested in passenger eVTOL and 
last-mile delivery drone businesses.302 Moreover, several eVTOLs (such as aircraft from Archer, Joby, 
Lilium, Volocopter, and others) are undergoing flight testing for certification, and companies have 
already started making last-mile deliveries by drone, including more than one million deliveries in 
2023 for last-mile logistics, restaurants, groceries, and healthcare providers.303

Most passenger eVTOLs would typically carry two to six passengers and are generally designed 
for intracity trips (up to 50 kilometers) and urban or suburban trips (50 to 120 kilometers). Last-mile 
delivery drones are far smaller and typically carry packages lighter than 10 kilograms containing 
goods such as groceries, medicine, mail, and retail items. Both eVTOLs and delivery drones are 
powered by battery-electric power trains; the drones would mostly take off and land vertically. 

Growth 
The future air mobility industry’s revenues are almost nonexistent today and could grow substantially 
in the coming years, with projections ranging from $75 billion by 2040 in the lower range of scenarios 
to $340 billion by 2040 in the higher range of scenarios.304 The industry could see rapid growth 
through 2035 due to its nascency, but growth could moderate once the industry achieves some 
scale. However, even at scale, the industry would still represent only a small share of the larger 
transportation market; for example, in these estimates, passenger eVTOLs would account for the 
equivalent of less than 1 percent of all trips undertaken via ground transportation.305

We measure the industry’s revenues as the amount the service operators would take in. We 
estimate that 20 to 35 percent of the total revenues of passenger eVTOL operators could be paid to 
manufacturers (with much of that paid to suppliers of components, such as batteries, airframes, and 
aircraft systems), and 10 to 40 percent would be allocated to suppliers of mobility platforms (including 
software for ticketing, scheduling, and navigation), licensing, financing, insurance, and air traffic 
management. 

The growth of the industry will likely depend on three main factors: price, customers’ preferences, 
and the rate of technological advancement in battery performance and autonomy.306 However, 
two additional factors could limit that growth: regulation and the development of necessary 
infrastructure.

Price: For the industry to grow toward the higher end of our range of revenues, the price of an eVTOL 
trip or drone delivery would have to become competitive with that of other modes of transportation.

Future air mobility

For example, the median price of a regular ride-hailing service in 2022 varied highly by location, 
from as low as $0.50 per kilometer in much of South and Central America to as high as $3.50 per 
kilometer in New York and $4.30 per kilometer in Bern, Switzerland.307 Our estimates suggest that for 
eVTOLs, the price once the market reaches scale could be between $2.00 and $4.50 per passenger 
per kilometer, driven by a combination of component costs, operational costs like pilot salaries and 
maintenance, infrastructure costs, and the economics of round-trip traffic, charging, maintenance 
times, and peak-hour utilization.308 This suggests that eVTOLs could offer a service that would be 
competitively priced compared with premium ground transportation, especially in areas where 
ground transportation is expensive. And even at a higher price, some customers might be willing to 
pay for passenger eVTOLs if they are more convenient or faster than the alternatives.

Last-mile delivery drones may also become cost competitive. Current unit delivery cost by drone 
is higher than delivery by van, especially if the van is carrying multiple packages. However, this is 
partly because in some jurisdictions, regulations permit a person to operate only one drone at a time 
within visual line of sight. But if an operator could oversee 20 drones beyond visual line of sight, 
drone delivery costs could become comparable to van delivery costs, according to our estimates. 
Completely automated drones could drive those costs down even further.309 Minimizing drones’ 
footprints (by optimizing their use of airspace or changing drone size) and maximizing throughput (by 
improving utilization) could also affect unit delivery cost by drone.

Customers’ preferences: A McKinsey survey of about 5,000 respondents indicated that although 
meaningful numbers of customers would consider eVTOLs for commuting, running errands, business 
and leisure travel, or getting to the airport, many were concerned about aircraft safety and trip 
price.310 The survey also found that time savings was by far the main reason most respondents gave 
for considering eVTOLs, suggesting that people in cities with severe traffic congestion or geographic 
obstacles might be more open to using them. Current users of limousine and ride-hailing services 
were also likelier to say they might use passenger eVTOLs. 

Customer experience will help determine the extent to which eVTOLs are adopted. The aircraft might 
save time, but car travel also has advantages.311 For example, taxis and ride-hailing services operate 
on demand, whereas some passenger eVTOL flights are expected to follow a schedule. In addition, 
most eVTOL passengers could still need to arrange ground transportation for the first and last mile 
of their journeys. Reliability might also be an issue, because aircraft require more maintenance and 
stricter safety protocols than cars, and their operations could be subject to weather cancellations.

The future of last-mile delivery drones also depends on how well they can meet a variety of customer 
needs and overcome the public’s hesitation. On the one hand, drones could reach remote areas with 
poor roads and could circumvent traffic congestion in cities, satisfying customers’ preference for 
delivery speed and convenience. According to a McKinsey survey, 56 percent of consumers would 
choose drone delivery if it was faster than traditional delivery and cost the same. On the other hand, 
McKinsey research also suggests that the safety of drone deliveries, the noise they produce, and the 
potential invasion of privacy are of concern to consumers.

Battery technology: While companies have already addressed many of the key technical challenges 
for eVTOL flight, batteries, in particular, pose a large challenge. Technical challenges remain in areas 
such as battery density (how much energy and thus range of flight a battery can supply per unit of 
weight), cycle life (lifespan before replacement), recharge time, and performance in cold weather, 
when batteries underperform. For example, enabling longer regional commutes via eVTOLs could 
require higher-density batteries. 

Moreover, for eVTOL services to reach profitability, their batteries would have to be able to charge 
and discharge more quickly than electric car batteries and have longer lifetimes. Similarly, while 
current battery technology is able to support drone use cases involving flights up to 60 minutes,

last-mile delivery drones would benefit from further improvements in battery technology that enable 
longer flights. The good news is that battery technology is advancing rapidly (see the “Batteries” 
entry in this compendium). Growth in future air mobility will depend on the speed of technological 
advancement in battery technology and the cost at which batteries can be provided.

Regulation: For eVTOLs to scale up, regulations allowing and governing their deployment will be 
necessary. In 2023, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced the steps needed to 
achieve a competitive, scaled-up air taxi market by 2028.312 The European Union Aviation Safety 
Agency has been developing a set of conditions for the certification of new passenger eVTOLs.313 
Some companies, such as AutoFlight and EHang, have already received airworthiness certification 
in China.314 But fully building out a mature eVTOL-specific regulatory environment may take time. 
Some eVTOLs could be operated autonomously one day, presenting a whole new set of regulatory 
considerations.

Regulatory standards for delivery drones are also starting to evolve. For instance, Australia has 
approved Wing for drone deliveries in North Canberra, and Logan and Swoop Aero for drone 
deliveries within 60 kilometers of bases in Toowoomba and Goondiwindi.315 Meituan has been 
approved in China and made more than 100,000 drone deliveries in Shenzhen in 2022.316 In addition, 
SF Express received a license for delivery drones in January 2022 and has established more than 
60 routes covering areas in Longgang, Nanshan, Luohu, Longhua, and Pingshan. In the United 
States, the FAA authorized operations beyond visual line of sight at seven test sites in September 
2023 for UPS Flight Forward and Zipline. Since then, the number of companies with specific 
approvals has grown sharply and now includes Amazon, Wing, and DroneUp, among many other 
operators, though they are mostly operating at a small number of facilities and locations. Authorities 
in the European Union and the United Kingdom have also made progress.317

Infrastructure: In some cases, passenger eVTOLs could take off and land at existing regional airports 
or heliports. But larger-scale passenger operations would require dedicated boarding and loading 
facilities, where the eVTOLs would also be parked and serviced. More important, establishing 
physical infrastructure such as takeoff and landing spots along passengers’ preferred routes will 
be crucial. As detailed in a McKinsey article, without a robust network of facilities, known as ports, 
“flying-vehicle transport could follow a pattern similar to that seen in today’s helicopter market, where 
the number of potential destinations is limited.”318 These networks would require land and investment. 
In addition, existing facilities would need retrofitting to accommodate the charging infrastructure 
needed for eVTOLs. Investment in more extensive facilities could follow as the market takes root 
and demand grows. An urban network of facilities with 85 to 105 landing pads could cost between 
$230 million and $300 million to build and between $165 million and $195 million annually to operate. 
There are already some plans in North America and Europe to start developing such networks, and 
about 20 ports were under way in each region as of 2022.319

Delivery drones also require some specialized infrastructure. However, since it can be built with 
smaller footprints in areas outside dense urban centers and the facilities may need fewer or smaller 
landing pads, the challenges for building physical infrastructure aren’t as limiting. At the same time, 
advancements in digital infrastructure, such as more sophisticated unmanned traffic management 
(UTM) systems, are key to realizing innovative drone delivery applications. Advancements in UTM 
technology that enable sophisticated drone tracking and coordination with air traffic control systems 
can help enable higher-altitude drone flights than are currently feasible.320

Dynamism
Because the industry is nascent, any growth would constitute a major share shift, increasing the 
likelihood that future air mobility would qualify as an arena. In the meantime, it is possible to glimpse 
the contours of the industry that could emerge.

Future air mobility

While passenger eVTOLs are still in their infancy, the prospect of scaling them up could be attractive 
to new entrants, especially as the vehicles spread to new regions. Once the market reaches a certain 
size, economies of scale and customer acquisition would probably lead to consolidation of market 
share among leading players as providers drop out, much as we have seen in the ride-hailing industry, 
as players without significant capital backing exit the market.

It is unclear whether the most successful business model will be a vertically integrated one, in 
which eVTOLs are built and operated by the same company, or a more traditional supply chain, in 
which manufacturers build eVTOLs and sell them to operators. If vertically integrated companies 
manage to operate more efficiently and beat out smaller companies, the industry could favor fewer 
large players. But if the ability to operate in heterogeneous markets promotes a structure in which 
manufacturers sell eVTOLs to operators, the industry could instead become more fragmented, 
with a smaller set of manufacturers but a large set of local operators. Business models may also be 
unique to different regions and their regulatory and cost landscape, so a one-size-fits-all solution 
may not prevail globally.

Prospects for last-mile delivery drones are somewhat easier to observe in the short term because 
they are already operating commercially, unlike eVTOLs. Some companies are doing trials, and others 
are already scaling up operations to deliver medical supplies, retail purchases, and food. In the most 
common business model, drone manufacturers operate last-mile delivery services in partnership with 
retailers, medical organizations, or third-party logistics providers. For example, in March 2024, Wing 
and the food-delivery service DoorDash announced a pilot program in Virginia, following a 2022 
pilot in Australia that has since grown to include more than 60 restaurants and other merchants.321 
Walmart has partnered with four drone delivery companies and established 36 stores as drone 
delivery hubs.322 In addition, major retail and logistics companies are developing in-house drone 
delivery technology; Amazon Prime Air is an example. 

In the long term, the drone-delivery market could have a small number of large players regionally 
or even globally, depending on the extent to which different regions require different operations. 
Business models may also evolve as the market matures and companies develop deep expertise and 
specialization. Since the hardware is likely to become commoditized, companies that can operate 
scaled-up networks cheaply, optimize logistics, and satisfy complex regulatory requirements could 
have an advantage. Scale will help delivery drone operators build these advantages, conferring a 
first-mover advantage and raising barriers to entry for new players. 

Swing factors
 — What steps might regulatory bodies (such as the FAA) take to enable the industry to operate at 

scale (for example, greater coordination with industry)? 

 — Can passenger eVTOL companies build a sustainable business model and achieve profitability, 

and what timeline would let them avoid remaining an expensive niche product? 

 — How will public acceptance of these innovations evolve and affect the market, especially when 
it comes to concerns about safety and noise? Would consumers be willing to pay a premium for 
future air mobility over other modes of transportation?

17. Drugs for obesity and 
related conditions

As the world grows more prosperous and people live longer, the already large impacts of chronic 
conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, 
diabetes, and brain diseases (including Alzheimer’s disease) are expected to increase.323 In the 
United States alone, the number of people over 50 with at least one chronic disease is projected to 
double from 72 million in 2020 to 143 million by 2050.324 Globally, chronic diseases were causes or 
contributing factors in 75 percent of deaths in 2010 and 79 percent in 2020; by 2030, experts predict 
that they could be a factor in up to 84 percent of global mortality as more countries develop.325

A 2010 report from the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Economic Forum calculated 
the global economic burden of chronic diseases by using a cost-of-illness approach that includes 
both direct costs (those associated with diagnosis, treatment, and care) and indirect costs (such 
as lost income). The report found that cardiovascular disease, cancer, COPD, diabetes, and mental 
illness cost a combined $6.25 trillion globally in 2010. Using an alternative approach, the report 
found that the total lost economic output due to reduced labor and capital inputs caused by chronic 
disease mortality could cumulatively reach nearly $47 trillion from 2011 to 2030.326 This economic 
impact is surely eclipsed only by the human cost of these diseases, which diminish both longevity 
and quality of life. These chronic conditions require a strong response aimed at “adding years to life 
and life to years.”327

Obesity, the prevalence of which has skyrocketed over the past 20 years, has been directly 
linked to some of these chronic conditions, contributing to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and 
some cancers.328 A report by the World Obesity Federation calculates that the economic impact 
attributable to obesity alone was $2.0 trillion in 2020 and is projected to increase to $4.3 trillion 
by 2035.329 A McKinsey Health Institute (MHI) analysis calculated the obesity-attributable disease 
burden measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which combine the years of life lost to 
premature mortality with years of life lost to states of less than full health or of disability.330 One DALY 
represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health. According to MHI, 153 million global 
DALYs could be attributed to obesity in 2019. Many of these DALYs were due to obesity’s connection 
to chronic conditions: 41 million from ischemic heart disease and 34 million from type 2 diabetes.331

The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and obesity has led pharmaceutical companies into a 
race to develop more effective therapeutics that could bring about step changes in the treatment and 
management of these conditions.332 One class of drugs, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s)—
alone and in combination with gastric inhibitory polypeptides (GIPs)—appears to have the potential 
to greatly change the trajectory of obesity-related ailments. Starting in 2021, these drugs (originally 
developed to treat diabetes) began receiving approvals for treatment of obesity as well. The results 
have been striking: sales of GLP-1-based therapies such as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic reached 
$24 billion in 2022 alone, and the drugs have proved so popular that manufacturing supply has not 
kept up with demand. 

The first wave of GLP-1s has already driven substantial growth for drugmakers. In the seven years 
since Novo Nordisk launched Ozempic as a drug for type 2 diabetes, the company’s value has 
increased sevenfold to a market capitalization greater than $490 billion, and it has become the 
world’s 12th-largest company and Europe’s largest, surpassing giants such as LVMH.333 Eli Lilly, 
with a market capitalization of more than $800 billion, recently became the world’s most valuable 
pharmaceutical company, partly as a result of its GLP-1 agonist, Mounjaro/Zepbound.334 In addition,

the opportunities in the market have already drawn potential entrants: both Amgen and Pfizer had 
GLP-1 weight loss drugs in Phase II trials as of June 2023, while AstraZeneca and Roche concluded 
multibillion-dollar deals to secure weight loss drugs currently in development.335

Some studies suggest that these drugs could have broader uses, including the treatment of other 
chronic diseases. According to a 2019 study, GLP-1 agonists could help reduce inflammation, lower 
blood pressure, and produce neuroprotective effects, all of which are correlated with a reduced 
prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease, hypertension, and fatty liver disease.336

The rapidly growing market for obesity-related drugs is poised to expand further as pharmaceutical 
companies race to develop new versions of the GLP-1 agonists. Moreover, GLP-1s are just one class 
of drugs that could improve outcomes related to obesity. As the pharmaceutical industry invests 
in medical solutions across the range of chronic diseases, the potential for more breakthroughs 
indicates that these therapies are likely to become an arena.

Growth
While nascent demand across the range of chronic diseases is high, we focus on the obesity drug 
industry—which has already seen a breakthrough—as a real-life example of what could happen with 
treatments for chronic diseases. We anticipate that growth in this industry and its rapid technological 
innovations may derive from consistent demand due to rising rates of obesity and other chronic 
ailments, the price sensitivity of pharmaceuticals, and rates of patients’ adoption and treatment. We 
measure the industry’s revenues as the total global sales of GLP-1s and other obesity drug therapies 
for patients who are diagnosed with obesity and are prescribed the drugs as part of their treatment. 
Some of these patients may use the drug in its injectable form, and others could eventually take an 
oral solid pill if companies are successful in developing one. 

In our modeling, the market could grow from $24 billion in 2022 to $120 billion by 2040 in a lower 
range of scenarios and to $280 billion by 2040 in a higher range, a 9 to 15 percent CAGR.337 This 
growth rate would imply a market size of $50 billion to $70 billion in 2030 assuming continuous 
growth from 2022 to 2030, though the market may grow faster until 2030 than it would from 2030 
to 2040. Faster growth through 2030 seems possible, and projections from Goldman Sachs, JP 
Morgan, and others have estimated that the market could exceed $100 billion by 2030.338

The key driver of the range of market projections is the price of obesity drugs. While our analysis 
assumes that improved clinical outcomes, reduced manufacturing and production costs, 
increased competition, and the loss of exclusivity will drive down prices over time, the extent of 
the decrease, along with its associated volume impacts (the number of patients accessing obesity 
drugs), will determine the size of the market. This price sensitivity is due to the unique nature of the 
pharmaceuticals market, where prices are not solely the outcome of a supply and demand market 
equilibrium but are driven by a country-specific mix of intellectual property, healthcare regulatory and 
reimbursement policies, and local competitive dynamics. 

The adoption by the public of new GLP-1-based drug therapies or other innovative formulations is 
fueled by the limitations of existing obesity and weight loss therapies. The new GLP-1 agonist-based 
drugs such as Ozempic—which seem to emulate the effects of hormones that make patients feel 
sated, though their exact mechanism is still being researched—have transformed the expectations 
of weight loss efficacy, with some medications promising reductions in body weight of more than 
15 percent.339 That is nearly double the efficacy of previous GLP-1 weight loss drugs, such as Novo 
Nordisk’s liraglutide-based Saxenda, which was associated with less than 10 percent weight loss. 

Rising rates of obesity point to a growing global need for effective treatments. Obesity already affects 
about 16 percent of the global adult population (defined as those age 20 and over) and is projected 
in the World Obesity Federation’s 2023 Atlas to affect about 25 percent of adults worldwide by

2035.340 To calculate the 2040 obese population, we used the obesity rates in the World Obesity 
Atlas projected for 2035 along with the medium fertility variant from the UN’s World Population 
Prospects for the total adult population by region.341 This showed that more than 1.5 billion adults 
could be affected by obesity in 2040, in an estimated global population of 9.2 billion. This scenario 
is segmented by regional estimates of the prevalence of obesity, from North America and Latin 
America, where nearly 50 percent of the population could experience obesity in 2040, to Asia and 
Oceania, where only 13 percent and 17 percent of the population, respectively, would experience the 
disease in 2040.

Our scenarios for possible market sizes in 2040 consider the following factors: the rising prevalence 
of obesity globally, the annual cost of drugs per patient, and the subsequent obesity diagnosis and 
drug treatment rates. To account for price elasticities, our approach explores two price scenarios and 
makes some assumptions about the volume implications for each. We start with price, which could 
be the biggest factor determining how widespread these drugs become because there is so much 
latent global demand for obesity treatments. The number of patients with access to the drugs could 
expand significantly if the annual cost per patient is relatively low. Other interdependent factors could 
affect this market’s shape in 2040. The trajectory of research into new formulations—for example, 
the development of an effective oral solid obesity pill rather than the current injectables—and these 
treatments’ effects on related conditions like heart disease, along with regulatory outcomes and 
competitive moves by players in the market, are impossible to predict but will play a large role in 
shaping the future of these drugs globally. 

However, we can imagine a scenario in which improved clinical outcomes, reduced manufacturing 
and production costs, increased competition, and the loss of exclusivity drive down the price 
of obesity drugs over time, in which case the addressable market would go from niche to truly 
mainstream. Wegovy, the leading GLP-1 agonist prescribed for weight loss, is currently listed at 
about $16,000 a year in the United States, though the net price received by the manufacturer after 
discounts and coupons is about $8,400, according to a 2023 study by the American Enterprise 
Institute.342 The cost of these medications could decline as a result of improvements to production 
and innovative formulations (think oral solid pills). 

As many pharmaceutical companies research and release new obesity drugs, competition in the 
industry is likely to increase, which would result in lower prices. The Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services may choose Ozempic (which is not approved for weight loss) for price negotiations 
under the Inflation Reduction Act.343 Patent protection for the branded injectable GLP-1 agonist 
compound used in Wegovy and Ozempic is set to end in the early 2030s, when generic producers 
will step into the market, increasing downward pressure on prices. How low the price could fall may 
depend on how much producers can lower their production costs, as well as the number of new 
entrants and the intensity of competition in the market. Outside of price and its impacts on volume, 
other factors also affect diagnosis and treatment rates, including but not limited to impediments to 
physicians prescribing the drugs, limited coverage for obesity therapies, and concerns about the 
costs and side effects of long-term obesity treatment. 

In the higher range of scenarios we model, prices drop radically, to an average of $500 a year per 
patient worldwide, across all available obesity medications. We chose $500 as a comparable price 
to other widely used drugs treating chronic conditions, such as statins,344 and slightly less than 
AARP’s estimate of the average annual cost of therapy for a widely used generic drug at $679 per 
year.345 In this scenario, it is likely that pharmaceutical companies would succeed in further reducing 
the costs of production and that there would be a diverse market with branded and generic GLP-1s 
competing for patient access. In this scenario, we assume diagnosis and treatment rates similar to 
those for heart disease patients who take statins and similar medications to manage blood pressure. 
We model a scenario in which approximately 75 percent of North Americans with obesity would take

the drugs, along with 50 percent of Europeans and 20 to 50 percent of populations in Asia, Africa, 
Latin America, and the Middle East, leading to a total of about 550 million obese adults being treated 
globally (just under 40 percent of the global adult obese population). 

In this scenario, the resulting market size would be $280 billion in 2040, with many patients taking 
the drugs at a lower cost. A number of other assumptions would also need to be true to achieve 
this market size: manufacturers would need to scale up massively to produce doses for 550 million 
patients a year globally, and they would need to remove the current production bottleneck in the 
fill-finish production step. In addition, competition would have to be sufficiently intense to bring 
down the price from today’s level, healthcare payers worldwide would have to recognize the drugs’ 
benefits and offer coverage, side effects would have to be mild enough to promote widespread 
adherence, and there would have to be widespread recognition from patients and doctors that 
obesity is a treatable condition.

The lower range of scenarios assumes that the blended price of obesity therapies (blended across 
all branded and generic options) in the United States in 2040 would fall, but not as low as $500 a 
year per patient. Instead, the scenario assumes a price of $2,500 a year per patient, similar to the 
average annual cost of current diabetes medications, while each patient in most other regions would 
pay about $900 per year for the same treatment.346 This also assumes that 57 percent of the global 
obese population is diagnosed347 and that of those diagnosed, about 20 percent of obese patients in 
North America and Europe would take these drugs, while about 10 percent of those diagnosed would 
take them in the rest of the world.348

Altogether, these numbers point to a total global patient population of about 100 million obese 
adults (just under 7 percent of the global adult obese population) using the drugs. In this scenario, 
the market size for obesity drugs in 2040 could be $120 billion, growing at a 9 percent CAGR from 
today. The higher price and lower volume assumptions in this scenario could be a result of some 
combination of the following four contributing factors, among others:

 — Continued challenges prolong current production bottlenecks. 

 — There is no widely available small-molecule oral pill. 

 — Some patients end treatment as a result of unpleasant side effects and other causes. 

 — Healthcare payers are willing to offer some coverage, but not at the same rate as in the lower 

price scenario.

While $120 billion to $280 billion in revenues would require sustained growth and massive increases 
in patient access, these drugs could prove a relatively cost-effective intervention in the context of 
global pharmaceutical spending considering their potential healthcare impact. Global spending on 
drugs reached $1.48 trillion in 2022 and is forecast to increase 7 percent a year until 2028.349 While 
we cannot know the exact trajectory of the drug market in the future, if this growth rate continues 
through 2040, $120 billion to $280 billion of obesity drugs would reflect less than 5 percent of global 
pharmaceutical spending, less than the relative market size of oncology drugs today (currently about 
12 percent). 

Dynamism
The introduction of new obesity drug therapies has already begun to shift market share toward the 
first movers in the space while simultaneously pushing incumbents in other pharma submarkets to 
develop their own obesity therapies. This new area of competition could reset the S-curve for obesity 
treatments and offer incentives to new players to enter the field.

The early commercial success of GLP-1s is triggering escalatory dynamics as pharma majors 
invest in R&D to develop the next generation of branded drugs. As with other drugs, GLP-1s require 
substantial up-front investment due to unpredictably long development and approval timelines. Given 
the likelihood of increased pricing pressures once generics are introduced, current players will likely 
be encouraged to develop new branded drug therapies with higher efficacy, fewer side effects, or 
less intrusive ingestion methods—for example, oral solids replacing injectables. 

However, with more than six applications already filed for generic semaglutide, a large number of 
generics producers will likely emerge after Novo Nordisk loses exclusivity of its first-to-market 
compound by the early 2030s in major markets such as the United States and Europe. That milestone 
would drive the market toward relative fragmentation. While pharmaceutical companies may try to 
develop second- or third-generation branded obesity treatments, the drugs would have to show 
superior performance to be preferable to low-cost generics with clinical profiles similar to those 
of existing options. And even if these new second-generation drugs succeed in the market, the 
introduction of generics based on the first-generation drugs could exert considerable downward 
pricing pressure on the market.

The discovery of step-change treatments for other chronic illnesses would likely set off a similar 
escalation of R&D investment, with major pharmaceutical companies entering the arena, followed 
by fragmentation with the entry of generics producers. For example, 1,600 treatments and vaccines 
for cancer were in development in 2023, a more than twofold increase from 2014.350 As the global 
burden of chronic diseases becomes increasingly significant, the potential impact of pharmaceutical 
solutions increases, too.

Swing factors
 — Researchers are investigating whether GLP-1-based therapies can be used to treat other  
chronic diseases. If that research proves successful, how much more widespread could  
GLP-1 treatments become?

 — As the prevalence of obesity increases globally, what impact might the global recognition of 
obesity as a disease by medical stakeholders (governments, public health agencies, payers,  
and R&D companies) have on the market in price and volume?

 — The convenience and tolerability of the drugs likely will have a large impact on their uptake.  

Can research identify options for obesity treatments that are more convenient and have fewer 
side effects?

 — If considering the broader set of chronic conditions that make up a large share of the healthcare 

burden, what could be the impact of developing similarly efficacious therapies for other  
chronic conditions?

18. Nuclear fission  
power plants

The nuclear fission power plant industry dates to the 1950s. It encompasses the construction of 
power plants that leverage nuclear fission to produce energy, including traditional large-scale 
reactors (LSRs) as well as small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors, which are more recent 
technological advancements. Nuclear fission works by splitting an atom into two smaller atoms, 
releasing energy in the process. Fuel sources for nuclear fission today include uranium-235, 
plutonium-239, and thorium-232 isotopes. Nuclear power can generate one million times more 
energy than fossil fuels per mass. Today, nuclear fission reactors are a leading source of electricity 
generated without emissions of greenhouse gases.351

As the demand for energy rises with economic development, electricity generation is projected to 
roughly double from 2022 to 2040.352 In addition, with efforts to decarbonize, the energy mix could 
significantly change as energy users switch to low-emissions sources from emissions-intensive 
sources such as coal and other fossil fuels. Nuclear power has high potential to fill these energy needs. 
It is already able to provide stable baseload electricity to the grid, unlike solar, which cannot produce 
energy at night, and wind, whose generation depends on variable weather patterns. Furthermore, the 
rapid expansion of solar and wind power could slow down because of factors such as the scarcity of 
land for solar and wind farms, the time that it takes to build the necessary transmission infrastructure, 
and the difficulty of scaling up electricity-storage capacity quickly enough.

Both private investors and governments in many markets are driving momentum in support of 
the expansion of nuclear generation. Investors are showing interest, even though the industry 
has high capital costs and investments take a long time to produce returns. Global venture 
investment funding of nuclear companies shot up from $60 million in 2018 to $390 million in 2022. 
Companies are also facing higher electricity demand caused by the increasing prevalence of 
artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing, alongside sustainability goals. Nuclear power offers 
a potential solution to meet these needs. For example, Microsoft is considering nuclear energy to 
power its AI data center operations.353

Several countries are starting new nuclear programs or expanding existing ones. The US Department 
of Energy has awarded about $3 billion to license, build, and demonstrate two next-generation 
plants, and the Inflation Reduction Act provides either an investment tax credit of up to 50 percent 
or a production tax credit of up to $36 per MWh for the first ten years of a new plant’s operation. In 
2022, the United Kingdom announced a $150 million fund to support new nuclear projects.354 South 
Korea plans to increase the share of nuclear power in the country’s energy mix to 30 percent or more 
by 2030.355 In Finland, after the Olkiluouto 3 nuclear plant went into operation, the contribution of 
nuclear power to total electricity generation increased from 33 percent in 2021 to more than 40 
percent in 2023.356 Adding to this momentum, 25 countries collectively made commitments at the 
COP28 climate summit in 2023 to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050.357

Growth
Nuclear fission’s growth may depend on decreasing the capital expenditures and time needed 
to build large reactors and SMRs as technology advances. Growth could also depend on the 
decarbonization paths followed by countries, which will each require varying amounts of the 
emissions-free “firm” energy production that nuclear power can provide.358 The industry’s revenues 
are projected to grow from $18 billion in 2022 to $65 billion by 2040 in a lower-range scenario and

to $150 billion by 2040 in a higher-range scenario, a 7 to 13 percent CAGR. A further breakthrough 
scenario could be possible if the cost of building nuclear drops significantly, leading to a market 
size of $400 billion in 2040, a 19 percent CAGR from 2022. These figures include revenues for 
the builders of nuclear fission power plants and do not include the cost of operations. The revenue 
estimates factor in existing operational capacity net of suspended and permanently shut-down 
facilities, capacity under construction, and countries’ commitments to achieving net-zero emissions 
by 2050.

In the overall energy system, global electricity generation in 2022 was 27,000 TWh. Ten percent of 
that output was from nuclear sources, about 30 percent came from other lower-emissions sources, 
such as solar and wind, and the remaining 60 percent was from higher-emissions sources, such 
as coal and natural gas. In our estimates, nuclear power could generate between 8 and 19 percent 
of global electricity by 2040.359 Under a breakthrough scenario we modeled in which capital 
expenditure per megawatt significantly drops, nuclear power could generate up to 43 percent of 
global electricity. Historical precedent also suggests that nuclear power could play a larger role in 
the energy mix than the 10 percent it provides today. Nuclear power underwent a construction boom 
from the 1970s to the early 1990s, when its share of total power generation globally increased from  
2 to 18 percent.360

The contribution of nuclear power to the energy mix depends on three factors: building costs, 
whether solar and wind technologies become uninterrupted based on advances in storage and 
transmission, and the decarbonization scenario. First, capital expenditure for plant construction 
is a main driver of energy cost for nuclear power. Historically, the price ranged from a lower end of 
$2 million to $3 million per megawatt—for the P4 reactors built in France in 1984 and the APR-1400 
reactor built in South Korea in 2010—to a higher end of $5 million to $13 million per megawatt for 
reactors built in the United States.361

As more countries build nuclear power plants and the global market grows, learning-curve efficiencies 
could push capital expenditure lower for large reactors, SMRs, and microreactors. For example, the 
Barakah nuclear plant in the United Arab Emirates achieved a 32 percent reduction in cost with each 
doubling of deployment volume.362 Additional factors specific to LSRs, SMRs, and microreactors also 
apply. For example, SMRs and microreactors that can be assembled in factories from prefabricated 
components benefit from being constructed out of small, repeatable, and standardized components at 
scale, lowering production costs. Furthermore, SMR and microreactor construction involves repeating 
many smaller construction projects rather than managing one much larger project, enabling quicker 
learning iterations. The adoption and standardization of SMR and microreactor technology could also 
reduce costs, affecting the number of nuclear power plants that would be built. In the case of LSRs, 
improved economies of scale might drive long-term cost-effectiveness. 

Second, the amount of firm power363 required by a lower-emissions grid is an important factor. A 
less carbon-intensive grid that relies more heavily on renewables would also need a baseline of firm 
power to balance out energy demand and ensure reliable service. Currently, nuclear technology and 
hydropower are the only proven options for providing emissions-free firm energy production. Looking 
ahead, advancements in long-duration storage for solar and wind, geothermal energy, and carbon 
capture of emissions from fossil fuel power sources like natural gas could offer potential alternatives 
for supplying emissions-free firm power. Technology advancements in these sources will affect their 
cost, performance, and public acceptance compared with nuclear power, and thus affect the future 
energy mix.

Finally, the decarbonization path that countries choose significantly affects electricity demand, 
generation levels, and the energy mix because decarbonization involves the electrification of major 
energy use categories such as industrial processes, transportation, and heating and cooling. Under 
current policies, which may not be sufficient to achieve net zero, electricity generation is projected to

reach 50,000 TWH by 2040. In a scenario with more targeted policies and increased commitments, 
including from new adopters of nuclear power, electricity generation could reach 59,000 TWh.364

Higher-range and lower-range scenarios incorporating different assumptions for the three factors 
above yielded the market size and rationales illustrated in the exhibit above.

In the lower-growth scenario, industry revenues would expand from $18 billion in 2022 to $65 billion 
in 2040 at a CAGR of 8 percent. The capital expenditure per megawatt underlying this range falls at 
the higher end of estimates, between $6 million and $8 million. Under the scenario, 10 GW of capacity 
is constructed annually. This pace of construction assumes a mix of the following assumptions: that 
all nuclear plants already under construction or planned to be built by 2040 will be completed, that 
countries will maintain a similar pace of construction, and that countries follow through on some or all 
of their commitments to net zero. 

This scenario also involves building up to eight large reactors or 31 small reactors annually, bringing 
nuclear capacity to 550 GW or 5,000 TWh by 2040. In that case, nuclear power could generate 
between 8 and 11 percent of global electricity, depending on the total energy produced under 
different decarbonization scenarios, similar to the 10 percent share it generates today.365

In the higher-growth scenario, industry revenues would expand from $18 billion in 2022 to $150 
billion in 2040 at a CAGR of 13 percent. The capital expenditure per megawatt in this scenario is 
below the figure for the lower-growth scenario and falls between $4 million and $6 million. This 
scenario assumes that 30 GW of capacity is constructed annually. Growth hinges on favorable 
developments of the three factors mentioned earlier: the adoption of newer technologies such as 
SMRs to reduce costs and enhance safety, increased reliance on nuclear power as a substantial 
source of firm power compared with alternatives, and more ambitious decarbonization goals through 
support from both the public and governments. 

Moreover, this scenario relies on sustained commitment from countries deeply engaged in nuclear 
power, particularly China, which plans to build 150 new nuclear reactors by 2035. It has 27 under 
construction, far exceeding Russia, the second-largest builder, which currently has only four 
reactors under construction.366 The scenario also anticipates increased adoption of nuclear power by 
countries with minimal current capacity. It involves building as many as 26 large reactors or 100 small 
reactors annually, bringing nuclear capacity to 940 GW or 8,000 TWh by 2040. If those conditions 
are met, nuclear power could generate between 14 and 19 percent of global electricity, depending on 
the total energy produced under different decarbonization scenarios.367

That scenario aligns with the historic peak of 30 GW added per year in the 1980s. By contrast, a 
breakthrough scenario could produce even faster growth. For example, capital expenditure per 
megawatt could decrease significantly, possibly to less than $4 million per megawatt and closer to 
the $2 million to $3 million per megawatt cost of South Korea’s APR-1400 reactor, making nuclear 
power cost-effective compared with other energy sources. Other emissions-free energy sources 
could fall short in supplying and distributing enough electricity at the right time to meet demand. 
There could be continued momentum in achieving global commitments for decarbonization by 2050. 
Nuclear energy could take on a larger role in off-grid power, heat, desalination, and AI data centers. 

Our breakthrough scenario could lead to a market size of $400 billion by 2040, and a 19 percent 
CAGR from 2022. This scenario entails the addition of 100 GW added per year and involves building 
as many as 83 large reactors or 330 small reactors per year, resulting in 2,200 GW of nuclear energy 
capacity or 19,000 TWh by 2040. In this scenario, nuclear power could generate between 33 and 43 
percent of global electricity, depending on the total energy produced under different decarbonization 
scenarios. While this would represent a historically large share of the mix for nuclear power globally, 
the share in some countries, such as Finland, France, and Switzerland, already exceeds 30 percent.368

Other factors influencing the growth of nuclear power include readiness of the supply chain to 
secure fuel sources and meet stringent standards for multiple nuclear components, availability of 
labor for plant construction, complexities in construction that may cause delays, and the ability to 
deal with nuclear waste. The amount of waste generated through nuclear power generation is small, 
but it remains highly radioactive; the nuclear industry has so far been successful in managing this 
issue. Government support can also affect growth through regulations and subsidies. The current 
regulatory framework applies to large reactors. The higher range of scenarios assumes that these 
regulations are adjusted to enable SMR adoption. Governments have historically used public 
subsidies to pursue nuclear power.

Dynamism 
The nuclear fission power plant industry has a few well-established players with large market shares, 
although new entrants are making inroads with new technologies. The high R&D spending required 
for the design and construction of nuclear reactors, along with strict regulatory and licensing 
requirements, favors large companies with big market shares, such as Hitachi, Westinghouse, and 
China’s State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation. At the moment, there are about 120 owners 
and 90 operators of nuclear power plants globally. Although the market for reactors is international,

nuclear power players tend to build only in countries to which they have geopolitical ties. Those 
factors limit the extent to which market share could shift. However, there is potential for larger players 
to extend to developing economies, particularly countries without major nuclear-energy companies.

The lengthy development process of next-generation nuclear fission power plant technology might 
also favor existing companies with large R&D budgets. New technologies require a long R&D phase 
to build experimental “lab-scale” reactors that prove scientific feasibility. Then companies must 
demonstrate a small-scale proof-of-concept reactor with sufficient stability of design. After these 
rounds of testing, the companies need to build the full-scale reactor to validate performance before 
full commercial deployment.

Nonetheless, newer entrants are developing the technology and could further scale it or sell it to 
utility companies. For example, TerraPower raised $830 million in late-stage venture capital (VC) 
funding in 2022.369 That was supplemented by more than $2 billion from the US Department of 
Energy to build a nuclear power plant near a retired coal facility in Wyoming.370 In Sweden, LeadCold 
is developing a Gen IV microreactor and received $2 million in late-stage VC funding, with an 
additional $11 million from the Swedish Energy Agency. Both companies have plans for plant site 
deployment in the late 2020s or early 2030s. Companies that are able to successfully develop newer 
technologies with advantages such as lower production costs and enhanced safety will likely have 
a significant first-mover advantage in capturing market share and could collect higher returns as 
front-runners in commercializing the technology. However, larger legacy players are likely to retain 
significant market presence given their scale, existing development contracts, and experience with 
government funding.

Swing factors
 — How will global energy demand shift in the future as a result of policies related to emissions and 

other factors? 

 — How might technological advancements such as long-duration storage for solar and wind, 

geothermal energy, and carbon capture of fossil fuel power sources such as natural gas affect 
firm power supply and the uptake of nuclear power? 

 — How fast might companies accelerate learning-curve efficiencies in nuclear reactor construction 
to reduce capital expenditure for nuclear plants, and how sensitive would demand be to such 
price shifts?

 — How much will governments support R&D and construction for nuclear power compared with 

other renewable energy sources? How will this backing vary across countries based on broader 
industrial policy? How might public perceptions about the safety of nuclear power evolve and 
affect public and government support for nuclear power?

 — How active will large-scale off-takers—such as data-center hyperscalers and high process-

heat demand manufacturers, for example—become in the funding, construction, and potential 
ownership of new nuclear power plants?

In this report we use the word “markets” and phrases 
including the word “market,” such as “market 
segment” and “market niche.” We may also show 
various calculations of “market shares.” In doing so, 
we are referring to various groups of products sold 
globally or in a particular region that we think are 
useful to consider together. We do not intend to use 
the word “market” in any formal or legal sense.
2   Some industry classifications, such as software or 
telecommunications, map one-to-one to potential 
arenas. However, competitive battles happened 
either within or across more established industry 
classifications, so they can sometimes be averaged 
out (for example, EVs within the automotive sector). 
Moreover, more than 300 companies operate in 
multiple industries (such as Amazon in e-commerce 
and cloud) but tend to be placed in a single industry 
index. To address this, we created a segmentation 
of 57 distinct industries and categorized the world’s 
top 3,000 companies from 2005 to 2020 within 
these segments. This approach involved splitting the 
revenues of 300 very large multi-industry companies 
into their respective segments.
These numbers cover only the e-commerce 
component of Amazon’s valuation.

LG closed its smartphone business in 2021.
5   We conducted the Exhibit 5 analysis for 2005–19 
to isolate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
economic profit. We also conducted the analysis for 
2005–20, and the results are similar, with all arenas 
improving their ranking over the time period.

11 As noted, we started from a list of the world’s 3,000 

largest companies. In this case, of the 29 companies 
we identified in the consumer internet industry, 16 
either did not exist or did not report any market cap 
in 2005.

12  Because many companies fit into multiple arenas, 
the market caps listed here are weighted to reflect 
the splitting of market cap across multiple lines of 
business or business units. For example, the largest 
market cap would be $2.3 trillion if we counted Apple 
as one unit rather than dividing it, as we have done, 
into computing hardware and consumer electronics. 
See the technical appendix for more detail on our 
weighting methodology.

The distinction between these two categories is not 
rigid as in both cases new products and services are 
displacing old ones, but it is a qualitatively different 
shift in the latter case.

22  This highlights the fact that the potion is not 

definitional for an arena but rather a falsifiable theory 
about what creates arenas, supported by evidence in 
almost every case, but to varying degrees.

27  We use after-tax profit margins to refer to net 

operating profit less adjusted taxes (NOPLAT). The 
margins we considered were based on observed 
NOPLAT margins in industries most similar to our 
potential future arenas. In some instances, the 
benchmarks are clear, as in software, e-commerce, 
and pharmaceuticals (for the drugs for obesity 
and related conditions arena). In other instances, 
we considered a wide range of industries given 
the nascency of the potential future arenas. For 
example, modular construction took into account the 
construction engineering, building materials, and 
software industries, as well as NOPLAT margins of 
existing modular construction players.

on an on-demand basis on personalized routes. 
Robo-shuttles generally transport 20 or more 
passengers on predetermined routes with  
scheduled stops.

driving automation. For more information, see

151  We did so because the competitive arena here 
is defined by the players offering a shared 
mobility service, rather than a product, so private 
autonomous vehicles constitute a different industry. 
We did not include private autonomous vehicles in 
our short list of arenas because there is uncertainty 
over whether it will emerge as a distinct industry 
from automotive with new players or as a feature that 
automotive players would add to their products. For

162  Carmakers’ overall vehicle sales through 2040  

are projected to stay consistent with their historical 
trajectory. That is, demand for SAVs would replace 
demand for other cars rather than driving up  
total demand. However, automakers may be  
able to benefit from the trend toward autonomous 
vehicles if they become preferred partners of 
SAV service providers or if they offer superior 
autonomous driving capabilities in people’s 
personal vehicles.

Chapter 1

Data set
The companies we analyzed were selected from more than 20,000 companies tracked in the 
McKinsey Value Intelligence database, applying the following filters:

 —  Data quality: Data at least included detailed reporting of income statement and balance sheet. 

 —  Parent companies only: No double counting of subsidiaries.

 —  Minimum market cap: $3.5 billion in 2005 or $5 billion in 2020.  

We augmented this initial database to account for IPOs and other M&A activities from 2005 to 2020, 
based on Capital IQ data. Seventy private companies with at least $5 billion in valuation as of 2020 
were also included, along with their 2005 data.

For companies with missing market cap values for 2005, we looked at their 2020 market-cap-to-
revenue multiples and applied this multiple to the companies’ 2005 revenues to approximate 2005 
market caps. All market cap numbers were measured at the end of the relevant calendar year.

This data set yielded 2,970 unique companies. Those that operated in several industries were split 
into multiple discrete entries. For example, Microsoft was split into four entries: cloud services, 
consumer electronics, consumer internet, and software. Amazon was split into two: cloud services 
and e-commerce. Publicly available data such as annual reports and press releases was used to 
calculate how to split these companies. This yielded a subset of 150 companies. We used the revenue 
split of individual business segments as the baseline to calculate the market cap split adjusted by the 
industry’s multiple. 

To illustrate our process with a hypothetical example, Theta Company has operations in both 
consumer electronics and cloud services. In this scenario, the consumer electronics segment 
generates $8,000 of revenue, and the hypothetical assumes that the industry has an average 
market-cap-to-revenue multiple of two. In cloud services, Theta has $2,000 in revenues, and the 
hypothetical assumes that the industry has an average market-cap-to-revenue multiple of eight. 
By multiplying the revenues and multiples, we find that Theta’s market cap split between consumer 
electronics and cloud services is 50 percent each. We can then multiply Theta’s market cap for 
the year by 50 percent to produce its market cap for each industry. For this model, each company-
industry combination was treated as a unique data point. The final count of data points was 3,135.

The data set encompassed 57 different industries. Twelve of these were the current-era arenas we 
identified. These 57 industries were defined by starting with the McKinsey Value Intelligence data 
set, which as of 2023 contains 29 level two subindustries defined by McKinsey Industry Classification 
(MIC). These MIC subindustries differ from the standard Global Industrial Classifications (GIC) 
system by having three levels of granularity (13 level one industries, 29 level two subindustries, 
and 124 level three subindustries) compared with GIC’s four levels (11 sectors, 25 industry groups, 
74 industries, and 163 subindustries). Some of these MIC industries were then split into more granular 
industry definitions, depending on the company. These definitions were used in our final data set. 
For example, the MIC industry definition would have classified Tesla as belonging to the automotive 
and assembly industry. In our data set, companies in the automotive and assembly industry were 
classified as automotives, electric vehicles, or industrial equipment. As a result, Tesla was mapped

into electric vehicles instead of into a broader automotive and assembly industry. Some companies 
may have had a different MIC level two classification but were folded into the same industry group 
(for example, United Airlines was in the MIC level two air and travel classification, while Aéroports de 
Paris was in MIC level two transport and infrastructure, but they both are mapped to our air services 
industry). We conducted this kind of reclassification in six cases: consumer durables, air services, 
healthcare, consumer internet, freight and logistics, and information-enabled business services. 

Exhibit A1 sets out the reclassification of companies from their MIC level two designations 
(29 definitions as of 2023) to their final industry designations.1

Computing growth rates and shuffle rates
The growth rate measures the increase in the overall revenue or market capitalization share of an 
industry. For example, the industry with the highest revenue growth rate in the period we considered 
was e-commerce, which had a 0.08 percent share in 2005 and a 2.40 percent share in 2020, an 
increase of 2.32 percentage points—the growth rate metric for e-commerce. The industry with the 
lowest revenue growth rate was oil and gas, with a 5.48 percentage-point decrease. E-commerce 
had the highest growth rate for market cap, at 3.82 percentage points. Retail and commercial banks 
had the lowest growth rate for market cap, at −6.45 percentage points.

A negative growth rate did not necessarily mean that an industry was shrinking, but rather that its 
shares of the total revenues in our database had decreased. Oil and gas registered revenue growth 
from 2005 to 2020, for example, but other industries outpaced it. Similarly, retail and commercial 
banks increased their market cap from 2005 to 2020 but grew at a slower pace than other industries.

The relevant formulas are as follows:

The shuffle rate measures the change in players’ market shares within an industry. An example 
appears in chapter 1, in the sidebar “Industry dynamism measured by share shifts.” To compute the 
shuffle rate of a given industry, we started with the percentage-point changes in revenue or market 
cap share of each player from 2005 to 2020. We then added up all the positive percentage-point 
changes for each player.

For example, cloud services had the highest revenue shuffle rate at 87 percentage points, while 
aerospace and defense had the lowest revenue shuffle rate at 15 percentage points. In market cap 
shuffle rate, electric vehicles had the highest at 97 percentage points, while aerospace and defense 
had the lowest at 28 percentage points.

The formulas appear below:

One can also think of the growth rate as a metric that measures change across industries, while the 
shuffle rate measures change within industries.

In this report, we showed combined industry shuffle rates and industry share growth rates of market 
capitalization and revenue as bubble charts. Exhibits A2 and A3 are individual charts for each of the 
four dimensions relevant to demonstrating the arenas’ growth and dynamism.

Selection of the 12 arenas of today
Three criteria were used in selecting the 12 current arenas: a high growth rate, a high shuffle rate, and 
a minimum market cap in 2020.

We first ranked the 57 industries by their growth rates and shuffle rates for both revenue and market 
cap, with one the highest and 57 the lowest. We then created a composite score by adding the 
four ranks of each industry—their growth and shuffle rates for both revenues and market cap. In 
theory, this would mean that if an industry ranked the highest in growth rate and shuffle rate for both 
revenues and market cap, it would have a score of one for all four metrics, for a total composite score 
of four. By contrast, if the industry ranked the lowest for all four metrics, or a score of 57 for each, it 
would have a total composite score of 228. 

We filtered out arenas with market capitalization of less than $800 billion in 2020.

Exhibit A4 lists the top 20 industries by composite scores.

The 12 industries with the lowest composite scores (indicating highest growth and shuffle rates) and a 
market capitalization of at least $800 billion in 2020 made up our final list of 12 current arenas.

Other analyses
GDP contribution analysis. We first identified the overall industry sizes of the 12 arenas in 2005 
and 2020. This was required as the revenues presented in chapter 1 only include companies in the 
analyzed sample, and hence represent only a subset of the total industry. Overall industry sizes 
were obtained from McKinsey databases, such as the Global Payments Map, as well as third-
party information sources, such as Statista . For instances where 2005 data was unavailable, the 
respective arena 2005–20 CAGR was applied to 2020 data to determine the 2005 industry size by 
working backward. As a result, the overall revenue size of the 12 arenas is estimated at $2.8 trillion in 
2005 and $13.4 trillion in 2020.

To estimate the GDP contribution of the 12 arenas, we first tried to identify the appropriate ratio to apply 
to revenues, to arrive at gross value added (the “ratio”). We used data from the US Bureau of Economic 
Analysis (BEA), which contains value-added and gross-output data from 58 industries. We calculated 
the ratio between value added and gross output across these 58 industries from 2005 to 2020.

We then mapped each of the 12 arenas with the most closely linked BEA industries and identified the 
ratio most appropriate for each arena. For instance, the consumer electronics arena was mapped to 
the BEA industry labeled “computer and electronic products.” This industry had an average ratio of 
0.66 from 2005 to 2020. The industrial electronics arena was mapped to the BEA industry labeled 
“machinery,” which had an average ratio of 0.38. We also looked at the variances of the ratios across 
years. While some industries (such as motion picture and sound recording) showed volatility, those 
contributed a relatively small proportion of the sample. 

We then applied the respective ratios to each of the 12 overall arena industry sizes to identify 
the estimated GDP equivalent of arenas. When compared with GDP, this estimated arena GDP 
contribution came to $1.6 trillion in 2005 and $7.7 trillion in 2020.

Sensitivity analysis. To test for sensitivity, we replicated analyses of the six key metrics that 
differentiated arenas from other industries listed in chapter 1 to account for significant global 
events such as the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. For 
example, we looked at the movements in economic profit and revenue and market cap growth rates 
from 2005 to 2019 (instead of 2020), which resulted in the same outcomes. The takeaways from all 
analyses held across all of these checks.

R&D analysis. Company reported R&D expenses were both incomplete and inconsistent at the 
firm level within the top 3,000 companies’ databases. We instead used publicly available data. We 
used publicly available data from the US National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 
specifically its Business Enterprise Research and Development (BERD) Survey. We took the total 
domestic US private-sector spending on R&D in 2005 and 2020 at the most granular level possible. 
This resulted in 54 different industries defined by the BERD survey. We mapped these 54 industries 
as either arenas (and arena-adjacent) or non-arenas. For example, we mapped an industry named 
“software publishers” in the BERD survey to an arena (software). For large industries such as 
pharmaceuticals and medicines, we divided these data points into two categories: pharmaceuticals 
(not an arena) and biopharmaceuticals (an arena). The proportion of this split was based on the 
revenues of these two industries as listed in the main McKinsey Value Intelligence data set. The 
same logic was used to calculate R&D to revenue ratios for arenas and non-arenas, using publicly 
available data from the same source on 2020 R&D intensity. R&D intensity is defined as the cost of 
US spending on R&D divided by US net sales of companies that performed or funded R&D.

Chapter 2

Spawning giants analysis. To analyze the share of total market cap of large market cap companies 
within arenas and non-arenas, we have used the same McKinsey Value Intelligence company-level 
data as was used to identify arenas of today. Companies were grouped by market cap size according 
to the following criteria: i) market cap lower than $50 billion; ii) market cap between $50 billion and 
$200 billion; iii) market cap equal to or larger than $200 billion. To get to the percentage share of 
these companies in arenas and non-arenas, we divided the number of companies in each of these 
three market cap size categories by the total number of companies in arenas and non-arenas. To 
get to the percentage share of total arenas’ and non-arenas’ market cap held by companies in these 
three categories, we have divided the market cap value held by each of these categories by total 
arenas and non-arenas market caps.

Revenue sources by geographies analysis. To analyze the source countries of our companies’ 
revenues, we also used the McKinsey Value Intelligence database, which breaks down company 
revenues by country. We then mapped these data points individually into two groups: domestic, if the 
source country was where the company was headquartered, and international, if the revenues were 
from outside the home country. In the rare instances where the split was unavailable, we would by 
default select the revenue earned domestically.

Early markers of arenas analysis 
We used data from PitchBook to identify venture capital (VC) and IPO flows from 2003 to 2007. 
PitchBook categorizes VC and IPO flows in two ways: by industry and by vertical. PitchBook has 
215 industries and 59 verticals. A transaction is mapped to an industry and at least one vertical. 
For example, if VC flows went to a company that provides software for virtual reality gaming, the 
company would be mapped to application software (industry) and tagged to gaming (vertical) and 
virtual reality (vertical).

We mapped these 215 industries and 59 verticals to our 12 arenas to the extent possible. In a few 
instances, the industries or verticals were mapped to several arenas. For example, PitchBook 
has an entertainment software industry. This was mapped to two arenas: software, and video and 
entertainment. PitchBook also has a mobile vertical. This was mapped to two arenas: consumer 
electronics and consumer internet.

We removed instances when a transaction was counted twice because the industry-vertical 
combination was mapped to the same arena. For instance, a transaction tagged to the application 
software industry (mapped to the software arena) with an AI and machine-learning vertical (also 
mapped to the software arena) was counted only once for the software arena’s total.

However, some double counting was unavoidable when a transaction was mapped to several 
verticals mapped to different arenas. For example, if the transaction went to a company that provided 
an e-commerce application on phones, it could be tagged to three verticals: e-commerce (mapped 
to the e-commerce arena), mobile (mapped to the consumer electronics arena), and software as a 
service (mapped to the software arena). In this case, while there was no double counting within the 
three arenas mapped, the transaction was included in the totals of these three arenas. We estimated 
these instances of multiple counting of arenas at around 20 percent of the overall value; they did not 
materially change the takeaways of the analysis.

NOPLAT estimates used
Various benchmarks were used to identify the net operating profit less adjusted taxes (NOPLAT) 
margin assumptions used for chapter 3, Exhibit 14. The primary intent of using NOPLAT estimates

was to give readers an important additional layer of considerations aside from the potential revenues 
presented in the exhibit.

For most of these arenas, all three of our general approaches to benchmarking used historical 2022 
NOPLAT margins.

The first approach was used for continuing and spin-off arenas. The benchmark for these arenas 
was the originating arena. Seven arenas fell into this category: e-commerce, AI software and 
services, electric vehicles, digital ads, cloud services, semiconductors, and streaming video. We 
then adjusted our assumptions based on the 2022 NOPLAT of the originating arena, given the 
uncertainty surrounding the evolution of the economics of these arenas. For example, e-commerce 
saw a 3 percent NOPLAT in 2022 from the same data set we used in chapter 1. We then ranged 
this 3 percent and used a 2 to 5 percent assumption. Similarly, we used the NOPLAT benchmark of 
13 percent for video and audio entertainment (an originating arena) as our base assumption for the 
streaming video potential future arena. This was then ranged to 10 to 15 percent.

The second approach was for potential future arenas that were closely linked to any of the 
57 industries in our chapter 1 data set (the 57 are identified above). Seven arenas belonged to this 
category: shared autonomous vehicles, space, cybersecurity, video games, industrial and consumer 
biotech, modular construction, and future air mobility. We took all relevant industries connected to 
these potential future arenas and used the range of those numbers as our benchmark. In instances 
when only one industry was used as the benchmark, we ranged those numbers as well, in a similar 
way to the ranging we did in the first approach in the previous paragraph. For instance, aerospace 
and defense saw an 8 percent NOPLAT in 2022, which we ranged from 5 to 10 percent.

The last approach was for potential future arenas that had existing companies that could be 
reasonably used as benchmarks. We considered companies that were relatively mature, because 
their economics and margins were likely more stable than those of newer companies or start-ups. 
Four potential future arenas were in this category: batteries, drugs for obesity and related conditions, 
nuclear fission power plants, and robotics. For example, we used Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk as our 
benchmarks for drugs for obesity and related conditions.

GDP contribution analysis
To estimate the GDP contribution of the potential arenas of tomorrow in both 2022 and 2040, 
we followed the same general approach discussed above in chapter 1. We first tried to identify 
the appropriate ratio to apply to revenues to estimate value added and applied those ratios to the 
estimated arena sizes in 2022 and 2040.

We used data from the US BEA, which contains value-added and gross-output data from 
58 industries. We then mapped the 18 arenas of tomorrow with the most closely linked BEA 
industries. For instance, the modular construction arena was mapped to the “construction” industry, 
and the cybersecurity arena was mapped to the “computer systems design and related services” 
industry. These mappings were then matched with the respective value-added to gross-output ratios 
from 2005 to 2020, which were mostly stable. These ratios were then multiplied on the respective 
low and high case revenue estimates for each of the 18 arenas. This resulted in an estimated total 
GDP equivalent of $4.2 trillion in 2022 and $16.4 trillion to $26.9 trillion for the low and high cases, 
respectively, in 2040.

To estimate overall GDP, we used GDP data from the World Bank for 2022 as our starting point for 
global GDP. The growth rate we used was 2.85 percent, the rate estimated by the OECD for OECD 
and G-20 countries from 2020 to 2040.
