Introduction

by Michael Chui, Roger Roberts, and Lareina Yee

Technology continues to be a primary catalyst for change in the 
world. Technology advances give businesses, governments, and 
social-sector institutions more possibilities to lift their productivity, 
invent or reinvent offerings, and contribute to humanity’s well-
being. And while it remains difficult to predict how technology 
trends will play out, executives can plan ahead better by tracking 
the development of new technologies, anticipating how 
companies might use them, and understanding the factors that 
affect innovation and adoption.

To that end, we have worked with the internal and external 
experts on the McKinsey Technology Council to identify and 
interpret 14 of the most significant technology trends unfolding 
today (see sidebar “About the McKinsey Technology Council”). 
This study builds on the trend research we shared last year, 
adding fresh data and deeper analysis to provide a more granular 
assessment of trends in two thematic groups: Silicon Age, which 
encompasses digital and IT technologies, and Engineering 
Tomorrow, which encompasses physical technologies in 
domains such as energy and mobility.

Our analysis examines such tangible, quantitative factors as 
investment, research activity, and news coverage to gauge the 
momentum of each trend. We also conducted dozens of 
interviews and performed hundreds of hours of research to learn 
which industries are apt to benefit most as they absorb these 
technologies. And, recognizing that trends can speed up, slow 
down, or change course, we examined the uncertainties and 
questions surrounding each trend. 

This research overview, an accompanying online interactive, and 
a set of 14 in-depth trend profiles lay out these considerations in 
more detail so that executives can better comprehend how the 
individual trends are developing and interacting, and what these 
developments might mean for their organizations. Looking across 
the trends, we also arrived at some general observations that 
leaders might find instructive.

New dynamics

First, several trends that are based on proven and mature 
technologies—namely applied AI, advanced connectivity, future 
of bioengineering, and cloud and edge computing—score more 
highly on quantitative measures of innovation, interest, and 
investment than trends based on technologies that are still in the 
early stages of development. These trends also tend to have 
viable applications in more industries, which places them closer 
to a state of mainstream adoption than other trends (Exhibit 1).

The next noteworthy group consists of trends that are closely 
aligned with sustainability priorities. These trends—which we call 
future of clean energy, future of sustainable consumption, and 
future of mobility—display increasing levels of innovation, 
interest, and investment. Indeed, of all the 14 trends we studied, 
the clean-energy and mobility trends attracted the most 
investment. They have also emerged as significant across 
multiple industries.

Outside the first two major categories, newer and less-proven 
digital tools power a set of emerging trends: industrializing 
machine learning, immersive-reality technologies, trust

architectures and digital identity, next-generation software 
development, and quantum technologies. These trends could 
have major benefits for businesses. For example, industrializing 
machine learning (ML) can shorten the production time frame for 
ML applications by 90 percent. But much work must be done to 
develop, refine, and commercialize the technologies that 
underpin these trends. As a result, it’s unclear how long it will 
take for these trends to be adopted in multiple sectors, let alone 
to realize the potential seen by proponents.

About the McKinsey Technology Council

Technology is changing everything in our work and home lives. 
We launched the McKinsey Technology Council to help 
understand what is coming and how it will affect us all—taking a 
“look around the corner” toward the futures that technology 
change can unlock as well as the tough questions it raises.

We will look at a spectrum of technologies, from computing to 
biology, and their applications across all sectors, from mining to 
entertainment. We look at the science, how it translates into 
engineering, and when it will accelerate to impact—at scale, and 
around the world. We are doing this with a diverse group of more 
than 50 senior leaders in McKinsey, who come from a wide range 
of science and technology backgrounds, and orchestrating 
exchanges between them and dozens of leading scientists, 
entrepreneurs, founders, and researchers who are leading 
pathbreaking work in their fields.

Introduction (continued)

Despite the uncertainty of these newer trends, it’s apparent that 
industries are broadly exposed to changes resulting from 
technological innovation and the diffusion of new technology-
enabled business practices. When we looked at how frequently 
news reports mentioned companies in 20 sectors alongside 
different trends, we found that most of these sectors display a 
meaningful association with five or more trends. The mature and 
sustainability-focused trends described above exhibit a close 
connection with multiple industries. Several nascent trends also 
show a moderately close connection with many industries. 
Overall, we see that press coverage connects the automotive, 
manufacturing, telecommunications, and technology sectors 
closely to at least one trend and moderately to several others 
(Exhibit 2). We plan to explore the effects that technology trends 
are having, and could have, on sectors in more depth over the 
coming months. (For more about how we performed this work, 
please see the sidebar “Research methodology.”)

Looking ahead

We expect changes like these will accelerate and intensify in the 
years to come, much as they have during the roughly three 
decades since the start of the internet revolution. The changes 
will not only alter the competitive landscape but also exert ever-
more powerful effects on society: reshaping markets, boosting 
productivity, spurring economic growth, and enhancing lives 
and livelihoods.

When we look at these trends, what impresses us more than 
anything else is the massive effect that technology will have on 
every sector. The next few decades promise to be a time in 
which technologies progress ever-more quickly from science to 
engineering to impact—at scale, and around the world. We also 
expect to see the multiplying effect of “combinatorial innovation,” 
as different technologies come together in creative ways. For 
example, this is happening now as organizations combine 
different technologies to create the metaverse and the many 
layers that make it up.

Informed by our colleagues and the members of the McKinsey 
Technology Council, we intend to publish more about the effects 
of technology trends on particular industries, about the efforts of 
companies to tap into technology trends, and about the ways that 
business leaders can manage the implications of technology 
trends for their strategies, operations, and talent. We invite you to 
join us in understanding how technology trends evolve and 
influence the world, and we invite you to share your feedback 
with us at: techforexecs@mckinsey.com.

Research methodology

To assess the development of each technology trend, our team 
collected data on five tangible measures of activity: search 
engine queries, news publications, patents, research 
publications, and investment. For each measure, we used a 
defined set of data sources to find occurrences of keywords 
associated with each of the 14 trends, screened those 
occurrences for valid mentions of activity, and indexed the 
resulting numbers of mentions on a 0–1 scoring scale that is 
relative to the trends studied. The innovation score combines the 
patents and research scores; the interest score combines the 
news and search scores. (While we recognize that an interest 
score can be inflated by deliberate efforts to stimulate news and 
search activity, we believe that each score fairly reflects the 
extent of discussion and debate about a given trend.) Investment 
measures the flows of funding from the capital markets into 
companies linked with the trend. Data sources for the scores 
include the following:

— Patents. Data on patent filings are sourced from Google 

Patents.

— Research. Data on research publications are sourced from 

the Lens (www.lens.org).

— News. Data on news publications are sourced from Factiva.

— Searches. Data on search engine queries are sourced from 

Google Trends.

— Investment. Data on private-market and public-market capital 

raises are sourced from PitchBook.

The associations shown on the industry heat map were derived 
by reviewing the news reports on each trend for references to 
specific companies within each of the 20 industries.

In addition, we updated the selection and definition of trends from 
last year’s study to reflect the evolution of technology trends:

— Trends added since last year’s study: industrializing machine 
learning, Web3, immersive-reality technologies, future of 
mobility, and future of space technologies

— Trends not carried over from last year’s study: next-level 

process automation and virtualization (now considered an 
implication of several trends) and next-generation materials 
(partially represented by other trends)

— Trends with adjusted definitions: next-generation software 

development (partly covered under future of programming in 
2021), trust architectures and digital identity (partly covered 
by trust architecture in 2021), future of sustainable 
consumption (disaggregated from future of clean 
technologies), and future of clean energy (disaggregated from 
future of clean technologies)

— Trends with minor changes to definition: applied AI, advanced 
connectivity (previously called future of connectivity), cloud 
and edge computing (previously called distributed 
infrastructure), quantum technologies (previously called next-
generation computing), and future of bioengineering 
(previously called Bio Revolution)

Who has successfully created impact with advanced connectivity? 

Advanced connectivity

Leading players across industries have already leveraged advanced connectivity to optimize their operations

Automotive 
and assembly

Volkswagen has implemented 5G private networks in their factory in Dresden; VW replaced wired 
connections between machinery, and now updates finished cars with over-the-air updates and connects 
unmanned vehicles with edge-cloud servers

Michelin utilized LPWAN to enable real-time inventory management in 2019; using Sigfox standards, 
Michelin was able to gain up to a 10% reduction of the on-sea inventory and a 40% increase in estimated 
time of arrival (ETA) accuracy while reducing inventory ruptures caused by exceptional events like critical 
weather conditions

Bosch equipped their first factory with a 5G private network in 2020; the network enables a range of 
advanced use cases such as autonomous transport systems at scale, an automation platform connecting 
hundreds of end points, and robots cooperating with human factory workers by adjusting movements in real 
time

Telecommuni-
cations

Verizon deployed 5G private networks in NFL stadiums to enhance spectators’ experience; these 
networks allow fans to access real-time stats and data in AR and to access a feed of up to 7 camera angles 
simultaneously via the 5G multiview offering

What are some 
topics of debate 
related to the 
trend?

Despite relative maturity, 
advanced connectivity 
technologies still spark a certain 
amount of debate regarding 
their implementation and 
perceived vs realized benefits

5G Transition

2

Extraterrestrial 
networking

3 Choosing LPWA 
standards

Advanced connectivity

Can 5G completely replace 4G LTE? What percentage of new 
networks will have high-band 5G?

 Private 5G networks are a proven technology, with many players already 

reaping their benefits

 Other technologies, such as IoT and automated guided vehicles, perform much 

better when using high-quality networks enabled by private 5G

 However, shifting from 4G LTE to private 5G may not be cost-effective for all 
players; this would depend on a player's technological aspirations and planned 
use cases

How will satellite constellations shift the balance of bandwidth 
from terrestrial connectivity to space-to-Earth connectivity?
 A few players are already piloting internet services; there are signs that 

consumer devices with LEO connectivity are on the horizon

 However, due to high capital expenditures and user costs, the business model 

and pricing will be a challenge for scaling up networks, nor can LEO 
connectivity fully serve as a substitute for terrestrial networks for all use 
cases that rely on cost-efficiency, energy consumption, or overall performance

Will certain LPWA protocols emerge as the standards for 
particular industries? Or will 5G outcompete LPWA networks 
for IoT applications?

 Depending on availability of traditional LTE networks, a player might choose 

between licensed or unlicensed cellular LPWA standards; this choice may 
also be critical when dealing with stationary and mobile devices

 LPWA standards vary in terms of bandwidth, cost, power consumption, range 

and other features; depending on the final use case for the player, some 
standards might be more appropriate than others

What are some 
topics of debate 
related to the 
trend?

1

2

Trustworthiness

What does it mean to apply trustworthy and responsible AI?

Applied AI







Potential risks and concerns increase as AI use cases expand

According to the EU Commission High-Level Expert Group on AI, responsible and trustworthy AI can be 
defined by abiding laws, incorporating ethics, and implementing technical and social robustness to 
mitigate potential harm

The commission has developed 7 requirements for AI responsibility and trust: human agency and 
oversight; societal and environmental well-being; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data 
governance; transparency; accountability; and diversity, nondiscrimination, and fairness

Explainability When is AI explainability needed?







AI explainability looks at how well we can understand an AI model. Interest in this field is rising as models 
are growing increasingly complex and high-risk use cases (eg, disease diagnosis) are being explored 

According to Stanford University Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), there are three types of AI: 
engineers’ explainability (technically explains how the AI model works), causal explainability (explains 
why a model input leads to its output), and trust-inducing explainability (information that people need to 
trust and deploy a model)

Depending on the situation, organizations may use one type of explainability, a combination of types, or 
all three types (eg, disease risk evaluation looks at all three types)

3 Applications 
prioritization

How might companies better determine which AI 
application provide the most benefit?

4 Other risks





Across industries and organizations, each applications of AI will impact different stakeholders in a unique 
way; understanding how AI impacts each stakeholder, the organization, and the ecosystem will be 
particularly important for leaders as they decide which AI applications to leverage

Understanding what impact on a use case an AI application will have will be more essential in 
prioritization decisions for leaders as they build the capabilities to deploy and monitor AI at scale

What are other areas of risk that are relevant?



According to Stanford HAI, leading areas of risk for organizations include cybersecurity, regulatory 
compliance, explainability, individual privacy, organizational reputation, and equity and fairness

 While customers, shareholders, and regulators are calling for increased scrutiny on these topics, 

subjective topics (eg, privacy, equity, and fairness) are not high strategic priorities within organizations, 
as they lack resources and capabilities to fully understand and address these concerns

will shrink data transmission 
delays and costs, as well as 
provide faster access to a 
smaller, more relevant set of 
data, which helps companies 
comply with data residency 
laws

Traditional public cloud will

performing non-time-sensitive 
computing use cases at better 
economies of scale at a 
distance from the end user

What should a leader consider 
when engaging with the trend?

Cloud and edge computing

Benefits

Risks and uncertainties

Data latency: Edge will enable use cases that had 
been challenging to implement effectively, due to data 
latency (eg, cloud gaming, smart factories, autonomous 
vehicles)

Data residency compliance: Edge will ensure 
compliance with local data residency laws necessary to 
experience the benefits of both cloud and edge

Data autonomy: Edge will ensure much more granular 
control over individual and enterprise data by limiting 
reliance on public cloud

Data security: Edge provides a security advantage 
over public cloud infrastructure, which is often 
susceptible to breaches enabled by the infrastructure-
sharing model and misconfigurations

Business model: Telecom companies and IT service 
providers need to figure out partnership, services, and 
infrastructure management approaches to unlock cost-
efficiency and avoid major cost increases resulting from 
greater technical complexity

Technical challenges: Cloud and edge involve 
managing resources over networks that require 
interoperability among a wide variety of devices and 
sensors to deliver value

Scaling hurdles: The growing number of edge nodes 
and devices will be challenging, since edge doesn’t 
benefit from the same economies of scale as traditional 
cloud computing

What are some topics 
of debate related to
the trend?

Cloud and edge computing will 
undoubtedly create tremendous 
change, but experts are still debating 
several key questions

1

Impact of edge 
computing

Will edge truly be more disruptive than cloud?





Edge is extremely flexible and supports a wide array of devices while lying in a business and regulatory sweet 
spot 

However, traditional cloud enables economies of scale that would be impossible for edge computing networks that 
require a high level of interoperability and commonality of standards currently absent in networking

Cloud and edge computing

Outlook

3

Security 
vulnerabilities

4

Energy 
consumption

Will hyperscale cloud providers win the edge race?







Public cloud providers have already created services and partnership ecosystems to provide seamless edge and 
cloud connectivity to their customers

Telecom companies with 5G-enabled MEC can choose to either contend or partner with hyperscalers 

OEMs and networking and edge service providers will be important as edge networks scale up and customers 
require custom solutions

Will the increase in number of storage and processing units lead to security 
vulnerabilities?





Keeping sensitive data at edge locations away from centralized servers helps restrict access and minimize risks in 
the event of a major attack

However, increasing the number of edge locations increases the attack vectors for malicious actors; if proper 
precautions aren’t taken, security vulnerabilities may arise 

How will cloud and edge evolve in line with the sustainable IT paradigm?







Data centers are increasingly relying on green IT measures such as sustainably sourced energy and energy-
efficient cooling systems

Edge computing further reduces overall energy requirements, as less data is transmitted across the network and 
more is processed and stored locally

However, as networks expand, the amount of critical infrastructure and number of devices, data centers, and related 
energy requirements will continue to increase

5

Meeting demand

How will cloud and edge resources cope with growing demand?





As sensor costs drop and performance increases, will new technological advances in the space be able to meet the 
growing demand for data movement and AI-enabled analytics which rely heavily on the cloud?

Increase in network capacity and performance may increase demand for cloud-based workloads and reduce the 
need for specialized edge services

Immersive-reality technologies

Spatial computing

Mixed reality (MR)

Augmented reality (AR)

Virtual reality (VR)

Software enables interaction

Graphics linked to reality

Information not linked to reality

Description

Interprets physical space and 
introduces virtual 3-D objects, 
allowing users to interact with 
environments that feature 
virtual elements

Modifies the real world through a 
device, augmenting or diminishing 
the user’s view of the world

Interacts directly with and 
overlays onto the dynamic
external reality (eg, AR glasses 
with live translation); runs 
interactively in 3-D and real time

Replaces the real world (eg, via 
headsets) by placing the user in
an entirely digital experience 
that uses external cameras/ 
sensors to render movements in 
virtual worlds

Experience

Merging of reality and MR:  
User’s sense of being immersed
is gone

Partly immersive: User holds a 
sense of presence in the real 
world with digital overlay

Fully immersive: User’s visual 
sensation is controlled by the 
system inside the virtual world

What is this trend about? (continued)
Most mature immersive-reality solutions fall under a few key themes
Not exhaustive

Immersive-reality technologies

Learning and 
assessment

Product design and 
development

Enhanced situational 
awareness

Learning and training: Hands-on skills and 
procedures training—especially useful for 
simulating unusual or dangerous edge 
cases that are difficult to simulate safely in 
real life, thus building muscle memory

Product design: Creation of digital twins to 
enable virtual walk-throughs of a physical 
environment (eg, construction site) or a 
physical product (eg, new space satellite), 
enabling more efficient product prototyping and 
test simulations

Overlay of data visualization enables 
more productive assessment of situations

Retail example: Store manager observes 
store while wearing AR glasses that display 
sales data overlaid on sections and products

B2C use cases (eg, gaming, 
fitness, retail)

Live events: Gaming, virtual workouts, and 
other virtual events mimicking real-life 
experiences such as concerts, conferences, 
sporting events, and fashion shows

Assessment: Use of the same infrastructure 
(eg, 3-D models, procedure rules) to stress-test 
the workforce’s knowledge, skill, and capability 
in safety and efficiency and target further 
training needs 

Development: Simulation of process design, 
such as a software engineer “grabbing” blocks 
of code overlaid virtually onto factory 
equipment to redesign the process flow, then 
pushing the equipment back into production

Manufacturing example: Lead engineer 
conducts factory operations and maintenance 
remotely; VR tech enables workers to conduct 
virtual walk-throughs, with visualized data and 
pop-up decision options for areas requiring 
maintenance or repair

Virtual showroom: Shopping by virtually 
walking through stores, trying on new 
products, etc

What are the most 
noteworthy technologies? 

Immersive-reality technologies

AR

VR

 Augmented reality (AR) is a partly immersive experience in 
which users interact directly with a 3-D overlay onto the 
external reality in real time

 Examples of AR technology devices include AR projections 
from phone devices, AR windshield on cars, AR glasses  

 Capabilities needed to advance this technology include 

common use higher resolution displays (eg, 8K), more precise 
eye sensing and tracking technology to reduce lags and errors 
in display overlay, etc

 Virtual reality is a fully immersive digital experience in which 
computer-graphics-rendered virtual worlds replace the 
real world

 Examples of VR technology devices include headsets for a 

fully immersive VR experience 

 Capabilities needed to accelerate this technology include 

specialized lower-latency hardware, improved sensors that 
allow for full-body virtual tracking, etc

Significant advancements are still 
required for AR/VR and are 8–10 
years out

While some capabilities are technically 
possible today in isolation, device 
makers need to consider features such 
as battery life, weight, and ergonomics, 
which adds challenges (eg, 8K displays 
exist but are too heavy and expensive for 
common use)

AR requires technology that is 
significantly superior to that of VR

Unlocking scalability will require reducing 
prices by >50%

What are the most noteworthy technologies? (continued)
A diverse set of sensors and input will be needed, expanding the peripherals market 10−20× from today 

Immersive-reality technologies

Type

On-body sensors

Off-body sensors

Overview

On-body sensors are tools to track and identify users and the objects around them to 
accurately reflect their limb movements and the physical objects around them in 
the virtual world (eg, devices that are handheld or concealed in wearables)

Off-body sensors allow for more precise recreation of elements of the physical world
in virtual spaces with consumer applications like Nintendo Wii or enterprise applications 
such as spatial-mapping hardware

Haptics

Haptic devices (eg, haptic gloves or vests) convey the sense of touch to the user with 
vibrations to augment virtual experiences

Holography and 
volumetric video

Electromyography 
(EMG)

Holograms and volumetric video diffract light across multiple wave fronts to display high-
quality, 3-D representations that can be seen without using a headset (eg, Microsoft 
Mesh or Google Project Starline)

EMG is a neuro technology that detects and records electrical activity from muscles 
to control movement and manipulate objects in virtual spaces and is being used in 
wearables to augment AR/VR headset devices

Microelectromechanical 
system (MEMS)

MEMS uses midair ultrasonic waves to allow users to physically feel tactile 
experiences without any wearables

What disruptions could the trend enable? 

Immersive-reality technologies

Maturity level

AR

VR

Near term
0–3 years

Medium term
3–10 years

AR exists mostly as a proof 
of concept with few 
enterprise use cases; 
experiences occur within 
narrowly defined 
environments (eg, 
warehouses) and overlay low-fi 
visuals over the real world

Consumer AR is introduced as a 
low-fi experience while 
enterprise AR improves, with 
augmented visuals interacting 
more fluidly with external inputs 
and usability expanding out of 
preprogrammed spaces and use 
cases

Long term/end state
10+ years

Consumer AR shrinks and use 
cases proliferate, with a 
seamless digital layer acting as an 
overlay to the real world; as users 
navigate fluidly throughout their 
day, external sensors interpret, 
interact with, and enhance the 
physical environment

Medium-fidelity VR
experiences offer limited 
virtual worlds and 
experiences; avatars are 
manipulated using external 
peripherals that limit 
immersion

High-fidelity and comfortable VR 
experiences are available at 
scale; avatars are manipulated via 
body movements captured by 
sensors

Virtual worlds in VR are almost 
indistinguishable from real life, 
and haptics have improved to give 
a realistic sense of feel across the 
body

Will immersive reality shift the new wave of (remote) work?
Many business are reconsidering their remote vs in-person work operating models as 
COVID-19 measures are relaxed. As immersive-reality tech boosts collaboration and 
facilitates remote operations, will remote work be here to stay?

Will initial ideas continue to stall at proof of concept—or 
begin to break through to scale? What will be the triggers for 
breakout success?
Significant tech advancements still required for AR/VR are approximately 8–10 years out. 
Although some of the required individual capabilities are technically possible today, device 
makers still need to produce these features (eg, battery life, weight, ergonomics) in 
conjunction with each other to improve sensory precision, mitigate security and privacy 
concerns, and broaden consumer applications, among other factors.

How will consumer-oriented pioneering platforms integrate 
with enterprise tech architectures?
Adopting immersive-reality solutions puts a strain on tech architecture. Enterprises will have 
to evolve their capabilities to integrate with these new technologies while mitigating privacy 
and security concerns; the investments required to do so are unclear.

To what extent can immersive reality facilitate the spread of 
false information?
Deepfake technology and mixed reality facilitate misrepresentation (eg, facial-swap features), 
which could have social implications such as cultural appropriation or the spread of “fake 
news” for targeted political influence or any other malicious intent.

How can virtual crimes be mitigated and regulated?
Ethical questions are emerging around the potential psychological effects of immersive-
reality technologies, raising questions around how to deal with different forms of harm, 
such as virtual violence, bullying, and trespassing.

What are some 
topics of debate 
related to the 
trend?

1 Impact of ML 

industrialization 
on organizations 
and technical 
talent

How can solutions that industrialize ML change organizations, 
their operating models, and their engineering roles?

Industrializing machine learning

The technologies are part of a wider effort in scaling ML operations toward a modular, 
automated, monitored life cycle approach to AI/ML—potential impact:



reduce resourcing needs and production times
‘democratize’ (ie, use nonspecialized) data scientists working horizontally on most
value-add tasks, assisted by standardized tooling
reduce technical barriers and enable closer collaboration with nontechnical SMEs,1
offering greater visibility and expanding potential use cases 



2 Selection criteria 
for solution 
that industrialize 
ML

How should organizations select which solutions that 
industrialize ML are most relevant to their needs and strategy? 



Industry-specific use cases influence ML workflows, varying drastically across risk 
levels, required data governance, SME relevance, and model complexity

 Potential long-term dependency on 3rd-party vendors means organizations may have long-
term partnerships rather than solution providers, often making trade-offs between best-
of-breed vs end-to-end/cloud-native ML platforms and open-source vs supported 
enterprise software

3 Accountability 
for AI and ML

As the solutions that industrialize ML grow, how can roles of 
accountability be defined to ensure trustworthy and 
responsible AI/ML?

 Processes and accountability for maintaining ML solutions are currently poorly defined,

with lack of clarity on roles of responsibility across the ML workflow

 As with applied AI, organizations will have to make trade-offs on which aspects of 

trustworthy AI are priorities for their business, which will have downstream impact on their 
decisions and interactions with solutions industrializing ML

Why are the technologies 
interesting, compared with 
what already exists?

From manual, time-intensive 
work flows and techniques …

Reliance on dedicated developers to 
participate in every step of the development 
cycle, from planning to maintenance, 
contributes to higher costs and talent gaps

Manual infrastructure configuration and 
monitoring involve high mean time to restore 
(MTTR), security risks, and task repetition, 
leading to inefficient resource utilization 

Developers working together to write code 
as ‘pair programmers’ on the same 
workstation expend a high number of person-
hours to build the program

Development cycles are slow because teams 
experience interruptions, code has more 
defects, and time is spent on manual tasks

Next-generation software development

… to automated, simplified, and 
faster development techniques

Greater participation of ‘citizen developers’ 
(business users who have insignificant 
technical experience but are able to build 
business applications without involving 
technical teams) facilitates quick development 
of solutions more aligned to business needs

Automated configuration and monitoring 
through infrastructure-as-code reduces 
downtime and increases overall productivity 
and security

AI-based pair programmers are making solo 
developers more efficient and improving quality 
of code

Fully automated CI/CD pipelines enable 
lower disruption, higher code quality, and 
drastically shorter development cycles

Microservices 
and APIs

AI-based 
testing

Modest amount of 
customization is
possible, compared 
with traditional 
programming 
languages

Monitoring and 
debugging 
applications is 
difficult, especially 
when they are 
integrated across 
several low-code/no-
code platforms

Comprehensive 
monitoring and 
version control is 
required to ensure 
errors do not spread 
across servers

Fragmented 
vendors could 
disrupt integrated 
applications, given 
uncoordinated 
changes and 
upgrades

Generated code 
may be unusable 
or inefficient and 
may have 
security 
vulnerabilities

Coders can be 
steered in the 
wrong direction if 
tools are not 
regularly updated 
with the standards 
or trained on 
clean, fast code

Customizing 
APIs is difficult 
without significant 
time and effort

APIs introduce 
security risks by 
adding another 
attack layer that 
can be exploited

Automated

Tools do not 
identify all 
defects and 
inefficiencies in 
code

Autonomous 
tools are 
typically 
specialized (eg,

To what extent can no-code tech reduce the need for 
traditional software developers?
While low-code/no-code platforms help teams rapidly prototype or enable 
citizen developers to take over some of the work developers do, they are still 
not flexible enough to reduce development work at every stage of the software 
development life cycle (eg, when legacy systems require upgrades)

From a cultural standpoint, will teams—both 
developers and non-developers—embrace or resist 
next-generation technologies? 
Automation technologies reduce time spent on development, which raises 
concerns for employees whose workflows are highly automatable; developers, 
testers, and analysts may be reluctant or eager to switch to new technologies, 
depending on job security, technical comfort, etc

What intellectual-property issues might affect code 
written by an AI application?

As companies leverage AI generation tools, there is a concern around 
ownership: Will the company that developed the application own it, or will it 
belong to the AI-enabled code generation tool provider?

4 To what extent will business units take responsibility 

for the ‘health’ of applications?

As next-generation software brings development capabilities to “citizen 
developers” embedded in business units, questions about organizational 
structure and responsibilities emerge—eg, as business users create 
applications, who is responsible for maintaining them?

What disruptions could quantum computing enable?

Quantum technologies

Quantum computing 
could unleash 
significant business 
value across 
industries, but 
achieving this will 
require extensive 
research and 
development

Applications

Most known use cases can fit into 4 archetypes:

Quantum 
simulation

Quantum linear 
algebra

Quantum 
optimization

Quantum 
factorization

Simulation of quantum-mechanical systems such as molecules, chemical 
reactions, or electrons to enable use cases such as lead identification in 
drug discovery or simulation of proteins in pharmaceuticals and 
agriculture

Algorithms that can provide an exponential speedup over conventional 
algorithms and be used in tasks such as providing financial advice, 
autonomous driving, automated trading, and predictive maintenance

Real-time optimization by compressing computation times from hours to 
seconds, enabling use cases such as generative design, traffic 
management, and portfolio optimization in almost every industry; current 
quantum-optimization approaches yield only a quadratic speedup, which 
when accounting for the overhead of using quantum versus traditional 
computing does not yet yield a significant performance improvement

The earliest identified application of quantum computing, efficient quantum 
factorization is readily applicable to breaking RSA encryption, the basis of 
most of today’s secure data-transfer protocols; achieving this will require 
managing many more high-quality qubits than have currently been done

Before ‘impossible tasks’ become solvable, we expect 
incremental value creation through hybrid solutions with 
conventional supercomputers:

Meanwhile, researchers work on improving quantum 
computers with 2 major goals:

• Solving business-relevant optimization problems in certain niches 

• Improved processors: Create stand-alone, fully capable 

would be 10% faster than previously possible 

• Simulating the properties of small molecules with 5% higher 
accuracy can enable the creation of new products, such as 
simulating surfactants to develop a better carpet cleaner

• Better data sampling to train AI may take longer, but the trained 

algorithm gives 20% better answers

to achieve “quantum advantage” over classical computers 

• Market-ready tech stack: Overcome engineering challenges

Quantum technologies

Advantages

Uncertainties and risks

Early-mover advantage: Organizations can begin investing in 
talent and infrastructure, establish or join quantum-technology 
ecosystems early, and prepare for upcoming disruption by 
identifying relevant use cases for their businesses while the 
technology matures through fundamental scientific research

Short-term applications: Many industries stand to gain from 
the benefits of quantum computing in the very short term, even if 
it needs to be paired with traditional high-power computation

Technical challenges: This includes the ability to manage a 
sufficient quantity and quality of qubits over enough time to 
derive meaningful computational results

Cost-effectiveness: Most calculations performed by enterprise 
quantum computers can be performed reasonably well by 
traditional supercomputers and at a much lower cost; this is 
expected to change once quantum advantage is achieved and 
general-purpose quantum computers take center stage

Uncertain road map: Current advancements in quantum 
technologies paint a promising future, but there may be potential 
barriers to adoption (eg, regulatory, technological, financial) that 
are not yet apparent

Nascent ecosystem: Only a handful of proven hardware 
platforms are commercially available, and talent skilled in 
quantum computing is exceedingly rare; this may change as the 
technology matures and adoption increases

What are some topics 
of debate related to
the trend?

1

Technology 
readiness

Quantum technologies are nascent, 
with many unanswered questions; 
despite generally optimistic outlooks, 
these technologies still face an 
uncertain future

2

Impact and 
disruption

3

Organizational 
preparedness

Quantum technologies

Will quantum tech be ready in the next 10 years?

 Many organizations have claimed that their quantum computers are outperforming 

classical supercomputers, hinting at mature products within a decade
 However, research is often disputed, and experts have refuted claims of 

quantum supremacy in the past

 Moreover, quantum computers have not yet replaced classical computers in 

any specific niche despite claims of supremacy, indicating that technologies have 
yet to mature

Will quantum tech be as disruptive as projected?

 Organizations from nearly every industry are already experimenting with or 

showing interest in quantum computing, while quantum communications is 
already being piloted by customers in many parts of the world

 Despite years of research, quantum computers are still not consistently better 

than classical computers at solving any major business problem

 Currently, the best quantum approaches to optimization yield only a quadratic 

speedup, which is not clearly superior to traditional computing when the additional 
overhead associated with quantum computing (such as error correction) is 
accounted for

 Quantum computing is not expected to affect most computational work and 

will be useful only for niche tasks

How should companies prepare for quantum tech?





Talent acquisition will be a major challenge for organizations in the near term, as 
companies rush to hire the few experts in the field
Identifying effective use cases before quantum technologies mature will give an 
upper hand to forward-thinking organizations

 Current quantum computers require massive investments to operate, yet they 
provide computational power similar to that of less costly traditional computers
 Since the quantum-technology stack has yet to mature, companies may find it 
difficult to predict which hardware paradigm for quantum computers will 
dominate in the next 10 to 15 years

Trust architectures and digital identity

What are the most noteworthy technologies?

Zero-trust architecture assumes “zero trust” for more robust and secure data flow across technical systems

From: Traditional, perimeter-based 
architecture

After users are verified and gain access past perimeter controls, 
everything within the network is assumed safe, which does 
not robustly protect against inner threats

Organization

To: Zero-trust architecture 

Benefits

The assumption is that all entities, within and outside the 
organization, are not to be trusted
 Controls (eg, identity and access management, network 
controls) are set up for any interaction by an entity 
within the network

Benefits

 Users interact directly with ID issuers and organizations without relying on an 

 Users can provide alternative identifying information, such as:

intermediary to facilitate data exchange

 Data and user credentials are stored on a decentralized ledger (eg, blockchain) for 

easy access and verification

— Biometrics (eg, facial scan, retinal scan, thumbprint, voice)

— Devices and apps (eg, mobile phone, email)

— Documents (eg, driver’s license, passport)





Increased individual control over identity for trusted transactions without an 
intermediary; users themselves control what data they share and with whom from 
an interoperable and convenient identity source

Improved security, because decentralized data storage limits vulnerability to 
attacks

 Alternative protections against rising vulnerability attacks (eg, phishing, 

brute-force password cracking)

 Reduced inefficiencies for the user (eg, too many passwords, lost password)
 Efficiency and convenience; users can rely on streamlined identifying 

information, based on the level of risk associated with the system

What are the most noteworthy technologies? (continued)

Privacy engineering governs data privacy protection, while XAI builds trust in AI models

Privacy engineering

Explainable AI

Description

 Design techniques used to enable the practice governing 
implementation, operations, and maintenance of privacy

 Broadly, these technologies support the strategic reduction of 

privacy risks, resource allocation, and implementation of privacy 
controls

 AI-related techniques combining social science and 

psychology to enable people to understand, appropriately trust, 
and effectively manage emerging AI technologies

 Types of “explainability” differ based on the explanation objective 
(eg, explaining how the model works, clarifying why a model input 
led to its output, and providing additional information needed for 
people to trust a model and deploy it)

Benefits



Increased safety and control over data for customers, 
employees, and organizations, resulting from additional controls 
and protective measures

 Easier process to implement privacy changes, because the 

technologies form a privacy infrastructure that can facilitate privacy 
updates from the continually evolving regulatory landscape

 More fair algorithmic outputs given that XAI technologies can 

help mitigate bias in the data, model, and other processes





Increased transparency, confidence, and reliability in AI 
models, improving organizational performance, reputation, 
and relationships

Improved efficiency and effectiveness across AI model 
pipeline, due to greater understanding of model data, inputs, 
outputs, and algorithms

What should leaders consider when 
engaging with the trend? 

Trust architectures and digital identity

Zero-trust architecture 

Digital identity

Long-term effort with incremental progress

Nascent ecosystem

Effective and full-fledged ZTA, privacy engineering, 
and XAI cannot be implemented immediately; for 
reliable results, organizations should gradually 
increase their controls and test them 

Performance efficiency and scalability 

Added authentication steps (eg, secure 
communications using VPN and public key 
infrastructure [PKI]) can slow daily work and network 
efficiency; this can vary based on the frequency of 
controls and size of the network

SSI has relatively few standards available, and Web3 is a 
rapidly growing space

Various dependencies

Progress depends on use of existing standards and 
infrastructures (eg, data regulations) and on development of 
rising technologies; registering alternative verified credentials 
can also be a complex process

Concerns over privacy of biometric data

Control, storage, and use of biometric data is a debated topic 
regarding privacy and ethics

Privacy engineering
Inherent tension between privacy and fairness

Explainable AI
Lack of standardization

Privacy and fairness can conflict: privacy approaches 
could restrict collection of personal data, while 
fairness approaches would collect personal data to 
detect bias  

Deciphering the “black box” of large AI models to provide a 
meaningful explanation is challenging and depends on the 
task; resulting solutions could face new or unaddressed 
risks and need to balance privacy, fairness, accountability, 
responsibility, transparency, and ethics

Overarching risks and uncertainties

Implementation complexity will be significant given 
resource requirements, talent scarcity, lack of shared 
taxonomies, coordination challenges across multiple 
parties, and required shifts in organizational norms and 
practices needed to achieve effective deployments
Compatibility challenges will be encountered when 
updating or migrating technologies and integrating them 
with legacy systems or with an abundance of fragmented 
point solutions
Evolving regulations involving digital trust and privacy 
have become a prominent topic, as past standards (eg, on 
data privacy and data permanency) conflict with these 
technologies; regulatory measures to reconcile these 
differences and define newer areas will influence the direction 
of digital trust

Tensions between privacy and fairness can arise, for 
example, tension between the avoidance of excessive 
collection of demographic data and the need for that data to 
assess and mitigate bias

Lack of standardization and widely accepted best practices 
for how or when to use trust architecture techniques across 
industries will continue to be a challenge

digital identity? 

Trust architectures and digital identity

Zero-trust 
architecture

A Latin American oil and gas company with a small IT estate began maturing its 
capabilities before establishing a ZTA rollout plan; rollout of the security update 
occurred on a system-by-system basis, targeting high-risk assets first, with the 
first full ZTA proof of concept implemented 1 year following rollout start date

Self-

identity

BankID is a digital-identification service providing users in Sweden a single 
source of ID through their mobile phones; with BankID, users can make payments, 
participate in financial services, log in to government platforms, and access their 
medical records.

Passwordless 
identity

Apple has been working toward passwordless sign-ins, such as with Touch ID (ie, 
thumbprint) and Face ID (ie, facial recognition); As of May 2022, numerous 
technology companies and service providers, including Google and Microsoft, are 
working with the FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium to support 
passwordless sign-in standards

What are some 
topics of debate 
related to the 
trend?

Development of digital trust 
depends on other trending 
technologies and the overall 
ecosystem, raising questions 
about its path forward.

1 Stakeholder 
expectations

2

Data and 
privacy 
regulation

Trust architectures and digital identity

How are the expectations of customers, employees, and 
communities changing in terms of data (especially 
privacy), transparency and outcomes of analytics, and 
technology security and resilience?

As new technologies seek to personalize the user experience, stakeholders 
will expect a balance between privacy (a priority that calls for not collecting 
demographic data) and fairness (a priority that can use demographic data to 
test for and correct biases). In one study, 97% of people surveyed expressed 
concern that businesses and the government might misuse their data.1

How do regulators reconcile past standards with rising 
technologies that have inherent conflicts?

Existing data privacy regulations can be at odds with emerging Web3 
technologies. For example, the “right to be forgotten” from the General Data 
Protection Regulation in the EU enforces people’s right to have their data 
deleted. Storing data on the blockchain, however, creates the potential for an 
immutable ledger from which past data cannot be “deleted.”

3 Risk area 

identification

Where are companies typically most exposed to digital 
and analytics risk?

Improperly-decommissioned legacy systems, breaches to 3rd-party partners, 
and poorly configured database links, for example, are vulnerabilities that 
hackers can exploit. The right risk-management approach will require 
companies to define a mature enterprise-risk framework and conduct formal, 
holistic risk assessments tailored to their individual systems.

Web3

August 2022

What is the tech trend about? 

Web3 includes platforms and applications that enable shifts toward a 
future, decentralized internet with open standards and protocols while 
protecting digital ownership rights, providing users greater data ownership 
and control over how their data is monetized, and catalyzing new business 
models

Web3

Web2 (Current)
“Internet users (mostly) exchange their data 
for services based on TOS1” 

Web3
“Internet users own their data and shape 
the terms of its use”

Highlights

Centralization where large platforms govern access and 
own the user data. Users have the “right to be forgotten” 
in some jurisdictions

Disintermediation with a shift toward individual ownership and control 
over data monetization, functionality, and value 

Business 
model

Data monetization by tech platforms (eg, personalized 
ads, revenue sharing) where user audiences are often 
the “product” sold to advertisers

Revenues are shared back to users and/or capital contributors
through smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations 
(DAOs)

Technical 
infrastructure

Centralized and aggregated services (eg, cloud computing 
services, security models, app stores)

Private code, private data, cloud platform-based security 
models

Accessible tools for building on the platform  and services

1Terms of service.

Decentralized databases and software programs (eg, smart contracts)

Open-source code, public immutable data, public-private key cryptography, 
and composability (ie, ability to fork and integrate on top of existing projects)

Accessible tools for building on the services but often in new languages 
and with Web3-specific components

Why should leaders pay attention?

Web3 is based on a more decentralized, community-governed set of protocols that could represent a paradigm shift of 
authority and ownership to individuals with potentially far-reaching implications

Web3

Disruption of existing 
business models

Rapid innovation 
through open protocols

Increased access 
and inclusion

Opportunity to build 
new infrastructure

Unified customer 
experience

Web3 enables the 
disintermediation of 
business models by 
encoding existing 
functionality into 
autonomous smart 
contracts. Web3 could 
offer wider economic 
opportunities  (eg, 
decreased fees), moving 
the accumulation of value 
away from middlemen and 
toward users and suppliers

Source: Expert input; McKinsey analysis

Rapid innovation is 
unlocked by the open-
source and modular 
nature of Web3, which 
allows for rapid 
development, testing, 
and scaling of 
applications, built by a 
global developer base. 
This composability and 
growing developer base 
could increase the level of 
innovation exponentially 
over time

Web3 is public and 
permissionless, meaning 
that everyone can 
access, create, and own 
information and assets, 
globally, without 
intermediaries

Web3 infrastructure is 
nascent; new 
applications require new 
tools and infrastructure 
to scale and meet 
expected service 
requirements (eg, 
development platforms 
needed to build Web3 
internet services, 
middleware software, node 
infrastructure, etc)

Web3 enables a transition 
from omnichannel to 
unichannel, seamlessly 
integrating customers’ 
digital identity across 
applications by leveraging 
a common decentralized 
blockchain data layer, as 
opposed to a siloed view of 
customers that is limited to 
an individual business’s 
customer profile

Web3

What industries are beginning to adopt and shape Web3? 
Many use cases across industries are being identified and built, especially as the tech infrastructure improves

Media and entertainment: 
Gaming

Web3 enables interoperability across 
games, digital assets facilitating new 
gaming experiences, and play-and-earn 
business models in which in-game rewards 
(eg, NFTs) are distributed with different 
utilities and value

Media and entertainment: 
Digital art and media
Creation and ownership of digital media 
(eg, artworks, video content)—sold as 
NFTs—allow new business models and 
creative possibilities while providing artists 
with more control and, in some cases, 
ongoing perpetual royalties

Retail

Financial services

Retailers are using Web3 
technologies to create 
new offerings, devise new 
modes of customer 
engagement (eg, 
ecosystem loyalty 
programs, access to 
unique experiences), 
assure the authenticity of 
goods, tap into new 
royalty-based revenue 
streams, accept novel 
payment methods (such 
as “stablecoins”), and 
track and orchestrate 
logistics across loosely 
coupled global supply 
chains

DeFi is an ecosystem of 
applications that could 
autonomously perform similar 
services to traditional financial 
institutions, albeit with very 
different levels of protection, 
and where the traditional 
revenues are handed back to 
users or liquidity providers of 
these applications. Many are 
governed through token-based 
distributed governance 
systems. Other areas of 
financial services exploring 
Web3 applications include 
payments, asset management, 
and some areas of capital 
markets

today to play-and-earn3

Web3

Media and entertainment: Gaming

Innovations

Potential risks and uncertainties

Incentives for players in a play-and-earn model where players earn in-
game digital assets (eg, NFTs, in-game tokens) while playing, and can 
easily monetize these rewards via peer-to-peer networks or exchanges

Distributed ownership opportunities, where players can realize true 
ownership of in-game assets, with long-term potential for interoperability 
across different Web3-enabled games and metaverse

Community-based development where the player community can share 
feedback with developers and vote to change some in-game dynamics or 
codevelop game patches and updates

Different business model for gaming companies through digital-asset 
sales, secondary-market royalties (eg, for NFTs), and value exchange 
channels (eg, dedicated marketplaces)

Source: Expert input; McKinsey analysis

High barriers of entry due to up-front investment (eg, in-game NFT 
and/or token purchases) and knowledge of existing Web3 tools (eg, 
self-custodial wallets) to start playing games

Low-fidelity gaming experience of present NFT games relative to 
traditional Web2 gaming, largely attributable to nascency of industry

Incentive-driven player base, such that player retention is at risk if 
rate of earnings decline, absent other incentives (eg, compelling 
gameplay) 

Controversy in the traditional gaming community, where lack of 
understanding of Web3’s value proposition and skepticism toward 
increasing monetization models is driving backlash

Nascency of infrastructure, in particular related to transaction 
costs, throughput, and security, to access and play the game reliably

Regulatory uncertainty on asset classification of in-game NFTs and 
digital assets, and of play-and-earn new business models

Risks and uncertainties

Greater cost efficiency through employing smart contracts whose 
programmable logic determines automated decisioning and disbursement 
(eg, in decentralized lending, swaps)

Interest revenues and trading fees returned to users (eg, depositors, 
liquidity providers, lenders) instead of flowing back to the central enterprise

Broader investor base and enhanced liquidity for traditionally illiquid or 
inaccessible investment assets (eg, fractionalized commercial real estate)

Greater transparency of transactions since all ownership and 
transaction data reside on, and are potentially discoverable on, the 
blockchain

Low credit risk and delinquency in applications such as DeFi lending 
that entail overcollateralization requirements and automatic liquidations

Facility for providing always-on financial services (24/7), such as

Limited or absent consumer protections (eg, for funds held in custody), 
including irreversibility of any fraudulent transactions

Immature user experience, often with poor interface design and lacking 
seamless integration with traditional financial services (eg, onboarding, 
funds transfer)

Security concerns, including the compromise and collapse of some 
nascent projects in DeFi, wallet theft, and poor AML/KYC1 controls

Nascent technology, lacking traditional data privacy when using open, 
permissionless distributed ledgers and reliant on software (smart contracts) 
and data (oracles) that are not yet battle-tested at scale

What are some broader uncertainties affecting Web3 adoption?

Web3

Nonexhaustive

Evolving regulation as authorities choose 
approaches to governing issues such as consumer 
and investor protection, asset classification (eg, 
security, commodity, currency) and its implications, 
legality, and enforceability of blockchain-based 
contracts, accounting and tax standards, capital 
provisioning, accountability mechanisms, and know-
your-customer and antimoney-laundering standards

User experience and value proposition of Web3 
alternatives compared with incumbent systems 
(which also are continuing to evolve) are often either 
poor, unclear, or poorly understood

Ecosystem infrastructure is nascent and will 
continue to mature as business models (eg, 
merchants accepting digital loyalty tokens) and value 
chains (eg, creation, trading, and secure storage of 
NFTs) are tested and refined or discarded

Consumer protection is increasingly becoming a 
focal point for regulators, especially during times of 
failure of several nascent Web3 projects (eg, the 
FTC’s Consumer Protection Data Spotlight of June 
2022 found that consumers lost $575 million from 
January 2021 to March 2022 as a result of bogus 
cryptocurrency investment opportunities)

Robustness of new technologies that depend on 
code (eg, smart contracts) or data (eg, oracles) is 
improving but has experienced some notable 
failures. The composability of underlying Web3 code 
can perpetuate vulnerabilities

Sustainability differences among Web3 
platforms—relative to conventional alternatives—are 
shifting, given the high-energy consumption of older 
proof-of-work-based systems and the enhanced 
efficiency of alternatives such as proof-of-stake-
based systems

What are some 
controversial 
topics regarding 
Web3?

Nonexhaustive

Web3

1 Reliability and 

sustainability

Which Web3 business models and value chains will emerge as 
technically reliable, scalable, and commercially sustainable?

Business models must show they can produce more value for users than existing systems, 
achieve uptake beyond an enthusiastic cohort of early adopters, and overcome volatile periods. 
They must also satisfy evolving regulations for consumer protection, asset classification, and 
know-your-customer standards

2

Patterns of 
adoption

Given Web3’s nascency and rapid development, what will unlock 
mainstream adoption? As a cultural phenomenon, how will patterns of 
Web3 adoption vary among different populations?

In order to become mainstream, Web3 tech needs to improve in terms of scalability, reliability, and 
security, with accessible developer tooling and improved user experience for consumers. Adoption 
across geographies will differ depending on a variety of factors, including government regulations, 
public interest in an open internet, and access to adequate connectivity

3 Enterprise 

architecture 
integration

How will Web3 ecosystems coexist and interconnect with enterprise 
system architectures and with hyperscale Web2 platforms? 

Interoperability of platforms will be necessary for users to transfer assets (eg, enabling the transfer 
of avatars between different virtual worlds). This interoperability is a stark departure from the 
centralized business models of many web 2.0 businesses

4 Regulating trust How will regulatory action influence trust in Web3 and affect 

potential future innovation?
Insufficient clarity around regulatory frameworks on Web3 technologies may contribute to reduced 
trust among users and developers. At the same time, Web3 may address a growing need for 
empowerment of the individual across data, functionality, and value, enhancing the trust of users 
and developers in the Web3 fundamentals

5 New models 

and the 
metaverse

Source: McKinsey analysis

How will the Web3 and immersive-reality trends influence existing 
models for accessing and building systems on the internet and come 
together to enable new experiences in the metaverse?
As the Web3 trend blends with others, new propositions and platforms will emerge. The 
metaverse, for example, could leverage tech trends like immersive reality and advanced 
connectivity to enhance and enable innovative user experiences in Web3 environments. 
Future use cases of open learning, working, entertaining could take place here

Benefits

Risks and 
uncertainties

Expected outcomes

Sustainable, accessible food source

Production techniques are more accessible, environmentally friendly, 
friendly to animal welfare, and friendly to worker welfare

Consumer acceptance and unknown long-term health 
impact

Consumer perception is crucial for adoption of cultivated meat; 
producers need to strengthen confidence in safety and nutritional 
value, which varies depending on meat type; novel processes may 
use ingredients with unknown long-term health effects

Economic disruption and scale

Cultivated-meat adoption could disrupt existing agricultural value 
chains if society decides to adopt alternative foods broadly

High prices and limited variety

As a relatively nascent product, cultivated 
meat is priced higher than traditional meat

What are some topics 
of debate related to
the trend?

With its cross-disciplinary innovations 
and potential cross-cutting impact, 
bioengineering ventures into 
interconnected areas of debate

1

Risk and 
bioethics

How should we use bioethics to determine the 
appropriate extent for genome editing? 

Future of bioengineering

 Biology is self-replicating and self-sustaining; it lacks boundaries; due to 
gaps in knowledge and interconnections among the biological sciences, 
experimentation could lead to unintended, potentially harmful consequences 

 Some gene therapies and other methods (somatic gene editing) are generally 



viewed as appropriate for treating rare diseases; other gene methods that could 
affect future generations (germ line gene editing) are contentious
Likewise, different values and principles can influence different perspectives on 
ethical use and misuse in bioengineering, such as editing human traits, dubbed 
“playing God”

2

Changes to 
existing daily life

How does cultivated meat fit within existing diets? Is it 
vegetarian, vegan, kosher, etc?

3

Outlook

• Cultivated meat can benefit welfare for animals and human workers (eg, it's cruelty 

free), which makes it a more ethical as well as sustainable option

• However, cultivated meat is an unprecedented and nuanced area for dietary 

restrictions (eg, some consider it to still be an animal), and individual consumers 
make take a different stance; in the future, cultivated meat could receive 
standardized certifications (eg, cruelty-free, kosher) to facilitate consumer decisions

What will shape the long-term impact and implications 
of bioengineering technologies?

 Varying perspectives debate timeline, type and scale of impact, and level of 

disruption (eg, regulatory changes) in society and the economy

 Based on their execution, these technologies could reinforce or widen 

socioeconomic disparities due to unequal levels of technological access

 Alongside the digital debate on privacy and consent, these topics also touch on 
debates related to individual personal biological information (eg, ancestry, 
hereditary traits)

What is this trend about?

The clean-energy future is a trend toward energy solutions that help achieve net-zero emissions across the energy 
value chain, from power generation or production to storage to distribution

Future of clean energy

Power generation

Renewable energy
Solar photovoltaics (PV) and thermo-solar, wind, 
geothermal, nuclear

About 84% of global power demand, which is 
estimated to grow 3× by 2050, can be met using 
renewable energy

Solar photovoltaics are expected to cover ~60%, 
onshore wind power generation to cover ~20%, 
and offshore wind power generation to cover ~4%

Sustainable fuels
Including biofuels

Hydrogen (H2)-based fuels
Production of hydrogen as an energy source

Sustainable fuels could 
decarbonize high-energy-
density requirements of 
aviation, maritime shipping, 
and heavy freight 

Demand growth rate is 
expected to outpace that 
of fossil fuels

Limited capital is required 
to transition; these “drop-
in” fuels do not require 
upgrading existing engines

Producing decarbonized 
hydrogen (blue, using carbon 
capture; green, using 
renewable electricity) is 
projected to cost less than 
producing conventional 
hydrogen (gray, from natural 
gas) by 2030

Electrolyzers’ critical role in

primarily manipulating 
semiconducting 
materials (organics1 and 
perovskites2) at nano-
scale to achieve higher 
efficiencies

On- and offshore wind generation

Nuclear fusion

Wind power plants with larger rotors, blades, and 
height are better suited to harvest lower wind 
speeds at higher altitudes

Offshore plants (expected by 2025) face 
engineering challenges (eg, marine 
infra-structure); onshore turbines face 
nontechnical limits3

Wind turbines mounted on floating structures
allow power generation in water depths where 
bottom-mounted structures are not feasible

Current global shift from single-turbine pilots to 
multiturbine projects is expected by 2025 or later

Fusion is the process of 
combining atoms under high 
temperatures and pressure to 
release clean energy

Market 
penetration and 
timing of 
autonomy

Future of smart 
mobility in 
cities 

Impact of 
shared mobility

Timing for new 
aerial modes of 
transport 

Sustainable and 
inclusive air 
mobility

What share of vehicle sales will autonomous vehicles account for?
While autonomy offers significant benefits (eg, reduction in traffic deaths, improvements in fuel economy), widespread adoption may be hindered by 
safety concerns (eg, several high-profile accidents), data protection issues, high upfront costs (vehicles and infrastructure), and insufficient regulation

Ground transportation

Air mobility

How will future-of-mobility trends shape cities?

Smart mobility reduces traffic congestion and air and noise pollution, and it improves safety, speed, and cost of travel; however, urban infrastructure 
plans are often criticized for imposing heavy investment requirements and creating security/privacy concerns

Will advancements in shared mobility deliver on hoped-for financial and environmental impact?

Shared mobility has not yet proved its long-term economic viability, as many operators struggle with profitability; further, shared mobility must prove its 
sustainability impact as a full replacement for private cars, with an associated shift away from private-vehicle ownership (rather than its primary role 
today as an extension of private vehicles, thereby increasing the vehicle fleet)

What scale will advanced air mobility achieve in the next decade? 

While air mobility enthusiasts project that over the coming decade (or soon after), an electric aircraft could become a popular mode of transportation 
and a viable alternative to traditional taxis, few players have so far managed to bridge the engineering-to-scale chasm, overcome product and business 
model uncertainties, or bend customer perception challenges related to noise and visual aesthetics 

When should customers expect affordable advanced air mobility solutions?

Novel, subscale modes of aerial transportation with a premium price tag may become available to customers in the next decade, but the industry may 
take significantly longer to scale and bend the cost of a short-haul flight to the equivalent of a taxi ride

What are the most 
noteworthy technologies?

Nonexhaustive

Future of space technologies

Technological advancements and the reduction of size, weight, and power of satellites and launch vehicles have contributed to cost-
effectiveness, making new space applications more economically feasible

Satellites

Application of new technologies
Higher computing power leveraging consumer 
processor tech across distributed satellite 
networks to support data collection from 
increasingly high-resolution sensors

Less expensive, higher-resolution sensors that
conduct observation of their targets (eg, Earth, 
planets), typically using passive observation in 
several spectrums (eg, optical, infrared) and active 
sensors (via radar)

Less costly, more efficient power systems using
smaller, lightweight solar panels and more efficient 
batteries, allowing small (cube) satellites to have 
greater power availability for expanded missions

Greater capabilities in a smaller size, 
weight, and power (SWaP) package, enabling 
new missions

Industrialization of assembly
Design for modularity: Manufacturing 
approach that enables faster design, 
development, and assembly via cube-sat 
architectures (built using standard dimensions, 
ie, units of 10 × 10 × 10 cm) used as 
extendable building blocks

Shift from job shop to assembly line: In 
response to increased demand (for proliferated 
constellations) and investment in facilities, 
changes in satellite production from one-off, 
hand-built examples to a more industrial 
process

Democratization of production: Lower costs 
due to new manufacturing processes, 
including additive manufacturing and modular 
designs, enabling market entry of new players 

Enabled a shift 
in architecture 
from individual 
GEO satellites 
to proliferated 
architectures in 
LEO

Architectural shift

LEO constellations
Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites,
which orbit close to Earth’s 
atmosphere (altitude 300–2,000 km)

Proliferation in number of
active satellites, from ~4,100 in 
2021 to ~2,700 in 2020, with a focus 
on mega-constellations using smaller 
satellites

Pros: Increasingly dense coverage 
and capacity globally, lower latency, 
higher flexibility and revisit

Other emerging technologies will build on the sector’s transformation over the previous decade

Communications

Digital capabilities

Deep-space 
exploration

Operations

Laser communications

Edge computing and AI

Nuclear propulsion

In-orbit servicing

Future of space technologies

Laser links would allow 
satellites to communicate 
using pulses of light for data

Potential exists to increase 
data transfer speeds by 
100x–1,000x vs traditional radio 
frequency

Ability to direct laser emitted 
to very specific locations 
(both to satellites in space and 
ground stations on Earth), 
which mitigates coverage 
overlap and interference

With the growing launch of 
satellites and spacecraft for 
activities such as Earth 
observation, higher volumes 
of data will be collected, 
introducing a need for edge 
computing

Edge computing allows for 
processing data closer to the 
point of collection in the 
cloud, leveraging AI and 
machine learning 
capabilities, reducing latency, 
and saving bandwidth to deliver 
near-real-time insights

Nuclear thermal/electric 
propulsion could propel 
spacecraft at higher speeds 
for longer distances, enabling 
deep-space exploration1

Technological advancements 
are optimizing performance and 
reliability while improving 
affordability to enable a 
cadence of more frequent 
launches

Currently in R&D; may carry 
safety risks, and most missions 
don’t have a need for rapid 
transit that would justify it 

Satellite refueling/mods: Satellites refuel or modify 
satellites in orbit to extend mission lifetime and 
capabilities and to reduce replacement costs

Orbit Fab developed end-to-end refueling using its 
Rapidly Attachable Fluid Transfer Interface (RAFTI), a 
fueling port that can also be used as a drop-in 
replacement for existing satellite fill-and-drain valves

Orbit repositioning involves raising the orbit or 
changing the inclination of a satellite

Launch: Reuse of booster structures, engines, or 
otherwise, coupled with technology advancements (eg, 
material sciences, computer-aided design, 3-D printing) 
and increases in launch rate, are contributing to a 
reduction in operational costs and an increase in 
accessibility to space

End-of-life disposal is pulling space debris to reenter 
Earth’s atmosphere for disposal, reducing collision risks

What are unresolved risks related to space technologies?

Future of space technologies

Cost-effectiveness

Governance

Cyberrisks

Space technologies must be cost-effective
for space services and human spaceflight to be 
scalable

Trade-offs exist between more cost-effective 
(higher-risk) commercial technologies and 
higher-performance, more reliable “space 
qualified” technology

Careful risk assessment is required on the 
importance of mission assurance/ 
accomplishment (eg, extensive use of 
commercial tech in constellations increases the 
risk of satellites dying prematurely and adding 
to the space debris challenge)

Governance should encompass usage 
rights and space activities

Risk and complexity of cyberthreats are 
growing

Uncontrolled proliferation of all possible 
space concepts increases the risk of 
spectrum interference, physical 
collisions, etc

Governance mechanisms need to better 
define allocation of spectrum and orbit 
usage rights in order to accommodate 
the increasing number of players, 
satellites, and applications

As dependency on space tech 
increases across different use cases, 
the potential damage resulting from 
exploitation of a cyber
vulnerability also increases

Proliferation of commercial players 
raises a question of whether all services 
will be well protected from cyberrisks

Space 
militarization

How can leaders define rights and norms?
Governments recognize space as a war-fighting domain 
(eg, GPS jamming, antisatellite weapons), as demonstrated 
by recent organizational changes (eg, space commands 
established in France, Japan, UK, US)

2

Legal 
conflicts 
between 
states

How can leaders define ownership and access 
rights?
A key need for the sector is to reach a common 
understanding about access rights and usage of 
properties and resources (eg, for Lagrange points, 
spectrum, and minerals found in space); such rights can help 
create a democratized setup whereby all can participate in the 
benefits of space

3

Space debris 
and traffic

Should LEO have limits?
As more companies access space, concern arises 
regarding space debris, space traffic management, and

Chemicals

Oil and gas

Growing markets for recycled plastics and specialty plastics created from captured CO2; conversion of CO2 into 
polyurethane foam, displacing hydrocarbon that would otherwise come from fossil fuels 

Increasing adoption of carbon sequestration to support enhanced oil recovery (EOR); CO2 EOR technology injects CO2 into 
partially depleted oil fields to force out additional volumes of oil, with CO2 being residually trapped and permanently stored

Metals and mining

Decarbonization of operations and offset of production activity effects on natural capital, as well as increasing production of 
the minerals needed for clean energy and other sustainable tech

Electric power, natural 
gas, and utilities

Consumer 
packaged goods

Variable demand for electric power based on sustainable consumption trends such as electrification 

Circular economy solutions and business models enabled by product optimization (eg, material selection, product/packaging 
design); improved product and material flows (eg, optimized reverse logistics); and enhancements in recycling (eg, new 
material recovery technologies); as well as rising demand for products with legitimate sustainability attributes

Several start-ups, such as Running Tide and Kelp Blue, have introduced technologies that grow significant 
amounts of seaweed, seagrasses, and algae through artificial farming and pregrown seeds, using CO2 to accelerate 
their growth; the plants are then used to absorb CO2 or converted into food sources for fish and marine animals

engaging with this trend? 

Future of sustainable consumption

Benefits

Risks and uncertainties

Operating savings in the long run: Cost-effective investments 
for rapidly scaling end-use-focused clean technologies (eg, 
green construction) 

Early-mover advantage: Network benefits for companies that 
join climate tech ecosystems early

Incentives: Support or guarantees for new technology takeoff 
and increase in adoption (eg, green bonds, loan guarantees, 
decarbonization subsidies)

Transparent industry standards: Mature clean-energy 
standards in developed countries and global decarbonization 
commitments

Vibrant carbon markets: Rapidly growing global markets for 
CO2 permits traded among clean-energy-ecosystem players 

Commercialization pathways for climate tech mean they aren’t 
yet cost competitive with conventional tech

Availability of critical input materials might be insufficient

Upfront and ongoing costs to decarbonize production facilities 
and value chains are of concern (eg,  green-steel production 
>40% more expensive than conventional)

Regulatory action and alignment of standards across borders 
and regions will be important

Changes in consumer behavior, compared with stated 
commitments, can affect sustainable consumption initiatives (eg, 
willingness to pay “green premiums”)

Sustainability enablers for hard-to-abate industries

How will companies and governments mobilize capital flows in support of sustainable consumption? 

Estimated capital spending of ~$9.2 trillion per year (an annual increase of as much as $3.5 trillion from 2022) is required for a global 
transition to a net-zero economy; ~85% of technologies needed to meet this target already exist, highlighting the importance of closing the 
capital funding gap to deploy these technologies across sectors and geographies

How will consumer mindsets and behaviors change? Where and how will they diverge or converge? What new 
behaviors and habits will become mainstream?
More than one-third of global consumers are ready to pay a green premium as demand grows for environmentally friendly alternatives; 
however, attitudes vary across generations, countries, and industries; relative importance of sustainability during the purchasing process will 
continue to increase

Is global adoption of sustainable agriculture practices feasible?

Sustainable agriculture benefits the environment through helping maintain soil quality, reducing erosion, and preserving water; however, 
such practices are often hard to abide by for mass agriculture farmers, given implications for crop yields, particularly challenging in regions 
with food security concerns 

To what extent will circular-economy practices (those favoring the comprehensive recovery and reuse of materials with 
minimal losses of quality) replace conventional practices?
Current momentum in circular technologies is generating a seismic shift across manufacturing industries globally; however, an attempt to 
reach a 100% recyclability rate might prove counterproductive if the price of recovery remains higher than the value of the materials 
recovered; furthermore, the existing regulatory landscape does not incentivize all ecosystem players to pursue a circular economy

5 Balance of 
decarbonization 
levers

Source: McKinsey analysis

What is an appropriate balance between carbon removal and other decarbonization levers?
CCUS is necessary in industries without other decarbonization alternatives and is already cost effective for some industrial processes; 
however, investments in carbon removals may divert funds and attention away from the critical business of reducing emissions, further 
propping up the fossil fuel industry
