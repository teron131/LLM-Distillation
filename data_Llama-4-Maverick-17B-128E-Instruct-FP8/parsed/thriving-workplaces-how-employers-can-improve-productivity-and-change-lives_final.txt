Workforce health and well-being are pivotal to 
economic vitality and societal prosperity. As burn-
out rates rise, chronic diseases become more 
common and people work longer, there is an 
urgent need for organizations, policy-makers and 
stakeholders to prioritize employee health. 

The economic imperative is clear: investing in 
employee well-being can substantially improve 
returns, enhance productivity, reduce healthcare 
costs and foster a resilient and engaged workforce. 
Analysis by the McKinsey Health Institute finds 
such investment could yield up to $11.7 trillion 
in global economic value. Such transformation, 
however, cannot be made by organizations working 
in isolation; it requires collaborative effort across the 
public and private sectors. 

This report highlights the benefits triggered by 
investing in employee health. It reveals the current 
state of workforce health and well-being, suggests 

a practical approach for creating healthier work 
environments and identifies cases in which 
organizations have made a measurable impact. 
It also advocates for a strategic, data-driven 
approach to employee health that can measure 
impact and guide interventions. By embedding 
health into organizational culture and aligning it 
with broader business goals, leaders can ensure 
that good health benefits employees, their families, 
communities and the economy. 

The path forward is clear: looking after the 
health of employees positively impacts the 
performance of organizations, the future of work 
and the development of economies and societies. 
Everyone has a role to play in creating and 
demanding a healthier workplace, but radical health 
transformation at an individual or organizational level 
cannot happen overnight. As basketball coach John 
Wooden once said, “Do not let what you cannot do 
interfere with what you can do.”

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesExecutive summary 
Investing in holistic employee health can create 
almost $12 trillion in global economic value.

As the world grapples with rapid technological 
advancements, demographic shifts and  
evolving work paradigms, it is vital to invest in 
employee health.

their counterparts in the survey. This underscores 
the need for tailored interventions to address and 
prevent health challenges and tackle the workplace 
factors that contribute to them.

Why prioritize workforce health? Investing in 
employee health can substantially increase 
economic returns. Research indicates that 
enhanced employee health and well-being could 
generate up to $11.7 trillion in global economic 
value. Organizations that prioritize health often 
see marked improvements in productivity, 
reduced absenteeism, lower healthcare costs and 
heightened employee engagement and retention. 
They are better placed to adapt to increased 
regulatory pressures on workplace health and 
safety standards and withstand greater focus from 
investors and the public on how organizations are 
meeting environmental, social and governance 
criteria. Moreover, a healthier workforce is a more 
resilient and adaptive workforce, more capable of 
navigating the uncertainties and challenges of a 
rapidly changing world. 

What is the current state of workforce health? 
Work can and should enhance health, yet it is not 
doing so for a sizeable proportion of employees. 
In a McKinsey Health Institute survey of more 
than 30,000 employees worldwide, only 57% 
reported good holistic health (an integrated view 
of an individual’s mental, physical, spiritual and 
social functioning),1 with important differences 
in holistic health and burn-out symptoms found 
across different industries and demographics. For 
example, employees who are women, LGBTQI+, 
younger or neurodivergent, or who report lower 
education levels or poor financial status, tended 
to report poorer employee health outcomes than 

How can organizations address workforce health? 
Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach, given 
that each organization is different and employees 
have varying needs, there are six “evergreen”, 
evidence-based principles for employers seeking 
to make a positive impact: understand the baseline 
health status of employees and the value at 
stake, develop initiatives for a sustainable healthy 
workforce, pilot interventions to test and learn, track 
three to five metrics to measure success, ensure 
leadership commitment and sponsorship, and 
embed employee health into organizational culture.  

These actions seem simple but are often hard 
to put into practice. Many organizations do not 
currently see or cannot measure the benefits of their 
current investments in employee health. They also 
don’t allocate resources in the most effective way – 
often, the issue is not how much is being invested 
but the type of investment being made. Rather 
than solely addressing the poor health of individual 
employees, developing a healthy workforce 
means taking a portfolio approach – addressing 
ill health and promoting good health; supporting 
individuals; and creating healthier teams, jobs and 
organizational environments.

By making work a place that improves health, 
organizations can build a strong, productive and 
engaged workforce and release greater individual 
and organizational potential. The choice to demand 
a healthy workplace is one every employee and 
investor can make.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesIntroduction
There is an urgent need to improve employee 
health. Stakeholders who take immediate action 
will reap substantial benefits.

Health is “more than the absence of disease or 
infirmity”, as the World Health Organization (WHO) 
puts it. Modern concepts of health include mental, 
physical, spiritual and social function.2 Today, more 
than 3.5 billion working adults each spend roughly 
90,000 hours (or about 45 years)3 of their lives at 
work.4 This underscores the workplace’s potential 
to profoundly influence health – not just for the 
benefit of employees but also for their families and 
the communities in which they live. 

Several trends are impossible to ignore: more 
people working than ever, an ageing population 
living and working longer and escalating levels 
of burn-out.5 The current state of the workforce, 
coupled with these trends, demands a rethink  
of employee health to avoid a potential crisis for 
health and business. A healthy workforce is not  
just a matter of corporate and societal  
responsibility; it is a strategic necessity and a 
substantial business opportunity. 

The reality that leaders face is stark: failing to 
prioritize employee health risks creating a sicker, 
unhappier and less productive workforce, burdened 
with higher healthcare costs and diminished 
productivity. The good news is that, conversely, the 
path to a healthier workforce can yield substantial 
returns for executives, investors, policy-makers 

and other stakeholders, including more robust 
organizations, vibrant communities and, ultimately, 
a healthier society. 

Guidance for developing a 
healthy workforce

This report is a call to action for leaders to recognize 
that the health and well-being of their employees 
is critical to the future success and sustainability of 
their organizations. While small actions taken today 
can build towards substantial impact tomorrow, 
many stakeholders are uncertain how to make the 
required changes in the most effective way. 

This report is structured to guide stakeholders 
on this journey, with the aim of helping them 
feel empowered and enabled to act. The first 
chapter outlines the case for investing in a healthy 
workforce, and the second delves into the current 
state of employee health and well-being globally, 
looking at how health varies by industry and by 
demographic group. The final chapters focus on 
measurement and first steps and are particularly 
geared towards executives, providing leaders with 
the tools and strategies necessary to implement 
effective health initiatives.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesThe workplace needs to foster 
holistic employee health

Companies of all sizes are entering a period in which 
it is essential to manage human capital with the 
same level of discipline as financial capital as part of 
their total business strategy. Globally, more than 3.5 
billion people will each spend approximately 90,000 
hours, or about 45 years, of their lives at work,6 
representing a major opportunity for employers to 
nurture the good health of a substantial proportion 
of the world’s population. Improved health benefits 
individuals, their families and broader society, as well 
as the organizations for which they work. 

This briefing describes why investing in workforce 
health can boost organizational performance, 
enhance employee outcomes and offer a 
substantial return on investment.

There is a clear investment case 
for improving employee health 
and well-being 

remote work.8 It also accelerated and exacerbated 
long-standing corporate challenges to employee 
health and well-being, in particular employee mental 
health, with reports of burn-out rising to almost one 
in four.9 Many employers started to actively support 
and promote brain health – not only to address 
burn-out but also because analytical thinking, a key 
marker of positive brain health, is one of the most 
sought-after skills by employers.10 

The evolution in lifespan, age-related diseases, what 
we work on and how we work will require people 
to be in better physical and mental health for longer 
and be more resilient and adaptable to change. 
The McKinsey Health Institute estimates that 
investing in holistic employee health could generate 
between $3.7 trillion and $11.7 trillion in global 
economic value.11 This equates to approximately 
$1,100 to $3,500 per person, or 17% to 55% of 
average annual pay. This estimate includes the 
impact of reduced attrition,12 absenteeism13 and 
presenteeism,14 as well as improved employee 
productivity,15 attraction and retention. The direct 
costs of medical treatments have been excluded 
because public, private and employer-sponsored 
insurance options vary by country. 

The world is changing – people are living and 
working longer, and their roles are evolving due 
to shifts in demography, advances in technology, 
globalization, and geopolitical and climate risks. 
For example, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), 
such as cardiometabolic diseases, cancers, 
substance use, and mental and neurological 
conditions account for 69% of today’s global 
disease burden. In the next 15 years, most of the 
disease categories predicted to rise will be NCDs, 
with age-related diseases such as kidney diseases 
increasing the most.7 Furthermore, the COVID-19 
pandemic created a shift in working trends, 
launching many organizations into the world of 

The biggest potential benefits come from enhancing 
productivity and reducing presenteeism, estimated 
to be worth $2 trillion to $9 trillion. This is between 
54% and 77% of the total opportunity identified 
(Figure 1). Many organizations substantially 
underestimate these potential benefits. For 
example, companies may struggle to quantify the 
costs of presenteeism, in which employees are not 
working at their full potential, and instead focus 
their investment cases on reducing direct costs, 
such as attrition and absenteeism, which are more 
easily measurable. Yet attrition and absenteeism are 
estimated to account for only between one-eighth 
and one-quarter of the total opportunity.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesAll economies benefit from 
improving the health of 
workforces, but the distribution 
of value varies 

The case for investing in employee health and 
well-being applies beyond high-income countries. 
Investment in employee health could boost global 
GDP by between 4% and 12%, with high- and 
middle-income countries each contributing roughly 
half of that total (2% to 5%) (Figure 2).16 

However, average salaries are lower in middle-
income countries,  so analysis suggests that these 
countries have up to four times as many employees 
who would benefit – an estimated 2.5 billion 
employees compared to 636 million employees in 
high-income countries.17 

The data on low-income countries was  
insufficient to reliably estimate the value at  
stake or the total number of employees  
potentially affected, but there is little doubt  
that employees in these economies would  
also benefit from workplace investment  
in health.

Within low- and middle-income countries  
(LMICs), non-communicable diseases (such  
as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes) 
meaningfully influence employee health,  
well-being and productivity. Premature deaths 
due to non-communicable diseases account  
for 80% of deaths in LMICs.18 With limited  
financial security provided by the state and  
greater pressure on workers to maintain a  
stable income and afford healthcare,  
workplaces in LMICs have a significant  
opportunity to support good employee health.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesSeveral factors directly 
contribute to the investment 
case for employee health and 
well-being within an individual 
organization

Benefits for an organization can vary widely 
depending on the number, sector and location of 
their employees (Figure 3). Consequently, when 
organizations evaluate their investment cases, they 
need to calculate all the potential benefits, including 
costs that can be avoided. 

Major factors which organizations need to  
consider as part of their investment case include 
the following:

1  Direct healthcare costs: Healthier 
workforces correlate to lower healthcare costs 
and reduced absenteeism

Although not included in the calculation of the 
economic value at stake globally, healthcare claims 
often account for the majority of an organization’s 
total employee health and well-being costs in 
countries such as the United States where employee 
health claims are subsidized by employers. In the 

United States, employers face an estimated $226 
billion annually in absenteeism costs (approximately 
$1,695 per employee), largely driven by chronic 
health conditions that could be mitigated through 
preventive care and health programmes.19 Conditions 
such as hypertension, heart disease and depression 
cause substantial on-the-job productivity losses, 
exceeding $300 per US employee annually.20 
Cardiovascular disease leads to the loss of $156 
billion in productivity annually.21 US employees with 
untreated insomnia cost employers approximately 
$2,280 more per year than those without insomnia 
because of factors such as absenteeism, 
presenteeism, diminished performance and higher 
rates of accidents and injuries.22 

A survey of more than 1,600 employer benefits 
decision-makers in the US (including C-level 
executives and human resources/benefits leaders) 
revealed that employers are preparing for medical 
inflation, with more than two-thirds budgeting for 
healthcare costs to grow at three times the rate  
of inflation.23

Globally, total healthcare costs are expected to 
continue growing because of cost pressures such as 
those related to an ageing population.24 In countries 
with universal healthcare, organizations currently 
avoid most of the direct costs of poor health, but this

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change Lives Many people with mental illness can continue working without relapse with 

appropriate support for their resilience. They can live their lives, support family, disperse 
stigma among colleagues, and contribute to corporation and society. Society needs to 
realize that people with mental illness are an asset and not a cost.

Tsuyoshi Akiyama, President, World Federation of Mental Health

could change with increasing pressure on healthcare 
budgets and the tightening of fiscal wallets. For 
these countries, the goal will likely be to maintain 
quality and accessibility across health systems while 
controlling costs. Consequently, companies may 
be asked to pay for their employees’ healthcare, 
especially if the workplace is found to be a cause of 
ill health. For example, Japan introduced the Stress 
Check Programme in 2015 to tackle an increasing 
number of work-related mental health disorders. The 
programme requires workplaces with more than 50 
employees to offer an annual stress survey and to 
facilitate consultations with a physician for those with 
high stress levels.25 

More recently, the Chilean government introduced 
a mandatory evaluation of workplace environments 
and mental health in 2024 to promote the 
accountability of employers for their employees’ 
health. The Chilean Safety Association has taken a 
leadership role in this policy change by developing 
preventive medicine, launching affordable mental 
health for communities and convening local 
organizations and leaders to collaborate on mental 
health (including the development of an annual 
Mental Health Thermometer).

Supporting employee health does not need to 
rest on employers alone and can be a joint public 
and private effort. There is no need for employers 
to reinvent the wheel: they can benefit from the 
expertise, infrastructure and goals of public health 
stakeholders through partnerships, especially as 
these stakeholders may offer referral pathways. 
For example, employers may consider partnering 
with a private, non-profit or public healthcare 
provider to offer on-site employee health clinics 
with a focus on preventive care. This could 
include cardiovascular, diabetes, cervical  
cancer or mental health screenings that give 
employees easier access to care without taking 
paid time off. Employers can also consider  
one-off events, such as a day of optional flu  
or COVID-19 shots, eye exams or specialist 
training to prevent back injuries. 

2  Productivity and presenteeism: There is 
growing evidence of a potential causal link 
between employee well-being and increased 
productivity and reduced presenteeism 

While the global investment case for improved 
productivity and reduced presenteeism offers clear 
value, calculating the gain or ROI for a specific 
programme within an individual organization can 
be more complex. The literature demonstrates, 
however, a correlation between employee well-
being interventions and productivity improvements 

of between 10% and 21%.26 Research by the 
University of Warwick found that happier employees 
are more productive,27 while a recent University of 
Oxford study found that happier employees in a call 
centre were 13% more productive.28 More high-
quality research on the causal links is needed, but 
these early insights are promising.

3  Talent management: A focus on health can 
improve employee attraction and retention

Investing in employee health and well-being can 
boost employee retention. Research from Mercer  
shows that companies which foster a “culture of 
health” experience employee turnover rates 11 
percentage points lower than those that do not.29

Moreover, investing in employee health and  
well-being is increasingly important for attracting 
talent. Research from Saïd Business School finds 
that for many employees, factors contributing to 
their well-being – such as mental and physical 
health, work-life balance and job satisfaction – 
are as crucial as traditional incentives such as 
salary.30 This is especially important for younger 
generations31 in the workforce, born between 
1996 and 2010 (also referred to as Gen Z).32 A 
McKinsey Health Institute survey of more than 
42,000 respondents found that at least a third 
consider physical, mental, social and spiritual health 
resources when choosing an employer, with Gen 
Z respondents and those with lower mental health 
scores giving particular consideration to mental 
health benefits.33 

Employers may also wish to consider how to 
promote the health of older employees. Increases 
in life expectancy and advances in healthcare 
will extend working lives: by 2050, about 30% 
of the global workforce will be over 50 years 
old.34 Governments may raise the retirement 
age or rethink pension structures in response. 
Consequently, both public and private sector 
organizations should expect an increasingly 
multigenerational workforce and tailor their health 
and well-being programmes accordingly. 

Employers’ actions are ever more visible to 
stakeholders. Platforms such as Glassdoor, Indeed, 
Fishbowl and Reddit offer employee insights into 
how organizations treat employees and support 
their well-being, potentially influencing the decisions 
of recruits, customers and investors. Data from 
these platforms can be harvested to find out 
how employees may feel and why they quit. For 
example, a recent MIT study identified toxic culture 
at the top of a workplace as a meaningful factor in 
employee resignations.35

workers and their families. A critical part of this is addressing the mental health 
challenges that our country faces. We are deploying diverse mental health initiatives 
to care for the 3 million workers that we cover. In addition, we have extended access 
to mental health care for individuals in the communities that we serve. We hope that in 
doing so, we can create healthier communities with healthier families and ultimately, 
healthier workers, improving companies’ climate and productivity.

Juan Luis Moreno, CEO, Chilean Safety Association (ACHS)

Additional factors that employers may choose to 
include in the investment case for employee health  
and well-being:

significantly outperformed major stock market 
indices since the start of 2021, demonstrating 
that high well-being scores are linked to stock 
performance (see Figure 4).37

4  Performance: A healthier, happier and 
more engaged workforce boosts company 
performance and resilience

Research from the University of Oxford shows 
a direct correlation between employee well-
being and an organization’s financial success. 
Companies with higher well-being scores 
consistently achieve greater valuations, higher 
profits and superior returns on assets. For 
example, a one-point increase in employee 
happiness scores was shown to be associated 
with a $1.39 billion to $2.29 billion increase in 
annual profits.36 A hypothetical “Well-being 100” 
stock portfolio, comprising the top  
100 companies in employee well-being, has 

Moreover, today’s workforce needs to adjust 
to new roles and technologies in a shifting job 
landscape. The rapid pace of technological change 
can be overwhelming. It can contribute to job 
insecurity and require employees to continuously 
upskill and adapt by, for example, focusing more 
on creativity, problem-solving, cognitive flexibility 
and emotional intelligence. The rise of remote 
working has blurred the lines between personal 
and professional life, creating a workplace culture 
that can enhance or harm employees’ well-being 
and productivity. A healthier workforce is a more 
resilient and adaptive workforce, better capable 
of navigating the uncertainties and challenges of a 
rapidly changing world.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change Lives5  ESG: Investors are increasingly seeing 
employee health and well-being as an 
important component of the ‘S’

6  Regulation and compliance: Regulatory 
environments may become more stringent, 
forcing employers to act

Some employers may assess the impact on 
suppliers and partners when deciding how 
to invest in employee health and well-being. 
Prioritizing holistic health is not a task to be 
undertaken alone, not least because long-term 
health investment benefits business, the workforce 
and society. Healthy individuals are more likely 
to contribute actively to their local communities 
– volunteering at the food bank, running for city 
council, coaching their child’s sports team or 
shovelling a neighbour’s driveway.38

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
criteria are becoming important aspects of 
delivering business value. They help to enhance 
revenue growth, reduce risks, minimize regulatory 
intervention and increase loyalty and productivity 
among employees. Many executives and 
investment professionals believe ESG programmes 
deliver greater shareholder value and would pay a 
premium to acquire companies with a strong ESG 
track record.39 

To date, environmental and corporate governance 
issues have dominated the ESG agenda, but 
the social pillar – which guides how companies 
manage relationships with customers, suppliers, 
communities and employees – is gaining 
consideration. Investors are increasingly paying 
attention to how companies manage employee 
health and well-being, recognizing their criticality 
to long-term organizational success. Also, there 
is growing scrutiny on labour practices, employee 
satisfaction, support for employees’ mental health 
and thinking around workforce stability. Companies 
listed on benchmarks such as the S&P 500 Index 
are now assessed not only on financial metrics but 
also on employee factors, such as job satisfaction, 
happiness, stress and purpose at work.40 Similarly, 
stock exchanges, including the Hong Kong Stock 
Exchange, are developing ESG reporting guidelines 
that mandate disclosures on employee health and 
well-being metrics, such as working hours, rest 
periods and equal opportunities.41 

Around the world, governing bodies  
increasingly recognize the importance of  
employee health and well-being, and regulatory 
pressures are mounting. For example, the 
European Union has introduced stricter standards 
for workplace well-being, such as the European 
Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work, 
the Strategic Framework on Health  
and Safety at Work 2021-2027, the Work-Life 
Balance Directive and the European Framework 
Agreement on Telework. EU regulations state  
that risk management within the workplace  
should encompass stress, thereby requiring 
psychological risk assessments and appropriate 
prevention methods.42 In the US, the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) increased 
penalties for workplace health and safety violations 
to $15,624 per violation in 2023, with non-
compliance leading to hefty fines, lawsuits and 
reputational damage. 

Adherence to these regulations reduces  
compliance risks and enhances a company’s 
reputation as a socially responsible entity.  
There is increasing expectation from consumers, 
employees and communities that organizations 
should be transparent about labour practices, 
diversity and inclusion, mental health support  
and work-life balance. Companies that fail to  
meet these expectations risk losing their  
reputation and trust among employees and 
customers alike.

The time to act is now

By prioritizing employee and health well-being, 
employers can unlock substantial performance 
gains; achieve a healthier, more adaptable and 
more resilient workforce; and drive positive change 
in their organizations and communities. Employers 
should not wait – decisive action taken today can 
secure a healthier, more productive future.

 Well-being is the ultimate productivity multiplier. And when companies invest in their 
people’s well-being, it’s a win-win — creating workplace cultures where individuals can 
maximize their productivity and creativity, which in turn enables businesses to  
grow and maximize their impact.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesBriefing 2

Current status of 
healthy workforces
No industry or demographic group is immune to 
employee burn-out, exhaustion or poor health – 
though some are more affected than others.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesWith more than half of the 
working population reporting 
suboptimal employee health, 
change is imperative 

Today’s workers face unprecedented challenges 
across sectors and geographies. Contemporary 
threats to health include a rise in mental health 
disorders and obesity; unmet needs from conditions 
such as diabetes, cancers, brain health disorders 
and cardiovascular conditions; and concerns 
about how climate change will affect food security, 
infectious diseases and access to healthcare.43

A 2023 McKinsey Health Institute survey of more 
than 30,000 employees across 30 countries44 
found that 57% of employees globally reported 
good holistic health45 (physical, social, spiritual and 
mental health),46 while a fifth of people reported 
burn-out symptoms.47 Only 49% of employees 
were “faring well”48 – meaning they had positive 
scores on holistic health and no symptoms of 
burn-out.49 There are multiple drivers of negative 
and positive health, but it is clear that the current 
state of health in workplaces is associated with 
the choices that employers and societies make. 
It is within the power of executives to build both 
healthier workforces and healthier societies. Change 
is necessary and achievable, with many ways to 
improve health within employers’ control.

All industries need to improve 
workforce health – but some 
industries have surprising results

Based on the 2023 McKinsey Health Institute 
survey, this report reveals, for the first time, the 
state of holistic health across more than 35 
industries (Figure 5).50 Encouragingly, in only 10% 
of the industries surveyed did more than a third of 
employees report burn-out symptoms. In two-
thirds of the industries, however, more than 20% 
of employees said they were burned out, and in no 
industry did more than 75% percent of employees 
say they were healthy overall.51

Employees reported higher rates of burn-out 
symptoms and lower rates of holistic health in five 
industries (reported on their percentage of faring 
well): accounting, retail, agriculture/forestry/fishing/
livestock, shipping/distribution, and arts/media/
entertainment/recreation.52 Conversely, industries 
reporting good holistic health and low burn-out 
symptoms (reported on their percentage of faring 
well) included human resources, construction, 
administrative and support services, education 
and engineering/architecture. These results reflect 
a global snapshot of a specific point in time and 
should be interpreted as a potential opportunity 
for improvement (see box “What was measured”). 
They do not mean every farmer or artist struggles 
with health, and neither do they negate any of 
the hardships a carpenter or human resources 
executive faces. Instead, this research offers new 
data points for employers seeking ways to improve 
employee health.

What was measured

From April to June 2023, the McKinsey Health Institute 
conducted a global survey of more than 30,000 employees in 
30 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, 
Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, India, 
Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, 
Nigeria, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, 
South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Türkiye, the United Arab 
Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States). The 
dimensions assessed in the survey included toxic workplace 

behaviour, interpersonal conflict, workload, work hours,  
time pressure, work pressure, physical demands, role  
conflict, role ambiguity, job insecurity, self-efficacy,  
adaptability, access to health resources, leadership 
commitment, career opportunities, career customization, 
psychological safety, supervisor support, co-worker support, 
authenticity, belonging, meaning, job autonomy, remuneration, 
person-job fit, learning and growth. Individual self-efficacy  
and adaptability were also assessed. 

16

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesThe data analysis did not reveal clear global trends 
explaining why certain industries outperform 
others.53 Nor did any single aspect of health  
drag down the average of low-performing 
industries, such as may be expected of jobs that 
are physically or emotionally demanding. Instead, 
scores were generally low or high for all four 
dimensions of health. 

The data also returned some examples that run 
counter to global trends. For example, while the 
health of front-line workers is generally worse than 
that of managers, people working in construction 
report high holistic health.54 In education and 
administrative support services, employees report 
low burn-out symptoms with high job security, 
possibly offsetting higher financial instability.

The absence of consistent patterns across 
industries suggests that for both highly and poorly 
performing sectors, the drivers of workplace health 
are multifaceted and not easily attributable to 
specific roles. 

Minority demographic groups 
form the majority and are scoring 
worse on overall employee health 

only; further contextual research is required to 
understand the underlying causes.56 

Respondents who self-identified as women, 
LGBTQI+,57 lacking a high school diploma,58 
neurodivergent59 or low-income60 reported lower 
holistic health and higher burn-out symptoms 
compared to other respondents. Notably, these 
groups make up most of the sample, not the 
minority.61 Only 20% of the employees surveyed 
did not identify with at least one of these groups 
– groups which are often underrepresented on 
executive leadership teams. This report can only 
report outcomes; more research is needed to 
understand the reasons behind those outcomes. 

Specific demographic findings include the following: 

Gender: Women were 8 percentage points  
more likely to report exhaustion symptoms  
than men (46% versus 38% for men), despite 
similar holistic health (55% versus 58% for  
men) and burn-out symptom scores (23%  
versus 21% for men). Although women  
constitute half of the global population, they  
remain underrepresented at all work levels, 
regardless of race or ethnicity,62 suggesting a  
need for targeted strategies to increase  
workplace inclusivity and reduce exhaustion. 

A much clearer story emerges from an analysis 
of demographic data, such as gender, sexual 
orientation, neurodivergence, age, education 
and income. Responses were not assessed for 
ethnic diversity because of restrictions in certain 
countries.55 This report reflects survey responses 

Among the many health conditions affecting 
women, two notable ones are endometriosis and 
menopause. Improving access to and effectiveness, 
delivery and uptake of treatments and care for those 
two conditions alone would give an annual boost of 
$130 billion to the global economy by 2040.63

reported 9 percentage points less on holistic  
health than heterosexuals (46% versus 55%  
for heterosexuals).64 An earlier McKinsey report 
found that more than half of gay, lesbian  
and nonbinary employees had stronger feelings  

of being an “only” (only person, or one of the  
only people, of their sexual orientation or  
gender identity) in the workplace than other 
employees did. Feelings of isolation can  
exacerbate exclusion and can negatively  
impact well-being.65

Neurodivergence: Neurodivergent employees 
were 24 percentage points less likely to report 
faring well scores in holistic health and burn-
out symptoms compared to neurotypical peers  
(27% versus 51% for neurotypical).66 They often 
face workplace challenges due to inadequate 
support and pressure to appear neurotypical. 
Limited data makes it difficult to fully understand 

the extent of neurodivergence in the workplace, 
but more research could help employers better 
support these employees, enhancing both their 
health and performance.67 By understanding 
and accommodating the strengths and needs 
of neurodivergent workers, organizations could 
significantly boost their capacity for innovation and 
improve overall holistic health.68

The youngest workers (aged 18 to 28) were  
18 percentage points more likely to report  
burn-out symptoms than the oldest workers 
(above age 60) (27% versus 9% for the oldest 
workers). Entering the workforce during a global 

pandemic, amid inflation, recession fears, 
geopolitical conflicts and climate change, has 
heightened anxiety for younger employees.69 In 
contrast, the extensive work (and life) experience 
of the over-60 generation may contribute to their 
improved health outcomes.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesIn the research model analysed,71 for both those 
aged 61 and over and the youngest working 
generation the top two predictors for holistic  
health are self-efficacy and meaning.72 Drivers 
of burn-out differ slightly; in this research, role 
ambiguity affects older workers most strongly, 
while a toxic workplace environment affects 
younger employees and the overall global cohort 
most strongly (Figure 7). 

These disparities highlight the importance of 
understanding differences across age groups to 
support longevity in the workplace, because  

older employees bring valuable experience, 
stability and institutional knowledge. Employers 
play a crucial role in helping employees adapt 
to longer lifespans by fostering age-diverse 
workplaces and developing products that  
meet the needs of younger and older employees. 
Research suggests that innovative workforce 
planning, including retaining older employees  
and making the most of their experience, can 
enhance organizational performance, while 
creating age-friendly jobs can help maintain a 
talented and diverse workforce.73

Notes: 1. Relative importance was conducted for exploratory reasons. While comparisons between global and group-speciﬁc drivers can be informative, actions 
taken need to consider the speciﬁc situation and context due to small sample sizes, 2. Relative importance seen above is scaled to 100%. Explained variance 
(differences in outcomes between individuals explained by regression model) for holistic health is 36% for Gen Z, 56% for Boomers/oldest working generation and 
49% for global. The explained variance for burn-out is 47% for Gen Z, 67% for Boomers/oldest working generation and 69% for global, 3. ‘Other’ includes all 
additional enablers and stressors in the research model  

Source: Relative importance analysis, MHI Employee Holistic Health Survey 2023

Educational level: College- or graduate-level 
education correlates with reported higher holistic 
health and reported lower burn-out symptoms. 
Individuals without a high school diploma were 20 
percentage points less likely to report good holistic 
health compared to those with graduate degrees 
(50% versus 70%). Research underscores the 
critical role of continuous learning and development 
in promoting overall well-being. Learning, 
development, adaptability and self-efficacy are 
core predictors of holistic employee health and vice 
versa in the underlying research model.75 

Financial situation: The survey assessed employees’ 
financial situations based on financial status,76 financial 
stability77 and remuneration.78 Only 41% of individuals 
with poor financial status reported good holistic 
health,79 compared to 76% of those with good financial 
status. Those reporting low financial stability reported 
27 percentage points lower holistic health (47% versus 
74% for financially stable) and more than 30 percentage 
points more burn-out symptoms (38% versus 5% for 
financially stable). Remuneration is positively correlated 
with holistic health. People reporting positively on 
remuneration were 30 percentage points more likely

to report higher holistic health than those reporting 
less positively on remuneration (70% versus 40% 
for lower scores on remuneration), and they also 
reported fewer symptoms of burn-out.80 

Caregiving can boost holistic 
health but is associated with 
more burn-out symptoms

Job insecurity: 45% of respondents with high job 
insecurity81 reported burn-out symptoms compared 
to the global average of 22%. Research shows job 
insecurity leads to adverse effects in mental health 
(depression, anxiety, burn-out) and physical health 
(back pain, headaches, high blood pressure).82

Job type: Being a member of upper management83 
seems to be both a blessing and a curse: 80% of 
these individuals reported good holistic health, but 
24% reported burn-out symptoms, which is higher 
than the global average of 22%. Front-line workers 
also reported higher burn-out rates (26%), driven 
by exhaustion. The top three factors associated 
with positive holistic health for managers in this 
study are self-efficacy, meaning and belonging. 
For non-managers, the top three are self-efficacy, 
adaptability and belonging.84 

More people are working while raising children, 
and more workers are taking care of adults who 
require care. Globally, the survey found that 10% 
of employees care for someone with a mental or 
physical illness in addition to their paid jobs. As 
the number of caregivers in the workforce grows, 
their role in organizations becomes increasingly 
important. Employers can benefit by understanding 
how caring for others affects overall holistic health 
and burn-out.

Caregivers were more likely to report higher 
holistic health (61% versus the global average of 
57%), driven by experiencing better social and 
spiritual health. However, caregivers were also 
17 percentage points more likely to report higher 
burn-out symptoms (37% versus 20% for non-
caregivers), primarily driven by exhaustion.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesCaregivers of children, who accounted for 
approximately 50% of the surveyed employees, 
reported even higher holistic health (64% versus 
50% for non-child caregivers), again driven by 
improved social and spiritual health. However, 
men who take care of children reported slightly 
lower burn-out symptoms compared to non-child 
caregivers (Figure 8), but women who take care of 
children experience higher exhaustion than their 
male counterparts (43% versus 35% for male 

caregivers). A recent report from Harvard Business 
School states that the burden of care still falls 
disproportionately on women, and that women 
account for a majority of “hidden workers” who 
report that their absence from the workforce is due 
to caring for children or adults. The same report 
shows that half of women who stopped working, 
despite wanting to continue, did so because they 
could not combine their career with their caregiving 
responsibilities for their children.85

The opportunity is maximized 
by helping all employees across 
diverse demographics achieve 
good health

There is no one-size-fits-all solution; leaders  
must recognize and address the varying needs  
of different groups. By doing so, they can  
develop targeted interventions that enhance  
holistic health and reduce burn-out. This approach 

may involve greater autonomy and empowerment 
for teams and individuals to manage their work and 
resources effectively. 

Employers and employees must work in partnership 
to improve health, as neither can realize the full 
benefits on their own. Employers who are not 
helping every member of their workforce achieve 
their full potential risk affecting the health and well-
being of their employees, limiting their societal and 
economic contributions and missing substantial 
value creation for their organization.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesBriefing 3A

Creating a healthier 
workforce: measuring 
the impact of investing 
in a healthy workforce 
The return on investment in employee health 
can be measured with tailored metrics that go 
beyond traditional sickness absence, safety  
and injury statistics.

23

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesTaking action: How executives 
can build the investment case for 
a healthy workforce

Many organizations offer multiple employee 
health and well-being programmes, but the 
organizational value and ROI of these programmes 
are often overlooked. Executives regularly struggle 
to answer the question, “Is our investment in 
employee health driving sustainable improvements 
in performance?” 

This briefing provides frameworks and approaches 
to help organizations develop investment cases, 
strategies and tailored action plans for successful 
health and well-being programmes and highlights 
opportunities to use data and analytics.

No single KPI can measure the 
impact of employee health and 
well-being investment 

Every industry or organization has its own unique 
characteristics, meaning there is no single KPI for 
measuring success. Metrics should be tailored to 
each organization’s specific needs. However, a 
tried-and-tested approach based on the principles 
described in Briefing 3B should work for most 
organizations, whatever their context:

1. Understand the status of employees’ health 
and well-being and the value at stake

Conducting comprehensive health and  
well-being surveys can diagnose workforce 
health needs. 

An S&P Global Corporate Sustainability 
Assessment shows that only 2.2% of assessed 
companies conduct employee surveys with a 
core focus on health and well-being.86 Smaller 
organizations can overcome potential funding 
barriers through free tools and training available 
from not-for-profit providers.

Ideally, employers measure aspects of direct health 
as experienced by employees (mental, physical, 
social and spiritual health and burn-out symptoms), 
their associated work experience outcomes (for 
example, engagement and satisfaction) and core 
work experiences (such as job demands and 
resources).87 These measurements identify both 
immediate outcomes and root causes. Employers 
can assess employee health using quick pulse 
checks,88 health assessments, automated text 
analyses of comments within annual people 
surveys, focus groups or anonymized voluntary 
health data.

Calculate the investment case opportunity for 
the organization

Good-quality, evidence-based data on employee 
health and well-being should be combined with 
an investment case to guide the development of 
strategic health interventions (see Briefing 3B). 
Organizations can build an investment case for 
employee health and well-being by focusing on 
the value drivers identified in Briefing 1. Those 
sources of value for the global economy have been 
adapted into four drivers which can be used by 
any organization to calculate their investment case 
opportunity: employee output, talent management 
optimization, healthcare cost savings and ability to 
attract investment (Figure 9).

1.  Employee output: Employee output can be 
calculated as a combination of productivity, 
absenteeism and presenteeism. Example 
metrics for each include efficiency of 
completing tasks, innovation rates, sales 
increase and customer service sentiment 
(productivity), number of workdays lost to 
sickness (absenteeism) and lost time caused 
by physically present employees working at 
reduced levels (presenteeism). For example, 
offering free flu shots gives US employers a 
potential immediate result in lower absentee 
rates. A 2021 cost-benefit analysis of employer-
funded influenza vaccinations found that 
employers could have saved €10 ($10.82) per 
vaccinated employee per year between 2011 
and 2018.89 

2.  Talent management optimization: Developing 

a strong employee value proposition can 
enhance talent attraction and retention and 
minimize employee turnover. This not only 
enriches company culture but also boosts 
business performance, as employees with 
longer tenure have between 12% and 30% 
higher output than newer employees.90 Example 
metrics include average tenure (retention), days 
required from job posting to hire (attraction) 
and involuntary attrition (turnover). For example, 
industries which have a high number of workers 
in their first job who are likely to leave because 
of burn-out symptoms or exhaustion may focus 
on digital mental health applications or other 

solutions geared to develop immediate resilience 
and track involuntary attrition. In contrast, for 
employees who are likely to stay a long time, 
virtual employee assistance options or chronic 
disease management programmes may be 
more important. In either case, organizations 
may choose to measure ROI. 

Additional elements

Organizations may also choose to build the 
following elements into their investment cases 
(where relevant):

3.  Direct healthcare costs: These include what 

an employee pays when seeking healthcare, 
what the employer covers under any employer-
sponsored insurance and any costs associated 
with work-related injuries. These costs are often 
major for organizations that have employees in 
economies with private healthcare systems.

4.  ESG premium: An organization that highlights 
good employee health and well-being as part  
of its culture and value proposition may make 
itself more attractive to investors, customers 
and partners. 

5.  Investment case for contractors and 

suppliers: Some organizations may also 
choose to include the impact on contractors 
and suppliers within their investment cases. 
Employers can also consider how to expand 

25

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change Livesinterventions in ways that benefit employees 
both within their organizations and within 
the broader local community. For example, 
executives in organizations with a global 
presence may consider how to invest in 
widescale health education outreach.  
One example is Bayer’s support for  
mallholder farmers, who represent 11% of  
their Crop Science’s divisional sales. The 
company is introducing access to health  
and nutrition education for members of 
their value chain (including farmers) in India, 
Indonesia and Mexico. This initiative aims 
to improve health outcomes and productivity 

by directly supporting farmers and their 
associated communities.

Overall, to build the investment case effectively, 
estimates need to assess the value of making the 
investment (costs avoided and benefits gained) 
versus the cost of the intervention required to 
address the issue. 

Figure 10 provides sample metrics that can be  
used to gather data on each of the drivers 
of employee output and talent management 
optimization, as these two elements are at the  
core of any business case.

Novo Nordisk provides support and targeted 
interventions to teams reporting high stress levels 

Healthcare company Novo Nordisk regularly 
deploys a global survey to measure employee 
stress levels and mental health using validated 
screening questions. About 14% of the company’s 
64,000 employees reported symptoms of stress 
in the 2023 survey. Managers of highly stressed 
teams receive support from organizational 
psychologists and are trained to use well-being 

tools effectively, adhering to the IGLO (individual, 
group, leaders and organization) model.91 Stronger 
support interventions generally demonstrate a 
20% to 30% decline in the number of employees 
reporting symptoms of stress one to two years 
after the intervention. Novo is now implementing 
a similar survey focusing on physical health, 
particularly pain.

On achieved 11.6x ROI annually ($2.9 million) 
through employee health intervention

Sportswear company On implemented an 
employee health intervention, via Kyan Health,  
to over 2,500 employees within their organization. 
The intervention gave employees access to a self-
care library (including mediation, relaxation and 
breathing practices), 12 coaching sessions and 
internal well-being workshops. Since its  
launch in 2022, 1,240 employee have created 

accounts representing an approximate 50% 
uptake. The intervention has gained the company 
$2.9 million annually (11.6x ROI). This consists 
of $1.3 million productivity gains due to 5% 
improvement in presenteeism related productivity 
loss, $1.1 million driven by 30% reduction in 
voluntary attrition and $0.5 million reduction in HR 
costs to manage mental health cases globally.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change Lives2. Develop initiatives for a sustainable  
healthy workforce

Executives may consider how to use the  
baseline and investment case created using  
the above principle to develop a targeted 
intervention strategy aligned with the overall 
organizational strategy. When developing an 

initiative portfolio, organizations should  
consider their current initiatives to understand  
how much is currently spent on employee health 
and well-being, how effective they are and where 
there is room for growth. The initiatives can be 
focused on direct employees or include suppliers 
and the wider communities from which the 
workforce is drawn.

Swiss Re’s metabolic health programme targeted 
interventions based on an onboarding survey

Reinsurance provider Swiss Re partnered with 
Combe Grove (a metabolic health centre) and 
Gro Health (a digital well-being platform) to deliver 
a pilot programme focused on optimizing the 
metabolic health of their 1,100 UK employees. The 
intervention began with a survey on risk factors 
for metabolic ill health – the primary cause of 
many chronic diseases which today contribute 
to the majority of global ill health and deaths 
(including heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, 
musculoskeletal diseases and mental ill health) 
– that asked employees about their motivations 
to participate. More than 220 employees 
participated in the survey, and many more have 
since accessed the diverse resource offerings, 
including a digital well-being platform focusing on 
nutrition, sleep, exercise and mental well-being. 
Forty individuals (identified from the risk factor 
survey) participated in one-on-one health planning 

sessions and a further five completed a seven-
day residential programme with virtual follow-up 
support for 12 months.

With full pilot outcomes expected in May 2025, 
interim results indicate that the programme is very 
relevant (59% of surveyed employees showed 
some degree of metabolic ill health and were 
highly motivated to improve this), and that the 
intervention is effective: high-risk participants 
achieved an average of 6% body weight loss, 
20% improvement in blood fat profile and 50% 
improvement in well-being, sleep and diet 
quality. As well as these clinical improvements, 
wider programme rollout post-pilot will aim to 
demonstrate on a broader scale the day-to-day 
impact many colleagues have noted: “My energy 
has increased”, “I’m sleeping better”, “I’m more 
focused at work”.

Novartis Foundation funded cardiovascular 
health interventions in Senegal 

The Novartis Foundation funded the Better 
Hearts Better Cities initiative, which was 
designed to improve cardiovascular health 
in Dakar, Senegal. The programme provided 
education about healthy lifestyles, including 
information about blood pressure, diet, physical 

activity, stress and tobacco use and was 
delivered in collaboration with 18 companies, 
reaching 36,000 employees. Outcomes included 
hypertension screening of 21,000 employees  
and improved blood pressure for 34% to 39%  
of employees in six months. 

28

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change Lives3. Use pilots to test the effectiveness of  
an intervention

Pilots help organizations test interventions on  
a small scale before full implementation,  helping 
to justify investments and refine interventions.  
They can compare intervention and non-
intervention groups or assess pre- and post-
intervention outcomes within specific employee 
subgroups or locations. Metrics such as adoption 

rate, direct impact on employee health and  
well-being (for example, anonymous and  
voluntary data on health scores), distress levels 
and burn-out symptoms, cost analysis, and  
ROI can all be used to measure success. 
Investment returns can be measured by  
comparing the cost of the intervention with 
outcomes. Some companies also look at  
cultural ROI, such as improvements in employee 
sentiment or scores from experience surveys.

ASICS piloted a Movement for Mind intervention 

To address the potential inactivity of desk-bound 
employees, often caused by insufficient time, 
facilities or motivation to be active, sportswear 
company ASICS developed the Movement for 
Mind initiative. The programme is an audio series 
with movement instructions for all fitness levels, 
aimed at improving mental health through a 
range of techniques. Participants listened to two 
30-minute sessions per week for eight weeks. 
Initially piloted with 189 people (including but not 

limited to ASICS staff), the programme showed 
clinically significant improvements in mental well-
being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being 
scale and WHO-5), low mood (PHQ-2 scale) 
and anxiety (GAD-2 scale). Of those taking part 
in the pilot, 71% said they felt happier and 70% 
reported being more active after completing 
the programme. Following this successful pilot, 
the initiative recruited nearly 3,000 additional 
participants worldwide over an 18-month period.92

4. Monitor employee health and well-being 
improvements over time 

Regular, ongoing monitoring helps ensure that 
interventions are effective, identifies areas for 
adjustment and helps organizations track progress 
and assess the impact of employee health and 

well-being programmes. Depending on their starting 
point, organizations can tailor their approach. 
Those starting on this journey can begin with a few 
data points and refine measurement over time, 
while advanced organizations may be able to use 
advanced analytics and modelling, depending on 
their resource levels.

Wellhub shows that interventions become self-reinforcing 
when adoption rates are more than 20% to 25% 

Wellhub, a wellness platform, connects clients’ 
employees to physical, mental and nutritional 
interventions, such as local gyms and meditation 
apps. Tracking more than 15,000 employees 
over time, Wellhub found an average adoption 
rate of 15% to 25%, but clients in the top quartile 
achieved a 40% to 70% adoption rate and an 
average year-on-year adoption rate growth of 
approximately 42%. Wellhub’s study suggests 
that fostering a healthy workforce culture could 
increase the adoption of employee health and 
well-being interventions by up to 12 times 

compared to simply offering the intervention. 
The platform finds that interventions surpassing 
an adoption rate of 20% to 25% tend to be 
self-reinforcing. One possible explanation is that 
when at least one in five employees participate, 
a microsociety of participants forms, which starts 
changing the organization to become healthier. 
Practically, this means colleagues influence 
each other, share recommendations on helpful 
interventions or invite each other to attend workout 
classes together, all of which help foster a thriving, 
healthy workforce culture.

Audi introduces Checkup programme, 
reaching 10,000 employees

Audi, a German automotive manufacturer, began 
its Audi Checkup programme in 2006 to enable 
employees to identify their health risks and help 
prevent chronic illnesses. More than 90% of 
employees opt in to the voluntary examination and 

preventive programme. The 75-minute check-up 
includes blood tests, an electrocardiogram, biometry, 
tissue analysis, a lung test, an eye test, a hearing test 
and the SF-12® Health Survey. Since 2006, more 
than 10,000 employees have taken part.93

People and organization 
analytics are an important 
enabler of successful employee 
health and well-being strategies

Integrating employee health and well-being into 
core organizational strategies is crucial. Robust 
information management and people and 
organization analytics approaches help achieve this. 
Organizations often track financial and supply chain 
metrics, but many overlook comprehensive health 
and well-being data. Rapid advancements in data 
infrastructure, analytics and AI, however, are helping 
to bridge this gap. A recent McKinsey global 
survey of more than 1,200 respondents found that 
12% are regularly using generative AI in HR and 
seeing meaningful cost reductions.94 “Big data” 
can be collected and, provided it is of good quality 

and appropriate privacy standards are in place, 
can be used for predictive analysis. It could help 
guide decision-making on effective interventions 
by providing a view of upstream drivers, real-time 
indicators and key enablers to improve employee 
health and well-being.95 As data analytics evolve, 
now is the time to incorporate health metrics into 
organizational measurements. 

Beyond analytics, high-quality AI-enabled systems 
can enhance employees’ understanding of health 
benefits, streamline onboarding and scheduling, 
and increase flexibility. They can even assist leaders 
in improving workplace interactions and provide 
real-time feedback to employees. Participation 
could be boosted by allowing employees to track 
their health status through innovative tools such  
as opt-in wearables. This not only promotes well-
being but also fosters a culture of health within  
the organization.

Experian reduces global attrition, saving $14 million over 
two years, by using predictive workforce analytics

Experian, a data analytics and consumer credit 
reporting company, faced resignation rates 4% 
above the industry benchmark, creating a strain on 
growth and innovation. Initially, Experian looked to 
tackle this by focusing on recruitment and simply 
managing the high resignation rates, resulting in 
decreased attention to workplace initiatives for the 
existing workforce.

Subsequently, Experian turned to data analytics. By 
using HR data and in-house analytics capabilities, 

the company developed a solution that equipped 
global HR teams with advanced insights into 
employee needs and motivation, enabling tailored 
approaches to support employee health and well-
being. The platform analyses up to 200 employee 
attributes (including core HR and people data) to 
create a comprehensive assessment of the risk that 
employees will leave. HR teams can now make 
informed decisions on the most effective support 
for employees, reducing global attrition by 4% and 
saving Experian $14 million over two years.96 

Lack of data is not a constraint 
to acting

Lack of data should not be an excuse for inaction 
by executives. Organizations can tailor metrics 
to meet their unique needs much like individuals 
tackle improving their own health: they may start by 

measuring how much physical activity they do in a 
week, how many hours they spend on social media 
or how much water they consume in a day. Any 
journey to improvement must start with a baseline. 
Executives have an exciting opportunity to leverage 
health metrics to improve sustainable performance, 
enhance employee well-being and foster a thriving 
organizational culture.

full workforce potential. 

31

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesBy taking decisive steps towards building a 
healthy workforce, organizations will not only 
benefit employees but also enhance performance. 
Executives often view employee health and 
well-being programmes as a cost rather than as 
a strategic opportunity with a positive ROI. This 
report aims to change that. Yet, many executives 
would not know where to begin even if they were 
convinced of the need for change.

Where to start? Six principles to 
address employee health 

Each organization has unique needs and 
opportunities to address employee health and 
well-being, based on size, organizational set-up, 
geographic spread and level of resources.  
This report suggests six simple principles  
each organization could follow to create a 
successful employee health and well-being 
intervention portfolio:

1.  Understand the baseline and value at stake: 
As described in Briefing 3A, start by assessing 
the baseline health status of employees through 
surveys. Alongside the baseline, it is important 
for each organization to understand the 
potential value of revising a workforce strategy 
and the risks associated with doing nothing.

2.  Develop initiatives for a sustainable healthy 
workforce: One-off efforts will not build a 
healthy workforce. Achieving sustainable results 
requires a long-term, systemic approach with 
high-quality, evidence-based interventions.97 
This should be complemented by a clear 
vision of what the organization is attempting 
to solve, leading to a targeted approach to 
improving health, in alignment with the overall 
organizational strategy. Short-term projects 
may yield immediate benefits, but real change 
comes from a complete plan that includes clear 
leadership behaviours and effective tools. The 
updated strategy can then build on current 
efforts, such as programmes focused on 
diversity and inclusion and psychological well-
being. This strategy should be sponsored by the 
board and empower lower-level teams to drive 
autonomous, aligned interventions.

3.  Pilot interventions to test and learn: Deploy, 
test and learn. Set up pilot programmes to 
try out and refine strategies. This allows for 
targeted testing, continuous improvement, 
learning from failures and ensuring that only 
the most effective interventions are scaled. 
Begin with small, manageable programmes 
addressing immediate needs to start building 
momentum and create longer-term impact. 
Interventions do not need to be complicated – 
simple actions, such as encouraging employees 
to take “movement breaks” during work or 
training managers to discuss mental health 
with their teams, can be highly effective. Shift 
away from offering reactive interventions at an 
individual level in favour of implementing more 
proactive interventions, especially those aimed 
at teams. 

4.  Track three to five metrics to measure 

success: Start with three to five KPIs that 
drive workforce health and organizational 
performance, ideally ones already tracked or 
easy to implement.98 Refine these KPIs for 
optimal insights. Assess broader effects by 
updating the investment case and re-surveying 
employee health. Use these insights to steer 
the strategy – whether that means stopping, 
redirecting or scaling interventions. Systematic 
measurement validates the investment in a 
healthy workforce.

5.  Ensure leadership commitment and 

sponsorship: Real change starts in the 
boardroom with executives making employee 
health and well-being a strategic priority. 
Executives must set the vision, hold themselves 
accountable and integrate health and well-
being into the core organizational strategy. 
They should also nominate an executive-team 
sponsor and a board sponsor as a signal of 
leadership commitment. The sponsor does not 
need to be the chief HR, people or medical 
officer; it can be very powerful if another 
executive takes the sponsor role. Executives will 
need to be transparent in their communication 
and authentic in how they role model. They also 
need participate in health initiatives to create a 
supportive environment where employees feel 
encouraged to engage and be open about their 
health challenges.

 As the executive sponsor of the well-being agenda at Standard Chartered,  

I believe that well-being at work is at the core of employee engagement and 
productivity. We want our people to feel able to bring their best selves to work and 
deliver sustainable high performance. I am passionate about using my role to help 
create a positive and healthy work environment. This means listening to colleagues 
about their needs and supporting them to build well-being-related skills – such as 
resilience and adaptability, empathy, and personal energy management. Having an 
executive sponsor outside of the traditional HR setting demonstrates that well-being  
is for everyone and it’s a shared responsibility.

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change Lives6.  Embed employee health into organizational 
culture: Creating a sustainable and healthy 
workforce is a long-term journey requiring a 
systemic shift in organizational mindset and 
culture. Employee health must be integral 
to everyday work life and embedded in daily 
practices, management analytics, leadership 
behaviours, the deployment of digital tools, 
policies and values. This cultural shift demands 

continuous engagement, regular evaluation 
and flexible interventions to meet needs as they 
evolve. This approach will help break down 
some barriers, such as privacy concerns from 
employees or stigma about mental health. 
Fostering a culture of health and well-being is 
not just about immediate outcomes; it is about 
building resilience and long-term sustainability in 
the organization.

Ikea Canada implements Wellness Days, reducing 
employee turnover from 35% to 24.5%

Furniture and home-goods company Ikea 
Canada found through its 2019 annual employee 
engagement survey that employees cited family 
obligations, personal illness and stress and 
that employees wanted a healthier lifestyle. In 
2020, the company introduced Wellness Days, 
allowing employees to take 12 days off per year 
for personal illness or injury, supporting a family 
member with an illness or injury, taking care of a 
personal emergency, participating in a community 

event, volunteering at a not-for-profit organization, 
self-care, inclement weather, or spending time 
with loved ones or a new pet. In response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, it partnered with the 
Mental Health Commission of Canada to introduce 
training and a digital programme that develops 
self-care, self-leadership, resilience and 
mindfulness practice. Executives have credited the 
focus on mental health with contributing to a drop 
in employee turnover from 35% to 24.5%.99

Create a portfolio of evidence-
based interventions for a 
sustainable healthy workforce

Many employers care deeply about their 
employees’ health and well-being, introducing 
interventions designed to help, including yoga 
classes, meditation apps, wellness days and 
awareness campaigns. Often, however, the  
portfolio of interventions is not a coherent whole 
that significantly moves the needle to address 
specific workforce needs. To make interventions 
effective, employers must understand and 
proactively address employees’ needs at the 
individual, team and organizational level.  
Companies often provide ways to help  

individual employees, but mental health apps  
and gym access alone are not enough if systemic 
problems remain. 

So where does a chief executive officer/chief human 
resources officer/chief people officer/chief medical/
health officer start if they want to create a portfolio 
of effective interventions? How can leaders select 
the right evidence-based employee health and well-
being interventions?

The ideal portfolio aims to address both immediate 
needs (reactive) and root causes (proactive) 
and is made up of a complementary variety of 
interventions, some of which are designed to help 
individuals and teams, some to reshape jobs and 
some to change the organization (Figure 11).

The reason a portfolio approach is important is  
that work and health-related outcomes are 
influenced by both enablers and drivers.101 Enablers 
are the aspects that can provide positive energy, 
such as meaningful work and psychological 
safety. In comparison, demands are challenges at 
work that require sustained cognitive, physical or 
emotional effort, such as toxic workplace behaviour 
and role ambiguity. 

Holistic health is most strongly influenced by 
enablers, such as the employee experience 
of having self-efficacy, adaptability, feelings of 
belonging, meaningful work and psychological 
safety. Interventions that address these drivers 
include self-efficacy and adaptability training, 
purpose workshops, and psychological-safety 
leadership and team training. Other interventions to 
support holistic health include workplace nutrition 
programmes, peer mentoring, job crafting and 
physical-activity nudges. 

In contrast, burn-out symptoms are more strongly 
associated with demands, such as the employee 
experience of toxic workplace behaviour, role 
ambiguity and role conflict. Interventions related to 
these drivers focus on eliminating toxic behaviours, 

making roles clearer and helping teams and 
team leaders reduce confusion and role conflict. 
Additional interventions include offering high-quality 
mental health awareness training, managing teams’ 
ways of working, creating space for recovery and 
adjusting roles to enhance control and autonomy.

The best place for an organization to start 
addressing demands and building enablers for 
employees is at the team and job levels.102 Notably, 
team-level drivers are predictive of both holistic 
health and burn-out symptoms. Middle managers 
are crucial to team health and well-being, serving 
as the link between leadership and employees.103 
Their engagement is vital for the successful 
implementation of employee health and well-being 
interventions. Empowering and training middle 
managers to prioritize the health and well-being 
of their teams can unlock employee growth and 
productivity. Investing in middle management pays 
off: research shows that organizations with top-
performing middle managers generate 3 to 21 times 
more in total shareholder returns.104 Additionally, 
including employees in the decision-making 
process through surveys, focus groups and well-
being committees ensures that subsequent actions 
meet their needs and realities.

Vitality provides personalized health interventions 
to create a healthier workforce

Vitality is a health and life insurer whose well-
being strategy for employees comprises five 
pillars – physical, mental, social, financial and 
lifestyle – and features on-site health checks, 
mental health counselling, mental health 
awareness training for managers, lunchtime 
leadership walks and life-stage-specific medical 
support. The Vitality Programme provides 
incentives and rewards for employees to take 
actions that support healthier living, and 72% of 
participants report that the programme inspired 
them to make positive lifestyle changes. Vitality’s 
Next Best Action feature alerts members and 

employees to the one action that would have 
the biggest impact on their health, based on the 
results of their annual online health review, and 
directs them in how to make this change. 

The organization’s focus on employee well-being 
has delivered a healthier, happier, more productive 
workforce, reflected in employee experience 
survey outcomes. Vitality research shows that 
employees who are highly engaged with the Vitality 
Programme lost 50% fewer days to presenteeism, 
recorded 28% fewer absences and took 46% less 
time to recover from sickness.

Each organization is unique, and tailoring 
interventions accordingly is crucial for improving 
overall employee well-being. The good news is that 
this often involves investing smarter rather than 
more. To realize the full potential of their workforce, 
organizations should develop a strategic portfolio 
of health investments that address poor health 

and promote well-being. Leaders should commit 
to long-term, systemic approaches, supported 
by evidence-based interventions and proactive 
involvement at all organizational levels. True 
progress requires smart investment that tackles 
both symptoms and root causes, fostering a 
healthier and more productive workforce. 

35

Thriving Workplaces: How Employers can Improve Productivity and Change LivesConclusion

Work is a cornerstone of many people’s lives. 
However, it should not leave people less happy, 
less healthy or less fulfilled. Physical, mental, 
social and spiritual well-being is intricately tied to 
work, productivity and performance. Investing in 
employee health and well-being is both an ethical 
obligation and a strategic organizational imperative 
with tangible returns. 

This report offers a plan that goes beyond the 
behaviour of individuals. It sets out the mechanism 
for changing a company’s culture, addressing 
specific workplace requirements and improving 
health and well-being at every level of the 
organization – thereby developing a healthier, more 
productive workforce. It shows why prioritizing a 
healthy workforce is essential and beneficial, as 
well as providing practical guidance that will help 
employers feel enabled and empowered to seize 
the opportunity. 

Firstly, the case for investing in holistic employee 
health is substantial. With more than 3.5 billion 
people dedicating a substantial portion of their 
lives to work, the workplace plays a crucial role in 
fostering holistic health. Investing in health presents 
a global economic value opportunity worth 17% 
to 55% of average annual pay per employee. 
Organizations that invest are likely to reduce 
healthcare costs, enhance productivity, improve 
talent management, boost company performance 
and strengthen organizational resilience. 
Increasingly, investors are emphasizing employee 
health and well-being as a crucial component of 
the social element of ESG criteria, recognizing its 
impact on long-term organizational success and 
shareholder value. Regulatory pressures are also 
mounting globally, with stricter standards and 
compliance requirements being introduced to 
ensure workplace well-being, such as those from 
the EU and the United States’ OSHA. Applying 
these rules not only reduces the risk of breaking 
them but also improves a company’s reputation 
as socially responsible. This helps meet growing 
demands for transparency made by consumers, 
employees and communities.

Secondly, disparities in holistic health and burn-
out symptoms across various industries and 
demographics underscore the need for tailored 
interventions. Employees who identify as women, 

LGBTQI+, younger, neurodivergent, or with lower 
levels of education or income report poorer health 
outcomes than their counterparts. It is therefore 
important to understand the root causes of poorer 
health and create inclusive workplaces. A one-
size-fits-all approach will not reap the full rewards; 
leaders must recognize and address the needs 
of different demographic groups and develop 
targeted interventions that enhance holistic health 
and reduce burn-out. Employers and employees 
must work in partnership to improve health, as 
neither can achieve the best results on their own. 
Unless employers help all employees achieve their 
full potential, they risk limiting the health and well-
being of their workforce, restricting their societal 
and economic contributions, and missing out on 
substantial value creation for their organization.

Finally, leaders should address workforce health by 
taking a strategic approach, committing to making 
smart investments that tackle both symptoms and 
root causes and measuring the impact of those 
investments over time.

Returns on investment can be evaluated using 
customized metrics that extend beyond the 
traditional markers of sickness, absence, disease, 
safety and injury. A four-step approach to 
building an investment case requires employers 
to understand the status of employee health and 
well-being within the organization, calculate the 
investment case opportunity, use pilot programmes 
to measure intervention effectiveness, and monitor 
improvements over time. Advances in data analytics 
and artificial intelligence (AI) offer substantial 
opportunities to integrate health metrics into core 
organizational strategies. For example, AI could 
be used to translate specific workplace safety 
information, customize health-emergency protocols 
for a building, or aggregate reputably sourced 
health tips and links into an employee newsletter. 

In conclusion, leaders should recognize that 
creating a healthier workforce is not an isolated 
goal but a foundation of organizational performance 
and resilience. By prioritizing employee health, 
organizations can transform work into a source of 
life enhancement, unlock human potential and reap 
financial benefits. This report provides the evidence 
and tools for leaders to feel empowered and 
enabled to take those crucial steps today.

A self-assessment survey with comparative analysis. Responses may vary because the survey is based on self- 
assessment by individual employees and because individuals can, for example, be more likely to report symptoms of 
exhaustion rather than other aspects of burn-out symptoms, as the former may be more socially acceptable.

Definitions of holistic health elements according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Total holistic health data 
represents the percentage of respondents who reported an average of four or more per sub-dimension or an average of 
four or more across the four dimensions of health.

Data on mental, physical, social and spiritual health represents the percentage of respondents scoring an average 
of four or more on a five-point scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree) on items for each 
dimension. Data on holistic health represents the percentage of respondents scoring an average of four or more across 
all dimensions.

respondents scoring an average of three or more on a five-point scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often, always) on 
items for each dimension. Data on burn-out symptoms represent the percentage of respondents scoring an average 
of three or more across all four dimensions (12 items of the short-BAT see: Burnout Assessment Tool. (n.d.). https://
burnoutassessmenttool.be/start_eng/).

The percentage of those “faring well” is represented by respondents reporting low burn-out symptoms and high holistic 
health as explained in Brassey, J. et al. (2023). Reframing employee health: Moving beyond burn-out to holistic health. 
McKinsey & Company. https://www.mckinsey.com/mhi/our-insights/reframing-employee-health-moving-beyond-
burnout-to-holistic-health.

Data on total burn-out symptoms represents the percentage of respondents who reported an average of three or more 
per subdimension (exhaustion, cognitive impairment, emotional impairment and mental distance) or across all 12 items 
constituting overall burn-out symptoms.

Based on Dynata taxonomy.

Burn-out refers to employees reporting burn-out symptoms, including the following: exhaustion, mental distance, 
cognitive impairment and emotional impairment, as measured by the Burn-out Assessment Tool (BAT). Employee health 
refers to employees self-reporting their holistic health, including mental, physical, social and spiritual health. See Brassey, 
J. et al. (2023). Reframing employee health: Moving beyond burn-out to holistic health. McKinsey Health Institute.

Not all industries could be included in the analysis due to insufficient data points caused by, for example, low sample size. 

For many of the subgroup analyses, sample size becomes too small to draw strong conclusions or perform advanced 
analytics. Because outcomes and context can vary between groups and situations, it is recommended that organizations 
establish their own baseline measurements in context to identify potential opportunities for improvement.

For example, mental health challenges may be more pronounced in certain countries or industries compared to others. 
Since the focus here is on holistic health functioning and burn-out symptoms, specific mental health issues may not be 
immediately evident in the global data. For instance, addiction and substance use are known to be significant problems 
among US construction workers. See: Kaliszewski, M. (2024, 23 August). Construction Workers & Addiction: Statistics, 
Recovery & Treatment. American Addiction Centres. https://americanaddictioncenters.org/workforce-addiction/blue-
collar/construction-workers.

The examination of different demographic factors varied by country due to various limitations. In some cases, definitions 
were unclear or not aligned, and in others, country regulations imposed restrictions. As a result, several demographic 
factors are excluded from the global analysis. 

The varying sample sizes for industries globally poses a challenge, as differences in response style can influence results 
– e.g. if a country with a high survey response style bias has an uneven spread in the specific sample or subsample, it 
could skew results positively or negatively. Future research needs to explore these nuances. 

Groups were identified based on responses to the question “What is your sexual orientation?” Response options included 
the following: heterosexual or straight, homosexual (gay or lesbian), bisexual, not listed and don’t know/not applicable. 
Due to country restrictions, data could not be collected from Egypt, Indonesia, India, Nigeria, Saudi Arabi, South Africa or 
the United Arab Emirates. 

Lower education defined as no high school degree.

Divergent respondents self-identified as having a neurodevelopmental condition, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyspraxia, Tourette syndrome or any other neurodevelopmental condition 
(diagnosed or not diagnosed). This was gathered via the question “Have you been diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental 
condition such as ASD, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, Tourette syndrome or any other neurodevelopmental condition?” 
Response options included “yes”, “no”, “I think I have a neurodevelopmental condition but have not been diagnosed”, 
and “don’t know/not applicable”.

Remuneration score based on combined scoring of three statements – for example, “The pay I receive at my job is 
enough to cover my basic needs (e.g. housing, food, utilities, transport)”.

In this survey, population-representative samples were collectec across 30 countries, matching country-specific targets 
on six quota variables: age, gender, tertiary education, industry, position (blue collar versus white collar versus manager) 
and employer size (number of employees). Additional quotas were added based on the country (e.g. race, region in the 
US, language).

The sample size for non-cisgender individuals in the survey was too small for a separate analysis. However, when 
comparing cisgender men with non-cisgender individuals (including those self-identifying as women, transgender women, 
transgender men, genderqueer and others), significant differences in employee health emerged: cisgender men reported 
better overall health compared to non-cisgender individuals.

Self-efficacy was measured using three items of the Schwarzer Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (see: Schwarzer, R., 
Jerusalem, M. (1995). The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE). Free University of Berlin). The items included were “I am 
confident that I could deal efficiently with unexpected events”, “Thanks to my resourcefulness, I know how to handle 
unforeseen situations” and “I can remain calm when facing difficulties because I can rely on my coping abilities”.

“Drivers” means predictive correlations as tested in an extensive regression model. It does not mean causal, as the 
results were collected with one survey instrument at the same time. Employee experience factors based on the job 
demands and resources model were regressed on outcomes such as burn-out symptoms and holistic health in a similar 
way to a previous publication: Brassey, J. et al. (2023). Reframing employee health: Moving beyond burn-out to holistic 
health. McKinsey Health Institute.

Financial status was measured by the question: “What best describes your financial situation?”. Possible answers were “I 
face serious hardship”, “I can get by with current resources”, “I live comfortably but cannot afford to indulge”, “I can live 
comfortably and indulge in activities I like” and “Prefer not to answer”.

Financial stability was measured with the combined scoring of five negatively framed items (e.g. “I don’t have money left 
over at the end of the month”). Responses were reported on a five-point scale: strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree 
nor disagree, agree and strongly agree. Low financial stability is represented by a consistent combined agree/strongly 
agree score. Financial stability was represented by respondents with a consistent combined strongly disagree and 
disagree score.   

Remuneration was measured with the combined scoring of three items: “The pay I receive at my job is enough to cover my 
basic needs (e.g. housing, food, utilities, transport)”, “My company pays me enough to feel financially secure” and “My pay 
is sufficient to support myself and/or my family”. Responses were reported on a five-point scale: strongly disagree, disagree, 
neither agree nor disagree, agree and strongly agree. The result was taken as an average across the three answers. 
Respondents with a consistent ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘disagree’ score were reported as low remuneration (or as described 
in the text: ‘reported less positively on remuneration’). Respondents with a consistent ‘agree’ and ‘strongly agree’ score 
were reported as high remuneration (or as described in the text: ‘reported positively on remuneration’). 

Financial status was measured with the question “What best describes your financial situation?”. Possible answers were 
“I face serious hardship”, “I can get by with current resources”, “I live comfortably but cannot afford to indulge”, “I can 
live comfortably and indulge in activities I like” and “Prefer not to answer”. Poor financial status are those respondents 
that chose: “I face serious hardship” compared to respondents that report good financial status and chose: “I can live 
comfortably and indulge in activities I like”

Job insecurity was measured by respondents’ responses to the question, “I feel like there is a good chance I could lose 
my job”. Responses were reported on a five-point scale: strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree 
and strongly agree. Those who responded one or two reported low financial security. Those who responded four or five 
reported high job insecurity.

of workplace behavioral health, vol. 34, no. 2, pp. 96-110. https://doi.org/10.1080/15555240.2019.1600409.

Measured with the question “Which of the following best describes your current role at your employer?”. Possible 
answers were front-line worker, individual contributor, frontline manager, middle management or upper management.

Belonging means that individuals report feeling connected with others at work and that they feel like they belong at 
their company. Meaning is defined as employees reporting that their work gives them a sense of purpose, they find 
meaning in their work every day and they feel a sense of accomplishment through their work. Adaptability refers to an 
employee’s underlying potential to effectively adjust or anticipate task-related, environmental and vocational demands. 
Adaptability comprises three components: cognitive, affective and behavioural. In McKinsey Health Institute’s survey, 
affective adaptability was measured by: van Dam, K. Meulders, M. (2020). The Adaptability Scale: Development, internal 
consistency, and initial validity evidence. European Journal of Psychological Assessment, vol. 37, no. 2.

evidence. For an example of what these surveys may include, see: Brassey, J. et al. (2023). Reframing employee health:

Institute. These percentages are an indication and based on the research model of the research performed by McKinsey 
Health Institute. Naturally, emphasis for different levels and drivers is related to the designed research model. In this 
research, demands at the team and job level were more strongly represented in the constructs measured, whereas the 
constructs included on enablers had a wider spread across four levels: individual, job, team and organization. Every 
organization needs to do its own investigation of what is most relevant to it and its unique contexts, though insights from 
a well-researched model such as the job demands and resources model, may be helpful reference to get started.
