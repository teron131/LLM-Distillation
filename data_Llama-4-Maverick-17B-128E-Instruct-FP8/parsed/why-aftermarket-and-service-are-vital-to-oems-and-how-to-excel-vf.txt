Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel Introduction

Whether manufacturers serve consumers, other businesses, 
or governments, the aftermarket and service matter. For 
many OEMs, what began as a relatively unsophisticated side 
business selling spare parts now contributes to a majority of 
their margins: these can be up to four times as high as they 
are for new units. This pattern is evident among top market 
performers, as companies that have excelled in the aftermarket 
and service have been strongly rewarded over the past 
15 years, with double the TSR of companies that don’t focus on 
service (Exhibit 1).

The importance of aftermarket and service has been more 
differentiating and acute amid recent economic conditions, in 
which uncertainty, high inflation, and high interest rates have 
pushed many companies to postpone capital investments. 
Generally, capital expenditures are higher when investing in 
new production lines compared with aftermarket and service, 
such as maintenance or upgrades to the existing installed 
base. At the same time, the increasing prevalence of firmware-
driven updates across industries has further reduced the usual 
need for up-front capital investment required for aftermarket 
and service, while also limiting disruptions to activities such 
as manufacturing. Consequently, companies facing budget 
constraints may prioritize spending on aftermarket and service 
purchases over investing in new units, thereby increasing the 
importance of aftermarket and service in their overall revenue-
generation strategy.

Despite its commercial and strategic value, aftermarket and 
service are often largely untapped. Service excellence—
defined as an ongoing commitment to providing customers 
with outstanding and relevant support and services well 
beyond the initial sale—can help.

McKinsey & Company

In part 1 of this report, we offer a five-part framework for how 
to divide the offerings for the aftermarket and service journey, 
from idea to payment: 

1. 

Innovation-to-market stage. This spans the development 
process and ends with launching an offering into 
the market.

2.  Market-to-order stage. This covers the process  

from business development to the completion of a 
customer’s order.

3.  Order-to-delivery stage. This spans procurement, 

manufacturing, and product delivery.

credit management that smooths the flow of payments 
from customers to manufacturers.

5.  Enabling factors. These ensure the success of the  

overall approach.

In each part of the framework, we delve into the factors that 
OEMs should consider then discuss the emerging trends and 
innovations in the field. For more on the methodology that 
informed this framework, see sidebar, “About the research.”

At the same time, companies that lack a strategic vision for 
their aftermarket and service businesses often struggle to earn 
acceptable returns on the substantial up-front investments 
required. To lay a successful path for ROI in aftermarket and 
service, leading OEMs use their aftermarket offerings to 
expand while forging deeper relationships with customers and 
making their products work better—to achieve, for example, 
higher throughput, less consumption, and so forth. In part 2, we 
overview the trends executives are prioritizing in this effort or 
might consider if they have not yet done so. 

This white paper brings together the best of McKinsey’s 
published thinking on OEMs’ aftermarket and service, with 
a focus on B2B companies. Drawing on the latest and most 
relevant news and trends and brought to life with real examples, 
this report aims to be a catalyst for new, energizing ideas. It 
is intended for a broad audience, from CXOs to those curious 
about the sector and seeking an end-to-end view. 

About the research

The perspectives in this report are drawn 
from a structured assessment of critical 
business dimensions to analyze company 
performance along the entire aftermarket 

and service value chain. The research 
involved interviews with practitioners 
from across functions (such as quality, 
procurement, and sales).

Three decades ago, the typical aftermarket offering for 
manufacturers was an afterthought—it was reactive and 
transactional.1 The aftermarket was typically more of a simple 
response to customer queries, needs, or events, such as selling 
spare parts, conducting repairs, or providing training. While 
B2C manufacturers, particularly in the automotive industry, 
were early adopters of aftermarket and service strategies, B2B 
manufacturers have more recently recognized the immense 
potential and benefits of these offerings, especially in terms of 
generating stable and recuring revenue streams.

It was a gradual shift, but today B2B manufacturers are 
becoming true aftermarket partners with their customers—
for instance, signing contracts that guarantee operational 
performance. Some manufacturers are even willing to share 
risks with customers.2 McKinsey research has found that 
companies with a strong emphasis on becoming aftermarket 
providers and delivering exceptional service to their customers 
have achieved twice the TSR compared with their counterparts 
with a lower focus on service. 

The frontier of aftermarket and service innovation features 
robust use of modern technology such as advanced 
sensors, big data, and AI to offer predictive maintenance 
services, manufacturing consulting, and options for boosting 
productivity. For example, measurement sensors of physical 
parameters (such as vibrations or temperature) can be used 
to create comprehensive databases on mechanical systems’ 
state of health, helping predict failure and minimize downtime 
with predictive maintenance.

strategies,” McKinsey, March 2023.

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel In rail, a major rolling stock OEM leveraged its digitally-
enabled aftermarket service platform to reduce unscheduled 
maintenance while improving availability. As a result, 
maintenance costs decreased by 15 percent, an improvement 
in line with the McKinsey estimate of a potential 15 to 
25 percent efficiency gain in the rail sector through predictive 
maintenance. While this gain does not inherently have to 
accrue to OEMs, they are well placed to keep customers in their 
ecosystems by knowing the products best and offering OEM 
certifications. 

Technological developments have also made it possible to 
offer product features as a service. Some car manufacturers, 
for example, have developed aftermarket offerings in which 
they will—through remote activation, for a fee—increase 
vehicle performance, enable its self-driving capabilities, or sell 
additional features or subscriptions.

A useful framework for aftermarket companies divides the 
offering journey into five parts: innovation to market, market 
to order, order to delivery, and delivery to cash, all of which are 
supported by a set of commonsense enabling factors.

Part 1 of this report covers each of these stages in turn.

Innovation to market

During product development, an OEM should already have a 
clear understanding of the role that aftermarket and service 
will play for the product. This includes, crucially, deciding 
whether such service would be a source of profitability at all 
based on product particulars and current customers, plus 
a range of factors including geographical spread, customer 
expectations, required investment, and cost to service. Indeed, 
aftermarket and service should not be viewed as a mandatory 
strategy to be pursued regardless of circumstances but rather 
as an additional lever to generate revenue. 

For example, a manufacturer of highly durable coffeemakers 
chose not to offer aftermarket and service because its 
product’s value proposition centered on not requiring such 

10

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel support or spare parts throughout the product’s extended 
life span. Naturally, such durability is out of reach of many 
industrial companies, such aircraft, machinery, or car OEMs, 
for which aftermarket and service are an essential part of the 
customer experience. However, the durable coffeemaker’s 
experience is a reminder that a spectrum of approaches to 
aftermarket and service offerings should be carefully taken 
into consideration. 

Once the decision to move forward with aftermarket and 
service offerings is made, the innovation-to-market stage 
begins. Determining the right approach to aftermarket and 
service requires addressing a couple of critical factors: 
matching the aftermarket strategy to the product and tailoring 
services to customer needs. 

Matching the aftermarket strategy to the product 
Different products will require different aftermarket and 
service strategies to ensure each strategy matches customers’ 
needs and OEMs’ ambitions. For complex products and 
equipment such as jet engines, turbines, helicopters, and 
tractors, maintenance contracts can be a significant—or 
even the main—source of revenue. Properly structured, long-
term binding contracts can be mutually beneficial for both 
customers and OEMs: customers benefit from OEMs’ expertise 
in servicing their own products, which can lead to optimized 
maintenance costs and pricing models that are directly tied 
to the equipment’s utilization. OEMs are best placed to be a 
credible long-term aftermarket provider; no one understands 
these machines better than the original manufacturers.3  

Aeroengine manufacturers were pioneers in matching an 
aftermarket strategy to their original equipment by offering 
pay-for-use, subscription-like aftermarket care for their 
engines.4 Commercial aeroengines are regularly sold at

Senthil Muthiah, and Shane Rieniets, “The winning moves in project-based 
services,” McKinsey, February 6, 2020.

aerospace and defense players can win in aftermarket services,” McKinsey, 
September 21, 2022.

11

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel or below cost for new aircraft orders but with aftermarket 
maintenance and service contracts based on effective flying 
hours. This effectively turns capital expenditures into operating 
expenditures for OEMs and delivers steady and predictable 
revenues into the future. 

Such contracts can be combined with other strategies to 
defend competitive advantage—such as patented materials, 
complex parts, or other features that make a machine best 
serviceable by its original manufacturer and reduce the market 
share available to other OEMs and service-only companies. 
However, if product complexity is created solely for the 
purpose of locking in customers and is not born of genuine 
product-related requirements, this approach is not mutually 
beneficial. In such cases, customers might opt for different 
providers of new units to avoid being locked into a restrictive 
service model.

It is important not to assume that the goal of an OEM should 
always be to lock its customers into long-term service 
contracts and relationships. For example, a small- to medium-
size airplane manufacturer, primarily catering to tourists in 
remote areas of the world, has decided to use commercially 
available parts for all components requiring regular 
replacement. The use of widely available parts helps ensure 
the manufacturer’s aircraft can be easily and quickly repaired 
in remote areas, from Southeast Asia to the Caribbean, where 
the manufacturer could not provide adequate service on 
proprietary components. Of course, such an approach strongly 
limits aftermarket and service revenue, but in this case, it 
delivers a desirable customer experience. The alternative to 
this approach is waiting for a replacement part on location or 
for transportation of the aircraft to the closest OEM service 
station, meaning the customer might have to wait days or 
even weeks for an aircraft to re-enter service. This delay and 
complexity could affect customers’ willingness to buy new 
aircraft from the same OEM in the future.

Geographic footprint is an important strategic factor for OEMs 
considering aftermarket and service offerings. The business

case for opening warehouses and service stations all over 
the world may not be profitable unless there is a sufficient 
customer base present in the targeted geographies. The 
above OEM optimizes its geographic footprint by recognizing 
it cannot provide all necessary servicing in remote areas, 
instead building planes with commercially available parts for all 
maintenance-prone components. This ensures that its small 
planes could easily be repaired in remote areas, where demand 
for such planes creates strategically important markets.

Tailoring services to customer needs
Having a compelling aftermarket and service offering is a 
basic requirement of the overall strategy, with customers 
now requiring solutions tailored to their specific needs. As an 
example, 56 percent of aerospace and defense executives who 
responded to a McKinsey survey said their customers expect 
need-based solutions, and 66 percent said it was a critical 
element of a service offering (Exhibit 2).5 

Once company leaders articulate their aftermarket strategies, 
they can refine their aftermarket offerings to optimize the 
balance of profitability, market share, and market penetration. 
One useful approach is to segment parts and products 
according to their functional and technical characteristics— 
for instance, whether a part is essentially a commodity, widely 
available on the market from various suppliers (such as the 
mirrors for an automotive OEM), or hard to find and mission-
critical for customers (such as complex engine components for 
an automotive OEM). 

The strategic approach for each is, obviously, quite different. 
Focusing on commoditized parts will likely bring lower margins 
per unit due to higher competition, so OEMs can optimize 
these offerings by emphasizing high volume and operational 
efficiency to remain profitable while keeping prices competitive.

Another way to segment parts is to use supply and demand 
data of parts across products and customers, such as how 
often customers order a part or product, to determine which 
products warranted inclusion in the aftermarket and service 
strategy. These segmentation analyses can be complex and 
technical, but our experience suggests that the process tends 
to produce a manageable number of segments that help OEMs 
identify the right combination of offerings and terms. OEMs 
often already have the data on hand or can easily establish 
data collection to better understand trends. 

Finally, additional services can help convert parts of an OEM’s 
offering into an “as a service” (aaS) model—without having 
to completely revolutionize the product. Customers of aaS 
offerings do not need to ration products and services, and 
OEMs enjoy a more predictable stream of revenue and can 
plan capacity accordingly. Some industries, especially the ones 
dealing with low volumes and high-complexity products, still 

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel

lag behind other industries in this area for structural reasons—
including long product life cycles and cybersecurity-related 
constraints—and perceived risks. But aaS offerings can help 
companies create significant value and achieve incremental 
top-line growth of 10 to 25 percent while increasing customer 
loyalty and satisfaction.6 

As customers and their needs vary, OEMs must look beyond 
their own equipment and understand the customer’s end-to-
end experience. These additional customer insights can inform 
more comprehensive value-added services.7 

One automotive OEM expanded its maintenance and repair 
services by offering tailored insurance policies. The company 
calculated insurance premiums using existing driving analytics 
data, eliminating the need to install additional hardware to 
track key inputs. Although insurance services are traditionally 
outside the scope of OEMs, the innovative approach unlocked 
significant margins.

There are additional innovative examples across manufacturing 
and industrials. For example, an elevator OEM leveraged 
its maintenance expertise to service competitors’ products. 
Despite strict sector regulations that typically preclude such 
expanded services, the company established a dedicated 
reverse engineering division to gain the necessary product 
knowledge and roll it out to a large field workforce. This 
strategy enabled the company to realize economics of 
scale from servicing a higher number of systems, expand 
its customer base to customers not previously using their 
products, and ultimately expand cross-selling opportunities 
across OEM products and aftermarket services. Finally, 
this virtuous circle also allowed the company to improve its 
predictive-maintenance solution by collecting more data to 
train predictive models, enhancing their accuracy and thereby 
the overall customer experience.

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel An industrial battery-management company faced a similar 
situation. Its customers were facing high power-management 
costs stemming from large battery inventories and the 
numerous technicians needed for uninterrupted operations. 
The company implemented an Internet of Things platform 
enabling two-way communication between the cloud and local 
sites, providing identity management and insight into all the 
assets. This system allowed the company to understand the 
real operating conditions of its installed base and—through 
automated analyses—offer predictive diagnosis tailored to 
each asset and client, optimizing the battery lifetime and thus 
reducing power management costs.

Finally, an industrial-equipment OEM that wanted to enhance 
revenue from new warranty solutions introduced extended 
warranties on specific parts. Customers could subscribe to 
have covered parts replaced or repaired quickly, provided they 
purchased original spare parts from the OEM. This allowed 
the company to leverage its knowledge of the customer to 
forecast part repair and inventory needs while helping secure 
revenue and share of customer wallet. A crucial element of 
this approach was identifying the right parts to include in the 
subscription based on rate of failure and complexity of repair, 
selecting components that were least prone to failure but also 
the most complex and expensive to replace. Customers highly 
value this service because it protects them from major losses; 
meanwhile, it creates a strong lock-in on original parts at a low 
cost for OEMs.

Market to order 

The market-to-order phase spans the pre-offer period, from 
prospecting, business development, and scouting to when 
a client completes an order. OEMs have much to consider in 
this period, including estimating the commercial potential of 
aftermarket and service, setting up and using commercial 
nerve centers, and pricing aftermarket offerings. 

17

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel Assessing the commercial potential of aftermarket  
and service
Aftermarket spending is starting to account for a significant 
share of revenues and margins for some manufacturing 
companies, particularly manufacturers of large and complex 
products, such as aircraft engines, and construction 
equipment providers. These companies are using mature 
contract schemes to monetize their services. According to the 
McKinsey Service Benchmark,8 65 percent of revenue in the 
construction equipment industry comes from aftermarket and 
service, just ahead of aircraft engines and mining equipment 
(both 55 percent) and HVAC (50 percent). As more industrial 
companies recognize the potential of aftermarket and service, 
their leaders are carefully assessing the commercial potential.

In our experience, successful aftermarket and service offerings 
can increase service sales by up to 40 percent in some areas in 
just a few years. But even early movers in the industrial space 
have struggled to capture the full potential of their aftermarket 
and service businesses.9  

These difficulties can be partially attributed to the challenge 
of sizing the market and identifying relevant commercial 
opportunities for aftermarket and service. Indeed, only 
half the companies in our sample say they regularly do so. 
The challenge is not necessarily starting the process; it’s 
committing to the high level of rigor and discipline required and 
iterating it over time. Aftermarket and service sit in the shadow 
of new-unit sales, which tend to be higher profile and the focus 
of both executive and sales teams. Overcoming this hurdle 
requires changing mindsets and even cultures so aftermarket 
and service—and specifically, sizing that business—can 
become a high priority.

aftermarket services: Growing the core,” McKinsey, July 27, 2017.

18

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel In many companies, critical data and knowledge that could 
propel the success of aftermarket and service offerings or 
enhance existing ones are dispersed across various divisions 
and functions, making it challenging for companies to 
locate and tap into valuable expertise. Accurately assessing 
aftermarket and service, then, would likely require support 
from analytics and data management. 

Company leaders could consider three steps when sizing the 
market for aftermarket and service: 

1.  Create a reliable data set for the installed base (units 
currently in use). This effort may require collecting, 
cleaning, and consolidating information from multiple 
sources going back as far as decades.10 

2.  Understand customer maintenance cycles. Targeted 

interviews of salespeople, experts, and customers can 
shed light on various aspects of maintenance, such as 
reliability, efficiency, and overall satisfaction. 

3.  Match past service orders with the installed base, which 
will help build a comprehensive view of actual service 
penetration across the installed base.

Once these steps are complete, leaders could divide the 
market according to the most significant dimensions for their 
company—for example, by end user, product, or country. These 
insights could guide subsequent decisions about factors that 
help capture the market opportunity, such as sales targets.

Establishing commercial nerve centers 
A commercial nerve center—that is, an agile, coordinated body 
that brings together members from across business functions 
such as sales, marketing, and program management—can help 
companies achieve their strategic goals by bringing together 
the necessary data and knowledge to develop and execute key 
strategies. These commercial nerve centers can be dedicated 
to helping companies achieve their top-line goals in the 

10  For more on making the data as usable as possible, see “How aerospace and 

defense players can win,” September 21, 2022.

19

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel aftermarket, and effective commercial nerve centers can help 
build momentum in companies to catalyze action and deliver 
results quickly. 

Because aftermarket businesses are closely linked to 
equipment in the field, commercial nerve centers that focus 
on this area can benefit from gaining specialized knowledge 
of their customers’ operations, including how they manage 
their fleets.

Take the example of a leading equipment-solution OEM that 
sought to substantially boost its aftermarket and service sales 
by implementing a generative AI (gen AI) solution to clean sales 
and operations data, create a live aftermarket data lake, and 
generate leads. The company also used a virtual sales agent 
to automate personalized emails for its large customer base, 
increasing outreach capacity. The virtual agent could also help 
during the lead conversion process by recognizing customer 
intent and needs based on their responses to outreach, then 
passing those insights to the sales team. Additionally, the OEM 
provided comprehensive training for both inside and outside 
sales reps, focusing on proactive customer outreach and 
understanding customer needs in specific verticals. As a result 
of these initiatives, the company saw a 20 percent increase in 
generated leads, with a validation rate of more than 80 percent, 
indicating just how effective such an approach can be.

Another example comes from a defense-systems company 
that launched an 18-month effort to boost top-line growth in 
the aftermarket. It developed a digital solution to automatically 
generate opportunities and boost capability building to 
improve the effectiveness of its sales force. This training was 
essential because targets tied to new tools are often missed 
due to low adoption of those tools. The efforts paid off, with 
service orders increasing by 40 percent in one year and by 
300 percent in three years.

A principal enabler for these solutions is clean and reliable data. 
However, OEMs often contend with scattered and incoherent 
client data sources, and this problem only gets worse when 
OEMs grow through multiple acquisitions, since databases are 

20

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel often not uniform. Until a few years ago, organizing, cleaning, 
and integrating this data was an extremely time-consuming 
process that could take months or even years. But, today, 
service intelligence platforms have greatly simplified this 
practice by helping companies clean and integrate data from 
enterprise resource management and customer relationship 
management systems, and even external public documents 
such as environmental, social, and governance targets. The 
market is clearly moving in this direction, and many different 
platforms are already commercially available.

Pricing
There are a number of different parameters that companies can 
consider when determining potential pricing for aftermarket 
and service: the value of rapid delivery (particularly for 
proprietary, high-value, or specific parts or services); the value 
of OEMs’ services; and the value of best-in-class, responsive 
customer support. Pricing options available to companies also 
vary and include (but are not limited to) the following:

Value-based pricing. In this model, pricing is correlated to 
the value delivered. This may look like tiered pricing based 
on service level, use, or outcome. Segmenting and defining 
parts or customers up front can help leaders determine the 
appropriate combination of prices and terms. For example, 
complementary parts of a machine would need to be priced 
similarly, even if demand for the parts may not be identical. 
In some cases, parts that may not be inherently expensive 
because of their materials or complexity can have an outsize 
effect on the overall value to the customer, especially if the 
parts are critical to ensuring the availability of machines and 
meeting regulatory requirements. 

Bundling and upselling. Companies could analyze historical 
data to discover what parts are often purchased together; 
they could then sell those parts in a single bundle. Meanwhile, 
upselling and cross-selling can help companies maximize 
revenues while also streamlining their operations by 
making production planning and inventory management 

21

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel more predictable and further ensuring competitive service 
to customers.

Dynamic pricing. This generally involves applying analytics 
and market insights to determine the price in nearly real time, 
using parameters such as current demand, competition, and 
customer behavior. The analysis should balance profitability 
and market share.

Another important factor to consider is the customer discount 
policy. For example, a helicopter OEM used to give discounts 
on standard aftermarket prices to more than 80 percent 
of its service centers and customers. While this approach 
contributed to high aftermarket revenue, it also led to lower 
profitability than expected. To address the issue, the helicopter 
OEM adjusted the discount strategy based on factors such 
as numbers of units sold for service centers and fleet size for 
customers. As a result, top service centers and customers 
continued to benefit from better pricing while others no longer 
negatively affected the OEM’s profitability.

Regardless of the pricing and discount approach, company 
leaders should ensure that prices satisfy customer 
preferences, are appropriate for the competitive landscape, 
create the right profit margins, and fit within a coherent  
pricing architecture.

Order to delivery

The majority of modern industrials companies purchase 
aftermarket products from a complex global supply chain. 
Meanwhile, OEMs maintain design and engineering authority 
over the products that are sold. Consequently, the procurement 
processes of these products are of fundamental importance to 
both OEMs and customers. The order-to-delivery phase starts 
with comprehensive planning, encompasses manufacturing 
and procurement considerations, and concludes with seamless 
product and service delivery. 

22

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel Sourcing management 
When developing a winning sourcing strategy, company 
executives and leadership should consider an overarching 
procurement strategy as well as specific elements and tactics 
that enhance value. We have identified two critical steps to this 
process. The first is articulating the sourcing strategy, such 
as deciding the target length of agreements and whether to 
use requests for proposals (RFPs), auctions, or spot buys. 
The second step is identifying ways to use cost and quality to 
maximize value. For example, company leaders might outline 
the optimal number of respondents to engage in the RFP 
process to optimize competition between suppliers or decide in 
advance how transparent to be in supplier negotiations.

When it comes to implementing the sourcing strategy, five 
questions are particularly influential in the execution:

1.  How critical is the supplier to the OEM’s business?

2.  What type of sourcing event (for example, RFPs, auctions, 

market buys, and so on) is preferred, and what are 
the criteria?11  

3.  What is the scope of sourcing? For example, is it an entire 

category of materials or multiple subcategories? 

4.  What’s the duration of the procurement agreement? 

5.  How and to what extent should the firm use intermediaries, 
such as fully outsourced procurement services, value-
added partnerships for specialized services, or fully 
in-house procurement?

Using analytics throughout the process can optimize costs, 
service quality, and lead time. However, our experience 
suggests that many companies are underusing the valuable 
tools available to them, such as should-cost and cleansheet

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel analyses.12 This is particularly true for spare parts compared 
with new units; spare parts often cost much less, but even 
the cheapest items can represent a significant opportunity 
when considering the high volumes typically associated with 
aftermarket and service operations.

Manufacturing 
In the aftermarket, many parts, products, and services are 
time-sensitive, with customers often eagerly awaiting delivery—
making short lead times crucial. Despite the fact that shorter 
lead times also mean converting orders into cash flows more 
quickly, long lead times remain a common challenge (Exhibit 3). 
A recent McKinsey survey found that the top challenge faced 
by aerospace and defense companies is securing operations 
and competitive lead times.

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel with measuring cycle times to understand operational 
efficiency. Cycle times are derived from analysis and shop 
floor observations; they are critical inputs to overall equipment 
efficiency (OEE) and overall process efficiency (OPE), both of 
which provide valuable insights into the performance of each 
machine and workstation. 

The best way to reduce lead times is to compress the duration 
of the entire sequence of events, from the receipt of a service 
request or parts to the service completion or when the parts 
are packed and shipped. In our experience, companies that 
adopt a comprehensive set of solutions showed an overall 
reduction in lead times up to 30 to 40 percent compared with 
companies that only focused on one step of the value chain 
(Exhibit 4).

Advanced digital tools can, of course, be crucial to the overall 
process. Consider quality assurance and packing, the final 
stage of the order-to-delivery process: remote quality checks, 
virtual reality, digital inventory, and 3D printing for spare

incomplete or inaccurate, OEE would need to be recalibrated. 
A suite of sensors could help estimate OEE using equipment 
available time, service or production volume, and observed 
cycle times. The results can help company leaders identify the 
most important opportunities to reduce cycle time.

Stakeholders could remove bottlenecks from production lines 
quickly and efficiently by redistributing the workload. They 
could rebalance tasks among resources, an approach that’s 
particularly effective for tasks performed by operators. The 
process can be meticulously modeled using spreadsheet tools, 
with resource allocation adjusted accordingly. Iterative testing 
on production lines, whenever possible, further refines the 
rebalancing process, optimizing both cycle times and OEE and 
OPE levels.

To achieve future-state objectives, cycle time reductions 
necessitate an examination of current-state observations 
and the potential elimination of tasks within each cycle—or at 
least a reduction in their duration. Concurrently, OEE and OPE 
enhancements are pursued through a comprehensive waterfall 
analysis aimed at reducing losses.

Operator workloads are a focal point in optimization efforts, 
and in response to changing production demands, careful 
rebalancing becomes imperative. For example, consider a 
scenario in which an OEM is transitioning from a seven-day to a 
five-day operation in one area and from five days to two days in 
another area: operator workloads, especially for the operators 
of those two areas, will intensify. This necessitates a strategic 
redistribution of tasks—notably, the transfer of activities such 
as pallet handling and manual transport to a third operator—
facilitating the achievement of takt time and operational goals.

These key points are supported by lessons from the consumer 
goods and retail sectors, which have long been chasing 
faster cycle times from customer order to delivery. Although 
the products may differ, the strategies that have made retail 
successful can be applied to the aftermarket, including 
understanding where speed matters the most to customers 

26

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel and planning accordingly, selectively investing in capacity and 
networks to reduce bottlenecks, and embracing real-time data 
analytics and automation to increase overall productivity.

Supply chain and inventory management 
The most important, formative aftermarket and service 
supply chain decisions—from the footprint of the distribution 
network to sales channel strategies—vary significantly by 
business model, regulatory environment, and other factors. For 
example, in some cases, the distribution network is mandatory, 
with entities even purchasing spare parts and portfolios of 
initiatives to resell to customers. In other scenarios, the OEM 
directly handles sales, while intermediaries may only serve as 
maintainers or assemblers of parts. It is essential to recognize 
that depending on what the business model and sold products 
are, dynamics can differ greatly, and while there are key 
concepts to manage, companies should avoid generalizing. 

Optimized networks—designed for each company’s unique 
situation—could balance requirements such as cost and fill 
rates. Similarly, while the optimal inventory levels for service 
parts at each stocking location will vary, having them can 
help minimize the lag between a customer’s order and when 
equipment is restored to normal working order.

Consider the number of SKUs in the inventory. New-product 
supply chains typically involve a known number of SKUs 
with known start- and end-of-life cycles. By contrast, the 
aftermarket involves many varied field-replaceable units with 
intricate relationships, which results in more heterogeneity  
and unpredictability.

This aspect is especially critical in sectors such as automotive, 
where the number of SKUs can reach the hundreds of 
thousands. For example, an automotive OEM was facing 
frequent part shortages because of reactive spare parts 
inventory management, which led to long delays and a 
deteriorating customer experience. Even with limited capital 
expenditures, it was possible for the OEM to implement new AI 
algorithms on its legacy IT systems to precisely estimate the 
demand of each SKU. This allowed the OEM to not only reduce 

27

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel shortages by 50 percent but also keep a very lean spare parts 
inventory, increasing it by just 5 percent.

Distribution networks also differ significantly. New-product 
supply chains have multiple distribution paths, encompassing 
direct sales, distributors, and resellers. These distribution paths 
provide redundancy and are unidirectional, focused on outbound 
logistics. Meanwhile, the aftermarket tends to operate with a 
single delivery network that must respond to unpredictable 
demand and provide inbound and outbound logistics.

When it comes to inventory management, the focus for new 
products is on maximizing inventory turns. For the aftermarket, 
the focus is on maximizing fill rates so equipment in the field 
can return to regular functioning.

Obsolescence and the two-speed challenge 
Producers of complex machinery, such as manufacturers 
of heavy equipment, encounter a frequent time horizon 
dilemma.13 The products they develop typically have a life span 
of 30 years or more, requiring ongoing support—including low-
volume legacy parts and technical expertise—throughout the 
product’s life. However, some of the component parts of these 
systems, especially newer products such as semiconductors, 
electronic boards, and mechanical elements, may have much 
shorter life spans, lasting only a fraction of the time compared 
with the overall system. 

This “two speed” challenge can lead to difficulties in sourcing 
components over time and may result in their obsolescence 
as suppliers grapple with raw-material shortages or cease 
production altogether. Consequently, many OEMs devise 
substitutes for these outdated components, taking on 
nonrecurring engineering costs that escalate with the 
quickening pace of technological cycles and the growing 
interconnection of supply chains.

13  “How industrial and aerospace and defense OEMs can win the obsolescence 

challenge,” McKinsey, April 14, 2022.

28

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel The two-speed challenge puts additional loads on 
multiple functions: 

 — Operations. OEMs have to redesign systems around new 
components to replace obsolete ones. The effort often 
requires building out an entirely new supply chain in a 
relatively short period of time.

 — Inventory management. Any product redesign from 

obsolescence creates a cascading effect in inventory 
management. Many components in the inventory for the 
equipment will not be compatible with the redesigned 
product and will be turned into scrap.

 — Commercial function, such as sales and marketing. The 

new, often one-time costs of designing a new component 
are often passed on to end customers by necessity, which 
makes for a less affordable and less competitive product. 

 — Service. A discontinued component will no longer be 
available as a spare part. This increases the cost and 
complexity of delivery and reduces customer satisfaction. 

A proactive, methodical approach can help OEMs address this 
hard-to-avoid challenge. OEMs can take three critical steps to 
minimize one-time engineering costs for obsolescence: 

1. 

Identify additional, alternate suppliers for any components 
that are ready for installation without a redesign. OEMs, 
distributors, and brokers can help identify and procure the 
right components. 

2. 

Identify alternatives to obsolete components that can be 
modified at minimal cost, avoiding a redesign. 

3.  As a last resort, redesign the component to minimize costs 
and disruptions to the design of the product or system.

Anticipating components’ obsolescence can forestall 
equipment-level or system-level problems. One good 
strategy is to continually scan for problems that could come 
from obsolescence. Resources—specifically, funding and 

29

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel processes—dedicated to strategic purposes of at-risk 
components can help. 

Tools dedicated to consolidating OEMs’ in-house intelligence 
with market data can create a window into obsolete or at-risk 
components. These tools can also provide information on 
alternate suppliers, alternate components that could be similar 
enough in form, fit, and function, and the costs associated 
with them. To make full use of these tools, roles dedicated 
to obsolescence can ensure that OEMs have champions of 
obsolescence-related considerations and a team that’s ready 
to work with suppliers to refine the supply chain to counter the 
relevant challenges.

There are also alternative options for OEMs to ensure 
continued availability for the long tail of product usage. In 
aerospace, some original-design OEMs sell the license to 
their legacy parts to trusted specialist partners to continue 
manufacturing OEM-specific parts and providing maintenance, 
repair, and overhaul (MRO) services. This approach allows for 
support throughout the life cycle of platforms and parts that 
could otherwise be a lower priority for original-design OEMs 
and lead to poor customer experiences. This model offers 
benefits to both clients, who gain a focused OEM-licensed 
partner to deliver legacy parts and service quickly, and 
OEMs, which can monetize legacy parts through the licensing 
agreements and gain residual cash flows while ensuring 
continued customer support.

Finally, OEMs should consider obsolescence at the  
beginning and factor component obsolescence into the  
R&D process. This effort will require cooperation between 
multiple stakeholders, such as engineering functions and 
suppliers. Stakeholders would also likely need to standardize 
interfaces and modular designs and minimize the use of 
specialized components.14

OEMs can win the obsolescence challenge,” April 14, 2022.

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel Field workforce 
The field workforce has traditionally been at the center of the 
service and aftermarket sector, especially in relation to break-
fix activities. Even as some activities shift to remote services, 
the field service will continue to play a vital role. By evolving 
their field operations, OEMs can improve service levels, 
customer experience, efficiency, and productivity, ultimately 
creating value for customers and potentially transforming their 
field workforces into an additional sales force. 

OEMs can take several approaches to improve field workforce 
performance and services, with the most common involving 
performance management and process standardization in 
the form of standard operating procedures (SOPs). However, 
SOPs are only effective if correctly applied and if technicians 
implement process-based workflows. In this regard, 
companies can enhance their service quality and procedure 
adoption in various ways, including creating clear progression 
paths toward better positions, instituting internal certifications 
for skill development, and establishing transparent selection 
criteria and incentives for employees. Linking progression to 
compliance with SOPs, for example, can engage field operators 
and improve service repeatability.

In addition to traditional levers, digital tools and analytics 
can strongly improve the productivity and quality of the field 
workforce. For example, a medtech OEM experiencing low 
performance and margins in its service business, mainly 
because of limited use of digital and analytics, increased its 
service engineer utilization to 75 percent, from 55 percent, 
in less than a year. The OEM achieved this by focusing its AI 
efforts on aligning field technicians to customer demand with 
a three-step approach: creating geographic clusters based on 
historical demand; calculating headcount, including both work 
hours and travel time; and allocating resources to properly 
deploy technicians and also minimize travel time. After the 
initial signs of success of this first AI-enabled business case, 
the medtech OEM rolled out a full-fledged analytics program, 
including spare parts inventory, remote resolution, and 
advanced troubleshooting.

31

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel The telecommunications sector offers another relevant case 
study. One telco used to reactively perform installations, 
maintenance, construction, and back-office work through 
manual work planning, but it has since transitioned to a new 
operating model. This model includes task intelligence–
focused dashboards to enhance productivity and engagement, 
AI coaches to help supervisors improve workforce efficiency, 
and AI-powered analytics for forecasting and scheduling 
maintenance operations, considering both long-term 
capacity planning and short-term work planning. These 
operational process optimizations have resulted in significant 
improvements, including a 15 percent increase in capacity, a 
30 percent reduction in required workforce, and a 10 percent 
increase in workforce utilization. 

OEMs can achieve further optimization by leveraging gen 
AI, as in the case of a European machinery distributor that 
implemented a comprehensive solution to drastically reduce 
unplanned downtime and customer costs. The solution 
consists of two main blocks: a platform that integrates all 
service-related information and a module for a language 
learning model (gen AI). The platform serves as a centralized 
hub where technicians can access manuals, procedures, and 
guidelines, streamlining the troubleshooting process. AI 
chatbots, or “copilots,” act as conversational orchestrators 
of the service, providing live collaboration through insights, 
recommendations, root cause analyses, reports, and 
documents. The implementation of this solution resulted in a 
10 percent increase in first-time-right resolutions, significant 
cost savings for clients, faster problem identification, and 
improved accessibility and efficiency for technicians.

Last, field workforces and technicians can become a powerful 
extension of the sales team. By being in close proximity to 
clients and interacting with them and their products on-site, 
the field workforce is uniquely positioned to identify client 
needs, solve existing issues, and prevent future issues. Given 

32

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel the right tools, they can build stronger and more profitable 
relationships with clients, adding value to the organization.15 

Delivery to cash

The delivery-to-cash phase, the final segment of the journey 
for aftermarket and service, is primarily focused on the 
importance of cash management. Many industrial companies 
operate with around 90 days of outstanding receivables in 
terms of cash. While chasing receivables is often not the top 
priority of a company, reduced cash flows from nonpayment  
of receivables can nevertheless cause significant issues if  
not addressed.

There are two priority delivery-to-cash activities that OEMs 
should consider: structural interventions that can help avoid or 
at least minimize past-due credits and the processes through 
which past-due credits are collected. Addressing receivables 
can be complicated and span the finance, commercial, and 
sales organizations, given the complex contractual terms and 
conditions often facing industrial companies. This includes 
complex processes that involve multiple intermediaries, 
bespoke contracts, and a significant number of invoices over  
a long duration. 

The most important actions to optimize the cash collection 
process in aftermarket and service for industrial companies 
include the following:

 — defining target terms and conditions to be used in  

contract negotiations

 — implementing comprehensive and simplified checklists to 

facilitate credit collection

 — developing training programs (including digital tools) and 

updating employee incentive schemes to increase focus on 
cash collection

“Industrial services’ overlooked sales force: Their technicians,” McKinsey,  
May 18, 2021.

33

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel These interventions are more relevant for aftermarket and 
service businesses compared with selling new units because 
of the higher volume of invoices and lower average transaction 
value in aftermarket and service, especially for spare parts. 
The complexity is further increased when intermediaries, such 
as spare parts distributors, are involved, which is a common 
situation in manufacturing industries.

No single solution can effectively streamline the delivery-to-
cash process, but companies could understand the specific 
factors behind their organizations’ long delivery-to-cash times. 
These factors could include unfulfilled deliveries to customers’ 
practices, incomplete documentation, and more (Exhibit 5).

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel After assessing the factors behind their delivery-to-cash 
performance in detail, companies could identify the best ways 
to speed up cash flow and free up working capital. 

One solution is to launch credit collection campaigns, 
which can effectively reduce past-due credits as long as 
stakeholders systematically track past-due credits and their 
causes. The resulting insights could help mitigate future delays.

Enabling factors

To achieve service excellence, organizations need the right 
structures, performance management systems, and digital 
capabilities—all aligned to their strategies and business needs. 

The organization
As with any business, optimizing the aftermarket and service 
business requires the right talent and the right organizational 
structure. In fact, across industrial companies, several common 
but suboptimal practices can lead to revenue losses of up to 
10 percent, such as the following:

 — viewing services as cost centers rather than full-fledged 

business opportunities

 — maintaining siloed processes for design and service, with 

products and services treated as separate entities

 — allowing disjointed service sales and delivery departments, 
causing the sales team to overlook possible leads from 
field-based technical insights

 — enabling excessive decentralization of delivery, leading 
to higher costs because of unnecessary geographical 
redundancy of functions.

Due to the impact of organization on the performance of 
aftermarket and service businesses, company leaders would 
need to clarify their stance on two things: level of integration 
and service function centralization. 

Level of integration. The first conclusion leaders should come 
to is how integrated the aftermarket organization should be 

35

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel with the core business—that is, the aftermarket division’s 
structure and how it relates to the rest of the company, the 
degree of influence it has, and how to set up the aftermarket 
division to minimize redundancies. There are three archetypes 
currently in use among aftermarket and service companies: 
fully integrated, hybrid, and separated unit (Exhibit 6). Each has 
distinct benefits and risks:

 — In the fully integrated model, sales and services are 

integrated within the product business units. This 
organization structure offers businesses a holistic view of 
their products and services, enabling better planning and 
optimization. It also facilitates faster decision making and 
closer alignment with customer needs, leading to improved 
satisfaction and competitiveness. However, leaders 
must navigate the risks, including a lack of accountability 
for services versus products, challenges with divergent 
methodologies and technologies, and missed synergies 
between business units.

 — The hybrid model features a separate services business 
unit that assumes full ownership of service delivery while 
influencing services sales through a center of excellence. 
This approach has several benefits, including scalability, 
consistency across methodologies and technology, and 
maintained sales proximity to the market. Risks include 
reduced flexibility in addressing specific business-unit 
needs, potential organizational inconsistencies that slow 
down decision making and time to market, and the need for 
additional processes to ensure coordination.

 — In the traditional separated-unit structure, a distinct 

services business unit maintains full ownership of its own 
profit and loss. This model provides organizational focus 
and scale, increased efficiency, fair pricing for services, and 
professionalized product development, making it particularly 
suitable for services with multiple business units. Risks include 
losing sight of the full project life cycle, diffusing accountability, 
creating duplications, and making it harder to align the sales 
business unit’s goals with those of the service business unit.

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel services to multiple locations or business units. This approach 
offers several advantages, such as economies of scale; 
standardization; specialized talent; cross-fertilization of data, 
knowledge, and expertise; and more-effective prioritization of 
resources. It may also result in a lack of proximity to business 
units and a shortage of region-specific offerings.

A regional model, in contrast, involves situating service 
functions in specific regions or countries, offering local 
expertise, flexibility, proximity to business units, and regional 
capacity. However, the regional model may face challenges 
with standardization, leading to fragmentation and duplication 
of efforts. 

An organization’s choice between the centralized or regional 
model depends on various factors, including product regional 
differentiation, the distribution of the customer base, the 
average size of client companies, production’s business unit 
footprint, and regulatory differences within the company’s 
footprint. (Exhibit 8).

A notable example is the supply chain, in which companies can 
take on a number of different forms. To determine the right 
structure, leaders could consider the scope of the aftermarket 
supply chain, how difficult it would be to centralize the supply 
chain management function, and the most appropriate kind of 
supply chain for the company. For instance, a global company 
that works with complex parts for machinery may lean toward a 
decentralized structure to better manage regional variations in 
demand and to have a buffer against supply chain disruptions. 
On the other hand, a company with a smaller geographic 
footprint and simpler products might find a centralized 
structure more efficient and easier to manage.

 Other measures to increase working capital could include 
negotiating and enforcing more-stringent payment terms, 
offering incentives aimed at pushing credit collection, and 
providing employee training for best practices for monitoring 
and managing past-due credits.

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel Performance-management systems
Many aftermarket organizations have distributed structures 
and many layers. This means company leaders would need to 
put in continuous effort to communicate and ensure that the 
entire aftermarket organization understands its performance 
management system. 

For instance, aftermarket and service businesses’ productivity 
and cost efficiency could be measured through KPIs such 
as the number of panels produced per work week per full-
time employee. Deviations from benchmarks and the ratio of 
used hours to sold hours (such as time spent repairing a part 
compared to the time sold to a customer to complete that 
repair) can be helpful measures of efficiency. In some cases, 
the effectiveness of quality and service delivery might be 
measured by the number of service cases per 100 installations, 
shedding light on the efficacy of service delivery. Safety might 
be measured by the number of site visits or the time elapsed 
since the last recorded accident, customer satisfaction 
measured with a customer satisfaction score, and employee 
engagement and organizational health measured by scoring 
workforce pulse surveys.

Digital tools and capabilities
Digital tools have been unlocking value for industrial 
companies for the past few decades and have done so more 
recently in service and aftermarket. AI, particularly gen AI, has 
the potential to reinvent how services are delivered, with a 
number of use cases emerging in recent years (for examples, 
see Exhibit 9).

Industrial companies can apply these use cases across all 
steps of the service and aftermarket excellence journey, with 
the following examples being some of the most impactful:

 — Innovation to market. Companies can implement digital 
twins to reduce development lead time and can reduce 
physical testing time in favor of virtual simulations (for 
example, replicating years of deterioration of a spare part  
in minutes).

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel While the benefits may be obvious, deploying, using, and 
harnessing digital tools can be challenging. Many industrial 
companies are struggling across the board—for example, in 
areas such as data preparation, cleaning, and warehousing—
and many lack the required internal capabilities and expertise 
to deliver effective digital capabilities, such as cybersecurity 
and software development. In a McKinsey survey for industrial 
companies conducted in 2022, respondents revealed that their 
most pressing concern involved identifying the right software 
partners within the ever-growing landscape of established 
businesses and new, more agile start-ups.16 Because the 
importance of digital capabilities will continue to grow, this 
area will likely require even more attention in the future.

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel 

In an era dominated by technological innovation, tech and 
tech-adopting companies have emerged as trendsetters 
and reshaped the landscape of services across industries, 
from manufacturing to consumer goods. Harnessing and 
implementing new digital tools can help to grow revenues by 
30 percent.17  

The pioneers’ experience offers ten pivotal lessons, illuminating 
how those companies are forging a new paradigm for the future 
of service industries:

1.  Offering a B2C-like customer experience. This includes 
expanding the product portfolio to encompass postsale 
products and services that are useful and offer easy-to-use 
experiences.

2.  Exploring “servitization.” This entails offering products  
as services, including through ongoing, performance-
based contracts.

3.  Collecting, analyzing, and monetizing data. For example, 

companies can leverage data to drive predictive 
maintenance regimes and offerings. 

4.  Pursuing “softwarization of features.” This involves 

improving product performance though a state-of-the-art 
service offering.

5.  Accessing new value pools through sustainability. This  
is increasingly a requirement from both customers  
and regulators.

6.  Expanding on higher-than-expected maturity in 

“remotization.” Companies can leverage in the new normal 
the remotization maturity developed during the pandemic.

7.  Leaning into the localization paradigm. This ensures a 
consistent delivery model everywhere and resilience to 
supply chains disruption.

are redefining the standard in terms of on-time delivery  
of quality products and can also be considered in a  
B2B context.

9.  Building ecosystems around products. Through 
ecosystems, users can fulfill a variety of needs.

10.  Handling disruptions to the service workforce. Disruptions 

push organizations to rethink their talent strategies.

Offering a B2C-like customer experience

There is a fundamental paradigm shift under way in aftermarket 
and service, characterized by the imperative to replicate 
the personalized experiences typically associated with B2C 
interactions. This sectorwide transformation has required 
companies to recalibrate their focus and allocate time and 
resources to providing more postsale products and services 
such as maintenance, accessories, product upgrades, and 
training. These services, like those commonly available 
and expected in the B2C spheres, are already helping B2B 
businesses maintain and enhance their product portfolios 
while providing customers with more-satisfying experiences.

A 2023 McKinsey survey of B2B companies across sectors 
and geographies identified the implementation of the 
personalization (and hyperpersonalization) of marketing, 
sales, and products, akin to B2C experiences, as a primary 
differentiating feature for winning companies. More than half of 
companies involved in the survey that saw their market share 
grow by more than 10 percent had invested in tools, customer 
journeys, and products to deliver B2C-like personalized 
experiences for their B2B customers.18  

For example, some leaders now offer specialized maintenance, 
cleaning, and restoration services, accompanied by bundled 
accessory offerings. Additional services, such as product 
engraving and customization, elevate the customer experience. 

18  “The multiplier effect: How B2B winners grow,” McKinsey, April 13, 2023.

48

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel Training sessions, both in person and virtual, empower 
customers to understand their product’s full potential. And the 
introduction of upgrade options and vintage product trade-ins 
reinforces the commitment to long-term customer satisfaction 
and retention.

These initiatives can also help improve internal processes. 
A leading heavy-equipment OEM, for example, developed 
dedicated digital apps to streamline communication with 
dealers (such as communications regarding virtual showrooms, 
financial quotes, and the resale of used items), resulting in an 
up to 80 percent reduction in order deviations. This saved the 
company time and money in complaint handling.

Exploring ‘servitization’

Servitization enables companies to convert the one-off sale 
of products into recurring sales or subscriptions to better 
utilize those products, such as the leasing of machines, critical 
components, tools, or traditional services. Put another way, 
servitization is providing access to capital-intensive products 
for an agreed period of time. This transition offers profound 
value for businesses that goes beyond the typical aftermarket 
propositions of simply selling spare parts or basic servicing.

The provision of products as a service helps players expand 
their scope along the value chain and life cycle. One of the 
most prominent examples is the transformation of Rolls-Royce 
from selling aeroengines to selling pay-by-the-hour contracts 
for engine operations. While servitization is a relatively 
straightforward concept, it can take on many different forms 
based on capabilities, products, and customer needs. 

Servitization has enabled players to broaden their reach into 
previously untapped customer segments, particularly those 
that have a temporary need for the product or a shortage of 
resources to afford the full capital investment. Products sold 
as a service are generally bundled with additional features and 
services. For example, a subscription-based rental of heavy 
machinery often includes periodic maintenance, installation, 
and upgrades and can transform costly capital expenditures 

49

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel The rise of servitization 
underscores the 
importance of a 
customer-centric 
approach to the 
aftermarket.

50

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel into operating expenditures financeable through cash 
flows rather than debt. Remote monitoring and predictive-
maintenance service offerings also benefit OEMs—through 
predictable future cash flows and data that can be leveraged 
in R&D—and customers, who can devolve maintenance 
responsibilities to another organization with an expert 
maintenance workforce without having to manage one directly.

Indeed, the rise of this model underscores the importance of 
a customer-centric approach to the aftermarket. Shaping the 
appropriate product-as-a-service and commercial structure 
requires a strong understanding of customers’ needs and 
purchasing behaviors; otherwise, there is a risk of losing rather 
than gaining competitive advantage.

Furthermore, servitization offers the potential for a more stable 
and recurring revenue stream, shifting from one-time product 
sales to ongoing service contracts. End-of-quarter fire sales 
could then fade in intensity, smoothing cash flow and allowing 
for adjustments in pricing or pausing payments—flexibility 
that can create added value for customers. An IFS survey 
across the industrials sector found that manufacturers that 
offer planned maintenance and service contracts were mostly 
likely to have profitable aftermarket services, with 62 percent 
reporting profitable service businesses.19  

One leading industrial equipment manufacturer began offering 
hardware-as-a-service, when traditionally it had been sold 
as a product. This European OEM develops, installs, and 
operates compressor systems at customer sites, providing 
maintenance and repairs bundled for a fixed fee. With ultimate 
control of compressors in the hands of the company instead 
of customers, faults decreased, improving security, and costs 
decreased thanks to better predictive maintenance.

In general, many companies in many industries could benefit 
from embracing servitization. Recently, B2B companies that 
needed to automate their operations but were hesitant about

51

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel the investment opted for subscription models for autonomous 
robots in warehousing, mobile picking, delivery, and logistics. 
This commercial model gave these companies the flexibility 
they needed to adjust to changes in demand, reduce upfront 
costs, and stabilize ongoing costs thanks to the periodic 
subscription plan.

As industrial companies expand into servitization, some have 
introduced advanced contract schemes, such as performance-
based service contracts (the exact KPIs of which may differ  
but often relate to availability). About half of respondents to  
the McKinsey A&D Service Survey 2022 consider these 
contracts to be critical elements of a compelling offering.20 
Done right, these contracts can foster better equipment and 
platform performance at lower and more predictable costs for 
end users while enabling companies to achieve higher margins, 
sign longer contracts, and improve their knowledge of end 
users’ needs.

However, there are many challenges in the servitization 
journey, including risk aversion, incomplete service solutions, 
suboptimal risk and contract management, underpricing, 
outdated commercial engines, and internal alignment issues. 
Addressing these hurdles will be pivotal as organizations 
navigate their unique path forward using all the potential 
commercial models at their disposal.

Collecting, analyzing, and monetizing data

Data collection, analysis, and monetization have proven 
transformative to the services sector and are likely to remain 
a crucial pillar of future successes across the industry. 
Predictive maintenance exemplifies the potential of data-
driven strategies. For instance, using AI to predict failures and 
minimize downtime in electrical systems, such as ball mills, 
is becoming increasingly commonplace for new sales and 
installed additions to legacy equipment. This process involves 
several important steps, including analysis to identify failure 

20 “How aerospace and defense players can win,” September 21, 2022.

52

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel probabilities, the evaluation of sensors to pinpoint those with 
the highest correlation to time to failure, and the establishment 
of a predictive model using algorithms such as heat maps and 
power variance.

A tier-one aerospace supplier providing aftermarket 
components and MRO services for aircraft employed an 
AI model to project ten years of repair events creating 
aftermarket MRO demand. This model allowed the supplier to 
tap into uncaptured MRO revenues and build accurate long-
term plans that reduced time spent on nonpriority components.

Another prominent industrial manufacturer has taken the 
technologies, tools, and learnings from using predictive 
maintenance to increase the uptime of its own advanced 
manufacturing production lines and created a new business 
offering for other manufacturers. It now offers sensors and 
a cloud-based analytics platform to develop predictive-
maintenance regimes for third parties, with pricing based on 
the value of increased production uptime. 

Predictive maintenance is one of many applications of AI that 
can cut costs in not only services but also operations. In many 
areas—including manufacturing, distribution, and inventory 
management—data-enabled operations optimization can 
enhance service performance at every step of the supply 
chain. Such optimization entails supply chain transparency for 
superior planning, improved forecast accuracy drawn from 
existing data, and streamlined field-service input costs through 
analytics-driven staffing and scheduling solutions aligned with 
real demand.21 

‘Softwarization’ of features

Just as servitization involves the transition of products into 
services, “softwarization” refers to the transformation of 
technology that is traditionally associated with hardware and

Adam Krych, Orlando Ramirez Cardenas, and Sanchit Tiwari, “Establishing the 
right analytics-based maintenance strategy,” McKinsey, July 19, 2021.

53

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel physical infrastructure into software-based solutions. This 
concept can offer significant benefits, including flexibility, 
scalability, and cost-efficiency. 

Car manufacturers, for example, are investing heavily 
in the transition from a focus on mechanical features to 
differentiating electronic features. Not only has this helped to 
reduce costs overall, but it has also been driven by customer 
sentiment, with more than 80 percent of customers willing 
to pay for mobile services. This transition has ranged from 
replacing traditional physical buttons for user functions with 
a touchscreen to some OEMs exploring pilots of autonomous 
vehicles. In the service arena, this shift has resulted in an 
evolution of the skills needed to maintain cars, such as 
interrogating analytics rather than disassembling an engine, 
as well as the use of software rather than hardware updates or 
physical replacements to fix faults. 

Tesla has been a pioneer in this area, using softwarization 
as a strategic tool to retain clients and expand postsales 
revenues. Tesla’s value proposition revolves around electronic 
features that enhance the customer experience, differentiating 
the company from competitors. The much-discussed 
Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, exemplifies 
this differentiation. All cars from 2019 are designed, from a 
hardware perspective, to include the autonomous-driving 
options. Customers can decide to purchase a car without any 
self-driving option installed initially and then later install the 
required software through their personal Tesla account. 

Sustainability as a key to unlock new  
value pools

Sustainability has emerged as a pivotal key to unlocking new 
value pools, ushering in innovative approaches and practices. 
Companies are focusing on minimizing the carbon cost of 
products and are interested in increasing the circularity and 
overall materials cost. Two illustrative examples underscore 
this transformative shift in the service landscape.

54

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel Sustainability is expected to become a defining theme in the 
automotive aftermarket, with a focus on “green parts” and 
sustainable material sourcing. Initiatives such as recycling 
programs for lithium-ion batteries, boasting recycling rates 
of up to 95 percent, are emblematic of this commitment. The 
adoption of remanufactured parts further contributes to 
reducing CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and the use of 
natural resources, aligning with strong regulatory mandates 
in the European Union. This is an area in which OEMs are well 
positioned, with many automotive customers still preferring 
OEM parts over substitutes and more than half of customers 
open to refurbished or remanufactured parts. Green logistics 
practices, including more-efficient distribution and lower 
return rates, promise to spur sustainability even more. Green 
workshops are becoming qualified to handle new technology 
incidents, enabling over-the-air updates and recalibrations 
to enhance efficiency. Leveraging analytics and technologies, 
such as digital twins and machine learning, aids in forecasting 
vehicle failures, optimizing maintenance effectiveness, and 
advancing sustainability in the automotive aftermarket.22 

The second example illustrates the paradigm shift in the 
healthcare sector, particularly with the next generation of 
anesthesia machines. These innovative machines are designed 
to adapt to evolving clinic needs and offer a compact and 
cost-effective solution, enhancing workflow for medical 
professionals. The approach prioritizes flexibility, enabling 
the addition and customization of applications per physician 
requirements. This approach minimizes environmental impact 
by reducing the use of disposables and cuts development 
costs via the utilization of existing components. Notably, 
the product boasts more than 90 percent recyclable parts, 
significantly lower manufacturing costs, and sustainable 
materials, further exemplifying the fusion of innovation and 
sustainability in the service sector.

Hofmann, Denis Hörner, and Sebastian Kempf, “Making every part count: A 
component view on disruption in the automotive aftermarket for light vehicles 
until 2030,” McKinsey, May 17, 2021.

55

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel Higher-than-expected maturity in ‘remotization’

A notable trend in the future of the services sector is the 
continuously growing maturity in the “remotization” of  
offerings. This has been particularly prominent in workforce 
management (WFM), including both strategic and operational 
planning aspects. WFM covers a range of functions, such as 
forecasting, scheduling, and the optimization of labor-related 
business processes, all of which have been affected by the 
remotization trend.

This development is applicable across diverse workforces, 
ranging from store associates and call center representatives 
to field technicians and construction engineers. WFM 
processes have traditionally been predominantly manual, 
relying on statistical models rooted in historical trends and 
often subject to manual overrides because of entrenched 
practices. Errors in WFM can have significant business 
repercussions, including over- or understaffing, compromised 
service levels, excess idle time, and increased overtime costs. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted substantial pressure  
on WFM while simultaneously opening new opportunities  
for innovation.

Changing workforce dynamics and the evolving nature of 
work require more-complex forecasting models that consider 
multiple variables to comprehend underlying drivers. This, 
in turn, has paved the way for innovative service models, 
harnessing sophisticated WFM tools.

One compelling facet of this evolution is the emergence 
of fully remotized offerings for field services, with leaders 
implementing three main technologies: assisted activities, 
featuring interactive step-by-step guidance for complex 
interventions and voice-controlled interfaces for hands-
free operations; remote support, facilitated by video 
connections and augmented reality instructions; and video 
tutorials, available to the workforce on open platforms. These 
advancements not only enhance operational efficiency but 
also ensure consistency and broad reach across the workforce, 
reflecting the maturation of remotization in the services sector.

of remotization is the 
emergence of fully

for field services.

57

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel Localization paradigm

The localization paradigm is gaining prominence in the service 
business, with customers increasingly looking for local service 
providers for global brands. 

This trend toward localization may be new for many 
manufacturers, but it has been a familiar paradigm in the 
automotive industry for much of its existence, with OEMs 
building symbiotic relationships with their independent dealer 
networks in local communities across the world for years. 
The lessons learned from these partnerships, which involve 
developing integrated strategies to create seamless customer 
experiences, are valuable for other industries as localization 
becomes more important. 

To deliver standardized aftermarket services through local 
workers or partners, companies are increasingly investing in 
extensive training programs. To ensure a consistent delivery 
model across various locations, this training can be in-house or 
for dealers and can be provided online or at dealer campuses. 
Additionally, companies forge partnerships with professional 
training vendors to provide comprehensive training solutions, 
while certification courses align with customer expectations 
gathered from surveys and other expressed customer needs. 
This localization approach ensures standardized excellence in 
service delivery across the board.

Online marketplaces

Taking cues from B2C spheres, online marketplaces for B2B 
business have been growing in volume and breadth as well. The 
importance of B2B online marketplaces has helped to redefine 
customer journeys and open new sales channels. 

Companies such as Aero-Bay are pioneering innovative 
platforms where end users, MROs, and OEMs can seamlessly 
trade aftermarket parts for a variety of aircraft and 
components. These digital marketplaces are streamlining 
the procurement and distribution of critical components, 
fostering greater efficiency and transparency. Such platforms 

58

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel offer a centralized hub for buyers and sellers, facilitating cost-
effective transactions, reducing lead times, and enhancing the 
overall supply chain ecosystem. 

As online marketplaces continue to evolve, they are expected 
to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of various service 
sectors, optimizing operations, and fostering collaboration. 
These marketplaces can create both opportunities and 
threats. On the one hand, they offer additional sales channels 
and opportunities to sell into the aftermarket; on the other, 
they make it easier for sellers of non-OEM refurbished parts 
(for example, used-serviceable-material parts in aviation) 
or substitute parts (such as parts-manufacturer-approval 
parts in aviation) to find and sell to customers. It’s therefore 
important to participate in these marketplaces with the OEM’s 
differentiation at the forefront of the conversation.

Building ecosystems around products

Many leading companies are investing in building ecosystems 
for their aftermarket offerings. These ecosystems are made 
up of interconnected sets of services that enable users to 
meet diverse cross-sectoral needs within a unified, integrated 
experience. Within these ecosystems, value creation occurs 
through the integration of customer journeys, addressing 
critical pain points with tailor-made solutions.

This approach to building ecosystems around products has 
gained traction across various industries. For instance, telcos 
across geographies have made efforts to cultivate vibrant 
ecosystems around social networking, messaging, gaming, 
entertainment, financial services, and business tech solutions. 
These interconnected ecosystems keep customers engaged 
with the telco conveners, keeping them relevant and providing 
additional revenue streams beyond the core offering. 

In mobility, there has been growth in the use of digital platforms 
that facilitate the trading of repairs and spare parts. These 
platforms streamline the entire customer journey, enhancing 
the overall experience. Some automotive players are offering 
subscription-based services that provide all-inclusive 

59

Why aftermarket and service are vital to OEMs—and how to excel packages (such as maintenance, tire changes, and insurance) 
that goes beyond the traditional car-buying offer. They also 
offer third-party services, such as connections to mobile 
phone operating systems, mobile data subscriptions to 
power infotainment systems, and charging network and fuel 
subscriptions. While these might not all be core offerings for 
OEMs, they are relevant services for which OEMs have a right 
of first refusal to keep within their own ecosystems. 

Even the agricultural sector has embraced digital platforms. 
Manufacturers are now providing farmers with a wide array 
of administrative, consulting, and financial services within 
a cohesive ecosystem, leveraging their deep and trusted 
relationships with customers. 

This shift toward building ecosystems around products 
reflects a profound transformation in how industries deliver 
value, enhancing customer experiences and fostering 
integrated, cross-sector collaborations. It does, however, 
require increased attention toward the selection of the most 
appropriate partners or the development and integration of 
additional business units.

Considering disruptions to the  
service workforce

Significant disruptions are anticipated in the service workforce, 
spurred on by the continued rapid development of technology. It 
is important to note that jobs themselves will not disappear but 
rather will likely undergo a transformation, with a change  
in focus and required skills. Many leaders identify having a 
skilled workforce as the primary barrier to implementing growth 
strategies, highlighting the critical role of finding the right talent.

Automation, by leveraging existing technologies, has the 
potential to partially replace a number of aspects of current 
aftermarket service jobs. This includes a reduction in the 
required effort for diagnostics and fault finding, as well 
as administrative functions. On the other side, increased 
digitalization is expected to change existing jobs and create 
entirely new jobs. This global change across industries will

workforce. Therefore, the current workforce will need to 
transition to different occupations or undergo significant 
upskilling or reskilling within the next decade. Most global 
executives concur that upskilling and reskilling of existing 
employees should constitute a substantial part of their 
strategy to address skills gaps.

Given the scarcity of in-demand technology-based skills 
(which are often two to four times undersupplied), and in light 
of the costs and uncertainty associated with hiring and with 
shifting workforces, the business case for up- and reskilling 
employees is increasingly appealing—especially with the costs 
for providing such training decreasing. The continuing influx 
of millennials and Gen Z into the workforce brings in fresh 
skills, attitudes, and expectations, shaping the workforce of 
the future. Considering these recent developments, large 
tech firms invested significantly in the rollout of reskilling 
programs through digital training and learning platforms to 
ensure that their workforce is future-proofed and that critical 
capabilities, such as technological, social, and emotional skills, 
are available internally.

The rapid spread of gen AI has accelerated the need to 
onboard tech-related skills, but it also provides a great 
opportunity for efficiency in aftermarket processes. Two main 
use cases apply to industrial companies:

 — content generation to enable fast and automatic 

generation of contracts and reporting, with personalized 
communication advertisement reducing internal manual 
work and potentially speeding up processes

 — customer and operator interactions to improve agent 

productivity and the quality of answers, referencing all 
internal technical reports (both software- and hardware-
related) to significantly increase first-time-right responses

Again, the workforce required might be reduced, but on 
the other hand, setting up and maintaining these disruptive 
technologies will require workers in highly skilled roles.

For manufacturers of durable goods, the aftermarket has 
emerged as a crucial driver of growth and overall business 
success. By offering parts and services to customers after 
the initial sale, companies can tap into a lucrative revenue 
stream with profit margins that can be up to four times as 
high as they are for new units. A robust aftermarket strategy 
can not only increase operational cash flow but also mitigate 
risk and improve the customer experience. However, each 
company must tailor its approach based on market dynamics, 
the competitive landscape, desired customer relationships, 
and the ability to seamlessly integrate aftermarket offerings 
into core operations. As companies develop their overarching 
business strategies, it is essential to consider how 
aftermarket services align with their goals and make  
informed decisions accordingly.
