A year of strong funding coupled with sturdy 
underlying fundamentals and significant 
technological advances reflected strong 
momentum in quantum technology (QT).

Updated McKinsey analysis for the third annual 
Quantum Technology Monitor reveals that four 
sectors—chemicals, life sciences, finance, and 
mobility—are likely to see the earliest impact 
from quantum computing and could gain up to 
$2 trillion by 2035 (see sidebar “What is quantum 
technology?”).

years ago, reflecting a shift in investments toward 
more-established and promising start-ups, with a 
focus on scaling them. 

In contrast to the private sector, public 
investments increased more than 50 percent over 
2022, making up almost a third of all investments 
in quantum technology. A range of countries, led 
by Germany, the United Kingdom, and South 
Korea, have announced significant new funding 
for QT development, bringing the global public 
funding total to date to about $42 billion. 

Private and corporate funding for quantum 
technology start-ups in pursuit of that value, 
however, took a notable dip. Investments 
decreased 27 percent from the previous year, 
with the biggest drop in quantum sensing start-
ups. This decline, however, was smaller than the 
38 percent decline in all start-up investment 
worldwide. Notably, the majority of funding (62 
percent) went to companies founded five or more 

Underscoring this momentum was continued 
strong growth in QT foundations. There was a 
wave of new or enhanced offerings (for example, 
start-ups that made their quantum computing 
accessible through the cloud) and significant 
technological advancements—especially in 
quantum error correction and mitigation—as well 
as a small increase in patents filed. In addition, we 
found a notable increase in quantum technology 

What is quantum technology?

Quantum technology encompasses three subfields:

 — Quantum computing (QC) is a new computing paradigm leveraging the laws of quantum mechanics to provide significant 
performance improvement for certain applications and to enable new territories of computing compared to existing 
classical computing.

 — Quantum sensing (QS) includes a new generation of sensors, based on quantum systems, that provide measurements of 
various quantities (for example, electromagnetic fields, gravity, or time) and that are orders of magnitude more sensitive 
than classical sensors.

 — Quantum communication (QComm) is the secure transfer of quantum information across distances, and it could ensure 

security of communication even in the face of unlimited (quantum) computing power.¹

1 Quantum cryptography draws on the exchange of a secret key to encrypt messages based on the quantum mechanical phenomenon of entanglement. Unlike any 
classical cryptographic protocol, it is in principle not possible to “eavesdrop” on messages exchanged with quantum cryptography without detection. However, 
early implementations have been shown to have some weaknesses due to, for example, physical implementations of the protocols.

compared to the 38 percent decrease for all start-
ups globally. The slowdown in the number of new 
QT start-ups founded continues (13 in 2023 versus 
23 in 2022). Deal sizes have decreased as well, with 
the average deal size being $40 million in 2023 
compared to $105 million in 2022 and $107 million 
in 2021. In line with this development, deal counts 
dropped to 171 in 2023 from 206 in 2022.

Private investment dropped while 
public investment surged, with a focus 
on scaling established start-ups 
In 2023, $1.71 billion was invested in QT start-ups, 
which represents a 27 percent decrease from 
the all-time high of $2.35 billion in 2022 (Exhibit 
1). Nonetheless, the decrease is smaller when 

There are several factors causing the decrease in 
private investment into QT, including a significant 
shift in focus toward generative AI as well as lingering 
perceptions of QT being a long-term technology 
whose potential in various sectors is still being 
understood and evaluated.

About the Quantum Technology Monitor research

Our research covers the three main areas of quantum technologies: quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum 
communication. The analysis is based on inputs from various data sources, including publicly available data sources and expert 
interviews. Because not all deal values are publicly disclosed, this research does not provide a definitive or exhaustive list of 
start-up and funding activities. Minor data deviations may exist as databases are updated.

Public funding for quantum technologies, on 
the other hand, jumped more than 50 percent 
over 2022. While China and the United States 
have previously dominated QT public investment, 
new announcements from Australia, Canada, 
Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, South 
Korea, and the United Kingdom reflected a 
growing realization among a broader range of 
governments of the importance of QT; South 
Korea and the United Kingdom, in particular, 
made significant increases to their funding levels 
(Exhibit 2).

Most of these national initiatives aim to establish 
technological leadership and sovereignty and 
spur private investments for quantum technology 
development. For example, the aim of the United 
Kingdom’s National Quantum Strategy, which 
includes $3.1 billion in public funding over ten 
years, is not only to allow the United Kingdom to 
be a leading quantum-enabled economy but also 
to generate $1.3 billion in private investment in 
quantum technologies. 

Where did the funding go? The vast majority of 
investments have been in US companies (more 
than two times the amount compared to the next 
country), followed by companies in Canada and 
the United Kingdom. The majority of venture 
capital funding went to scaling up established 
start-ups, with more than 75 percent of the total 
investment value going to series B or later funding 
rounds. This suggests the establishment of more-
mature technological platforms for quantum 

computing and signals investors’ potential risk 
aversion to early-stage start-ups and unproven 
technologies or approaches—which also partially 
explains the 43 percent drop in new start-ups 
compared to 2022.

With quantum talent growing, 
countries need to focus on broad 
collaborations to build strong 
capabilities 
Talent development took a notable step forward 
in 2023, reflecting a positive focus on building 
QT’s foundations. There were 367,000 people 
who graduated in 2023 with QT-relevant degrees. 
Meanwhile, the number of universities with QT 
programs increased 8.3 percent, to 195, while 
those offering master’s degrees in QT increased 
by 10.0 percent, to 55. The European Union and 
the United Kingdom have the highest number and 
density, respectively, of graduates in QT-relevant 
fields. This surge helps explain why scientists 
from EU institutions contributed most often to 
quantum-relevant publications.

Building off of this talent and these investments 
to generate value is still a challenge because 
of limited access to state-of-the-art hardware 
and infrastructure, limited awareness and 
adoption of quantum technologies, and a 
lack of interdisciplinary coordination (such as 
between academia and industry) required to 
bring technologies to market. Collaboration 
between industry, academia, and government is

talent, as well as access to the latest scientific 
breakthroughs.

To address this issue, “innovation clusters” 
are emerging worldwide. These clusters are 
coordinated networks of partnerships between 
researchers, industry leaders, and government 
entities that contribute to the technological 
advancement of quantum technologies and drive 
regional value creation (Exhibit 3). 

 — Government support. Government support for 
innovation clusters comes in the form of public 
funding to support technology development at 
institutions and start-ups, as well as funding 
infrastructure for national research centers 
such as national labs, dedicated facilities, 
and capabilities for quantum technology 
development.

Most clusters share the following elements:

 — Academic hubs. Large academic institutions 
provide vibrant research ecosystems and 

 — Entrepreneurship. Start-ups are typically 
spun off from academic groups but retain 
ties to academic groups and take advantage 
of infrastructure within research institutions.

Start-ups also benefit significantly from 
mentorship (for example, through accelerators 
and tech transfer organizations) to develop and 
commercialize innovations.

 — Industry partnerships. Local companies or large 
corporate entities that are interested in applying 
quantum technologies provide funding or 
dedicated infrastructure to researchers.

Developing and scaling such regional innovation 
ecosystems (including research consortiums) will be 

a determining factor for achieving wide adoption and 
commercialization of quantum technology.

Technology breakthroughs, 
particularly in fault-tolerant quantum 
computing, reflect meaningful 
progress
The past year marked continued advances for all 
quantum technologies, with a range of enhanced 
and new QT offerings coming to the market. One 
advance was the transition from the NISQ1 era to the 

1 NISQ stands for noisy intermediate-scale quantum, an era in quantum computing characterized by use of quantum processors containing up to 
1,000 qubits, which were prone to noise and error.

FTQC2 era. Other key breakthroughs included the 
following:

 — Quantum computing. Quantum error-correction 

proposals and demonstrations by large 
companies show promise of steps toward 
large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing. 
Record qubit fidelity of 99.5 percent (by QuEra, 
MIT, and Harvard) and, most recently, 99.9 
percent (by Microsoft and Quantinuum) were 
achieved by combining new error-correction 
schemes and groundbreaking architectures for 
logical qubits. Shifting the focus from hardware 
alone to software and architecture-based 
schemes for error mitigation and correction 
promises to significantly reduce the hardware 
overhead (for example, physical qubit counts for 
each logical qubit) and accelerate timelines for 
the advent of universal fault-tolerant quantum 
computers. 

 — Quantum sensing. Researchers are developing 
improved techniques to control ensembles 
of solid-state spins for a range of sensing 
applications. Researchers at MIT, for example, 
developed a novel technique that could 
significantly improve the sensitivity of quantum 

sensing devices. Quantum sensing technology’s 
capabilities in monitoring, imaging, navigation, 
and identification will have a significant impact, 
both on their own and as enablers of processes. 
Our analysis shows that private sectors such 
as oil and gas, automotive and assembly, 
aerospace and defense, medtech, and media 
and entertainment, as well as the public sector, 
could experience disruptive impact from 
quantum sensing after 2030.

 — Quantum communication. Researchers are 
improving the performance of quantum key 
distribution, demonstrating longer transmission 
distances and increased data rates using 
innovative techniques. China and Russia both 
successfully tested the longest established 
quantum communication, which was over a 
distance of 3,800 kilometers. Researchers 
are also developing platforms for quantum 
memories using trapped ions, rare earth ions, 
and atomic vapors, and they are using trapped 
ions to demonstrate quantum repeaters, which 
operate at telecom wavelengths.
