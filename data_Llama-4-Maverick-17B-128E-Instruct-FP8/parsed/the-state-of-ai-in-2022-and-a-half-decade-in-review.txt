The state of AI in 2022—and 
a half decade in review

December 2022

The results of this year’s McKinsey Global Survey on AI show the expansion of the 
technology’s use since we began tracking it five years ago, but with a nuanced 
picture underneath.1 Adoption has more than doubled since 2017, though the pro-
portion of organizations using AI has plateaued between 50 and 60 percent for 
the past few years. A set of companies seeing the highest financial returns from AI 
continue to pull ahead of competitors. The results show these leaders making larger 
investments in AI, engaging in increasingly advanced practices known to enable 
scale and faster AI development, and showing signs of faring better in the tight 
market for AI talent. On talent, for the first time, we looked closely at AI hiring and 
upskilling. The data show that there is significant room to improve diversity on AI 
teams, and, consistent with other studies, diverse teams correlate with outstanding 
performance.

Five years in 
review: AI adoption, 
impact, and spend

This marks the fifth consecutive year we’ve conducted research globally on AI’s role in business, and we 
have seen shifts over this period. 

First, AI adoption has more than doubled.² In 2017, 20 percent of respondents reported adopting AI in 
at least one business area, whereas today, that figure stands at 50 percent, though it peaked higher in 
2019 at 58 percent. 

Meanwhile, the average number of AI capabilities that organizations use, such as natural-language 
generation and computer vision, has also doubled—from 1.9 in 2018 to 3.8 in 2022. Among these 

1 In the survey, we defined AI as the ability of a machine to perform cognitive functions that we associate with human minds (for example, 
natural-language understanding and generation) and to perform physical tasks using cognitive functions (for example, physical robotics, 
autonomous driving, and manufacturing work).
2 In 2017, the definition for AI adoption was using AI in a core part of the organization’s business or at scale. In 2018 and 2019, the definition 
was embedding at least one AI capability in business processes or products. In 2020, 2021, and 2022, the definition was that the 
organization has adopted AI in at least one function.

year, while natural-language text understanding has advanced from the middle of the pack in 2018 to the front of the 
list just behind computer vision. 

Responses show an increasing number of AI capabilities embedded in 
organizations over the past  ve years.

the top spot each of the past four years.

Second, the level of investment in AI has increased  alongside its rising adoption. For example, five years  
ago, 40 percent of respondents at organizations using AI reported more than 5 percent of their digital 
budgets went to AI, whereas now more than half of respondents report that level of investment. Going 
forward, 63 percent of respondents say they expect their organizations’ investment to increase over the  
next three years.

Third, the specific areas in which companies see value from AI have evolved.  In 2018, manufacturing and 
risk were the two functions in which the largest shares of respondents reported seeing value from AI 
use. Today, the biggest reported revenue effects are found in marketing and sales, product and service 
development, and strategy and corporate finance, and respondents report the highest cost benefits 
from AI in supply chain management. The bottom-line value realized from AI remains strong and largely 
consistent. About a quarter of respondents report this year that at least 5 percent of their organizations’ 
EBIT was attributable to AI in 2021, in line with findings from the previous two years, when we’ve also 
tracked this metric. 

Lastly, one thing that has remained concerningly consistent is the level of risk mitigation organizations 
engage in to bolster digital trust. While AI use has increased, there have been no substantial increases in 
reported mitigation of any AI-related risks from 2019—when we first began capturing this data—to now.

The state of AI in 2022—and a half decade in reviewMcKinsey commentary
Michael Chui 
Partner, McKinsey Global Institute

Over the past half decade, during which we’ve been conducting our global survey, we have seen 
the   “AI winter” turn into an “AI spring.” However, after a period of initial exuberance, we appear to 
have reached a plateau, a course we’ve observed with other technologies in their early years of 
adoption. We might be seeing the reality sinking in at some organizations of the level of organiza-
tional change it takes to successfully embed this technology. 

In our work, we’ve encountered companies that get discouraged because they went into AI 
thinking it would be a quick exercise, while those taking a longer view have made steady prog-
ress by transforming themselves into learning organizations that build their AI muscles over time. 
These companies gradually incorporate more AI capabilities and stand up increasingly more 
applications progressively faster and more easily thanks to lessons from past successes as well 
as failures. They not only invest more, but they also invest more wisely, with the goal of creating a 
veritable AI factory that enables them to incorporate more AI in more areas of the business, first in 
adjacent ones where some existing capabilities can be repurposed and then into entirely  
new ones.

There is, at a high level, an emerging playbook for getting maximum value from AI. Each year that 
we conduct our research, we see a group of leaders engaging in the types of practices that help 
execute AI successfully. It’s paying off in the form of actual bottom-line impact at significant levels. 
We also see it every day as we guide others on their AI journeys. It’s not easy work, but as has 
been the case with previous technologies, the gains will go to those who stay the course.

Those taking a longer view 
have made steady progress by 
transforming themselves into 
learning organizations that build 
their AI muscles over time.

The state of AI in 2022—and a half decade in reviewAI use and sustainability efforts

The survey findings suggest that many organizations 
that have adopted AI are integrating AI capabilities into 
their sustainability efforts and are also actively seeking 
ways to reduce the environmental impact of their AI 
use (exhibit). Of respondents from organizations that 
have adopted AI, 43 percent say their organizations are 
using AI to assist in sustainability efforts, and 40 per-
cent say their organizations are working to reduce the 
environmental impact of their AI use by minimizing the 
energy used to train and run AI models. As companies 
that have invested more in AI and have more mature 
AI efforts than others, high performers are 1.4 times 
more likely than others to report AI-enabled sustain-
ability efforts as well as to say their organizations are 
working to decrease AI-related emissions. Both efforts 

Exhibit 

are more commonly seen at organizations based in 
Greater China, Asia–Pacific, and developing markets, 
while respondents in North America are least likely to 
report them. 

When asked about the types of sustainability efforts 
using AI, respondents most often mention initiatives 
to improve environmental impact, such as optimiza-
tion of energy efficiency or waste reduction. AI use 
is least common in efforts to improve organizations’ 
social impact (for example, sourcing of ethically made 
products), though respondents working for North 
American organizations are more likely than their 
peers to report that use.

The state of AI in 2022—and a half decade in reviewMind the gap: AI 
leaders pulling ahead

Over the past five years, we have tracked the leaders in AI—we refer to them as AI high performers—and 
examined what they do differently. We see more indications that these leaders are expanding their 
competitive advantage than we find evidence that others are catching up.

First, we haven’t seen an expansion in the size of the leader group. For the past three years, we have 
defined AI high performers as those organizations that respondents say are seeing the biggest 
bottom-line impact from AI adoption—that is, 20 percent or more of EBIT from AI use. The proportion of 
respondents falling into that group has remained steady at about 8 percent. The findings indicate that 
this group is achieving its superior results mainly from AI boosting top-line gains, as they’re more likely 
to report that AI is driving revenues rather than reducing costs, though they do report AI decreasing 
costs as well.

Next, high performers are more likely than others to follow core practices that unlock value, such 
as linking their AI strategy to business outcomes.³ Also important, they are engaging more often 
in “frontier” practices that enable AI development and deployment at scale, or what some call the 
“industrialization of AI.” For example, leaders are more likely to have a data architecture that is modular 
enough to accommodate new AI applications rapidly. They also often automate most data-related 
processes, which can both improve efficiency in AI development and expand the number of applications 
they can develop by providing more high-quality data to feed into AI algorithms. And AI high performers 
are 1.6 times more likely than other organizations to engage nontechnical employees in creating AI 
applications by using emerging low-code or no-code programs, which allow companies to speed up 
the creation of AI applications. In the past year, high performers have become even more likely than 
other organizations to follow certain advanced scaling practices, such as using standardized tool sets 
to create production-ready data pipelines and using an end-to-end platform for AI-related data science, 
data engineering, and application development that they’ve developed in-house.

High performers might also have a head start on managing potential AI-related risks, such as personal 
privacy and equity and fairness, that other organizations have not addressed yet. While overall, we 
have seen little change in organizations reporting recognition and mitigation of AI-related risks since 
we began asking about them four years ago, respondents from AI high performers are more likely 
than others to report that they engage in practices that are known to help mitigate risk. These include 
ensuring AI and data governance, standardizing processes and protocols, automating processes such 
as data quality control to remove errors introduced through manual work, and testing the validity of 
models and monitoring them over time for potential issues. 

3All questions about AI-related strengths and practices were asked only of the 744 respondents who said their organizations had adopted 
AI in at least one function, n = 744.

³³³The state of AI in 2022—and a half decade in reviewInvestment is yet another area that could contribute to the widening of the gap: AI high performers are 
poised to continue outspending other organizations on AI efforts. Even though respondents at those 
leading organizations are just as likely as others to say they’ll increase investments in the future, they’re 
spending more than others now, meaning they’ll be increasing from a base that is a higher percentage of 
revenues. Respondents at AI high performers are nearly eight times more likely than their peers to say their 
organizations spend at least 20 percent of their digital-technology budgets on AI-related technologies.  
And these digital budgets make up a much larger proportion of their enterprise spend: respondents at AI 
high performers are over five times more likely than other respondents to report that their organizations 
spend more than 20 percent of their enterprise-wide revenue on digital technologies. 

Finally, all of this may be giving AI high performers a leg up in attracting AI talent. There are indications 
that these organizations have less difficulty hiring for roles such as AI data scientist and data engineer. 
Respondents from organizations that are not AI high performers say filling those roles has been “very 
difficult” much more often than respondents from AI high performers do.

The bottom line: high performers are already well positioned for sustained AI success, improved efficiency 
in new AI development, and a resultingly more attractive environment for talent. The good news for 
organizations outside the leader group is that there’s a clear blueprint of best practices for success.

Respondents at AI high performers are nearly 
eight times more likely than their peers to say their

The state of AI in 2022—and a half-decade in review

McKinsey commentary
Bryce Hall 
Associate partner

Over the years of our research, we’ve continued to refine our understanding of the specific 
practices that leading companies are doing well and the capabilities they have in place to capture 
value from AI. Recently, a new set of “frontier” practices has emerged as organizations shift from 
experimenting with AI to industrializing it. These include machine learning operations (MLOps) 
practices such as assetization, or turning elements like code into reusable assets that can be 
applied over and over in different business applications.

But over the years, we’ve also consistently seen a set of foundational practices that these 
organizations are getting right. Through our work, we’ve learned not to describe these as “basic” 
practices, because they are some of the most difficult to implement. Many of these involve the 
people elements that need to be in place for companies to adopt AI successfully, such as having 
a clear understanding of what specific tech talent roles are needed and successfully integrating 
AI into business processes and decision making. As proven in many cases, AI engines and people 
together can create much more value than either can individually. 

As the AI frontier advances, we continue to be inspired by some truly innovative applications of 
AI, such as  the use of AI to identify new drugs, create hyperpersonalized recommendations for 
consumers, and power AI simulations in digital twins to optimize performance across a variety 
of settings. As individual AI capabilities, such as natural-language processing and generation, 
continue to improve and democratize, we’re excited to see a wave of new applications emerge and 
more companies capture value from AI at scale.

hot roles, continued 
diversity woes

Our first detailed look at the AI talent picture signals the maturation of AI, surfaces the most common 
strategies organizations employ for talent sourcing and upskilling, and shines a light on AI’s diversity 
problem—while showing yet again a link between diversity and success.

Hiring is a challenge, but less so for high performers
Software engineers emerged as the AI role that survey responses show organizations hired most 
often in the past year, more often than data engineers and AI data scientists. This is another clear sign 
that many organizations have largely shifted from experimenting with AI to actively embedding it in 
enterprise applications.  

Unfortunately, the tech talent shortage shows no sign of easing, threatening to slow that shift for 
some companies. A majority of respondents report difficulty in hiring for each AI-related role in the

The state of AI in 2022—and a half decade in reviewpast year, and most say it either wasn’t any easier or was more difficult to acquire this talent than in years 
past. AI data scientists remain particularly scarce, with the largest share of respondents rating data 
scientist as a role that has been difficult to fill, out of the roles we asked about. 

As mentioned earlier, we see some signs that AI high performers have a slightly easier time hiring than 
other organizations, but they still report difficulty more often than not. What’s more evident from the 
survey findings is their focus on hiring for AI industrialization and business value optimization. For 
example, they’re more than twice as likely to have hired a ML engineer in the past year—a role focused on 
optimizing the ML models built by data scientists for performance and scalability, as well as automating 
the machine learning pipeline, from data ingestion to prediction generation. Respondents at high 
performers are also nearly twice as likely as others to say they have hired an AI product manager to 
oversee AI application development and adoption and more than three times as likely to have hired an 
analytics translator, two roles that ensure that AI applications deliver business value.

Most respondents say that hiring for each AI-related role has been difficult      
in the past year and hasn’t become easier over time.

Reskilling and upskilling are common alternatives to hiring  
When it comes to sourcing AI talent, the most popular strategy among all respondents is reskilling 
existing employees. Nearly half are doing so. Recruiting from top-tier universities as well as 
from technology companies that aren’t in the top tier, such as regional leaders, are also common 
strategies. But a look at the strategies of high performers suggests organizations might be best 
served by tapping as many recruiting channels as possible. These companies are doing more than 
others to recruit AI-related talent from various sources. The findings show that while they’re more 
likely to recruit from top-tier technical universities and tech companies, they’re also more likely 
to source talent from other universities, training academies, and diversity-focused programs or 
professional organizations.

Responses suggest that both AI high performers and other organizations are upskilling technical and 
nontechnical employees on AI, with nearly half of respondents at both AI high performers and other 
organizations saying they are reskilling as a way of gaining more AI talent. However, high performers 
are taking more steps than other organizations to build employees’ AI-related skills. 

Respondents at high performers are nearly three times more likely than other respondents to say their 
organizations have capability-building programs to develop technology personnel’s AI skills. The most 
common approaches they use are experiential learning, self-directed online courses, and certification 
programs, whereas other organizations most often lean on self-directed online courses. 

High performers are also much more likely than other organizations to go beyond providing access 
to self-directed online coursework to upskill nontechnical employees on AI. Respondents at high

programs to nontechnical personnel.

Increasing diversity on AI teams is a work in progress
We also explored the level of diversity within organizations’ AI-focused teams, and we see that there 
is significant room for improvement at most organizations. The average share of employees on these 
teams at respondents’ organizations who identify as women is just 27 percent. The share is similar when 
looking at the average proportion of racial or ethnic minorities developing AI solutions: just 25 percent. 
What’s more, 29 percent of respondents say their organizations have no minority employees working on 
their AI solutions.

Some companies are working to improve the diversity of their AI talent, though there’s more being 
done to improve gender diversity than ethnic diversity. Forty-six percent of respondents say their 
organizations have active programs to increase gender diversity within the teams that are developing AI 
solutions, through steps such as partnering with diversity-focused professional associations to recruit 
candidates. One-third say their organizations have programs to increase racial and ethnic diversity. We 
also see that organizations with women or minorities working on AI solutions often have programs in 
place to address these employees’ experiences of these employees. 

In line with previous McKinsey studies, the research shows a correlation between diversity and 
outperformance. Organizations at which respondents say at least 25 percent of AI development 
employees identify as women are 3.2 times more likely than others to be AI high performers. Those at 
which at least one-quarter of AI development employees are racial or ethnic minorities are more than 
twice as likely to be AI high performers.

As I look at these results on talent, I see both how far we’ve come with AI and how much 
work is still to be done in some areas. 

Five or so years ago, software engineering would not have been classified as the highest-
priority AI role because many organizations focused on simply building discrete models 
as they experimented with the technology. But as the business value became clear, 
organizations realized the need for insights from AI to be delivered into a front end where 
people can consume and apply them for impact. The hiring of machine learning (ML) 
engineers similarly shows the maturation of AI; businesses need this role now because 
they’re working to embed ML into systems regularly and reliably.

On the other hand, despite knowing for close to a decade about the growing need for roles 
like data scientists and data engineers, we still haven’t moved the needle enough on the 
supply side. Hiring from boot camps is picking up because experienced talent is just not 
available. It isn’t easy to set up learning pathways for this fresh talent, but organizations 
have little choice. Reskilling efforts are also a big undertaking, but it’s necessary to fill the 
gaps. To meet the need, we actually need many more organizations reskilling than what 
we’re seeing in these results.

The diversity figures are disappointing but sadly unsurprising. Data science is a team sport. 
Diverse perspectives are important. It has been shown time and again that bias issues will 
proliferate when organizations lack a diverse enough team to call out issues. And just like 
other research we’ve conducted has shown, diversity correlates with strong performance 
in addition to being the right thing to do. If not careful, with AI, lack of diversity can lead 
to distrust. Finally, it’s important to remember that these AI jobs are among some of the 
highest paid, and demand will only increase. We risk undermining the progress we’ve 
made to date on closing pay gaps for women and ethnic minorities if they are not equally 
represented in this high-demand skills base. We must continue to find ways to get more 
women and minorities engaged in STEM in their education years and beyond.

About the research

The online survey was in the field from May 3 to May 27, 2022, and from August 15 to August 17, 2022, and garnered responses 
from 1,492 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of 
those respondents, 744 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one function and were asked questions about their 
organizations’ AI use. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each respondent’s 
nation to global GDP.

The survey content and analysis were developed by Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global 
Institute and a partner in McKinsey’s Bay Area office; Bryce Hall, an associate partner in the Washington, 
DC, office; Helen Mayhew, a partner in the Sydney office; and Alex Singla, a senior partner in the Chicago 
office, and Alex Sukharevsky, a senior partner in the London office, global leaders of QuantumBlack, AI
