Executive summary

Welcome to the 2023 edition of McKinsey’s annual 
review of private markets investing. Our ongoing 
research on the industry’s dynamics and performance 
has revealed several insights, including the  
following trends:

the so-called denominator effect. Though few LPs 
thus far have abandoned commitment plans entirely 
or sold portfolios as they did 15 years ago, many 
have pulled back, particularly from smaller and newer 
funds, causing fundraising to decline.

The music didn’t stop, but someone turned it way 
down. Private markets have enjoyed strong tailwinds 
since the depths of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). 
Interest rates stayed low, credit availability was high, 
and valuations rose consistently. Each year since  
its inception, this annual publication has discussed 
new records in fundraising and deal flow while 
celebrating strong performance across asset classes. 
Even in 2020, when activity stalled briefly during  
the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, private 
markets hummed again in the second half. In almost 
every regard, 2021 was an exceptional year, but it 
was not a trend breaker. Markets climbed higher still, 
awash with central-bank-induced liquidity. In the 
first half of 2022, central banks fought roaring 
inflation with sharply rising interest rates, and public 
market valuations cratered. In the private markets, 
first-half deal activity softened but subtly so, nearly 
matching the record-setting pace set in 2021. 

The mood changed in early summer. Banks began to 
pull back, unwilling or unable to lend. Private markets 
deal volume plummeted, performance declined, and 
valuations fell—sharply in certain sectors. Still, 
private markets outperformed public markets on the 
way down, whether due to truly more resilient 
portfolios, a lag in timing, or manager discretion over 
their marks (private markets tend to mark up less 
quickly during ascending markets and mark down 
less quickly in falling markets). The discrepancy  
this year drove private market allocations higher on 
a percentage basis across institutional portfolios—
closer to preexisting targets for most, and above 
targets for many limited partners (LPs)—triggering 

Deal making slowed in the second half. After a 
frenzied 2021, private equity (PE) deal volume 
decreased 26 percent to $2.4 trillion, while deal 
count fell 15 percent to just under 60,000. The  
deal-making momentum of 2021 continued through 
the first half of 2022, and despite the striking 
slowdown in second-half deal activity, 2022 
remained the second most active year on record. 
The number of buyout and growth deals greater 
than $500 million decreased by 33 percent. Add-
on deals, which tend to be smaller, continued to gain 
share as a percentage of total deals. New platforms 
comprised 28 percent of total transactions in 2022, 
14 percentage points lower than five years ago. 

Real estate deal volume declined 20 percent to  
$1.1 trillion, also the second-highest year on record. 
Like PE deal making, first-half real estate deal 
making continued close to the record-setting pace 
of the second half of 2021, but second-half 
volumes declined precipitously. After more than 
doubling year over year in 2021, multifamily  
deal volume fell 29 percent in 2022, accounting  
for nearly half of the asset class’s overall decline  
in deal activity.

The denominator effect took hold. Global private 
markets fundraising declined by 11 percent to  
$1.2 trillion. Real estate (−23 percent) and private 
equity (−15 percent) declined most precipitously 
from 2021’s record highs, while private credit  
(+2 percent) proved more resilient. Macro economic 
headwinds, including rising inflation and interest 
rates, coupled with sharply negative public market

mentioned denominator effect, and LPs scaled 
down new commitments. Despite these challenges, 
2022 is likely to be the second-best fundraising 
year on record (after all data is reported), 
demonstrating—thus far—discipline and longer-
term thinking by LPs.

North American fundraising was resilient; Europe 
and Asia faced challenges. Fundraising results 
differed notably across geogra phies, more so than  
in previous years. Private markets fundraising in  
North America increased by a modest 2 percent 
year over year but declined in Asia and Europe  
by 39 percent and 28 percent, respectively. Since 
2017, fundraising in Asia has declined 16 percent  
per year, driven primarily by reduced investment in 
China. In 2017, for example, China represented  
83 percent of fundraising in Asia, a share that 
dropped to 34 percent in 2022. In Europe, an 11-year 
run of fundraising growth ended, largely due to 
geopolitical instability and broader macroeconomic 
challenges, including volatility in foreign currency 
exchange rates. A strengthening dollar accounted 
for a material portion of the dollar-based decline  
in fundraising in non-US markets.

Investors fled to known names and larger funds. 
Amid a pullback in commitments, an outsized share 
of capital flowed to the largest funds, as investors 
re-upped with their existing managers but reduced 
backing smaller and new funds. Funds over $5 billion 
collected a record $445 billion in aggregate, a  
51 percent increase over funds of a similar size in 
2021. Conversely, dollars raised by sub–$5 billion 
funds decreased by 28 percent. Just 2,141 funds were 
closed during the year, 1,600 fewer than in 2021  
and the fewest of any year since 2013. First-time 
fund launches also decreased by 40 percent.

Dry powder inventory spiked. Total private markets 
assets under management (AUM) reached $11.7 trillion 
as of June 30, 2022. AUM has now grown at an 
annual rate of nearly 20 percent since 2017. As of the 
second quarter of 2022, dry powder exceeded  
$3 trillion, reflecting an 8.4 percent year-over-year 
increase and marking the eighth consecutive year  
of growth. Dry powder inventory—the amount  
of capital available to GPs expressed as a multiple of 
annual deployment—spiked. In PE, inventory jumped 
from a historically low 0.9 times at the end of 2021, 
following a year of record deal flow that outpaced 
fundraising, to 1.4 times. That number is likely to

fundraising slowed.

values rose. However, cap rates started expanding 
toward the end of 2022, signaling heightened 
uncertainty across real estate markets. 

PE multiples contracted. PE buyout entry multiples 
declined slightly in 2022, falling to 12.9 times 
EBITDA from a record 13.2 times a year ago, while 
public market multiples compressed dramatically, 
declining to 12.0 from 14.6 times EBITDA. Financial 
services (−2.5 times) and informa tion technology 
(−2.2 times) recorded the largest multiple declines 
among PE subsectors, while rising commodity 
prices drove multiple expansion in raw materials  
and resources (+2.6 times).

PE posted negative performance for the first time 
since 2008. Global PE performance turned negative 
for the first time since 2008, posting a −9 percent 
return through September 1 and ending a five-year 
run as the highest-performing private asset class. 
Tech-focused buyout funds performed worse than 
other buyout funds for the second consecutive year, 
and venture capital (VC) underperformed buyout 
strategies for the first time since 2017. Counter-
intuitively, manager selection mattered less in 2022 
than in years past: the interquartile spread of returns 
of PE funds narrowed in 2022 to 21.6 percent  
from the prior ten-year average of 33.8 percent.  
As the industry narrative turned from beta to alpha, 
there was less alpha to be had in 2022.

Real estate served as an inflation hedge. One of 
real estate’s biggest draws for institutional 
investors is the long-held belief in the asset class’s 
ability to protect real value during periods of higher 
inflation. Indeed, real estate performance has 
exceeded inflation in six of the last seven inflationary 
periods, in part due to cap rate compression even 
during a rising interest rate environment. The pattern 
in 2021 and 2022 was no different: despite rising  
US Treasury (UST) rates, cap rates decreased, and 

Private debt had its moment (again). Private debt 
fundraising continued to grow last year (+2 percent), 
once again bucking the trend of other private asset 
classes. Institutional investors sought out the asset 
class for various features that are attractive in times 
of market volatility: current yield, floating rates,  
and relative insulation (via its senior position in the 
capital stack) from declining valuations. The 
prevailing market uncertainty also served as a shot 
in the arm for private credit deployment opportunities. 
As bank financing dried up in the second half of  
the year, private lenders stepped into the void, 
providing financing for more than 80 percent of PE 
transactions in the middle market. 

More mega-funds and a broader mandate for 
infrastructure. Infrastructure and natural resources 
fundraising rose to an all-time high of $158 billion, 
benefiting from the closing of a record five funds of 
more than $10 billion. The definition of infrastructure 
and natural resources continues to expand, with 
today’s funds now taking more equity risk than 
yester year’s did. Macroeconomic events had mixed 
impact across sectors: rising oil and gas prices 
drove a resurgence in demand for traditional energy 
invest ments, while growth in renewables  
fundraising continued amid the multiyear push 
toward decarbonization. 

Sustainable investing gained scale. 2022 will 
prove to be the best year yet for ESG-focused 
fundraising, with $24 billion raised through the first 
half of the year. Sustainability-related deals (the “E”) 
increased by 7 percent to nearly $200 billion, 
proving resistant to the deal-making headwinds 
that affected other asset classes. Venture capital 
accounted for 40 percent of this total, while on

led the pack for the third year running. But ESG’s 
growing impact on private markets goes beyond just 
dedicated funds and deals: most funds (of any 
strategy) now consider ESG risk factors in due 
diligence, and some explicitly include ESG concepts 
in their value creation plans. 

Private markets firms still have work to do on 
diversity. Considerations for diversity, equity, and 
inclusion (DEI) have become an important part  
of the fundraising, hiring, and investing landscape in 
private markets. LP willingness to allocate more 

capital to diverse deal teams is prompting more GPs 
(52 percent in 2021–22) to share DEI data during 
fundraising. On some diversity metrics, private 
markets firms compare favorably with corporate 
America, although ethnic diversity is not yet  
broad based. Ethnic, racial, and gender represen-
tation also remains imbalanced in senior positions 
and investing roles, suggesting that firms broadly 
continue to miss talent opportunities. Increasing 
representation across all levels will require 
managers to take fresh approaches to hiring, 
retention, and promotion.

About this report

McKinsey is the leading adviser to private 
markets firms, including private equity,  
real estate, private debt, and infrastructure 
firms, with a global practice substantially 
larger than any other firm. We are also the 
leading consultant partner to the institu-
tional investors that allocate capital  
to private markets, such as pensions,  
insurance companies, sovereign  
wealth funds, endowments, foundations, 
and family offices. 

This is the 2023 edition of our annual review 
of private markets.1 To produce it, we have 

developed new analyses drawn from our 
long-running research on private markets, 
based on the industry’s leading sources  
of data. We have also gathered insights 
from our colleagues around the world who 
work closely with the world’s leading  
GPs and LPs. 

This report consists of two main sections: 
the first more numbers-driven,2 the  
second more qualitative. The first section 
(chapters one to five) includes in-depth 
analysis of industry developments and 
trends in fundraising, performance,  

AUM, and deals across several private 
market asset classes: private equity, 
private debt, real estate, and infrastructure 
and natural resources. The second section 
(chapter six) explores how private markets 
firms are advancing their ESG agendas. 

We welcome your questions and sugges-
tions at investing@mckinsey.com.

funds of funds. We exclude hedge funds and, except where otherwise noted, publicly traded or open-end funds.
 For 2022, all data is based on reported numbers and will likely adjust as more figures continue to be reported. Performance data is as of September 30 for vintages  
2000–2019, unless otherwise noted; AUM data is as of Q2; and fundraising data cover the full year 2021. All data for Asia excludes Australia and New Zealand unless 
otherwise noted.

Private markets turn down the volume1 Private markets lose 

momentum 

Compared with a heady prior decade of robust growth, 2022 was a subdued year in the private 
markets. Following the record highs achieved in 2021, which were buoyed by pent-up demand 
from the earlier stages of the pandemic, several exogenous macroeconomic events stymied 
growth. High inflation persisted throughout most of 2022, prompting central banks around the 
world to increase interest rates at a historic pace. Quantitative tightening and dislocation in asset 
prices raised fears of an economic slowdown. And the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in 
Ukraine further exacerbated risks to the global economy, including higher commodity prices and 
disrupted supply chains. Amid the challenges, public markets sold off substantially, and  
though private markets remained relatively buoyant in the first half of 2022, they followed  
in the latter half.

These disruptions had substantial and varied impacts on private markets fundraising, 
performance, and AUM growth, with steep declines in certain regions and strategies, and 
pockets of resilience in others. 

Private markets fundraising fell 11 percent to $1.2 trillion, as the denominator effect affected 
some LPs’ ability to allocate capital. The decline was most evident in Europe and Asia, while, 
fundraising in North America increased slightly. Capital deployments into larger vehicles 
increased as investors re-upped with existing managers while forgoing commitments to smaller 
and newer managers. 

Performance of every private markets asset class declined relative to 2021 but continued to 
outperform public market equivalents at current marks, though private market valuation changes 
often lag those in public markets. In a break from years past, PE performed worse than other 
private asset classes, producing negative returns (through September 30, 2022) for the first time 
since 2008. Natural resources strategies, meanwhile, generated relatively strong performance 
for a second consecutive year, buoyed by elevated commodity prices.

While fundraising and investment performance declined, the industry’s growth held reasonably 
steady, with assets under management increasing to $11.7 trillion as of June 30, 2022.

Private markets turn down the volumeFundraising
Global private markets fundraising totaled  
$1.2 trillion in 2022, matching the prepandemic  
high achieved in 2019. However, fundraising  
fell 11.4 percent from its $1.4 trillion record haul  
in 2021 (Exhibit 1). Still, 2022’s total is the third 
highest on record (and will likely climb to second 
when full-year data is finalized). 

The so-called denominator effect may have  
played a role in the fundraising slowdown. As the 
value of institutional investors’ public investments 
depreciated faster than their private holdings, 
private allocations increased as a percentage of 

overall portfolios. For some LPs, this dynamic merely 
reduced the allocation “gap” that had existed 
between their actual and target private market 
allocations, but for others, it resulted in over-
allocations to one or more private asset classes. 
Because some LPs are obligated to maintain  
private markets allocations below said targets, 
these valuation-driven allocation changes 
contributed to lower new commitments—and, in 
select cases, the sale of private market holdings  
in the secondary market—last year. Still, most  
LPs appear to be staying the course, intent on 
avoiding the sins of the GFC, during which many  
LPs sold positions at a discount and reduced

impairing their portfolios.

North America, which accounted for two-thirds  
of private markets fundraising, was the only region 
in which fundraising climbed higher in 2022, 
increasing 2.4 percent to $799 billion (Exhibit 2). 
Across asset classes in North America, fundraising 
for natural resources and infrastructure grew  
82 percent, and private credit grew 11 percent. 
Closed-end real estate fundraising declined  
22 percent.

Fundraising in Europe fell 28 percent to $230 billion 
(measured in US dollars), the lowest total since 
2018, ending the continent’s 11-year growth streak. 
The decline was driven partially by foreign-exchange 
effects, as the dollar strengthened relative to most 
European currencies in 2022. Lower commitments 
may have been driven by record highs in dry powder 

at the end of 2021 and a more sober economic 
outlook relative to North America. The fundraising 
decline was broad based, with totals in closed- 
end real estate, PE, and infrastructure and natural 
resources all falling more than 30 percent year  
over year. 

In Asia, fundraising declined for the fourth time  
in five years, falling 39 percent to $118 billion,  
59 percent below 2017’s $288 billion peak. The 
multiyear decline for Asia-focused funds—and a 
particularly notable drop in China-focused 
fundraising—resulted from a confluence of factors, 
including excess dry powder and changing 
governmental regulations. Across Asia, fundraising 
fell substantially in PE (−49.2 percent) and  
private debt (−24.6 percent), while infrastructure 
and natural resources fundraising grew by  
a modest 1 percent.

Private markets turn down the volume2022’s fundraising headwinds did not affect all 
managers equally. In a turbulent market, investors 
shifted new commitments to larger funds. Funds 
greater than $5 billion raised a record $445 billion, 
51 percent more than in 2021. Conversely, funds 
smaller than $1 billion raised just $349 billion,  
a decrease of 31 percent. Last year’s move toward 
larger funds accelerated a long-running trend. 
Funds smaller than $1 billion decreased as a 
percentage of total fundraising from 47 percent in 
2017 to 29 percent in 2022, while the share of  
funds greater than $5 billion grew from 21 percent  
to 37 percent over the same period (Exhibit 3).

A similar trend played out in fund count. The  
total number of funds of less than $1 billion fell by  
45 percent to around 1,900. By contrast, the 
number of funds of greater than $5 billion increased 
by nearly 40 percent to 39 funds.

Despite a more challenging fundraising year, 
established GPs managing larger funds succeeded 
in attracting significant investor commitments. 
Indeed, the top 20 fundraisers raised 32 percent  
of the total fundraising volume in 2022, which  
is the highest share since 2009 and a 9 percent 
year-over-year increase.

Private markets AUM totaled $11.7 trillion as of 
June 30, 2022 (Exhibit 4). AUM has grown at an 
annual rate of nearly 18 percent since 2017. In 
2022, a deteriorating macro environment coupled 
with lower availability and higher cost of debt 
slowed exit activity, driving growth in net asset 

value (NAV). Dry powder totaled more than  
$3 trillion, increasing 8.3 percent from the first  
half of 2021 through the first half of 2022 and 
marking the eighth consecutive year of growth. Due 
to a lag in reported data, market dynamics in  
the second half of last year are not reflected in 
reported AUM figures.

returns in 2022 than in 2021. After five consecutive 
years as the highest-returning private markets  
asset class, PE was the only asset class to generate 
negative performance, turning in a net IRR  
of −9.2 percent year to date as of September 30. 
Meanwhile, natural resources had its second 
straight year of strong performance, returning  
15.6 percent and leading all private markets asset 
classes (Exhibit 5).

marks often lag public valuations and benefit from  
a degree of valuation discretion. PE outperformed 
public markets indexes, with the MSCI World Index 
posting −25.1 percent returns through the first three 
quarters of 2022. Within PE, buyouts returned  
−6.0 percent through September 30, while venture 
capital returned −14.9 percent. Closed-end real 
estate, which generated a 2.5 percent net IRR 
through September, also outperformed public 
indexes, such as the FTSE Nareit Equity REITs Index, 
which lost 27.9 percent over the same period.

Private markets asset classes outperformed their 
corresponding public markets indexes, a consistent 
trend over the past two decades. In a turbulent year 
for public markets, that result is unsurprising; private 

PE has been not only the best-performing private 
markets asset class over the long run but also  
the asset class for which manager selection matters 
most. The median net IRR to date for PE funds

Private markets turn down the volumeraised between 2009 and 2019 was 20.1 percent as 
of September 30, which exceeds the top-quartile 
return of all other private asset classes. However, the 
spread between top- and bottom-quartile PE funds 
was 18 percentage points, which is 400 basis points 
greater than for any other asset class (Exhibit 6).  
So, while dollars put to work in PE broadly have been 
more productive than in other asset classes, the 
dispersion of fund performance in PE also presents 
the greatest opportunity for LPs to outperform  
(or underperform) through optimal fund selection. 
Performance relative to the median is often  
the key measuring stick for teams managing private 
asset portfolios.

Non-institutional capital 
comes in to focus
Institutional investors remain the dominant providers 
of capital into private markets, but non-institutional 
capital has grown in importance. Private markets 
are slowly becoming more accessible as regulatory 

changes and novel investment vehicle structures 
open private investment opportunities to high-net-
worth and retail-capital pools. GPs have eagerly 
responded to the opportunity. 

Investing in the private markets appeals to non-
institutional investors for the same reasons that it 
does to institutional ones: the potential for higher 
returns, lower correlation with public equity markets, 
and access to otherwise inaccessible markets and 
strategies. Fund managers, meanwhile, see non-
institutional investors as a $45 trillion global capital 
pool and a relatively untapped source of funds. At 
present, retail investor allocations to private markets 
range from 5–6 percent.2 As more institutional 
investors achieve asset-allocation maturity and slow 
the growth of their new commitments to private 
markets, non-institutional capital will be the next 
growth frontier for GPs.

Recent regulatory changes in the United States and 
Europe have facilitated this so-called democratization

Private markets turn down the volumeof private markets. Two salient examples: In 2020, 
the US Department of Labor issued a statement 
allowing select 401(k) plans to incorporate PE as  
a component of their investment plans. And in 
February 2023, the European Parliament voted  
to approve revisions to the European Long- 
Term Investment Funds that will relax rules 
restricting individual investment in private asset 
classes, including minimum investment and 
diversification requirements. 

With relaxing regulatory barriers and growing 
demand for alternatives among non-institutional 
investors, GPs have utilized enhanced distribution 
teams and structured vehicles. One common 
structure is the feeder fund, a vehicle that aggregates 
commitments from several individual investors into 
 a common pool that is then invested in a private 
partnership (such as a PE fund). While this is hardly  
a new structure (private banks have been 
assembling feeders for their wealthiest clients  
for years), these vehicles have grown more  
common and their utilization more widespread, 
driven by a handful of start-ups that have  
entered the space and grown quickly, easing the 
operational burden for GPs. 

Beyond feeder funds, several other vehicles enable 
private markets investing for non-institutional clients, 
including interval funds, tender funds, private real 
estate investment companies (REITs), and business 
development companies (BDC). None are new, but 
most have grown in relevance. In real estate, private 
REIT contributions has grown dramatically over  

the last several years, driven by the market entry of  
a few well-known players that built large sales  
teams to facilitate distribution. Two such vehicles 
faced liquidity challenges in recent months, when 
non-institutional investors sought exits. And in 
private debt, though non-institutional investors have 
long had access to BDCs, a new breed of BDC, 
known as the nontraded perpetual life BDC, has 
grown in popularity. These nontraded BDCs 
generated more than 80 percent of BDC asset 
growth last year through September.3 

New technology plays a role in promoting access for 
and distribution to non-institutional investors. 
Tokenized funds have grown in number, utilizing 
blockchain technology to fractionalize fund  
stakes into smaller tokens, lowering the minimum 
investment required for qualified US-based 
investors. In 2022, two large asset management 
companies announced plans to tokenize funds  
that span private equity, private credit, secondaries, 
and other asset classes. 

While addressing the non-institutional market is an 
enormous opportunity for private markets players, 
there are numerous operating challenges. A move in 
this direction will require substantial investments  
in distribution and reporting infrastructure, coming 
from either GPs themselves or the range of 
technology-oriented start-ups jumping into the 
space. Regulators are likely to watch closely as  
the market develops. Regardless, with mountains of 
potential capital up for grabs, GP interest in the  
non-institutional opportunity is only going to grow.

Private markets turn down the volume2

Private equity endures 
a tough year

On the heels of a banner 2021, which set records for fundraising and deal making and produced 
exceptionally strong returns, PE fell back to earth in 2022. Aforementioned challenges—the 
higher cost and lower availability of debt, rapidly declining public market valuations, and 
macroeconomic uncertainty—stifled growth, activity, and performance in what had been the 
best-performing private markets asset class for many years running. 

Globally, fundraising fell 15 percent from the all-time high achieved in 2021. LPs concentrated 
commitments among large funds as many investors chose to re-up with known, tested names 
while forgoing commitments to smaller, newer managers. In particular, megafunds gained 
prominence: 11 funds of more than $10 billion each were raised, totaling $170 billion collectively. 
VC and growth equity both had their second-largest fundraising year on record, cumulatively 
accounting for more than 50 percent of PE fundraising for the first time. 

AUM ascended higher, as it has in every year since the global financial crisis, to $7.6 trillion. 
Additionally, the deal-making momentum of 2021 continued through the first half of the year 
before falling dramatically in the second, weighed down by reduced credit availability and 
valuation uncertainty. Exit volume fell sharply, as sponsors chose to hold assets rather than sell 
into a declining-valuation environment. 

PE returns disappointed, recording the worst year (through September 30) since 2008, and PE 
ended a five-year run as the top-performing asset class. Because of the deterioration in 
technology valuations, VC and growth equity returns led the fall, in stark contrast to the last 
several years. The median VC and growth funds lost 6.3 and 7.3 percent, respectively, through 
the first three quarters of 2022, while the median buyout fund earned 0.9 percent.

14

Private markets turn down the volumeFundraising
Globally, PE fundraising fell 15 percent to $655 billion 
(Exhibit 7), the lowest sum collected by the asset 
class since 2017 (except during the pandemic-driven 
slowdown in 2020). Each major PE strategy4 
experienced fundraising declines greater than  
10 percent. Buyout, the largest PE strategy, 
recorded an 18 percent decline. Growth equity and 
VC, which each hit record fundraising levels in  
2021, dropped by 17 percent and 11 percent, 
respectively. The fundraising drop was broad-based 
across regions.

For North America–focused funds, a relative bright 
spot, fundraising declined just 2 percent from  
the record set in 2021. Despite the year-over-year 
decline, 2022 was the second-highest year  
on record for North American PE fundraising. 

Fundraising by VC and growth equity funds grew  
6 percent in the region, while buyout fell  
15 percent. A key driver of the region’s relative 
fundraising resilience: dollars shifted in favor  
of larger funds in 2022, and North America is  
home to more large funds than any other  
region. Indeed, seven PE funds in the region  
raised a record $10 billion or more, while  
only four such funds were raised in all other  
regions combined. 

Fundraising for Europe- and Asia-focused funds fell 
precipitously. European PE funds raised $93 billion,  
a 32 percent year-over-year decline and the lowest 
total since 2017, reversing the consistent, modest 
growth seen over the last four years. The fundraising 
decrease was most evident in midsize vehicles  
($1 billion to $5 billion), which declined 61 percent.

Private markets turn down the volumeEach major PE strategy experienced 
fundraising declines greater than  
10 percent.

Difficult macroeconomic conditions—which were 
perhaps most acute in Europe—and the strength-
ening US dollar are likely to have had an impact on 
fundraising momentum. 

Across the rest of the world, which encompassed 
just 7 percent of the global total, fundraising grew  
12 percent year over year. The increase was 
substantially driven by several large Australia and 
Australia-Pacific funds.

In Asia, fundraising fell 49 percent to $74 billion, the 
lowest total since 2013 and the fourth annual 
decline in five years. China-focused fundraising is 
responsible for much of the region’s steep decline. 
For example, in 2017, a peak year for capital  
raising in the country, China-focused funds raised  
$208 billion. In 2022, that total dropped to $34 billion. 
China represented more than 85 percent of PE 
fundraising in Asia in 2017 and only 46 percent  
in 2022. 

Several reasons explain the drop in China-focused 
fundraising. First, fundraising increased at a rapid 
pace through 2017 in Asia, particularly  
China, leading to a large amount of dry powder. From  
2014 through 2019, Asia’s dry powder, much of 
which is located in China-focused vehicles, grew to 
$312 billion, a nearly 200 percent increase. As  
a result, GPs eased further fundraising to focus on 
deploying stockpiles of committed capital. Second, 
new regulatory policy in China, installed in 2018,  
has limited nonfinancial entities’ ability to borrow 
capital to invest in PE funds. Third, the ramifications 
of COVID-19 and extended lockdowns have made  
it harder for GPs to organize fundraising roadshows 
and raise new capital for funds in the country.

Drivers of fundraising
Various factors contributed to the drop in fundraising 
momentum. First, heightened macroeconomic 
uncertainty had an impact on global financial markets 
in general and slowed fundraising across most 
private markets, including PE. In this uncertain 
environment, private markets investors showed a 
preference for lower-risk strategies. Consequently, 
the largest funds, which have exhibited lower  
return dispersion over time (Exhibit 8), managed to 
raise relatively greater capital. Second, fundraising 
regressed from the record-high volume of 2021, 
which was partially inflated by the backlog of funds 
unable to reach a final close in 2020 due to the 
pandemic. Third, the denominator effect closed the 
gap between current and target allocations for  
most LPs, driving some institutions into an over-
weight position. As of September 2022, PE  
(as marked) outperformed public markets by a 
considerable margin: PE’s year-to-date returns 
totaled –9.2 percent, compared with –25.1 percent 
for the MSCI World Index.5 As a result, the current 
portfolio value for 33 percent of PE LPs outstretched 
their respective targets in 2022, versus 27 percent  
in the prior year and just 17 percent in 2019. Within

the LP universe, nearly 50 percent of endowments, 
government agencies, and public pension funds were 
overallocated to PE as of the beginning of 2023. 

LPs have reacted to their overweight positions in 
myriad ways. Some LPs obligated to stay below their 
target allocation limit slowed or stopped allocating 
new capital. Others sold portfolios, although less so 
than last year, and a few continued to hold course, 
sticking to their long-term commitment plans. There 
were also some investors who simply raised their 
targets to accommodate the overweight allocations, 
indicative of their belief in the strategy’s long-term 
performance potential. 

Yet, across the board, a majority of LPs seemed 
intent to avoid what happened during the last 
downturn, when commitments ramped up rapidly 
prior to the GFC, peaking allocations into what 
turned out to be poorly performing vintages. It took 
some time before investors reduced new commit-

ments substantially or stopped altogether, so they 
sat on the sidelines in vintages that ultimately 
performed fairly well. Investors who faced liquidity 
concerns and pressure from board members also 
sold positions in the secondary market at substantial 
discounts, permanently impairing value. While 
secondary pricing has once again fallen sharply in 
the current environment, relatively few LPs have 
sold into that market thus far. (See later in this 
chapter for further discussion of secondaries.)

Concentration into larger funds
Fundraising challenges in 2022 were not borne 
equally by all managers. In last year’s report, we 
discussed the remarkably consistent industry 
structure in PE. The idiosyncratic timing of funds 
coming to market does drive annual volatility in 
fundraising, but a longer-term view reveals 
consistency. For example, the top 25 managers have 
accounted for 36 percent of the total fundraising  
on average over the last decade, with little variation 

17

Private markets turn down the volumein that number when considering a multiyear view 
(Exhibit 9). But 2022 was different: the largest  
25 managers raised 42 percent of the global total, 
the highest annual share since 2013. Meanwhile, 
everyone outside the top 250 managers raised just 
19 percent, the lowest share since 2014. 

In a year when investors concentrated their 
allocations amid a broader pullback in commitments, 
re-ups to existing managers sustained, and  
larger funds and their sponsors persevered. Dollars 
allocated to funds exceeding $5 billion grew  

25 percent year over year, while fundraising for 
vehicles of less than $1 billion fell by more  
than 34 percent.

Consistent with this shift to larger funds, the average 
fund size across PE strategies increased to 
approximately $410 million, up from $210 million in 
2016, while the number of funds fell 46 percent  
from a year prior, reigniting a multiyear trend after  
a temporary stay in 2021 (Exhibit 3). Megafunds 
played a key role in driving up fund size: a record  
11 funds of at least $10 billion closed in 2022,

Private markets turn down the volumecompared with nine such funds in 2021 and just four 
in 2020. Within buyouts, the average fund raised 
$1.25 billion, the second-largest size in the 
strategy’s history. Meanwhile, the count of funds 
smaller than $250 million fell by more than  
51 percent (Exhibit 10).

Increased concentration among larger funds may 
reflect investors’ move to limit risk in a volatile equity 
market. Typically, the median performance of larger 
funds is similar to that of smaller funds, but the 
dispersion of returns is narrower for larger funds. 
The environment was particularly challenging for 
first-time funds, whose fundraising fell to $32 billion, 
the lowest total since 2013 and the lowest share  
of total fundraising in at least 20 years (Exhibit 11). A 
single-year shift in fundraising can appear to be 
driven as much by supply as by demand, based on 
the timing of large fund families returning to market 
every three to five years. However, of the 22 funds 
that raised more than $10 billion from 2017 to 2019, 
just three such fund families raised a successor 
vehicle with a final close in 2022, indicating that 
first-time funds comprised the vast majority of the  
11 megafunds closed in 2022. 

AUM
Global PE AUM increased to $7.6 trillion in the first 
half of 2022. This continues a growth trend in which 
AUM has risen at an annual rate of more than  
22 percent since 2017. Within PE, the AUM mix has 
shifted considerably over time. Buyout accounted 
for 43 percent of the global total as of the first  
half, down from 55 percent in 2017. VC’s share was 
34 percent, up from 21 percent five years prior.

In Asia, VC accounts for 56 percent of PE AUM, while 
growth’s share was 25 percent. In contrast, buyout 
was the largest strategy in Europe and North 
America, accounting for 70 percent and 51 percent 
of each region’s overall AUM, respectively. The  
rest of the world’s AUM was more evenly split, with 
36 percent in VC, 30 percent in growth, and  
27 percent in buyout as of June 30.

PE dry powder reached an all-time high of nearly 
$1.9 trillion (Exhibit 12). Dry powder inventory on hand 
was 1.4, up from 0.9 years in 2021 (which was a

year). When year-end figures become available,

more, given that deal volume declined more rapidly 
than the slowdown in fundraising.

Performance
PE was not immune to broader valuation declines, 
and performance suffered in 2022, albeit less than 
that of public markets. As stated previously, this 
result is unsurprising, given a lag in reporting and 
manager discretion in valuation. For the first time in 
six years, PE was not the highest-performing private 

markets asset class. Instead, it was the only asset 
class to lose money as of September, recording a 
nine-month trailing pooled net IRR of −9.2 percent. 
Equity performance is relatively volatile, and the 
year’s performance followed a full-year return of 
39.5 percent in 2021 (Exhibit 13).

In 2022, negative returns were widespread across 
strategies, though sector focus played a consider-
able role in relative performance. By strategy, 
buyout had the strongest performance, returning 
−6.0 percent on a pooled basis for the three

Private markets turn down the volumequarters ending September 30. Growth and VC, 
both heavily exposed to tech, underperformed 
buyout by recording pooled net IRRs of −14.9 and 
−14.7 percent, respectively. This trend differs from 
VC’s strong outperformance over the last decade. 
Tech-oriented strategies dragged down buyout 
returns as well, posting returns of −11 percent after 
exceeding 35 percent in the previous two years. 
Tech performance in public markets mirrored the 
trend: the NASDAQ lost 32 percent in 2022, trailing 
the more balanced S&P 500 by eight percentage 
points. Meanwhile, the best-performing buyout 
sector year to date was energy, which gained more 
than 17 percent, driven by rising commodity prices. 
Consumer staples (6.5 percent) and industrials  
(6.0 percent) also performed relatively well.

prior ten years’ annual average of 33.8 percent, 
largely driven by the drop in top-quartile returns. As 
the industry narrative turned from beta to alpha, 
there was less alpha to be had in 2022.

Despite last year’s performance challenges, long-
term PE returns remained robust and resilient.  
PE has outperformed other private markets asset 
classes over all long-term increments across the  
last 15 years. The median net IRR of 2009–19 PE 
fund vintages was 20.1 percent as of September 30, 
exceeding the top-quartile return of all other  
private asset classes by more than 200 basis points 
(Exhibit 14). At the top end, PE’s performance has 
been exceptional, with top-quartile funds producing 
net IRRs of 29.8 percent or better. 

Counterintuitively, manager selection mattered less 
in 2022 than in years past. The interquartile spread 
of returns of PE funds—the gap between the bottom 
and top quartile—narrowed to 21.6 percent from the 

PE also continued to outperform its public markets 
equivalents, though valuation discretion in  
the current environment may play a role in that 
conclusion. A Kaplan Schoar PME analysis,

Deal activity
Globally, PE firms executed notably fewer deals than 
they did during 2021’s enormously busy transaction 
market. Deal volume fell 26 percent to $2.4 trillion, 
and deal count fell 16 percent to just under 60,000. 
Even so, 2022 was the second most active year  
for deal activity on record, with a particularly robust 
first half (Exhibit 15).

Private markets turn down the volumeGlobal deal activity slowed rapidly in the second  
half of the year as debt availability declined and 
economic uncertainty intensified. Indeed, volume  
in the first six months of 2022 fell just 5 percent  
from the same period in 2021, while second-half 
deal volume fell 45 percent. By historical standards, 
the fourth quarter was particularly slow—in fact,  
the least active quarter since 2017 (excluding the 
depths of the pandemic in early 2020). Market 
activity through early 2023 suggests sustained 
sluggishness in the first quarter.

Across regions, deal volume in North America 
declined 27 percent to just under $1.2 trillion, while 
volume in Europe fell 18 percent to $826 billion.  
The biggest impact was in Asia, where deal volume 
decreased by 43 percent to $228 billion (Exhibit 16).

In terms of strategies, global buyout activity fell  
25 percent to less than $1.7 trillion, and growth 
activity fell 18 percent to $254 billion. VC deal 
volume declined even further, falling 33 percent to 
$498 billion. The decline in VC deal volume was 
more dramatic in the second half of 2022, falling  
55 percent from the second half of 2021.

Among sectors, energy was the only one in which 
deal volume grew, buoyed by rising commodity 
prices. Energy deal volume grew by 6 percent year 
over year, following a 102 percent increase in  
2021. Volumes in the two most negatively affected 
sectors, consumer and materials and resources, 
fell 47 percent and 52 percent, respectively 
(Exhibit 17).

Private markets turn down the volumeAdd-on deals
Add-on deals have consistently grown in popularity. 
Add-ons represented 49 percent of the total buyout 
deal count in 2009, increasing to 68 percent in 
2021. In 2022, they accounted for 72 percent of all 
buyouts globally, with the largest concentration  
in North America (Exhibit 18). 

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has long been  
a core PE strategy, even more so today than in years 
past. Industry roll-ups, among other M&A-backed 
strategies, allow GPs to invest in smaller targets that 
often trade at lower multiples, benefiting from the 
resulting multiples arbitrage (for example, the 
combined business trading at the larger acquiring 
company’s multiple upon exit if the merger is 
successful). Today, PE firms also use M&A to enable 

cost-oriented synergies, accelerated product 
development, faster expansion into new markets, 
and new talent acquisition. 

Exits
Among PE deal categories, exits declined by the 
greatest degree in 2022, as GPs either struggled to 
find buyers in a liquidity-constrained environment  
or chose to hold assets rather than sell into an 
uncertain market. The decline in exits outpaced the 
decline in total deals such that the ratio of exits  
to investments as of the third quarter fell to 0.38,  
the lowest level since 2008. The decline in exits was 
most pronounced in North America, where PE  
exits (excluding VC) fell 65 percent year over year. In 
Europe and Asia, exits declined 37 percent and  
32 percent, respectively.

Private markets turn down the volumeGPs that did exit holdings often ended up selling  
to other sponsors. These so-called sponsor-to-
sponsor transactions represented 62 percent of  
all PE-backed exits through September, nine 
percentage points above the average of the  
prior decade. Meanwhile, IPO volumes dropped  
70 percent in 2022 year over year, and  
corporate M&A activity fell 37 percent. As  
a share of total deal volume, neither carve- 
outs (−1 percent) nor take-privates (4 percent)  
saw significant fluctuations.

12.7 times earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) during the 
period (Exhibit 19). In other words, an investor  
in 2020 paid 44 percent more to acquire the same 
EBITDA than it would have paid a decade prior. 

In 2022, median global buyout multiples declined  
to 12.9 times EBITDA from a record 13.2 a year 
earlier. In contrast, global public equity multiples 
declined more dramatically, falling from 14.6 to  
12.0 times EBITDA. 

Deal multiples and leverage 
From 2010 to 2020, PE and public markets multiples 
expanded steadily, with valuation growth in the 
private markets slightly outpacing that in public 
markets. The average median entry multiple in 
buyout, for example, increased from 8.8 times to 

Among sectors, the largest year-over-year declines 
in purchase price multiples were seen in information 
technology (which fell from 17.3 to 15.0) and financial 
services (14.0 to 11.5), while raw materials and 
natural resources saw an expansion (9.3 to 11.8).

Private markets turn down the volumeprivate markets sectors were generally consistent 
with changes in the corresponding public  
markets sectors.

Despite the rising cost of debt, ingoing leverage 
remained roughly the same as in the prior year,  
at just under 7 times EBITDA. Debt-to-capitalization 
ratios—and conversely, equity-check percentages—
also held roughly in line with 2021’s levels  
(Exhibit 20).

and a means by which GPs can continue managing 
high-quality assets. Theoretically, growth in the 
depth of the secondaries market should help when  
a wave of LPs are looking to change their holdings, 
such as in an environment influenced by the 
denominator effect, which means that there ought  
to have been an uptick in secondaries activity. Yet 
secondaries deal volume fell 18 percent in 2022 
from the record high of $132 billion in the prior year, 
perhaps reflecting the decreases in secondaries 
pricing and the tendency of LPs to stay the course. 

Spotlight on secondaries
In the last few years, the PE secondaries market has 
gained prominence as a liquidity tool, transitioning 
from an option of last resort to a more standard 
exiting- or reallocating-capital approach for LPs 

While LP-led secondaries deal volume declined  
13 percent to $56 billion, it still accounted for more 
than 50 percent of the total secondaries deal 
volume. Notably, first-time sellers made nearly half 
of these LP-led secondaries deals, doubling their

to grow in relative prominence, accounting for  
50 percent of all GP-led secondaries in 2022. 

Deal volume for GP-led secondaries—often a means 
for GPs to continue owning their well-performing 
assets on a new basis, lock in unrealized gains on 
assets, and return money to LPs—fell 24 percent, 
reversing a multiyear trend. Consistent with the 
broader trend in PE, GPs, which sell assets to 
themselves through continuation funds, elected to 
hold assets within existing vehicles rather than  
sell into a declining price environment. Meanwhile, 
single-asset continuation vehicles continued  

Fundraising
PE secondaries fundraising also declined for the 
second consecutive year, falling to $31 billion 
(Exhibit 21). After a record haul in 2020, the decline 
in the last two years can be mostly explained by  
the concentration in secondaries fundraising. Over 
the past decade, the ten most prolific fundraisers7 
have raised 45 percent of the total secondaries 
fundraising over the last five years. Of these

to an average of 87 percent of NAV, while VC  
pricing fell by 20 percentage points to trade at  
68 percent of NAV.8 

Even then, signs of a deepening secondaries  
market continue, given the growth in fundraising by 
managers outside the top ten. Though total PE 
secondaries fundraising halved year over year in 
2021 and fell another 20 percent in 2022, funds 
raised by GPs outside of the top ten reached a new 
high of $33 billion in 2021—a total that was nearly 
matched again in 2022.

Similar to traditional PE fundraising, North American 
secondaries funds outpaced the broader market, 
posting a 37 percent year-over-year increase.

Pricing
Secondaries pricing on LP portfolios declined  
11 percentage points across PE strategies. Buyout 
secondaries pricing decreased by 10 percent  

In any given year, secondaries pricing is influenced 
by the composition of vintage year, uncalled capital, 
asset class, quality of assets, and seller rationale. In 
2022, other factors exacerbated the downward 
pressure on prices, including the performance lag 
between private and public markets performance 
(for example, the “discount” to NAV reflects 
perceived valuation rather than stated asset prices) 
and supply dynamics (such as more potential  
sellers in the market given the denominator effect). 
The fact that first-time sellers were 50 percent  
of LP secondaries sellers, up from 25 percent in 
2021, suggests that a new set of investors  
utilized the market to offload positions to rebalance 
their portfolios in the current market context.

Real estate renovates

For real estate, 2022 was a year of relative highlights and challenges, with previously-struggling 
sectors finding stability, and top-performing sectors slowed by tailwinds.

In closed-end funds, AUM reached a new peak, as it has every year since 2016, and managers 
raised the second-highest total on record, led by commitments to opportunistic vehicles. Open-
end funds in the US grew NAV by 24 percent, with contributions exceeding distributions for the 
first time in two years. Office, retail, and hospitality—the sectors most affected by pandemic-driven 
changes in working, shopping, and traveling—showed signs of emerging stability. In office, for 
example, net absorption turned positive as attendance rates seemingly reached a new equilibrium.

Yet, like most private market segments, real estate experienced a downturn in 2022 compared 
with the record year it followed. Closed-end fundraising declined 23 percent year over year. Deal 
volume fell 20 percent, declining in each consecutive quarter throughout the year. Expanding 
capitalization (cap) rates across sectors, which represent the multiple investors are willing to pay 
for net operating income (NOI), drove performance lower. And multifamily and industrial—sectors 
benefiting from changes in living and shopping behavior—softened after rapidly rising rents  
and occupancy of the past two years boosted performance.

Signs of a flight to quality, or at least to better-known managers, emerged. The largest five 
managers accounted for 29 percent of all fundraising, the highest share of the last decade, and 
tenants favored class A real estate as they fought to attract and retain employees.

Finally, amid the broader slowdown in technology-oriented PE deal making, investments in 
property technology companies fell to the lowest total in five years. While the industry  
continues to digitize rapidly, companies leading that effort found fundraising more difficult  
than in years past.

31

Private markets turn down the volumeClosed-end funds
Closed-end fundraising totaled $166 billion, a  
23 percent decline from the record sum achieved in 
2021. Year-over-year fundraising declines were 
most pronounced in debt strategies, and in Europe.

Fundraising results differed across regions more 
than in most years. Asia-focused funds raised  
$25 billion, nearly matching the prior year, while 
fundraising in North America fell 22 percent to  
$113 billion. European fundraising fared even worse, 
falling 39 percent to $25 billion in dollar terms,  
the lowest total since 2012 and the fifth consecutive 
annual decline. 

Among risk strategies, fundraising declines  
were widespread with some variation (Exhibit 22). 
Opportunistic and value-add fundraising were 
relatively resilient, declining by roughly 15 percent-
age points each to $59 billion and $55 billion, 

respectively. The size of the average opportunistic 
fund grew 28 percent year over year to $768 million, 
a new record; that total was bolstered by two funds 
that collectively raised $30 billion. Lower-risk 
strategies encountered fundraising challenges. After 
three consecutive years of growth, debt fundraising 
declined by 47 percent year over year to $22 billion, 
perhaps due to rising yields in traditional fixed 
income. Closed-end core and core-plus fundraising 
declined by nearly a quarter. 

Returns
Returns in global closed-end real estate funds 
decreased following a historically strong 2021. 
Pooled-net IRR for real estate funds in the first three 
quarters stood at 2.5 percent, a full 23.3 percentage 
points below the 25.8 percent return achieved in 
2021 (but still an improvement over 2020). Though 
closed-end performance for the fourth quarter  
is not yet available, open-end marks suggest that

performance for the full year will end below the  
2.5 percent achieved through September 30. 

Despite recent volatility, long-term returns for 
closed-end real estate funds have been relatively 
consistent. Every vintage from 2009 to 2019 has 
produced a pooled-net IRR of between 8.8 percent 
and 18.5 percent as of September 30. The median 
net IRR to date for funds in that vintage set stands at 
11.5 percent, higher than all other private asset 
classes except PE.

AUM
Total global real estate AUM in closed-end funds 
grew to a record high of $1.5 trillion in 2022. The  
17 percent year-over- year increase was primarily 
driven by higher-risk strategies, though with  
some regional variation. 

Real estate dry powder reached an all-time high of 
$469 billion. Dry powder as a percentage of AUM 
increased two percentage points from last year’s 
five-year low to 32 percent; over the long term, dry 
powder has averaged 14 percent growth annually. 
Despite larger annual increases, dry powder 
inventory has remained consistent over the past five 
years, ranging from 30 to 35 percent of AUM. 

Flight to quality 
Two shifts in real estate provide evidence of a 
so-called flight to quality. One shift was in 
fundraising: amid a more challenging environment, 
LPs concentrated investments among larger 
managers. The other shift occurred in the demand 
for office space. As companies’ space needs 
became clearer, tenants favored higher-quality 
spaces, even at higher prices. 

AUM grew fastest in Asia, at 34 percent, outpacing 
the annualized average since 2017 by 18 percentage 
points. In North America, AUM rose 18 percent, 
while AUM in Europe increased just 10 percent, 
driven by a 16 percent annualized decline in 
fundraising since 2017.

Last year’s annual review of private markets 
commented on the surprising lack of consolidation 
in fundraising over the previous several years. As  
of a year ago, the industry looked as fragmented as 
ever, with the top five managers capturing just  
18 percent of commitments. Fundraising in 2022,  

33

Private markets turn down the volumeby contrast, was the most concentrated it has been 
since 2012, with the top five managers collecting  
29 percent of all dollars raised (Exhibit 23). However, 
in the long term, fundraising consolidation has been 
less prevalent. Over the last ten years, the top  
five managers consistently raised between 15 and  
18 percent of capital on a trailing five-year basis. 

Collectively, managers raised fewer but larger 
closed-end funds in 2022 relative to years past.  
The average closed-end fund raised a record  
$510 million, up 17 percent from the prior year. 
Meanwhile, the number of funds totaled just 325, 
down from 492 in 2021 and the decade’s peak  
of 548 in 2018. In total, the share of fundraising 
achieved by funds greater than $500 million 
increased from 64 percent in 2017 to 77 percent  
in 2022. 

The shift to larger funds is perhaps unsurprising.  
In real estate, larger funds have traditionally 
outperformed. Furthermore, the gap between first- 
and fourth-quartile performance among large  
funds is relatively narrow, suggesting lower risk in 
manager selection (Exhibit 24). As stated in last 
year’s annual review, the advantages of scale are 
evident and may grow. Large real estate players  
use their scale to attract talent, acquire complex 
portfolios, engage operators in systematic joint 
ventures (or buy operating companies wholesale), 
and invest in digital infrastructure for efficiency  
and insight. Scale may be among the most sustain-
able advantages in the asset class.

While capital accrued to scaled players in 2022,  
a second type of flight to quality was evident  
in shifting tenant preferences—a trend most

pronounced in office. Demand for office space has 
fallen as hybrid-work models have become the 
norm, with office attendance hovering at around 40 
to 65 percent of prepandemic levels. In that context, 
class A office properties have outperformed class B 
and C properties, whether through higher rent, 
higher occupancy, or both (Exhibit 25). Class A office 
outperformed on one or both metrics in all of the  
20 largest US cities except Phoenix and Chicago. As 
companies navigate what is important to employees 
in a postpandemic world, firms are willing to pay a 
premium to attract employees and entice them back 
into the office. The McKinsey Global Institute is 
analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic’s lasting impact 
on real estate and plans to release a report in  
the spring of 2023, in which more insights about the 
future of work, cities, and offices will be featured.

Open-end funds
Within open-end funds in the US, as represented  
by the National Council of Real Estate Investment 
Fiduciaries Open-End Equity (NFI-OE) Index, 
contributions exceeded distributions and redemp-
tions, reversing the 2020 and 2021 pattern and 
seemingly resuming a long-term trend: US core and 
core-plus vehicles received net inflows every year 
from 2010 through 2019. Gross contributions to 
open-end funds increased 11 percent in 2022 to  
$31 billion. Distributions and redemptions declined 
by less than 1 percent, resulting in a net inflow of 
$2.7 billion (or 1 percent of starting NAV). Growth in 
gross and net contributions may signal a rotation  
in risk preferences from riskier opportunistic 
vehicles, where fundraising grew rapidly in 2021, to 
less risky strategies.

Private markets turn down the volumeWhile cash flow to institutional open-end vehicles 
turned positive following net outflows in 2021, 
private real estate investment trusts (REITs), which 
target high-net-worth investors, experienced 
substantial net outflows. Some of the industry’s 
largest private REITs, which had previously grown 
rapidly and performed well, gated redeeming 
investors in December when redemption requests 
exceeded the ability of funds to responsibly fulfill 
those requests. One of the key benefits for open-
end products, whether retail or institutional, is 
enhanced liquidity relative to closed-end funds. A 
turbulent market in 2022 reminded the industry  
of the downside of offering investors liquidity from  
a pool of illiquid investments. 

perform assessments on a quarterly basis. Perfor-
mance varied across sectors, with office producing 
the lowest annual returns (−3.4 percent) and 
industrial producing the highest (14.6 percent). 

Reversing a long-term trend, the expansion of  
cap rates was a headwind for performance in 2022. 
Across sectors, cap rates increased 70 basis  
points to 5.2 percent from 2021’s ten-year low  
of 4.5 percent, representing the largest one-year 
expansion over the last decade. Still, cap rate 
expansion was more than offset by rent growth. 
Rents grew across all sectors, including in  
office, despite demand concerns driven by lower 
rates of office attendance.

Returns
Open-end fund performance declined considerably 
but fared better than that of closed-end funds.  
NFI-OE funds returned 8.2 percent on a net basis, 
compared with 22 percent in 2021. It bears noting 
that there is limited manager discretion in open-end 
valuation, because third-party valuation firms 

Across all private real estate, including closed-end 
and open-end funds, returns stand in stark contrast 
to the performance of public markets. Public REITs  
in the United States returned −25 percent through 
September 30, 2022, as measured by the FTSE 
Nareit, after gaining 41.3 percent in 2021. The dis-

Reversing a long-term trend, the 
expansion of cap rates was a headwind

Private markets turn down the volumereturns is not uncommon. Analysis by CEM 
Benchmarking, a leading institutional investor bench-
marking firm, suggests that private real estate 
returns lag public markets by as much as 12 months.

Net asset value
Total NAV of the funds included in the NFI-OE Index 
reached $376 billion at year-end, up 24 percent 
from $303 billion the year prior—the highest year-
over-year growth in the past decade. Over the long 
term, NAV has grown more modestly, increasing  
12 percent per year since 2017. 

Deal activity
Global real estate deal volume totaled $1.1 trillion,  
a 20 percent decline from a frenzied 2021 but still  
the second most active year on record. (Exhibit 26). 
Deal making in the first half remained robust, up  

25 percent over the first half of 2021, before 
faltering in the second half as interest rates 
increased, debt availability declined, and economic 
uncertainty grew. Second-half deal volume fell  
45 percent from the record second half of 2021. 
Deal volume was highest in the Americas at  
$698 billion, a 17 percent decline from the year 
before. Deal activity declined 19 percent to  
$118 billion in Asia–Pacific and 27 percent to  
$324 billion in Europe. 

Globally, deal activity declined across asset classes 
except hospitality, which remained flat (Exhibit 27). 
Along with hospitality, retail deal volume was 
relatively resilient, declining just 3 percent. Despite 
the year-over-year decline, retail deal volume  
in 2022, at $145 billion, was 4 percent higher than  
in 2019. After record deal volume in multifamily  
and industrial in 2021, volumes fell 29 and

19 percent year over year, respectively. The  
decline in multifamily deal activity was the sharpest  
among sectors.

US markets by sector
In the United States, multifamily deal volume 
declined by nearly a quarter in 2022, on the heels  
of record volume in 2021. Multifamily assets 
collectively produced a 7.1 percent return, driven by 
rent growth.9 New development as a proportion of 
existing inventory increased slightly, exceeding the 
5 percent mark for the first time in the past decade 
and indicating that developers are responding  
to strong demand for multifamily. Net absorption 
slowed considerably, dropping 81 percent— 
the largest one-year decline in absorption of the 

past decade across all sectors. However, despite 
lower absorption, the United States remains 
structurally short of three million to four million 
housing units (conservatively measured by  
Freddie Mac). More housing, particularly more 
affordable housing, is clearly needed.

In industrial, pandemic-driven shifts in shopping 
behavior (such as accelerated e-commerce) and 
supply chain arrangements (including onshoring) 
drove unprecedented demand for distribution and 
warehousing spaces in 2021, and investment dollars 
followed. However, deal volume totaled $144 billion, 
a 17 percent decline that followed a 65 percent 
increase in 2021. Development continued to be a 
focus in 2022: square footage under construction

Private markets turn down the volumeincreased 24 percent. Despite all that building, 
vacancy rates dropped to 3.3 percent, and rents 
grew 10 percent. Though deal activity dropped, 
industrial was the highest-performing major real 
estate sector, returning 14.6 percent.

Office showed some improvement but has not 
recovered to prepandemic levels. Office attendance 
across US cities remains depressed, ranging from  
41 percent in Philadelphia to 65 percent in Austin. 
Deal volume fell from record 2021 totals to the 
second-lowest total since 2014 (the lowest being  
in 2020). There were bright spots, however: net 
absorption turned positive after two negative years, 
and rent per square foot increased 1.6 percent.  
The only US sector with negative returns was office, 
which lost 3.4 percent for the year.

Retail real estate struggled mightily in the early days 
of the pandemic, but the picture has brightened. 
Deal volume in 2022 improved upon 2021 totals, 
rents reached a ten-year high, and occupancy levels 
improved. Retail vacancy at year-end 2022 was  
50 basis points lower than in 2019. Still, because of 
expanding cap rates, retail returns were relatively 
modest at 2.7 percent.

Already a multidecade headwind for retail real 
estate, the shift in retail spending to e-commerce 
accelerated massively in the early days of the 
pandemic. However, what was then believed to be 
several years’ worth of acceleration appears now  
to have been fleeting, as e-commerce penetration 
stagnated in 2022 (Exhibit 28). 

Further, US consumer spending grew 11 percent  
per year between 2020 and 2022, providing  
the retail sector with a much-needed tailwind. City-
level recovery has varied in line with population 
movement and relative office attendance. Compared 
with 2019 levels, Houston foot traffic is now  
15 percent higher, New York is roughly on par, and 
San Francisco, which was hit especially hard by 
pandemic-driven outmigration, has recovered to 
just 90 percent of the previous level. Even within 
cities, neighborhood-level foot traffic recovery 
varies substantially. Urban-core neighborhoods 
most reliant upon office (such as central business 
districts) have not recovered as robustly as  
those in less office-rich environments. When people 
go into the office less frequently, they spend less 
money near the office.

Private markets turn down the volumeSpotlight on US property technology
Property technology (proptech) interest ebbed in 
2022 in line with broader sentiment away from 
technology investments. Commercial proptech deal 
volume decreased to $12 billion from the 2021  
all-time high of $31 billion, which was bolstered by 
two large acquisitions. The combined residential  
and commercial proptech market’s deal volume 
decreased to a five-year low. That decline was 
driven predominantly by a lack of large transactions 
in 2022; deal count fell just 19 percent, compared 
with the 62 percent decline in total deal volume 
(Exhibit 30). 

Despite the slowdown in funding, demand 
fundamentals for the underlying technologies 
remain robust, as real estate is still an industry 
transitioning from traditional to digital. Those 
investing in the space include real estate dedicated 
venture capital and growth funds, traditional  
VCs, and buyout managers. Hundreds of privately 
held proptech companies at various life cycle 
stages will continue to need capital, and the 
number of firms interested in providing capital 
seems to be expanding. New entrants include  
real estate owners who have launched dedicated 
investment vehicles.

Private markets turn down the volumeReal estate—an inflation hedge
Institutional investors have allocated to real estate 
over time in part because of a long-held belief in the 
asset class’s ability to protect real value during 
periods of higher inflation. Real estate’s performance 
in the United States during all seven such periods of 
the last 40 years, including 2021 through 2022, 
confirms this belief.10 In five of the seven inflationary 
periods, real estate not only protected value, it 
outperformed gold, an asset believed to be a strong 
inflation hedge. In four of the seven periods, real 
estate outperformed equities and fixed income, 
which together make up the vast majority of most 
institutional portfolios. In fact, in five of seven 
periods, real estate outperformed its own 40-year 
average annualized performance.

The asset class is indeed a strong hedge against 
inflation, but perhaps not for the reasons most 
investors think. It is widely understood that 

commercial and multifamily rents tend to increase 
during inflationary periods, but annual increases 
seldom keep pace with inflation. However, a substan-
tial portion of inflation-sensitive operating costs 
(such as energy) are borne by tenants and thus do 
not impact NOI, particularly in commercial buildings. 
Higher materials and labor costs for new construc-
tion increase replacement costs, driving up the 
value of existing real estate. But the main reason 
real estate is a strong inflation hedge is counter-
intuitive: contracting cap rates.11 This result is 
surprising, as most periods of heighted inflation in 
the United States are coupled with rising interest 
rates, a reflection of the Federal Reserve’s main tool 
in combating inflation. Indeed, the spread between 
cap rates and treasuries compressed in three  
of the five past inflationary periods, suggesting that 
investor demand outpaced supply, perhaps due  
to the very belief in the asset class’s inflation-
hedging powers.

Private markets turn down the volume4

Private debt weathers 
the storm 

After more than a decade of rapid fundraising growth, strong macroeconomic headwinds 
slowed—but did not stop—private debt’s growth. In a year when other private classes fell back to 
earth somewhat, private debt set a new fundraising record, led by several megafund closes. 

The continued momentum in 2022 was understandable, as debt’s current yield and senior 
position in the capital stack have long made it a haven in volatile periods. The diversity of 
strategies within private debt also helps explain its consistent growth. As in 2020, when private 
debt was the only private asset class that recorded fundraising growth, investors’ ability to 
allocate to one or another strategy based on the prevailing market environment has contributed 
to consistent top-line growth through business cycles. In 2022, mezzanine strategies were  
most in favor, posting record fundraising totals and more than tripling 2021’s haul. Direct lending 
fundraising declined from 2021, but only marginally, raising over $100 billion for the second 
consecutive year. 

Private debt was not immune to the macroeconomic conditions last year, however. There was  
a notable drop in private debt deal volumes, driven by the slowdown in PE and only partially  
offset by market share gains taken from bank and syndicated financing channels. Performance 
also declined from 2021’s high as lower marks offset current yield gains.

44

Private markets turn down the volumeFundraising 
Global private debt fundraising rose to a new high  
of $224 billion, growing 2.1 percent year over year 
and marking a fifth consecutive annual increase 
(Exhibit 31). Annual fundraising in private debt has 
more than tripled since 2013, growing at an annual 
rate of 12 percent, the fastest growth among all 
private asset classes.

As was the case with other private asset classes, 
North America–focused fundraising grew  
11 percent, while fundraising in Europe and Asia 
declined 10 and 25 percent, respectively, in  
US dollar terms. The drivers of this geographic 
discrepancy are consistent with those covered 
elsewhere in this report: timing of funds coming  
to market (Europe’s largest-ever private debt  
fund was raised in 2021, for example), the strong  
US dollar, and macroeconomic and geopolitical 
concerns in Europe and Asia.

Fundraising for mezzanine lending increased  
2.4 times to $46 billion last year, reaching its highest 
total ever. A confluence of factors contributed to  
this rapid increase. First was simply the timing of 
fund closings: the mezzanine market includes  
four very large funds, three of which came to market 
last year. Those three funds raised more than  
$8 billion apiece. Collectively, their $32 billion haul 
accounted for more than 69 percent of the 
strategy’s total. Second, investors may perceive  
the strategy to be well positioned for this point  
in the credit cycle. As banks and direct lenders 
adopt more conservative risk postures, borrower 
demand for mezzanine financing (which until 
recently was dampened by cheap and abundant 
senior credit) may increase. Indeed, in percentage 
growth terms, mezzanine strategies have  
notched some of their best fundraising years—
2008, 2016, and 2022—during periods of  
rising risk premiums.

Private markets turn down the volumeFundraising for special situations strategies grew  
by 80% in 2022, while distressed fundraising 
declined precipitously on the heels of its two highest 
years ever. Distressed and special situations 
strategies have raised more than $200 billion in 
aggregate since the onset of the pandemic in  
2020. Opportunities to deploy these funds also have 
increased: after a benign 2021, the share of US 
loans pricing at distressed levels was 11 percent at 
the end of 2022, up from 2 percent at the beginning 
of the year. In Europe, the share of loans priced  
at distressed levels increased to 7 percent from  
less than 1 percent a year prior.12 

Fundraising for closed-end direct lending strategies 
totaled $114 billion in 2022, down 14 percent from 
the prior year. The slowdown in PE buyout activity 
(which is responsible for much of the demand for 
private loans) and wariness over rising default rates 
may have reduced investor appetite for the strategy. 
That said, 2022 was still the second-highest 

fundraising year for direct lending, which exceeded 
$100 billion in capital raising for the second 
consecutive year. Investors are increasingly rotating 
allocations from fixed-income securities into  
private loans due to their attractive current yield  
and privileged position in the capital structure. 
Furthermore, the floating-rate coupon of most 
direct loans has proved to be a major draw  
for investors seeking refuge from rising inflation  
and interest rate hikes. 

Across all private debt strategies, investors increased 
their commitments to larger and more-pedigreed 
debt funds. Eleven funds of $5 billion or more closed 
in 2022, accounting for 43 percent of private debt’s 
fundraising total. While this trend is consistent with 
fundraising for other private asset classes over the 
last year, private debt’s baseline was already one of 
relative concentration. Between 2017 and 2021,  
for example, 45 percent of the average annual private 
debt funding flowed to the 25 largest funds in  

2022 was the second-highest 
fundraising year for direct lending, 
which exceeded $100 billion  
in capital raising for the second 
consecutive year.

(Exhibit 32). Over the same period, the average 
private debt fund’s size across the United States and 
Europe nearly tripled to $1.6 billion.13 The asset  
class is characterized by lower returns and thinner 
margins than equity strategies, increasing the 
imperative for scale to drive profitability. Scale also 
breeds competitive advantage: lenders with deeper 
pockets are more capable of offering borrowers  
a variety of different financing solutions, providing 
liquidity on short notice, and holding larger positions 
without taking on undue concentration risk. This last 
advantage came into focus over the course of 2022, 
when direct lenders shied away from large single-
credit holds, which had been growing in popularity, 
and multi-lender deals returned to prominence.

AUM and deal activity
Private debt AUM totaled $1.3 trillion as of June 30, 
2022, up 12 percent from a year prior. North  
America remained the largest region, accounting  
for 62 percent of the total, roughly 2.3 times larger 
than Europe. Direct lending funds represented  
44 percent of the private debt market, up from  
32 percent in 2017, driving 55 percent of all AUM 
growth over the last five years.

Private markets turn down the volumeconsistent with other private markets asset classes. 
In United States middle-market sponsored direct 
lending, for example, deal volumes totaled  
$109 billion, 16 percent below 2021’s record total 
(Exhibit 33). The decline was largely caused by  
lower PE activity that reduced the need for debt 
financing in the sponsored market. Despite  
lower volumes overall, however, private lenders 
gained market share in 2022. As bank and 
syndicated financing channels dried up, particularly 
in the latter half of the year, private capital stepped 
into the void to finance PE transactions that were 
still being completed. Refinitiv estimates that direct 
lenders captured approximately 80 percent of the 
sponsored middle-market volumes in H2 2022. 

Performance
The pooled net IRR as of September 30 for private 
debt funds raised between 2000 and 2019 was  
0.2 percent, down more than 15 percentage points 

from 2021 and the lowest return posted by the asset 
class in more than a decade. The decline was largely 
the result of valuation markdowns driven by rising 
interest rates and increasing rates of stress and 
distress in liquid credit comparables. As public 
credit markets traded off over the course of the year, 
private managers marked down their holdings 
accordingly, including on loans expected to be held 
to maturity and paid off at par. 

The volatile market conditions were a boon to 
private credit performance in other ways, however. 
As discussed previously, most direct loans have 
floating-rate pricing, which means that quarterly 
coupon payments increase as interest rates rise. 
The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the 
most-used base rate, increased by more than  
400 basis points over the course of 2022.14 Also, 
spreads widened through the year, further 
increasing the expected yield of new loan issuances. 
The combination of these two factors drove yields

Private markets turn down the volumeon new middle-market unitranche loans to more 
than 12 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 
(Exhibit 34).

Over the long term, private debt has offered modest, 
low-volatility returns relative to other private asset 
classes. The 2009–19 vintages, for example, have 
generated a median net IRR of 9.3 percent, on  
par with infrastructure but lagging PE and real estate. 
However, variance in returns among funds, as 
measured by the interquartile spread, is less than 
half of real estate’s and a third of PE’s. 

Return profiles vary significantly across private  
debt strategies (Exhibit 35). Senior credit, 
predictably, has delivered both the lowest median 
returns (8 percent) and lowest dispersion, with a 
tight 3.9-percentage-point spread between the top 
and bottom quartiles. Distressed and mezzanine 
strategies have posted higher median returns with 
higher volatility, though mezzanine has outperformed 
distressed across all quartiles and with lower 
dispersion to boot. 

Private debt through the cycle 
Private debt has come of age in a historically benign 
macroeconomic environment. The 2010s were 
characterized by low interest rates, low unemploy-
ment, and steady economic growth. Coupled with 
post-GFC regulatory changes that forced banks to 
dramatically reduce their exposure to risky loans, 
market conditions could hardly have been more 
favorable for private debt managers to succeed. And 
succeed they have: private debt AUM has more  
than quintupled since 2009 (an annual growth rate 
of 14 percent), more than 500 new managers  
have entered the market, and performance has 
consistently exceeded public benchmarks. The 
growth of the asset class has both benefited from 
and enabled private equity’s concurrent rise,  
and private lenders have all but replaced banks in 
key segments of the sponsored middle market.

The first few years of the 2020s, by comparison, 
represent uncharted waters. A steep pandemic-
driven recession in 2020 proved to be short-lived, 
but the sharp recovery dissipated in 2022 as

slowing growth, entrenched inflation, rising interest 
rates, and weakness in certain high-growth sectors 
set in. Distress in the liquid credit markets is 
consequently trending upward, pressuring returns 
and, potentially, challenging the perception of direct 
lending as a low-risk asset class. Making matters 
worse, many of the factors that fueled private debt’s 
growth over the prior decade may have run their 
course. As mentioned above, there is little additional 
room for market share gains in the US middle 
market, where banks already have exited almost 
entirely. Interest rates available on fixed-income 
securities have risen, reducing the need for institu-
tional investors to rotate into higher-yielding credit 
securities to achieve performance objectives and 
stymieing refinancings. The multiyear upward  
march of PE valuation and leverage metrics has 
stalled, and earnings growth may come under 
pressure as well—all factors that may reduce the 
quantum of debt that backs a given asset base. 

Yet the through-cycle outlook for private debt 
remains rosy. Though PE deal activity declined in 
2022, PE buyout strategies are currently sitting  
on $1 trillion of dry powder that will drive new 
demand for private loans. Indeed, AUM housed in 
US direct lending strategies still represents an 
undersized portion of PE buyout AUM relative to 
average leveraged-buyout debt-to-capitalization 
ratios (Exhibit 36). Nearly $300 billion in loan 
maturities is coming due in the next three years, 
finally, a total approaching the entire amount of 
private credit dry powder.15 

The current market dislocation has further reduced 
banks’ tolerance for sub-investment-grade credit 
risk, opening the door for private lenders to take 
share in new segments of the credit market, including 
for larger borrowers, new assets (such as infra-
structure), and additional geographies. This 
progression accelerated in 2022 as banks became

less willing to lend. Private lenders financed 
approximately 30 deals of $1 billion or more in 2022, 
up from fewer than five in 2019, demonstrating  
their increasing relevance to larger borrowers that 
would have traditionally sought financing in the 
broadly syndicated or high-yield markets.16 The 
oppor tunity in new markets is sizable. Indeed, despite 
its rapid growth over the prior decade, private debt 
is still the smallest segment of the broader credit 
landscape, representing less than 5 percent of total 
US credit assets by most estimates.17 

Finally, as the private credit market continues to 
mature, other private asset classes provide a road 
map for additional growth opportunities. One 

example is secondaries funds that, while already an 
established strategy in private equity, remain 
nascent in private credit. In 2022, falling public 
markets valuations and the denominator effect 
prompted LPs to seek liquidity for a record number 
of private credit holdings, with estimated transaction 
volume of $17 billion, nearly ten times 2017’s volume. 
The market remains undercapitalized, with more  
LPs seeking to offload positions than buyers to 
purchase them, but in the last two years, several 
dedicated credit secondaries funds have been 
launched to meet the rising demand.18

Infrastructure and natural 
resources grow and evolve

Infrastructure and natural resources (NR) overcame broader market headwinds in 2022 to set a 
new fundraising record of $158 billion. Investors flocked to the asset class because of its ability 
to provide stable cashflows, less correlated returns, and a hedge against inflation. On the supply 
side, the closing of a record number of global megafunds boosted fundraising. AUM grew as  
well, reaching a new high of $1.3 trillion, 14.2 percent higher than in 2021.

Like other asset classes, infrastructure and NR strategies were affected by macroeconomic 
challenges. Deal volumes declined 27 percent as financing became more expensive and harder 
to access. And while infrastructure and NR fund performance declined somewhat from 2021, 
these funds were the top-performing private markets asset classes in 2022. NR outperformed 
all others, returning 15.6 percent in a second consecutive year of strong performance driven  
by rising commodity prices. 

Beneath these headline statistics, revolutions in energy, mobility, and digitization are changing 
the face of infrastructure investing. The flow of capital into the asset class has pushed investors 
to look beyond traditional core infrastructure assets. Core-plus and value-add strategies are 
now investing in new asset categories and infrastructure service providers as GPs seek to 
accommodate the return expectations of a new class of infrastructure investor. While the long-
term demand for capital is tremendous, with a projected global infrastructure spending gap  
of $15 trillion through 2030,19 current macroeconomic and geopolitical events are creating short-
term pressure on high-growth sectors such as telecommunications and renewables.

Private markets turn down the volumeto $8 billion, while Europe-focused fundraising 
declined 31 percent to $53 billion. Some of the 
discrepancy in fundraising growth between North 
America and Europe may represent a true shift  
of investors’ regional preferences over the past year. 
But much of it may be idiosyncratic. The infrastructure 
and NR asset class is increasingly characterized by 
large funds (the average fund size reached $1.6 billion 
last year), so it is particularly susceptible to the 
timing of which funds are in market in a given year. 
Also, many of the megafunds that closed in North 
America last year have a global mandate and are 
likely to deploy some portion of their capital in 
Europe and Asia, so the single-year dispersion in 
fundraising by region may be overstated.

Fundraising for core-plus infrastructure and NR 
vehicles grew by 68 percent, retaking its place as the 
largest strategy, after two years of depressed 
fundraising (Exhibit 38). Fundraising for the strategy 

has grown at an annual rate of 11.4 percent over  
the past decade, driven by investors’ willingness to 
take on equity risk and move up the risk curve in  
a hunt for yield as traditional infrastructure returns 
compressed. To accommodate this evolving investor 
profile, the definition of infrastructure investment 
has now expanded to include a range of higher risk-
and-return opportunities beyond traditional core 
opportunities, including operating companies or 
early-stage technology ventures, as well as assets 
such as data centers, modular healthcare units,  
and airport security systems. 

Meanwhile, growth in other strategies was muted. 
Core fundraising was roughly flat, while debt and 
opportunistic strategies declined for the second year 
in a row. Opportunistic strategies in particular  
have fallen out of investor favor, with 2022 totals 
down more than 87 percent since the strategy’s 
peak in 2017. The shift to large fund vehicles

Private markets turn down the volumeobserved across private markets, including 
infrastructure, potentially contributed to opportu-
nistic fundraising’s decline. Smaller funds make  
up a greater share of opportunistic strategies, with 
44 percent of dollars committed since 2006 to 
vehicles of less than $1 billion, versus 31 percent for 
other strategies. Most large funds execute a  
core-plus strategy. 

A notable highlight last year was the extraordinary 
growth in infrastructure megafunds: five funds 
exceeding $10 billion in size closed in 2022. In total, 
these funds raised $75 billion, accounting for  

47 percent of total fundraising in the asset class 
(Exhibit 39), a new high for concentration within the 
asset class. The previous high for megafund 
fundraising came in 2019, when $10 billion–plus 
funds cumulatively contributed 16 percent to  
the annual total. This shift is consistent with returns. 
Funds larger than $5 billion have outperformed,  
with lower dispersion. For all such funds raised 
between 2000 and 2019, the median net IRR through 
September 30 stands at 12.0 percent; in contrast, 
funds between $1 billion and $5 billion returned  
9.8 percent, and funds less than $1 billion returned 
8.2 percent.20

Private markets turn down the volumeInfrastructure megafunds accounted  
for 47 percent of total fundraising, 
setting a new high for concentration 
within the asset class. 

AUM 
Infrastructure and NR’s global AUM grew by  
14 percent to $1.3 trillion as of the first half of 2022. 
Over the last five years, AUM has grown 14 percent 
per year. AUM is concentrated in the United States 
and Europe, which collectively represented  
81 percent of the global total. Europe’s 20 percent 
annual AUM growth over the last five years is the 
fastest among all regions. Growth in North America 
AUM has slowed, causing its share of the global  
total to fall to 50 percent in 2022, from 60 percent  
in 2012. This regional shift in AUM is more indicative 
of the growth of infrastructure investments in 
Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world regions than 
a slowdown in North America; indeed, all four 
regions grew more than 12 percent per year over  
the past decade. 

Performance
Compared with the dramatic decline in performance 
in some other private markets asset classes,  
returns posted by infrastructure funds declined  
only modestly last year. The pooled-net IRR  
for the first three quarters of 2022 was 8.7 percent, 
down from 14.6 percent in 2021. Over the longer 
term, the 9.3 percent median-net IRR for vintage 
2009–19 infrastructure funds is just below that  
for real estate (11.5 percent) and on par with the IRR 
for private debt (9.3 percent). 

NR funds posted strong performance for the second 
straight year. Buoyed by energy price inflation, NR 
funds produced a pooled net IRR of 15.6 percent  
in the first three quarters of 2022, after returning 
30.3 percent in 2021. However, the long-term 
performance of natural resources remains muted. 
The 6.5 percent median net IRR for vintage  
2009–19 NR funds is the lowest among all the 
private markets asset classes. The asset class’s 
muted returns are a result of the long period  
of depressed conventional energy prices between 
2013 and 2020. 

Infrastructure’s evolving composition
Infrastructure’s mandate has evolved over time in 
response to prevailing macro trends. Growing 
efforts to decarbonize the economy, along with 
proliferating ESG commitments and substantial 
competition for traditional brownfield infrastructure 
investments, have attracted a larger share of 
infrastructure dollars to alternative energy and 
clean-tech assets. The deal activity for alternative 
energy infrastructure equaled 26 percent of the 
total in 2022, up from 7 percent in 2005 (Exhibit 40). 
The US Inflation Reduction Act and the energy 
infrastructure investment it requires provided a jolt 
to infrastructure in 2022. However, this longer-term 
trend away from conventional energy investment 
paused in 2022, when a confluence of factors

drove the prices of conventional energy-related 
commodities sharply higher.

Similarly, the “digitization of everything” has 
increased investment in telecommunications infra-
structure in recent years. Deal volume in the 
communications sector accounted for 30 percent  
of infrastructure deal volume in 2022, up from  
less than 17 percent in 2007.

Energy
The transition from conventional hydrocarbon 
energy sources to renewable sources such as wind 
and solar has become a global priority. The shift 

involves policy changes, such as last year’s US 
Inflation Reduction Act, and societal preferences, 
such as the growing popularity of electric vehicles 
and residential solar installations. 

Private markets investing mirrors the trend, wherein 
LPs and GPs have gradually shifted their focus away 
from conventional energy toward renewable 
alternatives. In 2014, 47 percent of the private energy 
funds closed had conventional energy mandates, 
while 40 percent focused on renewables. By 2021, 
the landscape changed dramatically, with conven-
tional energy funds representing only 14 percent 
and renewables comprising 69 percent. 

57

Private markets turn down the volumeThe 2021–22 spike in energy prices forced investors 
and allocators to adapt. Conventional energy’s share 
of funds raised increased to 28 percent, perhaps 
because investors were seeking to capitalize on what 
in 2021 was the strongest performance posted  
by NR strategies in more than a decade. Renewables 
fundraising, meanwhile, declined precipitously  
to its lowest total since 2014 (Exhibit 41). Though the 
reversal of the long-term trend was stark, most 

market participants view it as transitory. In some 
ways, in fact, more expensive (and less reliable) 
conventional energy sources increase the demand 
for renewable generation. According to a recent 
Preqin survey, 100 percent of infrastructure fund 
managers predict the energy transition will be  
a primary driver of the asset class over the next  
ten years.

Private markets advance 
their ESG agendas 

More private markets managers are incorporating considerations for ESG factors into their 
corporate policies, operating procedures, and investment decisions. In 2022, 1,069 more 
investors committed to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI),21 and a 
further 88 asset owners became PRI signatories, bringing the total to 681.22 The proportion of  
total private capital fundraising that came from managers with an investment policy that includes 
ESG issues rose to 66 percent in 2022,23 a new high. 

This progress is a result of many factors. First and foremost, the evidence supporting a positive 
correlation between ESG and financial performance continues to mount, as long as the 
underlying company is healthy. For example, recent McKinsey research found that publicly 
traded ESG outperformers that also outperformed peers on margin and growth delivered  
200 basis points in excess return to their shareholders over companies that only outperformed

Private markets turn down the volumefinancially.24 New government policies that provide incentives for certain ESG investments—most 
notably the US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022—are likely to strengthen this correlation further. 
Second, LPs are increasingly incorporating ESG metrics into their capital allocation processes. 
One recent survey indicates that nearly three-quarters of LPs would consider eliminating  
a manager from consideration if it was unable to provide acceptable standards of ESG-related 
disclosures.25 Finally, macroeconomic forces, including higher energy prices and geopolitical 
conflict, have strengthened long-term investor interest in alternative energy sources and overall 
energy independence.

Consideration of ESG is not limited to fundraising and deal activity. Across the entire investment 
life cycle, from fundraising and asset selection to value creation and exit planning, ESG is on  
the minds of investors. Across our clients, we see ESG becoming a competitive differentiator and 
driver of returns. A pre-investment ESG diligence includes a materiality scan, ESG performance 
and benchmark, value-at-stake analytics, and an ESG maturity assessment. 

After making an investment, GPs have five value creation levers they can pull to improve  
their portfolio: 

1.  Top-line growth. Attract B2B and B2C customers with more sustainable products and achieve 

better access to resources through stronger community and government relations.

2.  Cost reduction. Lower energy consumption and reduce water intake.

3.  Regulatory and legal interventions. Achieve greater strategic freedom through deregulation 

and earn subsidies and government support.

4.  Productivity uplift. Boost employee motivation, and attract talent through greater  

social credibility.

5.  Investment and asset optimization. Enhance investment returns by better allocating capital 

for the long term, and avoid investments that may not pay off because of longer-term 
environmental issues.

ESG metrics improved over time.

Private markets turn down the volumeE: Sustainable investing 
goes mainstream
The E in ESG has come into sharper focus in recent 
years, with GPs employing a range of strategies  
to accelerate and capitalize on the ongoing energy 
transition. Perhaps the most visible strategy is the 
so-called impact funds, which typically include an 
explicit ESG agenda as part of their investment 
strategy. Fundraising for these vehicles continued 
its upward climb last year, with first-half fundraising 
nearly eclipsing the full-year 2021 total of $28 billion, 
which was itself a record. The size of impact funds  
is rapidly growing with the maturation of the strategy: 
Of the 13 total impact funds of over $2 billion in size, 
nine have closed in the last two years.

ESG AUM exceeded $100 billion for the first time  
in 2022. AUM for the strategy grew at 35 percent 
per year over the last decade, far outpacing the rate 
of AUM growth in the broader private markets 

(Exhibit 42). It is also important to note that this 
measure of ESG AUM dramatically understates 
ESG’s relative importance within the broader  
$10 trillion–plus private markets landscape. Hundreds 
of billions of dollars in private investments that  
are focused on the energy transition or otherwise 
aligned to a sustainability-driven investment thesis 
sit outside these dedicated impact funds, though 
data transparency and measurability for this capital 
is currently limited—a common problem within 
private markets ESG.

Sustainable investments, whether deployed from 
impact funds or through broader vehicles, can take a 
variety of different forms (see the following section,  
 “Accelerating the energy transition”). According to 
research from McKinsey’s Sustainability Practice, 
deal volume in global climate technology bucked the 
broader market trend last year by growing 7 percent 
year over year to set a record of nearly $200 billion

Private markets turn down the volume(Exhibit 43). Approximately 40 percent of that total 
was deployed in venture capital strategies, high-
lighting the importance of private investing in the 
development of new climate technologies. Five 
minority investments last year went to businesses 
valued at over $5 billion apiece. Two of these 
focused on renewable power generation, and one 
each focused on transport electrification, water,  
and building equipment. 

The power sector was the primary target for 
sustainable investments in 2022 for the third year 
running, accounting for just over half of all deal 
activity. Investments targeting power generation 
have been most common in recent years. The 
transportation sector, including investments in EV 
manufacturing and EV-charging infrastructure, ran 
a distant second at 14 percent of deal volume.

packaging, sustainable textiles, green steel 
production, and carbon-neutral fuel. 

Accelerating the energy transition
As we discussed in last year’s report, GPs seeking  
to invest in the sustainability transition can employ  
a range of strategies:

 — Brown-to-green strategies focus on trans-
forming “dirty” business models to be more 
environmentally friendly, typically by refocusing 
product, technology, or service offerings. For 
example, refineries can be retrofitted to ethanol 
plants, and offshore services businesses can 
pivot away from offshore oil and gas and toward 
offshore wind. These strategies are often 
pursued via a structure in which the “brown” 
asset is placed in an off-balance-sheet vehicle 
into which an investor contributes capital that  
is used to fund the green transition. 

 — Supply chain decarbonization consists of 

investing in companies that provide critical inputs 
in the decarbonization value chain—for example, 
companies that supply businesses with 
advanced materials, components, or equipment 
required for decarbonization.

 — Green growth consists of creating new green 
products. Examples include recyclable plastic 

 — Enabling technology focuses on emissions 
measurement, accounting, and mitigation 
support to help emitting companies manage and 
abate their carbon footprints. Examples include 
emissions accreditation and trading platforms, 
as well as ESG/HSEQ6526 software.

 — Investing in winners involves scaling businesses 

that already have proprietary or leading 
decarbon i zation technology or capabilities. 
Potential targets could include manufacturers of 
EV components (including batteries) or low-
carbon agriculture products.

Most investors today recognize the importance  
of sustainability. To capture full value from  
the sustainability transition, investors will need to 
deepen their insights into green technologies, 
regulations, and market demand.

S: Private markets strive for greater 
gender and ethnic diversity
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) have together 
become an important part of the fundraising,  
hiring, and investing landscape for private markets 
participants. To cite just one salient example, LPs 
report a willingness to allocate twice as much capital 

The percentage of PE firms that report 
internal diversity statistics during the 
fundraising process has risen steadily 
since 2014 and exceeded 50 percent for 
the first time in 2020 and 2021.

26 HSEQ = health, safety, environment, and quality.

Private markets turn down the volumeto a gender-diverse deal team and nearly three 
times more capital to an ethnically or racially diverse 
deal team, all else being equal.27 GPs are taking 
notice: the percentage of PE firms that report 
internal diversity statistics during the fundraising 
process has risen steadily since 2014 and exceeded 
50 percent for the first time in 2020 and 2021 
(Exhibit 44). 

While DEI has become increasingly important to 
GPs and LPs alike, a gap remains in representation 
for women and ethnic and racial minorities across 
PE and other alternative investing firms. In entry-
level investing roles across the US and Canada, 
represen tation of women is at 36 percent, and 
representation of ethnic/racial minorities is  
at 39 percent. At each succeeding level of seniority, 
representation drops. While a similar phenomenon 
occurs outside of private investment firms, PE 
representation nevertheless lags corporate America 
across all senior levels. 

In 2022, McKinsey surveyed 400,000 employees at 
more than 300 organizations for the annual Women 
in the Workplace report, as well as 42 global private 
markets firms that collectively employ more than 
60,000 people for the annual State of Diversity in 
Global Private Markets report.28 Together, the two 
research efforts offer insight into the representation 
of women and ethnic and racial minorities in private 
investing. In the rest of this chapter, we discuss 
where the numbers stand and conclude with 
thoughts on how firms can bring a more diverse set 
of perspectives to the table.

Representation of women across private markets
In North America PE, women make up nearly half of 
all entry-level positions, but their share drops as 
seniority rises, with women filling less than a third of 
positions at the principal level and above. While the 
drop is partially caused by a historically imbalanced 
talent pipeline (fewer women filling entry-level roles

of promotion. 

At the entry level, female representation in PE is now 
similar to that of corporate America (Exhibit 45). 
However, at the managing director level, corporate 
America is six percentage points higher than PE. In 
the C-suite, the gap widens further to 11 percentage 
points. As the pipeline for the next generation of 
women leaders grows, hiring will continue to be an 
important lever for (eventually) increasing senior 
representation. However, work is needed to reach 
parity in promotion rates.

Throughout the global PE industry, women more 
often fill non-investing roles than investing roles 
(Exhibit 46). In entry-level positions globally, women 
make up 57 percent of non-investing roles but just 
34 percent of investing roles. Representation falls 
more steeply across seniority levels in investing 

roles as well. The percentage of women in investing 
roles drops 22 points from entry level to managing 
director, compared with an 18-point drop for  
non-investing roles. The sharpest drop for both 
investing and non-investing roles occurs at  
the level of principal. 

Private markets firms can improve representation of 
women through three principal levers: external 
hiring, internal promotions, and attrition.29 Lateral 
hiring can be an expedient tool for increasing 
representation at later stages of the PE pipeline. On 
average, in 2021, 31 percent of non-entry-level 
investing-track hires into US and Canada PE firms 
were women. This figure is 35 percent at the  
vice president level and dips to 22 percent for the 
director/principal level and 18 percent for the 
managing director/partner level. These rates are 
slightly higher than current representation levels  
at each seniority tier, indicating that lateral hiring is

helping to reduce the representation gap, albeit 
modestly. None of these statistics suggest parity.

Addressing differences in promotion and attrition 
rates between genders can help address senior 
representation over time. Promotion rate differences 
between men and women early in the funnel can 
result in a “broken rung,” that is, a gap in share at the 
next level of seniority greater than 5 percent. In 
Americas PE, women in 2021 were promoted from 
entry level to associate at roughly the same rate  

as men; however, there is a gap in promotion  
parity in more senior roles, with women promoted  
at a lower rate. 

Attrition rates also vary by gender. In prior years, 
men were leaving their employers at higher rates 
than women, but our research shows a different 
pattern. In 2021, women left their firms at higher 
rates than their male colleagues at almost every 
level. On average, the attrition rate was 17 percent 
for women, versus 12 percent for men.

Private markets turn down the volumeEthnic and racial representation across the 
private markets
For racial and ethnic minorities, representation 
varies both between and within seniority levels by 
group. As with women, the share of racial and  
ethnic minorities drops as seniority levels climb, with 
the most precipitous drop at the principal level 
(Exhibit 47). Along with representation, attrition and 
hiring also vary by group.

Within US and Canadian PE firms, White 
professionals hold 70 percent of all investing roles. 
Asian professionals represent the largest racial 
minority group, while Hispanic and Black profes-
sionals hold only 4 percent and 3 percent of  
all investing roles, respectively. Racial and ethnic 
minorities are also less well represented on 
investment committees than in the ranks of 
managing directors—9 percent versus 17 percent 
(Exhibit 48). As with women, there is a significant 
gap in representation at the senior level versus  
the junior level. 

As mentioned earlier, our study examined three  
key levers that have an impact on representation: 
external hiring, internal promotions, and attrition. 
Hiring has a net positive effect on representation of 
ethnic and racial minorities. However, the effect 
differs by seniority: hiring has an accretive effect for 
junior roles and a negative effect for senior roles. 
Promotion rates vary by ethnic and racial group. 
White and Asian professionals are promoted more 
frequently across all seniority levels, while Black and 
Hispanic professionals experience lower promotion 
rates on average, particularly at senior levels. Attrition 
rates also vary by ethnic and racial group. Asian  
and Hispanic professionals experience the highest 
attrition rates of all ethnic and racial groups.

The path forward 
The landscape around DEI in private markets is 
changing in no small part due to the push from  
LPs to share data during fundraising. However, GPs’ 
methods of calculating and reporting DEI vary 
considerably, as do the expectations and definitions

Private markets turn down the volumeof DEI held by LPs. In coming years, this variation 
may change. LPs, GPs, and the broader stakeholder 
community need apples-to-apples metrics to 
compare DEI initiatives. Tracking and metric consis-
tency also will help firms get better at measuring 
their progress. 

To make progress, of course, firms need to act. To 
close the representation gap of women and  
racial and ethnic minorities at senior levels, firms  
can implement several practices:

1. 

Increase transparency with clear metrics and 
tracking capabilities. Firms can appoint 
champions to lead the creation and tracking of 
diversity metrics and assure granularity of data, 
particularly for intersectional groups. 

2.  Diversify recruitment and hiring. Firms can 

improve their hiring processes by increasing 
transparency and focusing on the desired  
skills and capabilities for each position in the 
investing landscape. Additionally, they can 
expand hiring reach by looking at talent pools 
from universities, backgrounds, and geographies 
they have not previously considered. 

3.  Debias the promotion processes. Better 

transparency about what is required for success 
in each role would foster a more equitable 
promotion process with clearly pinpointed 
objectives for advancement. Formal sponsorship 
and mentorship programs specifically for  
women and ethnic and racial minorities also can 
improve visibility in promotion processes. 

4.  Reduce attrition. Firms can improve retention  
by fostering an equitable and inclusive culture. 
Initiatives like employee resource groups, 
generous leave policies, and child care subsidies 
are some potential tools for creating a more 
inclusive environment. Flexible locating  
and remote work are initiatives especially  
valued by women.

Only time will tell if LP pressure on GPs will be 
enough of a catalyst to change the face of private 
markets. As DEI increases in importance within 
private markets, we request your help to participate

Private Markets study. Please sign up here.
