Executive summary

The approaching end of a decade-long run of growth fueled by market performance and net interest 
income, though somewhat expected, will be a rude awakening for US wealth managers. Over the past 
ten years, through the emergence of new models, shifting client preferences, and operational ups and 
downs, firms grew used to—in some cases, reliant upon—market-driven growth in assets. Assuming 
that the tailwind is waning, at least for a time, it will soon become apparent which firms remained 
operationally sharp during the good times and which overrelied on external forces.

Equity and bond markets suffered simultaneous declines in 2022, with the S&P 500 down nearly  
20 percent and the US aggregate bond index experiencing the worst year of performance since 
inception. This market downturn, unmatched since the financial crisis of 2008, erased close to  
50 percent of the cumulative market appreciation from the preceding five years. However, the swiftest 
escalation in interest rates in over half a century took the sting out of this market decline: even 
compared against 2021’s record (market-driven) growth, US wealth managers achieved strong results 
in 2022. Revenues and profits rose by 6 and 8 percent, respectively, resulting in a one-percentage-
point increase in overall profit margins.

Performance in the first three quarters of 2023 has remained positive, albeit not as strong as in 2022. 
Interest rates increased by a further 100 basis points, and equity markets briefly achieved full recovery 
before sliding again—the S&P 500 was up 9 percent at the end of the third quarter, compared with  
20 percent at the peak. From wealth managers’ perspective, 2022 may have represented a transitional 
year in which a historically sudden surge of inflation was offset by rising interest rates. And 2023 may 
be the beginning of a period during which the industry’s resilience is tested more thoroughly as the 
softening action of high interest rates gradually fades. 

Grappling with shifts in the macro environment is already a stiff challenge for US wealth managers, but 
another long-brewing trend is close to becoming a permanent feature of the industry landscape. The 
industry has long been organized along distinct lines in terms of delivery models and client segments. 
This structure has been gradually loosening, as wealth delivery models of all kinds expand beyond 
their old borders, shaking off traditional limitations on what services they offer clients and advisers 
and which clients and advisers they serve. Technology is accelerating this transition. And whether 
wealth management firms have a large in-house technology function, rely largely on WealthTech 
vendors, or operate somewhere in between, most are now as reliant on technology as they are on 
people. Technology’s importance will deepen as generative AI demonstrates its enormous potential for 
boosting productivity, improving client experience, and supporting growth. Some firms have already 
announced initiatives to equip their advisers with tools that rapidly synthesize insights they can use in 
real time with clients, while others are exploring use cases that leverage gen AI for content creation 
and A/B testing to significantly improve prospect engagement.

As convergence in the US wealth management industry accelerates, competition will intensify. This 
situation calls on individual firms to carefully consider which big bets they can make now to stay 
relevant to their clients and advisers under the new competitive paradigm. Many will determine 
that they need new recipes for growth. Strategic clues come from the practices of top performers, 
which reaped disproportionate rewards in 2022. The fastest-growing firms tend to have access

to proprietary lead generation channels (for example, workplace), have expanded their offerings 
(adding banking in particular), offer superior multi-segment adviser value propositions, have scalable 
infrastructure, and make disciplined M&A choices. These markers transcend legacy lines between the 
delivery models. 

Firms that benefited from rising interest rates have a unique opportunity to reinvest into the business for 
the future, while the rest will need to make tougher choices and free up capacity that can be redeployed 
toward long-term growth. As we detail later in this report, firms can position themselves for the new 
dynamics at play by focusing on six areas: expanding offerings, building centralized lead generation 
capabilities, developing a talent attraction strategy, leveraging gen AI for adviser and other client-facing 
staff productivity, reallocating resources, and redesigning their operating models for scalability and 
flexibility.

Title of literature The good, the bad, and the rest:  
An economic overview

After a decade of nearly unbroken growth 
driven by market appreciation, the US wealth 
management industry experienced a significant 
contraction in 2022 (Exhibit 1). Client assets 
overseen by the industry declined by  
$6.2 trillion, erasing almost a year and a half 
of market appreciation. Market performance 
accounted for $7.6 trillion of the decline and was 
offset slightly by $1.4 trillion of net inflows  
(2.8 percent organic growth). This compares with 
6.2 percent organic growth in 2021 ($2.6 trillion), 
which was bolstered by favorable economic 
conditions and federal stimulus money. 

The saving graces were interest rate hikes, which 
enabled the industry to fare relatively well despite 

major headwinds. Over the course of 2022, the 
Federal Reserve increased the federal funds 
rate by a total of 425 basis points to the highest 
level since 2008. Wealth management revenues, 
profits, and profit margins continued on their 
growth trajectories, increasing 6 percent, 
 8 percent, and one percentage point, respectively 
in 2022, further validating the industry’s resilience 
and attractive fundamentals. Beneath the positive 
headline performance was significant variance 
in results between individual firms, strongly 
correlated with each firm’s ability to extract 
bottom-line impact from rising interest rates. 
For winners, this created a unique opportunity 
to secure additional financial capacity they can 
reinvest in the business.

Asset growth concentrated at the  
top, again
In 2022, industry net flows decreased by 
 3.4 percentage points to an average of  
2.8 percent (below the ten-year average of  
3.8 percent between 2012 and 2021). The trend 
of wide disparity in performance across delivery 
models—as well as between firms and advisers—
continued. As is often the case, the benefits of 
growth settled at the top of the industry. 

In the years leading up to 2022, organic growth 
disproportionately accrued to digital-direct 
wealth managers (sometimes referred to as 
online brokerages) and registered investment 
advisers (RIAs). RIAs, despite seeing their 
net flows approximately halve, recorded the 
highest net flows of any channel, at 5 percent in 
2022 (Exhibit 2). They outpaced digital-direct 
firms, which experienced more muted growth: 
net flows declined by almost four percentage 

points to a total of 3 percent—slightly above 
the average for the industry and well below the 
2017–21 average of 6.5 percent. Digital-direct 
firms faced two challenging factors. First, 2021’s 
record-high levels of new account openings were 
unsustainable, as they resulted in large part from 
a confluence of favorable market conditions, 
social-media-driven uptake of trading (so-called 
meme stocks), and the stimulus money 
distributed to households. In fact, based on our 
analysis of public filings, the growth in number of 
self-directed accounts overall declined sharply to 
7 percent, compared with 27 percent year-over-
year growth in 2021. Second, a flight to advice 
is common in economic downturns and periods 
of increased volatility. According to McKinsey’s 
2023 Affluent and High-Net-Worth Consumer 
Insights Survey, among clients who have both a 
self-directed account and a traditional adviser, 
58 percent actively reallocated assets to their 
adviser in 2022.

Two other delivery models achieved above-
industry net flows: independent broker–dealers 
and national/regional broker–dealers, at 3.5 
percent each, both buoyed by the continued 
movement of advisers to their models. Finally, 
wirehouses and private banks continued to 
underperform other delivery models (reporting net 
flows of 1 and 0.5 percent, respectively) in terms 
of industry average and their share of total client 
assets. At wirehouses, the underperformance 
was partly an outcome of productive advisers’ 
continued migration to independent channels.  

As in previous years, asset growth was 
concentrated among the top performers. The 
three fastest-growing wealth managers in 
absolute terms in 2022 represented one-fifth of 
total industry assets but one-third of net flows.  
A similar dynamic was at play within each delivery 
model: the fastest-growing independent broker–
dealer accounted for 50 percent of net flows for 
the model category (versus 33 percent of assets); 
the fastest-growing national full-service firm 
accounted for 70 percent of net flows (versus 37 
percent of assets); and the top-performing private 
bank represented the lion’s share of the channel’s 

growth. And a new McKinsey survey of leading 
RIAs with more than $10 billion in assets suggests 
that the difference in net flows between top and 
bottom quartiles is about seven percentage points. 

A similar clustering of asset growth holds true 
at the adviser level, although the gap between 
top performers and the rest narrowed relative to 
2021. The top quartile of advisers outperformed 
the second-highest quartile by two times in 2022 
(down from 2.5 times) and the bottom quartile by 
a factor of ten (down from 12 times). Within the 
top quartile, the top decile outperformed the next 
tier by a factor of 2 (adding 26.8 and 13.5 new 
households per year, respectively). 

Positive operating leverage again, 
against the odds
Industry profit pools increased for the ninth time in 
ten years, growing 8 percent to reach an all-time 
high of $65 billion. But 2022 was a slowdown 
compared with the 30 percent profit growth 
registered in 2021. Total revenues for the US 
wealth management industry grew 6 percent to 
$255 billion (Exhibit 3), and costs increased

4 percent to $190 billion (Exhibit 4). This positive 
operating leverage enabled the industry to expand 
its overall pretax margins to 26 percent (a one-
percentage-point increase year over year). While 
this was the second straight year of positive 
operating leverage after five years of flat margins 
(Exhibit 5), the dynamics in 2022 were markedly 
different from those in 2021. In 2021, positive 
operating leverage resulted from a combination 
of record net flows and near-record market 
appreciation; in 2022, rising interest rates fueled 
high-margin net interest income revenue streams. 

On the revenue side, revenue streams related 
to net interest income accounted for over 100 
percent of industry-wide revenue growth in 
2022, more than offsetting a decline in revenue 
streams tied to asset levels. These dynamics 
were observed across almost all delivery models, 
notwithstanding significant variation in the details 
between models. The notable exception is RIAs, 
which were challenged by the worsenening macro 
environment and virtually no exposure to interest 
rates. They did, however, continue to see strong 
organic asset growth, driven in large part by

revenues due to rising rates mostly benefited wealth 
management firms (rather than the advisers)—hence 
the overall increase in profit margins.

Cost growth in 2022 slowed, growing at 5 percent 
versus the 7 percent average growth between 2016 
and 2021 (and 14 percent growth in 2021), primarily 
due to the slower growth of client sales and service 
team costs, which represent two-thirds of total 
industry costs. In 2022, these costs grew only 
3 percent, compared with the 9 percent per annum 
growth between 2016 and 2021. Client sales and 
service team compensation costs are largely tied to 
compensable advisory and brokerage revenues, which 
in fact decreased by 1 percent in 2022. In contrast 
to most years over the past decade, the growth in 

Given healthy revenue growth, the wealth 
management industry continued to invest in growth 
and infrastructure, as evidenced by the more 
significant cost increases in technology, middle- and 
back-office operations, marketing, and other support 
functions. Combined, these cost categories grew an 
average of 9 percent, versus the 4 percent per annum 
average for 2016–21. While managers took a long-
term through-cycle view and continued to invest in 
future growth and scalable infrastructure, interest 
rate hikes are unlikely to be sustained at the same

level for the long term, which would inevitably 
exhaust this source of high-margin revenue growth. 
Moreover, a decline in rates (compared with 2023’s 
historical highs) would be a significant headwind. 
Therefore, wealth managers should seriously 
consider continued investments in the business 
now, while conditions are favorable, to future-proof 
their business and operating models for tougher 
times ahead. 

2023: End of the easy ride?
In 2023, the macroeconomic environment has 
shifted again, with a mixed impact on the industry. 
Our analysis of the performance of public wealth 
management firms in the first three quarters of 
2023 (on an annualized basis) suggests client 
assets have partially rebounded, growing by 
8 percent compared with a 12 percent decline in 
2022, whereas revenue growth has slowed from 
7 percent to 4 percent (Exhibit 6).1 In other words,

the pendulum has swung back, with revenue 
drivers partially reversing from 2022: by mid-2023, 
public markets had almost recovered to peak 
2021 levels (before sliding again), though due to 
the lagging nature of revenues versus assets, the 
impact of the recovered asset levels has only been 
fully realized in the third quarter thus far. At the 
same time, for all but the independent and regional 
broker–dealers, growth in net interest income 
cooled because rate increases were smaller than 
in 2022 and advisers and clients allocated away 
from relatively low-yielding bank deposits to 
higher-yielding offerings like CDs, treasury notes, 
and money market funds. At the same time, profit 
margins have decreased from 27 percent to  
26 percent, primarily because of slower revenue 
growth. 

While the overall picture in the first three quarters 
of 2023 has been largely favorable to wealth 
managers, dynamics differ across delivery models.  

 — Wirehouses reported 8 percent growth in client 
assets due to strong market performance, and 
revenues increased 1 percent, compared with 
a 4 percent increase in 2022. In fact, only one 
of the four wirehouses experienced positive 
revenue growth; the remaining three  
reported an average decline in revenues of  
2 percent. The weaker revenue performance is 
due to lower fee-based revenues more broadly, 
which are affected by previous quarter-end 
balances, lower transactional revenues related 
to reduced client activity, and a slowdown in net 
flows, all of which were only partially offset by 
higher net interest income. While net interest 
income increased in absolute terms over 
2022 on an annualized basis, all wirehouses 

reported declines in net interest income in their 
most recent quarterly reporting relative to Q4 
2022, due to the slower pace of rate hikes and 
the impact of “cash sorting” (client deposits 
dropped by 10 percent from the fourth quarter 
of 2022, and deposit balances fell another  
3 percent in the third quarter of 2023). Pretax 
margins declined by three percentage points to 
22 percent as costs grew by 5 percent.

 — Private banks experienced 6 percent growth in 
client assets and 4 percent annualized revenue 
growth (compared with a 12 percent increase 
in 2022). Growth in net interest income, the 
main driver of revenue growth in 2022, tapered 
off as clients in this segment shifted toward 
higher-yielding liquidity solutions. Costs 
increased by 4 percent, resulting in a flat pretax 
profit margin of 36 percent.

 — Independent broker–dealers grew assets by  

9 percent, thanks to strong adviser recruitment 
by the largest firms and recent acquisitions of 
RIAs and smaller broker–dealers. Revenues 
grew at an annualized 13 percent rate (versus 
12 percent for the same set of firms in 2022), 
the highest rate of all delivery models, due 
to a more than 100 percent increase in net 
interest income that carried over from 2022 
from rising interest rates, favorable terms 
with partner banks, and volume growth 
across cash offerings. Unlike other delivery 
models, cash sorting has not been as much 
of a headwind because existing deposit 
volumes are much lower (on a per account 
basis) and smaller average client sizes likely are 
resulting in “stickier” deposits. We estimate 
that approximately 45 percent of independent 

While the overall picture in 2023 has been 
largely favorable to wealth managers, dynamics 
differ across delivery models.

broker–dealer revenue growth in the first 
three quarters of 2023 has come from net 
interest income, compared with 70 percent  
in 2022. Finally, costs have grown by  
7 percent, and as a result, profit margins for 
this segment have soared on a relative basis, 
the largest improvement among delivery 
models (a four-percentage-point increase, 
reaching 22 percent margins).

 — Registered investment advisers grew 

assets by 9 percent, benefiting from adviser 
movement into the channel, the steady 
pipeline of custodian referrals, and the 
emerging success of direct marketing by 
the largest RIAs. However, revenues were 
flat, compared with an 8 percent increase in 
2022. Notably, RIAs have little to no interest 
rate exposure, which contributed to the lower 
revenue growth versus independent and 
regional broker–dealers; it may also make 
them more resilient than other models to a 
lower-rate environment. 

 — National and regional broker–dealers grew 
assets by 6 percent and revenues by  
7 percent on an annualized basis (similar to 

their 2022 performance), driven by strong 
net flows from adviser recruitment and the 
continued growth in net interest income, 
which grew the second fastest, behind 
independent broker–dealers. In turn, costs 
grew by 7 percent, resulting in pretax profit 
margins of 17 percent—the same figure as the 
prior year. 

Overall, despite the macroeconomic 
uncertainties, industry performance remains 
relatively strong in 2023, largely due to continued 
high interest rates and partially recovered 
capital markets. But wealth managers need to 
be clearheaded about the temporary nature 
of this reprieve and may want to invest now in 
preparation for a more challenging environment. 
And it is not just macroeconomics that will 
change. The long-established lines along which 
the industry is structured are evolving, and firms 
will face a new competitive paradigm. As always, 
structural shifts open up as many opportunities 
for striking out ahead of the pack as cracks in 
which laggards can stumble.

US wealth management: Amid market turbulence, an industry converges 

11

Convergence is here

Amid a three-year span of unprecedented market 
volatility and macroeconomic shifts—record-high 
equity markets followed by the largest single-year 
decline in a decade and the fastest and highest 
interest rate hikes in history—it might be easy 
to overlook the acceleration of a more industry-
specific trend: the convergence across traditional 
wealth management delivery models. 

This trend itself—a long-brewing response to 
client and adviser preferences and the need for 
diversification of revenue streams—is not “new 
news.” Wealth managers have for some time been 
adding banking and lending services and trying to 
compete across a full range of client segments. And 
advisers have been converging around planning-led 
value propositions and adding services including 
insurance, tax preparation, and bill payment to 
make client relationships stickier. But thanks to the 
catalyzing impact of technology and the evolution 
of client and adviser needs, we are now on the cusp 
of this convergence solidifying into a new industry 
structure.

After decades of convergence, many wealth 
management platforms are starting to look more 
like one another, and the delivery channels based 
on business models (for example, wirehouses), 
affiliation (independent broker–dealers), type of 
relationship (RIA versus brokerage, advised versus 
self-directed), product focus (banking led versus 
investment led), and ownership (bank or insurance 
owned) are becoming less relevant. Ultimately, 
end clients are not very aware of the differences 
between delivery models, and they evaluate their 
advisers and wealth managers based on their direct 
experience.

In response to evolving client and adviser needs 
and the continued march of technology, data, and 
analytics, wealth management firms across delivery 
models have been converging across four axes.

 McKinsey Affluent and High-Net-Worth Consumer Insights Survey.

The one-stop shop
More than ever, clients prefer one-stop-shop 
solutions for financial and other needs adjacent to 
wealth management. When we surveyed wealth 
clients in 2018, 29 percent said they prefer holistic 
advice across adjacent needs; in our 2023 survey, 
the figure jumped to 47 percent, a 60 percent 
increase (Exhibit 7). The biggest growth in adjacent 
needs has been in lending and banking services: 
our survey indicates that approximately 30 percent 
of clients with $1 million to $25 million in investable 
assets prefer to consolidate banking and wealth 
relationships (rather than keep them with separate 
institutions), an increase of approximately 250 
percent since 2018.2 Younger investors are even 
more interested in a one-stop shop: more than 
73 percent of clients between the ages of 25 and 
44 prefer to consolidate their wealth and banking 
relationships, up from 20 percent in 2018 (Exhibit 8). 

Wealth managers have been responding. 
Wirehouses started integrating banking and 
lending solutions years ago, offering central asset 
accounts to serve as the funding center for their 
clients’ investment, credit, lending, and debit needs. 
Several national and regional broker–dealers have 
followed suit, offering banking and lending, with 
some acquiring banking charters. From the other 
direction, banks have been trying to enhance their 
wealth management offerings to better serve their 
deposit clients, and banks, custodians, turnkey 
asset management platforms (TAMPs), and 
fintechs are looking to innovate across banking 
solutions to provide white-labeled lending and 
cash management solutions for RIAs and broker–
dealers. In addition, wealth managers are adding 
nonfinancial products and services such as trust 
administration, tax preparation, estate planning, and 
lifestyle management services (bill pay, for example) 
to their platforms. Some firms are outsourcing 
these adjacent services or offering them through 
strategic partnerships; others, RIAs in particular,

have been acquiring tax practices, setting up 
trust administration, and building out concierge 
services to enhance their value propositions to 
clients. There is, of course, a defensive aspect to 
all of these moves: clients, or their heirs in case of 
intergenerational transfer, are less likely to go to a 
competitor for an adjacent service if they can easily 
add it to their existing relationship. 

In another sign of convergence, traditional adviser-
led wealth managers are offering digital-only 
options, while digital-direct firms are mirroring 
this approach and expanding their advisory 
services. The traditional firms are motivated 
by serving smaller clients profitably, attracting 
clients early in their wealth accumulation journey 
with the aspiration to serve them more fully later 
on, and accommodating clients who simply like 
having a digital option alongside an adviser. For 

their part, digital-direct firms are building out 
advisory offerings to better monetize their existing 
relationships by providing higher value. 

Of course, providing a broader set of products and 
services increases operational complexity and cost 
to serve, but it creates clear value over the long 
run by enabling wealth managers and advisers to 
have primary relationships with their clients, which 
translates into five times greater share of wallet 
than for secondary relationships. In some cases, 
it also enables greater retention of assets through 
the intergenerational wealth transfer (primarily 
through trust services and legacy planning), 
something advisers value. In addition, it helps 
diversify and expand revenue streams, primarily 
through net interest income—which has proved 
crucial for many wealth managers over the past 
year or so.

Come one, come all  
The second axis of convergence in US wealth 
management is the rise of multisegment platforms, 
whether segmented by client or adviser, as wealth 
managers seek to tap into wider asset and revenue 
pools. The trend holds across almost all delivery 
models (Exhibit 9). Consider a few examples:

for wirehouses and private banks.

with double-digit growth similar to that of RIAs

and 2022, according to our estimates.

build their own business. While there is growing 
adviser preference for independence, a significant 
portion of advisers prefer W2 employee affiliation 
with greater support and lower risk (especially as 
they build their client base).

On the adviser side, more individual advisers 
want the freedom to choose the affiliation that 
best serves their needs, and many are opting 
for independent models. Whether they opt for a 
custodian, broker–dealer platform, or employer, 
advisers need some degree of support from 
a trusted financial institution. Some enjoy the 
benefits and full-service support that come with 
the employee model; some value the greater 
autonomy of the 1099 independent model but 
do not want to deal with middle- and back-
office complexity; others seek the complete 
independence of the RIA model, where they can 

Both as a retention mechanism and a recruitment 
strategy, wealth management firms are 
increasingly catering to all of these affiliation 
preferences. Independent broker–dealers are 
acquiring RIAs with W2 advisers while enabling 
1099 advisers to affiliate with their broker–dealer 
or corporate RIA. Some of the largest independent 
and regional broker–dealers are expanding their 
platform services to include RIA custody to retain 
the assets of fully independent firms. Additionally, 
some wirehouses already have affiliated 
independent channels. Some of the largest and

fastest-growing wealth managers have multiple 
affiliation models to appeal to a broad range of 
adviser preferences. 

Novel approaches to client acquisition 
The fastest-growing wealth management firms 
are taking a fresh look at client acquisition. The 
traditional approaches—adviser recruitment 
and M&A, adviser led, client referrals, centers 
of influence—are still part of the mix, supported 
by adviser training and practice management, 
but many firms are turning to centralized lead 
generation to boost organic growth, especially 

among the younger clients (Exhibit 10). Acquiring 
client assets through adviser recruitment or M&A 
is estimated to be the most expensive model, with 
a cost of acquisition typically between 250 to 300 
basis points—varying widely depending on the 
size and quality of a specific book of business. 
Custodian referral programs seen in the RIA channel 
are another expensive model, with an estimated 
acquisition cost of 200 basis points, although the 
costs are smoothed out over the lifetime of the 
relationship. Successful direct marketers have 
achieved acquisition costs as low as 80 to 150 basis 
points, but this requires strong execution. The most 
attractive acquisition model comes from privileged 

Exhibit 10 
Referrals remain the largest source of new clients, but centralized lead 
generation is increasingly a major source. 

16

US wealth management: Amid market turbulence, an industry converges 

access to prospects through the workplace, retail 
banking relationships, or self-directed offerings. 
Firms with adjacent businesses that succeed at 
this cross-selling approach can achieve acquisition 
costs as low as ten to 20 basis points. 

In addition to their primary aim, wealth managers 
see these new acquisition channels as a 
differentiator in adviser recruitment. Consider that 
the average US wealth adviser is 50 years old and 
that 40 percent of total client assets are currently 
managed by advisers who are estimated to retire 
in the next decade. In this context, first-generation 
advisers continue to gather assets, improve their 
productivity, and seek opportunities to monetize 
their practice before retirement. Junior advisers, 
in contrast, are hungry for access to proprietary 
leads and for support from wealth management 
firms to grow their business and find succession 
opportunities. 

Strategies are emerging in five distinct areas:   

2.  Affiliated self-directed businesses. Digital-
direct firms and wealth managers with sizable 
self-directed businesses are setting up 
centralized lead generation capabilities to 
transition self-directed clients into higher-value 
advisory relationships. The most successful 
firms have developed systems across people, 
processes, and tools to drive acquisition costs 
down to as low as 20 basis points.

3.  Retail banking clients. Bank-owned wealth 
managers, which have historically relied on 
in-branch referrals, are increasingly deploying 
sophisticated marketing techniques and 
analytics to increase top-of-funnel conversion. 
They are also actively blurring the lines between 
traditional banker and financial adviser roles 
and are introducing collaboration models to 
maximize client experience. Successful bank-
owned wealth managers are acquiring clients 
from retail banking relationships for between 20 
and 70 basis points.

1.  Retirement and workplace. Wirehouses, 
independent broker–dealers, and RIAs 
have made significant investments in the 
retirement segment by building new businesses 
or acquiring existing ones. Acquisitions 
have centered around employee stock 
option administration solutions, third-party 
administrators (TPAs), and retirement plan 
advisory practices. In that third category, there 
were 74 acquisitions in 2022, compared with 
eight in 2017.3 Some are developing executive 
financial counseling offerings. From the other 
side, some recordkeepers are bolstering 
their retail offerings through acquisition and 
innovation, such as collective investment trusts 
and in-plan managed accounts, to build wealth 
management relationships with clients outside 
of retirement plans. These firms are leveraging 
their privileged access to prospects through the 
workplace (and often employer endorsements) 
to gain trust and capture both in- and out-of-
plan assets for acquisitions costs as low as ten 
to 20 basis points.

4.  Tax, insurance, and ancillary services 

providers. To better serve clients and gain 
privileged access to a new pool of prospects, 
independent broker–dealers and RIAs are 
acquiring firms that provide adjacent services. 
Recent acquisition examples include tax 
practices, insurance broker general agencies, 
trust administration service providers, 
and business management/CFO services 
companies. Although centers of influence 
with tax and insurance providers have been 
a common practice for many years, these 
acquisitions are too early in their development 
to estimate their client acquisition costs. 

5.  Direct-to-consumer marketing. Many wealth 
managers are now viewing direct-to-consumer 
marketing as a way to boost client acquisition, 
often starting with third-party affiliate 
marketing services. For example, many fast-
growing RIAs are looking to diversify away from 
the expensive custodian referrals by building 
proprietary direct marketing engines. When

management model.

firms focus on a narrow target segment with the 
right offer, the right marketing hook, and the 
right seller at the right time, acquisition costs can 
be as low as 70 to 80 basis points.

Firms with multichannel client acquisition engines 
not only can lower their cost of customer acquisition 
and achieve greater organic growth, but also can 
enhance their value proposition and use the access 
to proprietary leads as recruitment currency for 
advisers. 

Technology takes center stage 
Historically, traditional wealth management 
offerings relied almost solely on the client–
adviser relationship, with technology considered 
a secondary path to success. But advances in 
technology, data, and analytics started boosting 
client and adviser expectations: clients were looking 
for highly personalized experiences seamlessly 
delivered across web, text, app, and video channels, 
and advisers began to expect seamless desktop 
experiences, client portals, and middle- and back-
office processes. 

In response, about two decades ago, wealth 
managers began investing significant resources in 
technology, and the trend is accelerating. In fact, 
spending on technology has outpaced revenue 
and cost growth of the industry over the past 
five years (9 percent versus 8 percent versus 7 
percent, respectively, from 2016 to 2021), with a big 
jump in 2022 (19 percent year-over-year growth, 
versus 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively). Tech 
upgrades have spanned adviser desktops and 
tools, client portals, data feeds and integrations, 

cloud infrastructure, core tech modernization, and 
cybersecurity, among others. Today, assembling a 
tech stack across in-house and vendor solutions 
to support higher productivity for advisers and 
better experience for clients is a core competency 
for wealth managers. In addition, fintech and 
WealthTech have become core enablers. 

The emergence of generative AI is likely to bring 
technology even further to the forefront of the 
wealth management model and to push client and 
adviser expectations even higher. While we do not 
see gen AI displacing the role of the adviser in the 
near future, it provides a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity for wealth managers to improve client 
experience (in addition to other use cases across 
the value chain) and increase the productivity 
of advisers and other client-facing staff. In the 
latter category, gen AI is already being deployed 
to generate and synthesize meeting notes, draft 
financial plans and client briefs, support compliance 
reporting, and serve as a virtual assistant.

 According to McKinsey estimates, gen AI could help 
the average wealth adviser reorient 20 to 30 percent 
of their time toward growth-related tasks (Exhibit 11). 
The biggest time savings will come in preparation for 
client meetings, servicing of accounts, compliance, 
and financial planning. Unlocking this potential will 
require integration of gen AI into existing workflows 
and training programs for advisers and other 
client-facing staff. Wealth managers and advisers 
who capture gen AI’s potential first are likely to 
significantly outperform the rest of the pack, at 
least until the technology becomes more widely 
accessible and integrated across the industry.

Agenda for a new 
industry landscape

The past 18 months can be seen as a transition 
for the US wealth management industry—a sharp 
departure from a decade of relatively easy and 
predictable growth to a new, more challenging 
environment that will test each firm’s fundamental 
strengths. At the same time, wealth managers 
will be operating in a landscape shaped by new 
competitive dynamics as the distinctions between 
delivery models evaporate. 

Wealth managers can benefit from future-
proofing their strategies and deciding what big 
bets they want to make beyond business as usual. 
As we approach a definitive shift in the macro 
environment, US wealth firms are broadly in one of 
two positions: some benefited from rising interest 
rates and now have a unique opportunity to reinvest 
into their business for the future, and others will 
face tough choices about where to pull back or 
pursue transformational change to free up capacity 
that can be redeployed toward long-term growth. 

Thriving in this environment will require a focus 
on strategic positioning, operating model design 
across the value chain, and development of a 
well-tuned “execution engine” to create forward 
momentum. Wealth managers can position 
themselves in the shifting landscape by focusing on 
the following six areas:

1.  Expanded offerings. Expanding the scope of 
advice and product offerings in response to 
evolving client needs will be crucial; firms that 
do not keep up with evolving client needs and 
their desire to bank and invest in one place risk 
losing share to those that do. Wealth managers 
can pursue accretive impact by deciding 
where to lean in for their clients and acquire 
new capabilities, whether organically or via 
partnerships. The right approach will depend on 
the wealth manager’s starting position and the 
needs of its client (and adviser) bases.

2.  Institutionalized lead generation system. 

Building and scaling centralized lead generation 
capabilities is a proven competitive advantage, 
yet few wealth managers have mastered it. 
While putting in place and scaling such a 
system requires investment, the benefits are 
compelling. For example, the acquisition of 
a $1 million relationship can unlock $50,000 
to $70,000 in advisory fees over a decade, 
suggesting that wealth managers should 
be willing to spend as much as $15,000 to 
$20,000 on client acquisition. Gaining exclusive 
access to a large installed client base (for 
example, workplace) can further decrease 
client acquisition costs.

3.  Adviser talent strategy. A competitive adviser 
talent attraction strategy is vital in the industry, 
especially in light of projections that the number 
of advisers will remain flat (or, excluding RIAs, 
will decline by 1 percent per year) and the 
growing percentage of assets managed by 
advisers closing in on retirement. Near-term 
solutions include improving adviser productivity 
and enhancing the value proposition—for 
example, with succession solutions, technology, 
adviser compensation, paths to growth, or 
increased flexibility. At the same time, an 
innovative long-term approach to adviser 
development, compensation, and service 
models can attract new profiles of advisers—
including those new to the industry and from 
other roles in the industry—to serve the next 
generation of clients. 

4.  Adviser productivity leveraging gen AI. 

Embedding gen AI capabilities into workflows 
can move the needle on productivity of advisers 
and other client-facing and supporting roles. 
For this reason and others, the technology has 
potential to separate winners from losers over 
the coming years. Success with gen AI calls

for investments in technology coupled with 
a focus on risk, compliance, and importantly, 
change management across the organization. 
We expect to see outperformance by the firms 
that make the right big bets. 

5.  Resource reallocation. With clarity on 
strategic priorities, firms should take a 
granular look at spend across the organization 
and realign it in support of the priorities. Such 
an endeavor puts resources behind highest-
conviction growth priorities and is a thoughtful 
approach to cutting back on complexity. It 
often involves a realignment of incentives 
and KPIs to tailor them to various businesses 
operating at different speeds. 

6.  Target operating model. The final priority 
is the firm’s operating model. Redesigning 

the operating model is an opportunity to 
embed scalability and hardwire sources of 
competitive advantage. This includes creating 
a more flexible cost base that can adapt 
quickly to changing market conditions, as 
well as creating a culture that can be a force 
multiplier. 

Beneath the ups and downs that wealth 
managers have been experiencing lies significant 
opportunity. As the wealth management 
ecosystem undergoes a once-in-a-generation 
convergence, wealth managers of all sizes have 
an opportunity to reposition their franchises for 
a healthier future while broadening the ways in 
which they help clients and advisers meet their 
financial needs in an environment of greater 
uncertainty.
