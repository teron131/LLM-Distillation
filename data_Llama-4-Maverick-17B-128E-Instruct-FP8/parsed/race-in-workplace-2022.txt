Preface

Last year, we released Race in the Workplace: 
The Black experience in the US private sector, 
an in-depth look at the challenges Black workers 
face in corporate America.1 The report sought 
to provide a fact base to help executives better 
understand these issues so they could develop 
and implement effective programs to support their 
Black colleagues. 

This report builds on our previous work but 
shifts the focus to the experience of Asian, 
Black, and Latino employees on the front line—a 
segment of the workforce that has typically been 
disconnected from advancement opportunities. 
Even as companies elevated their diversity, equity, 
and inclusion (DEI) initiatives over the past several 
years in an effort to create a more welcoming, 
supportive workplace, these efforts often didn’t 
extend to workers beyond corporate levels. 

The front line—which makes up approximately 
70 percent of the total US workforce, or 
112 million workers—represents a tremendous 
but overlooked opportunity for corporations. 
Our research found that employees of color 
face an array of impediments to moving up 
the ladder. They are motivated to advance but 
lack opportunities for promotion. A majority 
report having no sponsors to provide support and 
guidance. And employees of color may not feel 
a sense of belonging and inclusion at their jobs, 
routinely feeling ignored and marginalized. 

These sentiments matter because for too 
many workers of color, the front line is both 
a starting point and an end point in their career 
journey—a revolving door of jobs that don’t offer 

opportunities to advance. This report shines a light 
on the pathways from the front line to the middle 
class as well as on the skills that are the key 
to advancement. 

Companies can step up to the responsibility to 
support frontline workers of color and increase 
opportunities to transition into higher-paying, 
more fulfilling jobs. The last chapter in this report 
offers steps companies could take to help enable 
their frontline workers to develop the necessary 
skills to pursue new roles.

We want to acknowledge that systemic racism 
represents an additional obstacle to frontline 
employees of color. Our research and analysis 
focused on the steps companies could take 
to improve outcomes for these employees. 
Addressing the impact of systemic racism 
requires system-level changes, which are beyond 
the scope of this report.

We are at the beginning of this conversation 
about the front line. More research needs to 
be conducted, such as quantifying how career 
advancement affects the overall job satisfaction, 
career prospects, and economic outlook of 
workers of color. In addition, analysis could explore 
the financial and business benefits for companies 
that improve the development, retention, and 
advancement of their frontline staff. 

We hope this report provides a starting point 
for executives in considering opportunities to 
unlock the full potential of workers of color on 
the front line. Progress could help change the lives 
of millions of workers. But more than that, it’s 
the right thing to do.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceIntroduction: The frontline trap

The vast majority of Americans are introduced to 
the workforce through frontline jobs—whether 
waiting tables, stocking store shelves, or folding 
clothes. Today, approximately 70 percent of the  
US workforce is concentrated in frontline jobs.2  
However, there is an ambition gap: 70 percent of 
workers want to advance, but just one in four will.

A common misconception is that workers can 
move from an entry-level frontline job to the top 
of the corporate ladder. To be sure, examples do 
exist: the fast-food CEO who learned the ropes 
on the fryer, the package delivery driver who 
ascended to the C-suite, or the record company 
executive who started in the mail room. But 
these examples are not representative of 
the frontline experience.

Too often, frontline jobs are both a starting point 
and an end point for workers. The majority of 
frontline workers never move up the ladder: just 
4 percent are promoted to entry-level corporate 
jobs.3 Instead, they cycle through a series of 
positions that represent lateral moves without 

ever gaining the necessary skills or having 
the opportunity to advance. Workers of color are 
particularly likely to remain in frontline jobs.

To date, frontline roles have been largely 
disconnected from traditional corporate 
programs. Companies have focused employee 
initiatives—such as training and DEI programs—
on employees at the corporate level. Companies 
have an opportunity to extend these programs 
to the front line to help restore trust, bridge 
the experience gap, and create a more 
equitable society. 

This report seeks to shine a light on workers of 
color in the frontline workforce—the issues they 
face, their pathways to career advancement, 
and the actions that both workers and 
companies could take to open up these paths 
to a greater share of workers (see sidebar 
“About the research”). Improvements to career 
advancement could have a tremendous impact 
for millions of workers—on their lifetime earnings, 
advancement, and job experience.

About the research 

This report draws on research and analysis comprising several different data sets. 

The Employee Experience Survey and the Race in the Workplace 2022 Talent Pipeline, which 
includes McKinsey’s Inclusion Assessment, provided data about the experiences and perceptions 
of employees across several areas (such as sponsorship, mentorship, feedback, advancement, 
and employee resource groups) cut by demographic factors (such as age, race, gender, and sexual 
orientation). The full data set for the talent pipeline analysis includes input from 51 companies and 
covers an estimated four million employees from the front line to the executive level. These findings 
were augmented by data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the American Community Survey, 
and more than 50 testimonials from frontline employees across different races. 

To understand career progressions, we drew on McKinsey research that analyzed the job histories 
of 29 million people and more than 800 occupations.1

workers,” McKinsey, June 2, 2021.

The frontline 
experience for 
workers of color 

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceThe front line is a vital part of nearly all sectors 
of the economy. These workers serve as 
the public face of many organizations and make 
tremendous contributions to the US economy. 
Frontline workers in industries from healthcare to 
transportation and logistics to foodservice carried 
the nation through the height of the pandemic 
in the United States. Yet they also experienced 
the greatest hardship from economic disruption. 

Despite their importance, these workers 
are often devalued by business and society. 
Many companies don’t extend programs 
promoting professional development and career 
advancement to the front line. It’s little wonder 
that frontline employees reported not feeling 
connected to their organization, supported 
by their managers, and optimistic about their 
career prospects. 

Workers of color, who are overrepresented in 
the US frontline workforce, feel these challenges 
more acutely than their White counterparts. At 
many companies, frontline roles are a revolving 
door with low pay and little advancement, leaving 
workers of color without a path to move up 
the ladder. As a result, more employees of color 
are in roles with lower job quality (for example, jobs 
that lack healthcare benefits or don’t pay a living 
wage4). They have less confidence that their 
organization will be fair and transparent, are less 
likely to have sponsors to help guide their career, 
and have less access to opportunities to advance. 
The prevalence of bias in the workplace frequently 
leaves workers of color feeling isolated and at 
a disadvantage. 

Career advancement and economic mobility are 
possible but only for a segment: just 30 percent of 
workers will move to a higher-income quintile over 

the course of their careers.5 Given that people of 
color make up a majority of frontline workers, that 
leaves the middle class6 beyond their reach. 

Gaining an in-depth understanding of the frontline 
workforce and experience is a critical step toward 
improving outcomes for all frontline workers.

Know your front line

With 112 million workers, the frontline workforce 
is massive but not a monolith. Frontline 
professionals (for example, school teachers and 
registered nurses) number 17 million workers 
who earn an average annual salary of $54,000.7 
Frontline hourly and salaried roles (such as retail 
salespeople, cooks, and store managers) are 
filled by 95 million workers who earn an average 
annual income of $33,000. (For more detail, 
see sidebar “Defining the front line.”) This 
report is primarily focused on lower-earning 
frontline hourly and salaried workers rather than 
frontline professionals.

A closer look at the demographics8 of the frontline 
hourly and salaried workforce demonstrates 
the untapped potential of its workforce: 

 — 29 percent of frontline workers are 
concentrated in ten occupations.

 — 78 percent do not have a four-year 

college degree.

 — Only 20 percent of frontline workers are under 

25 years old.

 — 42 percent of the front line are workers 

of color.

 — 70-plus percent of Black and Latino workers 

are in frontline roles (Exhibit 1).

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience Frontline workers are often economically 
insecure, defined by PolicyLink as 200 percent of 
the federal poverty line.9 This equates to an annual 
income of $27,180 and $46,060 for single- and 

three-person households, respectively. One in two 
frontline workers makes less than $30,000 a year; 
just 15 percent make more than $50,000.

Defining the front line

The front line encompasses multiple roles with varying 
levels of income and paths to advancement. For this 
report, we define frontline workers as those who work 
directly with customers or are directly involved in making or 
selling a product or providing a service (such as cashiers, 
salespeople, and housekeeping staff). These positions do not 
require advanced technical skills or credentials. Although in 
some circumstances professionals with advanced degrees 
(such as doctors, nurses, and teachers) are considered 
frontline workers, we are excluding them from this report 
because their experiences differ considerably from frontline 
hourly and salaried workers.

The nonprofessional front line can be divided into hourly roles 
(for example, retail salespersons, cooks, and drivers) and 
salaried positions (for example, facilities managers).

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience Frontline workers have not 
benefited from corporate America’s 
DEI investments 

As past McKinsey reports have detailed, workers 
at all levels endure challenges on the job, and 
this is particularly true for people of color.10 Yet 
our research found employees in frontline roles 
report the worst experience. Frontline hourly 
employees are nearly 20 percent less likely than 
corporate employees to believe that DEI policies 
are effective (Exhibit 2). Just one-third of workers 
in the bottom 10 percent of income had jobs 
with paid sick leave.11 In addition, 45 percent of 
hourly employees don’t believe their company 
encourages them to take advantage of work–life 

policies (for example, leave of absence and 
parental leave) without jeopardizing their 
employment or career advancement. 

In other words, the very employees who 
could benefit the most from DEI policies and 
programs have little faith in their organization’s 
ability to deliver. In our survey, employees of 
color associated words such as “inadequate,” 
“mistaken,” and “minimal” with their company’s 
DEI actions. And since a majority of workers of 
color are concentrated in frontline positions, 
this disconnect represents a huge missed 
opportunity on the part of corporate America to its 
entire workforce.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience Frontline hourly workers report 
a pervasive lack of fairness 
in promotions

An organization’s commitment to transparent 
performance reviews and promotions is critical to 
instill a sense of fairness among the workforce.12 
Our research explored the perceptions of 
frontline hourly employees regarding fairness and 
transparency in promotions. They are more likely 
than their salaried peers to feel their organization 
is inconsistent when it comes to promoting 
employees on merit and performance (Exhibit 3). 
Just 39 percent of hourly respondents believe 
their employer takes an objective, empirical 
view of performance and promotion. This lack of 
fairness underscores that investments in frontline 
workers have been ineffective and insufficient 
to date.

Our analysis suggests companies promote just 
4 percent of frontline workers to corporate roles. 
A couple of factors contribute to this pattern. First, 
companies typically do not create these paths, 
looking instead to different candidate pools to 
fill corporate roles. Second, many companies 
do not have training and development programs 
or people processes in place for their frontline 
workers, so high-potential workers are not on 
the radar to help develop skills that might qualify 
them for entry-level corporate jobs. 

Worker perceptions of enterprise inclusion—the 
extent to which an organization’s systems foster 
a welcoming and fair environment for all workers 
to be themselves—can affect the degree to 
which they feel valued and empowered to pursue 
advancement opportunities. Hourly employees 
also perceive less willingness from leaders and 
coworkers to treat others with mutual respect and 
be inclusive of their opinions.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience When I first got hired, they said 
that there are opportunities 
to move up, but there hasn’t 
been a whole lot of support. 
They kind of pick and choose 
who they want to be the next 
manager, who they want to 
promote, depending on how they 
feel about you. I guess some of 
it has to do with performance, 
but mostly, it seems to be 
somewhat related to favoritism.

I hear some of the talk that I need 
to hear, but I’m just not seeing 
the actions needed to help. We 
sit down and do one-on-ones and 
yearly feedback and talk through 
performance reviews, and you 
hear, ‘This is what we are going to 
need, and this is how we’re going 
to get you to the next level.’ But 
it’s just not happening. I feel like I 
contribute to my part of it, but I’m 
just not seeing that come through 
on … where they would contribute.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceFrontline workers of color want 
to advance but lack access 
to opportunities 

Our analysis also revealed a sizable gap between 
the desire of employees of color to advance and 
the availability of opportunities to do so (Exhibit 4). 
White frontline employees were most likely to 
report receiving advancement opportunities 
despite stating the lowest desire for promotion. 
By contrast, Latino employees experienced 
a 30-percentage-point spread between the desire 

to be promoted and the opportunity to advance, 
six times greater than that of White employees. 
Asian and Black frontline employees reported 
gaps that were only slightly narrower compared 
with their Latino counterparts. 

This lack of advancement opportunities 
weighs heavily on workers of color. Previous 
McKinsey research has found that limited career 
development and advancement is the top reason 
Black and Asian frontline workers plan to leave 
their companies.13

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience Asian workers: A tale of divergent experiences 

Fast facts1

5 percent of 
frontline workforce

Top industries: 
accommodation and 
foodservice, manufacturing, 
and healthcare

At first glance, Asian frontline workers appear to be poised for rapid advancement. 
They have the highest levels of education: 21 percent have earned at least a bachelor’s 
degree, compared with 16 percent of White workers, 10 percent of Black workers, 
and 8 percent of Latino workers. They also report higher levels of inclusion than other 
workers of color and are more likely to believe their workplace is fair and impartial.1 

Yet despite these advantages, Asians must overcome many of the same challenges as 
other workers of color: They consistently make less money than their White peers for 
the same job. They don’t feel supported, with more than half lacking a sponsor. And 
they report the highest levels of burnout among all frontline employees. 

Moreover, Asian workers are often stereotyped as being diligent and quiet, perceptions that could be a factor preventing them 
from moving into management positions.2 They experience a steady decline in representation by level, falling from 9 percent of 
frontline hourly roles to 5 percent of salaried positions.

The picture is complicated further by the fact that Asian workers represent a diverse array of nationalities and subgroups, 
each with its own distinct experience. For example, Southeast Asians report some of the lowest inclusion scores, while East 
and South Asians report among the highest.

Companies seeking to devise effective programs and provide support for Asian workers must dig beneath the top-line 
classifications to truly understand the specific challenges each subgroup faces.

With my current company, I’ve been in sales for six years and three 
different functions of sales. I wanted to jump into a sales leader 
role—that was what I was originally developing for—but for some 
reason I just could not get a fair shake, and I thought that I was 
missing leadership abilities, right? Because that’s kind of what they 
tell you, and sometimes they use that to block a job change when 
you get the qualification that they’re asking for.

The interesting thing is a lot of people look at me and they decide 
that Asian females are not good at sales. No matter how many 
years of successful experience I’ve had before and in my company 
currently, all they see is, well, she’s in operations now, she’s too 
‘black and white’ to understand sales. And I think it’s also just 
being an Asian woman: if I do not act in the way they expect me 
to—to be nice and docile—I get blacklisted. 

I’m trying to break that bamboo ceiling to help other people who 
look like me get through. And I would say I’m probably one of 
the few Southeast Asian women in leadership positions here.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceWorkers of color are 
overrepresented in the lowest-paying 
frontline industries

The pay for frontline roles varies significantly 
by industry. Our analysis found workers of 
color are significantly overrepresented in 
industries with the lowest-paying frontline roles 
(Exhibit 5). Consider that workers of color account 
for 58 percent of food and accommodation 
services, an industry with an average annual salary 

of just $28,000. By contrast, they make up just 
28 percent of frontline jobs in utilities, which pay 
around $84,000 a year. On average, Black and 
Latino frontline workers make 20 percent less 
than White frontline workers.

This distribution has a direct bearing on 
the financial prospects of frontline workers of 
color as well as on opportunities to advance their 
careers and obtain new skills.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience Frontline workers of color see 
representation fall from hourly to 
salaried roles 

In our participating companies, employees of color 
were overrepresented in frontline hourly roles and 
were 1.4 times less likely than White employees 
to advance into salaried roles.14 The trajectory 
differs by race—Asian employees see their share 
decline steadily from hourly to hourly manager to 
salaried roles, while Latino employees experience 

a small bump at the hourly manager level before 
declining significantly at the next rung (Exhibit 6). 
The representation of employees of color in 
corporate roles largely draws from a different pool 
of candidates.15

Overall, people of color see their share of frontline 
roles drop ten percentage points from hourly to 
salaried roles. Since frontline salaried roles are 
more likely to pay a living wage and have better 
benefits, they are more sustainable jobs.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceWorkers of color are held back by low 
levels of sponsorship 

at all, with Black frontline employees seeing 
especially low levels (Exhibit 7).

The level of support that workers receive on 
the job can have a direct impact on their career 
prospects. A mentor shares their knowledge, 
wisdom, and advice with more junior colleagues. 
A sponsor takes an active role in creating 
opportunities for more junior workers. They 
can also provide visibility into projects, job 
opportunities, and promotions and create a sense 
of community and belonging. 

This pattern appears to have a direct impact 
on career advancement. Our analysis found 
that employees are five times more likely to get 
a promotion if they have four or more sponsors. 
In effect, every sponsor translates to a roughly 
10 percent increase in an employee’s chance of 
getting a promotion.

Sponsorship is also an important contributor to 
inclusion16 and is an integral way for workers to 
receive coaching and direction on day-to-day skill 
development. By helping workers gain on-the-job 
experience, sponsors contribute to the earning 
potential of frontline workers with lower levels of 
education, especially in occupation categories 
such as agriculture and food service. 

Our research found that more than half of all 
frontline employees of color have at least one 
mentor in the workplace—in line with their White 
peers. But these relationships aren’t translating 
into sponsorships. Black and Latino frontline 
employees report the lowest levels of sponsorship: 
the majority (nearly six in ten) have no sponsor

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience Latino workers: Resilience in the face of challenges 

Fast facts

14 percent of 
frontline workforce

Top industries: agriculture, 
construction, and forestry, 
fishing, and hunting 

Latino workers, who are more likely than any other race to be in frontline roles, face 
several daunting challenges when it comes to careers. They have the second lowest 
wages of all groups, earning 22 percent less than White frontline workers, in part 
because of the occupations in which they are concentrated. They are the largest 
immigrant group of any race, with 85 percent of immigrants on the front line.1 
They also have the lowest education levels of any race: just 36 percent have some 
postsecondary schooling. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Latino frontline employees don’t feel included or supported 

on the job: they are significantly less likely than White employees to believe their employer allows self-expression and has 
adequate protective mechanisms in place. In greater numbers than other groups, Latino frontline employees cite a lack 
of support for employee well-being as a key reason for leaving their jobs. They also report the second-lowest level of 
sponsorship, a crucial element in advancement.

Despite these challenges, Latino employees in our sample have achieved a higher share of promotions from frontline jobs to 
entry-level corporate roles than other employees of color. They also report levels in inclusiveness in line with their White peers 
when they are promoted to corporate roles.

Misgivings about career advancement

I’ve been with this company for almost two years. I actually 
entered as a back-end team member but made the transition 
to the sales floor a few months ago. I was asked a couple times 
to be a supervisor after my one-year mark, and I turned down 
the position a few times before deciding to take it. I thought 
that I would need experience with some form of leadership 
and decided to finally say yes.

My manager has talked to me again about moving up in 
a year or so, but I don’t feel supported at all in my position. As 
the manager was telling me this news, I was just like, ‘If I feel 
like I’m not supported now, and I don’t have the right tools as 
a supervisor, I doubt you guys will give me the right tools for 
a role with more responsibilities.’

The only way I see myself advancing would be a lot of 
sacrificing. And maybe they think that as a Hispanic person, 
I’d be willing to do that because I want to move up. But to be 
honest, it’s not worth my mental health.

The store manager is Hispanic—she’s an immigrant. And 
it’s great, because she started as a cashier and made her way 
up. She’s a store manager now after 13 years at the company. 
That’s fantastic. That’s great. But at the same time, I see so 
much sacrifice, I see so many tears, I can see a lot of pain—
and I don’t want that for myself.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceFrontline workers of color do not feel 
included in the workplace

Inclusion consists of behaviors such as allyship, 
mutual respect, and advocacy as well as 
conditions such as shared prosperity and fair 
participation. Previous McKinsey research has 
highlighted the role of inclusion in increasing 
support for colleagues, employee retention, 
and favorable views of the organization, among 
other benefits.17

Frontline hourly employees report the lowest 
overall feelings of inclusion of all employees in 
the workforce, and differences in inclusion emerge 
as they climb the corporate ladder (Exhibit 8). 
While all groups feel more connected at higher 
levels of their organization, Black employees 
experience lower inclusion than their peers at 
most levels. This pattern essentially sets up 
a no-win situation for Black frontline workers: 
shared stressors in the front line or feelings of 
isolation as they move up the ladder.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience Frontline worker,hourlyFrontline worker,salariedEntry-level workerManager orsupervisorSeniormanager or directorExecutiveor vicepresidentThe Black frontline experience: 
Overcoming the trust deficit 

Fast facts

13 percent of 
the frontline workforce

Top industries: healthcare 
support, protective services, and 
community and social services

Our Race in the Workplace Survey found that among all frontline staff, Black workers 
have the largest enterprise trust deficit—defined as a gap in perception on attributes 
such as acceptance, fairness, and authenticity. 

This trust deficit affects nearly every facet of the Black frontline experience. For 
example, Black workers report the highest job satisfaction and lowest intention to 
leave. Yet they also experience the highest attrition rates. What is causing them to look 
to other organizations for opportunities? For many, it’s a lack of career development 
and advancement potential. Fully 84 percent of Black employees indicated a desire to 

be promoted, but just 62 percent perceived an opportunity to advance. 

They also don’t view their work environment as a meritocracy (Exhibit 9). A contributing factor is that Black frontline workers 
earn on average 25 percent less than their White peers.

The lack of trust manifests itself in numerous ways. Black workers are less likely to feel supported, encouraged, and treated 
as professional equals by their peers. Fifty-one percent of Black employees have at least one mentor, but just 38 percent 
said they have at least one sponsor, meaning many Black workers lack valuable direction and support on career paths and 
development opportunities. In addition, Black frontline employees report feeling included in the workplace less than any other 
racial group.

As poor as the experience is for Black frontline workers, it also represents a high-water mark. As they move up the ladder, they 
report feeling less included and supported than their peers. 

Struggling against entrenched perceptions

I feel that my race affects my trajectory in my company. 
While there are opportunities at times for advancement, 
a lot of times I am overlooked. My peers often doubt me, even 
though I share the same qualifications as everyone else. My 
skill set is judged, my professional judgment is in question 
a lot of times, and this reflects how the patients view me as 
a medical professional there to take care of them. It makes it 
really difficult. 

I feel the people of other races at the company don’t have 
to deal with this. In the same sense, it makes me work and 
do my job ten times harder. I take what I do very seriously, 
and this is something that Black workers deal with in 
the workplace setting—but you still have a job to provide. 

I relate well to my patients and to their families, and I 
communicate well with the doctors. Yet I still haven’t been 
offered promotions—even when I’ve asked for opportunities. 
I’m not sure of the bottom-line details or why it hasn’t 
happened. I just know I come and do my job to the best of my 
capabilities despite everything going on around me.

Creating a pathway 
for advancement 
from the front line

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceCareer advancement often requires much more 
than hard work alone. In fact, the best way for 
workers to advance is by moving from one job to 
another in an upward progression. The accumulation 
of skills and experience along the way can open up 
new opportunities.

Our analysis assessed occupations by their value and 
role in career advancement and identified concrete 
pathways for advancement. We found it is possible 
for workers to move from initial frontline jobs and 
the accompanying economic insecurity to roles with 
middle-class incomes and better career prospects. 

The existence of these pathways should be cause 
for optimism. They must also overcome entrenched 
biases within the workplace that limit opportunities 
and impede their advancement. For instance, 
many of the roles with pathways lean more on 
interpersonal skills than on formal education. Since 
the assessment of these skills is inherently more 
subjective, it allows bias to have a greater influence on 
promotion decisions. 

Charting the progression from the 
front line to better-paying jobs

A recent McKinsey research effort sought to 
identify the progression of frontline workers as 
well as the attributes and experiences that enable 
their advancement.18 We analyzed historical job 
progressions of four million workers without four-year 
degrees, also know as individuals skilled through 
alternative routes (STARs),19 who successfully 
transitioned from low- to higher-wage occupations 
and identified the jobs that created pathways 
to higher-paying roles. The career journey was 
segmented into five job categories20: 

 — Origin occupations are frontline jobs with pay of 
less than $37,000. Wait staff, retail salespeople, 
and maintenance workers are common 
Origin roles. 

 — Mid-wage Origin roles, such as automotive 
master mechanics and chefs provide a small 
increase in pay ($37,000–$42,000) for workers 
who transition from Origin roles. 

 — Roles in Historical Adjacencies, such as cargo 
and freight agents, electricians, and nurse 
practitioners, offer workers a bump in pay (to more 
than $42,000), but they have limited success as 
pathways to higher-wage occupations.

 — Gateway occupations give workers 

the opportunity to build skills and experience and 
earn more than $42,000 a year. Gateway roles 
include food service managers, vocational nurses, 
and radiologic assistants. 

 — Target occupations are jobs with middle to 
higher wages (more than $42,000) that are 
resilient to automation. Companies often hire 
for these roles based on job experience, not just 
credentials. Examples include sales managers, 
social workers, and critical-care nurses. 

For the purposes of this report, we refer to mid-
wage Origin, Gateway, and Historical Adjacencies 
occupations as “Next” jobs—that is, jobs representing 
a positive move for frontline workers in Origin 
roles. We consider Gateway jobs the most valuable 
because they enable workers to transition to Target 
occupations. Mid-wage Origin and Historical 
Adjacencies occupations are still considered positive 
steps because they offer increased pay, but they 
don’t offer as much opportunity to progress to 
Target occupations.

The progression from Gateway to Target roles 
represents a clear path to the middle class—better-
paying, higher-quality jobs and the greater economic 
security and career opportunities that come 
with them.

20   Most frontline jobs are concentrated in the Origin and Mid-wage Origins categories, but about 20 percent are Target jobs.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceSelect occupations have the potential to 
accelerate career advancement
Our analysis identified 77 Gateway occupations 
that are especially effective at unlocking job 
progressions into Target jobs (Exhibit 10). These 
roles can help workers develop new skills (for 
example, a customer service representative 
moving into an IT role) or broaden existing 
skills gained through work experience (such 

as a medical assistant moving into a more 
advanced role in healthcare). Although some 
Gateway occupations require certification, many 
do not. These pathways can enable frontline 
workers to draw on their work experience and 
accumulated skills to progress. Gateway roles 
are crucial because they have the potential to 
provide frontline workers with a clear path to 
the middle class.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience I do feel like my race and ethnicity 
impact my trajectory at my company. 
In the 12 years that I’ve been here, 
I’ve not seen many women of color 
or people of color be promoted. They 
have a good ol’ boy mentality: it’s 
just like they only see us at a certain 
level within the organization, and 
you can’t go further than that. 

We’ve had some really bright, 
talented Black individuals, but the 
culture just will not allow them 
to move forward or advance in 
positions that are beyond the bottom 
of the totem pole. I’m going to have 
to eventually make the decision 
to move elsewhere to pursue my 
goals and career dreams, because 
it’s just not going to happen here.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceNarrow, inconsistent definitions of 
professionalism and interpersonal skills are 
barriers to advancement for workers of color 
Part of the value in moving from one job to another 
is the ability to build on existing skills and add new 
ones. Interpersonal skills are particularly critical: 
70 percent of job progressions to Gateway and 
Target occupations rely on transferable skills 
such as leadership and social skills, which can be 
learned through on-the-job experience. However, 
the cultural context in which leadership and 
social skills are typically assessed is critical to 
understand and often acts as a barrier.

Research has found that many organizations 
believe employees of color lack the interpersonal 
skills needed to excel in new roles.21 And when 
employees of color do have the required skills, 
managers may not recognize them—perhaps 
due to factors such as cultural and language 
variations or implicit bias. In the transition from 
Origin to Next occupations, Black workers lose 
the most representation, while Latino workers do 

marginally better (Exhibit 12). Among jobs, such as 
customer service, that require interpersonal skills, 
general and office management, sales and selling 
techniques, negotiation, and team building were 
the most frequently required.

The challenges of assessing 
interpersonal skills in the front line

Since frontline jobs often involve interacting 
directly with customers or colleagues, workers 
are often assessed on their interpersonal skills—
the behaviors and skills that guide effective 
interactions. In a customer service role, for 
example, interpersonal skills include a worker’s 
ability to understand why a customer was 
unhappy and how to resolve issues. The challenge 
is that when a manager evaluates a worker’s 
interpersonal skills, the exercise can quickly 
become subjective and prone to different types of 
conscious and unconscious bias. These biases can 
hold back frontline employees of color.

A road map  
for change

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceOur research and analysis have clearly 
demonstrated that frontline workers want to 
develop, progress, pursue new opportunities, 
and find roles that are more fulfilling. In that 
regard, companies have the potential to mobilize 
and develop their front line, which could create 
benefits for workers and organizations alike.

Yet companies must provide more support 
to frontline workers to enable their career 
advancement. This will require companies to 
gain a better understanding of what frontline 
employees actually want and expect from 
their employer.22 

On an encouraging note, we have seen companies 
implement programs that could create a much 
richer, supportive frontline work experience. 
They have started to extend more support and 
opportunity to the front line, including higher 
starting wages, tuition reimbursement programs 
(such as Walmart’s LiveBetterU), better training, 
more flexible work schedules, child care, parental 
leave, and retirement benefits such as 401(k) 
accounts and financial planning. 

These actions are a good start, but companies 
must implement them on a widespread basis 
and then build on this foundation. Executives 
could extend DEI programs to the front line—the 
employees who are most negatively affected by 
current inequities—and tailor them to the specific 
needs of these workers. Companies could also 
act to ensure frontline workers have equitable 
access to development opportunities. They could 
also seek to transform their culture, including 
making sure managers have broader cultural 
awareness, to reduce the impact of biases around 
interpersonal skills. Organizations have also 
begun to champion more inclusive, skills-based 
hiring practices for the more than 70 million 
STAR workers.23 

This section offers a road map for companies to 
address myths about the front line and implement 
solutions that could improve the lives and 
livelihoods of frontline workers in a material way. 
Collectively, these actions could chart new paths 
to advancement, achievement, and prosperity.

Addressing three myths

Frontline employees consistently report a poor 
work experience and have difficulty advancing into 
more fulfilling, higher-paying jobs. These ongoing 
challenges have impeded progress because 
corporate leaders are unaware of the actual 
barriers they need to remove. We believe 
companies could make dramatic improvements in 
the frontline experience with potential solutions to 
three myths. 

Myth 1: Frontline workers are free to 
move up the corporate ladder. 

Reality: More than 70 percent of frontline 
workers want to be promoted within their 
companies, but only 4 percent make the leap 
to corporate. 

While relatively few frontline workers get 
promoted to corporate jobs, it’s not for lack of 
interest. By acknowledging this truth, companies 
can turn their focus to increasing that number. 
Three specific actions can open this pathway to 
more workers:

Formalize paths for advancement from 
the front line to corporate roles
Companies could remove artificial barriers to 
promotion and create clear paths from initial 
frontline roles to higher-paying jobs with more 
opportunity. This priority has two elements: first, 
companies could facilitate conversations with 
frontline workers to understand their interests 
and identify development needs. Second, they 
could consistently highlight internal job openings 
with the potential for career advancement. 
This enhanced visibility can combat systemic 
disparities by creating equal access to information 
and resources and ensuring qualified candidates 
are aware of these positions.

Overhaul the frontline talent 
management system 
Implementing a systematic debiased approach 
to performance reviews could help companies 
identify frontline workers for advancement 
opportunities and create individual development 
plans. By adopting skills-based practices 
(rather than four-year degrees) across the talent

employees want—and what employers think they want,” McKinsey, July 21, 2022.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience The impact of sponsorship
I started five years ago in the industry I am in right 
now. My sponsors have been very effective, and 
they’ve allowed me to rotate jobs and learn about 
different departments. I’ve been able to learn new 
types of skills. Instead of learning one to three 
things, I’ve been able to learn seven, eight, nine, ten 
different things. I’ve learned the different aspects 
of the company—whether it be doing deliveries, 
checking boxes, or talking to customers.

I started as a delivery driver. Then I moved up to 
delivery manager, then field manager, then sales 
manager—all within the same company. And I’ve 
gotten promotions to learn new skills every time.

Now I have role models and new skills. I’m learning 
from managers and leaders—what they have done; 
their failures and habits; how they’ve succeeded—
and it has helped me learn where I can go.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experiencemanagement journey—from sourcing to 
interviewing to onboarding, upskilling, and internal 
promotions—organizations could help reduce bias 
and create more opportunities for upward mobility 
among people of color. Companies could also use 
analytics to mitigate bias in hiring, performance 
reviews, and promotions to ensure that high-
potential workers aren’t sidelined unnecessarily.

Establish a talent market program 
The path for advancement often includes 
a progression to different types of roles—for 
example, from customer service representative 
to computer-user-support specialist. Companies 
that can’t accommodate these paths could partner 
with other companies (through talent platforms 
and brokering) to orchestrate smart job moves for 
promising workers.

Myth 2: Frontline workers are not 
qualified for higher-level roles.

Reality: 70 percent of job progressions 
to Gateways hinge on transferable 
interpersonal skills, which are best learned 
through experience.

With the removal of structural barriers, frontline 
workers could have a stronger chance of 
progressing to higher-paying jobs that can usher 
them into the middle class. Companies can 
support upward mobility by emphasizing on-the-
job experience, and creating more transparency 
around opportunities and skills needed. 

Define the skills frontline workers need for 
higher-level roles 
Companies can catalog the skills that frontline 
workers are gaining in their current roles and 
then compare these skills with the specific 
requirements for Next roles. An example would 
be moving from a cook in a restaurant to a food 
manager to a branch manager to the corporate 
office. Companies could then chart out potential 
progressions for frontline workers to move 
from Origin jobs to Next roles. This exercise 
could include determining where to invest in 
development opportunities to help employees 
address skill gaps.

Reward experience rather than relying 
on credentials
Transforming perceptions of interpersonal skills 
is a critical factor in advancement to Gateway and 
Target roles. Companies should consider shifting 
their hiring requirements away from a credentials-
based approach that serves as a proxy for certain 
skills. Currently, 75 percent of jobs require a four-
year degree, but just 40 percent of applicants 
have one.24 Instead, organizations could prioritize 
credentials that reflect relevant skills while 
recognizing skills attained through job experience. 
To support the acquisition of skills, companies 
could create project-based opportunities from 
frontline jobs to manager and corporate roles 
where workers can be exposed to different 
experiences, learn new skills, and “fail safely.”

Identify Gateway jobs, and remove artificial 
barriers to promotion
Companies could share information about internal 
career progressions with frontline workers, with 
an emphasis on the Gateway roles available to 
workers in certain jobs. Given the importance 
of Gateway roles in altering career trajectories, 
companies could ensure they consider a diverse 
slate of candidates for these roles and aspire 
to promote workers in line with their share of 
the frontline workforce. Companies could track 
and disaggregate promotion data by race and 
gender at a minimum and provide these data 
to managers.

Myth 3: High rates of turnover are 
just the way it goes on the front line. 

Reality: Companies have a responsibility to 
create a better employee experience. 

For too long, companies have accepted high 
attrition on the front line as an immutable fact. 
Many frontline employees report leaving their jobs 
due to a lack of support and sense of belonging, 
but it doesn’t have to be this way. Companies 
can improve the workplace environment to 
make the worker experience more positive and 
sustainable. In doing so, they could capture 
a range of benefits, from improved reputation to 
an enhanced ability to attract talent.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience Give a voice to frontline workers
The front line makes up a large portion of 
the total workforce at many companies, acting as 
the organization’s operational muscle. Executives 
can harness the frontline workforce’s talents by 
making it an innovation engine—gathering insights 
from customer-facing employees, involving 
frontline workers in decision making, and giving 
them a platform to share ideas with senior leaders. 
Companies could also consider expanding 
benefits, such as employee stock ownership 
plans (ESOPs), that can contribute to meaningful 
wealth creation. These efforts could help frontline 
workers feel more included and invested in 
the business. 

‘Raise the floor’ on the frontline experience 
Frontline employees report dissatisfaction with 
their existing jobs due to a lack of opportunities 
for career advancement, uncaring and uninspiring 
leadership, and inadequate total rewards 
packages. Improving job quality can contribute 
to the overall experience and satisfaction of 
workers. Companies should consider reassessing 
the benefits available to frontline workers and 
expanding their offerings. For example, mental-
health support, greater flexibility in the workplace, 
and improved transparency and predictability 
in scheduling could help improve the frontline 
experience. In addition, organizations could 
encourage employees to take advantage of 
these programs. 

Invest in frontline managers 
Frontline managers are the key shapers of worker 
experience and sometimes the only point of 
contact for an employee. Companies can show 
their commitment to elevating the frontline 
experience by improving the representation of 
workers of color in manager roles. 

Companies could also provide these leaders 
with improved instruction and resources—for 
example, diversity and bias training as well as 
training in social-justice-based conflict resolution. 
Managers who develop better listening skills are 
better equipped to spot promising talent, such 
as workers with interpersonal skills. Companies 
could make investments to ensure that effective 
sponsorship for workers is a responsibility for 
frontline managers. Initiatives could include 
a mix of on-the-job training, coaching, and 
opportunity creation. 

Conclusion

For tens of millions of workers of color, frontline 
jobs have the potential to be far more than 
just a livelihood. Companies that truly invest in 
the front line can make these roles a starting point 
for a fruitful career, a clear path to the middle 
class, and a way to transition to interesting new 
jobs across industries. Much work remains to 
fulfill this aspiration. But for workers who have 
been traditionally overlooked, the time is long past 
due for companies to provide more opportunities 
and support.

Common traits of frontline workers of color that have advanced their careers  

As we have noted, workers of color face 
multiple roadblocks to progressing 
in frontline roles. While companies 
step up their support for the front line, 
workers of color could follow the lead 
of peers who successfully navigated 
pathways to advance their careers. 
Our analysis suggests several common 
traits of these workers.

They got as much on-the-job coaching 
as possible. These workers asked to 
shadow more senior peers on tasks 
in order to gain more exposure and 
benefit from additional guidance. These 
informal interactions often turned into 
more formal sponsor relationships.

They were open to taking on new 
tasks. Work experience accounts for 
46 percent of the average person’s 
accumulated skills. Workers who 
volunteered for new assignments not 
only broadened their knowledge and 
experience but also distinguished 
themselves by showing initiative.

They reframed skill sets to match 
the qualifications for Next roles. 
These workers were thoughtful in how 
they positioned their qualifications, 
particularly given the importance 
of interpersonal skills. For example, 
a successful barista may be an expert 
at making coffee but may also have 
the more marketable skill of providing 

an excellent customer experience in 
high-stress environments. 

They actively sought out companies 
that emphasize advancement. 
Believing all jobs and organizations 
are the same is a trap. If a company 
isn’t providing opportunities to move 
into other roles, these workers sought 
employers that champion mobility 
within the organization. However, not 
all workers have the time and resources 
to apply for new jobs, the flexibility to 
take time off to interview, or access 
to transportation to travel to and from 
interviews. Such support will also be 
integral to enabling workers to pursue 
new opportunities.

Race in the workplace: The frontline experienceMethodology 

External research in this report is based on 
economic and labor data of frontline workers 
in the Unites States. Sources consulted are 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational 
Employment Statistics (2019); the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics Current Population Survey (2019); 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 
EEO-1 data (2018); the Quarterly Census of 
Employment and Wages; EMSI data (2019); and 
Moody’s Analytics. The data from those sources 
were combined with data from the United States 
Census Bureau American Community Survey 
(2019) to help gain perspective on frontline 
workers across different races. Research data 
predate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on 
the US labor force, so these effects are not 
reflected in Part 1 of this report. 

Participating company research is based on 
53 companies, which collectively employ four 
million workers and represent the bulk of major 
industries across the United States. Participating 
companies submitted talent pipeline data, 
and HR professionals provided information on 
policies, programs, and priorities on behalf of their 
companies. Approximately 15,000 employees 
from ten of the participating companies were 
surveyed on their workplace inclusion experience. 
Participation in the Employee Experience 
Survey was encouraged but optional. All data 
collection occurred from January to May 2022.  
In addition, individual testimonials and surveys 
were collected from 52 frontline workers across 
all races and genders. Talent pipeline data reflects 
the representation of employees as of December 
2021, as well as personnel changes (for example, 
due to promotion, hiring, or attrition) during 
the 2021 calendar year. The broader Inclusion 
Assessment benchmark includes survey feedback 
from 31 companies and 59,000 US employees 
surveyed from September 2020 to March 
2022. These data sets represent point-in-time 
snapshots and reflect companies’ responses and 
employees’ experiences at the time that the survey 
was taken. We did not collect employees’ direct 
personal identifiers (for example, name, employee 
ID, and email address) from companies or through 
the survey.

Pipeline data and analytics
Overall metrics 
All pipeline metrics (for example, representation, 
promotion rates, hiring shares, or attrition rates) 
were initially calculated for each participating 

company. Aggregate results across companies 
were then calculated by taking the unweighted 
average of the representation, promotion rates, 
hiring shares, and attrition rates of all companies. 

Definition of job levels 
Companies categorized their employees into nine 
levels based on the following standard definitions, 
taking into account reporting structure and 
salaries. The levels and definitions provided were 
as follows: 

 — L0—Board of directors. Official directors 
of the board, responsible for organization 
and management

 — L1—Executives. CEO and direct reports to 

the CEO, responsible for company operations 
and profitability

 — L2—Senior vice presidents and other similar 
jobs. Senior leaders within the organization 
with significant business unit or 
functional oversight

 — L3—Vice presidents and other similar jobs. 

Leaders within the organization, responsible 
for activities or initiatives within a subunit 
of a business unit or function or who report 
directly to senior vice presidents

 — L4—Senior managers. Seasoned managers 
and contributors, responsible for multiple 
teams and discrete functions or operating units

 — L5—Managers. Junior managers and 

contributors, responsible for small teams or 
functional units or operations

 — L6—Entry level. Employees responsible 
for carrying out discrete tasks and 
participating on teams, typically in an office or 
corporate setting

 — L7A—Field or frontline (salaried). Salaried 
operational or customer-facing jobs, 
usually trained on the job and not requiring 
specialized credentials 

 — L7B— Field or frontline (hourly people 

managers). Operational or customer-facing 
roles, usually trained on the job and not 
requiring specialized credentials; specifically 
for roles who manage or supervise at least 
one person

 — L7C—Field or frontline (hourly individual 

contributors). Hourly operational or customer-
facing jobs, usually trained on the job and not 
requiring specialized credentials

Race in the workplace: The frontline experience Metrics and analytics
Talent pipeline data included the representation 
of race and ethnicity (overall and by gender). 
Additionally, companies reported the number of 
individuals of each race who were hired, promoted, 
or left the company (overall and by gender). 
Promotion and attrition rates were calculated 
for each race overall at each level. Promotion 
rates were calculated by dividing the number 
of promotions of individuals of that race into 
a given level by the total number of promotions 
at that same level. Attrition rates were calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals of each 
race who left the company at a given level by 
the number of individuals at that level. 

Employee experience survey and analytics 
Survey participation
More than 15,000 employees from ten companies 
elected to participate in the Employee Experience 
Survey. The survey questions covered multiple 
themes (for example, sponsorship, mentorship, 
feedback, advancement, and Employee Resource 
Groups), as well as demographic questions 
(for example, age, race, gender, and sexual 
orientation). The survey also incorporated 
McKinsey’s Inclusion Assessment. 

Bivariate and multivariate statistical reporting
Survey results were reported as an unweighted, 
pooled average of responses across companies. 
Many of the questions offered a five-point, labeled 
response scale (for example, “strongly disagree” 
to “strongly agree”). Unless otherwise specified, 
analyses aggregated the top two and bottom 
two boxes of the response scale (for example, 
“somewhat agree” and “strongly agree”). Where 
we highlight differences between races or other 
groups, we highlight only those differences 
that are substantial and reliable. To that end, all 
differences noted in this report are statistically 
significant at a confidence level of 95 percent 
(using a two-tailed test) and reflect a difference 
of at least five percentage points between 
two groups. 

Inclusion Assessment
Methodology behind the Inclusion Assessment 
McKinsey’s Inclusion Assessment provides 
two ways to help us understand the state of 
inclusion: scores and gaps. Inclusion scores 
show the perceptions of inclusion indicated by 
a percentage of favorable responses. Gaps show 
the score differences between employee groups 

(for example, in-groups and out-groups) that 
represent inconsistency of experiences.

There are four measures of inclusion in 
the assessment:

 — Overall inclusion score. This reflects 
the degree to which an organization’s 
processes, systems, and people foster 
a welcoming and fair environment for 
all employees to be themselves, make 
connections, and meaningfully contribute. It 
is measured by averaging all enterprise and 
individual-level scores.

 — Subscores. Enterprise perception subscores 
tell us how employees view the strength 
of acceptance, camaraderie, and fairness 
across all groups of the enterprise. Individual 
experience subscores tell us how employees 
personally feel encouraged to bring their 
full, authentic selves to work (authenticity 
and belonging) and feel empowered to make 
meaningful contributions (meaningful work).

 — Inclusion outcome scores. These tell us 
the effectiveness of shaping an inclusive 
organization and are measured by percentage 
of favorable responses on an agreement scale. 
Examples include acceptance, authenticity, 
and belonging. 

 — Inclusion practice scores. These show 

the occurrence of behaviors and actions 
that drive inclusiveness and are measured 
by percentage of favorable responses on 
a frequency scale. Examples include work–life 
support, meritocracy, protective mechanisms, 
team building, and so on.

Employee interviews 
The insights on experience in this report come 
from the surveys conducted across approximately 
15,000 employees from ten of the participating 
companies and the broader Inclusion Assessment 
benchmark, which includes survey feedback 
from 31 companies and 59,000 US employees 
surveyed from September 2020 to March 2022. In 
addition, we collected individual testimonials from 
50 frontline workers and preliminary experience 
analysis from 1,600 workers.
