McKinsey on Finance

Welcome to a very special edition of McKinsey on 
Finance: our 20th-anniversary edition—and issue 
number 80.

This edition is largely a compendium of McKinsey on 
Finance articles that we have published over the 
past two decades. We chose these articles not just 
because they have been among our most read and 
shared pieces and help reflect the breadth and depth 
of what we have been addressing, but also because 
we believe they are particularly relevant for readers 
today. The compendium articles are presented in 
five categories: (1) fundamentals of strategy and value 
creation, (2) strategic combinations and divestitures, 
(3) ESG, (4) CFOs and the evolving finance function, 
and (5) debiasing investment and strategy decisions. 
The articles within each compendium category are 
grouped by themes, not chronologically. 

Of course, seasoned CFOs and company leaders—
and those who aspire to leadership, or simply love 
finance—know that challenges neither neatly arrange 
themselves into categories nor wait to present 
themselves one at a time. If only it were that simple!  
They arrive together and affect, and are affected  
by, one another. 

There are, therefore, important lessons we can draw 
from a higher-level view. Three of the most important 
takeaways are described in the opening article, 

“Reflections on 20 years of McKinsey on Finance—
and three challenges ahead,” written for this edition 
by Michael Birshan and Ishaan Seth (who colead 
McKinsey’s Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice 
globally) and Tim Koller (the founder of McKinsey  
on Finance, a member of the McKinsey on Finance 
board since its inception, and a core leader of the 
firm’s Strategy & Corporate Finance Practice). There 
are also clear patterns we can observe over the long 
term (though they are sometimes less apparent  
in the immediate, shorter term) about the market’s 
ability to deliver real returns over generations. We 
present those findings in the featured exhibit and 
brief essay on our closing pages, “Looking back.”

Today, the sine qua non of effective free markets is 
sustainable, inclusive growth. Markets, after all, 
aren’t essentially trading floors or digital algorithms. 
Rather, markets are the amalgamation of what 
individuals, each with their own immeasurable worth, 
value now and tomorrow. A robust, sustainable 
market can thrive only if more and more people take 
part: cooperating, competing, investing, creating, 
and solving in a responsible way, for the long term, 
to provide solutions that other people value. 

So here’s to the next 20 years: may we continue to 
solve together.

Revolutionary innovations, brilliant ideas,  
and climate imperatives will change everything—
except the rules of finance and economics.

by Michael Birshan, Tim Koller, and Ishaan Seth

This is the 20th anniversary of McKinsey 
on Finance—and the 80th issue. We 
released our first in the summer of 2001, 
when companies were still reeling from 
the dot-com crash—and only a few weeks 
before the world-shattering events of 9/11.1

In the decades since, we’ve seen wars, 
financial crises, a global pandemic,  
a substantial decline in trust for some 
major institutions, and a heightened 
urgency about existential climate change. 
We’ve witnessed technological advances 
on an almost incomprehensible scale, 
millions of people lifted out of poverty, 
the dramatic rise of Asia, and stunning 
medical breakthroughs. 

article, we address three of the most 
pressing challenges for large com panies: 
massive innovation, good ideas taken too 
far, and competitive advantage in the net-
zero transition.

What will the next 20 years bring?  
One ignores the likelihood of immense 
changes at one’s peril. We don’t have  
a crystal ball. But we do have a compass: 
long-term value creation.2 We’ve studied, 
been challenged about, sharpened our 
thinking on, and ultimately reinforced  
our appreciation of core economic and 
financial principles, particularly as they 
apply through very uncertain times. 

Winston Churchill famously observed 
that “the longer you can look back, the 
farther you can look forward.” We might 
add, “and the more broadly you can see.” 
There are certainly a great many more 
challenges worth considering. In this

companies to consider implications for a wide 
range of stakeholders and to be proactive

1

Investing in innovation: A lesson in creative destruction

The past 20 years have seen tremendous innovation in the real economy. Advances have been 
profound across sectors—and even created new ones. When we launched McKinsey on  
Finance, Alphabet, Amazon, Netflix, and Tencent were in their early days. Apple had not yet 
introduced the iPod, let alone the iPhone. Airbnb and Meta did not exist. Tesla was known,  
if at all, as a Serbian engineer. 

In fact, well beyond the tech sector, innovations have added years to life, and life to years—and 
unleashed tremendous value. Life sciences companies continue to conceive of and introduce 
lifesaving medicines and therapies, sometimes at almost inconceivable speeds (prominently so in 
the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies). In consumer packaged goods, to take 
food and beverages as just one example, we’ve seen healthier foods and more consumer choice, 
including new and popular waters, iced teas, and alcoholic beverages. Retailing has been 
upended by e-commerce. Automobiles are not only going electric but also may someday be 
smart enough to drive themselves. 

From an economy-wide perspective, it doesn’t matter where the innovation comes from; we  
all benefit. But from the perspective of big companies and their investors, it’s disappointing that 
so much innovation has come from outside company walls. Some large companies do follow 
through on building new businesses. Yet our colleagues have found that while 84 percent of CEOs 
believe that innovation is critical to growth, only 6 percent of CEOs are satisfied with their 
company’s innovation performance. 

Loss aversion, bureaucracy, and organizational inertia can often make large corporations hit  
the brake on innovation. While bigger companies do create incentives for progress by purchasing 
innovations from smaller companies, this may be an inefficient use of capital: shareholders of 
large corporations can sometimes pay more for innovation than they would if they had funded it 
at the source. Shareholders are sometimes left holding the bag as far more innovative companies 
leave traditional ones behind. 

While 84 percent of CEOs believe 
that innovation is critical to 
growth, only 6 percent of CEOs 
are satisfied with their company’s 
innovation performance.

6

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionWhat has happened over the past two decades is a textbook illustration of Joseph Schumpeter’s 
creative destruction: if a business doesn’t disrupt itself, a more innovative business will disrupt it 
instead. We believe that large companies can be innovative, but only if they are willing to encourage 
risk taking and stop worrying so much about quarterly earnings. The future will not be decided  
in a quarter. The smartest investors know this, and our research shows these investors are the ones 
who drive share prices in the long term.3 Although they pay attention to quarterly earnings for 
clues about a company’s future prospects, they don’t want companies to meet quarterly earnings 
at the expense of long-term health and growth. 

There is no evidence that companies which consistently meet or beat consensus estimates are 
valued more highly than companies which fluctuate around the consensus. On the contrary: 
companies that play for the short term are more likely to lose ground over the longer term or fail 
entirely.4 Indeed, sustained growth without sufficient investment in innovation is incredibly hard 
to pull off. One recent study from our colleagues found that only about one in ten companies 
achieved higher revenue growth and profitability than their peers across a given decade-long 
cycle of economic downturn and prosperity. 

2

Avoiding systemwide failure: When good ideas go bad 

Innovation has, by and large, been a tremendous benefit for society, even though some industries 
have been adversely affected. External tragedies, on the other hand—as we have seen, for 
example, in the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine—have the power to disrupt economies. 
But many sector- and economy-wide failures have been self-inflicted. 

Poor economic outcomes have directly followed when good or well-intentioned business ideas 
were taken too far. In the past 20 years, three ideas in particular that were good in principle—until 
they clashed with the fundamentals of finance and economics—were responsible for major 
market losses and economic recessions. 

The first idea was to move rapidly in a “new economy”: if companies can catch an early tech-
nological wave, positive results will follow. There is no doubt that being an early mover can be a 
very good idea and can confer benefits such as network effects. But merely taking up space  
on a new frontier does not necessarily mean that a company can sustain (or even achieve) attractive 
returns on its cost of capital. It certainly does not mean that traditional value-creating principles 
will no longer apply or that the economics will eventually come through. 

In the late 19th century, for example, the United States experienced a railroad boom; tens of 
thousands of miles of track were laid, often with obvious and significant redundancies. Investors 
and entrepreneurs put growth in this new technology first: Why miss out? It was a period of fund

its cost of capital.

and fund, build and build—until it all went bust in 1894, ushering in a major economic depression. 
Of course, the bust did not result in the end of railroads. On the contrary: visionary thinkers went 
on to run the smarter, more rationalized railways that unleashed massive growth across the 
economy in the early 20th century. These thinkers understood the railroad business, recognized 
the levers of value creation, and could more clearly see and capture the possibilities. 

History repeats, or at least rhymes, as the internet and the dot-com bubble show. We remember 
the mantra that the World Wide Web would “change everything.” As the market in the late  
1990s and early 2000s became increasingly frothy, very smart people confidently asserted that 
the rules of economics and finance had changed. The popular 1999 book Information Rules  
by Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian describes how some companies can earn increasing returns to 
scale. As these companies get bigger, the book explains, they earn higher margins and returns  
on capital. The authors also specifically described how rare it is for companies to realize 
efficiencies in this way. 

But new-economy proponents—some may not have read the book at all—touted a winner- 
take-all world where staking out a place in the ether was all that mattered. This simplistic view 
imagined that the laws of economics were suspended. The zeitgeist, fueled by sky-high 
valuations, led some companies to create and expand dot-com businesses at all costs. Many 
investors and managers lost sight of the fundamentals.5 This was a bubble doomed to pop. 

After it did, the internet, like railroads more than a century before, became a source of 
enormous, and far more enduring, value creation—and an enabler of broader economic growth. 
Successful entrepreneurs did the hard, detail-oriented work of analyzing the specific 
circumstances in which enormous value creation was possible. These entrepreneurs created 
value-sustaining businesses, which generated returns far above their cost of capital. 

5  The lack of perfect liquidity in the capital markets can lead to distortions or bubbles. In particular, when naïve investors rush into 

certain stocks simply because they are the latest fad and everyone else is investing in them, they push up the price beyond 
intrinsic value. Further exacerbating this effect is the presence of “trading investors” who bet that the trend will continue and that 
when the stock plateaus and turns down to reasonable levels, they will exit their positions and lock in the profits before naïve or 
slow investors can. Finally, other institutional investors may buy shares because they worry about their tracking error versus the 
stock market indexes. It might be supposed that smart investors would step in and sell the shares short to bring the share price  
in line with fundamentals. But shorting is expensive, illiquid, and risky, so there often isn’t enough of it to keep a share price in line 
with intrinsic value. 

8

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionA second idea that can be taken too far is that size alone provides a competitive advantage. Of 
course, size matters—but only if size befits a company’s business model. Regrettably, the idea 
that size is an end in itself has occurred across industries, geographies, and eras. One illustration 
of this is electric-power generation in the United States. In the late 1990s, as a number of 
states deregulated power generation, multiple US electric-utility companies spun off their power 
gener ation units so they could raise more capital and grow faster. They were spurred on by some  
who argued that the biggest power generators would create the most value. Some companies 
pursued more thoughtful strategies than others. But in their rush for size, several companies ended 
up with a diverse collection of power plants across the United States—and sometimes across  
the globe—with few strategic benefits (and a large pile of debt). The rush for size also contributed 
to overcapacity in the industry as a whole. Overcapacity and commodity price changes led  
to lower returns for power producers. Some large producers, especially those without coherent 
strategies and competitive advantages, as well as with high debt levels, ended up in bankruptcy.

A third idea that was good until taken too far—with significant repercussions for millions of 
people—was securitizing mortgage debt. Bundling individual mortgage loans, turning them into 
securities, and then selling the securities to investors was certainly innovative. But the practice 
was taken to such an extreme that it led to the financial crisis of 2008. Many have focused on what 
could have been done to mitigate the crisis once it started. History has shown, though, that  
most financial crises are caused by imbalances in the allocation of economic resources. Once the 
imbalances become too large, it can be exceptionally difficult to avert a collapse. 

By 2005–06, a financial crisis was virtually inevitable. Banks, enabled by their ability to package 
and sell mortgage-backed securities, were lending too much money to too many people, who were 
buying too many houses. Mortgages, including a rising number of subprime mortgages, could be 
repaid only if property prices continued to rise at abnormal rates for an unsustainably long time. 
Also, when mortgage-backed bonds were first issued, the buyers were sophisticated investors 
who spent considerable effort analyzing the underlying portfolios. As the bonds became more 
popular, however, they were purchased by less sophisticated investors who did not do their  
own research; many relied on bond-rating agencies. These agencies were in competition with 
one another and were paid by the issuers of the mortgage-backed bonds. They were thus  
under tremendous pressure to give the bonds high credit ratings. Other investors relied on the 
fact that the mortgages were being pooled—normally, a way to mitigate risk. Bad mortgages, 
though, are still bad mortgages. Bundling them together, selling them to less diligent investors, 
and relying on home prices to rise forever reaped the whirlwind. 

Of course, innovation can’t come from “the same old ideas.” Questions about how far is too far 
are bound to arise, at least initially. New theories are already shedding light on the disruptive 
potential of block chain (including its use in cryptocurrencies) and the ways that businesses could 
be transformed in the metaverse. Another idea now in contention is the sustainability of low 
interest rates and the attendant risks of inflation. After the 2008 financial crisis, and again after 

9

Reflections on 20 years of McKinsey on Finance—and three challenges aheadthe magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic became clear, central banks pushed down interest 
rates through various mechanisms, including purchasing large amounts of government bonds. 
This has allowed governments to borrow vast sums of money at very low rates, which, not 
surprisingly, has led to a surge in spending and larger government deficits. 

The question today is whether lower interest rates—even given the recent rise—will be the new 
normal, enabling governments to run larger deficits. One side argues that the world has changed: 
central banks can keep interest rates relatively low, so governments can keep borrowing to 
finance initiatives such as social spending and climate action. The other side argues that once 
government debt rises too high, it’s almost impossible to contain inflation, especially when 
borrowing is facilitated by central banks printing money. Both ground their hypotheses in 
economics; the future will have the final say. 

3

 Competing under climate change: Capital is not enough 

A third major development of the past 20 years is the sharpening awareness of climate change 
and the dramatic shifts this has brought to regulation, capital allocation, and consumer behavior. 
Climate change threatens the world. It creates enormous challenges—and tackling it opens  
up enormous opportunities. Across industries and sectors, climate change is a clarion call for 
innovation and for the reallocation of resources. Our colleagues at the McKinsey Global  
Institute estimate that to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, $9.2 trillion in annual average 
spending on physical assets—$3.5 trillion more than today—would be required.6

Entrepreneurs and companies that seek to create value from less carbon-intensive businesses, 
however, will need a competitive advantage; simply having capital to invest or reallocate will not 
be enough to compete and win in a net-zero world. Today, private equity, venture capital, pension 
funds, and sovereign-wealth funds are investing billions of dollars in renewable energy, alternative 

Companies that seek to create value 
from less carbon-intensive businesses 
will need a competitive advantage; 
simply having capital to invest or 
reallocate will not be enough.

company from a traditional industry will have the expertise, incentives, employee capabilities, 
and organizational agility to be in the vanguard in these fields. Companies that plan to compete in 
the net-zero transition must figure out how they can be the visionaries that best understand  
the new businesses, rather than be the followers that don’t have a well-considered strategy or 
the ones who entirely ignore the imperative to change. 

As the economy shifts from fossil fuels to renewables and other sources of energy, companies  
in sectors such as oil and gas, chemicals, and mining should think carefully about how to  
manage the decline of their traditional businesses. Moving away from their core businesses 
requires careful consideration of the impact for stakeholders and a thoughtful approach  
to navigating through challenging competitive forces. If, after frank consideration, companies 
determine that they cannot reinvest their excess cash flows in technologies in which they  
can have a competitive advantage, they can release that unused cash back to their investors.  
In that way, the money can flow to those who do have a competitive advantage in new value-
creating low-carbon solutions. 

The complexities and the possibilities of the net-zero transition are enormous. They are not 
enormous enough, however, to bend the laws of finance and economics. Forgetting core principles 
of competitive advantage and the need to earn returns above the cost of capital bodes ill for the 
sustainability of companies, the livelihoods of their employees, the investors (on behalf of millions 
of people) whose funds are at risk, and a multitude of constituencies worldwide. 

It would be simplistic to say that enormous challenges lie before us, even when those  
challenges include developing innovation from within, comprehending new ideas, and navigating 
businesses through existential climate change. It is more correct to recognize that those 
challenges are already here. Fortunately, so too are the time-proven principles of finance and 
economics—includ ing the need to pursue change relentlessly, the imperative to seek  
competitive advantage, and the foundational requirement to understand one’s business in  
order to create value, societal as well as economic, from the opportunities for sustainable, 
inclusive growth.

Fundamentals  
of strategy and 
value creation

Think back to the titans of industry in the late-19th 
and early-20th centuries in the United States, and 
you are likely to think of empire builders such as 
Cornelius Vanderbilt, Andrew Carnegie, and John D. 
Rockefeller. Also high on the list of the greatest 
tycoons during those years is Henrietta (Hetty) 
Howland Robinson Green. 

Green built an immense fortune worth billions in 
today’s dollars by shrewd investing. She zeroed  
in on cash flow, kept her nerve, stayed ahead of  
rivals, and profited immensely during downturns  
and crises, such as the Great Panic of 1907. Yet  
she didn’t make her money by chasing bigness— 
at least not for bigness’s sake. “There is a price  
on everything I have,” she said. “When that price is  
offered, I sell.”

Core principles of disciplined value creation—
knowing an asset’s intrinsic value, understanding  
a company’s competitive advantage, and not 
fearing to take bold steps—continue to hold true. 
Companies that allocate and continually reallocate 
capital to areas in which they hold a competitive 
advantage demonstrably outperform companies 
that stand still. Businesses that aren’t afraid to 
grow but understand that growth should never 
destroy value stand a better chance of creating 
more value for the long term. Their leaders are alert  
to broader business trends and strive to anticipate 
them. But they don’t fall for flavors of the month, 
set about to build empires, or forget that companies 
that grow sustainably and earn returns above their 
cost of capital create the most value. 

That’s been proven across eras, from Hetty Green’s 
time to our own. But then, fundamentals of strategy 
and finance have always been about the long term.

How to put your money 
where your strategy is

Most companies allocate the same resources to the same business units 
year after year. That makes it difficult to create an effective corporate 
strategy and undermines performance. Here’s how to overcome inertia.

opportunity to another. In fact, after 15 years, 
company B will be worth an average of 40 percent 
more than company A. 

We also found, though, that inertia reigns at the vast 
majority of companies—those that resemble 
company A. Therein lies a major disconnect between 
the aspirations of many corporate strategists to 
boldly jettison unattractive businesses or double 
down on exciting new opportunities, and the  
reality of how they invest capital, talent, and other 
scarce resources.

We’re not suggesting that executives act as invest-
ment portfolio managers. That implies a search  
for stand-alone returns at any cost rather than 
purposeful decisions that enhance a corporation’s 
overall long-term value and strategic coherence.  
But given the prevalence of stasis today, most 
organizations are a long way from the headlong 
pursuit of disconnected opportunities. Rather,  
many leaders face a stark choice: shift resources 
among their businesses to realize strategic goals  
or run the risk that the market will do it for them. As 
author and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner 
Randy Komisar told us, “If corporations don’t 
approach rebalancing as fiduciaries for long-term 
corporate value, their average life span will  
continue to decline as creative destruction gets the 
better of them.”

Picture two global companies, each operating a 
range of different businesses. Company A allocates 
capital, talent, and research dollars consistently 
every year, making small changes but always follow-
ing the same broad investment pattern. Company B 
continually evaluates the performance of business 
units, acquires and divests assets, and adjusts 
resource allocations based on each division’s relative 
market opportunities. Over time, which company  
will be worth more?

If you guessed company B, you’re right. Our research 
into corporate resource-allocation patterns finds

of falling into bankruptcy or the hands of an acquirer 
lower—at companies where capital and other 
resources flow more readily from one business

Weighing the evidence
Every year for the past quarter century, US capital 
markets have issued about $85 billion of equity and 
$536 billion in associated corporate debt. During 
the same period, the amount of capital allocated  
or reallocated within multibusiness companies was 
approximately $640 billion annually—more than 
equity and corporate debt combined.1 While most 
perceive markets as the primary means of directing 
capital and recycling assets across industries, 
companies with multiple businesses actually play a 
bigger role in allocating capital and other resources 
across a spectrum of economic opportunities.

To understand how effectively corporations are 
moving their resources, we reviewed the perfor-
mance of more than 1,600 US companies between 
1990 and 2005.2 The results were striking. For one-
third of the businesses in our sample, the amount  
of capital received in a given year was almost exactly 
that received the year before—the mean correlation 
was 0.99. For the economy as a whole, the mean 
correlation across all industries was 0.92. In fact, over 
the entire 15-year period, only one-third of companies 
shifted more than 40 percent of their capital 
resources among their businesses; the bottom third 
shifted an average of just 10 percent.

In other words, the enormous amount of strategic 
planning in corporations seems to result, on the 
whole, in only modest resource shifts. Whether the 
relevant resource is capital expenditures, operating 
expenditures, or human capital, this finding is 
consistent across industries as diverse as mining  
and consumer packaged goods. Given the 
performance edge associated with higher levels of 
reallocation, such static behavior is almost certainly 
not sensible. Our research showed the following:

 — Companies that reallocated more resources—the 
top third of our sample, shifting an average of  
56 percent of capital across business units over 
the entire 15-year period—earned, on average, 
30 percent higher total shareholder returns (TSR) 
annually than companies in the bottom third of 
the sample. This result was surprisingly consistent 
across all sectors of the economy. It seems  
that when companies disproportionately invest 
in value-creating businesses, they generate  
a mutually reinforcing cycle of growth and further 
investment options (exhibit).

 — Consistent and incremental reallocation  

levels diminished the variability of returns over 
the long term.

2  We used Compustat data on 1,616 US-listed companies with operations in a minimum of two distinct four-digit Standard Industrial Classification 
codes. Resource allocation is measured as 1 minus the minimum percentage of capital expenditure received by distinct business units over the 
15-year period. This measure captures the relative amount of capital that can flow across a business over time; the rest of the money is “stuck.” 
Similar results were found with more sophisticated measures that control for sales and asset growth. 

15

How to put your money where your strategy is —  A company in the top third of active reallocators 
was, on average, 13 percent more likely to avoid 
acquisition or bankruptcy than low reallocators. 

 — Over an average six-year tenure, chief executives 
who reallocated less than their peers in the first 
three years on the job were significantly more 
likely than their more active peers to be removed 
in years four through six. To paraphrase the 
philosopher Thomas Hobbes, tenure for static 
CEOs is likely to be nasty, brutish, and, above  
all, short.

We should note the importance of a long-term view: 
over time spans of less than three years, companies 
that reallocated higher levels of resources delivered 
lower shareholder returns than their more stable 
peers did. One explanation for this pattern could be 
risk aversion on the part of investors, who are  
initially cautious about major corporate capital shifts 
and then recognize value only once the results 
become visible. Another factor could be the deep 
interconnection of resource-allocation choices  
with corporate strategy. The goal is not to make 
dramatic changes every year but to reallocate 
resources consistently over the medium to long term 
in service of a clear corporate strategy. That 
provides the time necessary for new investments  
to flourish, for established businesses to maximize  
their potential, and for capital from declining 
investments to be redeployed effectively. Given the 
richness and complexity of the issues at play  
here, differences in the relationship between short-  
and long-term resource shifts and financial 
performance are likely to be a fruitful area for  
further research.

Overcoming inertia
The failure to pursue a more active allocation agenda 
is a result of organizational inertia that has multiple 
causes, often related to cognitive biases3 or political 
wrangling. Or as one CEO told us, “If you’re asking 
me to play Robin Hood, that’s not going to work.”

Regardless of the source, inertia’s gravitational pull 
is strong—and overcoming it is critical to creating  
an effective corporate strategy. As tempting as it is to 
believe that one’s own company avoids these traps, 
our research suggests that’s unlikely. Our experience 
also suggests, though, that taking steps such  
as those described below can materially improve a 
company’s resource allocation and its connection  
to strategic priorities. 

1.  Have a target corporate portfolio
When it comes to developing an allocation agenda, it 
is helpful to have a target portfolio in mind. Most 
companies shy away from this, for understandable 
reasons: it requires a lot of conviction to describe 
planned portfolio changes in anything but the 
vaguest terms, and the right answers may change if 
the broader business environment turns out to be 
different from the expected one. In our experience, 
though, a target portfolio need not be slavish or 
mechanistic and can be a powerful forcing device to 
move beyond generic strategy statements, such as 
“strengthen in Asian markets” or “continue to migrate 
from products to services.” Identifying business 
opportunities where your company wants to increase 
its exposure can create a foundation for scrutinizing 
how it allocates capital, talent, and other resources. 
For example, Kjell Aamot, a former CEO of 
Scandinavian media company Schibsted, says its 
evolution from a print- to digital-media leader means 
that “if you look at [our] strategy and investment 
allocation today, more or less 100 percent goes into 
online activities.” That’s a shift in focus that took 
several years to effect. 

Evaluating reallocation performance relative to 
peers also can help companies set targets. From 
1990 to 2009, for example, Honeywell reallocated 
about 25 percent of its capital as it shifted  
away from some existing business areas toward 
aerospace, air-conditioning, and controls. 
Honeywell’s competitor Danaher, which was in 
similar businesses in 1990, moved 66 percent  
of its capital into new ones during the same period. 

3  For more on cognitive biases, see, for example, Dan Lovallo and Olivier Sibony, “The case for behavioral strategy,” McKinsey Quarterly,  

March 1, 2010.

16

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionBoth companies achieved returns above the 
industry average in these years—TSR for Honeywell 
was 14 percent and for Danaher 25 percent. We’re 
not suggesting that companies adopt a mindset of 
“more is better, and if my competitor is making big 
moves, I should too.” But differences in allocation 
levels among peer companies can serve as  
valuable clues about contrasting business 
approaches—clues that prompt questions that can 
yield strategic insights. 

2. Use all resource-reallocation tools  
at your disposal
Talking about resource allocation in broad terms 
oversimplifies the choices facing senior executives. 
In reality, allocation comprises four fundamental 
activities: seeding, nurturing, pruning, and harvesting. 
Seeding is entering new business areas, whether 
through an acquisition or an organic start-up 
investment. Nurturing involves building up an existing 
business through follow-on investments, including 
bolt-on acquisitions. Pruning takes resources away 
from an existing business, either by giving some  
of its annual capital allocation to others or by putting 

a portion of the business up for sale. Finally, 
harvesting is selling whole businesses that no  
longer fit a company’s portfolio or undertaking 
equity spin-offs.

Our research found that there’s little overall differ-
ence between the seeding and harvesting behavior 
of low and high reallocators. This should come as 
little surprise: seeding involves giving money to new 
business opportunities—something that’s rarely 
resisted. And while harvesting is difficult, it most 
often occurs as a result of a business unit’s 
sustained underperformance, which is difficult  
to ignore. 

However, we found a 170 percent difference in 
activity levels between high and low reallocators 
when it came to the combination of nurturing  
and pruning existing businesses. Together, these 
two represent half of all corporate reallocation 
activity. Both are difficult because they often involve 
taking resources from one business unit and giving 
them to another. What’s more, the better a company 
is at encouraging seeding, the more important 

The better a company is at encouraging 
seeding, the more important nurturing 
and pruning become—nurturing  
to ensure the success of new initiatives, 
and pruning to eliminate flowers that 
will not ever bloom.

believed were exciting growth opportunities, without 
first having to go through a “pruning” fight with the 
company’s executive-leadership committee.

3. Adopt simple decision rules to break  
the status quo
Simple rules can help minimize political infighting 
because they change the burden of proof from  
the typical default allocation (“what we did last year”) 
to one that makes it impossible to maintain the 
status quo. For example, a simple harvesting rule 
might involve putting a certain percentage of  
an organization’s portfolio up for sale each year to 
maintain vibrancy and to cull dead wood.

Of course, the CEO and other senior leaders will 
need to reinforce discipline around such simple 
allocation rules; it’s not easy to hold the line in the 
face of special pleading from less favored 
businesses. Developing that level of clarity—not to 
mention the courage to fight tough battles that  
arise as a result—often requires support in the form 
of a strong corporate center or a strategic-planning 
group that is independent of competing business 
interests and can provide objective information. 

When Lee Raymond was CEO of Exxon Mobil, for 
example, he required the corporate-planning  
team to identify 3 to 5 percent of the company’s 
assets for potential disposal every year. Exxon 
Mobil’s business divisions were allowed to retain 
assets placed in this group only if they could 
demonstrate a tangible and compelling turnaround 
program. In essence, the burden on the business 
units was to prove that an asset should be retained, 
rather than the other way around. The net effect  
was accelerated portfolio upgrading and healthy 
turnover in the face of executives’ natural desire to 
hang on to underperforming assets. Another 
approach we’ve observed involves placing existing 
businesses into different categories—such as  
“grow,” “maintain,” and “dispose”—and then following 
clearly differentiated resource-investment rules  
for each. The purpose of having clear investment 
rules for each category of business is to remove as 
much politics as possible from the resource-
allocation process.

Sometimes, the CEO may want a way to stimulate 
resource reallocations directly, in parallel with 
regular corporate processes. One natural-resources 
company, for example, gave its CEO sole discretion 
to allocate 5 percent of the company’s capital outside 
the traditional bottom-up annual capital-allocation 
process. This provided an opportunity to move the 
organization more quickly toward what the CEO 

4. Implement corporate processes to  
mitigate inertia
Systematic processes can strengthen resource-
allocation activities. One approach, explored  
in detail by our colleagues Sven Smit and Patrick 
Viguerie, is to create planning and management 
processes that generate a granular view of a 
company’s product and market opportunities.4 The 
overwhelming tendency is for corporate leaders to 
allocate resources at a level that is too high—namely, 
by division or business unit. When senior manage-
ment does not have a granular view, division leaders 
can use their information advantage to average  
out allocations within their domains.

Another approach is to revisit a company’s 
businesses periodically and engage in a process 
similar to the due diligence conducted for 
investments. Executives at one energy conglomerate 
annually ask whether they would choose to invest in  
a business if they didn’t already own it. If the 
answer is no, a discussion about whether and how 
to exit the business begins.

Executives can further strengthen allocation deci-
sions by creating objectivity through reanchoring—
that is, giving the allocation an objective basis  
that is independent of both the numbers the business 
units provide and the previous year’s allocation. 
There are numerous ways to create such independent, 

4  See three publications by Mehrdad Baghai, Sven Smit, and Patrick Viguerie: “The granularity of growth,” McKinsey Quarterly, May 1, 2007;  

The Granularity of Growth: How to Identify the Sources of Growth and Drive Enduring Company Performance, Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2008; and 
“Is your growth strategy flying blind?,” Harvard Business Review, May 2009, Volume 87, Number 5.

18

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionfact-based anchors, including deriving targets from 
market-growth and market-share data or leveraging 
a benchmarking analysis of competitors. The goal  
is to create an objective way to ask business leaders 
this tough question: “If we were to triangulate 
between these different approaches, we would 
expect your investments and returns to lie  
within the following range. Why are your estimates 
so much higher (or lower)?” 

Finally, it’s worth noting that technology is enabling 
strategy-process innovations that stir the pot 
through internal discussions and “crowdsourcing.” 
For example, Rite-Solutions, a Rhode Island–based 
company that builds advanced software for the  
US Navy, defense contractors, and first responders, 
derives 20 percent of its revenue from businesses 
identified through a “stock exchange” where 
employees can propose and invest in new ideas.

Much of our advice for overcoming inertia within 
multibusiness companies assumes that a 
corporation’s interests are not the same as the 
cumulative resource demands of the underlying 
divisions and businesses. As they say, turkeys  
do not vote for Christmas. Putting in place some 
combination of the targets, rules, and processes 
proposed here may require rethinking the role  
and inner workings of a company’s strategic and 
financial-planning teams. Although we recognize  
that this is not a trivial endeavor, the rewards make 
the effort worthwhile. A primary performance 
imperative for corporate-level executives should  
be to escape the tyranny of inertia and create  
more dynamic portfolios over time.

Balancing ROIC and 
growth to build value

Companies find growth enticing, but a strong return on invested capital is 
more sustainable.

wisdom, investors recognize (and will pay more for) 
the anticipated returns of companies with a strong 
ROIC, despite their limited growth prospects. This 
observation doesn’t mean that growth is undesirable; 
unless companies keep up with their industries,  
they will likely destroy value. But they shouldn’t 
pursue growth heroically at the expense of improve-
ments in ROIC.

After identifying the largest publicly listed compa-
nies in the United States (by revenues) in 1965, 1975, 
1985, and 1995, we examined their long-term 
patterns of growth and ROIC.1 The median ROIC for 
the 1965 group remained stable, at about 9 percent, 
over the next 40 years. We observed the same 
pattern for the groups from 1975, 1985, and 1995. In 
other words, ROIC tends to remain stable over time.

Growth, by contrast, is fleeting. The median 
inflation-adjusted growth in revenues for the top 
500 companies in 1965 started out at 7 percent  
and steadily declined to 2 percent over the next  
10 years, hitting a cyclical low of 0 percent by  
year 17. For the next 20 years, growth hovered at 
around 2 percent—a figure below the level of  
US GDP growth.2 We observed a similar general 
pattern of decay in median real growth for the top  
500 companies in 1975, 1985, and 1995.

Growth might be the lifeblood of a business, but it 
isn’t always the best or most sustainable way to 
create value for shareholders. Return on invested 
capital (ROIC) is often just as important—and 
occasionally even more so—as a measure of value 
creation and can be easier to sustain at a high level.

When a company’s ROIC is already high, growth 
typically generates additional value. But if a 
company’s ROIC is low, executives can create more 
value by boosting ROIC than by pursuing growth 
(exhibit). A close look at companies with high price-
to-earnings multiples shows that many have 
extraordinary returns on capital but limited growth. 
This scrutiny suggests that, contrary to conventional

Moreover, pattern analysis at the industry3 level 
further shows the importance of managing ROIC. A 
comparison of ROIC4 for the top 500 companies  
of 1965 shows that it remained steady in most 
sectors and even increased in some—particularly 
those with strong brands or patent-protected 
products (household and personal goods, for 
example) and pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. 
Growth, by contrast, almost always declined,  
except in pharmaceuticals.

A close examination of individual companies finds 
similar patterns; companies with high levels of ROIC 
tend to hold on to that advantage, whereas high-
growth companies rarely do. We looked at the 
proba bility that a company will migrate from one level 
of ROIC to another over the course of a decade.  
A company that generated an ROIC of less than  

5 percent in 1994, for instance, had a 43 percent 
chance of earning less than 5 percent in 2003. We 
found that low and high performers alike demon-
strate consistency throughout the 40-year period. 
Companies with an ROIC of 5 to 10 percent had a  
40 percent probability of remaining in the same group 
ten years later; companies with an ROIC of more 
than 20 percent had a 50 percent probability.

But when it comes to growth, companies are very 
likely to experience substantial declines. Of 
companies that grew by more than 20 percent in 
1994, for example, 56 percent were growing at  
real rates of less than 5 percent ten years later. Only 
13 percent of the high-growth companies main-
tained 20 percent real growth ten years on, and 
acquisitions probably drove most of it.

Strategy to beat the odds

If you internalize the real odds of strategy, you can tame its social side and 
make big moves.

by Chris Bradley, Martin Hirt, and Sven Smit

In our book, Strategy Beyond the Hockey Stick (John 
Wiley & Sons, February 2018), we set out to help 
companies unlock the big moves needed to beat the 
odds. Another strategy framework? No, we already 
have plenty of those. Rather, we need to address the 
real problem: the “social side of strategy,” arising 
from corporate politics, individual incentives, and 
human biases. How? With evidence. We examined 
publicly available information on dozens of  
variables for thousands of companies and found a 
manageable number of levers that explain more  
than 80 percent of the up-drift and down-drift in 
corporate performance. That data can help you 
assess your strategy’s odds of success before you 
leave the strategy room, much less start to  
execute the plan.

Such an assessment stands in stark contrast to the 
norms prevailing in most strategy rooms, where 
discussion focuses on comparisons with last year, 
on immediate competitors, and on expectations  
for the year ahead. There is also precious little room 
for uncertainty, for exploration of the world beyond 
the experience of the people in the room, or for bold 
strategies embracing big moves that can deliver  
a strong performance jolt. The result? Incremental 
improvements that leave companies merely playing 
along with the rest of their industries. 

Common as that outcome is, it isn’t a necessary one. 
If you understand the social side of strategy, the 
odds of strategy revealed by our research, and the 
power of making big moves, you will dramatically 
increase your chances of success.

Several times a year, top management teams enter 
the strategy room with lofty goals and the best  
of intentions: they hope to honestly assess their 
situation and prospects, and mount a decisive, 
coordinated response toward a common ambition. 

Then reality intrudes. By the time they get to the 
strategy room, they find it is already crowded with 
egos and competing agendas. Jobs—even  
careers—are on the line, so caution reigns. The 
budget process intervenes, too. You may be 
discussing a five-year strategy, but everyone knows 
that what really matters is the first-year budget.  
So, many managers try to secure resources for the 
coming year while deferring other tough choices  
as far as possible into the future. One outcome of  
these dynamics is the hockey-stick projection, 
confidently showing future success after the all-too-
familiar dip in next year’s budget. If we had to choose 
an emblem for strategic planning, this would be it.

22

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Edition 
 
The social side of strategy 
Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman described in his 
book Thinking, Fast and Slow (Farrar, Straus and 
Giroux, 2011) the “inside view” that often emerges 
when we focus only on the case at hand. This  
view leads people to extrapolate from their own 
experiences and data, even when they are 
attempting something they’ve never done before. 
The inside view also is vulnerable to contamination 
by overconfidence and other cognitive biases,  
as well as by internal politics. 

It’s well known by now that people are prone to a 
wide range of biases, such as anchoring, loss 
aversion, confirmation bias, and attribution error. 
While these unintentional mental shortcuts help  
us filter information in our daily lives, they distort the 
outcomes when we are forced to make big, 
consequential decisions infrequently and under high 
uncertainty—exactly the types of decisions we 
confront in the strategy room. When you bring 
together people with shared experiences and goals, 
they wind up telling themselves stories, generally 
favorable ones. A study found, for instance, that  
80 percent of executives believe their product stands 
out against the competition—but only 8 percent of 
customers agree.1

Then, add agency problems, and the strategy 
process creates a veritable petri dish for all sorts of 
dysfunctions to grow.2 Presenters seeking to get 
that all-important “yes” to their plans may define 
market share so it excludes geographies or 
segments where their business units are weak, or 
attribute weak performance to one-off events  
such as weather, restructuring efforts, or a regulatory 
change. Executives argue for a large resource 
allotment in the full knowledge that they will get 
negotiated down to half of that. Egos, careers, 
bonuses, and status in the organization all depend to 
a large extent on how convincingly people present 
their strategies and the prospects of their business. 

That’s why people often “sandbag” to avoid risky 
moves and make triple sure they can hit their targets. 
Or they play the short game, focusing on performance 
in the next couple of years in the knowledge that 
they likely won’t be running their division afterward. 
Emblematic of these strategy-room dynamics is  
the hockey-stick presentation. Hockey sticks recur 
with alarming frequency, as the experience of a 
multinational company demonstrates. The company 
planned for a breakout in 2011, only to achieve flat 
results. Undeterred, the team drew another hockey 
stick for 2012, then 2013, then 2014, then 2015, 

If you understand the social side of 
strategy, the odds of strategy revealed 
by our research, and the power of 
making big moves, you will dramatically 
increase your chances of success.

Strategy to beat the odds

even as actual results stayed roughly flat, then 
trailed off. 

To move beyond hockey sticks and the social forces 
that cause them, the CEO and the board need an 
objective, external benchmark.

The odds of strategy
The starting point for developing such a benchmark 
is embracing the fact that business strategy, at  
its heart, is about beating the market; that is, defying 
the power of “perfect” markets to push economic 
surplus to zero. Economic profit—the total profit after 
the cost of capital is subtracted—measures the 
success of that defiance by showing what is left  

after the forces of competition have played out. 
From 2010 to 2014, the average company in our 
database of the world’s 2,393 largest corporations 
reported $920 million in annual operating profit.  
To make this profit, they used $9.3 billion of invested 
capital,3 which earned a return of 9.9 percent. After 
investors and lenders took 8 percent to compensate 
for use of their funds, that left $180 million in 
economic profit.

Plotting each company’s average economic profit 
demonstrates a power law—the tails of the curve 
rise and fall at exponential rates, with long flatlands 
in the middle (exhibit). The power curve reveals a 
number of important insights:

exceed the cost of capital by almost two 
percentage points, but the market is chipping 
away at those profits. That brutal competition is 
why you struggle just to stay in place. For 
companies in the middle of the power curve, the 
market takes a heavy toll. Companies in those 
three quintiles delivered economic profits 
averaging just $47 million a year. 

 — The curve is extremely steep at the bookends. 
Companies in the top quintile capture nearly  
90 percent of the economic profit created, 
averaging $1.4 billion annually. In fact, those in 
the top quintile average some 30 times as  
much economic profit as those in the middle 
three quintiles, while the bottom 20 percent 
suffer deep economic losses. That unevenness 
exists within the top quintile, too. The top  
2 percent together earn about as much as the 
next 8 percent combined. At the other end  
of the curve, the undersea canyon of negative 
economic profit is deep—though not quite as 
deep as the mountain is high. 

 — The curve is getting steeper. Back in 2000 to 
2004, companies in the top quintile captured  
a collective $186 billion in economic profit. Fast 
forward a decade and the top quintile earned 
$684 billion. A similar pattern emerges in the 
bottom quintile. Since investors seek out 
companies that offer market-beating returns, 
capital tends to flow to the top, no matter the 
geographic or industry boundaries. Companies 
that started in the top quintile ten years earlier 
soaked up 50 cents of every dollar of new capital 
in the decade up to 2014. 

 — Size isn’t everything, but it isn’t nothing, either. 

Economic profit reflects the strength of a strategy 
based not only on the power of its economic 
formula (measured by the spread of its returns 
over its cost of capital) but also on how  
scalable that formula is (measured by how much 
invested capital it could deploy). Compare 
Walmart, with a moderate 12 percent return on 
capital but a whopping $136.0 billion of invested 

capital, with Starbucks, which has a huge  
50 percent return on capital but is limited by 
being in a much less scalable category, deploying 
only $2.6 billion of invested capital. They both 
generated enormous value, but the difference in 
economic profit is substantial: $5.3 billion for 
Walmart versus $1.1 billion for Starbucks. 

 — Industry matters, a lot. Our analysis shows that 

about 50 percent of your position on the curve is 
driven by your industry—highlighting just how 
critical the “where to play” choice is in strategy. 
Industry performance also follows a power curve, 
with the same hanging tail and high leading  
peak. There are 12 tobacco companies in our 
research, and nine are in the top quintile.  
Yet there are 20 paper companies, and none are 
in the top quintile. The role of industry in  
a company’s position on the power curve is so 
substantial that it’s better to be an average 
company in a great industry than a great company 
in an average industry. 

 — Mobility is possible—but rare. Here is a number 
that’s worth mulling: the odds of a company 
moving from the middle quintiles of the power 
curve to the top quintile over a ten-year  
period are 8 percent. That means just one in  
12 companies makes such a leap. These  
odds are sobering, but they also encourage you 
to set a high bar: Is your strategy better than  
the 92 percent of other strategies?

The power of big moves
What can you do to improve the odds that your 
company will move up the power curve? The answer 
is lurking in our data. Consider this analogy: to 
estimate a person’s income, we can start with the 
global average, or about $15,000 per year. If  
we know that the person is American, our estimate 
jumps to the average US per capita income, or 
$56,000. If we know that the individual is a 55-year-
old male, the estimate jumps to $64,500. If that  
guy works in the IT industry, it jumps to $86,000. 
And if we know the person is Bill Gates, well,  
it’s a lot more than that.

Strategy to beat the odds

25

Adding ever more information similarly helps to zero 
in on the probabilities of corporate success. Even if 
you know your overall odds, you need to understand 
which of your attributes and actions can best help 
you raise them. We identified ten performance levers 
and, importantly, how strongly you have to pull them 
to make a real difference in your strategy’s success. 
We divided these levers into three categories: 
endowment, trends, and moves. Your endowment is 
what you start with, and the variables that matter 
most are your revenue (size), debt level (leverage), 
and past investment in R&D (innovation). Trends  
are the winds that are pushing you along, hitting you 
in the face, or buffeting you from the side. The  
key variables there are your industry trend and your 
exposure to growth geographies. In analyzing  
the odds of moving on the power curve, we found 
that endowment determines about 30 percent  
and trends another 25 percent. 

The moves that matter
However, it is your moves—what you do with your 
endowment and how you respond to trends—that 
make the biggest difference. Our research found 
that the following five moves, pursued persistently, 
can get you to where you want to go: 

 — Programmatic M&A. You need a steady stream 
of deals every year, each amounting to no more 
than 30 percent of your market cap but adding 
over ten years to at least 30 percent of your 
market cap. Corning, which over the course of a 

decade moved from the bottom to the top 
quintile of the power curve, shows the value of 
disciplined M&A. Corning understands that 
doing three deals a year means it must maintain 
a steady pipeline of potential targets, conduct 
due diligence on 20 companies, and submit about 
five bids. 

 — Dynamic reallocation of resources. Winning 

companies reallocate capital expenditures at  
a healthy clip, feeding the units that could 
produce a major move up the power curve while 
starving those unlikely to surge. The threshold 
here is reallocating at least 50 percent of capital 
expenditure among business units over a 
decade. When Frans van Houten became 
Koninklijke Philips’s CEO in 2011, the company 
began divesting itself of legacy assets,  
including its TV and audio businesses. After this 
portfolio restructuring, Philips succeeded at 
reinvigorating its growth engine by reallocating 
resources to more promising businesses  
(oral care and healthcare were two priorities) and 
geographies. Philips started, for example, 
managing performance and resource allocations 
at the level of more than 340 business-market 
combinations, such as power toothbrushes in 
China and respiratory care in Germany. That led 
to an acceleration of growth, with the consumer 
business moving from the company’s worst-
performing segment to its best-performing one 
within five years. 

Even if you know your overall odds, you 
need to understand which of your 
attributes and actions can best help you 
raise them.

26

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Edition — Strong capital expenditure. You meet the bar  

on this lever if you are among the top 20 percent 
in your industry in your ratio of capital spending 
to sales. That typically means spending 1.7 times 
the industry median. Taiwanese semiconductor 
manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufac-
tu ring Company (TSMC) pulled this lever when 
the Internet bubble burst and demand for semi-
conductors dropped sharply. The company 
bought mission-critical equipment at the trough 
and was ready to meet the demand as soon as  
it came back. TSMC had been in a head-to-head 
race before the downturn but pulled clear  
of the competition after it ended because of its 
investment strategy. That laid the foundation  
for TSMC to become one of the largest and most 
successful semiconductor manufacturing pure 
plays in the world. 

 — Strength of the productivity program. This 

means improving productivity at a rate sufficient 
to put you at least in the top 30 percent of your 
industry. Global toy and entertainment company 
Hasbro successfully achieved the top quintile  
of the power curve with a big move in productivity. 
Following a series of performance shortfalls, 
Hasbro consolidated business units and locations, 
invested in automated processing and customer 
self-service, reduced head count, and exited loss-
making business units. The company’s selling, 
general, and administrative expenses as a pro-
portion of sales fell from an average of 42 percent 
to 29 percent within ten years. Sales productivity 
lifted, too—by a lot. Over the decade, Hasbro 
shed more than a quarter of its workforce yet still 
grew revenue by 33 percent. 

 — Improvements in differentiation. For business-
model innovation and pricing advantages to  
raise your chances of moving up the power curve, 
your gross margin needs to reach the top  
30 percent in your industry. German broadcaster 
ProSieben moved to the top quintile of the  
power curve by shifting its model for a new era of 
media. For example, it expanded its addressable 
client base by using a “media for equity” offering 
for customers whose business would significantly 
benefit from mass media but who couldn’t  
afford to pay with cash. Some of ProSieben’s 
innovations were costly, sometimes even 

cannibalizing existing businesses. But, believing 
the industry would move anyway, the company 
decided that experimenting with change was a 
matter of survival first and profitability  
second. ProSieben’s gross margin expanded 
from 16 percent to 53 percent during our 
research period. 

Greater than the sum of the parts 
Big moves are most effective when done in 
combination—and the worse your endowment or 
trends, the more moves you need to make. For 
companies in the middle quintiles, pulling one or  
two of the five levers more than doubles their  
odds of rising into the top quintile, from 8 percent  
to 17 percent. Three big moves boost these  
odds to 47 percent. 

To understand the cumulative power of big moves, 
consider the experience of Precision Castparts Corp. 
(PCC). In 2004, the manufacturer of complex metal 
components and products for the aerospace, power, 
and industrial markets was lumbering along. Its 
endowment was unimpressive, with revenues and 
debt levels in the middle of the pack, and the 
company had not invested heavily in R&D. PCC’s 
geographic exposure was also limited, though  
the aerospace industry experienced enormous 
tailwinds over the following ten years, which  
helped a lot. 

Most important, however, PCC made big moves  
that collectively shifted its odds of reaching the top 
quintile significantly. The company did so by 
surpassing the high-performance thresholds on four 
of the five levers. For mergers, acquisitions, and 
divestments, it combined a high value and large 
volume of deals between 2004 and 2014 through a 
deliberate and regular program of transactions in 
the aerospace and power markets. 

PCC also reallocated 61 percent of its capital 
spending among its three major divisions, while 
managing the rare double feat of both productivity 
and margin improvements—the only aerospace  
and defense company in our sample to do so. While 
nearly doubling its labor productivity, PCC managed 
to reduce its overhead ratio by three percentage 
points. It lifted its gross profit-to-sales ratio from  
27 to 35 percent. 

Strategy to beat the odds

27

The combination of a positive industry trend and 
successful execution of multiple moves makes PCC 
a showcase of a “high odds” strategy and perhaps 
explains why Berkshire Hathaway agreed in 2015 to 
buy PCC for $37.2 billion. Could our model have 
predicted this outcome? Based on the moves PCC 
made, its odds of rising to the top were 76 percent. 

Patterns of movement
You should be mindful of several dynamics when 
undertaking major strategic moves. First, our 
research shows that really big moves can “cancel 
out” the impact of a poor inheritance. Making  
strong moves with a poor inheritance is about as 
valuable as making poor moves with a strong 
inheritance. And even small improvements in odds 
have a dramatic impact on the expected payoff, 
owing to the extremely steep rise of the power curve. 
For example, the probability-weighted expected 
value of a middle-tier company increasing its odds to 
27 percent from the average of 8 percent is  
$123 million—nearly three times the total average 
economic profit for midtier companies. 

Big moves are also nonlinear, meaning that just 
pulling a lever does not help; you need to pull it hard 
enough to make a difference. For instance, 

productivity improvements that are roughly in line 
with the improvement rates of your industry won’t 
provide an upward boost. Even if you are improving 
on all five measures, what matters is how you  
stack up against your competitors. 

And four of the five big moves are asymmetric. In 
other words, the upside opportunity far outweighs 
the downside risk. While M&A is often touted as  
high risk, for example, in reality programmatic M&A 
not only increases your odds of moving up the  
curve but simultaneously decreases your odds of 
sliding down. Capital expenditures is the one 
exception. By increasing capital expenditures, your 
chances of going up on the power curve increase, 
but so do the chances of dropping. 

In general, making no bold moves is probably the 
most dangerous strategy of all. You not only risk 
stagnation on the power curve but also miss out on 
the additional reward of growth capital, which  
mostly flows to the winners.

Making capital structure 
support strategy

A company’s ratio of debt to equity should support its business strategy, 
not help it pursue tax breaks. Here’s how to get the balance right.

by Marc H. Goedhart, Timothy Koller, and Werner Rehm

increase their returns. Meanwhile, many companies 
are holding substantial amounts of cash and deliber-
ating on what to do with it.

The issue is more nuanced than some pundits sug-
gest. In theory, it may be possible to reduce capital 
structure to a financial calculation to get the most 
tax benefits by favoring debt, for example, or to boost 
earnings per share superficially through share 
buybacks. The result, however, may not be consistent 
with a company’s business strategy, particularly  
if executives add too much debt.2 In the 1990s, for 
example, many telecommunications companies 
financed the acquisition of third-generation (3G) 
licenses entirely with debt, instead of with equity or 
some combination of debt and equity, and they 
found their strategic options constrained when the 
market fell.

Indeed, the potential harm to a company’s operations 
and business strategy from a bad capital structure  
is greater than the potential benefits from tax and 
financial leverage. Instead of relying on capital 
structure to create value on its own, companies 
should try to make it work hand in hand with their 
business strategy, by striking a balance between  
the discipline and tax savings that debt can deliver

CFOs invariably ask themselves two related ques-
tions when managing their balance sheets: should 
they return excess cash to shareholders or invest it 
and should they finance new projects by adding debt 
or drawing on equity? Indeed, achieving the right 
capital structure—the composition of debt and equity 
that a company uses to finance its operations and 
strategic investments—has long vexed aca demics 
and practitioners alike.1 Some focus on the theoretical 
tax benefit of debt, since interest expenses are 
often tax deductible. More recently, executives of 
public companies have wondered if they, like  
some private equity firms, should use debt to 

1   Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, “The cost of capital, corporate finance, and the theory of investment,” American Economic Review, June 

1958, Number 48.

2 There is also some potential for too little debt, though the consequences aren’t as dire.

and the greater flexibility of equity. In the end, most 
industrial companies can create more value by 
making their operations more efficient than they can 
with clever financing.3

Capital structure’s long-term impact
Capital structure affects a company’s overall value 
through its impact on operating cash flows and the 
cost of capital. Since the interest expense on debt is 
tax deductible in most countries, a company can 
reduce its after-tax cost of capital by increasing debt 
relative to equity, thereby directly increasing its 
intrinsic value. While finance textbooks often show 
how the tax benefits of debt have a wide-ranging 
impact on value, they often use too low a discount 
rate for those benefits. In practice, the impact  
is much less significant for large investment-grade 
companies (which have a small relevant range of 
capital structures). Overall, the value of tax benefits  
is quite small over the relevant levels of interest 
coverage. For a typical investment-grade company, 
the change in value over the range of interest 
coverage is less than 5 percent.

The effect of debt on cash flow is less direct but more 
significant. Carrying some debt increases a 
company’s intrinsic value because debt imposes 
discipline; a company must make regular interest  
and principal payments, so it is less likely to pursue 
frivolous investments or acquisitions that don’t  
create value. Having too much debt, however, can 
reduce a company’s intrinsic value by limiting  
its flexibility to make value-creating investments  
of all kinds, including capital expenditures, 
acquisitions, and, just as important, investments in 
intangibles such as business building, R&D, and  
sales and marketing.

Managing capital structure thus becomes a balancing 
act. In our view, the trade-off a company makes 
between financial flexibility and fiscal discipline is the 
most important consideration in determining its 
capital structure and far outweighs any tax benefits, 
which are negligible for most large companies 
unless they have extremely low debt.4

Mature companies with stable and predictable cash 
flows as well as limited investment opportunities 
should include more debt in their capital structure, 
since the discipline that debt often brings out-
weighs the need for flexibility. Companies that face 
high uncertainty because of vigorous growth or  
the cyclical nature of their industries should carry 
less debt, so that they have enough flexibility to  
take advantage of investment opportunities or to 
deal with negative events.

Not that a company’s underlying capital structure 
never creates intrinsic value; sometimes it does. 
When executives have good reason to believe that a 
company’s shares are under- or overvalued, for 
example, they might change the company’s 
underlying capital structure to create value either  
by buying back undervalued shares or by using 
overvalued shares instead of cash to pay for 
acquisitions. Other examples can be found in cyclical 
industries, such as commodity chemicals, where 
investment spending typically follows profits. 
Companies invest in new manufacturing capacity 
when their profits are high and they have cash.5 
Unfortunately, the chemical industry’s historical 
pattern has been that all players invest at the  
same time, which leads to excess capacity when all 
of the plants come on line simultaneously. Over  
the cycle, a company could earn substantially more 
than its competitors if it developed a countercyclical 
strategic capital structure and maintained less  
debt than might otherwise be optimal. During bad 
times, it would then have the ability to make 
investments when its competitors couldn’t.

A practical framework for developing 
capital structure
A company can’t develop its capital structure without 
understanding its future revenues and investment 
requirements. Once those prerequisites are in place, 
it can begin to consider changing its capital 
structure in ways that support the broader strategy. 
A systematic approach can pull together steps  
that many companies already take, along with some 
more novel ones.

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionWhile these tax and signaling effects are 
real, they mainly affect tactical choices 
about how to move toward a defined 
long-term target capital structure, which 
should ultimately support a company’s 
business strategies. 

The case of one global consumer product business  
is illustrative. Growth at this company we’ll call 
Consumerco has been modest. Excluding the effect 
of acquisitions and currency movements, its 
revenues have grown by about 5 percent a year over 
the past five years. Acquisitions added a further  
7 percent annually, and the operating profit margin 
has been stable at around 14 percent. Traditionally, 
Consumerco held little debt: until 2001, its debt  
to enterprise value was less than 10 percent. In 
recent years, however, the company increased its 
debt levels to around 25 percent of its total 
enterprise value in order to pay for acquisitions. 
Once they were complete, management had  
to decide whether to use the company’s cash flows, 
over the next several years, to restore its previous 
low levels of debt or to return cash to its shareholders 
and hold debt stable at the higher level. The 
company’s decision-making process included  
the following steps.

1.  Estimate the financing deficit or surplus. First, 

Consumerco’s executives forecast the financing 
deficit or surplus from its operations and 
strategic investments over the course of the 
industry’s business cycle—in this case,  
three to five years. 

next four years, since no large target companies 
remain in Consumerco’s relevant product 
segments. The company’s cash flow after 
dividends and interest will be positive in 2006 
and then grow steadily until 2008. EBITA 
(earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) 
interest coverage will quickly return to 
historically high levels even exceeding ten  
times interest expenses.

2.  Set a target credit rating. Next, Consumerco set 
a target credit rating and estimated the corre-
sponding capital structure ratios. Consumerco’s 
operating performance is normally stable. 
Executives targeted the high end of a BBB credit 
rating because the company, as an exporter, is 
periodically exposed to significant currency risk 
(otherwise they might have gone further, to a  
low BBB rating). They then translated the target 
credit rating to a target interest coverage ratio 
(EBITA to interest expense) of 4.5. Empirical 
analysis shows that credit ratings can be modeled 
well with three factors: industry, size, and interest 
coverage. By analyzing other large consumer 
product companies, it is possible to estimate the 
likely credit rating at different levels of coverage.

In the base case forecasts, Consumerco’s 
executives projected organic revenue growth of 
5 percent at profit margins of around 14 percent. 
They did not plan for any acquisitions over the 

cycle. Finally, executives set a target debt level of 
€5.7 billion for 2008. For the base case scenario, 
they projected €1.9 billion of EBITA in 2008. The 
target coverage ratio of 4.5 results in a debt  

3.  Develop a target debt level over the business 

Making capital structure support strategy

31

 
level of €8.3 billion. A financing cushion of spare 
debt capacity for contingencies and unforeseen 
events adds €0.5 billion, for a target 2008  
debt level of €7.8 billion. 

Executives then tested this forecast against  
a downside scenario, in which EBITA would 
reach only €1.4 billion in 2008. Following the 
same logic, they arrived at a target debt  
level of €5.7 billion in order to maintain an 
investment-grade rating under the  
downside scenario.

In the example of Consumerco, executives used a 
simple downside scenario relative to the base case 
to adjust for the uncertainty of future cash flows.  
A more sophisticated approach might be useful in 
some industries such as commodities, where future 
cash flows could be modeled using stochastic-
simulation techniques to estimate the probability of 
financial distress at various debt levels.

The final step in this approach is to determine  
how the company should move to the target capital 
structure. This transition involves deciding on the 
appropriate mix of new borrowing, debt repayment, 
dividends, share repurchases, and share issuances 
over the ensuing years.

A company with a surplus of funds, such as 
Consumerco, would return cash to shareholders 
either as dividends or share repurchases. Even  
in the downside scenario, Consumerco will generate 
€1.7 billion of cash above its target EBITA-to-
interest-expense ratio.

For one approach to distributing those funds to 
shareholders, consider the dividend policy of 
Consumerco. Given its modest growth and strong 
cash flow, its dividend payout ratio is currently  
low. The company could easily raise that ratio to  
45 percent of earnings, from 30 percent. Increasing 
the regular dividend sends the stock market a  
strong signal that Consumerco thinks it can pay the 
higher dividend comfortably. The remaining  
€1.3 billion would then typically be returned to share-
holders through share repurchases over the next 
several years. Because of liquidity issues in the stock 
market, Consumerco might be able to repurchase 
only about one billion shares, but it could consider 
issuing a one-time dividend for the remainder.

The signaling effect6 is probably the most important 
consideration in deciding between dividends and 
share repurchases. Companies should also consider 
differences in the taxation of dividends and share 
buybacks, as well as the fact that shareholders have 
the option of not participating in a repurchase, since 
the cash they receive must be reinvested.

While these tax and signaling effects are real, they 
mainly affect tactical choices about how to move 
toward a defined long-term target capital structure, 
which should ultimately support a company’s 
business strategies by balancing the flexibility of 
lower debt with the discipline (and tax savings)  
of higher debt.

doesn’t need the cash to cover future commitments, such as interest payments and capital expenditures.

How executives can help 
sustain value creation for 
the long term

Joint research from FCLTGlobal and McKinsey highlights the behaviors 
that can help corporate leaders and board directors sidestep pressures 
and stay focused on the long term.

of employees, customers, and other stakeholders.2 
But a survey of approximately 500 global executives 
conducted by FCLTGlobal and McKinsey shows that 
many continue to feel pressure from shareholders 
and directors to meet near-term earnings targets at 
the expense of long-term strategies.3

In one data point, respondents said they believed 
their companies would cut long-term growth 
investments by 17 percent, on average, when faced 
with a 15 percent decrease in revenue—even though 
the survey specified that the dip resulted from 
external factors (such as currency fluctuations), would 
not imperil the company’s existence, and would not 
persist. Other survey responses were similarly 
short-term oriented—and not just because of the 
COVID-19 pandemic or other economic shocks.4

We wanted to understand better what differentiates 
long-term-oriented companies from others. How 
have they sidestepped the pressures? We reviewed 
and synthesized our own research and that of

Ample evidence shows that when executives 
consistently make decisions and investments with 
long-term objectives in mind, their companies 
generate more shareholder value, create more jobs, 
and contribute more to economic growth than do 
peer companies that focus on the short term.1 Data 
also show that companies can achieve better long-
term performance when they address the interests

rather than just short-term performance: 

 — Invest sufficient capital and talent in large, risky 

initiatives to achieve a winning position.

 — Construct a portfolio of strategic initiatives that 
deliver returns exceeding the cost of capital.

 — Dynamically allocate capital and talent (through 
divestitures, if need be) to the businesses and 
initiatives that create the most value.

 — Generate value not only for shareholders  

but also for employees, customers, and  
other stakeholders.

 — Resist the temptation to take actions that boost 

short-term profits.

Global executives who choose to take these actions 
can, apart from gaining clear performance 
advantages for their organizations, resolve much of 
the perceived conflict between stakeholders’ 
interests and shareholders’ interests. In fact, the 
two sets of interests largely converge in the  
long run. Companies create long-term value for 
investors only when they satisfy customers, engage 
and motivate employees, and maintain good 
relations with communities and regulators across 
extended time horizons.

Invest sufficient capital and talent  
in large initiatives 
Instead of playing to win, many established 
businesses play to avoid losing and, as a result, 
struggle to stay in front of competitors. Long- 
term-oriented companies identify strategic moves 

that will keep them ahead in the long run. They  
also commit ample resources to strategic initiatives, 
such as product innovation, marketing, sales,  
and talent development. Amazon and Microsoft are 
two such companies. During the past 15 years,  
both have invested large sums in their cloud-
computing businesses. In 2020, those businesses 
generated revenues of around $45 billion and  
$59 billion, respectively—far more than competitors 
that put less money and talent into their cloud-
computing plays.5

Sustained investments in strategic priorities matter 
for long-term performance because they lead to 
higher rates of revenue growth, and revenue growth 
is an important driver of long-term TSR. Our 
research shows that companies in the top third of 
their industries in revenue growth generated TSR 
that exceeded those of their bottom-third peers by 
six to eight percentage points per year. Those 
trends held over a ten-year period—the additional 
gains of top-third companies yielded shareholder 
returns that were 80 to 110 percent greater than 
those of the bottom-third companies. 

Of course, revenue growth alone won’t deliver 
shareholder value over the long term. It’s just as 
critical to deliver strong ROIC.

Construct a portfolio of  
initiatives whose returns exceed  
the cost of capital 
According to a fundamental principle of corporate 
finance, companies create long-term shareholder 
value only when their ROIC exceeds their cost of 
capital. That seems obvious, yet large numbers of 
companies around the world still misplace their 
focus.6 They should consider reviewing the empirical 
evidence—among companies with similar growth 
rates, for instance, those with higher ROIC achieve 
higher valuation multiples and produce greater 
shareholder returns over the long term, according  
to McKinsey research.7

34

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionThe objective for long-term-oriented companies, 
therefore, should be to find the combinations of 
growth and ROIC that work for them, given the 
conditions in their industries and the opportunities 
they face. Consider how two US companies, retail 
giant Costco and spirits and winemaker Brown-
Forman, created substantial long-term value in 
different ways. From 1996 to 2017, Costco’s after-
tax operating profits grew by 11 percent per year, 
whereas Brown-Forman’s grew by 7 percent per 
year.8 Yet the two companies generated identical 
share holder returns of 15 percent a year. Brown-
Forman matched Costco on that count because its 
ROIC of 29 percent exceeded Costco’s 13 percent.

Not every investment a company makes has to earn 
more than its cost of capital. Large companies can 
simultaneously make multiple bets—and not just on 
those initiatives with the highest chances of 
succeeding. They may make some risky bets with 
the potential to yield high rewards. If an entire 
portfolio of strategic initiatives earns more than its 
aggregate cost of capital, the company can expect 
to create value over the long term.

Dynamically reallocate capital and 
talent to high-value initiatives 
Managing for the long term requires executives to 
monitor their companies’ standing in the market and 
to enter or exit businesses as the competitive 
landscape shifts—even if it involves shrinking a 
company. They must also be willing to move  
talent and other resources to the highest-value 
initiatives and to do so frequently. 

Consider the situation at Walmart. Leaders at the 
company chose to commit to a major omnichannel 
initiative, even as they anticipated that some 
investors would object to the short-term financial hit 
from the move despite its potential long-term 
benefits. Since 2014, the company has invested more 
than $5 billion per year in its e-commerce and 
omnichannel capabilities. It dynamically reallocated 
capital to match its new approach to serving 
customers by increasing funding for supply-chain 
improvements, store transformations, and  
digital initiatives. It also made strategic acquisitions, 
including Jet.com in the United States and  
a controlling stake in India’s e-commerce giant 

If an entire portfolio of strategic 
initiatives earns more than its aggregate 
cost of capital, the company can expect 
to create value over the long term.

Walmart adapts to changes in customer needs and 
the competitive landscape. 

Those who worry that investors will frown on 
acquisitions and divestitures should take heart: the 
research shows that the stock market consistently 
reacts positively to both sales and spin-offs. 

McKinsey research shows that companies that 
rapidly reallocated resources and talent were  
2.2 times more likely to outperform their competitors 
on TSR than were those that reallocated resources 
and talent at a slower clip.9 It also reveals that taking 
swift action in anticipation of long-term trends is 
better than waiting too long: 43 percent of respon-
dents in a survey on divestitures said they parted 
with assets too late or didn’t divest them when they 
should have.10 Among the reasons they cited  
for delay were “waiting for business performance  
to improve” and “difficulty of replacing lost  
earnings” (exhibit).

Generate value for all stakeholders 
Long-term-oriented companies focus on improving 
outcomes for all their stakeholders, not just those 
who own shares in the business. They typically rely 
on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
initiatives to address the needs of a range of stake-
holders. In doing so, the research shows, they  
stand to improve revenue growth, reduce costs, 
optimize investment decisions, improve  
employee productivity, and reduce regulatory  
and legal interventions.

 10  Results are from a June 2020 survey of 128 executives, board members, and corporate-development leaders at companies with revenues of 

more than $1 billion.

36

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionIn a 2019 McKinsey survey, 57 percent of respondents 
said they believed ESG programs create long-term 
value, and 83 percent said they expected ESG 
programs to contribute more share holder value in the 
long term than they did at that time.11 Respondents 
also said they would be willing to pay a 10 percent 
median premium for a company with a positive ESG 
record compared with a company with a negative 
ESG record.

The second is to cut costs to an extent that could 
weaken the company’s competitive positions. For 
example, to achieve ambitious earnings targets,  
a new leader at a retail company cut spending on the 
frontline sales force by reducing the number of 
in-store workers and curtailing training programs for 
those who remained. Over time, customers took 
notice—and took their business elsewhere. The 
company’s stock price soon plummeted. 

Such responses don’t mean that a company should 
act on every ESG idea that comes along. Rather, 
executives should actively search for and invest in 
initiatives that benefit both stakeholders and 
shareholders. The executive team at Walmart, for 
instance, will undertake environmental projects  
with negligible financial returns if managers agree, 
after debate, that those projects will yield  
other significant benefits to stakeholders. Many of 
Walmart’s other environmental initiatives offer 
positive net present value, and so, using a portfolio-
level approach to managing risks and returns, the 
company can cover the costs of those that don’t. 

Resist temptation 
When temporary changes in fortune—dips in 
revenue, for example—occur, moves to boost short-
term results can seem very appealing to pressured 
executives. Such moves seldom turn out well, 
however. In our survey, respondents who said execu-
tives at their companies tried to meet short-term 
financial targets by taking actions that created no 
long-term value also said their companies had 
worse financial outcomes than others did. Respon-
dents said those companies were half as likely  
as their peers were to realize more organic revenue 
growth and 27 percent less likely to generate  
higher levels of ROIC.

In our experience, long-term-oriented companies 
actively seek to resist three common temptations. 
The first is to starve long-term growth investments  
to make up for short-term challenges, such as 
earnings deviations. 

In both cases of temptation, executives would do well 
to lay out their strategic plans. They can explain to 
key stakeholders that they aren’t choosing to depart 
from those plans just to hit short-term targets. 

The final temptation is to reduce the natural volatility 
in revenue and earnings artificially. Many executives 
believe that “smooth” earnings growth somehow 
contributes to value creation. But according to our 
research, plenty of companies with more volatile 
earnings growth in the short term generate high TSR 
in the long term, and plenty of low-volatility 
companies generate low shareholder returns.12 
Indeed, when institutional investors were asked to 
rate the impor tance of various factors in their 
investment decisions, very few prioritized companies’ 
ability to maintain low earnings volatility. More 
important to them were management teams’ 
credibility and willingness to take risks with the  
long term in mind.

Changing mindsets and behaviors
Getting a company to manage for long-term perfor-
mance requires considerable effort. CEOs and 
directors must take up new behaviors, abandon old 
ones, and empower managers to make decisions 
with long-term outcomes in mind. 

Board behaviors 
A board of directors ordinarily has a well-established 
role: thinking about the future of a company, 
approving its strategy, reviewing its performance, 
and evaluating management. Few boards spend

of the businesses they direct, yet they

the long term.

enough time assessing the strategies and investment 
plans of the businesses they direct. Yet they can 
help orient management toward the long term in 
three ways:

 — Ensure that strategic investments are fully 

funded each year and have the appropriate talent 
assigned to them. To formalize the practice, 
boards can ask management teams to report  
on the funding and progress of strategic 
initiatives and review that report for signs of 
effective strategic implementation.

 — Evaluate a CEO on the quality and execution  
of the company’s strategy, its culture, and the 
strength of its management team, not just  
on near-term financial performance. Responses  
to the survey by FCLTGlobal and McKinsey  
indi cated that companies that evaluated 
executives’ performance primarily based on 
financial results—rather than on how they 
achieved those results—were 13 percent less 
likely to have revenue growth above peers.

CEO behaviors
CEOs, supported by their top teams, are ultimately 
responsible for creating a focus on the long term  
in their companies. They must serve as role models 
for the rest of their management teams when 
making big decisions. They can also apply their 
influence and authority in four ways:

 — Ensure that strategic initiatives are funded and 
staffed properly and protected from short-term-
earnings pressure. Our survey found that 
companies whose CEOs allocated resources  
to critical growth areas were more likely  
than their peers to exhibit greater organic 
revenue growth.

 — Adapt management systems to encourage bold 
risk taking and to counter biased decision 
making. For example, implementing a company-
wide rather than a business-unit-level approach 
to resource allocation can help managers see 
that their portfolios can accommodate bets on 
relatively risky endeavors. 

 — Structure executive compensation over longer 

time horizons, including the time after executives 
leave their companies. Adjusting some elements 
of executive-pay structures, such as the time 
hori zon over which CEOs are compensated, 
appears to encourage long-term behaviors on 
the part of CEOs.

 — Actively identify and engage long-term-oriented 
investors—and have the courage to ignore short-
term-focused shareholders and other similarly 
minded members of the investment community. 
CEOs should spend more time talking with  
long-term investors. Such conversations  
can help reassure executives that a long-term 

38

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionoutlook best serves their company and  
its shareholders.

 — Demonstrate the link between financial and 
nontraditional metrics to prevent short-term 
trade-offs. To enrich the dialogue with long-
term shareholders and other stakeholders, 
executives can select, track, and report on the 
non traditional indicators, such as employee 
satisfaction, that are most material to their 
companies’ long-term performance.

Executives undeniably face real pressure to focus 
on and deliver satisfactory short-term results. 
However, they must weigh short-term demands 
against the flood of empirical evidence showing that 
companies that seek strong long-term results 
outperform companies that optimize short-term 
gains. By understanding which management 
behaviors distinguish successful long-term compa-
nies and expressly fostering those behaviors,  
CEOs and boards can help their companies produce 
value for stakeholders over the long run.

Why ‘digital’ is no 
different when it comes 
to valuation

Whether tech enabled or old school, proposed projects and initiatives 
need to be assessed according to the cash flows they generate. The trick 
is getting the base case right.

by Liz Ericson and Tim Koller

Our colleagues examined how a typical consumer-
packaged-goods company defined the term  
and identified at least 33 types of digital initiatives—
including digital marketing, optimization of  
sales-force coverage, predictive maintenance, 
supply-chain planning, and robotic process 
automation in the back office.

Given the prevailing fuzzy definition of digital,  
it isn’t surprising that business leaders are often 
unsure how to evaluate the myriad technology-
enabled initiatives being proposed to them and how 
much value those initiatives may create. In a 2018 
survey of 1,733 managers, about eight in ten said 
their organi zations were pursuing digital initiatives. 
But only 14 percent of the managers said they had 
realized significant performance improvements 
from these efforts, and only 3 percent said they had 
successfully sustained any changes.1

A suggestion for these business leaders: don’t get 
tripped up by digital labels; follow the same 
principles that apply to all investment decisions. That 
is, evaluate digital projects and strategies based on

Ask any dozen business leaders how they  
define “digital,” and you will probably get just as 
many different answers. For some, digital is  
just an upgraded term for what their IT functions do. 
For others, it refers to the use of online tools and 
technologies to make process changes, to enable 
performance improvements, or to pursue 
organizational transformation. For still others, it’s  
an excuse to question the hows and the whys  
in their core businesses.

the cash flows they are expected to gen erate, 
making sure to factor in “do nothing” scenarios (or 
base cases) and the overarching objectives of the 
digital project or strategy being proposed. 

While that approach sounds simple, getting it right 
requires some thoughtful strategic analysis. 

Don’t skip the base case
Which of the following (if either) would be more 
valuable to the organization: investing in a new 
e-commerce site or investing in some automation 
software that could improve the company’s 
procurement processes? Executives often argue 
that such digital-investment decisions can be 
difficult to make for a range of reasons, including 
the following:

 — The benefits from digital initiatives often don’t 
materialize right away, and the projects can 
have front-loaded or “shadow” costs—as a result 
of, say, building a new digital business while 
maintaining the core business. 

 — Proposed digital initiatives can’t be meaning fully 

compared against traditional ones.

 — The value of a specific feature (interest-free 

credit, for example) can be difficult to 
disentangle from its context. 

 — The link back to the core business decision 

underpinning the digital strategy or initiative  
can be obfuscated. 

 — Executives are wary of experiencing “death by 

1,000 pilots that don’t scale.”

The decision-making default, then, has been to lean 
in on digital opportunities not because they are  
the best options but for other reasons—for instance, 
the potential improvements seem to be the most 
visible or the project owners are shouting the 
loudest. As the impact metrics shared previously 
reveal, this approach creates uneven results. 

Ideally, all investment decisions should be analyzed 
against an alternative course of action. For digital 
projects, the alternative may be to do nothing. But 
especially in the case of digital projects, the 
do-nothing case may not mean net-zero change; it 
may actually mean a steady (or accelerating)  
erosion of value. Consider the decision that many 
banks have faced over the years about whether  
to invest in mobile-banking apps: if all of a bank’s 
competitors have mobile apps and the bank  
doesn’t invest in one, its market share will likely  
fall over time as it loses customers or fails to  
attract new ones. Therefore, the base case isn’t 
stable profits and cash flows; instead, it’s a  
decline in profits and cash flows—along with  
a reputation for being a stale brand. 

For reasons of comfort and even self-preservation, 
business leaders are often reluctant to build and 
share business-as-usual projections that show 
declines in profits and cash flows. Yet such declines 
are what most often happen when companies  
avoid change. Companies must be realistic about 
the potential for declining base cases. By 
developing an honest base case and a full range  
of cash-flow scenarios, business leaders can  
more meaningfully compare digital initiatives and 
strategies against other investments that may  
be competing for scarce resources. This approach 
may also prompt companies to think more 
strategically about how, when, and how much to 
invest in digital projects, given how quickly 
customers’ expectations are changing.

Examine potential impact from digital 
Building a realistic base case can provide the data 
needed to vet the potential impact of a digital 
strategy or initiative. It’s also important, however, to 
identify the type of impact that digital strategies  
and initiatives may have and frame investment 
discussions accordingly. There can be some overlap, 
but companies’ digital initiatives typically fall into 
one of two categories. 

Why ‘digital’ is no different when it comes to valuation

41

By developing an honest base case and  
a full range of cash-flow scenarios, 
business leaders can more meaningfully 
compare digital initiatives and strategies 
against other investments.

The first category is the application of digital tools 
and technologies to disrupt an industry funda-
mentally, requiring a major revamp of a company’s 
business model or a spooling up of new businesses, 
some of which may even cannibalize the company’s 
core strengths. The second (less dramatic but  
still critical) category is when companies use digital 
simply to do the things they already do, only  
better—in service to, for instance, cost reduction, 
improved customer experience, new sources of 
revenue, and better decision making. 

New business models
In some cases, the use of digital tools and technol-
ogies can upend entire business models or  
create entirely new businesses. Look no further than 
the way the internet has changed the ways that 
consumers research and purchase airline tickets and 
hotel rooms, disintermediating many traditional 
travel agents—one of the original cases of industry 
reinvention. The introduction of video-streaming 
services has disrupted the economics of traditional 
broadcast and cable TV channels. And the rise of 
cloud computing not only has reshaped how 
companies are transforming themselves but also 
has entirely disrupted two other industries: 
manufac turers of mainframe and server computers  
and businesses that run companies’ data centers. 
Cloud computing itself has become an enormous 
business: $150 billion was spent on cloud services 
and infrastructure over the first half of 2019.

To value these new opportunities, business leaders 
should use the standard discounted-cash-flow 
approach. The fact that these businesses often 
grow fast and don’t earn profits early on shouldn’t 
affect the valuation approach. Investors can 
certainly be patient at times, as Amazon saw for 
decades with its retail business, but digital  
initiatives will eventually need to generate profits 
and cash flow and earn an attractive ROIC. 

With high-growth companies, business leaders 
must start from the future rather than the present—
markets may not exist yet, so scenario planning  
is critical.2 A look at the fundamental economics of 
the business can help managers build a realistic 
estimate of returns, but another important consider-
ation is whether the new digital business will 
engender network effects. That is, as companies 
grow, they can earn higher margins and ROIC 
because their products become more valu able with 
each new customer. In most industries, competition 
forces returns back to reasonable levels. But in 
industries with network effects, competition is kept 
at bay by the low and decreasing unit costs of the 
market leader (hence the industry tag “winner takes 
all”) and the inconvenience to customers of 
switching to new suppliers (the “lock-in effect”).

Companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google have 
leveraged their payment, single-sign-on, and 
connectivity products to create incremental value 

2  “High-growth companies,” in Marc Goedhart, Tim Koller, and David Wessels, Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies, 

seventh edition, Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, June 2020, pp. 709–24.

42

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionfrom each new user. Microsoft’s Office software 
provides another good, if tried-and-true, example of 
network effects. It has long been the workplace 
standard for word processing, creating spreadsheets, 
and generating graphics. As the installed base of 
Office users expanded, it became ever-more 
attractive for new customers to use Office for these  
tasks because they could share documents, 
calculations, and images with so many others. As 
the customer base grew, margins were very high 
because the incremental cost of providing software 
through DVDs or downloads was so low. 

Cost reduction
Many digital initiatives help companies reduce 
operating costs. One mining company saved more 
than $360 million per year from process-
automation software that gave managers more 
insight into what exactly was happening in  
the field, enabling managers to make adjustments 
on the fly. Meanwhile, several fossil-fuel-based 
power generators learned that they could improve 
their plants’ heat rates (how efficiently the plants  
use fuel) by up to 3 percent by using sensors and 
actuators for remote monitoring and automated 
operations and by employing smart valves that self-
report and repair leakages.3

Understanding the economics of cost reduction  
isn’t as straightforward as it may seem. Business 
leaders might be tempted to estimate present  
value by simply discounting the expected savings 
and subtracting the investments required. But 
business leaders must also examine the second-
order effects. 

In a competitive industry—chemicals, for instance—
cost reductions might simply be passed through  
to customers as price reductions. The present value 
of such a chemical company’s cost-reduction efforts 
would seem to be zero. But a look at the alter native 
case reveals something different: if competitors are 
pursuing digital initiatives to reduce costs and  
your company isn’t, you will still have to reduce your 
prices in line with those of your compet i tors. The 
alternative to the digital initiative would be a decline 

in cash flows because of lower prices without 
reduced costs. The present value of the initiative may 
turn positive again once the business leader 
compares the initiative with the right base case. 

Improved customer experience
Consumers have benefited tremendously from 
companies’ digital innovations, particularly 
regarding the purchasing experience. A customer 
can buy an item of clothing in a physical store  
or online and have it shipped to the buyer’s home, to 
a local store, or to any one of thousands of pickup 
points. If a local store doesn’t have the right size for 
an in-store shopper, the customer can order it  
on the spot and have it delivered to their home. A 
cus tomer who decides to return an item can  
return it to any of the company’s physical stores or 
mail it back, regardless of how it was purchased. 
Consumers can also track in real time the progress 
of the shipments heading their way.

Using digitization to improve the customer experi-
ence can add value to the business in a variety  
of ways. In some cases, it can lead to reduced costs. 
An electricity-distribution company fully redesigned 
its customer interfaces in a “digital first” way that 
made a priority of customers’ online interactions. As 
a result, its customer satisfaction rose 25 percentage 
points, employee satisfaction increased by ten 
percentage points, and customer-service costs fell 
40 percent.

As is the case with applying digital solutions to 
reduce costs, it’s critical to think through the 
compet itive effects of investing in digital to gain a 
superior customer experience. In many situations, 
customers have come to expect an improved 
experience and are unwilling to pay extra for it. 
Meanwhile, providing omnichannel services can be 
expensive for retailers; the cost to ship online orders 
often makes these sales unprofitable, especially  
as shipping is expected to be free and fast (same day, 
in some cases). Meanwhile, in-store sales may  
be declining as a result of the omnichannel services, 
leading to lower margins, as some costs are fixed.

Why ‘digital’ is no different when it comes to valuation

43

Even so, retailers have little choice but to provide 
omnichannel services despite lower profitability. If 
they don’t, they stand to lose even more revenues 
and profits. When vetting digital initiatives in this 
category, business leaders should ask themselves 
some questions. Does the improved customer 
service lead to higher market share because the 
company’s cus tomer service is better than that  
of competitors? Or does it maintain the company’s 
market share or avoid losing market share because 
competitors are doing the same thing?

New sources of revenue
Some companies have been able to create new 
revenue sources through digital initiatives. In these 
cases, the economic analysis versus the base  
case is more straightforward because, at least for a 
while, the company (and maybe its competitors) are 
making the pie bigger for the whole industry. 

For instance, an ice-cream manufacturer set up 
centralized freezers in the United Kingdom.  
A delivery company picks up the ice cream and 
delivers it to customers within a short time period. 
This service has generated more than ten times  
the volume of convenience-store freezers—and 
mostly in additional sales because without the 
convenient delivery, customers might simply skip 
the ice cream. In another case, an industrial-
equipment manufacturer created a data-driven 

service business that collects soil samples and 
analyzes weather patterns to help farmers optimize 
crop yields. Sensors in tractors and other machin ery 
provide data for predictive maintenance, automated 
sprinkler systems synchronize with weather data, 
and an open-software platform lets third parties 
build new service apps.4

Such new sources of revenue can create value 
because they don’t involve just keeping up with the 
competition. In both examples, digital innovations 
created an overall increase in the revenue pool for 
the industry—even for the same old product—
whether in overall consumption of ice cream or 
overall demand for precision-farming services.

Better decision making
Some executives are using advanced analytics to 
make better decisions about a broad range of 
business activities. Doing so can generate additional 
revenues, reduce costs, or both. For instance, a 
consumer-products company used advanced 
analytics to improve the design of its planograms 
(models of how it will allocate its limited space on 
retail shelves, describing which products to include 
and how to display them). The analytics program 
revealed to the company’s decision makers that they 
could dramatically improve the effectiveness of  
their product placements. They were able to gain 
these insights by continually comparing and 

In many situations, customers have 
come to expect an improved experience 
and are unwilling to pay extra for it.

waiting for weeks of physical-store receipts  
to hint at performance. 

At the same time, the company was able to reduce 
the number of people required to design the 
planograms from ten to just two, driving down costs.

In this case, the investment in advanced analytics 
helped the company increase total customer 
spending by getting customers to upgrade to more 
profitable products. And because the change 
involved only choices within the company’s product 
mix, the improvement created value without 
necessarily inviting a competitive response. In other 
cases, the benefits may be diluted because 
competitors take similar actions, but the investment 
in analytics still may create value by maintaining 
competitive parity.

In our experience, it’s easy for executives to get 
caught up in discussions about how technologies 
work and then try become fluent in them—for 

instance, by asking what knowledge graphs are, 
how exactly machines learn, and so on. More 
important, though, is to focus on identifying which 
decisions create (or destroy) the most value in  
their organizations and then consider the application 
of advanced analytics toward those discussions. 
The ultimate goal is to gain better insights and even 
prescriptive answers on how to operate.

As executives and investors seek to understand  
the competitive implications of digital technologies, 
it bears remembering that these topics and the 
management responses to them will likely be fluid 
for some time to come. It’s also worth remem bering 
that even when definitions seem fuzzy, the 
principles of valuation are not. They are steadfast 
and reliable, and they can help business leaders 
drown out the noise and distinguish value-creating 
opportunities from value-destroying ones.

Do fundamentals—or 
emotions—drive the 
stock market?

Emotions can drive market behavior in a few short-lived situations.  
But fundamentals still rule.

in immediately distilling new information and  
that investors, driven by emotion, can indeed lead 
markets awry. Some behaviorists would even  
assert that stock markets lead lives of their own, 
detached from economic growth and business 
profitability. A number of finance scholars and 
practitioners have argued that stock markets are 
not efficient—that is, that they don’t necessarily 
reflect economic fundamentals.1 According to this 
point of view, significant and lasting deviations  
from the intrinsic value of a company’s share price 
occur in market valuations.

There’s never been a better time to be a behaviorist. 
During four decades, the academic theory that 
financial markets accurately reflect a stock’s 
underlying value was all but unassailable. But lately,  
the view that investors can fundamentally change  
a market’s course through irrational decisions has 
been moving into the mainstream.

With the exuberance of the high-tech stock bubble 
and the crash of the late 1990s still fresh in investors’ 
memories, adherents of the behaviorist school  
are finding it easier than ever to spread the belief 
that markets can be something less than efficient  

The argument is more than academic. In the 1980s 
the rise of stock market index funds, which now  
hold some $1 trillion in assets, was caused in large 
part by the conviction among investors that 
efficient-market theories were valuable. And  
current debates in the United States and elsewhere 
about privatizing Social Security and other 
retirement systems may hinge on assumptions 
about how investors are likely to handle their 
retirement options.

We agree that behavioral finance offers some 
valuable insights—chief among them the idea that 
markets are not always right, since rational investors

can’t always correct for mispricing by irrational  
ones. But for managers, the critical question is how 
often these deviations arise and whether they are  
so frequent and significant that they should affect 
the process of financial decision making. In fact, 
significant deviations from intrinsic value are rare, 
and markets usually revert rapidly to share prices 
commensurate with economic fundamentals. 
Therefore, managers should continue to use the 
tried-and-true analysis of a company’s discounted 
cash flow to make their valuation decisions.

When markets deviate
Behavioral-finance theory holds that markets might 
fail to reflect economic fundamentals under three 
conditions. When all three apply, the theory predicts 
that pricing biases in financial markets can be both 
significant and persistent.

Irrational behavior. Investors behave irrationally 
when they don’t correctly process all the available 
information while forming their expectations of  
a company’s future performance. Some investors, 
for example, attach too much importance to  
recent events and results, an error that leads them 
to overprice companies with strong recent 
performance. Others are excessively conservative 
and underprice stocks of companies that have 
released positive news.

Systematic patterns of behavior. Even if individual 
investors decided to buy or sell without consulting 
economic fundamentals, the impact on share prices 
would still be limited. Only when their irrational 
behavior is also systematic (that is, when large groups 
of investors share particular patterns of behavior) 
should persistent price deviations occur. Hence 
behavioral-finance theory argues that patterns of 
overconfidence, overreaction, and overrepresen-
tation are common to many investors and that such 
groups can be large enough to prevent a company’s 
share price from reflecting underlying economic 
fundamentals—at least for some stocks, some of 
the time.

Limits to arbitrage in financial markets. When 
investors assume that a company’s recent strong 
performance alone is an indication of future perfor-
mance, they may start bidding for shares and  

drive up the price. Some investors might expect a 
company that surprises the market in one quarter to 
go on exceeding expectations. As long as enough 
other investors notice this myopic overpricing and 
respond by taking short positions, the share price 
will fall in line with its underlying indicators.

This sort of arbitrage doesn’t always occur, however. 
In practice, the costs, complexity, and risks involved 
in setting up a short position can be too high for 
individual investors. If, for example, the share price 
doesn’t return to its fundamental value while  
they can still hold on to a short position—the 
so-called noise-trader risk—they may have to sell 
their holdings at a loss.

Momentum and other matters
Two well-known patterns of stock market deviations 
have received considerable attention in academic 
studies during the past decade: long-term reversals 
in share prices and short-term momentum.

First, consider the phenomenon of reversal—high-
performing stocks of the past few years typically 
become low-performing stocks of the next few. 
Behavioral finance argues that this effect is caused 
by an overreaction on the part of investors: when 
they put too much weight on a company’s recent 
performance, the share price becomes inflated. As 
additional information becomes available, investors 
adjust their expectations and a reversal occurs.  
The same behavior could explain low returns after an 
initial public offering (IPO), seasoned offerings, a 
new listing, and so on. Presumably, such companies 
had a history of strong performance, which was  
why they went public in the first place.

Momentum, on the other hand, occurs when positive 
returns for stocks over the past few months are 
followed by several more months of positive  
returns. Behavioral-finance theory suggests that 
this trend results from systematic underreaction: 
overconservative investors underestimate the true 
impact of earnings, divestitures, and share 
repurchases, for example, so stock prices don’t 
instantaneously react to good or bad news.

But academics are still debating whether irrational 
investors alone can be blamed for the long-term-

Do fundamentals—or emotions—drive the stock market?

47

reversal and short-term-momentum patterns  
in returns. Some believe that long-term reversals 
result merely from incorrect measurements of  
a stock’s risk premium, because investors ignore  
the risks associated with a company’s size and 
market-to-capital ratio.2 These statistics could be  
a proxy for liquidity and distress risk.

Similarly, irrational investors don’t necessarily drive 
short-term momentum in share price returns.  
Profits from these patterns are relatively limited 
after transaction costs have been deducted.  
Thus, small momentum biases could exist even if all 
investors were rational.

Furthermore, behavioral finance still cannot explain 
why investors overreact under some conditions 
(such as IPOs) and underreact in others (such as 
earnings announcements). Since there is no 
systematic way to predict how markets will respond, 
some have concluded that this is a further indication 
of their accuracy.3

Persistent mispricing in carve-outs and 
dual-listed companies
Two well-documented types of market deviation—
the mispricing of carve-outs and of dual-listed 
companies—are used to support behavioral- 

finance theory. The classic example is the pricing  
of 3Com and Palm after the latter’s carve-out  
in March 2000.

In anticipation of a full spin-off within nine months, 
3Com floated 5 percent of its Palm subsidiary. 
Almost immediately, Palm’s market capitalization 
was higher than the entire market value of 3Com, 
implying that 3Com’s other businesses had a 
negative value. Given the size and profitability of the 
rest of 3Com’s businesses, this result would clearly 
indicate mispricing. Why did rational investors  
fail to exploit the anomaly by going short on Palm’s 
shares and long on 3Com’s? The reason was that 
the number of available Palm shares was extremely 
small after the carve-out: 3Com still held 95 percent 
of them. As a result, it was extremely difficult to 
establish a short position, which would have required 
borrowing shares from a Palm shareholder.

During the months following the carve-out,  
the mispricing gradually became less pronounced 
as the supply of shares through short sales 
increased steadily. Yet while many investors and 
analysts knew about the price difference, it 
persisted for two months—until the Internal 
Revenue Service formally approved the carve-out’s 
tax-free status in early May 2002. At that point,  
a significant part of the uncertainty around the spin-

Two types of market deviation—the 
mispricing of carve-outs and of dual-
listed companies—are used to support 
behavioral-finance theory.

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionoff was removed and the price discrepancy 
disappeared. This correction suggests that at least 
part of the mispricing was caused by the risk that 
the spin-off wouldn’t occur.

Additional cases of mispricing between parent 
companies and their carved-out subsidiaries are 
well documented.4 In general, these cases  
involve difficulties setting up short positions to 
exploit the price differences, which persist  
until the spin-off takes place or is abandoned.  
In all cases, the mispricing was corrected within 
several months.

Does this indict the market for mispricing? We don’t 
think so. In recent years, the price differences for 
Royal Dutch/Shell and other twin-share stocks have 
all become smaller. Furthermore, some of these 
share structures (and price differences) disappeared 
because the corporations formally merged, a 
development that underlines the significance of 
noise-trader risk: as soon as a formal date was  
set for definitive price convergence, arbitrageurs 
stepped in to correct any discrepancy. This pattern 
provides additional evidence that mispricing  
occurs only under special circumstances—and is by 
no means a common or long-lasting phenomenon.

A second classic example of investors deviating 
from fundamentals is the price disparity between 
the shares of the same company traded on two 
different exchanges. Consider the case of Royal 
Dutch Petroleum and “Shell” Transport and Trading, 
which are traded on the Amsterdam and London 
stock markets, respectively. Since these twin shares 
are entitled to a fixed 60-40 portion of the dividends 
of Royal Dutch/Shell, you would expect their  
share prices to remain in this fixed ratio.

Over long periods, however, they have not. In fact, 
prolonged periods of mispricing can be found  
for several similar twin-share structures, such as 
Unilever. This phenomenon occurs because large 
groups of investors prefer (and are prepared to pay a 
premium for) one of the twin shares. Rational 
investors typically do not take positions to exploit 
the opportunity for arbitrage.

Thus in the case of Royal Dutch/Shell, a price 
differential of as much as 30 percent has persisted 
at times. Why? The opportunity to arbitrage dual-
listed stocks is actually quite unpredictable and 
potentially costly. Because of noise-trader risk, even 
a large gap between share prices is no guarantee 
that those prices will converge in the near term.

Markets and fundamentals:  
The bubble of the 1990s
Do markets reflect economic fundamentals? We 
believe so. Long-term returns on capital and growth 
have been remarkably consistent for the past  
35 years, in spite of some deep recessions and 
periods of very strong economic growth. The 
median return on equity for all US companies has 
been a very stable 12 to 15 percent, and long-term 
GDP growth for the US economy in real terms  
has been about 3 percent a year since 1945.5 We 
also estimate that the inflation-adjusted cost  
of equity since 1965 has been fairly stable, at  
about 7 percent.6

We used this information to estimate the intrinsic 
P/E ratios for the US and UK stock markets and 
then compared them with the actual values.7 This 
analysis has led us to three important conclusions. 
The first is that US and UK stock markets, by and 
large, have been fairly priced, hovering near their 
intrinsic P/E ratios. This figure was typically  
around 15, with the exception of the high-inflation 
years of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when  
it was closer to 10 (exhibit).

Second, the late 1970s and late 1990s produced 
significant deviations from intrinsic valuations.  
In the late 1970s, when investors were obsessed 
with high short-term inflation rates, the market  
was probably undervalued; long-term real GDP 
growth and returns on equity indicate that it 
shouldn’t have bottomed out at P/E levels of around 
7. The other well-known deviation occurred in  
the late 1990s, when the market reached a P/E ratio 
of around 30—a level that couldn’t be justified  
by 3 percent long-term real GDP growth or by  
13 percent returns on book equity.

Third, when such deviations occurred, the stock 
market returned to its intrinsic-valuation level within 
about three years. Thus, although valuations have 
been wrong from time to time—even for the stock 
market as a whole—eventually they have fallen back 
in line with economic fundamentals.

Focus on intrinsic value
What are the implications for corporate managers? 
Paradoxically, we believe that such market 
deviations make it even more important for the 
executives of a company to understand the  
intrinsic value of its shares. This knowledge allows  
it to exploit any deviations, if and when they  
occur, to time the implementation of strategic 

decisions more successfully. Here are some 
examples of how corporate managers can take 
advantage of market deviations:

 — issuing additional share capital when the stock 

market attaches too high a value to the company’s 
shares relative to their intrinsic value

 — repurchasing shares when the market 

underprices them relative to their intrinsic value

 — paying for acquisitions with shares instead of 

cash when the market overprices them relative 
to their intrinsic value

 — divesting particular businesses at times when 

trading and transaction multiples are higher than 
can be justified by underlying fundamentals

Bear two things in mind. First, we don’t recommend 
that companies base decisions to issue or repurchase 
their shares, to divest or acquire businesses, or  
to settle transactions with cash or shares solely on 
an assumed difference between the market  
and intrinsic value of their shares. Instead, these 
decisions must be grounded in a strong business 
strategy driven by the goal of creating shareholder 
value. Market deviations are more relevant as 
tactical considerations when companies time and 

7  Marc H. Goedhart, Timothy M. Koller, and Zane D. Williams, “Living with lower market expectations,” McKinsey Quarterly, November 1, 2003.

50

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionexecute such decisions—for example, when  
to issue additional capital or how to pay for a 
particular transaction.

Second, managers should be wary of analyses 
claiming to highlight market deviations. Most of the 
alleged cases that we have come across in our  
client experience proved to be insignificant or even 
nonexistent, so the evidence should be compelling. 
Furthermore, the deviations should be significant  
in both size and duration, given the capital and time 
needed to take advantage of the types of oppor-
tunities listed previously.

Provided that a company’s share price eventually 
returns to its intrinsic value in the long run, managers 
would benefit from using a discounted-cash-flow 
approach for strategic decisions. What should 
matter is the long-term behavior of the share price 
of a company, not whether it is undervalued by  
5 or 10 percent at any given time. For strategic 
business decisions, the evidence strongly suggests 
that the market reflects intrinsic value.

companies to change their focus from increasing 
shareholder value to a broader focus on all 
stakeholders, including customers, employees, 
suppliers, and local communities. 

No question, the complexity of managing the 
interests of myriad owners and stakeholders in a 
modern corporation demands that any reform 
discussion begin with a large dose of humility and 
tolerance for ambiguity in defining the purpose  
of business. But we believe the current debate has 
muddied a fundamental truth: creating shareholder 
value is not the same as maximizing short-term 
profits—and companies that confuse the two often 
put both shareholder value and stakeholder 
interests at risk. Indeed, a system focused on 
creating shareholder value from business isn’t the 
problem; short-termism is. Great managers don’t 
skimp on safety, don’t make value-destroying 
investments just because their peers are doing it, 
and don’t use accounting or financial gimmicks  
to boost short-term profits, because ultimately such 
moves undermine intrinsic value. 

What’s needed at this time of reflection on the 
virtues and vices of capitalism is a clearer definition 
of shareholder value creation that can guide 
managers and board directors, rather than blurring 
their focus with a vague stakeholder agenda. We

The guiding principle of business value creation is 
a refreshingly simple construct: companies that 
grow and earn a return on capital that exceeds their 
cost of capital create value. The financial crisis of 
2007–08 and the Great Recession that followed are 
only the most recent reminders that when managers, 
boards of directors, and investors forget this guiding 
principle, the consequences are disastrous—so 
much so, in fact, that some economists now call into 
question the very foundations of shareholder-
oriented capitalism. Confidence in business has 
tumbled.1 Politicians and commentators are  
pushing for more regulation and fundamental 
changes in corporate governance. Academics and 
even some business leaders have called for

do believe that companies are better able to deliver 
long-term value to shareholders when they consider 
stakeholder concerns; the key is for managers to 
examine those concerns systematically for 
opportunities to do both.

What does it mean to create 
shareholder value?
If investors knew as much about a company as its 
managers, maximizing its current share price  
might be equivalent to maximizing value over time. In 
the real world, investors have only a company’s 
published financial results and their own assess-
ment of the quality and integrity of its management 
team. For large companies, it’s difficult even for 
insiders to know how the financial results are 
generated. Investors in most companies don’t know 
what’s really going on inside a company or what 
decisions managers are making. They can’t know, 
for example, whether the company is improving its 
margins by finding more efficient ways to work or by 
simply skimping on product development, 
maintenance, or marketing. 

Since investors don’t have complete information, it’s 
not difficult for companies to pump up their share 
price in the short term. For example, from 1997 to 
2003, a global consumer-products company 
consistently generated annual growth in earnings 

per share (EPS) between 11 and 16 percent. 
Managers attributed the company’s success to 
improved efficiency. Impressed, investors  
pushed the company’s share price above that of  
its peers—unaware that the company was 
shortchanging its investment in product develop-
ment and brand building to inflate short-term  
profits, even as revenue growth declined. In 2003, 
managers were compelled to admit what they’d 
done. Not surprisingly, the company went through a 
painful period of rebuilding, and its stock price  
took years to recover. 

In contrast, the evidence makes it clear that 
companies with a long strategic horizon create more 
value. The banks that had the insight and courage to 
forgo short-term profits during the real-estate 
bubble earned much better returns for shareholders 
over the longer term.2 Oil and gas companies known  
for investing in safety outperform those that haven’t. 
We’ve found, empirically, that long-term revenue 
growth—particularly organic revenue growth—is the 
most important driver of shareholder returns for 
companies with high returns on capital (though not 
for companies with low returns on capital).3 We’ve 
also found a strong positive correlation between 
long-term shareholder returns and investments in 
R&D—evidence of a commitment to creating  
value in the longer term.4 

The evidence makes it clear that 
companies with a long strategic horizon 
create more value.

The real business of business

The weight of such evidence and our experience 
supports a clear definition of what it means to create 
shareholder value, which is to create value for  
the collective of all shareholders, present and future. 
This means managers should not take actions  
to increase today’s share price if they will reduce it 
down the road. It’s the task of management and  
the board to have the courage to make long-term 
value-creating decisions despite the short- 
term consequences. 

Can stakeholder interests be reconciled? 
Much recent criticism of shareholder-oriented 
capitalism has called on companies to focus on a 
broader set of stakeholders, not just shareholders. 
It’s a view that has long been influential in conti-
nental Europe, where it is frequently embedded in 
the governance structures of the corporate  
form of organization. And we agree that for most 
companies anywhere in the world, pursuing  
the creation of long-term shareholder value requires 
satisfying other stakeholders as well.

We would go even further. We believe that companies 
dedicated to value creation are healthier and more 
robust—and that investing for sustainable growth 
also builds stronger economies, higher living 
standards, and more opportunities for individuals. 
Our research shows, for example, that many 
corporate-social-responsibility initiatives also create 
shareholder value, and managers should seek  
out such opportunities.5 For example, IBM’s free web-
based resources on business management not  
only help to build small and medium-size enterprises 
but also improve IBM’s reputation and relationships  
in new markets and develop relationships with 
potential customers. In another case, Novo Nordisk’s 
“Triple Bottom Line” philosophy of social responsibility, 
environmental soundness, and economic viability 
has led to programs to improve diabetes care in China. 
According to the company, its programs have 

burnished its brand, added to its market  
share, and increased sales—at the same time as 
improving physician education and patient 
outcomes. Similarly, Best Buy’s efforts to reduce 
attrition among women employees not only lowered 
turnover among women by more than 5 percent,  
it also helped them create their own support 
networks and build leadership skills. 

But what should be done when the interests of 
stake holders don’t naturally complement those of  
a company, for instance, when it comes to questions 
of employee compensation and benefits, supplier 
management, and local community relationships? 
Most advocates of managing for stakeholders 
appear to argue that companies can maximize value 
for all stakeholders and shareholders simulta-
neously—without making trade-offs among them. 
This includes, for example, Cornell Law School 
professor Lynn Stout’s book, The Shareholder  
Value Myth,6 in which Stout argues persuasively that 
nothing in US corporate law requires companies  
to focus on shareholder value creation. But her 
argument that putting shareholders first harms nearly 
everyone is really an argument against short-
termism, not a prescription for how to make trade-
offs. Similarly, R. Edward Freeman, a professor  
at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of 
Business, has written at length proposing a 
stakeholder value orientation. In his recent book, 
Managing for Stakeholders, he and his coauthors 
assert that “there is really no inherent conflict 
between the interests of financiers and other 
stakeholders.”7 John Mackey, founder and co-CEO 
of Whole Foods, recently wrote Conscious 
Capitalism,8 in which he, too, asserts that there are 
no trade-offs to be made.

Such criticism is naive. Strategic decisions often 
require myriad trade-offs among the interests  
of different groups that are often at odds with one 
another. And in the absence of other principled

cost, and the economy benefits when

employees move to new jobs with more 
competitive companies.

guidelines for such decisions, when there are trade-
offs to be made, prioritizing long-term value  
creation is best for the allocation of resources and 
the health of the economy. 

Consider employee stakeholders. A company that 
tries to boost profits by providing a shabby work 
environment relative to competitors, underpaying 
employees, or skimping on benefits will have trouble 
attracting and retaining high-quality employees. 
Lower-quality employees can mean lower-quality 
products, reducing demand and hurting reputation. 
More injury and illness can invite regulatory  
scrutiny and more union pressure. More turnover  
will inevitably increase training costs. With today’s 
more mobile and more educated workforce, such a 
company would struggle in the long term against 
competitors offering more attractive environments. 
If the company earns more than its cost of capital,  
it might afford to pay above-market wages and still 
prosper—and treating employees well can  
be good business. But how well is well enough? A 
stakeholder focus doesn’t provide an answer.  
A shareholder focus does. Pay wages that are just 
enough to attract quality employees and keep  
them happy and productive, pairing those with a 
range of nonmonetary benefits and rewards. 

Or consider how high a price a company should 
charge for its products. A shareholder focus would 
weigh price, volume, and customer satisfaction  

to determine a price that creates the most 
shareholder value. However, that price would also 
have to entice consumers to buy the products— 
and not just once but multiple times, for different 
generations of products. A company might still 
thrive if it charged lower prices, but there’s no way to 
determine whether the value of a lower price is 
greater for consumers than the value of a higher 
price to its shareholders. Finally, consider whether 
companies in mature, competitive industries  
should keep open high-cost plants that lose money 
just to keep employees working and prevent 
suppliers from going bankrupt. To do so in a 
globalizing industry would distort the allocation of 
resources in the economy. 

These can be agonizing decisions for managers and 
are difficult all around. But consumers benefit  
when goods are produced at the lowest possible 
cost, and the economy benefits when unproductive 
plants are closed and employees move to new  
jobs with more competitive companies. And while 
it’s true that employees often can’t just pick  
up and relocate, it’s also true that value-creating 
companies create more jobs. When examining 
employment, we found that the European and US 
companies that created the most shareholder  
value in the past 15 years have shown stronger 
employment growth.9

Short-termism runs deep
What’s most relevant about Stout’s argument,  
and that of others, is its implicit criticism of short-
termism—and that is a fair critique of today’s 
capitalism. Despite overwhelming evidence linking 
intrinsic investor preferences to long-term value 
creation,10 too many managers continue to plan and 
execute strategy, and then report their performance 
against shorter-term measures, EPS in particular. 

As a result of their focus on short-term EPS, major 
companies often pass up value-creating opportu-
nities. In a survey of 400 CFOs, two Duke University 
professors found that fully 80 percent of the CFOs 
said they would reduce discretionary spending on 
potentially value-creating activities such as 
marketing and R&D in order to meet their short-term 
earnings targets.11 In addition, 39 percent said  
they would give discounts to customers to make 
purchases this quarter, rather than next, in  
order to hit quarterly EPS targets. Such biases 
shortchange all stakeholders.

As an illustration of how executives get caught up in 
a short-term EPS focus, consider our experience 
with companies analyzing a prospective acquisition. 
The most frequent question managers ask is 
whether the transaction will dilute EPS over the first 
year or two. Given the popularity of EPS as a 
yardstick for company decisions, you might think 
that a predicted improvement in EPS would be  
an important indication of an acquisition’s potential 
to create value. However, there is no empirical 
evidence linking increased EPS with the value 
created by a transaction.12 Deals that strengthen 
EPS and deals that dilute EPS are equally likely  
to create or destroy value.

If such fallacies have no impact on value, why do 
they prevail? The impetus for short-termism varies. 
Some executives argue that investors won’t let  
them focus on the long term; others fault the rise of 
shareholder activists in particular. Yet our research 
shows that even if short-term investors cause  
day-to-day fluctuations in a company’s share price 
and dominate quarterly earnings calls, longer- 
term investors are the ones who align market prices 
with intrinsic value.13 Moreover, the evidence shows 
that, on average, activist investors strengthen  
the long-term health of the companies they pursue, 
often challenging existing compensation structures, 
for example, that encourage short-termism.14 
Instead, we often find that executives themselves or 
their boards are usually the source of short-termism. 
A 2013 survey of more than 1,000 executives and 
board members found, for example, that most cited 
their own executive teams and boards (rather than 
investors, analysts, and others outside the 
company) as the greatest sources of pressure for 
short-term performance.15 

The results can defy logic. We recently participated 
in a discussion with a company pursuing a major 
acquisition about whether the deal’s likely earnings 
dilution was important. One of the company’s 
bankers opined that he knew any impact on EPS 
would be irrelevant to value, but he used it as a 
simple way to communicate with boards of directors. 
Elsewhere, we’ve heard company executives 
acknowledge that they, too, doubt that the impact 
on EPS is so important—but they use it anyway, 
they say, for the benefit of Wall Street analysts. 
Investors also tell us that a deal’s short-term impact 
on EPS is not that important. Apparently everyone 
knows that a transaction’s short-term impact on EPS 
doesn’t matter, yet they all pay attention to it.

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionShareholder capitalism won’t solve all 
social issues
There are some trade-offs that company managers 
can’t make—and neither a shareholder nor a 
stakeholder approach to governance can help. This 
is especially true when it comes to issues that  
affect people who aren’t immediately involved with 
the company as investors, customers, or suppliers. 
These so-called externalities—parties affected  
by a company who did not choose to be so—are often 
beyond the ken of corporate decision making 
because there is no objective basis for making 
trade-offs among parties. 

If, for example, climate change is one of the largest 
social issues facing the world, then one natural 
place to look for a solution is coal-fired power plants, 
among the largest man-made sources of carbon 
emissions. But how are the managers of a coal-
mining company to make all the trade-offs needed 
to begin solving our environmental problems? If a 
long-term shareholder focus led them to anticipate 
potential regulatory changes, they should modify 
their investment strategies accordingly; they may not 
want to open new mines, for example. But if the 
company abruptly stopped operating existing ones, 
not only would its shareholders be wiped out but  
so would its bondholders (since bonds are often held 
by pension funds). All of its employees would be  
out of work, with magnifying effects on the entire 
local community. Second-order effects would be 
unpredictable. Without concerted action among all 
coal producers, another supplier could step up  
to meet demand. Even with concerted action, power 

plants might be unable to produce electricity, idling 
their workers and causing electricity shortages  
that undermine the economy. What objective criteria 
would any individual company use to weigh the 
economic and environmental trade-offs of such 
decisions—whether they’re privileging shareholders 
or stakeholders? 

In some cases, individual companies won’t be able 
to satisfy all stakeholders. For any individual 
company, the complexity of addressing universal 
social issues such as climate change leaves us  
with an unresolved question: If not them, then who? 
Some might argue that it would be better for the 
government to develop incentives, regulations, and 
taxes, for example, to encourage a migration  
away from polluting sources of energy. Others may 
espouse a free-market approach, allowing  
creative destruction to replace aging technologies 
and systems with cleaner, more efficient sources  
of power. 

Shareholder capitalism has taken its lumps in recent 
years, no question. And given the complexity of  
the issues, it’s unlikely that either the shareholder  
or stakeholder model of governance can be 
analytically proved superior. Yet we see in our work 
that the shareholder model, thoughtfully embraced 
as a collective approach to present and future  
value creation, is the best at bridging the broad  
and varied interests of shareholders and 
stakeholders alike.

Strategic combinations  
and divestitures

Corporate acquisitions, mergers, combinations, 
and divestitures have developed over centuries, 
together with corporations themselves. The 
goal has consistently been value creation.

There is no question that a combination of two 
companies can create synergies—which is  
why an acquirer needs to be diligent, and artful, 
in realizing them. A thoughtful acquirer also 
understands that its determination is about more 
than just the synergies it can realize from the 
deal. It weighs the value that could have been 
realized for the corporation and its shareholders  
if the deal price (and costs) were invested in  
other initiatives, used for share repurchases, 
or released as dividends to shareholders.

Companies are more likely to be successful 
dealmakers when they have a strategy-based 

perspective, develop a robust M&A capability,  
and think in terms of long-term value creation.  
A company may create more value by divesting 
through selling, splitting off, or spinning off 
businesses for which it isn’t the best owner 
(assuming that the price received is fair value).  
A company may be best served by entering  
into a joint venture or alliance. Or, of course,  
the planned acquisition may make the most 
sense after all—not least by helping a company 
improve its digital capabilities or enter an 
emerging market—so long as value-creating 
fundamentals are adhered to. While forgoing 
deals and choosing to grow organically is also 
always an option (and may be the best decision  
for a company given its unique circumstances),  
in the aggregate, companies that keep a 
dynamic portfolio have serially outperformed 
those that do not.

Why you’ve got to put your 
portfolio on the move 

We analyzed hundreds of companies around the world across a decade-
long business cycle. The conclusion? Winners change their business mix 
year after year. Laggards sit still.

global public companies between 2007 and 2017, 
through a long cycle of downturn, recovery, and 
growth. Our research makes the case for dynamic 
portfolio management and reveals five critical 
principles (based on the outperformers’ best 
practices) for actively reallocating assets: 

1.  Be consistent. The outperformers rotate their 

portfolios steadily, not wildly, and avoid keeping 
them fixed in place.

2.  Move with the market. The outperformers 
identify how headwinds and tailwinds are 
shifting, and they deploy resources aggressively 
to seize potential value-creation opportunities.

3.  Use transactions to speed your way.  

The outperformers in our research account  
for an outsize share of M&A-transaction  
value during the period studied, and they favor  
a programmatic approach to M&A.1

4.  Focus on acquisitions at the perimeter of your 
portfolio. The outperformers use M&A to  
seize new opportunities in existing but secondary 
businesses—that is, outside, but not too far 
outside, of their core sectors.

Every CEO will ask, at least once, “Which business 
should this company be in?” But the best know it 
can’t be a one-time question; they know the answer 
will keep changing over time. These executives 
consistently put their companies’ portfolios of 
businesses on the move—and outperformance 
tends to follow. The reverse holds true as well:  
CEOs who rarely ask the question end up with 
static portfolios. The market moves on, and  
their company doesn’t. 

For many companies, sitting still can be a bad option. 
We know because we have measured. We analyzed 
the detailed financial results of more than 1,000 

1   A company that takes a programmatic approach to M&A makes roughly two or more small or midsize deals in a year, with a meaningful target 

market capitalization acquired over a ten-year period (the median of the total market capitalization acquired across all deals is 15 percent). See 
Jeff Rudnicki, Kate Siegel, and Andy West, “How lots of small M&A deals add up to big value,” McKinsey Quarterly, July 12, 2019.

5.  When the going gets tough, go harder. Our 

research reveals that context matters: how you 
stack up against your competitors affects  
how hard you need to pull on all the levers we 
have outlined. We found that companies in  
the lowest quintile of performance did better 
when they pulled even harder.

Interestingly, these lessons proved sound in both 
good times and bad. They are also harder to apply 
than it seems: challenging economic conditions  
and cognitive biases that get in the way of good 
decision making can conspire to keep executives 
(and their portfolios) in a state of inertia. The reality  
is, however, that far more CEOs and investors will 
complain that companies shifted port folios too little 
or too late than will gripe about the opposite. The 
data are with you if you decide to put your portfolio 
on the move. 

The business case for portfolio change
There’s a lot of literature available on corporate 
portfolio management, but it almost never addresses 
the business case for why portfolio changes improve 
performance or how to go through the diffi cult  
task of actually shifting the business mix. With such 
business realities in mind, we analyzed reams  
of reported data. We sought out the links between 
changes in companies’ portfolios and actual 
performance results. More important, we sought 

conclusions that held true across market cycles. 
Five core lessons emerged from this study.

1. Be consistent
Our research revealed a Goldilocks rate of portfolio 
rotation that is neither too low nor too high but just 
right to produce outperformance. When we drilled 
down on a controlled subset of our studied 
companies, we found that about half kept their 
portfolios mostly static, refreshing them by  
fewer than ten percentage points over our studied 
ten-year period. Their portfolio mixes at the end  
of the period were similar to what they had been at 
the start. This group barely moved the needle in 
average annual excess total shareholder returns 
(TSR). Another group, comprising about a quarter  
of the companies, refreshed their portfolios by  
more than 30 percent age points over the decade; 
they actually produced slightly negative annual 
excess TSR (Exhibit 1). 

The remaining 23 percent of the companies we 
studied registered a refresh rate between 10 and  
30 percent. This last group delivered results  
that were just right—outperforming the others in 
excess TSR by, on average, 5.2 percent per annum. 
For a hypothetical company with $10 billion in 
revenues, a just-right rate of portfolio rotation would 
mean moving between $1 billion and $3 billion  
over ten years.

Of course, even within the range we identified, the 
right refresh rate will be different for companies, 
depending on industry and other factors. One high 
performer we studied, today a global logistics 
company, had operated substantial depository-
credit and retail-banking businesses through  
the first decade of the 2000s. Those business units 
accounted for more than 15 percent of total 
company revenue in 2007. But between 2007 and 
2017, the company exited banking and expanded  
its presence in supply chain logistics and parcel and 
e-commerce delivery instead—areas that each  
grew to represent about 50 percent of its sales by 
2017. This added up to a refresh rate of 16 percent, 
which put the company in the sweet spot that marks 
TSR high performers.

2. Move with the market
We created a baseline of industry momentum to  
con sider how a company’s portfolio would have  
evolved had each of its business units performed in 
line with its pure-play peers. This allowed us to  
measure whether changes within a portfolio either 
sped up or slowed down performance. The sum  
of a com pany’s moves for each of its business units 
represents total portfolio momentum (Exhibit 2).

When we examined the impact of portfolio 
momentum on a portion of our broader data set,  
we found that the one-third of companies that  
had begun the ten-year study period with positive 
industry momentum did well, with annual excess 
TSR of 4.4 percent; they had started in the fast lane  

62

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionand remained there. The companies that had started 
in the slow lane and moved into the fast lane—for 
example, a life-sciences conglomerate that shifted 
capital to testing and treatment—reached the end  
of the ten years in reasonable shape, with excess TSR 
growth of 1.7 percent per year. But the companies 
that began in a slow-growing industry and stayed 
there delivered a negative average excess TSR over 
the measured period. 

The best companies plumb market insights to 
forecast which industries and markets are likely to  
thrive, and they actively configure their portfolios to 
take advantage of those projected tailwinds. 
Consider the journey of one company, now a leading 
global provider of financial research and analytics.  
In 2007, 40 percent of its revenues came, collectively, 
from its publishing and education businesses; its 
financial-research arm contributed about one-third 
of the company’s top line, and its data and analytics 
businesses accounted for the rest. Seeing the 
challenges ahead for the publishing industry as a 
whole, the company sold its publishing and 
education businesses to private-equity investors 
and doubled down on financial research and 
analytics. By 2017, slightly more than half of the 
company’s reve nues were derived from financial 
research, and its financial-data-solutions business 
reached about 50 percent of the top line. These 
moves were ahead of the tide: between 2007 and 
2017, the average economic profit of companies 
involved in information provision increased  
by $1.4 billion, while that of companies involved in 
publishing declined by $73 million. Veering out  
of the slow lane of pub lish ing and into the fast lane 
of financial data helped contribute $400 million  
of the $850 million in economic-profit lift that the 
company realized over that period.

3. Use transactions to speed your way
M&A and divestitures are essential for positioning 
companies for value creation. But it’s critical to 
understand that different approaches to M&A will 
produce different outcomes over a ten-year  
period. A company that takes the program matic 
approach to M&A makes roughly two or more  
small or midsize deals in a year, acquiring a mean-
ingful total market capitalization over a ten-year  

period (the median is 15 percent of total market 
capi talization acquired across all deals). In the  
large-deal approach, regardless of how many deals 
a company does, if an individual deal is larger  
than 30 percent of the acquiring company’s market 
capitalization, most of its portfolio story is told  
by this one large bet. Selective M&A involves doing 
deals, but their value often doesn’t add up to a 
meaningful proportion of a company’s market 
capitalization at the end of a ten-year period. And in 
the organic approach, a company makes one deal  
or fewer every three years, and the cumulative value 
of the deals is less than 2 percent of the acquirer’s 
market capitalization.

When we looked at the companies that were 
operating at the Goldilocks refresh rate of between 
10 and 30 percent over ten years, programmatic 
M&A appeared to be the optimal path. Indeed, the 
companies in our sample that used programmatic 
M&A delivered an average excess TSR of 6.2 percent 
per year. We found similar outperformance when it 
came to changing industry lanes: of the companies 
that used transactions to move into high-growth 
industries, those that relied on a programmatic 
approach averaged 3.7 percent in annual excess TSR 
compared with –0.5 percent for companies that 
attempted this using selective M&A and 1.2 percent 
for companies using the large-deal approach. 

A global industrial company, for example, divested 
numerous businesses in which it lacked a competitive 
advantage and made more than 50 transactions 
between 2008 and 2017, posting a refresh rate of 
29 percent. Its discipline paid off. The company’s 
excess TSR versus that of its peers over the same 
period was 9 percent.

Programmatic M&A may not be right for every 
company in every industry, but pursuing a steady 
stream of deals can give a company access to  
the latest market intelligence and improve its 
transaction and integration capabilities. Deals won’t 
succeed all of the time, but doing them as part of  
a regular business cadence can enforce portfolio-
management discipline, help teams get smarter 
about industry levers and trends, and engender 
confidence from investors. 

63

Why you’ve got to put your portfolio on the move4. Focus acquisitions at the perimeter  
of your portfolio
We categorized the acquisitions of the companies  
in our 2007–17 data set in one of four ways: adding 
to its primary industry segment; adding to an 
existing, secondary industry segment; buying into  
a segment adjacent to an existing business; or 
stepping out into an unrelated industry. We found 
that companies that made acquisitions to shore  
up existing but secondary businesses registered  
the best results, returning an average of 1.6 percent  
in annual excess TSR (Exhibit 3). That said, a 
company’s existing industry context turned out to 
be critical. Those that started in well-performing 
industries did the best in pursuing M&A within their 

core industries—not surprising, since they had  
little reason to shift out of their fast lanes. Conversely, 
those that needed to change lanes got the  
biggest boost when they aimed further from their 
core businesses. 

Value creation can be a multistep process, of course. 
Consider one multinational chemical company. At  
the start of our study period, it was primarily a basic- 
chemicals company, operating in a sector in which 
larger US- and Middle East–based compet itors had 
far greater scale. The company recognized that 
specialty chemicals—particularly nutritional ones,  
in which it already had a small footprint—could  
pro vide faster growth. Over a decade, it made

multiple acquisitions to extend its presence in the 
nutrition business. In parallel, it exited businesses 
such as rubber, fertilizers, and energy, raising some 
$1.6 billion from its divestments. Those moves 
enabled the company to deliver more than 6 percent 
annual excess TSR. 

5. When the going gets tough, go harder
According to our analysis, the worse your starting 
point is, the more urgent it becomes to shift to  
a faster track. Our research showed that bottom-
quintile companies (by economic-profit performance) 
benefited the most from aggressive reallocation  
and higher-intensity M&A. The numbers revealed 
that step-out M&A, which is usually considered 
higher risk than acquisitions closer to the core, is 
often a better option than modest portfolio shifts are 
for companies that are at the back of the pack. 

Going harder paid off in spades for a large global 
packaging company. In 2009, after several years of 
sluggish performance, the company, then much 
smaller, surprised industry observers by pulling off an 
ambitious acquisition of a multinational conglom-
erate’s packaging unit. The conglomerate wanted to 
divest the noncore business unit after it had 
determined it was no longer the best owner. Through 
the deal, the packaging company boosted its  
growth and margin trajectory and realized a decade 
of outstanding shareholder returns. It was also a 

“bet the company” moment. Indeed, without the 
conviction to go hard on portfolio changes, the 
smaller company may well have become a take over 
target itself.

A story of from–to
The metrics on portfolio change speak volumes.  
Yet too many organizations still incline toward inertia. 
As our research shows, around half of sampled 
companies continue to change their business 
portfolios barely, if at all.2 There are several proven 
practices for getting portfolios moving: 

 — Shift the default. Whether we admit it or not,  
we fall in love with what we have. To break the 
spell, approach portfolio management as 
private-equity firms do, with the knowledge that 
most businesses must be sold or put on the 
block eventually. Having the conversation about 
“Why are we entitled to own this asset?”  
instead of “Should we sell it?” can help shift 
perspective in a way that generates a healthy 
and balanced debate. 

 — Drive conviction. When there’s a difference of 
opinion about which strategic actions are 
required, leaders typically agree to wait a bit 
longer—surely a turnaround is right around  
the bend. Better to be clear about your strategy

Why you’ve got to put your portfolio on the moveand pursue it with conviction: if a growth 
opportunity is emerging at the perimeter, your 
company should be programmed to go out  
and capture it. Recognize when one of your 
existing businesses is sputtering; admit that your 
company can’t be a leader in every sector it’s in. 
Follow the lead of one energy company, which 
established the rule that its corporate-planning 
team must identify 3 to 5 percent of the company’s 
assets for potential divestiture every year. 

 — Build a blueprint. When companies make deals, 
they tend to be reactive. A better approach  
is to start with a quantified vision of how many 
deals you want to make and then hew to a 
program to make that happen. Companies that 
succeed in making portfolio change a part  
of their DNA spell out a vision for their optimal 
portfolios, and they create detailed M&A 
blueprints to establish baselines of their market 
positions, ambitions, and gaps, as well as 
boundary conditions (such as types or sizes of 
deals) that will focus the scope of their deal 
searches. Progress toward the target portfolio is 
reviewed by the planning committee regularly, 
ideally quarterly, to ensure that transactions are 
purposeful and not opportunistic. 

 — Develop a machine. Sophisticated deal makers 
manage their M&A programs as core parts of 
business operations. They consider corporate 

planning in a comprehensive way, and they  
view M&A as an enduring capability, not as an 
occa sional event. For example, they conduct  
due diligence and integration planning at the 
same time—holding discussions early in the  
deal process about how to get “under the hood”  
of deal value and reimagine the opportunities that 
the acquired company could unleash once the 
deal is closed. They also have an integration plan, 
head count, and budget in place before the 
acquisition is closed, and they strive to fill in gaps 
in personnel or tools so that integration can 
begin immediately at closing.

Distinctive companies manage their business 
portfolios relentlessly, continually pursuing new 
opportunities to create value and systematically 
divesting business units that underperform.  
While not every moment is one for disruption, nor 
every sector or company ripe for M&A, the dearth of 
portfolio activity highlighted by our research 
suggests that too many companies and leaders are 
keeping their heads too far down. Business  
leaders must regularly reappraise portfolios—and 
then commit to move.

How lots of small M&A 
deals add up to big value

New research confirms that companies that regularly and systematically 
pursue moderately sized M&A deliver better shareholder returns than 
companies that don’t. 

by Jeff Rudnicki, Kate Siegel, and Andy West

That pattern is even more pronounced in today’s fast-
moving, increasingly uncertain business environment 
(see sidebar, “The staying power of programmatic 
acquisition”). A recent update of our research reflects 
the growing importance of placing multiple bets  
and being nimble with capital: between 2007 and 
2017, the programmatic acquirers in our data set  
of 1,000 global companies (or Global 1,000) achieved 
higher excess total shareholder returns than did 
industry peers using other M&A strategies (large 
deals, selective acquisitions, or organic growth).3 
What’s more, the alternative approaches seem to 
have underdelivered. Companies making selective 
acquisitions or relying on organic growth showed, on 
average, losses in excess total shareholder returns 
relative to peers (Exhibit 1).

The data also confirmed just how challenging it is for 
individual companies to make the transition to 
programmatic M&A from any of the other models we 
identified. For instance, none of the companies  
that followed an organic approach between 2004 
and 2014 had shifted to a programmatic model  
by the time we performed our latest analysis. And by

Nearly a decade ago, we set out to answer  
a critical management question: What type of 
M&A strategy creates the most value for large 
corporations? We crunched the numbers, and the 
answer was clear: pursue many small deals that 
accrue to a meaningful amount of market capital-
ization over multiple years instead of relying on 
episodic, “big bang” transactions.1 Between 1999 and 
2010, companies following this programmatic 
approach to M&A generally outperformed peers.2 

1   Werner Rehm, Robert Uhlaner, and Andy West, “Taking a longer-term look at M&A value creation,” McKinsey, January 1, 2012.
2  The definition of programmatic M&A is when a company makes more than two small or midsize deals in a year, with a meaningful target market 

capitalization acquired (median of 15 percent).

3  In the large-deal approach, a company makes one deal or more per year, and the target market capitalization is equal to or greater than  

30 percent of the acquirer’s market capitalization. In the selective approach, a company makes two or fewer deals per year, and the cumulative 
value of the deals is more than 2 percent of the acquirer’s market capitalization. In the organic approach, a company makes one deal or fewer 
every three years, and the cumulative value of the deals is less than 2 percent of the acquirer’s market capitalization.

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Edition2017, more than a quarter of those companies had 
dropped out of the Global 1,000 altogether because 
of takeovers and other factors. The story was similar 
among those companies we deemed selective 
acquirers (Exhibit 2).

When we looked even closer at the data, we saw 
some striking differences in what high-volume  
deal makers do relative to peers. For example, the 
programmatic acquirers were twice as likely as 
peers to estimate revenue and cost synergies at 
various stages of the deal-making process,  

and they were 1.4 times more likely than peers to 
have designated clear owners for each stage.4

These findings are consistent with our experience  
in the field, in which we see that programmatic 
acquirers have built up organizational infrastructures 
and established best practices across all stages  
of the M&A process—from strategy and sourcing  
to due diligence and integration planning to 
establishing the operating model. In this article, we 
will consider how programmatic acquirers typically 
manage each of these stages. 

The staying power of programmatic acquisition

In our ongoing research, we track the largest 
(by market capitalization) 1,000 global 
companies, measure excess total share-
holder returns they created com pared  
with industry peers, and look at the type of 

acquisition strategy these companies 
deployed. The data confirm that program-
matic acquirers continue to perform  
better than industry peers; indeed, the more 
deals a company did, the higher the 

probability that it would earn excess  
returns (exhibit). Precisely because these 
com panies are doing deals systematically, 
we believe they are building lasting, 
distinctive capabilities in M&A.

The programmatic model may not be the right fit for 
every company, of course. Some businesses may 
contend with organizational limitations or industry-
specific obstacles (consolidation trends and 
regulatory concerns, for instance). Regardless,  
it can be instructive for companies with any  
type of M&A program to understand how some 
companies are taking advantage of the 
programmatic approach. 

Strategy and sourcing
Most of the programmatic acquirers we interviewed 
said they work hard to connect their strategies  
with their M&A priorities. The hard work starts with  
a return to first principles: the development of a 
blueprint for bringing strategic goals into deal-
sourcing discussions. An effective M&A blueprint 
delineates the limitations of pursuing certain  
deals and provides a realistic snapshot of market 
trends—for instance, “Which market-shaping  
forces are the most promising within our sector,  
and how are our competitors likely to evolve?” 
Additionally, the M&A blueprint can help program-
matic acquirers identify whether or not they may  
be the best owner in any deal or transfer of assets—
for instance, “What are our sources of competitive 
advantage, and what capabilities are we trying  
to acquire?” Finally, the blueprint can help compa-
nies assess how realistic it may be to expect 
success from a deal—for instance, “Are assets 
readily available, or are they overpriced? Do  
we have the relationships required to carry out this 
transaction? Are regulatory constraints too much  
to overcome?”

These were the kinds of questions senior leaders  
at one consumer-products company asked 
themselves as part of a recent deal. The leadership 
team strongly believed the company needed to 
expand its presence in China and asked the M&A 
organization to identify potential acquisition  
targets. The debate over which regions to focus on 
went on for several weeks, until senior leaders  
and the M&A team realized they needed to revisit 
the base strategy. In a series of fact-finding 

meetings that took place over an eight-week 
period—and referring back to their M&A blueprint—
the senior leaders and the M&A organization 
identified the amount of capital required to meet 
their goals, specific market trends and customer 
segments in China, and the potential advantages the 
company could confer to a target (primarily, its 
global distribution network). Once senior leaders at 
the consumer-products company had systematically 
explored such questions, they were able to gain 
quick agreement on a handful of potential targets in 
specific regions, several of which had not even  
been mentioned during the initial discussions. 

Due diligence and integration planning
The programmatic acquirers we interviewed said 
they often tackle due diligence and integration 
planning simultaneously—holding discussions far 
ahead of closing about how to redefine roles, 
combine processes, or adopt new technologies. 
Having the right resources at the ready seems to be 
a key tenet for these companies. It was for one 
consumer-products company that, at the outset of 
its merger with a target, modeled the optimal 
sequence for migrating general and administrative 
tasks from both companies to a centralized  
shared-services group, thereby jump-starting  
the overall integration process.

Corporate culture and organizational health—of 
both the acquirer and target—also seem to be 
important concerns for programmatic acquirers. Our 
research shows that programmatic acquirers  
are more likely than peers to pay close attention  
to cultural factors during both diligence and 
integration processes.5 For instance, the integration 
team at one technology company closely tracked 
the balance of employees who would be selected for 
the combined entity from across both the parent 
company and the target. If any area of the business 
was not achieving a balance that matched the 
relative scale of the merger, team leaders intervened. 
Additionally, employee selections could not be 
approved without ratification from the integration 
team. If two candidates were deemed equally

suitable for a role, the team tilted its selection to the 
target-company candidate, recognizing that 
managers in the acquiring company likely already 
had a built-in unconscious bias in favor of the 
homegrown employee. If neither candidate was 
considered suitable, the team moved quickly to 
recruit externally.6 

M&A operating model
A programmatic approach won’t work if you don’t 
define the program and don’t treat M&A as  
an enduring capability rather than a project or 
occasional event. Our research shows that, 
compared with peers, programmatic acquirers often 
focus on building end-to-end M&A operating 
models with clear performance measures, incentives, 
and governance processes. For these companies, 
the devil is in the details. Potential acquisitions are 
not evaluated ad hoc, for instance. Instead all the 
decision makers and the criteria they are using are 
clearly defined and made transparent to all 
stakeholders. “If it’s truly a program, then for each 
type of opportunity, you need to say, here are the 
targets that would constitute a doubling down, here 
are the targets or products we’d like to have, and 
here are the targets for the distribution we want,” one 
partner at a private-equity company explained. “It 
has to be systematic.” 

To that end, one technology company treats M&A  
in much the same way it does customer acquisitions: 
it uses a customer-relationship-management-like 
tool to manage its M&A program. The tool is an 
online database of hundreds of companies that the 
technology company actively monitors as potential 
targets. Using a series of customizable dashboards, 
the corporate-development team updates the 
database and tracks statistics about acquired 
companies and which targets are in which phases  
of acquisition. (Business-unit leaders are also 
tasked with keeping this information up to date.) The 
corporate-development team generates reports,  
and the head of M&A analyzes the data and tracks 
progress on deals. The tool enables accountability 
across all phases of M&A; it is even invoked during 
executives’ performance reviews. 

A clear takeaway from our research is that practice 
still makes perfect. By building a dedicated M&A 
function, codifying learnings from past deals, and 
taking an end-to-end perspective on transactions, 
businesses can emulate the success of program-
matic acquirers—becoming as capable in M&A as 
they are in sales, R&D, and other disciplines that 
create outperformance relative to competitors.

The artful synergist, or 
how to get more value from 
mergers and acquisitions

Keeping your deal team small ensures confidentiality, but pinpointing 
synergies requires bringing more people on board. Here’s how to strike the 
right balance.

by Jeff Rudnicki, Ryan Thorpe, and Andy West

the mistake of clinging to too small a team late into 
the due-diligence stages of a deal. This overly 
conservative mind-set creates problems, leaving 
deal planners to perform their roles in isolation. 
Without others to challenge assumptions and 
cognitive biases,2 the planners’ synergy estimates, 
performance benchmarks, and cost and revenue 
targets can be off the mark. High-priority issues  
and complex integration challenges can get lumped 
together indiscriminately with lower-priority and 
simply managed ones—creating an adversarial, 
political, and highly emotional working environment. 
Business managers complain that their synergy 
targets are too high—when in fact, they often prove 
to be too low. And companies lose precious time as 
those tasked with implementing a deal try to 
reconstruct the expectations of those who planned 
it. This often squanders internal goodwill, organi-
zational buy-in, and even hard cash.

A more inclusive approach to estimating synergies 
can create more value and promote a culture of 
shared accountability and buy-in. But pulling more 
people into the process requires an artful balance of 
often-contradictory objectives. Managers must

Making sure that large M&A deals create value is as 
much about knowing whom to involve—and when—
as it is about knowing how to capture synergies.1 The 
larger the deal, the more critical the need to ensure 
confidentiality by keeping the team small during the 
early stages of planning. Such teams may lack 
breadth, but they’re sufficient to produce a rough 
valuation that allows planning to move ahead.

As planning progresses, more people eventually have 
to be involved. But many M&A practitioners make 

1   Our focus is on large deals (more than 30 percent of the acquirer’s size by revenues or market cap). Smaller deals are often different  

because they don’t affect most areas of the business, are often focused entirely—or not at all—on cost cutting, and lack the leadership and 
organizational challenges of large deals.

promote both transparency and confidentiality, as 
well as embrace both skepticism and a shared vision, 
all while keeping a ruthless focus on efficiency.

A more inclusive approach to 
estimating synergies
As smart as many executives are about keeping  
their M&A teams small in the beginning,3 they make 
the wrong trade-off as they get deeper into  
the diligence process. As a result, they lay out a 
framework for integration and develop synergy 
estimates based on the insights of a small, isolated 
team—without the buy-in they need from critical 
stakeholders. These include not just the executives 
who will carry the heaviest burden of integration 
execution but also the full complement of a CEO’s 
direct reports.

In our experience, the diligence process can’t 
happen in a vacuum. Synergies vary from deal to deal. 
Even a straightforward synergy target for general 
and administrative costs can vary significantly 
depending on the current state, the assumptions, 
and the appetite for change. Some functions,  
such as IT systems or human resources, can enable, 
delay, or completely prevent other functions  
from integrating, which renders synergy estimates 
meaningless. And functional leaders are often  
wary of committing to performance and budget 
targets they haven’t seen before. Imagine the 
pushback from a manager at one acquirer when he 
learned he’d be expected to absorb a 40 percent  
cut in staffing—instead of adding people, as he had 
expected, given the complexity of the transaction.

Involving functional-group managers on a deal-
specific basis can help, especially when framing the 
cost and revenue assumptions behind the valuation 
model for due diligence. These managers can  
help articulate the risks of cutting too deeply or too 
quickly, for example, or identify opportunities to 
build on an existing transformation program. And 
getting their input early on can create a shared 
understanding of the final synergy targets—even 
setting a higher cognitive anchor for them.

Such dialogue needn’t take a lot of time. A few 
targeted conversations and a straightforward 
information request made over the course of a few 
short days can dramatically increase the level of 
insight. That was the case for one acquirer when it 
sought to buy a business in a deal that included 
transitional service agreements with its former 
parent. The acquiring company’s CIO helped the M&A 
diligence team review the transition timelines, which 
shed important light on the associated costs and 
risks of the service agreements. Bringing the CIO 
into the process allowed her to get a head start  
on integration planning, which is critical for systems 
that enable synergies elsewhere. It also helped her 
accept the final synergy targets, even though they 
were higher than for other functions. Moreover,  
the dialogue between the CIO and the team revealed 
that the baseline costs of the transitional service 
agreements were unreasonably high—and the 
synergies could be higher if the business quickly 
transitioned to the acquirer’s systems.

Many managers we’ve talked with find such dialogue 
so successful that they use it for all large deals, 
bringing most, if not all, top leaders into parts of  
the diligence discussion. Even for smaller deals,  
the company typically includes some subset of top 
leadership to validate costs and deal assumptions 
and to pressure-test risks.

Balancing competing objectives
The advantages of a more inclusive team doesn’t 
mean extending an invitation to a cast of thousands. 
But it does come with risks—especially for larger 
deals. Not only is maintaining confidentiality more 
difficult, but larger teams also tend to move more 
slowly and are more likely to include skeptics who 
challenge a deal’s strategic rationale. Balancing 
these interests tests managers’ cleverness in finding 
the overlap between seemingly exclusive objectives.

Transparency and confidentiality
We have found it is possible to be both transparent 
and confidential. For example, the CEO of one serial 
acquirer balanced the two interests this way.

We have found it is possible to be both 
transparent and confidential.

First, she expressed a very clear perspective on the 
importance of large deals and the appropriate role 
of executives in evaluating those deals—creating a 
time and place for open dialogue and promoting 
explicit challenges to a deal’s rationale. But then she 
made it clear that once a decision was made, 
everyone was expected to champion it.

As a result, the members of the executive team 
understood and respected their roles. They knew 
when they would be engaged, and they didn’t 
second-guess the process. This engendered a sense 
of trust that they would be aware of all important 
M&A efforts and would have a chance to react to 
potential deals before any became final. Their trust 
was affirmed over time, with each potential deal 
forming the basis for confidential discourse. Finally, 
the CEO herself stressed confidentiality. She  
chose a core M&A team she trusted. But she also 
established explicit repercussions for leaking.  
In one instance, a senior executive was let go after  
it became clear he was disclosing information  
about potential deals in the works to people 
throughout the organization.

have observed at least several direct reports to the 
CEO remaining skeptical throughout. The CEO must 
sell his or her direct reports on the strategic merits 
of a deal, through conversation—often one-on-one—
and through participation. There is no other way to 
form a productive team that will capture all the value 
possible from a deal. For smaller deals, similar 
obligations fall to division and business unit heads.

Productive teams will challenge aspects of the deal, 
such as strategic fit and synergies. But they do so 
with a mind-set of trying to make the deal work and 
creating the best possible outcome. With that  
mind-set, even the most stubborn skeptics can 
actually help bring about a better outcome. We have 
observed a sort of peer pressure at play in these 
situations, in which dedicated leaders help reinforce 
commitment among one another and among lower 
layers in the organization. CEOs can encourage this 
mind-set by surrounding themselves with those  
with diverse business backgrounds and by promot-
ing contrarian thinking and risk taking, often  
leading by example.

Skepticism within a shared vision
In our experience, few deals ever achieve a shared 
vision among the executive team. But proceeding 
without one can be destructive. Three months  
after the close of one recent deal, one senior exec-
utive launched an attack on his synergy target  
while explaining a shortfall in planned savings. Such 
exchanges were commonplace across the executive 
team. Later, the executive explained that the deal 
should never have been done in the first place and 
that he was worried about his career prospects  
after being involved in such a bungled deal.

For large deals, it is the CEO’s job alone to ensure 
that his or her executive team has a shared vision for 
the deal. This sounds simple, but in most deals, we 

Building efficient M&A processes
The best acquisitions aren’t the ones that close  
the fastest, but rather those in which the leadership 
team comes together to create the greatest  
amount of value. That takes time. To allow that time, 
a company must have ruthlessly efficient  
M&A processes.

To be efficient, companies must have a robust 
finance function with a transparent view into its own 
cost structure, the better to quickly interpret and 
categorize a target’s costs. In one recent merger, for 
example, financial planning was led by two capable 
and respected executives, who in only three weeks

combined baseline of performance across the two

across both companies to make sure they agreed 
with the baseline, the acquiring CFO was able  
to present synergy and financial targets for a dozen 
or so areas of the company less than a month  
into integration planning, three months before the 
deal closed.

This proactive approach allowed the leaders of each 
organization to apply their energies toward creating 
the leanest and most efficient organization they 
could, rather than iterating and debating the fact 
base and targets. The result was a process that  
was among the most efficient we have ever seen and 
that encouraged collaborative work across both 
organizations. We ultimately credit the acquiring 
CFO, who decided to invest in the right finance 
professionals to lead this effort.

Efficient M&A teams should also be able to learn 
from each deal. No set of best practices will  
ever replace the feel that great executives have for 
getting a deal done and getting value from it.  
This means an executive team must come together 
and review how past deals were done, not just  
how much they earned. And they must learn what 
others involved in the deal did, once that information 
can be shared freely.

Taking a more inclusive approach to deal making 
won’t eliminate tension from your company’s  
large M&A deals, and it won’t turn a bad acquisition 
into a good one. What it will do is create the 
conditions in which your management team can 
artfully build a good deal into a great one.

The telltale signs of 
successful digital deals

Digital M&A is challenging—and often a necessity for digital 
transformation. Sophisticated acquirers boost their odds by addressing 
the pain points that undermine outperformance.

by Tanguy Catlin and Brett May

They spend three times more on M&A (27 percent  
of their annual revenues, compared with 9 percent 
by others) and devote upward of 1.5 times more of 
their M&A activity to the acquisition of digital capa-
bilities and digital businesses (64 percent, compared 
with 39 percent for their peers), and ensure that 
software acquisitions are among their highest 
priorities. And that was before the COVID-19 crisis, 
which is making it even more important for many 
companies to rewire themselves in ways that some-
times necessitate acquiring digital capabilities. 

High-performing acquirers approach M&A in a 
programmatic way, from strategy to deal execution 
and through integration. You can often spot their 
work by what they don’t do: make unforced errors at 
key points in the deal life cycle. Sometimes, an 
acquiring company stumbles before it has even 
started, not thinking through its strategy or what 
types of assets and capabilities it needs to acquire. 
In other cases, the acquirer doesn’t sufficiently 
understand the technology it’s purchasing, or how 
to value it. And even when acquirers navigate  
the strategy and execution phases smoothly, they 
can still wind up foundering during integration. 

Sophisticated acquirers know the common trouble 
spots. Three categories of challenges—across 
strategy, execution, and integration—are particularly 
worthy of attention. In this article, we address these

The old saw that the best deals are the ones you 
don’t make doesn’t apply when it comes to digital 
acquisitions—you’ve got to make them, our research 
has consistently shown. You also need to do them 
well, and that can be challenging, because buying in 
the digital, analytics, and technology space—what 
we call “digital deals”—is different enough from 
undertaking conventional transactions to raise the 
odds of costly lapses.

In this article, we show how to overcome those 
challenges, and join the ranks of companies that have 
achieved exceptional performance by energizing 
their digital-transformation efforts with successful 
mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Digital leaders 
pursue M&A about twice as hard as everyone else.

challenges in turn, so that when your organization 
moves forward with its digital deals, as it must, it can 
avoid common errors before they happen (Exhibit 1). 

Strategic preparedness
Tried, trite, but true: luck really is the residue of 
design. So too is the negative: bad luck and poor 
outcomes follow ill-prepared—and sometimes 
downright absent—strategies. Don’t expect that a 
deal done on a whim will turn out to be a winner.  
An acquirer must rigorously consider what it hopes 
to accomplish, why an acquisition aligns with its 
direction, and what exactly it is buying. 

Be clear about the rationale 
As our colleagues have demonstrated, fortune in the 
digital age favors organizations that have bold, tightly 
integrated digital strategies.1 To succeed, digital 
reinvention must go beyond merely acquiring stand-
alone products and services to bring to market. An 
acquisition should follow your strategic plan. 

So be clear about the strategic gaps you are trying 
to fill. Why do this deal? Is it for market leadership? 
Technical capabilities? Talent? Some combination of 
those objectives, or perhaps for other strategic 
reasons? Just because a technology works, or is on 
track to work, doesn’t mean it’s the right asset for

your organization. Different assets, in turn, may look 
quite similar on their websites yet fulfill very different 
strategic needs. And you’re unlikely to recognize 
those disconnects if you haven’t been rigorous in 
spelling out the deal’s rationale. Articulate your 
strategy; then identify your target. 

goal, assumed by its senior leaders but not  
clearly spelled out to its business-development 
team, was to achieve both innovation and scale.  
This deal achieved only the first goal. Returns were 
compromised because the company hadn’t pursued 
assets more in line with its strategy.

It’s fine to make a trade-off between commercial 
scale and cash flow, on the one hand, and more 
speculative (though potentially pathbreaking) inno-
vation, on the other, so long as you know what you 
should be shopping for. This is why acquirers  
that buy profitable, mature assets and then expect 
game-changing innovation can wind up feeling 
frustrated. Other times, companies expecting imme-
diate growth or earnings accretion are disappointed 
when they buy compelling intellectual property (IP) 
with little commercial traction. Sophisticated 
acquirers know the difference. They make sure they 
are paying for what they need, not for what they 
don’t. If a deal, however attractive, doesn’t fill a 
demonstrated gap, the acquirer is setting itself up 
for disappointment. 

One technology services buyer, for example, wanted 
to beef up its DevOps portfolio and discovered a 
profitable software company that seemed to fit the 
bill. But most of the target’s revenues—and all of its 
profits—were derived from a mature, unrelated 
product with little strategic value to the acquirer. The 
target’s DevOps solution, while capable, turned  
out to be a niche product, with limited market size 
and upside potential. The acquirer’s strategic  

Commit to technical due diligence
Even if your strategy is clear, it will be compromised 
if what you buy from a technical perspective turns 
out to be not what you thought you were buying. The 
problem happens more than you may suspect. In our 
experience, technical due diligence is the single 
biggest differentiator of deals done well—or poorly. 
What’s more, technical due-diligence failures can 
usually be avoided. Almost always, the disappointed 
acquirer insufficiently vets the technology and 
discovers too late that it fails to work as advertised. 
Or the technology does work, but only in 
constrained environments, and won’t scale. In other 
cases, crucial parts of the IP turn out not to be 
owned by the seller. 

Some organizations do less technology due diligence 
on targets they plan to acquire for hundreds of 
millions of dollars than on companies they are 
evaluating (say, for an internal pilot program) for a 
fraction of the price. One reason is the necessary 
confidentiality associated with M&A. Large, market-
moving transactions require discretion—which can  
be problematic for digital deals if it inhibits leaders 
from bringing individuals with critical engineering 
know-how into the information loop. Further 

To succeed, digital reinvention must go 
beyond merely acquiring stand-alone 
products and services to bring to market. 
An acquisition should follow your 
strategic plan.

78

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editioncomplicating matters: some organizations may not 
even have the in-house capability to establish that 
the target can do what it purports to do. 

Seasoned acquirers always seek to evaluate the 
target’s technology before a deal. Digital M&A is a 
capability, and best-in-class acquirers treat it that 
way, with dedicated technology teams to stress-test 
prospective acquisitions. It’s ideal to be a customer 
before you become an acquirer; this element alone 
can dramatically reduce risk. If that’s not possible, 
do whatever you can to become well versed in the 
technology before you buy it, and understand how it 
will operate within your organization under real-world 
conditions. Digital deals aren’t plug and play. 

A case in point: one healthcare equipment 
manufacturer purchased an imaging technology 
company with sophisticated code that worked 
stand-alone but turned out to be incompatible with 
the technical architecture of the acquirer’s installed 
base. The expensive mistake could have been 
avoided had the acquirer simply tried experimenting 
with the target’s products. In another case, a 
communications-hardware manufacturer acquired a 
successful company that made remote-network-
monitoring software. It was a great product, and a 
great fit, but it had one great problem: it relied on 
software code that was licensed, but not owned, by 
the acquired company. Soon after the acquisition, 
the company that did own the code was itself acquired 
by one of the hardware company’s competitors. The 
code became unavailable as a result. The hardware 
company had to redevelop the missing IP at a cost of 
tens of millions of dollars and a 24-month delay.  
An avoidable due-diligence oversight doomed the 
investment’s returns. 

Financial perspective
Getting the valuation wrong can of course doom 
returns as well. Sophisticated acquirers take care to 
understand value from a range of perspectives— 
not only from the perspective of the acquirer, but 
also from that of the target and “the market.” 
Acquirers less familiar with digital M&A may fail to 
value a digital asset properly. That often stems from 
misconceptions about the value proposition.

Consider the sources of value
Because M&A in the digital, analytics, and techno-
logical space is so critical, it is usually expensive. 
“Underpaying” is unrealistic; bid too low, and you’ll 
probably miss out. But what does it mean to 
“overpay”? Consider one acquirer, which we’ll call 
Company X. At the time of an important deal, this 
organization was numbered among the most 
valuable technology companies in the world. It had 
experienced several years of impressive growth,  
and its talented workforce had an enviable 
reputation as an innovation engine. 

Just as Company X reached its highest valuation  
to date, it acquired a new software platform for  
$50 million. The platform had generated virtually no 
revenue when the deal closed but had the potential 
to complement the company’s software offering and 
reach a new market of mobile users. The platform 
produced no revenue over the year after the closing. 
Nor did it generate revenue the year after that  
or the following year as well—zero revenue, not just 
zero earnings, for three years. Did Company X 
misunderstand the target’s value proposition? Hardly. 
Company X was Google (now Alphabet), and the 
target was Android, today an immense platform that 
ships on over 80 percent of all new smartphones. In 
2018 alone, Google made $25 billion, enabled by 
Android’s massive installed base, from Google Play.

Value in the digital context is no different from value 
in other sectors—companies generate value  
when their return on invested capital exceeds their 
opportunity cost of capital. But the path from  
deal conception to value creation can be different 
enough that if you approach digital M&A valuation 
solely by traditional means, you’re liable to get  
an incomplete picture. When assessing digital 
acquisitions, take care to set clear expectations about 
synergies and time horizons. Revenue synergies 
typically matter more than cost cutting. Don’t over-
index on earnings; digital acquisitions made  
today may not increase cash flow for multiple 
quarters to come. If you’re buying a digital asset to 
strengthen your technological capabilities, recognize 
that financial results will manifest indirectly.

An acquirer may have a suite of products 
that has a gap; the right acquisition  
will make the entire suite more valuable, 
driving sales not only for the acquired 
product but also for adjacent products.

The digital whole really does exceed the sum of its 
parts. An acquirer may have a suite of products that 
has a gap; the right acquisition will make the entire 
suite more valuable, driving sales not only for the 
acquired product but also for adjacent products. For 
example, one IT hardware company purchased  
a security-services company and found revenues 
increased not just from the security products it 
could now offer but also from higher renewal rates 
for annual service contracts on the company’s  
core product. 

Expand your valuation tool kit
Pegging the appropriate value of a digital target is 
hard, and you do yourself no favors if you constrain 
your valuation methods. As in any deal, you should 
always run a discounted-cash-flow (DCF) analysis. 
But in digital, that DCF should come in two flavors. 
The first should be from the point of view of the 
acquired company as a stand-alone entity, using 
target management’s current financial projections as 
a guide. The second should model what the target 
may be worth inside the acquirer. In this second 
scenario, some costs may be higher (for example, 
acquirers often have higher labor costs than start-up 
companies have). Yet there may also be both cost 
and revenue synergies, such as accelerating sales. 

The use of comparables, too, should go beyond the 
traditional. “Seven-times EBITDA” (or whatever  
your earnings comp may be) doesn’t make sense 

when you’re buying an early-stage technology—
comp on revenue instead. Moreover, get under the 
revenue-driver hood, using metrics specific to  
the target, such as multiples based on numbers of 
users or subscribers. 

At the same time, don’t fixate on a single comparable 
in isolation. Multiples are a spice. If you treat any  
one multiple or simple combination of multiples as 
the main ingredient, you’re likely to spoil the 
valuation broth. (Why, for example, pay a multiple  
on users if only a subset of users will purchase 
subscriptions? And why fixate on a multiple on 
subscriptions if the subscription price is not in line 
with market rates?) Yet multiples do provide a  
fuller flavor of the deal. They help set the parameters 
of a “fairway,” feeding into market baselines  
and meeting the target company’s expectations  
on price (Exhibit 2).

While you may encounter accounting issues such as 
potential write-downs in the treatment of the 
target’s service revenue, these shouldn’t influence 
your view of the deal, so long as actual cash flow  
is not affected. Be aware, though, that write-downs 
can occur and that you’ll need to understand the 
issue in detail in order to have clear investor commu-
ni cation at deal announcement. Understand, too, 
that costs nearly always go up when acquiring  
a digital start-up company. Start-up employees are 
often paid below market salaries in exchange for

stock options, and work in below-standard office 
spaces. That means the target’s earnings trajectory 
can flatten, at least in the short term, after the  
deal has closed. Revenues take time to grow, but 
expenses begin to bite immediately. Experienced 
acquirers factor this in when they create their 
earnings forecasts.

Execution follow-through
Unfortunately, even when the strategic, financial, and 
accounting stars align, before-deal expectations  
and after-deal results may not. To better your odds 
for success, bear down on postclosing execution. 

Three types of unforced errors are among the most 
prevalent, and preventable.

Prioritize talent retention
It’s difficult to overstate the importance of talent 
retention. In digital M&A, you’re acquiring not just IP 
but also the skills of those who make that IP go. 
Software engineers are not always interchangeable 
in the ways that people in other skilled positions are. 
Retention incentives are common, which may  
add to the deal price. But scrimping on employee 
compensation can be a prescription for disaster. 
Don’t be pound foolish.

The telltale signs of successful digital deals

81

Very frequently in digital M&A, and as is common for 
companies that are start-ups or a few years older, 
you’ll be buying a business with different classes of 
shareholders. Depending upon how many rounds  
of financing a target has been through (and some-
times within a single round if the investors negotiate 
unique terms amongst themselves), you’ll be  
dealing with sellers who have disparate interests, 
incentives, and contractual rights, especially 
liquidation preferences. 

That’s why you should always ask for the target’s 
capitalization table, shareholder agreements, and 
other agreements between and among the  
company and its shareholders before landing on a 
final deal price. In some cases, small changes in 
price may disproportionately affect the attractiveness 
of a deal for one group of the seller’s shareholders 
over another. Several acquirers have encountered 
scenarios in which the target’s preferred series  
of investors made a tidy profit from selling at a given 
price, while some employee–shareholders received 
nothing. As a result, you may be dealing with 
disgruntled personnel right from the start.

Buyers typically do try to retain key employees. Yet it 
is rarely obvious from an acquirer’s perspective who 
the most critical personnel actually are. One common 
mistake is to confuse seniority with importance. 
Engineers, even junior ones, can be essential to 
making the acquired IP function smoothly. Conversely, 
some of the target’s executives, even very senior 
ones, may not matter for sustained success; they 
may be serial entrepreneurs or serial start-up  
chief experience officers (CXOs) who specialize in 
grooming VC-backed start-ups for acquisition  
but lack the desire or skill set to manage within large 
acquiring organizations. 

One industrial company did a retrospective study  
of 40 digital, analytic, and technology acquisitions 
stretching back over two decades. It found that 
there was no relationship between acquired CXO 
attrition and success or failure, and a very clear 
correlation between engineering attrition and failure. 
Strikingly, retaining the top one or two executives 
didn’t correlate (positively or negatively) with  
the success of acquisitions. But broadening the 
retention program did.

Paying attention to cultural fit improves retention as 
well. Morale issues can spring up unexpectedly, as 
they did when a large US-based software company 
acquired a small Canadian digital start-up, which 
was proud of its “beer Friday” in the office. That would 
have been unacceptable for the Fortune 100 
acquirer. Beer Friday, lamentably, went down the 
drain following the acquisition (at least in the  
office break room), but the effect on morale was 
relatively tame because this sophisticated acquirer 
had been proactively generous with retention 
bonuses for the engineering staff. Other successful 
acquirers have found ways to be flexible about more 
conventional traditions, such as free snacks.

Recognize sales-force sensibilities
Closely related to talent retention, but distinct in its 
own trip wires, is the need to minimize sales-force 
conflict. When acquired companies come with their 
own sales forces, these employees often encounter 
hurdles in their new environment. For one, they  
may no longer be allowed to reach out to customers 
directly, instead needing to go through a series  
of unfamiliar channels and gatekeepers. Sometimes 
there can be multiple relationships with a single 
buyer that need to be clarified, or the target’s 
salespeople may be expected to sell into unfamiliar 
industries. Each of these issues can quickly lead to 
frustration and attrition. 

Mapping two sales forces together is always a 
challenge. Often, a best practice is to convert  
the acquired sales force into an “overlay” function.  
This approach is ideal when the acquirer and 
acquired have a similar subset of customers, and the 
buyer also has a much larger set of customers, 
relationships, and salespeople. It’s also a best 
practice to overincentivize sales of the acquired 
product in the first one or two years. This way,  
the acquiring sales force, which may well have  
a lot of products to promote, won’t neglect  
the new addition. 

Often, the acquired company has no sales capability; 
the target is simply too early-stage. At one energy 
company we know, which acquired a small analytics 
provider, all of the target’s sales were CXO-led.  
The energy company planned to deploy its own sales 
force to sell the acquired technology to its existing 

82

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editioncustomer base, but the product was sophisticated 
and difficult for the acquirer’s sales team to grasp. 
Although its market-expanding potential was 
significant, it was a high-complexity, relatively low-
price technology when compared with the acquirer’s 
other offerings. As a result, the acquirer’s sales  
force ignored the lower-commission, more compli-
cated acquired product, and the acquisition missed 
its financial targets. Those missteps could have 
been averted by having a plan to train existing 
salespeople sooner, and establishing an incentive 
package to reward salespeople for selling the  
new product right from the start.

Keep up the integration momentum
Unfortunately, delays in integration are a common 
hazard in digital M&A and occur well beyond the 
sales force. The vast majority of large corporations’ 
digital acquisitions are small (less than $50 million  
in target revenues) relative to the buyer. As a result, 
acquired digital assets can wind up neglected, 
sitting adjacent to other products in an acquirer’s 
portfolio—out of sight and out of mind. That risks 
letting revenue synergies go untapped, or become 
stale after sitting too long. 

Let’s face it, integration is nitty-gritty work. 
Employees’ enthusiasm for integration into the 
mother ship may or may not be high to begin  
with, but it rarely gets higher over time. Moving 
quickly after an acquisition is a challenge in  
any sector, but, in digital—where technology evolves 
so rapidly—failing to do so can be ruinous. 
Sophisticated acquirers have an integration plan, 
head count, and budget in place before the 
acquisition is closed. High performers assign a full-

time integration leader from the parent company  
for at least one year, on-site if possible. Combining 
the acquired workers into one physical location  
with the parent isn’t always possible, but is advisable 
if it doesn’t involve making the whole staff  
relocate to a new city. It’s preferable not to leave  
the acquired company in a separate facility any 
longer than necessary. 

When times get tough, one of the easiest expenses 
to cut is acquisition-integration spending. Resist  
the temptation; a loss of momentum can doom an 
acquisition. This happened with one deal in the 
energy software space, when sales at the parent 
company suffered for macroeconomic reasons  
a few months following the acquisition. During the 
downturn, the operating budget to integrate the 
acquired company was pared. As a result, it missed 
its commercial targets, a problem that quickly 
turned into a negative spiral and eventually led to  
the write-off of the acquired business. 

Digital M&A is an engine of digital transformation, 
and sitting it out is an invitation to falling behind. 
Getting deals in the digital, analytics, and technology 
space right can turn, to a surprising degree, on 
limiting unforced errors at points where they can 
often go wrong. Sophisticated acquirers know 
where the missteps can happen. They cultivate 
digital M&A as a core competence. And while  
there is no foolproof, step-by-step road map for 
getting each deal right, every company should  
know where the common hazards may be, and 
control for what they can.

Improving the 
management of complex 
business partnerships

Adhering to four key principles can help companies increase the odds that 
their collaborations will create more value.

by Ruth De Backer and Eileen Kelly Rinaudo

Of course, the perennial problems associated with 
managing business partnerships don’t go away 
either—particularly as companies increasingly strike 
relationships with partners in different sectors  
and geographies. The last time we polled executives 
on their perceived risks for strategic partnerships,1 
the main ones were: partners’ disagreements on the 
central objectives for the relationship, poor 
communication practices among partners, poor 
governance processes, and, when market or  
other circumstances change, partners’ inability to 
identify and quickly make the changes needed  
for the relationship to succeed (exhibit).

Partnerships never go out of style. Companies 
regularly seek partners with complementary 
capabilities to gain access to new markets and 
channels, share intellectual property or infrastructure, 
or reduce risk. The more complex the business 
environ ment becomes—for instance, as new tech-
nologies emerge or as innovation cycles get  
faster—the more such relationships make sense. 
And the better companies get at managing 
individual relationships, the more likely it is that  
they will become “partners of choice” and able to 
build entire portfolios of practical and value-
creating partnerships.

In our work helping executive teams set up and 
navigate complex partnerships, we have witnessed 
firsthand how these problems crop up, and we  
have observed the different ways companies deal 
with them. The reality is: successful partnerships 
don’t just happen. Strong partners set a clear 
foundation for business relationships and nurture 
them. They emphasize accountability within and 
across partner companies, and they use metrics to 
gauge success. And they are willing to change 
things up if needed. Focusing on these priorities can 
help partnerships thrive and create more value  
than they would otherwise. 

1   Observations collected in McKinsey’s 2015 survey of more than 1,250 executives. Sixty-eight percent said they expect their organizations  

to increase the number of joint ventures or large partnerships they participate in over the next five years. A separate, follow-up survey in 2018 
showed that 73 percent of participants expect their companies to increase the number of large partnerships they engage in.

Establish a clear foundation 
It seems obvious that partner companies would 
strive to find common ground from the start—
particularly in the case of large joint ventures in 
which each side has a big financial stake, or in 
partnerships in which there are extreme differences 
in cultures, communications, and expectations. 

Yet, in a rush to complete the deal, discussions  
about common goals often get overlooked. This is 
especially true in strategic alliances within an 
industry, where everyone assumes that because 
they are operating in the same sector they are 
already on the same page. By skipping this step, 
companies increase the stress and tension placed 
on the partnership and reduce the odds of its 
success. For instance, the day-to-day operators end 
up receiving confusing guidance or conflicting 
priorities from partner organizations. 

How can the partners combat it? The individuals 
expected to lead day-to-day operations of the 
partnership, whether business unit executives or 
alliance managers, should be part of negotiations at 
the outset. This happens less often than you think 
because business-development teams and lawyers 
are typically charged with hammering out the  
terms of the deal—the objectives, scope, and 
governance structure—while the operations piece 
often gets sorted out after the fact. 

Transparency during negotiations is the only way to 
ensure that everyone understands the partners’ 
goals (whether their primary focus is on improving 
operations or launching a new strategy) and that 
everyone is using the same measures of success. 
Even more important, transparency encourages 
trust and collaboration among partners, which is 
especially important when you consider the number

of executives across the organizations who will  
likely rotate in and out of leadership roles during the 
life of the relationship.

Inevitably, points of tension will emerge. For instance, 
companies often disagree on financial flows or 
decision rights. But we have seen partners articulate 
such differences during the negotiation period,  
find agreement on priorities, and reset timelines and 
milestones. They defused much of the tension up 
front, so when new wrinkles—such as market shifts 
and changes in partners’ strategies—did emerge, 
the companies were more easily able to avoid costly 
setbacks and delays in the business activities  
they were pursuing together.

Nurture the relationship
Even business relationships that start off solidly  
can erode, given individual biases and common 
communication and collaboration issues. There are 
several measures partners can take to avoid  
these traps.

Connect socially 
If executives in the partner organizations actively 
look for opportunities to understand one another, 
good collaboration and communication at the 
operations level are likely to follow. Given time and 

geographic constraints, it can be hard for them to  
do so, but as one energy-sector executive who has 
negotiated and managed dozens of partnerships 
noted, “It’s important to spend as much time as you 
can on their turf.” He says about 30 to 40 percent  
of partnership meetings are about business; the rest 
of the time is spent building friendships and trust.

Keep everyone in the loop 
Skipping the step of keeping everyone informed can 
create unnecessary confusion and rework for 
partner organizations. That is what happened in  
the case of an industrial joint venture: the first 
partner in the joint venture included a key business-
unit leader in all venture-related discussions. The 
second partner apprised a key business unit leader 
about major developments, but this individual  
did not actually join the discussions until late in the 
joint-venture negotiation. At that point, as he 
learned more about the agreement, he flagged 
several issues, including inconsistencies in  
the partners’ access to vendors and related data.  
He immediately recognized these issues  
because they directly affected operations in his 
division. Because he hadn’t been included in  
early discussions, however, the partners wasted 
time designing an operating model for the joint 
venture that would likely not work for one of them. 
They had to go back to the drawing board.

If executives in the partner 
organizations actively look for 
opportunities to understand  
one another, good collaboration and 
communication at the operations  
level are likely to follow.

86

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionRecognize each other’s capabilities, cultures, 
and motivations 
Partners come together to take advantage of 
complementary geographies, corresponding sales 
and marketing strengths, or compatibilities in  
other functional areas. But it is important to under-
stand which partner is best at what. This process 
must start before the deal is completed—but cannot 
stop at signing. In the case of one consumer- 
goods joint venture, for instance, the two partner 
organizations felt confident in their plan to  
combine the manufacturing strength of one 
company with the sales and marketing strengths  
of the other. During their discussions on how  
to handle financial reporting, however, it became  
clear that the partner with sales and marketing 
strengths had a spike in forecasting, budgeting,  
and reporting expertise. The product team for the 
first partner had originally expected to manage 
these finance tasks, but both partner teams 
ultimately agreed that the second partner should  
take them on. In this way, they were able to  
enhance the joint venture’s ongoing operations  
and ensure its viability. 

Equally important is understanding each partner’s 
motivation behind the deal. This is a common  
point of focus during early negotiations; it should 
continue to be discussed as part of day-to-day 
operations—particularly if there are secondary 
motivators, such as access to suppliers or transfer of 
capabilities, that are important to each partner. 
Within one energy-sector partnership, for instance, 
the nonoperating partner was keen to understand 
how its local workforce would receive training over 
the course of the partnership. This company wanted 
to enhance the skills of the local workforce to  
create more opportunities for long-term employment 
in the region. The operating partner incorporated 
training and skill-evaluation metrics in the venture’s 
quarterly updates, thus improving the companies’ 
communi cation on the topic and explicitly 
acknowledging the importance of this point to  
its partner. 

Invest in tools, processes, and personnel 
Bringing different business cultures together can be 
challenging, given partners’ varying communication 
styles and expectations. The good news is that there 

are a range of tools—among them, financial models, 
key performance indicators, playbooks, and portfolio 
reviews—companies can use to help bridge any 
gaps. And not all these interventions are technology 
dependent. Some companies simply standardize  
the format of partnership meetings and agendas so 
that teams know what to expect. Others follow 
stringent reporting requirements.

Another good move is to convene an alliance 
management team. This group tracks and reviews 
the partnership’s progress against defined metrics 
and helps to spot potential areas of concern— 
ideally with enough time to change course. Such 
teams take different forms. One pharmaceutical 
company with dozens of commercial and research 
partnerships has a nine-member alliance 
management team charged mostly with monitoring 
and flagging potential issues for business unit 
leaders, so it consists of primarily junior members 
and one senior leader who interacts directly with 
partners. An energy company with four large-scale 
joint ventures has taken a different approach: its 
alliance management team comprises four people, 
but each is an experienced business leader who  
can serve as a resource for the respective joint-
venture-leadership teams. 

How companies structure these teams depends  
on concrete factors—the number and complexity  
of the partnerships, for instance—as well as 
intangibles like executive support for alliances  
and joint ventures and the experiences and 
capabilities of the individuals who would make up 
the alliance management team. 

Emphasize accountability and metrics
Good governance is the linchpin for successful 
partnerships; as such, it is critical that senior 
executives from the partner organizations remain 
involved in oversight of the partnership. At the  
very least, each partner should assign a senior line 
executive from the company to be “deal sponsor”—
someone who can keep operations leaders and 
alliance managers focused on priorities, advocate 
for resources when needed, and generally  
create an environment in which everyone can act 
with more confidence and coordination.

Sometimes partnerships need a 
structural shake-up—and not just as
an act of last resort.

Additionally, the partners must define “success” for 
their operations teams: What metrics will they  
use to determine whether they have hit their goals, 
and how will they track them? Some companies  
have built responsibility matrices; others have used 
detailed process maps or project stage gates to 
clarify expectations, timelines, and critical 
performance measures. When partnerships are 
initially formed, it is usually the business 
development teams that are responsible for building 
the case for the deal and identifying the value  
that may be created for both sides. As the partner-
ship evolves, the operations teams must take  
over this task, but they will need ongoing guidance 
from senior leaders in the partner organizations. 

Build a dynamic partnership
Sometimes partnerships need a structural  
shake-up—and not just as an act of last resort. For 
instance, it might be less critical to revisit the 
structure of a partnership in which both sides are 
focused on the joint commercialization of 
complementary products than it would be for a 
partnership focused on the joint develop   ment  
of a set of new technologies. But there are some 
basic rules of thumb for considering changes  
in partnership structure. 

Partner organizations must acknowledge that the 
scope of the relationship is likely to shift over  
time. This will be the case whether the partners are 
in a single- or multiasset venture, expect that 
services will be shared, anticipate expansion, or 
have any geographic, regulatory, or structural 
complexities. Accepting the inevitable will 
encourage partners to plan more carefully at the 

outset. For example, during negotiations, the 
partners in a pharmaceutical partnership determined 
that they had different views on future demand for 
drugs in development. This wasn’t a deal breaker, 
however. Instead, the partners designated a formula 
by which financial flows would be evaluated at 
specific intervals to address any changes in 
expected performance. This allowed the partners  
to adjust the partnership based on changes in 
market demand or the emergence of new products. 
All changes could be incorporated fairly into the 
financial splits of the partnership. 

Partners should also consider the potential  
for restructuring during the negotiation process—
ideally framing the potential endgame for the 
relationship. What market shifts might occur, how 
might that affect both sides’ interests and incentives, 
and what mechanisms would allow for orderly 
restructuring? When one oil and gas joint venture 
began struggling, the joint-venture leader realized he 
was being pulled in opposing directions by the  
two partner companies because of the companies’ 
conflicting incentives. “It made the alliance 
completely unstable,” he told us. He brought the 
partners back to the negotiation table to determine 
how to reconcile these conflicting incentives, 
restructure their agreement, and continue the 
relationship, thus avoiding deep resent  ment and 
frustration on both sides of the deal. 

Such dialogues about the partnership’s future,  
while potentially stressful, should be conducted 
regularly—at least annually. 

88

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionAn emphasis on clarity, proactive management, 
accountability, and agility can not only extend the 
life span of a partnership or joint venture but can 
also help companies build the capability to establish 
more of them—and, in the process, create outsize 
value and productivity in their organizations.

The implementation of these four principles requires 
some forethought and care. Every relationship 
comes with its own idiosyncrasies, after all, depend-
ing on industry, geography, previous experience,  
and strategy. Managing relationships outside of 
developed markets, for instance, can present 
additional challenges involving local cultures, inte-
gration norms, and regulatory complexities.  
Even in these emerging-market deals, however, the 
principles can serve as effective prerequisites  
for initiating discussions about how to change long-
standing practices and mind-sets.

costs and complexity. Some operational and other 
synergies may materialize—but eventually 
executives and boards realize how difficult it is to 
add value to businesses that have little or no direct 
connection to the company’s core business.2

The realization may come when a business unit’s 
performance is lagging behind that of its peers with 
no clear path to catch up. Or a review of the 
company’s portfolio may reveal that some business 
units’ cost structures are not comparable with those 
of its peers. Or executives may recognize that the 
company lacks sufficient management capabilities 
to grow all the businesses in its portfolio. 

Breakups aren’t just fodder for celebrity gossip 
websites. Separations are back in the business pages, 
as large conglomerates in healthcare, consumer 
electronics, logistics, and other sectors announce 
their intentions to spin off business units or  
explore avenues for doing so.1

Despite all the new ink being spilled on this trend, in 
many ways it’s just another chapter in the long-
running story about diversification strategies: a 
company matures, prompting executives to  
look outside the core business for ways to grow. (A 
logistics company acquires a software company.  
A pharmaceutical company enters the consumer-
health market.) As revenues increase, so do  

When these signals appear, companies acknowledge 
that they are no longer the best owner of an asset, 
and spin-offs ensue—especially in an environment 
like the one we’re experiencing now, when business 
models are being tested by a crisis and new 
strategies are needed, market valuations are high, 
and financial engineers are hard at work (exhibit).

There are fundamental reasons why we’re seeing 
more large companies pursuing spin-offs—
specifically, because such deals can help to improve 
the operating model, management focus and 
strategy, and capital management for both the parent 
company and the divested business unit.

Operating model
A group structure often imposes operating 
requirements on all the business units in a company’s 
portfolio. A pharmaceutical and medical-device 
conglomerate, for instance, may require all business 
units to use a centralized compliance and regulatory 
process or common inventory management and 
sales-reporting systems. But different drug and 
device divisions have different needs, so the teams 
managing these common compliance, procurement, 
and sales functions would likely struggle to cater  
to each unit’s unique circumstances and priorities. 
Indeed, when companies’ portfolios mix high-
margin, high-growth businesses with lower-margin, 
mature businesses, there can be a clear operating-
model mismatch.3

A breakup would allow for a more tailored operating 
model. Consider the case of a global consumer 
company that owned both a high-margin branded 
business along with a lower-margin, nonbranded-
commodity business: there were clear synergies in 
distribution and supply chain processes. But  
razor-thin margins in the highly competitive 
consumer-packaged-goods industry meant that the 
nonbranded-commodity business required a much 
leaner cost structure and a more focused operating 
model than the consumer company had. By selling 
off the nonbranded-commodity business to a better 
owner, the global consumer company was able to 
streamline its operating model and pursue growth in 
its branded business.

Management focus and strategy
Experience shows that senior leaders in 
conglomerates tend to overinvest attention and 
organizational resources in high-growth parts  
of their business and underinvest in lower-growth  
or more mature parts of the organization.4 The 
opposite can happen, too. Senior leaders may be 
overly focused on the success or failure of the 
biggest business unit and less so on overall growth. 
The result is often uneven development of 
businesses within the portfolio. Mature organizations 
fall further and further behind peers and struggle  
to find the resources to maintain or recapture their 
leadership positions, even when they represent 
most of the company’s total revenues. Even if 
manage ment is appropriately tending to all parts of 
the business, analysts and investors with limited 
time to evaluate companies may struggle to under-
stand what’s driving growth in disparate parts of  
a diversified business. 

At one technology services provider that also owned 
and developed its own software, senior manage-
ment struggled with resource-allocation decisions 
and at times missed out on some of the biggest 
trends in the industry—particularly in moving the 
provider’s software to a cloud infrastructure. It  

was only after divesting its services business that 
the company was able to position itself as a player  
in the market for software as a service. 

Capital management
A group structure can also make it more difficult for 
executives to determine how to balance investments 
in high-risk, high-reward opportunities (or, as they 
are known in most companies, “the most exciting 
initiatives”) versus low-risk, low-reward ones. More-
over, some executives are reluctant to raise capital 
for discrete business units—in the case of an 
acquisition, for instance—when they feel like their 
share price doesn’t fairly reflect the full value of  
the organization. 

Divesting noncore business units can help address 
these concerns.5 For instance, if a technology 
company spins out a legacy infrastructure business  
unit as a pure-play stand-alone company, it may  
be easier for the infrastructure business to raise  
capital for an acquisition and pursue market 
consolidation—without having to compete for 
funding with all the other businesses within  
the technology company. 

By selling off the nonbranded-
commodity business to a better 
owner, the global consumer 
company was able to streamline its 
operating model and pursue growth 
in its branded business.

92

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionIt’s true that some technology companies are, so far, 
still following a bigger-is-better approach. But for 
most others, the days of the diversified conglomerate 
are receding. 

Our own research and experience suggest two 
things: first, the best-performing conglomerates  
do well not because they are diversified but  
because they are truly the best owners of the 
businesses within their portfolio. And second, for 
conglomerates that acknowledge their flaws  
and that are seeking improvements in the three 
areas cited earlier (operations, management  
focus, and capital), breaking up doesn’t need to be 
so hard to do—as long as executives systematically 
consider the growth strategies, operations,  
talent, and cultural changes the parent company 
and divested business unit will require for  
a win–win scenario.6

Executives frequently comment that a “sum of all 
parts” valuation, versus applying peer multiples  
to each business in a portfolio, doesn’t fairly reflect 
the full value of their business. That is because 
individual business units tend to perform less well 
than pure-play companies. In the case of the 
technology company, then, the separation of the 
legacy infrastructure business would eliminate  
this noise and, theoretically, would ensure that each 
business within the technology company’s portfolio 
is valued at a fair multiple.

In perfectly rational capital markets, the value  
from a spin-off would come primarily from  
the operating-model efficiencies it enables and the 
management attention that it frees up. Capital 
markets aren’t completely rational, though, and  
as we noted, many businesses struggle with 
allocation decisions. Additionally, there is at least a 
perceived multiples discount on companies with 
diverse business lines, perhaps because investors 
would prefer to make their own diversification 
decisions rather than rely on management. As a 
result, companies pursuing spin-offs often  
include all three sources of value creation when 
announcing their plans.

Profitably parting ways:  
Getting more value from 
divestitures

Companies often struggle to capture the full value of a separation.  
Here’s how to do better.

by David Fubini, Michael Park, and Kim Thomas

But once a company decides to sell, problems can 
arise. Managers devote their attention to finding a 
buyer but seldom scope deals from a potential 
buyer’s point of view, even as they struggle to figure 
out exactly what should be included in the sale, 
apart from the productive assets that are its 
centerpiece. They often think about the separation 
process only secondarily, assuming they can 
separate a business and worry about stranded costs 
later. And they neglect the reality of internal 
competition for resources that can flare up between 
the managers who are staying and those who are 
leaving. Manage ment and the board can get so 
caught up in the sale that the core business begins 
to suffer from neglect. All in all, divestiture turns  
out to be no panacea: sellers can take up to three 
years to recover from the experience. Indeed,  
some companies are so wary of these pitfalls that 
they decide to muddle through with businesses  
of which they are not the natural owners—another 
unsatisfactory result, as research suggests that 
these sales can produce significant returns for  
both the parent company and the divested or spun-
off business.2

Most divestitures start with a strategic decision 
that a company is no longer the best owner of one of 
its businesses. It’s a natural move for executives  
who see value in actively managing their portfolio of 
business units—recognizing that to grow, they 
sometimes have to shrink first—to deploy capital into 
a business with higher returns, for example, or  
to reshape the company’s strategy. Indeed, past 
McKinsey research has shown that companies  
that more frequently reallocate capital generate 
higher returns than their peers.1

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Edition 
 
In our experience, even highly complex divestitures 
can work well, provided companies follow proven 
practices, especially in three areas: scoping the deal 
in detail, addressing the so-called stranded costs 
left behind when the revenue-generating assets are 
sold, and managing the expectations and concerns 
of employees. 

These are not discrete goals—in fact, they are 
mutually reinforcing. Setting clear boundaries for 
the deal will enable managers to understand the 
implications of any subsequent adjustments to the 
scope and accordingly help them maximize value. 
Clear boundaries will also help the seller understand 
the costs that are likely to be stranded; knowing 
these early is essential, as they often require some 
time to wind down. And the process of defining the 
deal’s potential boundaries lets companies be more 
transparent with employees about the deal process, 
its progress, and where they’re likely to end up. 
Getting started on these activities quickly, in parallel 
with the search for a buyer, can unlock enormous 
value for buyer and seller alike.

Taking the buyer’s point of view
Few companies adequately study the likely 
boundaries of a deal before they start searching for 
buyers, preferring to start with a simple high-level 

definition rather than dig into the details. Admittedly, 
it’s a bit impractical to define exact deal boundaries 
before the identity of the buyer and its preferences 
are known. 

To get around that problem, smart sellers define a 
number of different deal packages—of assets, 
people, and services—configured to attract interest 
from a broad spectrum of buyers. These packages 
not only broaden the field of potential buyers, often 
in ways that companies cannot envision at the 
outset, but also help the company cope with the 
tough questions that buyers inevitably have about 
what’s in scope, how to separate, the transitional 
services they can count on, and the financials of the 
business. Sellers that haven’t begun to define  
the deal will be unable to provide good answers—
delaying the sales process and losing their 
competitive position, as well as leaving buyers to 
factor more risk into their valuation models and 
lowering the value they see in the deal. 

When one European private-equity firm, for example, 
didn’t get all the answers it sought about a company 
it was negotiating to acquire, it raised the level of 
assumed risk in its valuation model, suppressing the 
value of the deal and lowering the price it was willing 
to pay. To prevent such problems, a US industrial 
company divesting a subsidiary conducted a 

Smart sellers define a number of 
different deal packages that not only 
broaden the field of potential buyers  
but also help the company cope with  
the tough questions that buyers 
inevitably have.

detailed analysis of its true sales, general, and 
administrative costs and, by clearly defining which 
activities were attributable to the business being 
sold, found them to be tens of millions of dollars lower 
than current allocations. That exercise provided 
detailed informa tion for potential buyers, increased 
the profit of the business being sold, and helped  
get a higher price for the deal. 

Sellers can construct sale packages for a range  
of buyers. Each buyer is unique and will have more or 
less need for infrastructure, capabilities, and a 
geographic presence where the assets for sale are 
located. To prepare for the wide range of needs, 
most sellers will want to develop basic packages for 
at least three types of bidder: a strategic buyer  
with a local presence, a strategic buyer from another 
region, and a private-equity firm seeking a stand-
alone entity. Bundles for strategic buyers with  
no local infrastructure and for private-equity buyers 
typically include more support services than those 
designed for local strategic investors, which may 
only want the operational and market-facing parts of 
the business. 

These packages represent two ends of the spectrum; 
in between, there are many possible configurations 
of support services to package with the assets. And 
there may also be buyers interested in cherry-picking 
parts of the core business instead of taking all  
of it—which, while probably not ideal, should not be 
discounted out of hand. Sale packages include  
pro forma financial statements tailored to represent  
the package being offered to each buyer or class  
of buyer that highlight the true value of the business, 
separation and transition plans, and details on 
proposed management and talent assignments.

When a large industrial company was looking to 
divest one of its business units in the late 2000s, its 
managers’ first instinct was to sell to a large strategic 
buyer. But by conducting a form of due diligence  
on its prospective buyers (often known as a “reverse 
due diligence”)—including some private-equity 
firms—the company was able to understand all the 
potential synergies each would gain by buying  
the business. That enabled managers to design a 

specific value proposition for each potential buyer. 
Eventually, they were able to attract—and sell the 
business to—a much smaller player that hadn’t even 
come up in their initial scan for potential buyers. 
Even better, the company got a price 20 percent 
higher than first expected. In fact, all the bids 
exceeded expectations; the final list of bidders 
included a private-equity consortium and a few other 
unanticipated interests.

Rooting out stranded costs
One of the most challenging aspects of a major 
divestiture is that even sellers that control expenses 
well are inevitably left with some corporate costs 
associated with the business but not sold with it. 
Without the revenues to support them, these 
stranded costs are a direct threat to the bottom line. 
Stranded costs essentially can be any type of  
cost that does not automatically disappear with the 
transaction, from costs related to shared services, 
such as marketing and investor relations, to IT 
infrastructure. Some of these are fixed, such as the 
IT system, and cannot be readily reduced regardless 
of the size of the divestiture. Others are more 
variable and can contract, for example, with a lower 
head count—but they can still take years to unwind 
unless explicitly planned as part of the divestiture. 
As noted, sellers often take up to three years to 
recover from a divestiture.

Sellers whose cost management is weak are all  
the more challenged by stranded costs and are 
often surprised by how much overhead they have. 
The divestiture typically reveals unsuspected  
layers of complexity or outright duplication within 
centralized functions.

We see three strong practices to reduce overhead. 
First, as we have discussed, defining the precise 
boundaries of potential deal packages early in the 
deal brings to light the full extent of the subsidiary’s 
sales, general, and administrative costs. The  
parent company can make a better attribution of 
resources to the parent and the subsidiary. That 
benefits both companies. 

96

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionRooting out stranded costs takes a 
separation manager with the foresight  
to rethink the parent company’s
cost base and the authority to make it
happen—the third good practice.

Second, successful sellers often use the momentum 
generated by the divestiture as a catalyst to reduce 
stranded costs—and to improve the performance of 
any bloated or inefficient corporate-center  
activities revealed by the divestiture. (This mirrors  
a similar effect of transformational acquisitions,  
in which buyers take advantage of the circumstances 
of an acquisition as a catalyst to restructure costs 
more broadly.3) Companies can seize the impetus of 
the divestiture to reexamine their entire cost  
base using benchmarking analysis to highlight 
potential inefficiency or even zero-based  
budgeting to encourage a radical rethinking of  
the corporate infrastructure. 

Rooting out stranded costs takes a separation 
manager with the foresight to rethink the parent 
company’s cost base and the authority to make it 
happen—the third good practice. 

One industrial organization had divested a few units 
over the years, but it had not followed suit with its 
corporate functions, which were still sized for their 
earlier duties. When it came time to shape another 
big divestiture, representing about 10 percent  
of revenues, the company conducted a thorough 
search for the stranded costs that lay within 
individual support functions, as well as costs that  
cut across functions such as real estate. All told, 
these added up to hundreds of millions of dollars. 

That proved to be a catalyst for an even broader  
cost restructuring. 

Companies of this size often face a special problem 
in rooting out stranded costs. For many large multi-
national companies organized by matrix, the only 
pragmatic method is for senior management to lead 
a cross-functional initiative to tackle crosscutting 
opportunities such as shared-service and out-
sourcing operations, as well as the change programs 
required to support the cost transformations.

Managing employee expectations
The challenges of talent management in a 
divestiture start at the moment companies begin 
defining the boundaries of different sale packages 
and continue right through to the close of the  
deal. First and foremost, managers struggle to figure 
out what to say to the people involved. Most choose  
to say nothing at first, reflecting the genuine 
uncertainty about what will happen. Sometimes 
company leaders will choose to keep plans for  
the deal confidential up until signing—as one global 
CEO and seasoned divestiture veteran told us,  
“I just deny everything until the deal is signed. It’s 
easier that way.” This may be true, but it creates a 
communi cation challenge. Many employees inevitably 
will know about the deal because of the massive 
prepa ra tion work that is impossible to conceal. But if

It is important to define and implement 
a set of performance measures and 
rewards aligned with value maximization, 
and to use these with all key people 
involved in the divestiture process.

management officially denies the reports, it 
becomes very difficult to put in place communication 
plans and other measures to minimize the concerns 
that always arise in such situations—all employees 
want to know, “What happens to me?” 

Some form of short announcement is essential. Once 
managers make an announcement, they should 
clearly define and communicate the selection process 
to keep employees motivated while they wait for 
news of their fate. That can, of course, be challenging 
in situations where the deal boundaries are unclear 
until late in the process. Ideally, the communication 
plan should be part of a compelling story that  
shows not only employees but also investors, 
analysts, and customers why the divestiture will 
leave both buyer and seller better off. 

Once the word is out, other challenges begin. In 
almost every divestiture we’ve worked on, tension 
has arisen from the moment it becomes clear  
who is staying and who is going. Given the role the 
exiting managers will play in communicating  
the business’s value to potential buyers, delay in 
informing them is undesirable. But once they  
are informed, they immediately become another 
party at the negotiating table, bargaining for  
the talent, assets, and contracts they feel they’ll 
need to be successful and trying to avoid the  
ones they don’t want. 

Failing to manage the tension between the two 
groups can be damaging. When a global industrial 
company divested a multibillion-dollar division,  

for example, it began to receive a lot of applications 
for transfers from the entity to be divested back  
into the parent company—so many, indeed, that the 
company was at risk of visibly depleting the divested 
company of talent and experienced leadership, 
potentially affecting its value. To discourage the 
transfers, it aligned the incentives of people in  
the departing unit to the characteristics of the 
sale. It decided to reward managers based on 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortization (EBITDA)—a critical negotiating  
point with the private-equity firm that ultimately 
bought it. The emphasis on EBITDA motivated 
exiting managers to minimize the overhead they took 
with them; it also reduced transfer requests. 

This approach did leave more overhead for parent-
company managers to deal with, just as they too 
were striving to reduce overhead costs. But they 
made a conscious choice to accept this, believing that 
the right way to deal with broader cost issues  
was, as we discussed above, as part of a thorough 
change process in the wake of the divestiture. 

Parent-company managers often lack the incentives 
that would compel them to take care of the departing 
entity. If they do not feel responsible for the unit’s 
success, they may stop investing in value-creating 
projects, caring for employees and customers, or 
watching costs. In our experience, it is important to 
define and implement a set of performance 
measures and rewards aligned with value maximi-
zation, and to use these with all key people involved 
in the divestiture process. The most obvious  

98

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionrewards are monetary, but research shows that 
other incentives (such as recognition and 
promotions) can be equally if not more important 
determinants of performance.

Negotiations over talent are particularly sensitive. 
The first inclination of parent-company managers is 
to keep the best performers and send the rest  
with the divested business. That’s not practical, in 
the end, because regardless of the type of buyer,  
the divestor has a moral obligation—and in some 
places a legal one—to make sure the business  
is a going concern. Furthermore, sellers who intend 
to divest multiple businesses in the future do not 
want to be perceived by the market as selling bad 
businesses stripped of key talent, as this will of 
course affect their ability to make future deals. At 
the same time, the parent company must retain 

critical resources, and quite often, the exiting 
managers have the very skills they need. Thus, 
successful divestors will address the issue  
of talent early in the process and start building or 
acquiring the skills needed in both the parent 
organization and the business to be sold. 

Much of the value of a divestiture depends on  
the effectiveness of the separation process. 
Defining the right deal, managing talent uncertainty, 
and rooting out stranded costs can make the 
difference between a deal that succeeds and one 
that destroys value. And skill in divestiture is 
comparatively rare; doing it well can help companies 
get a competitive edge.

ESG Do environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 

priorities compete with long-term value creation? 

While some companies may be tempted to cut 
back on ESG initiatives in order to boost short-
term earnings (just as with any other investment), 
managing exclusively for short-term earnings  
is antithetical to long-term value creation. For 
companies to earn and to continue to merit their 
social license—and, in turn, deliver value for their 
investors—they must meet the needs of a wide 
range of stakeholders; recognize environmental, 
social, and governance expec tations; and 
understand how those expectations can shift.  
No organization can remain in business unless  
it follows law and ethical custom.

Today, the existential dangers of climate change 
and the need to reach net-zero emissions are 
clearly top of mind. But as we have shown for 
decades, forward-thinking companies have  
been addressing first-, second-, and third-order 
consequences of climate change, including 
existing or potential regulation, in a thoughtful, 
value-creating way. 

This deliberative approach holds true as companies 
consider each of the ESG dimensions. When 
calibrated to the unique requirements of a distinct 
business model, ESG does not compete with long-
term value creation. Rather, ESG can help unlock 
value, with positive effects for stakeholders, 
society, and the planet.

Five ways that ESG  
creates value

Getting your environmental, social, and governance (ESG) proposition right 
links to higher value creation. Here’s why.

by Witold Henisz, Tim Koller, and Robin Nuttall

with people and institutions in the communities 
where you do business. S includes labor relations 
and diversity and inclusion. Every company 
operates within a broader, diverse society.

 — G, governance, is the internal system of practices, 
controls, and procedures your company adopts 
in order to govern itself, make effective decisions, 
comply with the law, and meet the needs of 
external stakeholders. Every company, which is 
itself a legal creation, requires governance.

Just as ESG is an inextricable part of how you  
do business, its individual elements are themselves 
intertwined. For example, social criteria overlaps 
with environmental criteria and governance when 
companies seek to comply with environmental  
laws and broader concerns about sustainability. Our 
focus is mostly on environmental and social criteria, 
but, as every leader knows, governance can  
never be hermetically separate. Indeed, excelling  
in governance calls for mastering not just the  
letter of laws but also their spirit—such as getting in 
front of violations before they occur, or ensuring 
transparency and dialogue with regulators instead  
of formalistically submitting a report and letting  
the results speak for themselves.

Thinking and acting on ESG in a proactive way has 
lately become even more pressing. The US Business 
Roundtable released a statement in August 2019 
strongly affirming business’s commitment to a broad 
range of stakeholders, including customers,

Your business, like every business, is deeply inter-
twined with environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) concerns. It makes sense, therefore, that  
a strong ESG proposition can create value—and in 
this article, we provide a framework for under-
standing the five key ways it can do so. But first, let’s 
briefly consider the individual elements of ESG:

 — The E in ESG, environmental criteria, includes the 
energy your company takes in and the waste it 
discharges, the resources it needs, and the 
consequences for living beings as a result. Not 
least, E encompasses carbon emissions and 
climate change. Every company uses energy and 
resources; every company affects, and is 
affected by, the environment.

 — S, social criteria, addresses the relationships 

your company has and the reputation it fosters 

102

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Edition 
 
employees, suppliers, communities, and, of course, 
shareholders.1 Of a piece with that emerging zeitgeist, 
ESG-oriented investing has experienced a meteoric 
rise. Global sustainable investment now tops  
$30 trillion—up 68 percent since 2014 and tenfold 
since 2004.2 The acceleration has been driven  
by heightened social, governmental, and consumer 
attention on the broader impact of corporations,  
as well as by the investors and executives who 
realize that a strong ESG proposition can safeguard  
a company’s long-term success. The magnitude  
of investment flow suggests that ESG is much more 
than a fad or a feel-good exercise.

So does the level of business performance. The 
overwhelming weight of accumulated research  
finds that companies that pay attention to 
environmental, social, and governance concerns  
do not experience a drag on value creation— 
in fact, they experience quite the opposite (Exhibit 1). 
A strong ESG proposition correlates with higher 
equity returns, from both a tilt and a momentum 
perspec tive.3 Better performance in ESG also 
corresponds with a reduction in downside risk, as 
evidenced, among other ways, by lower loan  
and credit default swap spreads and higher  
credit ratings.4

Five ways that ESG creates value But even as the case for a strong ESG proposition 
becomes more compelling, an understanding of why 
these criteria link to value creation is less compre-
hensive. How exactly does a strong ESG proposition 
make financial sense? From our experience and 
research, ESG links to cash flow in five important 
ways: (1) facilitating top-line growth, (2) reducing 
costs, (3) minimizing regulatory and legal interven-
tions, (4) increasing employee productivity, and  
(5) optimizing investment and capital expenditures 
(Exhibit 2). Each of these five levers should be  
part of a leader’s mental checklist when approaching 
ESG opportunities—and so should be an under-
stand ing of the “softer,” more personal dynamics 
needed for the levers to accomplish their  
heaviest lifting.

Five links to value creation
The five links are a way to think of ESG systematically, 
not an assurance that each link will apply, or apply to 
the same degree, in every instance. Some are more 
likely to arise in certain industries or sectors; others 
will be more frequent in given geographies. Still, all 
five should be considered regardless of a company’s 
business model or location. The potential for value 
creation is too great to leave any of them unexplored.

1. Top-line growth
A strong ESG proposition helps companies tap new 
markets and expand into existing ones. When 
governing authorities trust corporate actors, they 
are more likely to award them the access, approvals, 
and licenses that afford fresh opportunities for

private infrastructure project in Long Beach, 
California, the for-profit companies selected to 
participate were screened based on their prior 
performance in sustainability. Superior ESG execu-
tion has demonstrably paid off in mining as well. 
Consider gold, a commodity (albeit an expensive 
one) that should, all else being equal, generate  
the same rents for the companies that mine it regard-
less of their ESG propositions. Yet one major study 
found that companies with social-engagement 
activities that were perceived to be beneficial by 
public and social stakeholders had an easier go  
at extracting those resources without extensive 
planning or operational delays. These companies 
achieved demonstrably higher valuations than 
competitors with lower social capital.5

2. Cost reductions
ESG can also reduce costs substantially. Among 
other advantages, executing ESG effectively  
can help combat rising operating expenses (such as 
raw-material costs and the true cost of water or 
carbon), which McKinsey research has found can 
affect operating profits by as much as 60 percent.  
In the same report, our colleagues created a  
metric (the amount of energy, water, and waste used 
in relation to revenue) to analyze the relative 
resource efficiency of companies within various 
sectors and found a significant correlation  
between resource efficiency and financial 
performance. The study also identified a number  
of companies across sectors that did particularly 
well—precisely the companies that had taken their 
sustainability strategies the furthest.

ESG can also drive consumer preference. McKinsey 
research has shown that customers say they are 
willing to pay to “go green.” Although there can be 
wide discrepancies in practice, including customers 
who refuse to pay even 1 percent more, we’ve  
found that upward of 70 percent of consumers 
surveyed on purchases in multiple industries, 
including the automotive, building, electronics, and 
packaging categories, said they would pay an 
additional 5 percent for a green product if it met  
the same performance standards as a nongreen 
alternative. In another study, nearly half (44 percent) 
of the companies we surveyed identified business 
and growth opportunities as the impetus for starting 
their sustainability programs.

The payoffs are real. When Unilever developed 
Sunlight, a brand of dishwashing liquid that used 
much less water than its other brands, sales of 
Sunlight and Unilever’s other water-saving products 
proceeded to outpace category growth by more 
than 20 percent in a number of water-scarce markets. 
And Finland’s Neste, founded as a traditional 
petroleum-refining company more than 70 years 
ago, now generates more than two-thirds of  
its profits from renewable fuels and sustainability-
related products.

As with each of the five links to ESG value creation, 
the first step to realizing value begins with recognizing 
the opportunity. Consider 3M, which has long 
understood that being proactive about environmental 
risk can be a source of competitive advantage.  
The company has saved $2.2 billion since introducing 
its “pollution prevention pays” (3Ps) program in  
1975, preventing pollution up front by reformulating 
products, improving manufacturing processes, 
redesigning equipment, and recycling and reusing 
waste from production. Another enterprise, a  
major water utility company, achieved cost savings 
of almost $180 million per year thanks to lean 
initiatives aimed at improving preventive maintenance, 
refining spare-part inventory management, and 
tackling energy consumption and recovery from 
sludge. FedEx, for its part, aims to convert its 
entire 35,000-vehicle fleet to electric or hybrid 
engines; to date, 20 percent have been converted, 
which has already reduced fuel consumption by 
more than 50 million gallons.6

3. Reduced regulatory and legal interventions
A stronger external-value proposition can enable 
companies to achieve greater strategic freedom, 
easing regulatory pressure. In fact, in case after case 
across sectors and geographies, we’ve seen that

sectors, where government subsidies (among  
other forms of intervention) are prevalent, the value 
at stake can reach 60 percent as well (Exhibit 3).

The value at stake may be higher than you think. By 
our analysis, typically one-third of corporate profits 
are at risk from state intervention. Regulation’s 
impact, of course, varies by industry. For pharma-
ceuticals and healthcare, the profits at stake are 
about 25 to 30 percent. In banking, where provisions 
on capital requirements, “too big to fail,” and 
consumer protection are so critical, the value at 
stake is typically 50 to 60 percent. For the

4. Employee productivity uplift
A strong ESG proposition can help companies attract 
and retain quality employees, enhance employee 
motivation by instilling a sense of purpose, and 
increase productivity overall. Employee satisfaction 
is positively correlated with shareholder returns.7

Edmans found that the companies that made 
Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list

observed that employees with a sense not just of

The stronger an employee’s perception of impact on 
the beneficiaries of their work, the greater the 
employee’s motivation to act in a “prosocial” way.9

Recent studies have also shown that positive social 
impact correlates with higher job satisfaction, and 
field experiments suggest that when companies 
“give back,” employees react with enthusiasm. For

walls, across the supply chain. Primary suppliers 
often subcontract portions of large orders to other 
firms or rely on purchasing agents, and subcon-
tractors are typically managed loosely, sometimes 
with little oversight of workers’ health and safety.

Farsighted companies pay heed. Consider General 
Mills, which works to ensure that its ESG principles 
apply “from farm to fork to landfill.” Walmart tracks 
the work conditions of its suppliers, including those 
with extensive factory floors in China, according to  
a proprietary company scorecard. And Mars seeks 
opportunities where it can deliver what it calls “wins-
wins-wins” for the company, its suppliers, and the 
environment. Mars has developed model farms that 
not only introduce new techno logical initiatives to 
farmers in its supply chains, but also increase farmers’ 
access to capital so that they are able to obtain a 
financial stake in those initiatives.11

Just as a sense of higher purpose can inspire your 
employees to perform better, a weaker ESG 
proposition can drag productivity down. The most 
glaring examples are strikes, worker slowdowns, and 
other labor actions within your organization. But  
it’s worth remembering that productivity constraints 
can also manifest outside of your company’s four 

5. Investment and asset optimization
A strong ESG proposition can enhance investment 
returns by allocating capital to more promising  
and more sustainable opportunities (for example,

Five ways that ESG creates value that may not pay off because of longer-term 
environmental issues (such as massive write-downs 
in the value of oil tankers). Remember, taking proper 
account of investment returns requires that you  
start from the proper baseline. When it comes to 
ESG, it’s important to bear in mind that a do-nothing 
approach is usually an eroding line, not a straight 
line. Continuing to rely on energy-hungry plants and 
equipment, for example, can drain cash going 
forward. While the investments required to update 
your operations may be substantial, choosing to  
wait it out can be the most expensive option of all. 
The rules of the game are shifting: regulatory 
responses to emissions will likely affect energy costs 
and could especially affect balance sheets in 
carbon-intense industries. And bans or limitations 
on such things as single-use plastics or diesel-
fueled cars in city centers will introduce new 
constraints on multiple businesses, many of which 
could find themselves having to catch up. One  
way to get ahead of the future curve is to consider 
repurposing assets right now—for instance, 
converting failing parking garages into uses with 
higher demand, such as residences or day  
care facilities, a trend we’re beginning to see in 
reviving cities.

Foresight flows to the bottom line, and leaning into 
the tailwinds of sustainability presents new oppor-
tunities to enhance investment returns. Tailwinds 
blow strongly in China, for example. The country’s 
imperative to combat air pollution is forecast to 
create more than $3 trillion in investment oppor-
tunities through 2030, ranging across industries 
from air-quality monitoring to indoor air purification 
and even cement mixing.

The personal dynamic
The five links to value creation are grounded in hard 
numbers, but, as always, a softer side is in play. For 
leaders seeking out new ESG opportunities or trying 
to nudge an organization in directions that may  
feel orthogonal to its traditional business model, 
here are a few personal points to keep in mind.

Get specific
It’s important to understand the multiple ways that 
environmental, social, and governmental factors  
can create value, but when it comes to inspiring those 
around you, what will you really be talking about? 
Surprisingly, that depends. The individual causes that 
may inspire any one of us are precisely that—

Taking proper account of investment 
returns requires that you start from  
the proper baseline. When it comes to 
ESG, a do-nothing approach is usually 
an eroding line, not a straight line.

108

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionindividual. That means that the issues most important 
to executives on your team could incline in different 
directions. Large companies can have dozens  
of social, community, or environmental projects in 
motion at any time. Too many at once can be a 
muddle; some may even work at cross-purposes.

In our experience, priority initiatives should be clearly 
articulated, and the number should be no more than 
five. To decide on which ones and to get the most out 
of them, let the company be your lodestar. For one 
leading agribusiness, that means channeling its 
capabilities into ameliorating hunger. The company 
taps its well-honed competencies to work with 
farmers in emerging regions to diversify their crops 
and adopt new technologies, which increases 
production and strengthens the company’s ties with 
different countries and communities.

Even within the same industry, different companies 
will have different ESG profiles depending on their 
position in the corporate life cycle. Attackers 
typically have high upside potential to drive growth 
from ESG initiatives (for instance, the craft brewer 
BrewDog donates 20 percent of its annual profits), 
while longer-established competitors simply don’t 
have that choice. For some companies, such as coal 
businesses or tobacco manufacturers, ESG will be 
more effectively geared to maintaining community 
ties and prioritizing risk avoidance. Regardless of 
your company’s circumstances, it will be the CEO’s 
role to rally support around the initiatives that  
best map to its mission.

Get practical
Value creation should be the CEO’s core message. 
Anything else could sound off-key. Managers, 
especially more senior ones, are usually assessed 
based on performance targets. Under those 
conditions, top-down ESG pronouncements can 
seem distracting or too vague to be of much  
use; “save the planet” won’t cut it. To get everyone 
on board, make the case that your company’s ESG 
priorities do link to value, and show leaders how, 
ideally with hard metrics that feed into the business 

model (for example, output per baseline electricity 
use, waste cost in a given plant or location per 
employee, or revenue per calorie for a food-and-
beverage business).

The case will be simpler if you’ve done the hard  
work to analyze what matters along your value chain, 
where the greatest potential lies, and which areas 
have the most impact for your company. Proactive 
companies carefully research potential initiatives, 
including by tapping thought leaders and industry 
experts, iterate their findings with internal and 
external stakeholders, and then publish the results. 
Making the case publicly—not least to investors—
enforces rigor and helps ensure that practical 
actions will follow.

Get real
An honest appraisal of ESG includes a frank acknowl-
edgment that getting it wrong can result in massive 
value destruction. Being perceived as “overdoing it” 
can sap a leader’s time and focus. Underdoing it is 
even worse. Companies that perform poorly in 
environmental, social, and governance criteria are 
more likely to endure materially adverse events.  
Just in the past few years, multiple companies with  
a weak ESG proposition saw double-digit declines  
in market capitalization in the days and weeks after 
their missteps came to light.12 Leaders should 
vigilantly assess the value at stake from external 
engagement (in our experience, poor external 
engagement can typically destroy about 30 percent 
of value) and plan scenarios for potential hits to 
operating profits. These days, the tail events can 
seem to come out of nowhere, even from a single 
tweet. Playing fast and loose with ESG is playing to 
lose, and failure to confront downside risk forthrightly 
can be disastrous.

Conversely, being thoughtful and transparent  
about ESG risk enhances long-term value—even if 
doing so can feel uncomfortable and engender 
some short-term pain. Ed Stack, the CEO of North 
American retailer Dick’s Sporting Goods, said he 
expected that the company’s 2018 announcement

Five ways that ESG creates value ESG for the long term

Who says that a strong environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) proposition 
cannot create value for companies and 
their shareholders? Not Milton Friedman. 
“It may well be in the long-run interest of a 
corporation,” the economist wrote a 
half-century ago, “to devote resources to 
providing amenities to [its] community  
or to improving its government. That may 
make it easier to attract desirable 
employees, it may reduce the wage bill . . .  
or have other worthwhile effects.”1

Shareholders and stakeholders do not 
compete in a zero-sum game. Quite the 
opposite: building a strong connection with 
broad elements of society creates value, 
not least because it builds resilience into 
the business model. Compromising your 
connections with stakeholders simply to 
make earnings targets, on the other hand, 
destroys value. It’s the essence of short-
termism, measurably and overwhelmingly 
harmful to most shareholders’ economic 
interests. Research shows that firms that 
make significant investments for longer-
term payoffs have future cash flows that 
are discounted less by investors than  
the cash flows of firms that allocate a 
smaller portion of their cash for the long 
term; immediate-minded fixes such as 
share repurchases (which arguably divert 
cash from investments that generate 
longer-term returns) correlate with 
increased discounting as well.2 Businesses 
need to play the long game. That means 
they need to satisfy the needs of their 
customers, employees, and communities—
these days, often a global community—in 

order to maximize value creation. Thriving 
businesses concerned with long-term 
horizons fuel a virtuous cycle. They create 
jobs, increase tax revenue, and raise 
standards of living. ESG helps generate 
wealth, and wealth is not a fixed pie.

at least that.”) The ruling thus proceeded  
to invalidate a poison pill that would have 
allowed Craigslist’s board to execute  
“a business strategy that openly eschews 
stockholder wealth maximization.”3

Different countries come to different 
conclusions about the purpose of business. 
But across legal systems, maximizing 
wealth for the long term demands that 
managers consider trade-offs. In a system 
such as that of the United States, where 
shareholder wealth maximization can have 
the force of law, executives can meet their 
shareholder-minded mission through an 
approach that economist Michael Jensen 
calls an “enlightened value maximization.”4 
Under that framework, managers “spend 
an additional dollar on any constituency 
provided the long-term value added to the 
firm from such expenditure is a dollar or 
more.” That enforces a cost-benefit analysis 
for ESG investments, just as companies 
would do when allocating capital for any 
other purpose and keeping long-term  
value creation in mind.

But just as it’s wrong to assume that 
share holders’ interests must perforce come 
at stakeholders’ expense, one should not 
assume that shareholders’ and stakeholders’ 
interests cannot conflict. Of course they 
can! Should companies pay employees 
more than is necessary to keep them 
engaged and productive, even if doing so 
would place employee interests above 
those of the company as a whole and its 
shareholders in particular?

The question isn’t theoretical—shareholders 
have sued management on that very issue. 
While US courts have typically looked to 
the business-judgment rule, which affords 
directors wide discretion to decide such 
matters, judges have even weighed in about 
shareholder value maximization. For 
example, in 2010, when the directors of 
classifieds site Craigslist admittedly  
sought to run their business without a 
shareholder-maximization objective, 
putting the interests of the community 
above “the business of stockholder  
wealth maximization, now or in the future,” 
the Delaware courts—the most important 
jurisdiction in the United States for  
matters of corporate law—insisted that 
corporations exist to promote value for 
shareholders. (“The ‘Inc.’ after the company 
name,” the deciding court said, “has to mean

and he was right: by his own estimate, the announce-
ment cost the company $150 million in lost sales, or 
slightly less than 2 percent of yearly revenue. Yet the 
company’s stock climbed 14 percent in a little over  
a year following the shift.

One reason for the resilience of Dick’s Sporting 
Goods may be that gun sales were already a declining 
part of the company’s portfolio. Another reason was 
that it remained stubbornly committed to its sense 
of purpose. Researchers have found that the market 
capitalization of firms increases with stakeholder 
support, particularly in times when peer stakeholders 
criticize or attack firm operations.13 Holding to  
your company’s central values is particularly essential 
today as polarized forces widen the social gyre. 
“Fueled in part by social media, public pressures on 
corporations build faster and reach further than  
ever before,” BlackRock’s Larry Fink observed in  

his highly influential 2019 letter to CEOs.14 Fink argued 
that “[a]s divisions continue to deepen, companies 
must demonstrate their commitment to the countries, 
regions, and communities where they operate.” 
Walking the talk on purpose strengthens the com-
pany and its community. “Profits,” Fink notably 
concluded, “are in no way inconsistent with purpose—
in fact, profits and purpose are inextricably linked.” 
(For more about foundational perspectives, see 
sidebar, “ESG for the long term.”)

The linkage from ESG to value creation is solid indeed. 
Five levers in particular, across the bottom and  
top lines, can be difference makers. In a world where 
environmental, social, and governmental concerns 
are becoming more urgent than ever, leaders should 
keep those connections in mind.

Five ways that ESG creates value 2020

Investors remind  
business leaders: 
Governance matters

Activists continue to poke holes in corporate performance and returns, but 
they are having their greatest success with governance structures. Here’s 
how to think about their moves. 

by Michael Birshan, Madeleine Goerg, Anna Moore, and Ellora-Julie Parekh

For many businesses, governance remains a less 
discussed area of vulnerability. That is in part 
because it involves internal systems, controls, and 
procedures, which, in many cases, are less visible  
to stake holders and the broader public. For instance, 
stakeholders can’t always tell if boards and senior-
management teams are preempting regulatory 
violations or communicating clearly with regulators 
above and beyond standard reporting—until it’s  
too late.2

In the wake of the global pandemic, boards will play 
a key role in guiding their organizations into the next 
normal. Indeed, this may well be the moment when 
boards and leadership teams prove their value—or 
show their flaws.

Companies that don’t regularly review and address 
governance issues may be ignoring them at their 
own peril. Governance-related demands by activist 
investors around the world rose from just 27 in  
2009 to about 1,400 in 2019. These demands reflect 
activists’ interest in a broad range of sectors, 
including the financial-services, basic-materials, 
energy, business-services, and technology  
sectors (Exhibit 1).3

Even before the spread of the novel coronavirus 
(SARS-CoV-2),1 investors were calling on senior-
management teams and corporate boards to focus 
on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
concerns. Investors were, for example, prompting 
companies to consider questions of purpose and  
to pay more attention to the impact of their actions 
on the envi ronment. Now the pendulum is  
swinging toward social issues raised by the spread  
of COVID-19—for instance, worker safety and  
rising unemployment.

What’s more, about 70 percent of all activist-investor 
demands over the past decade have focused on 
governance, and many have garnered support from 
proxy advisers.4 Governance is also increasingly top 
of mind for institutional investors. 

Activists’ demands fall into two broad categories: 
structural and personnel related. They cover  
a range of issues, including board composition, 

remuneration, accountability, voting rights, and 
leadership changes (see sidebar, “Two categories of 
investor concerns”). Governance-related demands 
have not only out numbered others over the past 
decade but also more success fully achieved their 
targeted out comes (Exhibit 2).5 A typical example of 
such demands involves a manufacturer’s delay  
in disclosing a trans action appropriately, as well as 
accusations that its executives had bought votes.

and increased innova tion—and can strengthen 
shareholder relations. 

As the manufacturer and many other compa nies 
have learned the hard way, it’s always better to be 
your own activist rather than have demands  
thrust upon you. Executives and board members 
should respond to increased external pressures  
by continually reviewing their governance efforts 
and considering the best ways to shore up their 
governance credentials. These efforts have an added 
bonus: a strong governance program can promote 
success in many other parts of the business—
includ ing improved operations, motivated talent,  

In this article, we’ll examine the primary governance 
factors that activist shareholders have targeted  
and the ways in which some of their concerns  
were mitigated.

Quantifying the concerns
Not all governance proposals from shareholders are 
created equal. It’s important for companies to 
quantify the number and type of possible activist 
overtures. Some of them focus on improving 
management fundamentals, others suggest board 

114

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionor leadership changes to give activists seats  
at the table, and still others propose what may be 
sensible measures for unlocking value. 

Data from Activist Insight show that personnel-
related demands—to gain board representation and 
change leadership, for instance—have accounted 
for more than 40 percent of all governance-related 
pro posals since 2009. The other 60 percent or so 
have focused on structural concerns. An industrial 
manufacturer, for example, faced an internal  
investi gation after several quarters of operational 
issues. It then decided to delay the announcement  

of quarterly results. These problems and a related 
decrease in share price prompted activists to demand 
more frequent earnings dis closures and the election 
of independent external directors to the board.  
The manufacturer swiftly agreed, and the results were 
greater transparency and, ultimately, increased 
corporate value. 

Shoring up governance credentials 
Conducting frequent governance reviews is not only 
a good hedge against demands from activist 
investors and other shareholders but also simply

Our research shows that activist investors’ 
corporate-governance concerns, while 
many and varied, tend to fall in two broad 
categories: structural or related  
to personnel. 

Demands relating to structural concerns 
typically focus on the following five areas:

 — board composition and independence—
the annual election of directors, the 
introduction of minimum requirements 
for the number of independent directors, 
changes to the number of board  
seats, and transparency about who is 
being appointed to top positions and 
about succession planning

access to shareholder lists, and the 
results of internal investigations 

 — voting rights—majority voting at

or repeal of poison-pill or shareholder-
rights plans, and the implementation  
of a universal proxy card so shareholders 
can vote for individual director 
nominees or oppose proxy contests for

performance of individuals or teams.

part of good corpo rate hygiene. Companies  
often don’t conduct such reviews because their 
management teams are under less pressure  
to focus on these capabilities than they are on 
others. What’s more, the acknowledgement  
of the direct links between good governance and 
value creation is a recent development in many 
companies. Our research and experience in the field 
suggest that businesses can take several steps  
to anticipate activists’ concerns and shore up their 
governance credentials.

Change the board’s composition
Activist share holders are demanding more diverse, 
expert, committed, and independent boards.  
Rising shareholder expectations are prompting 
companies to bring in new profiles, adjust the  
sizes of boards, and review board-member terms 
and renewals. For similar reasons, a large company 
under pressure from activist shareholders cut  
its directors’ terms to two years, from three, and 
reduced the size of its board to nine members,  
from 11. As a result of this board shake-up, four long-
standing board members will step down by the end 
of 2020 or 2021 to allay concerns over a lack of 
sector-specific expertise and independence from 
the CEO. 

Companies shouldn’t wait to be prompted by activist 
shareholders to act. They should create more 
inclusive and professional boards by proactively 
adding to (and, if appropriate, shaking up) the 
current composition of the groups, clarifying 
expectations for board members, and reviewing 
their level of engagement. Such reviews could 
include a detailed comparison between the current 
directors’ skills and a competency matrix (the  
skills the company deems critical). They could also 
consider the directors’ prior affiliations with  
the company, potential conflicts of interest, and  
the board’s overall responsiveness.

methods are fair. They are asking, for instance, if the 
remuneration is tied to performance or to specific 
ESG metrics and if it’s in line with the remuneration 
at peer companies. Aiming to align pay with 
performance, activist shareholders of one industrial 
conglomerate pushed to change the performance 
targets for all its top executives. The activists sought 
to cut the bonuses for those executives whose 
businesses had recorded losses in 2017, including 
those of the CEO and CFO. 

To anticipate activists’ concerns about pay and 
performance, companies can, for instance, ensure 
that they have clear and communicable metrics  
that support their decisions on remuneration. 
Reacting to a public ESG campaign by a group of 
share holders, a major oil and gas company decided 
to link the compensation of more than 1,000 of  
its top employees to its success in meeting reduced 
carbon-emissions targets.

Communicate clearly 
When companies are involved in major transactions, 
investigations, or audits, shareholders look for full 
transparency. In one large company, shareholders 
stepped in to demand a governance overhaul,  
given their concerns about an acquisition decision 
made by the board. As a result, the company  
created a board-level committee to consider the 
interests of noncontrolling shareholders in all  
major decisions. 

To limit speculation and dispel concerns, it’s critical 
for senior managers and boards to give stake holders 
coherent narratives about major decisions and  
their potential effects on corporate performance. 
Establishing a rhythm of clear, frequent, and 
comprehensive updates on such decisions, as well 
as a mechanism for disseminating follow-on  
reports and metrics to key stakeholders, can help 
allay shareholder concerns.

Clarify your remuneration policy
Shareholders increasingly want to understand how 
senior managers and boards have arrived at their 
levels of leadership remuneration and whether the

Given the pace of change in business and the world 
today, shareholders are demanding that companies 
adopt faster decision-making processes. Reviewing 

116

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionhow shareholders participate (for example, by 
testing how voting rules affect shareholder 
engagement) can help keep up with changing 
shareholder expectations. A majority vote,  
for instance, is becoming the standard for board 
elections. According to the 2019 US Spencer  
Stuart Board Index, 89 percent of boards in the 
United States require directors to resign if they  
fail to receive a majority of the share holders’ votes, 
compared with just 65 percent in 2009.6 More  
and more companies must also submit proposals for 
poison pills, takeover defenses, and other matters 
for ratification by shareholders. 

instance, was directly linked to shareholder 
pressure to align with the targets of the 2015 Paris 
Agreement. To head off the activists’ concerns, 
senior-management teams and boards can regularly 
review their portfolios of business activities  
and map their impact on major global initiatives.  
A growing number of companies benchmark

The state of internal 
carbon pricing

More and more companies are experimenting with internal carbon 
charges—but are their pricing thresholds correct?

could affect their P&L statements and investment 
choices. Internal carbon pricing was a key factor, for 
instance, in a European energy company’s decision 
to close several power plants, as the internal charge 
on increased carbon emissions cut into the 
expected profitability of those plants. Meanwhile, 
some US financial-services companies are using 
internal carbon pricing to identify low-carbon, high-
return investment opportunities.

To better understand who is using internal carbon 
pricing and in which industries, we looked at  
data from companies that have disclosed information 
from their internal carbon-pricing programs.1 Our 
research reveals growing interest and high variability 
in companies’ use of these internal charges. 
Specifically, 23 percent of the approximately  
2,600 companies in our data set indicated they are 
using an internal carbon charge, and another  
22 percent plan to do so in the next two years. Of the 
top 100 companies in our global data set (based  
on 2019 revenue), the ones that most frequently 
reported using internal carbon pricing were those in 
the energy, materials, and financial industries.  
They were followed closely by the technology and 
industrial sectors (Exhibit 1). 

A geographic breakdown shows that 28 percent of 
companies in Europe are using internal carbon 
pricing. Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United

Business leaders know that sustainable growth is 
possible only when they anticipate inevitable shifts 
in policy, social norms, and technology that could 
affect their companies. One of the most prominent 
of these so-called transition risks is in the area of 
carbon emissions and the potential introduction of a 
universal price on carbon. 

Given impending policy changes in this area,  
and with an eye toward protecting the health and 
livelihoods of customers and employees, some 
companies are experimenting with internal carbon 
pricing. That is, some companies are setting an 
internal charge on the amount of carbon dioxide 
emitted from assets and investment projects so they 
can see how, where, and when their emissions

selecting values that are most useful within their 
own business contexts and regions (Exhibit 2).

A closer look at the data also shows that companies’ 
thresholds for the price per metric ton of carbon 
used vary widely by region and industry. In Europe, 
for instance, the median internal charge is $27 per 
metric ton, while in Asia, it’s $18. This isn’t 
necessarily surprising, as there are currently no 
formal, defined global standards for pricing of 

Attempts to help companies identify optimal  
pricing standards are under way. Economists and 
advocacy groups have posited a broad range of 
potential pricing levels—from just a few dollars to 
well over $100 per metric ton, depending on the  
discount rate used—but the topic remains a point of 
contention.2 For instance, the Environmental Defense 
Fund, a not-for-profit environmental-advocacy

impact of carbon in the future. There are different frameworks for evaluating which discount rates to use—for example, internal carbon pricing 
based on market-based discount rates (which result in lower charges), ethics-driven discount rates (which result in higher charges),  
“descriptive” approaches determined by economic price, and “prescriptive” approaches that conform to an ideal. See Lawrence H. Goulder and 
Roberton C. Williams III, “The choice of discount rate for climate change policy evaluation,” Climate Change Economics, 2012, Volume 3,

is greater than $50 per metric ton emitted. It 
recognizes, however, that this figure could be low 
because it doesn’t yet factor in all potential 
externalities from the impact of climate change.3

Meanwhile, the High-Level Commission on Carbon 
Prices has estimated that companies would need to 
set internal carbon pricing between $40 and  
$80 per metric ton in 2020 and between $50 and 

$100 per metric ton by 2030 to reduce emissions  
so they are in line with the standards set in the Paris 
Agreement.4 By contrast, most of the companies 
that report using internal carbon pricing have  
set their thresholds at around $40 per metric ton. 
French company Danone, for instance, publicly 
reports its carbon-adjusted EPS using an internal 
carbon pricing of €35 per metric ton emitted. 
Danone’s adjusted EPS has grown faster than its 
regular EPS has because of the company’s

When sustainability 
becomes a factor in 
valuation

Sustainability efforts are material to investors only to the extent that they 
affect cash flows. What matters depends on the industry.

Bailey to discuss how accepted principles of 
valuation apply. Koller, an author of Valuation: 
Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies,1 
has argued that “creating shareholder value  
is not the same as maximizing short-term profits—
and companies that confuse the two often put  
both shareholder value and stakeholder interests at 
risk.”2 In this conversation, Bailey and Koller dig  
into the issues related to how sustainability affects 
value, the asymmetry of information between 
companies and their investors, and how companies 
communicate about that information.

Jonathan Bailey: How does your thinking about 
valuation reflect today’s focus by many stakeholders 
on sustainability and how it’s changed over time?

Tim Koller: I think we have to separate the 
mechanics of valuation from what managers should 
be doing to maximize a company’s value and how 
investors react to the whole thing. For hundreds of 
years, the value of a company has ultimately come 
down to the cash flows it generated. That’s what you 
can spend as an owner, whether you’re a private 
owner or whether you’re a shareholder in a  
large company. 

Now, there have been periods of time when people 
said, “Oh, the rules are changing.” For example,

Investors and other stakeholders seeking to 
understand companies’ risks and opportunities 
increasingly demand to know more about their 
performance related to sustainability concerns—or 
more specifically, environmental, social, and 
governance issues. Companies generally disclose 
variables that have a material effect on their  
value, according to financial accounting standards. 
But a one-size-fits-all approach to disclosure 
misses meaningful differences among industries.

In this December 2016 interview, excerpted from a 
conversation at the inaugural symposium of the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), 
McKinsey’s Tim Koller joined alumnus Jonathan

during the dot-com bubble, all of a sudden, people 
said, “Traditional methods of valuation don’t  
make sense anymore—look at all these companies 
with high valuations that have nothing to do with 
cash flow.” Well, ultimately, it was the lack of cash 
flow that brought those companies’ valuations  
back down. 

Sustainability issues aren’t any different from other 
things management has to worry about. If the forces 
in the world that relate to sustainability are going  
to be material to a business, it’s management’s job 
to take a longer view and figure out what to do  
about them. Because eventually, these things will 
affect cash flows. And what’s good about SASB’s 
approach is its focus on how different sustainability 
factors might materially affect the cash flows of 
companies in 79 different industries. 

From the perspective of how investors react,  
one thing we find is that managers have a lot more 
information than investors—and long before 
investors have it. So sometimes the markets lag 
behind in their valuations because some important 
factor is too vague or unclear for investors to see 
how it might affect a company’s cash flows. When it 
does become clear, the markets do react. If you  

look at the way oil and gas companies are valued,  
for example, people say, “There will be all these 
stranded assets out there. Some oil reserves won’t 
be produced because of the growth of alternative 
energy sources.” When you look closely, the market’s 
already discounting those concerns. Investors  
are assuming that there’s not much value beyond  
a certain period of time, which isn’t too far into  
the future. 

Jonathan Bailey: That requires managers to be able 
to think about the long-term horizon, internal budget 
processes, and capital-allocation decisions with 
materiality in mind. In my experience with corporate 
clients, there are often dynamics in the way that 
people think about creating value within a business 
that seem to be a little less than efficient. 

From your perspective, thinking about it more  
in terms of corporate finance, what would you say 
are some of the things we need to overcome in  
order to help managers do a better job of integrating 
these longer-term goals, like sustainability?

Tim Koller: When managers make decisions, they 
always work off some baseline of performance.  
One trap they fall into is ignoring what really would 

‘ With regard to sustainability, if  
a company can do things that make 
customers more likely to buy from  
it than from a competitor ... those things 
are all going to be positive. But  
what are the consequences ... of not 
doing something?’

When sustainability becomes a factor in valuation

happen, relative to the baseline, if they didn’t do 
something. For example, what are the conse-
quences of not doing an acquisition? Maybe they 
won’t be able to achieve their base case. Or, for 
another example, if they don’t invest in safety, the 
effect on the baseline isn’t that safety would 
increase their cash flow—but rather that it reduces 
the probability of having lower cash flows.

So one thing managers need to be more thoughtful 
about is which elements actually create value in  
and of themselves. With regard to sustainability, if a 
company can do things that make customers more 
likely to buy from it than from a competitor, because 
it has better credentials, those things are all going to 
be positive. But what are the consequences,  
relative to the baseline, of not doing something? 
What if a company doesn’t invest in safety, for 
example? Or if it doesn’t invest in environmental 
mitigation? Or if it builds a plant in such a way  
that it can’t be operated under future regulations  
as opposed to today’s? That’s really the challenge 
for managers. If they don’t do these things,  
what’s likely to happen? And it’s not going to be 
business as usual.

Jonathan Bailey: I know some of the work you’ve 
been doing recently has been on communication 
between managers and investors. Given the 
informa tion asymmetry you mentioned, what do the 
best companies do to communicate how they’ll 
create value in a way that investors should care 
about—in the context of sustainability issues?

Tim Koller: I think we’re still in a very infant stage 
with regard to this. Some of the reporting by 
companies is still boilerplate. But there are some 
good examples. For instance, some of the consumer-
apparel companies have become very conscious 
about their overseas sourcing. They’re becoming 
more proactive about describing what they do  
to make sure that suppliers are upholding certain 
standards. You can also see it in extraction or 
energy-related industries, where they’re worried 
about sustainability issues. You can see it in 

healthcare, where they’re ultimately concerned 
about product safety. 

Unfortunately, communication often doesn’t  
happen until after there’s been a blowup somewhere 
in the industry—situations where, all of a sudden, 
something happens that gets everyone’s attention, 
and people start to worry about it. 

Jonathan Bailey: Another trend we’ve seen is in the 
growth of information available to investors. 
Whether it’s from what they learn from company 
disclosures, from data providers (which may  
not be from disclosure), from trawling news media,  
or from building input-output models that compile  
a view of what’s happening inside a business  
on sustainability characteristics. 

From an investor perspective, do you feel that this is 
really just a trend toward more data or is it really 
important to focus on better data?

Tim Koller: I think it’s about the better data. There 
are investors who look at a Bloomberg screen to 
make investment decisions, and having sustainability 
factors available there provides a lot of visibility to 
the issues. But the investors who drive the market 
are typically much deeper than that. They’re going to 
spend a month doing their research before they 
decide to make an investment in a company. They’re 
going to follow it for a long period of time. They’re 
going to be more interested in what material factors 
may drive the company’s value.

What ultimately matters, we’ve learned from 
sophisticated long-term investors, is the importance 
of management credibility.3 It’s not so much about 
the amount of data. It’s that managers, when facing 
those investors one on one, are able to talk about 
what’s really going to matter, what’s going to drive 
the cash flows, and what’s being done about it.

So the disclosures are good because they get  
the conversation going. But whether or not they’re 
mandated or audited, what really matters to  

3  Rebecca Darr and Tim Koller, “How to build an alliance against corporate short-termism,” McKinsey, January 30, 2017.

124

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionthose investors is, when they’re face to face  
with management, whether they have a sense that 
management really knows what they’re talking 
about and what they’re doing about it.

Jonathan Bailey: That’s an interesting point, 
because you’ll often hear CEOs say, “Look, I never 
get questions from sell-side analysts about these 
sorts of topics.” But it’s probably the case that those 
conversations are happening in a different forum. 
They’re not happening on a quarterly earnings call—
they’re happening in those one-on-one meetings 
with a value-based investor who has a much more 
active focus.

So if you’re sitting there as a CEO trying proactively  
to have that conversation, do you think that 
management teams are doing the best they can to 
structure the right conversations? Or do you think, 
on the whole, managers are basically waiting for 
people to come to them, and the loudest voices will 
be the ones that shape the discussion?

Tim Koller: It’s a combination of the two, because 
there are two worlds going on. There are the 
quarterly earnings and the sell-side analysts, and 
then there are the actual investors, who tend  

to have private conversations with managers. And 
those worlds don’t intersect for the most part.

When executives sit down with what we call intrinsic 
investors, the conversation is much deeper, and it 
does focus on what’s material, whether it’s sustain-
ability or other things that are affecting the industry. 
They talk about, “What’s going on there? How is 
management reacting?”—getting a sense of whether 
management knows what they’re doing. That’s a 
sharp contrast from the quarterly calls, where 
usually only the sell-side asks questions.

I was talking to one investor-relations professional 
who’s been in the business for decades who said 
that only once did a buy-side investor actually ask to 
join a quarterly call. There are ways to improve that. 
When we talk to long-term investors, they would like 
management to be more proactive in those 
quarterly calls. They say, “Tell us what you really think 
is important. Don’t try to guess what the sell-side 
analysts want to know. Tell us about the results in the 
context of what you’re doing longer term. And  
then find a way to make sure that the most important 
questions about the long term get raised. Take 
charge of investor communications and focus on 
what’s really important.”

Investing in sustainability:

screened out “sin sectors” such as tobacco. 
Subsequent evolutions tilted toward rewarding good 
performers, largely in the extraction industries,  
on the basis of often fuzzy criteria promulgated by 
the corporate social-responsibility movement. 
These early approaches tended to force an 
unacceptable trade-off between social criteria  
and investment returns.

Three years ago, former US Vice President Al Gore 
and David Blood, previously the head of Goldman 
Sachs Asset Management, set out to put sustain-
ability investing firmly in the mainstream of  
equity analysis. Their firm, Generation Investment 
Management, engages in primary research that 
integrates sustainability with fundamental equity 
analysis. Based in London and Washington, DC, 
Generation has 23 employees, 12 of whom are 
invest  ment professionals, and a single portfolio 
invested, at any given time, in 30 to 50 publicly  
listed global companies.

The two partners recently sat down with McKinsey’s 
Lenny Mendonca and Jeremy Oppenheim to  
discuss reconciling sustainability and socially 
responsible investing with the creation of long-term 
shareholder value.

As McKinsey research indicates, executives around 
the world increasingly recognize that the creation  
of long-term shareholder value depends on a 
corpora tion’s ability to understand and respond to 
increasingly intense demands from society.1 It is  
no surprise, then, that the topic of socially responsible 
investing has been gaining ground as investors  
seek to incorporate concepts like sustainability and 
responsible corporate behavior into their assess-
ments of a company’s long-term value.

Yet socially responsible investing has always been 
an awkward science. Early approaches simplistically 

1   The research, summarized in “The McKinsey Global Survey of Business Executives: Business and Society, January 2006” (McKinsey Quarterly, 

web exclusive, January 2006), indicates that 84 percent of executives think business has a broader contract with society.

McKinsey: What do you mean by the term 
“sustainability,” and how does it influence your 
investment philosophy?

the architecture that we believed was essential to 
address the challenges in the investment-
management industry.

David Blood: Sustainability investing is the explicit 
recognition that social, economic, environmental, 
and ethical factors directly affect business strategy—
for example, how companies attract and retain 
employees, how they manage the risks and create 
opportunities from climate change, a company’s 
culture, corporate-governance standards, 
stakeholder-engagement strategies, philanthropy, 
reputation, and brand management. These  
factors are particularly important today given  
the widening of societal expectations of  
corporate responsibility.

Al Gore: When, several years ago, David and I were 
separately looking for ways to integrate sustainability 
into investing, mutual friends told each of us of  
the other’s search. We discovered immediately that 
we had a common goal, and that led to a series  
of meetings and a friendship and, ultimately, to a 
decision to form a partnership. We researched  
the history of sustainable investing under its various 
names and decided to start a new partnership in 
order to design it, from the ground up, according to 

McKinsey: What did the history of sustainability 
investing teach you?

David Blood: Sustainability investing has a long 
history, starting back with the first wave of negative-
screening strategies, where investors excluded 
entire sectors based on a set of ethical criteria. This 
strategy remained niche; returns were lackluster 
due to the fact that your investment-opportunity set 
was limited. The next wave of sustainability 
investing was called the positive-screening, or best-
in-class, approach. That’s the philosophy of the  
Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes and the KLD 
Broad Market Social Index—these indexes replicate 
the underlying benchmarks but select only  
the best performers on environmental, social, and 
governance parameters.

However, the problem with this approach is that it’s 
difficult to get a real sense of what’s happening in 
those businesses, because it’s basically a one-size-
fits-all approach, often using questionnaires for 
decision making. In addition, often one team does 

‘ Sustainability investing is the explicit 
recognition that social, economic, 
environmental, and ethical factors 
directly affect business strategy.... These

today given the widening of societal 
expectations of corporate responsibility.’

the sustainability research and then hands it over to 
the investment team to do the financial research. 
That approach, we believe, has too much friction in it 
because it misses the explicit acknowledgment  
that sustainability issues are integral to business 
strategy. So in setting up Generation, we saw  
the need to fully understand sustainability issues 
alongside the fundamental financial analysis  
of a company.

Al Gore: We don’t think it’s acceptable to force a 
choice between investing according to our values or 
according to the ways most likely to get us the best 
return on investment. Our objective in innovating with 
this new model was to focus on the best return for 
our clients, full stop. But we wanted to do so in a way 
that fully integrates sustainability into the model.

McKinsey: That suggests greater complexity.

David Blood: Yes, sustainability research is 
complicated because it requires you to think long 
term and to think about the first- and second-order 
effects of an issue. We like to describe our approach 
to sustainability research as taking a systems view. 

What that means is, if you’re thinking about climate 
change you first need to understand the physical, 
regulatory, and behavioral impacts on business. But 
you also need to understand what a changing 
climate means for disease migration and public 
health, what it means for poor populations in 
developing countries, what it means for water scarcity 
or demographic and urbanization trends. The  
most important and challenging research is trying to 
determine how all these factors interact. Without 
that understanding, you can miss a significant part 
of the business implications.

McKinsey: What principles drive your approach?

David Blood: The first principle, categorically, is that 
it is best practice to take a long-term approach to 
investing. We think that the focus on “short termism” 
in the marketplace is detrimental to economies, 
detrimental to value creation, detrimental to capital 
markets, and a bad investment strategy. It’s  
common corporate-finance knowledge that 
something on the order of 60 to 80 percent of the  
value of a business lies in its long-term cash flows. 

128

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionAnd if you’re investing with a short-term horizon 
you’re giving up the value creation of a business.

The second principle is that the context of business 
is clearly changing. We are now confronting the 
limits of our ecological system, and at the same time 
societal expectations of business are widening. On 
top of that, multinational businesses are oftentimes 
better positioned than governments to deal with 
some of the most complicated global challenges, 
such as climate change, HIV/AIDS, water scarcity, 
and poverty. Technology and communications have 
changed, and we’ve reached a point where civil 
society is now demanding a response from business.

McKinsey: What’s your perspective on how that 
changes corporate strategy?

David Blood: In effect what’s happening, 
unbeknownst to many corporate leaders, is that the 
goalposts for their businesses’ license to operate 
have moved. There are higher expectations and 
more serious consequences, and the implications  
go way beyond protecting your reputation or 
managing costs. Rather, we see this changing 
context for business as an opportunity for 
companies to establish competitive positioning, 
grow revenues, and drive profitability. In the  
end, that’s the holy grail of sustainability investing—
to seize the opportunities, not just avoid the risks.

McKinsey: What has been the reception from 
pension funds and longer-term investors to  
this notion?

Investing in sustainability: An interview with Al Gore and David Blood

129

David Blood: Very good. They recognize that they 
have long-term liabilities, and it is their fiduciary duty 
to match those liabilities with assets. The recent 
adoption of the UN’s Principles for Responsible 
Investment by asset owners and managers repre-
senting over $8 trillion is a good example of the 
institutional-investment community beginning to 
commit to a long-term time horizon and the  
explicit recognition that environmental, social, and 
governance factors drive value creation.

From Generation’s perspective, we’re pleased with 
this awakening. If you go back to when we founded 
this firm, we thought that sustainability investing 
would eventually be mainstream, but we never would 
have guessed that the reception and focus on 
sustainability would be as loud and as urgent as it  
is today versus three years ago.

McKinsey: Why do you think that is?

David Blood: It’s because people realize that there 
are reputation issues related to sustainability,  
but they also recognize that, in the end, this is about 
driving profitability and competitive position.  
Asset owners are beginning to get this and they  
are looking to invest in the companies that 
understand it.

Al Gore: The market is long on short, and short on 
long. There’s a widespread recognition within  
the industry that what has emerged over time doesn’t 
really make any sense. They know that it needs to 
change and they are ready for change.

We are in a period of history, right now, when the 
contextual changes are larger than the ones  
we’ve been used to in the past. Changes that we’ve 
associated with very long cycles are now fore-
shortened and are occurring much more rapidly. 
Positioning a company to ride out these changes and 
profit from them often means making stretch 
investments to change the infrastructure, change the 
energy source, change the physical plant, and  
adapt to the new realities. And if there is the tyranny 
of a three-month cycle, then companies won’t make 
those investments. So focusing only on the quarter 
can blind you to the most important factors of all.

McKinsey: How many executives really understand 
the complexity and interconnection of the trends 
you describe?

Al Gore: It’s a rapidly growing number. I recently 
spoke at a conference in Copenhagen, focused on 
carbon trading, with thousands of companies 
represented. As part of an internal survey, attendees 
were asked how many of them had internalized their 
“carbon budget” and begun to drive down their 
internal emissions.

A year ago it was 15 percent. This year it was  
65 percent. That would correspond with what we’ve 
found in multiple other areas—a kind of tipping  
point that we are at right now. For example, I had a 
chance to visit Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas, 
around the time they launched their commitment to 
“green” their supply chain. And David and I spent 
time with [GE CEO] Jeff Immelt, and we could give 
you lots of other examples of CEOs who, a few  
years ago, might not have talked this way and yet  
are now not only knowledgeable but highly 
sophisticated. They may have started with concerns 
about brand protection and reputation and the  
like. But once they got into it, it was as if a whole new 
world of opportunity and new markets opened up.

McKinsey: What do those executives and companies 
that are doing this well see differently?

David Blood: The first is that they understand  
their long-term strategy. Secondly, they understand 
the drivers of their business—both financial and 
nonfinancial. The leading CEOs are the ones who 
explicitly recognize that sustainability factors  
drive business strategy.

In our minds, the best businesses have always 
understood the importance of culture and 
employees and ethics. And they get it in their soul. 
But what’s now becoming true—particularly for  
the industrials, the retailers, the pharmaceuticals, 
the utilities, and a broader array of industries— 
is that managers are realizing that there are broader 
factors affecting how they operate. They can 
recognize that over the next 25 years their strategy 
will depend on leveraging new opportunities

of business.

McKinsey: Can you give us an example?

case. Can you get there in tobacco? Fast food?  
Or are these just sectors that are fundamentally, 
somehow, no-go territory?

Al Gore: In Denmark, Novo Nordisk clearly gets this. 
They take a holistic view and a long-term view.  
They look at the whole system. Take their presence 
in China. They went into China at a very early  
stage with genuine concern for what they could  
do to help forestall the diabetes epidemic there, 
which is growing at a faster rate than it is in the rest 
of the world due to the transition to a Western diet 
and lifestyle.

Novo Nordisk has 60 percent of the Chinese market 
for insulin and they’re focusing their business  
plan on trying to cure and prevent diabetes. If they 
succeed then presumably sales of insulin will  
not increase at the current rate, but they think the 
problem is large enough that it is more important to 
address the root cause of the problem. This 
commitment comes out of the phenomena that 
David was just describing to you.

David Blood: There are material sustainability 
challenges in all industries. In the fast-food or food-
manufacturing industry, there’s a very strong move 
toward healthy living and eating, organic food,  
and the implications for sustainable agriculture. And  
how do food companies deal with the upstream 
challenges of these trends, challenges such as water 
use? While we don’t invest in it, the tobacco sector 
faces a whole host of issues which are very much 
sustainability driven—not just the health impact of 
the product. But, again, sustainable agriculture is  
a big story, as is litigation risk. In another sector, like 
financial services, the key sustainability issue is  
how a company manages its human capital. In the 
energy sector, climate change is one of the most 
significant issues. In the health care sector, we look 
at ethical marketing practices between companies 
and doctors. Even in industries like luxury goods 
there are issues around excessive materialism, 
authenticity, and consumption.

McKinsey: Is this approach possible in all sectors? 
Clearly, the pharmaceutical industry is an interesting

based approach to investing. Rather than looking

at 50 different tick-box sustainability criteria, we 
think you need to tackle the three or four long-term 
issues that will really affect corporate profitability.

McKinsey: What examples come to mind of 
companies that have thought beyond managing 
sustainability risks and moved on to creating 
revenue opportunities?

David Blood: A company like Johnson Controls, for 
example, is interesting because of its focus on 
demand-side energy efficiency. About 50 percent  
of its business is batteries for hybrid cars and 
products to run buildings efficiently; the other  
50 percent is automotive interiors and controls. We 
think it’s the former that’s going to be growing and 
driving that company. They understand that their 
products will help reduce their clients’ environmental 
footprint. This strategy is completely revenue  
driven. GE’s Ecomagination is another example. If 
you think about how GE’s stock price is going to 
trade, it’s going to trade primarily on growth. Jeffrey 
Immelt knows this. He’s betting his reputation and 
his company on the notion that the businesses 
related to the environment will enable GE to grow 
faster than GDP. In Mexico we cover two Mexican 
home builders that are linked to demographic  
trends and to the very strong demand and need for 
affordable housing in Mexico.

These are just some examples of how companies can 
see sustainability trends as growth opportunities or 
as new niches for existing products and services.

the European Union, I would ask questions about how 
long it will be before my fiduciary responsibility 
required attention to the aggressive management of 
carbon. Because even though natural resources  
are not depreciated and even though pollution is 
treated as an externality and a reputation risk, where 
regulations and laws are involved, pollution now has 
an economic cost. And that cost is increasing.

McKinsey: Do you assess how the board compen-
sates the chief executive?

David Blood: Remuneration is a very specific area 
that we look at. In line with all the things we’ve 
already talked about, perverse short-term incentives 
in the financial system obviously are manifested at a 
corporate level by remuneration structures.

McKinsey: What must CEOs do more of?

David Blood: Some are taking on a host of issues 
and seeing the interlinkages, but there’s an enormous 
segment that is still single-issue focused. I think 
managing and understanding climate risk is the first 
wedge into that. You would hope that people then 
start to look at the second-order effects of climate 
change. I think one of the biggest things that  
CEOs can do is explain their longer-term story to the 
capital markets more forcefully. Increasingly,  
the research community is interested in the 
environmental, social, and governance factors that 
drive company strategy and is integrating these 
factors into mainstream research.

McKinsey: One of the important interfaces between 
the investing world and management is the board. 
What role do boards of directors play in trying to 
ensure that this kind of mind-set is embedded in 
corporate activity and communicated to investors?

McKinsey: Can we explore climate change a bit 
more deeply? How do you think about that from an 
investing standpoint and what do you think that 
business should be doing that would help not just with 
climate change but with investment returns?

Al Gore: I think that the board of directors has a 
growing responsibility to address these very topics. 
As stewards of shareholder interests, boards should 
be focused on the long-term sustainability of the 
firm rather than on the market noise. If I were on the 
board of a company doing business primarily in  

Al Gore: There is a big story and opportunity around 
the supply side of cleaner energy. We would look  
for companies to recognize that carbon constraints  
will be more aggressive in the future. So we would 
expect to see opportunity in businesses that  
are involved with lower-carbon energy, including 

132

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionrenewable-energy provision, such as wind, solar, 
and cellulosic ethanol2 production. Or in businesses 
that are involved in cleaning up traditional fossil 
energy, which we see as a very big trend. Or  
in compa nies that are involved in technologies  
like carbon capture and storage (CCS) and 
sequestration-ready power plants.3

The demand side, we also think, is an under-
appreciated opportunity. The efficiency of buildings—
insulation, specifically—is low-hanging fruit in  
terms of economic opportunity. The technology has 
existed for some time; it just needs to be deployed 
and implemented more effectively. There are also 
demand-side opportunities around sustainable 
mobility and transportation—for example, growth in 
hybrid vehicles or lightweight materials in vehicles.

McKinsey: What other indicators do you look for in 
gauging a company’s approach to addressing a 
sustainability issue such as climate change?

David Blood: In addition to helping us assess the 
quality of a business model, a company’s response to 
the climate challenge can tell us an enormous amount 

about a management team. We use its response  
and engagement in the issue as sort of a litmus test 
or a lens into the quality of the team. A company’s 
lobbying practices are also an interesting line of 
inquiry around climate change. Auto companies are 
telling people that they’re wonderfully green  
all of a sudden, but it’s important to evaluate if they 
are concurrently lobbying against emissions 
reductions, for example. That gets you to the heart 
of what is the real truth in a company’s culture. If 
they’re lobbying for something different than what 
they’re telling everybody, you’ve got a problem.

McKinsey: Any final thoughts for executives  
trying to understand this trend toward sustain-
ability investing?

Al Gore: Be part of the solution and not part of the 
problem. Your employees, your colleagues, your 
board, your investors, your customers are all soon 
going to place a much higher value—and the 
markets will soon place a much higher value—on an 
assessment of how much you are a part of the 
solution to these issues.

How climate change could 
affect corporate valuations

Efforts to reduce climate change can profoundly affect the valuations of 
many companies, but executives so far seem largely unaware.

by Marcel W. Brinkman, Nick Hoffman, and Jeremy M. Oppenheim

To gauge, even at this early stage, the stress that 
climate change will place on the cash flows of large 
public companies, we assessed the impact of a 
series of carbon mitigation scenarios on benchmark 
companies in six sectors.1 The change in cash flows—
compared with a business-as-usual scenario,  
but without explicitly considering the responses of 
individual companies over time—indicates how 
much pressure efforts to reduce carbon emissions 
will exert on valuations and how much volatility a 
sector’s current business systems will face. Such an 
analysis cannot, however, predict the actual impact 
on cash flows, valuations, or share prices.

Not surprising, we found that carbon-abatement 
efforts will put dramatically different levels of stress 
on the cash flows and valuations of different 
industries. The level of change for individual public 
companies within a given sector could of course 
substantially exceed the average, depending on 
their current position and their ability to respond to 
new technologies, changes in consumer behavior, 
and regulation.

Varying levels of stress
We assessed company cash flows in each industry in 
three scenarios: a business-as-usual scenario, a

As global warming spawns new regulations, 
technological remedies, and shifts in consumer 
behavior, its effect on the valuations of many 
sectors and companies is likely to be profound. The 
shocks to some industries could be severe—
potentially as severe as, for example, the effect of 
the introduction of wireless telephony on the 
telecommunications sector during the 1990s and  
of shifting oil prices on the oil and gas sector 
during the 1970s and 1980s. Yet executives have 
so far paid scant attention, either because they 
don’t understand the effects of climate change on 
their businesses or they believe them to be too 
uncertain or distant to model.

1   The six sectors are aluminum, automotive, beer, construction, consumer electronics, and oil and gas. We tested their sensitivity to three levers  
for reducing emissions (regulatory moves, technological shocks, and shifts in consumer demand) and analyzed the potential impact of climate 
change events on the cash flows and 2008 net present value (NPV) of an archetype company in each sector under different climate change 
scenarios and assuming different climate change drivers and levels of impact. The events that might take place in these companies and sectors 
were examined in the short term (2008–11), the medium term (2011–16), and the longer term (2016 onward) in the context of their carbon  
intensity, geographic footprint, and ability to pass through costs and to redeploy capital.

scenario involving the greatest degree of change 
executives can now imagine (the executive scenario), 
and a scenario that many scientists believe would  
be required to stave off a high likelihood of cata-
strophic climate change–related events (the experts’ 
scenario). We chose a basket of six industries  
to under stand how the impact could vary. In some 
indus tries, the mitigation of climate change will 
become a significant corporate-investment theme, 
either creating fundamental shifts in demand or 
leading to new competitive dynamics and business 
models. In others, cash flows will be less stressed  
as short-term cost pressures are passed through to 
customers, thus allowing profit margins to revert  
to average levels in the longer run. The nature of  
the impact will depend on whether an industry shows 
underlying structural resilience or experiences 
funda mental shifts in demand or significantly 
changed competitive dynamics.

beyond) as the economy shifts toward cleaner 
sources of energy (including solar, wind, and carbon 
capture and storage), and as oil-consuming sectors 
(such as automotive and power generation) increase 
their emphasis on energy efficiency. Upstream 
companies could experience falling production and 
sales volumes by 2015, with a substantial impact  
on cash flows. If that happened, valuations would fall 
by around 5 percent in the executive scenario  
and by around 15 percent in the experts’ scenario. 
The potential impact on value is relatively low 
because of the short-term nature of the valuations  
of upstream companies—which mostly reflect  
their current high-yielding discovered and developed 
reserves. These have an average lifespan of 10 to  
15 years and will be largely depleted by the end of 
the next decade. The value of the cash flows 
affected could fall further if a dramatic decline in 
demand pushed down prices.

Fundamental demand shifts
In some industries, shifts in demand will have a 
broadly negative impact on company cash flows and 
therefore valuations. Oil and gas consumption, for 
example, would have to decrease by an average of 
around 0.2 percent a year from now until 2030  
to meet emission reduction targets associated with 
success in stabilizing greenhouse gases. The 
upstream oil and gas industry would therefore expe-
rience falling demand over the long term (2016 and 

By contrast, other industries could enjoy consider-
able gains. Companies in the building-materials 
sector—particularly those that do business in places 
where building efficiency is not yet a major issue—
will probably benefit from rising demand for improved 
energy efficiency and insulation products, which will 
increase their cash flows. In developed economies, 
more stringent building standards are already 
creating demand for such offerings, and the same 
thing will happen in developing markets as well. 

The nature of the impact will depend  
on whether an industry shows 
underlying structural resilience or 
experiences fundamental shifts  
in demand or significantly changed 
competitive dynamics.

How climate change could affect corporate valuations

135

Analysts are already calculating the impact on 
demand of existing regulations and factoring  
it into company valuations. As compared with the 
business-as-usual scenario, the valuation of a 
representative building-materials company in the 
developed world increases by 35 percent in the 
executive scenario and by 80 percent in the experts’ 
one. If more stringent regu latory measures do not 
materialize, valuations could fall by 10 to 20 percent 
as a result of possible short-term cost pressures.

Changing competitive dynamics
Efforts to offset climate change will structurally 
transform certain sectors—including automotive and 
aluminum—which will experience more volatile 
returns and increased rates of entry and exit as new 
technologies or regulatory restrictions emerge  
and the competitive landscape changes.2 The way a 
company reacts to changing technologies and 
business systems will determine its performance.

In the automotive sector, novel technologies will 
create new competitive dynamics and transform 
business systems in the next one to five years. Cash 
flows could be affected both positively and nega-
tively. In the short term, tighter emission standards 
will have an impact on the mix of cars sold, helping 
manufacturers with lineups of smaller, more fuel- 
and emission-efficient cars. Such standards will 
affect the margins of both winners and losers  
and thus their cash flows and valuations, which may 
already reflect some potential changes in value.

Changed fuel efficiency and emissions standards, 
combined with high oil prices, will spur the 
introduction of new drivetrain technologies, such as 
electric and hydrogen, which could start to reach 
scale by 2015.3 A number of competing technologies, 
including more efficient internal-combustion 
engines and hybrids, will be introduced, and so will 
vehicles powered by compressed natural gas, 
hydrogen, or electricity. The impact on valuations 
will depend both on which of these proves dominant 

and on the ability of the automotive OEMs to pass 
along the costs of new technologies and parts to 
consumers or to capture value from other segments 
of the value chain.

While the actual impact on industry valuations  
is highly uncertain, it is not unimaginable that its 
discounted value could rise by 10 percent as 
compared with the business-as-usual scenario if  
the electric or hydrogen technologies become 
dominant, in combination with a new and cheaper 
way of generating power, which could let OEMs  
raise margins by charging higher prices. Certain 
types of regulatory interventions, however,  
could raise the industry’s costs, with no concurrent 
price offsets. In that case, the industry’s value  
could fall by as much as 65 percent. Nonetheless, 
well-positioned players with clear leadership in 
technologies and products should always be able  
to outperform their competitors.

In the aluminum industry, carbon reduction efforts 
will affect the cash flows and valuations of primary 
aluminum producers in three ways:

 — Direct effects. Although the aluminum industry 

does not face direct emissions costs at  
present, they may be introduced in the European 
Union under phase III of the EU Emissions 
Trading Scheme. The impact on valuations will 
depend on carbon pricing and the extent to 
which the industry receives free emission 
allowances. Without any subsidies or offsets,  
a carbon price of $55 per metric ton would  
raise production costs by 11 percent.4

 — Indirect effects. Since energy represents more 

than 30 percent of the costs of primary aluminum 
producers, more expensive power from higher 
carbon pricing will put significant pressure on 
margins. Without any subsidies or offsets, for 
example, a carbon price of $55 per metric ton 
would raise production costs by 17 percent.

2  During similar periods of discontinuity in other sectors in the past, levels of entry and exit rose significantly. As the telecom sector moved to 

wireless, for example, only 17 of the top 30 global telecom companies (by market capitalization) in 1997 were still in the top 30 in 2007.

136

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionConsumer electronics represents a large 
and growing portion of residential 
electricity demand. Using technologies 
that exist today, the industry can make 
its products dramatically more efficient 
at low and diminishing costs. 

 — Changing demand. As cars become lighter  

to reduce emissions, demand for aluminum from 
the automotive sector is expected to rise.  
This increase, however, may be offset by lower 
demand from the packaging industry (as  
a result, for instance, of stricter regulation of 
nonreturnable containers) and by a shift  
toward the use of secondary aluminum from 
increased recycling. If carbon emissions  
are strictly limited, demand for primary aluminum 
may fall dramatically as less-energy-intensive 
materials replace it.

Regional regulatory differences and the access  
of companies in some areas to cheaper power will 
make margins in the primary-aluminum industry 
more volatile, creating both winners and losers. In 
the short to medium term, efforts to reduce carbon 
emissions will probably exacerbate the margin 
differentials between players with facilities in Asia, 
the Middle East, and North Africa, on the one hand, 
and in Europe (and potentially North America),  
on the other. Take, for example, a company with only 
coal-powered European production facilities. If 
carbon prices increase from $25 to $55 per metric 
ton, but the price of aluminum doesn’t increase to 
cover them, the company’s EBITDA5 margins would 
fall to 7 percent from 19 percent.

In the long term, however, the short- to medium-
term advantage enjoyed by aluminum producers in 
lower-cost regions like China, the Middle East,  

and North Africa will probably fall: the global 
standardization of carbon costs will erode  
margin differentials.

Structural resilience
Some sectors will experience minimal long-term 
stress from carbon-abatement efforts: they will be 
able to pass along any short-term cost pressures  
to customers and will not face substitution by other 
products or significant shifts in demand. In such 
cases, profit margins would revert to average levels 
over the medium to long term. The consumer 
electronics industry, for example, will probably have 
the technology to deal with regulation in a way that 
will not harm the bottom line.

Consumer electronics represents a large and 
growing portion of residential electricity demand. 
Using technologies that exist today, the industry  
can make its products dramatically more efficient at 
low and diminishing costs. We expect increased 
efficiency-improvement pressures, including limits 
on standby and active power consumption, as  
well as efficiency-labeling requirements. The overall 
impact on the value of the industry will in our  
view be limited. Some of its revenue and margin 
opportunities could have a positive impact of  
up to 10 percent on its discounted cash flows in the 
executive scenario, or up to 35 percent in the 
experts’ one. Higher costs that could reduce the 
industry’s value by 7 percent could, however,  
offset these opportunities.

How climate change could affect corporate valuations

137

The value of preparation
Much uncertainty remains over the course of 
regulation and the pace of change for the other 
climate change–related forces, such as technology, 
that will influence abatement levels. The value of 
companies is likely to change as these factors start 
to affect their performance. The immediate impact 
on cash flows (and therefore discounted valuations)  
might be limited, but it will eventually be significant 
in some industries.

As nations and companies start acting more 
aggressively to reduce carbon emissions, major shifts 
in the valuations of sectors and companies will  
start to become clearer and more predictable. Over 
the next 18 to 24 months, a number of regulatory  
and policy events, such as the December 2009 
Copenhagen conference to replace the Kyoto treaty, 
will probably reduce the uncertainty and spark a 
rethinking of how carbon reduction efforts will affect 
valuations across a wide range of industries.

Several steps can help companies and their 
executives as they start to position themselves to 
thrive in a low-carbon economy.

Assess the impact of abatement efforts
A critical first step is reviewing a company’s exposure 
to regulatory measures (such as carbon pricing,  
new standards, taxes, and subsidies), new technology, 
and changes in consumer behavior. In our experience, 

the strategy mind-set required for this analysis 
doesn’t come naturally to most executives. They will 
have to ask themselves, for example, how specific 
changes would affect a company’s competitive 
position if other companies adopted new business 
models or how a company can gain a competitive 
edge by moving more quickly.

Strengthen regulatory capabilities
Companies should ensure that they have a consistent 
strategy, informed by analysis, to participate in 
regulatory-policy discussions and to engage with 
policy makers effectively and coherently across 
business units. The best companies will bring public 
and private stakeholders together to shape the 
regulatory environment—both policy principles and 
specific regulations—so that socially efficient 
solutions are also economically attractive.

Build capabilities to deal with uncertainty
The type of analysis we have conducted only 
scratches the surface of what is possible. 
Sophisticated scenario-planning techniques can 
give managers an overall view of how the 
economy—and their markets, in particular—might 
evolve under different climate change outcomes. 
Many companies will succeed in managing the  
major transformations their sectors face only if  
they invest in generating more sophisticated 
forecasts and deeper insights into climate change–
related developments.

future, the way climate change–related events could 
affect its specific cash flows, and what differentiates 
it from its competitors in these respects.

So far, companies have had limited success in 
commu nicating their climate change–related 
activities, often because these moves form only a 
small part of a larger portfolio. In 2008, for  
example, the Spanish power generator Iberdrola 
spun off part of its renewables division—among 
other reasons, to access greater value. BP has looked 
for ways to realize the value of its alternative- 
energy investments, proposing a partial flotation. 
However, very few public compa nies have 
succeeded in explaining the more deeply hidden 
effects of climate change on their cash flows  
and competitive strategies.

Adjust investment review processes
In accordance with the realities of climate change, 
decisions about new corporate investments should 
be geared toward carbon- and energy-efficient 
technologies that will remain competitive over 
investment life cycles. As part of a portfolio of options, 
companies may find it necessary to make bets (in 
new technologies, for example) that are specifically 
related to climate change.

Develop new external links
Venture capital firms, universities, and scientists are 
logical starting points in efforts to build external 
networks that can help companies understand and 
manage the impact of climate change. In the hope  
of developing new solutions, some companies in the 
electric-car segment, for instance, are creating 
consortia that include power companies, suppliers of 
high-tech car batteries, and local governments.

Review investor relations
Companies will need to focus on how and when to 
signal the value of their climate change bets so that 
investors can assess them. Each company will have

CFOs and the  
evolving finance  
function

Forty days after the end of a year’s first three 
fiscal quarters, and 60 days after end of the fiscal 
year, the principal financial officer, or the chief 
accounting officer, of large US public companies 
must submit their signature to the company’s 
financial reports. The US Office of Management 
and Budget estimates an average of 185.08 
burden hours per response for quarterly reports 
and about 2,300 hours for annual ones. Similar 
reporting requirements, some of which are more 
exacting, are in place around the globe.

There’s no doubt reporting is a critical element  
of an effective finance function, and it’s a skill 
that every CFO must perfect. But distinctive  
CFOs don’t solve for accounting, much less quarterly 
accounting. They solve for long-term value creation. 
They discern the company’s unique value proposition, 
which is always relative to peers and potential 
disruptors. They partner with the CEO and the board 
to allocate resources toward value-maximizing 
projects within and across businesses over different 
time horizons. 

CFOs understand their company’s businesses as a 
complete portfolio and have an informed perspective 
on how those businesses could be grown, developed, 
or pared—both organically and by acquisitions, 
divestitures, and alliances. They are on top of their 
company’s most important performance indicators 
and recognize how those can vary among businesses. 
They are deep in the details of the company’s sources 
of risk and opportunity—and can communicate all 
these elements to investors (who are often a highly 
heterogeneous group). 

CFOs do all this and manage the finance function. 
Doing so demands that they build a practice that  
is already ahead of the curve on data and analytics; 
bots have made “bean counting” a thing of the 
past. CFOs must also provide personal support and 
inspiration for their immediate and larger teams. 
They are leaders, regularly the de facto vice CEO, 
ideally the CEO’s confidante and sounding partner, 
and often future CEOs themselves. They also have 
their own learning needs and far-ranging interests 
that are both professional and personal.

It adds up to a lot more than 185.08 hours  
per quarter.

Profiling the modern CFO: 
A panel discussion

Seasoned finance chiefs explore revamping business models and coping 
with new competitors, currency risks, and changing capital structures.

Nik Jhangiani: A business never gets to the point 
where it has the ideal model. The world is changing so 
fast around us. Even in a business that you think is 
stable and predictable, the operating model needs to 
continue to evolve, just given what technology is 
doing. At Coca-Cola Enterprises, we don’t conclude, 
at a single point in time, that the business model 
needs to change—that’s something we challenge 
ourselves on through our long-range-planning 
process every year. 

For example, we have probably the largest sales 
force in Europe of any packaged-goods company, 
and I almost have to challenge that. Is it really 
bringing us the value today that it did five years ago? 
How many people want a salesperson calling on 
their stores or outlets helping them to place an order 
and to merchandise when so much more can 
happen through call centers and technology? You 
definitely don’t want to lose the human touch and 
the relationships, but you do want to allow your sales 
force to be more efficient, effective, and focused on 
what the customers view as an added value.

This is something you, as CFO, need to challenge 
almost every day—to ask if your company’s business 
model is fit for purpose today and, more important,  
if it is fit for purpose for the future. What do we need 
to change, without suddenly having to make a 
wholesale change tomorrow? It needs to be 
constantly adapted.

At McKinsey’s annual Chief Financial Officer 
Forum, in London this June, CFO and chief operating 
officer Samih Elhage of Nokia Networks, Manik 
(“Nik”) Jhangiani of Coca-Cola Enterprises, and 
former Alstom CFO Nicolas Tissot took up some of 
the challenges facing today’s finance chiefs.  
Over the course of an hour, the panelists explored 
the pricing threat posed by a new breed of low-cost 
competitors now rising in emerging markets, the 
risks from the resurgent volatility of currency markets, 
and the brave new world of cheap debt financing 
and its implications for capital structures. 

The discussion, moderated by Financial Times Lex 
column editor Robert Armstrong, shapes a profile of 
the skills and tactics that define the modern CFO. 
The edited highlights below begin with the question 
of whether CFOs should make challenging the 
existing business model part of their role. 

142

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Edition 
 
 
 
 
Robert Armstrong: When you realize that a major 
change has to be made, how do you deal with your 
executive board? 

Nicolas Tissot: Among the members of executive 
committees, CFOs are probably best positioned to 
challenge the businesses. They are independent 
from operations. And they are the only ones, apart 
from the CEO, who have a comprehensive vision  
of the company. The role of a CFO who goes beyond 
being a bean counter is clearly not only to be a 
business partner but also to be a business challenger. 
This is not the easiest part of the job, but it is 
definitely a part of the modern CFO role.

Samih Elhage: In a fast-moving industry like 
Nokia’s, technology life cycles are becoming much 
shorter. In our case, the transformational aspect  
of the business is becoming a way of life. We can’t 
say, definitively, that this is really my process; this  
is my business; this is how I sell; this is how I buy. We 
can say that we’re in a continuous-improvement 
process—and the process itself has to evolve. 

This isn’t about squeezing the budget to reduce 
costs. It’s about significantly changing the company’s 
processes and mode of operation. In many cases, 

you have to change the way you sell certain products 
and the way you charge particular customers.  
And, in some cases, you have to exit specific areas  
of the business. When I first came to Nokia, we were 
operating in ten different segments. Since then, 
we’ve made incisive and, I think, courageous changes, 
divesting eight of these businesses to focus 
intensely on the two that would give us the operating 
performance we were looking for. 

Competitive dynamics and pricing 

Robert Armstrong: Let’s talk a little about 
competitive dynamics. Samih, you are in a unique 
position there. How do you manage the company 
when you are constantly under pressure from large, 
low-cost emerging-market competitors?

Samih Elhage: Well, competition is undeniably an 
important element in our day-to-day operations 
because of its implications for our cost structure and 
for pricing. But we resist being driven reactively by 
the actions of competitors. We have a strong pricing 
strategy and controls to ensure that prices are  
being set at the right level—one that ensures our 
customers are getting value for money and that

we are able to fund investment in R&D and healthy 
performance for our stakeholders. And, in a 
competitive environment, our cost structure, which 
is extremely lean, gives us the means to fight when 
fighting is what’s required.

actually facing deflation, and customers and 
consumers are looking at that, too. What we’re not 
able to achieve through pricing, we have to do by 
reducing costs—finding better ways to be efficient 
at what we do. 

Robert Armstrong: Let’s explore that pricing theme 
a bit. Nik, how does pricing feed into the finances of 
Coca-Cola Enterprises?

Nik Jhangiani: It is a huge element. Fortunately, in 
the past couple of years, we’ve benefited from the 
more benign commodities environment. As recently 
as four or five years ago, inflation was high, and we 
had to find a way to pass that on to our customers and 
our consumers. Today, some markets in Europe are 

The answer isn’t always about the absolute price  
the market will bear. Sometimes, it’s much more 
about what you can do from an overall revenue-
growth perspective. In addition to cutting costs and 
increasing prices, how do you get the right mix of 
products to generate more transactions? How might 
you change your packaging strategy to increase 
revenue growth? For example, would consumers 
want—and pay a slight premium for—a smaller or 
differentiated or more premium package? 

144

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionNicolas Tissot: In heavy industries, the pricing 
environment is always driven by the business cycle. 
For several years, we’ve been in a crisis that also  
has some structural components. So we’ve had to 
adapt structurally to the emergence of new 
competitors from places with a lower cost base.  
We also need to adjust to the interest of our  
clients in our services, as well as our technology.  
The CFO is instrumental, for example, in launching 
performance and restructuring plans, setting  
up partnerships, allocating R&D money, and 
reorienting manufac turing investment.

On pricing, we need to adapt rapidly or we’ll lose 
every sale. At one time, deals targeted a level  
of profitability that fully rewarded our investments. 
But when there is overcapacity in the market and 
when—to break even—competitors fight to keep 
factories running, sometimes you end up settling for 
the second-best price. At Alstom, the CFO, who 
personally approves every bid above €50 million, has 
to take into account those specific periods and  
relax the margin targets appropriately. 

Foreign-currency risk 

Robert Armstrong: Currency risk has returned to 
the corporate world’s attention over the past year, 
with the strong dollar and the fluctuations of other 
currencies. How do you manage the risks? 

Samih Elhage: I start with how we should achieve 
our performance goals and then ask how we cope 
with the challenges of all external aspects, including 
currency fluctuations. In our business, we depend 
mainly on four currencies—the euro, the US dollar, the 
Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan. We usually  
get our performance plan approved by the board in 
Q4 and make any changes at the beginning of  
the year. From there, I ask teams to develop their 
performance plans reflecting the impact of 
currencies. Their underlying business objectives 
have to be achieved from an operating-profit 
perspective, and that comes down to cash. 

If the effect of currency shifts helps the top  
line, that’s assumed to be in addition to the team’s 
performance goals. If currency shifts affect

compen sating for that. 

Is that challenging? Absolutely. It adds to the pressure 
on teams to meet their goals. Are we making 
progress? Yes, we are. But costs associated with 
hedging have to be included in the accounting 
statements, and they have cash implications. Our 
teams know that they just have to make the  
numbers add up. 

Nik Jhangiani: The countries in which Coca-Cola 
Enterprises operates give us a fairly natural hedge—
because our revenues and a great deal of our cost 
base are local. In fact, we produce 90-plus percent 
of our products within a given market. It’s difficult 
and expensive to transport water. Producing locally 
gives us another natural hedge. 

The issue is more with our commodity exposures, 
which could be in different currencies. That’s where 
we make sure that we’re covering risk through 
transaction exposures, for which we hold teams 
accountable—having hedging policies in place  
and ensuring that all our transaction exposures are 
covered, at least on a rolling 12-month basis (with 
lower levels of coverage going out 36 months). 
Teams are responsible for making sure that currency 
risks are covered through pricing and cost 
structures and so on.

Our hedging strategy is very clear. We’re not looking 
to beat the market. We are just trying to increase 
certainty around our cost structure. We do not hedge 
for translational currency conversion or exposure. 
When we communicate with the market, we actually 
give guidance and provide our performance data 
both on a currency-neutral basis and then with the 
impact of currencies. The transaction part is built 
into the information we provide. 

You can’t keep changing what you do in volatile times, 
as that volatility will always be out there. At times, 
translation or currency conversion works and has 
some benefits, and at times it doesn’t. You have to  
try to ride through that cycle without being reactive 
and changing things, unless you see something  
that isn’t working over the long term.

Nicolas Tissot: We see our business as being  
a supplier of industrial equipment and associated 
services, not playing games with the fluctuations  
of currencies. As soon as an order is firmed up, we 
have a full analysis of the currency flows. Then  
that exposure is systematically hedged over  
the horizon available in the market, with a rolling  
foreign-exchange strategy. We have pretty 
significant activity in that respect. To avoid paying  
too much in fees to the banks, we use an electronic 
platform. The banks own the platform, and it is 
competitive for any foreign-exchange trade that we 
handle to hedge our exposure.

Capital structure 

Robert Armstrong: One of the ironic consequences 
of the financial crisis is that debt financing is  
cheap and easy to get unless you’re a bank. It’s so 
cheap, why have any equity at all? How do you make 
capital-structure decisions in this context?

Nicolas Tissot: Regarding debt financing, over the 
past few years there have been times when we’ve 
needed to think fast, act fast, and be opportunistic. 
There are imperfections in the market, and many  
of us have seized the opportunities they create. But 
at the same time, you always have to keep the long-
term view in mind. 

Alstom is in a very cyclical industry, and sometimes 
you can lose sight of your position in the cycle. When 
things are good, there’s a risk of leveraging too 
much; when the hard times come back, you burn a 
lot of cash and quickly deteriorate your financial 
structure and therefore your rating, which leaves you 
little if no access to debt markets. We manage our 
financial structure—the structure of the balance 
sheet—with that in mind. At the peak of the cycle, we 
want to have almost no leverage, while at the trough 
we accept more. 

Samih Elhage: At Nokia, our capital-structure 
decisions are guided by the principle that we should 
always do our best to give back to shareholders.  
In the past two years, as we purchased Siemens’s 
share of Nokia Siemens Networks and sold  

146

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionthe device business to Microsoft, we put in place  
a program to improve our capital structure and to 
return €5 billion to shareholders over three years.

Why have equity at all? Our philosophy is that there 
should be a balance. You should go to the market 
when you must, but you also need a very strong 
capital structure to defend the business and to drive 
the right investment at the right time.

Nik Jhangiani: We sold the US business back to  
the Coca-Cola Company in 2010 and formed the  
new Coca-Cola Enterprises. That included much of 
the debt we had, as well. We continue to generate  
a great deal of free cash flow, but at the same time 
we also realized that we were very underleveraged  
and didn’t have the most efficient balance sheet. So 
we set a leverage target of two and a half to three 
times net debt to EBITDA, compared with where we 

were before the sale, which was closer to one to one 
and a half times net debt to EBITDA. It could have 
been lower, but we picked a level that we saw as the 
right starting point for the journey we wanted to 
make. We would slowly lever up toward that level,  
so this wasn’t a big one-shot bang, and we  
wanted to make sure we had enough dry powder  
for potential activities. 

The leveraging up, along with the free cash flow that 
we continue to generate and a strong focus on  
that cash-conversion rate, gives us a solid pool of 
free cash flow. In the absence of M&A, the best  
way to use it was to return it to shareholders. Over 
the last four years, from the formation of the  
new Coca-Cola Enterprises through the end of  
2014, we have returned approximately $8 billion  
to shareholders.

Starting up as CFO

There are a few critical tasks that all finance chiefs must tackle in their first 
hundred days.

by Bertil E. Chappuis, Aimee Kim, and Paul J. Roche

To show how it is changing—and how to work through 
the evolving expectations—we surveyed 164 CFOs of 
many different tenures2 and interviewed 20 of  
them. From these sources, as well as our years of 
experience working with experienced CFOs, we 
have distilled lessons that shed light on what it takes 
to succeed. We emphasize the initial transition 
period: the first three to six months.

Early priorities
Newly appointed CFOs are invariably interested, 
often anxiously, in making their mark. Where they 
should focus varies from company to company. In 
some, enterprise-wide strategic and transformational 
initiatives (such as value-based management, 
corporate-center strategy, or portfolio optimization) 
require considerable CFO involvement. In others, 
day-to-day business needs can be more demanding 
and time sensitive—especially in the Sarbanes–
Oxley environment—creating significant distractions 
unless they are carefully managed. When CFOs 
inherit an organization under stress, they may have 
no choice but to lead a turnaround, which  
requires large amounts of time to cut costs and 
reassure investors.

Yet some activities should make almost every CFO’s 
short list of priorities. Getting them defined in a 
company-specific way is a critical step in balancing 
efforts to achieve technical excellence in the finance 
function with strategic initiatives to create value.

In recent years, CFOs have assumed increasingly 
complex, strategic roles focused on driving the 
creation of value across the entire business. Growing 
shareholder expectations and activism, more 
intense M&A, mounting regulatory scrutiny over 
corporate conduct and compliance, and evolving 
expectations for the finance function have put  
CFOs in the middle of many corporate decisions—
and made them more directly accountable for  
the performance of companies.

Not only is the job more complicated, but a lot of 
CFOs are new at it—turnover in 2006 for Fortune 
500 companies was estimated at 13 percent.1 
Compounding the pressures, companies are also 
more likely to reach outside the organization to 
recruit new CFOs, who may therefore have to learn  
a new industry as well as a new role.

1   Financial officers’ turnover, Russel Reynolds Associates, 2007. 
2  We surveyed 164 current or former CFOs across industries, geographies, revenue categories, and ownership structures. For more of our 

conclusions, see “The CFO’s first hundred days: A McKinsey Global Survey,” McKinsey Quarterly, December 2007.

148

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Edition 
 
Conduct a value creation audit
The most critical activity during a CFO’s first hundred 
days, according to more than 55 percent of our survey 
respondents, is understanding what drives their 
company’s business. These drivers include the way a 
company makes money, its margin advan tage, its 
returns on invested capital (ROIC), and the reasons 
for them. At the same time, the CFO must also 
consider potential ways to improve these drivers, 
such as sources of growth, operational improvements, 
and changes in the business model, as well as and 
how much the company might gain from all of them. 
To develop that understanding, several CFOs we 
interviewed conducted a strategy and value audit 
soon after assuming the position. They evaluated 
their companies from an investor’s perspective to 
understand how the capital markets would value the 
relative impact of revenue versus higher margins  
or capital efficiency and assessed whether efforts 
to adjust prices, cut costs, and the like would create 
value, and if so how much.

Although this kind of effort would clearly be a priority 
for external hires, it can also be useful for internal 

ones. As a CFO promoted internally at one high- 
tech company explained, “When I was the CFO of a 
business unit, I never worried about corporate 
taxation. I never thought about portfolio-level risk 
exposure in terms of products and geographies. 
When I became corporate CFO, I had to learn  
about business drivers that are less important to 
individual business unit performance.”

The choice of information sources for getting up to 
speed on business drivers can vary. As CFOs 
conducted their value audit, they typically started by 
mastering existing information, usually by meeting 
with business unit heads, who not only shared  
the specifics of product lines or markets but are also 
important because they use the finance function’s 
services. Indeed, a majority of CFOs in our survey, 
and particularly those in private companies, wished 
that they had spent even more time with this group 
(Exhibit 1). Such meetings allow CFOs to start building 
relationships with these key stakeholders of the 
finance function and to understand their needs. 
Other CFOs look for external perspectives on their 
companies and on the marketplace by talking to

customers, investors, or professional service 
providers. The CFO at one pharma company reported 
spending his first month on the job “riding around with 
a sales rep and meeting up with our key cus tomers. 
It’s amazing how much I actually learned from these 
discussions. This was information that no one  
inside the company could have told me.”

the senior-management team, contribute to the 
company’s performance, and make the finance 
organization efficient (Exhibit 2). When one new 
CFO asked the CEO what he expected at the  
one-year mark, the response was, “When you’re 
able to finish my sentences, you’ll know you’re  
on the right track.”

Lead the leaders
Experienced CFOs not only understand and try  
to drive the CEO’s agenda, but also know they must 
help to shape it. CFOs often begin aligning them-
selves with the CEO and board members well before 
taking office. During the recruiting process, most 
CFOs we interviewed received very explicit guidance 
from them about the issues they considered 
important, as well as where the CFO would have to 
assume a leadership role. Similarly, nearly four- 
fifths of the CFOs in our survey reported that the 
CEO explained what was expected from them—
particularly that they serve as active members of  

Building that kind of alignment is a challenge  
for CFOs, who must have a certain ultimate 
independence as the voice of the shareholder. That 
means they must immediately begin to shape  
the CEO’s agenda around their own focus on value 
creation. Among the CFOs we interviewed, those 
who had conducted a value audit could immediately 
pitch their insights to the CEO and the board—thus 
gaining credibility and starting to shape the dialogue. 
In some cases, facts that surfaced during the 
process enabled CFOs to challenge business unit 
orthodoxies. What’s more, the CFO is in a unique 
position to put numbers against a company’s 

150

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionstrategic options in a way that lends a sharp edge  
to decision making. The CFO at a high-tech 
company, for example, created a plan that identified 
several key issues for the long-term health of the 
business, including how large enterprises could use 
its product more efficiently. This CFO then prodded 
sales and service to develop a new strategy and 
team to drive the product’s adoption.

To play these roles, a CFO must establish trust with 
the board and the CEO, avoiding any appearance of 
conflict with them while challenging their decisions 
and the company’s direction if necessary. Maintaining 
the right balance is an art, not a science. As the CFO 
at a leading software company told us, “It’s important 
to be always aligned with the CEO and also to be 
able to factually call the balls and strikes as you see 
them. When you cannot balance the two, you need 
to find a new role.”

Strengthen the core
To gain the time for agenda-shaping priorities, CFOs 
must have a well-functioning finance function behind 
them; otherwise, they won’t have the credibility and 
hard data to make the difficult arguments. Many new 

CFOs find that disparate IT systems, highly manual 
processes, an unskilled finance staff, or unwieldy 
organizational structures hamper their ability to do 
anything beyond closing the quarter on time. In 
order to strengthen the core team, during the first 
hundred days about three-quarters of the new  
CFOs we surveyed initiated (or developed a plan to 
initiate) fundamental changes in the function’s  
core activities (Exhibit 3).

Several of our CFOs launched a rigorous look at the 
finance organization and operations they had just 
taken over, and many experienced CFOs said they 
wished they had done so. In these reviews, the  
CFOs assessed the reporting structure, evaluated 
the fit and capabilities of the finance executives  
they had inherited, validated the finance organiza-
tion’s cost benchmarks, and identified any gaps in 
the effectiveness or efficiency of key systems, 
processes, and reports. The results of such a review 
can help CFOs gauge how much energy they will 
need to invest in the finance organization during their 
initial six to 12 months in office—and to fix any 
problems they find.

Transitions offer a rare opportunity: the organization 
is usually open to change. More than half of our 
respondents made at least moderate alterations in 
the core finance team early in their tenure. As one 
CFO of a global software company put it, “If there is 
a burning platform, then you need to find it and 
tackle it. If you know you will need to make people 
changes, make them as fast as you can. Waiting  
only gets you into more trouble.”

Manage performance actively
CFOs can play a critical role in enhancing the 
performance dialogue of the corporate center, the 
business units, and corporate functions. They  
have a number of tools at their disposal, including 
dashboards, performance targets, enhanced 
planning processes, the corporate review calendar, 
and even their own relationships with the leaders  
of business units and functions.

Among the CFOs we interviewed, some use these 
tools, as well as facts and insights derived from the 
CFO’s unique access to information about the 
business, to challenge other executives. A number of 
interviewees take a different approach, however, 
exploiting what they call the “rhythm of the business” 
by using the corporate-planning calendar to shape 
the performance dialogue through discussions, their 
own agendas, and metrics. Still other CFOs, we  
have observed, exert influence through their personal 
credibility at performance reviews.

While no consensus emerged from our discussions, 
the more experienced CFOs stressed the 
importance of learning about a company’s current 
performance dialogues early on, understanding 
where its performance must be improved, and 
developing a long-term strategy to influence efforts 
to do so. Such a strategy might use the CFO’s ability 
to engage with other senior executives, as well  
as changed systems and processes that could spur 
performance and create accountability.

would be applicable to any major corporate 
leadership role but are nevertheless highly relevant 
for new CFOs—in particular, those who come  
from functional roles.

Get a mentor
Although a majority of the CFOs we interviewed said 
that their early days on the job were satisfactory,  
the transition wasn’t without specific challenges. A 
common complaint we hear is about the lack of 
mentors—an issue that also came up in our recent 
survey results, which showed that 32 percent  
of the responding CFOs didn’t have one. Forty-six 
percent of the respondents said that the CEO  
had mentored them, but the relationship appeared 
to be quite different from the traditional mentorship 
model, because many CFOs felt uncomfortable 
telling the boss everything about the challenges they 
faced. As one CFO put it during an interview, “being  
a CFO is probably one of the loneliest jobs out there.” 
Many of the CFOs we spoke with mentioned  
the value of having one or two mentors outside the 
company to serve as a sounding board. We also 
know CFOs who have joined high-value roundtables 
and other such forums to build networks and  
share ideas.

Listen first . . . then act
Given the declining average tenure in office of 
corporate leaders, and the high turnover among 
CFOs in particular, finance executives often feel 
pressure to make their mark sooner rather than later. 
This pressure creates a potentially unhealthy bias 
toward acting with incomplete—or, worse, 
inaccurate—information. While we believe strongly 
that CFOs should be aggressive and action  
oriented, they must use their energy and enthusiasm 
effectively. As one CFO reflected in hindsight, “I 
would have spent even more time listening and less 
time doing. People do anticipate change from  
a new CFO, but they also respect you more if you 
take the time to listen and learn and get it right  
when you act.”

First steps
Given the magnitude of what CFOs may be required 
to do, it is no surprise that the first 100 to 200 days 
can be taxing. Yet those who have passed through 
this transition suggest several useful tactics. Some 

Make a few themes your priority—consistently
Supplement your day-to-day activities with no more 
than three to four major change initiatives and  
focus on them consistently. To make change happen,  
you will have to repeat your message over and over—

152

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editioninternally, to the finance staff, and externally, to 
other stakeholders. Communicate your changes by 
stressing broad themes that, over time, could 
encompass newly identified issues and actions. One 
element of your agenda, for example, might be  
the broad theme of improving the efficiency of 
financial operations rather than just the narrow one 
of offshoring.

Invest time up front to gain credibility
Gaining credibility early on is a common challenge—
particularly, according to our survey, for a CFO  
hired from outside a company. In some cases, it’s 
sufficient to invest enough time to know the 
numbers cold, as well as the company’s products, 
markets, and plans. In other cases, gaining 
credibility may force you to adjust your  
mindset fundamentally.

The CFOs we interviewed told us that it’s hard to  
win support and respect from other corporate 
officers without making a conscious effort to think 

like a CFO. Clearly, one with the mentality of a lead 
controller, focused on compliance and control,  
isn’t likely to make the kind of risky but thoughtful 
decisions needed to help a company grow. 
Challenging a business plan and a strategy isn’t 
always about reducing investments and squeezing 
incre mental margins. The CFO has an opportunity  
to apply a finance lens to management’s approach 
and to ensure that a company thoroughly examines  
all possible ways of accelerating and maximizing the 
capture of value.

As an increasing number of executives become new 
CFOs, their ability to understand where value is 
created and to develop a strategy for influencing 
both executives and ongoing performance 
management will shape their future legacies. While 
day-to-day operations can quickly absorb the  
time of any new CFO, continued focus on these 
issues and the underlying quality of the finance 
operation defines world-class CFOs.

Communicating with  
the right investors

Executives spend too much time talking with investors who don’t matter. 
Here’s how to identify those who do.

by Robert N. Palter, Werner Rehm, and Jonathan Shih

the classic approach that investors use to segment 
companies. The expectation is that growth 
investors will pay more, so if a company can persuade 
them to buy its stock, its share price will rise. That 
expectation is false: many growth investors buy after 
an increase in share prices. More important, 
traditional segmen tation approaches reveal little 
about the way investors decide to buy and sell 
shares. How long does an investor typically hold 
onto a position, for example? How concentrated  
is the investor’s portfolio? Which financial and 
operational data are most helpful for the investor? 
We believe that the answers to these and  
similar questions provide better insights for 
classifying investors.

Once a company segments investors along the right 
lines, it can quickly identify those who matter  
most. These important investors, whom we call 
“intrinsic” investors, base their decisions on a  
deep understanding of a company’s strategy, its 
current performance, and its potential to create 
long-term value. They are also more likely than other 
investors to support management through short-
term volatility. Executives who reach out to intrinsic 
investors, leaving others to the investor relations 
department,2 will devote less time to investor relations 
and communicate a clearer, more focused message.

Many executives spend too much time communi-
cat ing with investors they would be better off 
ignoring. CEOs and CFOs, in particular, devote an 
inordinate amount of time to one-on-one meetings 
with investors, investment conferences, and other 
shareholder communications,1 often without having 
a clear picture of which investors really count.

The reason, in part, is that too many companies 
segment investors using traditional methods that 
yield only a shallow understanding of their motives 
and behavior; for example, we repeatedly run across 
investor relations groups that try to position 
investors as growth or value investors—mirroring 

1   Including a wide range of communications activities, such as annual shareholder meetings, conferences with sell-side analysts, quarterly 

earnings calls, and market updates.

2  This article deals only with institutional investors, since management usually spends the most time with them. We also exclude activist investors 

because they represent a different investor relations issue for management.

154

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Edition 
 
The result should be a better alignment between a 
company’s intrinsic value and its market value, one 
of the core goals of investor relations.3

A better segmentation
No executive would talk to important customers 
without understanding how they make purchase 
decisions, yet many routinely talk to investors without 
understanding their investment criteria. Our analysis 
of typical holding periods, investment portfolio 
concentrations, the number of professionals involved 
in decisions, and average trading volumes—as  
well as the level of detail investors require when they 
undertake research on a company—suggests  
that investors can be distributed among three  
broad categories.

Intrinsic investors
Intrinsic investors take a position in a company only 
after rigorous due diligence of its intrinsic ability  
to create long-term value. This scrutiny typically 
takes more than a month. We estimate that these 
investors hold 20 percent of US assets and 
contribute 10 percent of the trading volume in the 
US market.

In interviews with more than 20 intrinsic investors, 
we found that they have concentrated portfolios—
each position, on average, makes up 2 to 3 percent 
of their portfolios and perhaps as much as 10 percent; 
the average position of other investors is less than  
1 percent. Intrinsic investors also hold few positions 
per analyst (from four to ten companies) and hold 
shares for several years. Once they have invested, 
these professionals support the current management 
and strategy through short-term volatility. In view  
of all the effort intrinsic investors expend, executives 
can expect to have their full attention while reaching 
out to them, for they take the time to listen, to 
analyze, and to ask insightful questions.

These investors also have a large impact on the way 
a company’s intrinsic value lines up with its market 
value—an effect that occurs mechanically because 
when they trade, they trade in high volumes (exhibit). 
They also have a psychological effect on the market 
because their reputation for very well-timed trades 
magnifies their influence on other investors. One 
indication of their influence: there are entire 
websites (such as GuruFocus.com, Stockpickr.com,  
and Mffais.com) that follow the portfolios of well-
known intrinsic investors.

3  If this goal sounds counterintuitive, consider the alternatives. Clearly, undervaluation isn’t desirable. An overvaluation is going to be corrected 
sooner or later, and the correction will, among other things, distress board members and employees with worthless stock options issued when 
the shares were overvalued.

Communicating with the right investors

155

Mechanical investors
Mechanical investors, including computer-run index 
funds and investors who use computer models to 
drive their trades, make decisions based on strict 
criteria or rules. We also include in this category the 
so-called closet index funds. These are large 
institutional investors whose portfolios resemble 
those of an index fund because of their size, even 
though they don’t position themselves in that way.4

We estimate that around 32 percent of the total equity 
in the United States sits in purely mechanical 
investment funds of all kinds. Because their approach 
offers no real room for qualitative decision criteria, 
such as the strength of a management team or a 
strategy, investor relations can’t influence them to 
include a company’s shares in an index fund. 
Similarly, these investors’ quantitative criteria, such 
as buying stocks with low price-to-equity ratios  
or the shares of companies below a certain size, are 
based on mathematical models of greater or lesser 
sophistication, not on insights about fundamental 
strategy and value creation.

In the case of closet index funds, each investment 
professional handles, on average, 100 to 150 posi-
tions, making it impossible to do in-depth research 
that could be influenced by meetings with an 
investment target’s management. In part, the high 
number of positions per professional reflects  
the fact that most closet index funds are part of 
larger investment houses that separate the roles of 
fund manager and researcher. The managers of 
intrinsic investors, by contrast, know every company 
in their portfolios in depth.

Traders
The investment professionals in the trader group 
seek short-term financial gain by betting on news 
items, such as the possibility that a company’s 
quarterly earnings per share (EPS) will be above or 
below the consensus view or, in the case of a drug 
maker, recent reports that a clinical trial has gone 
badly. Traders control about 35 percent of US equity 
holdings. Such investors don’t really want to 
understand companies on a deep level—they just 

seek better information for making trades. Not that 
traders don’t understand companies or industries; 
on the contrary, these investors follow the news about 
them closely and often approach companies  
directly, seeking nuances or insights that could 
matter greatly in the short term. The average 
investment professional in this segment has 20 or 
more positions to follow, however, and trades in  
and out of them quickly to capture small gains over 
short periods—as short as a few days or even  
hours. Executives therefore have no reason to 
spend time with traders.

Focused communications
Most investor relations departments could create the 
kind of segmentation we describe. They should  
also consider several additional layers of information, 
such as whether an investor does (or plans to)  
hold shares in a company or has already invested 
elsewhere in its sector. A thorough segmentation 
that identifies sophisticated intrinsic investors will 
allow companies to manage their investor relations 
more successfully.

Don’t oversimplify your message
Intrinsic investors have spent considerable effort to 
understand your business, so don’t boil down a 
discussion of strategy and performance to a ten-
second sound bite for the press or traders. 
Management should also be open about the relevant 
details of the company’s current performance and 
how it relates to strategy. Says one portfolio manager, 
“I don’t want inside information. But I do want 
management to look me in the eye when they talk 
about their performance. If they avoid a discussion or 
explanation, we will not invest, no matter how 
attractive the numbers look.”

Interpret feedback in the right context
Most companies agree that it is useful to understand 
the views of investors while developing strategies 
and investor communications. Yet management 
often relies on simple summaries of interviews with 
investors and sell-side analysts about everything 
from strategy to quarterly earnings to share 

4  For more on closet index funds, see Martijn Cremers and Antti Petajisto, How active is your fund manager? A new measure that predicts 

performance, American Finance Association meetings, Chicago, IL, January 15, 2007.

156

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionrepurchases. This approach gives management  
no way of linking the views of investors to their 
importance for the company or to their investment 
strategies. A segmented approach, which  
clarifies each investor’s goals and needs, lets  
executives interpret feedback in context and  
weigh messages accordingly.

Prioritize management’s time
A CEO or CFO should devote time to communicating 
only with the most important and knowledgeable 
intrinsic investors that have professionals specializing 
in the company’s sector. Moreover, a CEO should 
think twice before attending conferences if equity 
analysts have arranged the guest lists, unless 
management regards those guests as intrinsic 
investors. When a company focuses its 
communications on them, it may well have more 
impact in a shorter amount of time.

In our experience, intrinsic investors think that  
exec utives should spend no more than about  
10 percent of their time on investor-related activities, 

so management should be actively engaging with  
15 to 20 investors at most. The investor relations 
department ought to identify the most important 
ones, review the list regularly, and protect 
management from the telephone calls of analysts 
and mechanical investors, who are not a high  
priority. Executives should talk to equity analysts 
only if their reports are important channels for 
interpreting complicated news; otherwise, investor 
relations can give them any relevant data they  
require, if available.

Marketing executives routinely segment customers 
by the decision processes those customers use  
and tailor the corporate image and ad campaigns  
to the most important ones. Companies could 
benefit from a similar kind of analytic rigor in their 
investor relations.

The CFO’s role in 
capability building 

Organizations developing new skills for the next normal must determine 
exactly how and where to invest in them. The finance leader is uniquely 
suited to provide the necessary combination of insights.

by Rawi Abdelal, Kevin Carmody, Meagan Hill, and William J. Pearson

and demands of customers and investors in ways 
that haven’t totally revealed them selves yet. And all 
this is happening as the world of work continues  
to change rapidly. It would be a lot for C-suite 
leaders—including the CFO—to navigate, even in  
the best of times. 

However, many CFOs are likely to say that their 
experience with capability building has been both 
underdeveloped and underutilized. Over the  
past decade, the CFO’s role—and that of the overall 
finance function—has expanded so that it now 
affects more parts of the organization directly. More 
functions now report to CFOs, who now have more 
oversight of tasks that traditionally hadn’t been part 
of their mandate. In a 2018 McKinsey survey, four  
in ten CFOs said they created the most value for their 
organizations through their strategic leadership  
and performance management. But less than half of 
the CFOs surveyed reported having the time to  
focus on capability building, either within the finance 
function or across the organization.2

It’s critical for companies to give CFOs enough space 
to play this role in capability building. They are 
uniquely positioned not only to ensure that business 
units get the resources they need to invest in the 
infrastructure, technology, talent, and organizational 
changes required to thrive in the next normal but

It’s becoming increasingly clear that some of  
the most critical responsibilities of CFOs in coming 
months will be supporting efforts to build new 
capabilities—the mindsets and behavior an organi-
zation needs to reach and sustain its full potential—
and raising the bar on talent development.

A focus on capability building is especially relevant 
now as businesses attempt to rebound from the 
health and economic effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic.1 The pandemic has accelerated the use of 
automation, artificial intelligence, and other digital 
technologies to enhance or streamline processes. It 
has affected the management of supply chains and 
business partnerships. It has changed the priorities

158

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Edition 
 
also to model critical cross-functional behavior  
and skill sets. 

Other denizens of the C-suite are only now catching 
on to the CFO’s growing and varied responsibilities 
and emerging profile as financial controller, value 
manager, and strategic partner. In this article, we look 
at the primary ways CFOs can help companies build 
capabilities to prepare for the future—as well as  
the skills and mindsets that finance chiefs may need 
to ensure that their recommendations are heard. 

Capabilities: How the CFO can help  
the organization
As organizations shift from responding to the 
COVID-19 pandemic to recovering from it, many are 
discovering that the capabilities of the workforce no 
longer match the needs of the marketplace.3 Grocers, 
restaurants, and retailers that quickly shifted  
to online ordering and sales during the crisis, for 
example, have had to rethink their systems, 
processes, and supply chains and, in many cases,  
had to incorporate new technical capabilities and 
skill sets. But at a time when executives need to 
double down on capability building, they are finding 
that their efforts are falling short. In a 2020 
McKinsey survey, for instance, just one-third of the 
respondents reported that capability-building 

programs often or always achieve their objectives 
and business impact.4 To improve the odds of 
success, companies should leverage the CFO’s 
expertise in three critical ways: identifying 
opportunities to invest in capabilities that can create 
significant value, boosting financial acumen at all 
levels, and supporting the company’s overall talent-
development efforts.

Identify opportunities to invest in  
value-creating capabilities
Capability building and financial performance  
are inextricably linked—having the right people with 
the right skills in the right places can promote 
operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and 
other elements that feed sales, revenues, profits, 
and many other measures of performance. The good 
news is that CFOs have most of the required 
financial and operational data, as well as a cross-
functional understanding of the business, in  
hand. They can therefore help companies identify 
the capabilities that can differentiate them  
from competitors. 

One stumbling block for the CEO and other C-suite 
leaders, however, is the idea that investments in 
capability building must show immediate payoffs. In 
reality, most of the value from human-capital 
investments accrues over time. As U.S. Bank’s Tim 

One stumbling block for C-suite  
leaders is the idea that investments  
in capability building must show 
immediate payoffs. In reality, most  
of the value accrues over time.

The CFO’s role in capability building 

159

Welsh has noted, “Capability building never ends.  
It’s an ongoing task. So you have to look for markers 
along the way that make you feel comfortable you’re 
moving in the right direction.” Those markers of 
success might include an increase in the number and 
quality of customer engagements and higher 
employee-satisfaction scores. “The likelihood is  
that these markers will point to more tangible 
measures: sales, deposit growth, loan-balance 
growth,” said Welsh.5

Indeed, one of the biggest mistakes we’ve seen 
companies make in capability building is a failure to 
link learning and other development efforts  
directly to performance improvements. The CFO 
must guide other C-suite leaders through the  
long- and short-term trade-offs associated with 
investing in capability building and help them  
define the means and metrics to monitor progress 
toward stated performance goals.6 The CFO at  
one food manufacturer, for instance, has assigned 
financial analysts to work directly with the 
operations team to collect and interpret real-time 
data on consumer preferences. The CFO uses  
the data and cross-functional relationships to help 
C-suite leaders track the need (and build the 
business cases) for skills and capabilities in specific 
areas of the business: as online sales increase,  
more investments may be required for user-
experience designers, supply-chain specialists,  
or other kinds of experts. 

Boost the organization’s financial acumen
Employees across an organization often use the 
same terms to mean different things. “Profit,” for 
example, can refer to profit dollars, profit per  
unit, profit margins, or even gross margin; “costs” 
can mean overhead, marketing investments,  
or even capital. To reduce confusion and increase  
efficiency in both operations and communications, 
CFOs must ensure that leaders up and down  
the organization use a common language to discuss 
finance. In this way, the CFO can build core 
functional capabilities for monitoring cash flows, 
establishing base and momentum cases, and  

using a range of scenarios in decision making, which 
are all critical to understanding how an organization  
can unlock more value. 

At one consumer-goods company, the CFO became 
concerned enough about the general lack of 
business acumen outside the finance group to 
design an internal mini-MBA program and 
curriculum for high performers. This program aimed 
to help business-unit leaders better understand 
their divisions’ roles within the global organization, 
the function’s value-creating role within the 
division, the importance of the individual roles of the 
business-unit leaders, and how key performance 
indicators were wired into the company’s operating 
model and strategic plan. The business-unit leaders 
also learned how the company made resource-
reallocation decisions, what trade-offs might be 
required, and how they themselves could contribute 
to the company’s success. 

After the first sessions ended, the CFO noted 
instances when teams “really seemed to get it.” Some, 
for instance, accepted fewer resources in the  
short term so that resources could be applied to 
other initiatives, which the business-unit leaders 
now understood to be more important for the 
company over the long term—with the benefits 
ultimately redounding to their own units over  
time. The CFO also organized frequent town halls 
and presentations about the organization’s  
strategy so all functions could understand how  
the business model worked and their role in it.  
In this way, the CFO celebrated wins and reinforced 
the kind of behavior that drives success. 

Now—and, frankly, always—it’s critical for the CFO 
and CEO to work together to empower business-unit 
leaders and other employees to take ownership of 
cash-related decisions.7 Particularly in the wake of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, cash preservation  
remains a critical concern for most organizations. 
How are they managing receivables, payables,  
and inventory? Are they wringing the most value 
from the balance sheet? Are operating and

behavior, they can also help C-suite 
leaders think about strategic imperatives 
as a cohesive whole.

capital expenditures under control? To build and 
reinforce a cash culture, the CFO can help  
highlight the executives and teams tackling these 
questions and managing cash well—for instance, 
rewarding teams that have reduced spending during 
the COVID-19 crisis without sacrificing product 
quality or customer satisfaction.8

 ‘Lean in’ for talent development
CFOs and their executive peers have a critical 
postpandemic opportunity to develop talent by 
systematically reviewing the talent profile, 
identifying the skills needed now and in the future, 
and working with HR leaders to map skill sets to 
strategic and operating plans. Retailers that shifted 
to a digital-ordering model during the COVID-19 
pandemic, for instance, may require more data 
analysts, programmers, or other types of digital talent 
to maintain or build new online capabilities. If  
so, the CFO and other senior leaders may want to 
establish a skills matrix that outlines key roles  
and responsibilities relevant to the changed 
business context. Using this tool, which will need  
to be refreshed continually, managers can have 
frank conversations (during performance reviews, 

for instance) about the new skills and mindsets 
required in various parts of the organization and 
understand the associated investments in them.9

The CFO can also make the argument for preserving 
some or all of an organization’s employee-training 
budgets. According to industry reports, overall 
training expenditures dropped significantly in 2009 
and 2010 (the Great Recession), followed by a  
surge in 2011 and a drop back to 2008 levels in 2012. 
Rather than sacrifice long-term efficiency and 
resilience for short-term gains, organizations might 
be wise to stick with their existing talent-development 
investment plans, to the extent possible.10

More broadly, CFOs should walk the walk and 
complete capability programs themselves.11 Apart 
from role modeling the desired mindsets and 
behavior, they can also, better than most, help 
business-unit and fellow C-suite leaders think about 
strategic imperatives as a cohesive whole, the  
skills needed to execute the plans, and the impact  
of these activities on the financial health of  
the company.

The CFO’s role in capability building 

161

Capabilities: How CFOs can  
help themselves
Along with increased responsibilities, CFOs have 
taken on a broader set of challenges, and many of 
them may feel less than comfortable. For that 
reason, CFOs may need to reskill themselves in two 
key areas before they can help others reskill. 

Amplify their voices 
Most CFOs likely don’t need to learn new finance 
skills—they are already well versed in the mechanics 
of budgeting, forecasting, and planning. But they 
may need to take a closer look at how they com-
muni cate: What are the best ways for them to impart 
key strategic information or finance concepts  
to others? If CFOs get this part right, they have an 
opportunity to amplify their own voice within the 
performance dialogue. 

In one European metals company, for instance, the 
CFO and finance managers were the first points  
of contact for transforming the data generated by 
the advanced-analytics team and data scientists 
into specific actions the business could take  
to improve production-volume forecasts, factory 
usage, and pricing. The CFO was seen as a  
clear communicator and independent arbiter and  
therefore gained the trust of general managers.  
The suggested changes were implemented, raising 

the company’s overall profitability. Most  
important, the CFO led from the front, proactively 
shaping the corporate agenda in addition to 
managing the traditional responsibilities, such as 
closing the books, reconciling actuals to budget, 
and generating month-end reports. 

Step outside the finance silo
The CFO’s worldview—or sense of how macro trends 
affect micro decisions—is unique, for it includes a 
comprehensive understanding of where individuals 
fit within teams, where teams fit within the company, 
where the company fits within its industry, and 
where the industry fits within a national and global 
context. To construct (and reconstruct) that 
worldview, the CFO must step outside of the finance 
silo and continually scan company operations, the 
industry, and the ever-changing global, political, and 
economic context. The CFO can complement this 
outside view with a perspective on the company’s 
organizational dynamics, its strategic principles, and 
how it creates returns for shareholders. With this 
information, the CFO can help other C-suite leaders 
create a compelling vision for the future and share 
that vision with inspiration and conviction. 

One high-growth organization, for example, faced a 
range of threats, such as new entrants in the market, 
rapidly changing costs, and competitive pricing.  

CFOs have access to data, a cross-
functional perspective, and an expanding 
role as value manager and strategy 
partner. They have a critical role to play 
in ensuring that companies develop  
the skills, mindsets, and behavior for 
long-term success.

162

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionCapability building must be front and center in  
any company’s plans to prepare for the next normal. 
CFOs have access to data, a cross-functional 
perspective, and an expanding role as value manager 
and strategy partner. They therefore have a critical 
role to play in ensuring that companies develop  
the skills, mindsets, and behavior required for long-
term success.

It responded effectively, in part because the CFO 
and other executives had such a clear view of  
the shifting landscape. They assessed their existing 
business model against those of the new entrants, 
identified its strengths and weaknesses, and 
retooled it to better meet changing demand. The 
team built an empirical case for change, drawing on 
data and insights from the company’s analytics 
efforts. Then it shared a compelling narrative with 
the rest of the organization, highlighting the 
opportunities for improvement and gaining buy-in. 
Over time, the organization operated more 
efficiently, gained more value from its key assets, 
and boosted its ROI to all-time highs.

Memo to the CFO: Get in

time on digital initiatives and the application of 
digital technologies to finance tasks.1

But our research also shows that CFOs still spend 
less time on digital trends than they do on traditional 
finance activities. Why? There are few proven 
business cases of digitization in finance and few 
best practices to draw from, so CFOs are often 
content to let colleagues in IT, marketing, or other 
functions press the issue. 

Many CFOs tell us they are unsure where to start; 
the rapid arrival of innovative technologies plus  
a general shortage of top technology talent won’t 
make it any easier. CFOs must begin to experiment, 
however, or risk falling behind other functional 
groups in the organization and other companies  
in the industry whose digital transformations  
are already under way. They might lose a golden 
opportunity to help drive the business agenda. 

A good start would be for CFOs to work with the 
CEO, the board, and others on the senior-leadership  
team to proactively and systematically identify  
tasks and processes within the finance function that

The digital finance organization remains an 
emerging concept in many organizations, and CFOs 
are still at one remove from the center of digital-
transformation efforts, even though they own and 
manage much of the relevant business information 
that feeds such initiatives. There is a clear mandate 
for them to take the lead: today’s CEOs and boards 
say they want CFOs and the finance function to 
provide real-time, data-enabled decision support. 
And, in our most recent survey of finance executives, 
CFOs themselves say they want to spend more

would most benefit from digitization. They can then 
locate and invest in the technologies and 
capabilities required to improve these areas. 

There are four areas of technology that, right now, 
we believe show the most promise for use in finance 
(Exhibit 1): 

The digital future: Emerging use cases
Digitization is now a realistic goal for the finance 
function because of a range of technological 
advances. These include the widespread availability 
of business data; teams’ ability to process large sets 
of data using now-accessible algorithms and 
analytic methods; and improvements in connec tivity 
tools and platforms, such as sensors and  
cloud computing. 

CFOs and their teams are the gatekeepers for  
the critical data required to generate forecasts and 
support senior leaders’ strategic plans and 
decisions—among them, data relating to sales, order 
fulfillment, supply chains, customer demand, and 
business performance as well as real-time industry 
and market statistics. 

 — automation and robotics to improve processes  

in finance 

 — data visualization to give end users access  

to real-time financial information and improve 
organizational performance

 — advanced analytics for finance operations to 

accelerate decision support

 — advanced analytics for overall business opera-
tions to uncover hidden growth opportunities 

CFOs may decide to champion and pursue 
investments in one or all of these areas. Much will 
depend on the company’s starting point—its  
current strategies, needs, and capabilities and its 
existing technologies and skill sets. It is important

to note that digital transformation will not happen  
all at once, and companies should not use their legacy 
enterprise resource planning and other backbone 
systems as excuses not to start the change. By 
working on small pilot projects and successfully 
digitizing the most critical tasks within finance,  
the CFO can establish proof points and ease the 
eventual rollout of digital technologies across  
the entire function and across other parts of  
the company. 

Simplifying processes through 
automation and robotics 
Research from the McKinsey Global Institute 
concludes that 40 percent of finance activities (for 
instance, cash disbursement, revenue management, 
and general accounting and operations) can  
be fully automated, and another 17 percent can be 
mostly automated (Exhibit 2). Those figures 
demonstrate the degree to which CFOs and other

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionbusiness leaders can simplify core internal trans-
actions through automation, establish standardized 
reporting mechanisms, and work more efficiently. 

A critical tool that leading-edge finance groups  
are already exploring is robotic process automation 
(RPA), a category of automation software that 
performs redundant tasks on a timed basis and 
ensures that they are completed quickly, efficiently, 
and without error.2 Task-automation tools such as 
RPA have advanced to the point they are no longer 
applied only in discrete business activities but 
across multiple areas of the business. The companies 
successfully implementing RPA at scale have done 
so by altering their operating models and redesigning 
their processes. Finance staffers are receiving 
training on RPA technology, so they no longer need  
to throw workflow requests to an already 
overworked IT organization. That improvement has 
made it easier for some companies to move beyond 
RPA pilot tests and realize tangible outcomes. 

After analyzing automation opportunities as a 
follow-up to a two-year lean-transformation process, 
a large European utility deployed RPA technology  
in several pilot areas, including “master data manage-
ment.” Its process for creating system profiles  
for new vendors (or updating information on existing 
vendors), for instance, involved a series of manual 
tasks that could often take employees several hours 
a day to complete. But the end-to-end process 
steps were mainly rule-based, and all the data were 
in digital form, which made the “vendor-creation 
task” a key candidate for RPA. Ultimately, the utility 
increased overall productivity within the finance 
function in its shared-service group by about  
20 percent, given time-and-cost savings associated 
with the deployment of RPA in this pilot area as  
well as several others.

The use of RPA at one European bank has created 
other advantages. The bank has combined RPA  
with natural-language-generation software to create 
monthly spending reports. A back-office system 
collects and analyzes the data and automatically 
builds the “spending story”—for example, listing key 
performance indicators and adding red flags in 

those instances with statistically meaningful 
changes in countries or product groups. Rather than 
having to take the time to generate such reports  
by hand, financial controllers can use the automated 
information to engage in higher-level tasks, such as 
considering how to address red flags.

Improving organizational performance 
through data visualization 
If finance functions’ experiments with automation 
are largely about optimizing processes, their 
experiments with data visualization are about improv-
ing broader organizational performance. Indeed,  
to make good resource-allocation decisions, teams 
need real-time financial information. They often  
lack access to such data because stores of data are 
in different parts of a company, data formats are not 
comparable, or data are not available at all. 

Some finance groups are pairing automation 
capabilities with data-visualization technologies, 
however, to create clear, timely, actionable business 
reports. These reports quickly push data to end  
users and present data in intuitive formats that 
encourage focused business discussions. 

The finance organization at a large consumer-goods 
company, for instance, has deployed a self-service 
approach. Rather than wait for reports, sales staff 
can use visual dashboards (accessible from a laptop 
or mobile device) to get the data they need when 
they need it—by region, business unit, function, or 
other parameters as required. Sales managers and 
other executives pull the data from a central 
repository that is continually refreshed, so they can 
quickly get an accurate read on how demand is 
changing. This self-serve approach has decreased 
by more than 50 percent the need for the finance 
group to generate reports and has cut the cost of 
reporting by 40 percent. 

Similarly, the executive board at a European 
technology company no longer uses PowerPoint. 
Business leaders instead use large touch screens  
to access real-time data about finances and 
operations. The information is presented in easy-to-

read graphs that highlight deviations from plan. The 
graphs are dynamic, redrawing themselves as users 
swap variables in and out.

CFO and the finance function can use advanced 
analytics to manage standard financial transactions 
and core processes more efficiently and shape  
(and accelerate) tactical discussions. 

The CFO and other business leaders will need to 
collaborate with the CEO, chief information officer, 
and IT organization to integrate data-visualization 
tools with a company’s established systems. They will 
need to draw on expertise from data scientists and 
data analysts who might work in IT or directly with 
the finance function. Such experts can help the CFO 
rethink end-to-end finance processes (such as 
data-to-report, purchase-to-pay, and order-to-cash 
processes) and rebuild them using a visual, user-
focused approach. 

The CFO will also need to learn how to manage 
processes and communication within a “data 
democracy”—where business information is available 
anytime, anywhere, for everybody. It is inevitable  
in such an environment that the business units will 
request more and more data, not less. The CFO  
will need to work with the CEO and other business 
leaders to establish rules around data usage  
that reflect the specific information requirements  
of decision makers across the organization.  
They will also need to ensure that they are using the 
highest-quality data. Otherwise there will be 
analytical anarchy.

Once CFOs understand the role advanced analytics 
can play in improving financial processes, they  
can work with the CEO, the board, and other senior 
leaders to identify broader ways of applying 
advanced analytics to uncover new sources of 
business value. Indeed, every CFO should explicitly 
define the leadership role he or she wants to play  
in translating burning business questions into use 
cases for advanced analytics—whether to  
optimize pricing, identify customer churn, prevent 
fraud, manage talent, or explore a host of  
other applications. 

Standard transactions
A truck manufacturer uses advanced analytics to 
monitor general sales of forklifts because it  
views this metric as an early indicator of its own 
sales. Finance teams at other companies are  
using advanced analytics to identify duplicate 
expenses and invoices or to connect the  
terms of procurement and payment schedules  
for a good or service with actual invoices so  
they can spot early or missed payments or 
opportunities to apply discounts. 

Finding value through  
advanced analytics
Companies in all industries are now experimenting 
with advanced analytics—mining troves of business 
data (on people, profits, processes, and so on)  
to find relevant insights that can improve business 
leaders’ tactical decision making. Similarly, the  

Core finance processes
A chemical company uses advanced analytics to 
improve its demand forecasting. Traditionally, its 
forecasting models relied on basic, internal 
customer data and used historical trends to predict 
future demand. Furthermore, the forecasts were  
at an aggregate level—that is, for entire classes of 
chemicals rather than individual ones. The company 

168

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editioncross-referenced internal customer data with 
external data sets, such as stock prices, revenues, 
weather, exchange rates, and business-cycle 
indexes, to generate forecasts for specific regions 
and SKUs. In this way, the company could examine 
whether existing forecasts were accurate or not and 
react accordingly.

Tactical discussions
A US consumer-goods company is exploring the  
use of advanced analytics in better predicting sales-
volume changes associated with pricing moves for 
certain SKUs. The company is building a forecasting 
tool that will gather and analyze data on the SKUs  
in pilot testing; the data include macroeconomic 
factors, geographic factors, demographics, and other 
variables. Armed with this information, business 
leaders hope to be able to alter pricing decisions on 
the fly, as needed.

The digital agenda: Getting started
CFOs and their teams can kick-start the digitization 
process by taking inventory of core use cases  
and determining where they stand with each of the 
digital technologies cited here. They should ask 
themselves questions regarding the potential value 
gained from digitization of a finance process as  
well as the level of feasibility of doing so—a process 
that we call “performing a value scan.” They should 
engage business-unit leaders in discussions about 
the pain points in various financial processes,  
such as slow reporting and incomplete data. They 
should undergo a systematic review of technology 
capabilities with members of the IT function to define 
system requirements and investments. 

But to truly succeed in building a digital finance 
function, CFOs will need to address critical 
organizational and talent-related issues (Exhibit 3).

It is important, for instance, to develop a clear vision 
of the desired target state for a digital finance 
function and how that links to the company’s overall 
business and digital strategy. The CFO and other 
senior leaders will need to promote the digital agenda 
openly—for instance, by sharing success stories  
at town halls and team meetings and advocating for 
cross-functional collaboration between technology 
and business-operations teams. 

The CFO should engage with other senior leaders to 
refine competency models, particularly those 
associated with the finance function, to recruit and 
retain the employees needed to carry out a digital 
agenda. Requirements might include a willingness 
to learn about new technologies or process- 
design expertise—skills that go above and beyond 
traditional finance tasks. CFOs and senior leaders 
might need to significantly redo incentives and 
compensation schemes to combat resistance to 
change and reward those who support the creation 
of a digital finance function. Such incentives can also 
help the company attract top digital talent. 

Perhaps most important, CFOs will need to 
collaborate with other business leaders to ensure 
that any digitization and transformation efforts 

adhere to the company’s cybersecurity standards. 
They might even invite members of the cybersecurity 
team to sit with members of the IT and finance 
functions to share objectives and discuss mutual 
concerns.3 The CFOs who lead the charge toward 
digitization will not only help the finance function work 
more efficiently—potentially bolstering their candi-
dacies for leadership positions inside or outside their 
organizations—but also become stronger partners 
of CEOs and business units. 

For all the benefits of digitizing the finance function 
we have outlined, there are many issues a bot or  
an algorithm still cannot address, such as when you 
have collected scant data or when you are assessing 
strategies over a longer time horizon and more 
human judgement is necessary. But the possibilities 
far outweigh the obstacles at this point, and the 
mandate is clear: CFOs must develop and share with 
other senior leaders a vision for a digital finance 
function. They have a clear opportunity to shape the 
evolution of their companies and gain valuable 
insights and experiences along the way. But those 
insights and experiences will not come if CFOs  
don’t take the first steps.

finance activities are already compelling—a 
resounding success in some areas, even if perfor-
mance is mixed in others. Today’s cheaper, better, 
and faster technology seems destined to reshape 
the finance function—and without the multiyear 
headaches that many CFOs associate with early 
enterprise-resource-planning (ERP) installations.

As in other business settings where automation  
has become increasingly viable, its implications in 
finance look to be disruptive for companies  
and outsourcers alike. The trend raises issues that 
executives must consider as they adopt a more 
automated finance operating model, whether inter-
nally or through outsourcing. For starters, 
automating the finance function may be enticing 
conceptually, but benefits can be elusive. CFOs

For years, a global pharmaceutical company had 
outsourced its procure-to-pay finance activities, 
such as processing invoices and paying suppliers. 
Savings from low-cost labor and improved 
processes had yielded savings, but managers were 
eager to explore whether automation could unlock 
new opportunities. After assessing for themselves 
how much work could be automatable, estimating 
the value at stake, and calculating the investment 
required, they challenged the company’s offshore 
business-process outsourcer (BPO) to show that  
it could compete with an automated model. In the 
end, the pharmaco managers decided not to  
bring the outsourced elements home to automate.

will need a clearer understanding of what kinds of 
activities can be automated. To take full advantage 
of the opportunity, they’ll also need to rethink 
processes and organizations around the technology 
in a fundamental way. And they will need to manage 
the disruption to get through the effort without 
breaking an already stretched function.

Understand what can be automated
Finance organizations perform a wide range of  
activ ities, from collecting basic data to making 
complex decisions and counseling business leaders. 
As a result, the potential for improving performance 
through automation varies across subfunctions  
and requires a portfolio of technologies to unlock 
the full opportunity. Applying the same method ology 
outlined in the McKinsey Global Institute’s 
automation research, we found that currently 

demonstrated technologies can fully automate  
42 percent of finance activities and mostly automate 
a further 19 percent. 

About a third of the opportunity in finance can be 
captured using basic task-automation technologies 
such as robotic process automation (RPA).  
Working atop existing IT systems, RPA is a class of 
general-purpose software often referred to  
as “software robotics”—not to be confused with 
physical robots. RPA and complementary 
technologies, like business-process management 
and optical character-recognition tools, have  
been applied successfully across a number of 
activities in finance (exhibit).

Many of the technologies that enable basic task 
automation, including robotic process automation, 
have been around for some time—but they’ve

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary Editionbeen getting better, faster, and cheaper over the 
past decade. Moreover, many automation platforms 
and providers were start-ups a decade ago, when 
they struggled to survive the scrutiny of IT security 
reviews. Today, they’re well established, with the 
infrastructure, security, and governance to support 
enterprise programs. Today’s task-automation  
tools are also easier to deploy and use than first 
generation technologies. Where a manger once had 
to wait for an overtasked IT team to configure  
a bot, today a finance person can often be trained to 
develop much of the RPA work flow. We estimate 
that it makes sense from a cost/benefit perspective 
to automate about half of the work that can be 
technically automated using RPA and related task-
automation technologies. 

Capturing the remainder of the opportunity requires 
advanced cognitive-automation technologies, like 
machine-learning algorithms and natural-language 
tools. Although they are still in their infancy, that 
doesn’t mean finance leaders should wait for them 
to mature fully. The growth in structured data  
fueled by ERP systems, combined with the declining 
cost of computing power, is unlocking new 
opportunities every day. 

One technology company, for example, developed 
an algorithm that monitors internal and external  
data to audit expense reports. The algorithm cross-
checks them against travel data and personnel 
data—since travel needs vary by role and rank—to 
highlight potentially fraudulent activity. In this  
case, the company uses the output to identify areas 
where policies may be unclear, not for enforcement. 
A similar effort enabled the company to audit 
vacation time continuously: an algorithm compared 
declared vacation days with data from badge  
swipes and computer-usage data to confirm 
whether employees were reporting vacation time 
accurately. Cases like these represent the  
beginning, not the end, of what’s possible with 
cognitive-automation technologies.

Rethink people and processes around  
the technology
Today, processes in the finance function are 
purposefully designed to harness the collective 
brain power and knowledge of many people.  
The temptation for managers as they implement  
an automation program is to follow that same 
pattern, retrofitting a particular automation tool into 
the existing process. Moreover, managers often  
see automation as a technology initiative that can be 
led by the IT department. As a result, companies  
end up with a patchwork of incongruous technology 
tools that automate separate and distinct parts  
of the process. This approach is fine for capturing the 
first 5 percent or so of automation’s impact. But 
unlocking the full potential requires a fundamentally 
different way of thinking. 

To capture that potential, managers must be willing 
to reengineer their processes completely. At  
one global financial company, for example, team 
managers systematically went through each part of 
the record-to-report process, redesigning the 
activities and organizational structures around a 
portfolio of technologies. These managers used 
task-automation technologies such as robotic 
process automation for purposes such as preparing 
journal entries, as well as cognitive-automation 
technologies such as machine learning to reconcile 
differences among disparate accounting records. 
Although they haven’t yet begun deploying natural-
language tools to produce report commentary,1  
they have not only proved that these technologies 
work but also designed their processes to adopt 
them down the road. The result was a road map that 
these managers expect will unlock 35 percent 
savings from automation over the next two years. 

At a heavy-equipment producer, managers had long 
used spreadsheets to forecast monthly sales and 
production. Frustrated with the time consumed and 
the imprecision of manual forecasts, they tasked a 
team of four data scientists with developing an

algorithm that would automate the entire process. 
Their initial algorithm used all the original sales and 
operations data, as well as additional external 
information (about weather and commodities, for 
example). In this case, within six months, the 
company eliminated most of the manual work 
required for planning and forecasting—with  
the added benefit that the algorithm was better  
at predicting market changes and business- 
cycle shifts. 

Manage the disruption
In theory, finance has many opportunities to 
redeploy its people. Financial-planning and financial- 
analysis professionals could be retasked to  
support the business. Tax specialists could be 
refocused to maximize after-tax income. 

But, especially in transactional functions, the  
hard reality is that automation—if implemented 
effectively—will inevitably lead to changes in 
organizational structures, redefined roles, and 
layoffs. At one global financial institution, the  
CFO is on pace to release a quarter of the company’s 
20,000-person shared-services organization  
over the next 24 months. That’s bound to be 
disruptive, and there’s no point in pretending these 
realities don’t exist or trying to hide an automation 
program behind closed doors. 

The leadership and vision of the CFO, in particular,  
are paramount, just as with any finance 
transformation. In our experience, the best approach 
is to manage automation systematically along  
these lines:

Start with the more mundane, transactional 
tasks, which inherently have higher turnover. 
Rather than releasing a lot of people, in many cases 
you just don’t fill existing roles as people leave. 
Also, such roles usually don’t require a major organi-
zational redesign to capture automation’s benefits.  
A team that currently requires 20 people could 
simply reduce its head count to ten by using a fully  
or partially automated solution. Going after basic 
tasks first allows the remaining employees to focus 
on the more professionally rewarding tasks, and 
early wins create the capacity and funding that help 
the finance function to fund other parts of the 
automation journey by itself. 

One institution started by rolling out some 200 bots 
to automate work at its offshore shared-services 
centers. That allowed the company to develop  
a playbook, a governance model, and a workforce-
management strategy that could be deployed 
elsewhere. It also created the foundation needed  
to consider automating more complex, higher- 
order processes, such as financial modeling  
and audit. 

174

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionCreate a human-resources and placement 
capability that works in lockstep with the CFO 
and the finance function. 
Automating more complex activities, such as a 
company’s controllership and tax functions, often 
means releasing people, since these areas have  
less turnover than more transactional work. For many 
companies, redeploying people has proved a 
challenge. Most just take the savings or, worse, incur 
new automation costs without a corresponding 
reduction in labor spending. Thoughtful workforce 
planning is critical.

Communicating a plan for the affected workers well 
before automation tools are introduced can help. 
The necessary steps include designing the future 
organizational structures, telling people exactly 
what you’ll do to evaluate them fairly, and promising 
to do your utmost to create opportunities for 
redeploying personnel. Maintaining a constant lineup 
of open positions in finance and other parts of the 
company can further minimize the impact on people. 
Honesty and transparency are critical.

One North American bank, for example, explicitly 
mapped the automation solutions it was using to the 
approximately 200 finance employees affected. 
Before the organization introduced the technology, 
it had a plan to redeploy employees in more valuable 
roles. To date, the company has found ways to 
redeploy nearly 50 of them to other areas within and 
outside the finance function. 

Adapt the recruiting and retention profile to get 
the finance professionals you need. 
Even if technology intimidates some employees, a 
willingness—and ability—to learn new tools is 
important. Future leaders will be quite excited by a 
function on the leading edge of digitization and 
automation. And even CFOs of companies that aren’t 
planning an automation program in the next year  
or two should seek out and recruit people who will 
be prepared for it when it happens. 

One technology company undertook such an effort 
by creating an internship program to attract 
machine-learning talent to the finance function. The 
company maintains data sets that can be used to 
automate activities ranging from financial forecasting 
to internal audit. Each year, two or three students 
from a local university spend the summer building 
algorithms and bots. Not all of these efforts 
succeed, but the company has begun implementing 
at least half a dozen solutions developed by the 
interns. Similar programs will be critical to attracting 
talent that can lead an increasingly automated 
finance function. 

Automation is already reshaping the future of work  
in the finance function, and the opportunity to boost 
performance will fuel the trend. Adapting to 
disruption is challenging, but CFOs who build a clear 
early perspective on the nuances of the automation 
journey will be well positioned to thrive.

Debiasing 
investment  
and strategy 
decisions 

Think fast: Who invented behavioral economics  
and behavioral finance? Pioneers such as Daniel 
Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and others brought  
an understanding of decision making, rationality, 
and biases to the mainstream by the end of the 
20th century.

But three centuries earlier, Joseph Penso de  
la Vega—born to a family of Spanish–Portuguese 
Jewish refugees who resettled in Amsterdam— 
was already theorizing about how human decision 
making can influence financial choices. In  
his seminal 1688 work Confusión de Confusiones 
(Confusion of Confusions), de la Vega remarked  
that he often saw incongruities at the stock 
exchange. He observed that poor outcomes resulted 
from the way people tended to behave, and that good 
ideas could be muddled by common wisdom.

176

“If, for example,” Penso de la Vega wrote, “there 
arrives a piece of news which would induce 
[someone] to buy, while the atmosphere prevailing  
at the stock exchange forces him to sell, his rea-
soning fights his own good reasons … his reasoning 
drives him to buy, because of the information that 
has just arrived,” but he decides to sell nonetheless. 
Why? The risks, even considering the new infor-
mation, can suddenly feel too high. Or because the 
market seems to know something, the market 
must be correct—right? 

Not necessarily. As de la Vega pointed out, and  
as people and businesses continue to grapple  
with today, information can be incomplete. 
Perspectives can exist beyond those of any one 
person’s immediate or broader circle, and different 
scenarios can lead to very different outcomes. 

In a financial context, managers should work to 
maximize future cash flows, weighting scenarios  
by their assumed probabilities. Too often, even  
the smartest and best-informed managers  
wind up making decisions based on what feels 
comfortable—or more likely feels the least 
uncomfortable—even when they have a nagging 
suspicion that reasoning and reasons don’t quite 
match up or that not all voices have been heard. 

Biases are not just part of the human condition; 
they can also flourish throughout organizations. 
More and more, we’ve been pushing our own 
thinking about how to debias decisions, particularly 
with respect to resource allocation and strategy.

Overcoming a bias  
against risk

Risk-averse midlevel managers making routine investment decisions can 
shift an entire company’s risk profile. An organization-wide stance toward 
risk can help.

by Tim Koller, Dan Lovallo, and Zane Williams

biases in human behavior might lead managers  
to overstate the likelihood of a project’s success and 
minimize its downside.1 Such biases were certainly 
much debated during the financial crisis.

Often overlooked are the countervailing behavioral 
forces—amplified by the way companies structure 
their reward systems—that lead managers to become 
risk averse or unwilling to tolerate uncertainty even 
when a project’s potential earnings are far larger 
than its potential losses.2 In fact, the scenario above 
is based on the experience of a senior executive  
in a global high-tech company who ultimately chose 
the smaller investment with the lower up-front  
cost. That variation of the project would allow him to 
meet his earnings goals, and even though the 
amount of additional risk in the second variation was 
small—and more than offset by a five-fold increase 
in the net present value—it still outweighed the 
potential rewards to him.

For projects of this size at a large company, the profit 
forgone by choosing a safer alternative—putting 
less money at risk with a shorter time to payoff—is 
modest: in this case, about $20 million. But the 
scenario becomes more worrying when you consider 
that dynamics like this play out many times per  
year across companies, where decisions are driven

Here’s a quick test of your risk appetite. Your 
invest ment team has approached you with two 
variations of the same project: you can either invest  
$20 million with an expected return of $30 million 
over three years or you can invest $40 million  
with an expected return of $100 million over five 
years (and a bigger dip in earnings in the early  
years). In each case, the likelihood that the project 
will fail and yield nothing is the same. Which  
would you choose?

Much of the commentary about behavioral economics 
and its applications to managerial practice, including 
our own, warns against overconfidence—that

by the risk appetite of individual executives rather 
than of the company as a whole. In a single large 
com pany making hundreds of such decisions 
annually, the opportunity cost would be $2 billion if 
this were to happen even 20 times a year over five 
years. Variations of this scenario, played out in 
companies across the world, would result in under-
investment that would ultimately hurt corpo rate 
performance, shareholder returns, and the economy 
as a whole.

Mitigating risk aversion requires that companies 
rethink activities associated with investment projects 
that cause or exacerbate the bias, from the 
processes they use to identify and evaluate projects 
to the structural incentives and rewards they use  
to compensate managers.

A widespread challenge
The right level of risk aversion depends on the size of 
the investment. CEOs making decisions about  
large, unique investments are typically more risk 
averse than overconfident—and they should  
be, since failure would cause financial distress for 
the company.

In contrast, midlevel executives making repeated 
decisions about the many smaller investments that a 
company might make during the course of a year—

expanding a sales force at a consumer goods 
company into a new geography, for example, or 
introducing a product-line extension at an 
electronics firm—should be risk neutral. That is,  
they should not overweigh negative or positive 
outcomes relative to their actual likelihood of 
occurrence. Decisions about projects of this size 
don’t carry the risk of causing financial distress—
and aversion to risk at this level stifles growth and 
innovation. Risk aversion is also unnecessary 
because statistically, a large number of projects are 
extremely unlikely all to fail (unless they are highly 
correlated to the same risks). Yet many managers at 
this level—who make many such investments over a 
career—exhibit an unwarranted aversion to risk.

In fact, we frequently run across CEOs stymied by 
their company’s struggle with risk; decisions that 
may be in the best interest of individual executives, 
minimizing the risk of failure, are actually harmful  
for their companies. As the CEO at a manufacturing 
company observed, his company’s business unit–
level leaders gravitate toward relatively safe, 
straightforward strategies with earnings goals that 
seem reachable, even if these strategies mean 
slower growth and lower investment along the way. 
We have also heard from many nonexecutive  
board members that their companies are not taking 
enough risks.

Mitigating risk aversion requires  
that companies rethink activities that 
cause or exacerbate bias, from the 
processes they use to evaluate projects 
to the structural incentives they use 
to compensate managers.

179

Overcoming a bias against riskTheir anecdotal observations are consistent with 
findings we reported last year that suggested 
executives are as risk averse about small investments 
as they are about large ones.3 When we tested  
how 1,500 executives from 90 countries reacted to 
different investment scenarios, we discovered that 
they demonstrated extreme levels of risk aversion 
regardless of the size of the investment, even when 
the expected value of a proposed project was 
strongly positive. Specifically, when presented with 
a hypothetical investment scenario for which the 
expected net present value would be positive even 
at a risk of loss of 75 percent, most respondents 
were unwilling to accept it on those terms. Instead, 
they were only willing to accept a risk of loss from  
1 to 20 percent—and responses varied little, even 
when the size of the investment was smaller by  
a factor of ten. This is almost shocking, as it suggests 
that the level of risk aversion is remarkably constant 
within organizations, when it should vary based  
on the size of the investment and its potential to 
cause financial distress.

Understanding the source of  
risk aversion
Much of the typical risk aversion related to smaller 
investments can be attributed to a combination  
of two well-documented behavioral biases. The first 
is loss aversion, a phenomenon in which people  
fear losses more than they value equivalent gains. 
The second is narrow framing, in which people  
weigh potential risks as if there were only a single 
potential outcome—akin to flipping a coin only 
once—instead of viewing them as part of a larger 
portfolio of outcomes—akin to flipping, say, 50 coins. 
Together, these two biases lead to a distinctive  
set of preferences outlined in Daniel Kahneman  
and Amos Tversky’s prospect theory, which  
was largely the basis for Kahneman’s 2002 Nobel 
Prize in Economics.4

Consider a simple example of a risk-averse 
manager5 weighing whether to invest $50 million 
today in a project that has an equal likelihood of 

returning either $100 million or $0 a year from now. 
If we were to ignore the time value of money, we 
would expect a risk-neutral manager to be indifferent 
to the project—because the potential gains are equal 
to the potential losses. If the upside were greater 
than $100 million, we would expect the same manager 
to make the investment. However, the upside would 
have to be almost $170 million to entice the typical 
risk-averse manager to make the investment.  
In other words, the upside would have to be about  
70 percent larger in order for that manager to 
overcome his or her aversion to risk.

But what if we were to pool these risks across 
multiple projects? If the same manager faced not one 
decision but ten, the story would change. The 
manager’s range of outcomes would no longer be  
an all-or-nothing matter of success or failure, but 
instead a matter of various combinations of 
outcomes—some more successful, some less. In  
this case, the same manager would be willing to 
invest if the upside were only $103 million, or only  
2 to 3 percent above the risk-neutral point.  
In other words, pooling risks leads to a striking 
reduction in risk aversion.

Many of the managerial tactics used by companies 
in their capital allocation and evaluation processes 
fail to take note of these basic behaviors. By 
considering the success or failure of projects in 
isolation, for example, they fail to understand  
how each will add risk to the company’s overall 
portfolio and institutionalize a tendency toward risk 
aversion, essentially recreating the narrow  
framing that occurs at the individual level. To make 
matters worse, many companies also hold 
individuals responsible for the outcomes of single 
projects that have substantial uncertainty and  
fail to distinguish between “controllable” and 
“uncontrollable” events, leaving people accountable 
for outcomes they cannot influence. As a result, 
many companies wind up with risk aversion at the 
corporate level that resembles that at the  
individual level—squandering the risk-bearing 
advantages of size and risk pooling that should

risk aversion by promoting an 
organization-wide attitude toward 
risk that guides individual 
executive decisions. 

be one of their greatest strategic advantages. In fact, 
many companies seem to exacerbate loss aversion, 
which is the primary driver of risk aversion.

Toward a company-wide approach  
to risk
Companies can reduce the effects of risk aversion, 
where appropriate, by promoting an organization-
wide attitude toward risk that guides individual 
executive decisions. More specifically, companies 
should explore the following:

Up the ante on risky projects. Risk-averse 
organizations often discard attractive projects before 
anyone formally proposes them. To encourage 
managers and senior executives to explore innovative 
ideas beyond their comfort levels, senior executives 
might regularly ask them for project ideas that  
are risky but have high potential returns. They could 
then encourage further work on these ideas  
before formally reviewing them. They could also 
require managers to submit each investment 
recommendation with a riskier version of the same 
project with more upside or an alternative one.

Consider both the upside and downside. Executives 
should require that project plans include a range of 
scenarios or outcomes that include both failure and 
dramatic success. Doing so will enable project 
evaluators to better understand their potential value 
and their sources of risk.

These scenarios should not simply be the baseline 
scenario plus or minus an arbitrary percentage. 
Instead, they should be linked to real business drivers 
such as penetration rates, prices, and production 
costs. For example, when evaluating the introduction 
of a new consumer goods product, managers  
should explicitly consider what a “home run” 
scenario would look like—one with high market 
share or high realized unit prices. They should  
also look at a scenario or two that captures the 
typical experience of product introductions,  
as well as one scenario where it flops. By forcing  
this analysis, executives can ensure that the 
likelihood of a home run is factored into the analysis 
when the project is evaluated—and they are  
better able to thoughtfully reshape projects to 
capture the upside and avoid the downside.

Avoid overcompensating for risk. Managers should 
also pay attention to the discount rates they use to 
evaluate projects. We repeatedly encounter 
planners who errantly use a higher discount rate 
simply because an outcome is more uncertain  
or the range of possible outcomes is wider (see 
“Avoiding a risk premium that unnecessarily kills your 
project”). Higher discount rates for relatively  
small but frequent investments, even if they are 
individually riskier, do not make sense once  
projects are pooled at a company level.

Instead, if companies are concerned about risk 
exposure, they might adopt a rule that any investment 
amounting to less than 5 to 10 percent of the 

181

Overcoming a bias against riskcompany’s total investment budget must be made in 
a risk-neutral manner—with no adjustment to the 
discount rate.

Evaluate performance based on portfolios of 
outcomes, not single projects. Wherever possible, 
managers should be evaluated based on the 
performance of a portfolio of outcomes, not punished 
for pursuing more risky individual projects. In oil and 
gas exploration, for example, executive rewards are 
not based on the performance of individual wells  
but rather on a fairly large number of them—as many 
as 20 in one company. Hence, it may not be 
surprising to find that oil and gas executives pool 
risks and are more risk neutral.

Reward skill, not luck. Companies need to better 
understand whether the causes of particular 
successes and failures were controllable or 
uncontrollable and eliminate the role of luck, good or  
bad, in structuring rewards for project managers. 

They should be willing to reward those who execute 
projects well, even if they fail due to anticipated 
factors outside their control, and also to discipline 
those who manage projects poorly, even if they 
succeed due to luck. Although not always easy to do, 
such an approach is worth the effort.

The corporate center must play an active role in 
implementing such changes—in setting policy, 
facilitating risk taking, and serving as a resource to 
help pool project outcomes. It will need to become 
an enabler of risk taking, a philosophy quite different 
from that currently expressed by many corporate 
centers. The office of the CFO should also be involved 
in oversight, since it is particularly well suited  
to serve as manager of a company’s portfolio of 
risks, making trade-offs between them and  
taking a broader view of projects and the effects  
of risk pooling.

accounting” and “nudging”—concepts that explain 
why individuals and organizations sometimes act 
against their own best interests and how they can 
challenge assumptions and change behaviors. 

In this edited interview with McKinsey’s Bill Javetski 
and Tim Koller, Thaler considers how business 
leaders can apply principles of behavioral economics 
and behavioral finance when allocating resources, 
generating forecasts, or otherwise making hard 
choices in uncertain business situations. 

Write stuff down
One of the big problems that companies have in 
getting people to take risks, is something called 
hindsight bias—that after the fact, people all think 
they knew it all along. So if you ask people now,  
did they think it was plausible that we would have an 
African-American president before a woman 
president, they say, “Yeah, that could happen.” All 
you needed was the right candidate to come  
along. Obviously, one happened to come along. But, 
of course, a decade ago no one thought that  
that was more likely. So, we’re all geniuses after  
the fact. Here in America we call it Monday- 
morning quarterbacking.

Whether standing at the front of a lecture hall  
at the University of Chicago or sharing a Hollywood 
soundstage with Selena Gomez, Professor  
Richard H. Thaler has made it his life’s work to 
understand and explain the biases that get  
in the way of good decision making. 

In 2017, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for  
four decades of research that incorporates human 
psychology and social science into economic 
analysis. Through his lectures, writings, and even a 
cameo in the feature film The Big Short, Thaler 
introduced economists, policy makers, business 
leaders, and consumers to phrases like “mental

One of the problems is CEOs exacerbate this 
problem, because they have hindsight bias. When a 
good decision happens—good meaning ex ante,  
or before it gets played out—the CEO will say, “Yeah, 
great. Let’s go for that gamble. That looks good.” 
Two years later, or five years later, when things have 
played out, and it turns out that a competitor came 
up with a better version of the same product that we 
all thought was a great idea, then the CEO is going  
to remember, “I never really liked this idea.”

One suggestion I make to my students, and I make 
this suggestion about a lot of things, so this may  
come up more than once in this conversation, is “write 
stuff down.” I have a colleague who says, “If you 
don’t write it down, it never happened.”

What does writing stuff down do? I encourage my 
students, when they’re dealing with their boss—be  
it the CEO or whatever—on a big decision, not 
whether to buy this kind of computer or that one but

some agreement on the goals, what are we trying to 
achieve here, the assumptions of why we are going 
to try this risky investment. We wouldn’t want to call 
it a gamble. Essentially [we need to] memorialize  
the fact that the CEO and the other people that have 
approved this decision all have the same assumptions, 
that no competitor has a similar product in the 
pipeline, that we don’t expect a major financial crisis.

You can imagine all kinds of good decisions taken in 
2005 were evaluated five years later as stupid.  
They weren’t stupid. They were unlucky. So any 
company that can learn to distinguish between bad 
decisions and bad outcomes has a leg up.

Forecasting follies 
We’re doing this interview in midtown New York, and 
it’s reminding me of an old story. Amos Tversky, 
Danny Kahneman, and I were here visiting the head 
of a large investment company that both managed 
money and made earnings forecasts. 

We had a suggestion for them. Their earnings 
forecasts are always a single number: “This company 
will make $2.76 next year.” We said, “Why don’t  
you give confidence limits: it’ll be between $2.50 
and $3.00, 80 percent of the time.”

They just dropped that idea very quickly. We said, 
“Look, we understand why you wouldn’t want to do 
this publicly. Why don’t you do it internally?”

Duke [University] does a survey of CFOs I think every 
quarter. One of the questions they ask them is a 
forecast of the return on the S&P 500 for the next  
12 months. They ask for 80 percent confidence 
limits. The outcome should lie between their high 
and low estimate 80 percent of the time. Over  
the decade that they’ve been doing this, the outcome 
occurred within their limits a third of the time, not  
80 percent of the time.

the worst-case scenario, was zero. That’s hopelessly 
optimistic. We asked the authors, “If you know 
nothing, what would a rational forecast look like, 
based on historical numbers?” It would be plus  
30 percent on the upside, minus 10 percent on the 
downside. If you did that, you’d be right 80 percent 
of the time—80 percent of the outcomes would 
occur in your range. But, think about what an idiot 
you would look like. People would say, “Really? 
That’s your forecast? Somewhere between plus 30 
and minus ten?” It makes you look like an idiot.

It turns out it just makes you look like you have no 
ability to forecast the stock market, which they 
don’t; nor does anyone else. So providing numbers 
that make you look like an idiot is accurate. Write 
stuff down. Anybody that’s making repeated 
forecasts, there should be a record. If you have a  
record, then you can go back. This takes some 
patience. But keeping track will bring people  
down to earth.

Nudging the corporation
The organizing principle of nudge is something we 
call choice architecture. Choice architecture is 
something that can be applied in any company. How 
are we framing options for people? How is that 
influencing the choices that they make? It can go 
anywhere from the mainstream ideas of nudge, so, 
say, it might involve making employees healthier. 

One of the nice things about our (I call it) new 
building at Chicago Booth—I think it must be getting 
close to 15 years old, but to us it’s still a new 
building—one of the things the architect did was the 
faculty is divided across three floors: third, fourth, 
and fifth floors. There are open stairwells that 
connect those floors, which does two things. One, it 
gives people a little more exercise. Because those 
stairs are very inviting, in a way that the stairwells 
that serve as fire exits are just the opposite.

The reason is their confidence limits are way too 
narrow. There was an entire period leading up to the 
financial crisis where the median low estimate,  

Two, it makes us feel more connected. You can hear 
people. I’m on the fourth floor, so in the middle. If  
I walk down the hall, I may have a chance encounter 
not just with the people on my floor but even

There’s lots of talk about diversity these 
days. We tend to think about that in 
terms of things like racial diversity, 
gender diversity, and ethnic diversity. 
Those are all important. But it’s also 
important to have diversity in how 
people think.

with people on the adjacent floors. Because I’ll  
hear somebody’s voice, and I wanted to go talk to 
that guy.

Those things are all important. But it’s also important 
to have diversity in how people think.

There are lots of ways you can design buildings that 
will make people healthier and make them walk 
more. I wrote a little column about this in the New 
York Times, about nudging people by making  
stuff fun. There was a guy in LA [Los Angeles] who 
wrote to me and said that they took this seriously. 
They didn’t have an open stairwell in their building, 
but they made the stairwell that they did have  
more inviting. They put in music and gave everybody 
two songs they could nominate. They put in 
blackboards where people could post decorations 
and funny notes. I was reading something recently 
about another building that’s taken this idea.

Since you have to use a card to get in and out of the 
doors, they can keep track of who’s going in and  
out. So they can give you feedback on your phone  
or your Fitbit on how many steps you’ve done in  
the stairwells. [The same principles of nudge can be 
applied to] every decision the firm is making.

On diversity
There’s lots of talk about diversity these days. We 
tend to think about that in terms of things like racial 
diversity, gender diversity, and ethnic diversity. 

When I came to Chicago in 1995, they asked me to 
help build up a behavioral-science group. At the 
time, I was one of two senior faculty members. The 
group was teetering on the edge of extinction.  
We’re close to 20 now, and as we’ve been growing, 
I’ve been nudging my colleagues.

Sometimes we’ll see a candidate and we’ll say, “That 
guy doesn’t seem like us.” They don’t mean that 
personally. They mean that the research is different 
from the research we do. Of course, there is a limit. 
We don’t want to hire somebody studying astro-
physics in a behavioral-science department. But I 
keep saying, “No, we want to hire people that  
think differently from how we do, especially junior 
hires. Because we want to take risks.” That’s the 
place to take risks. That person does things that are 
a little different from us.

Either that candidate will convince us that that 
research is worthwhile to us, or will maybe come 
closer to what we do, or none of the above, and  
he or she will leave and go somewhere else. None of 
those are terrible outcomes. But you go into a lot  
of companies where everybody looks the same and 
they all went to the same schools. They all think  
the same way. And you don’t learn.

186

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionThere’s a quote—I may garble it—from GM’s Alfred P. 
Sloan, ending some meeting, saying something  
like, “We seem to be all in agreement here, so I 
suggest we adjourn and reconvene in a week, when 
people have had time to think about other ideas  
and what might be wrong with this.”

I think strong leaders, who are self-confident and 
secure, who are comfortable in their skin and their 
place, will welcome alternative points of view.  
The insecure ones won’t, and it’s a recipe for disaster. 
You want to be in an organization where somebody 
will tell the boss before the boss is about to do 
something stupid.

You need to figure out ways to give people feedback, 
write it down, and don’t let the boss think that  
he or she knows it all. Figure out a way of debiasing 
the boss. That’s everybody’s job. You’d like it to  
be the boss’s job, but some bosses are not very 
good at it.

Making better decisions through 
technology
There’s lots of fear about artificial intelligence. I tend 
to be optimistic. We don’t have to look into the  
future to see the way in which technology can help 
us make better decisions. If you think about how 
banks decide whom to give a credit card and how 
much credit to give them, that’s been done using  
a simple model for, I think, 30 years at least.

What I can see is that the so-called moneyball 
revolution in sports—which is gradually creeping 
into every sport—is making less progress in the 
human-resources side than it should. I think that’s 
the place where we could see the biggest changes 
over the next decade. Because job interviews are,  
to a first approximation, useless—at least the 
traditional ones, where they ask you things like, “What 
do you see yourself doing in ten years, or what’s  
your biggest weakness?”

So-called structured interviews can be better, but 
we’re trying to change the chitchat into a test, to 
whatever extent you can do that. We wouldn’t hire a 
race car driver by giving them an interview. We’d  

put them in a car, or better yet, because it would  
be cheaper, behind a video game and see how  
they drive.

It’s harder to see how people make decisions. But 
there’s one trading company I used to know pretty 
well. They would recruit the smartest people they 
could find right out of school. They didn’t care if they 
knew anything about options. But they would get 
them to bet on everything, and amounts of money 
that, for the kids, would be enough that they would 
think about it. So there’s a sporting event tonight, 
and they’d all have bets on it. What were they trying 
to do? They were trying to teach them what it  
feels like to size up a bet, what it feels like to lose  
and win. This was part of the training and part  
of the evaluation.

That was the job they were learning how to do, how 
to be traders. Now that job probably doesn’t exist 
anymore, but there’s some other job that exists. 
Figure out a way of mimicking some aspects of that, 
and test it, and get rid of the chitchat. Because  
all that tells you is whether you’re going to like the 
person, which may be important if it’s somebody 
you’re going to be working with day and night. If a 
doctor is hiring a nurse that’s going to work in  
a small office, it’s important that you get along. But  
if you’re hiring somebody that’s going to come  
to work in a big, global company, the chance that the 
person interviewing that candidate will work with 
that candidate is infinitesimal. So we don’t really care 
what the interviewer thinks of the interviewee. We 
care whether the interviewee will add something to 
the organization.

On loss aversion
I was teaching a course for maybe 22 executives, all 
from the same company. It was a horizontally 
integrated publishing company. The executives were 
each the head of some publication—a magazine, 
newspaper, what have you, back when there were 
such things. The CEO of the company was also 
attending, sitting in the back. I asked each of the 
executives, “How would you feel about an investment 
that will have one of two outcomes: half the time it 
will make $2 million. Half the time it will lose

$1 million. How many of you would take that 
investment?” Two guys raised their hand. I turned to 
the CEO, and I said, “Suppose I gave you a portfolio 
of such investments. And let’s assume they’re 
independent. How many of them do you want?” He 
said, “All of them.” I said to the CEO, “Then you have  
a problem. You want 23 of these investments. You’re 
getting two. You’re doing something wrong.”

We started talking to the individual executives about 
why [most of them] wouldn’t take that investment. 
They said, “Look, it wouldn’t make any sense for me 

to take it. Suppose I get the good outcome. Maybe I 
get a $50,000 bonus and a pat on the back. But 
suppose it doesn’t work out and I get fired. That’s 
not a good gamble.” The odds for the company  
were great, but the odds for each individual decision 
maker were lousy.

How can you solve that problem? The only way I 
know of really is to aggregate. That’s what the CEO 
was doing, he was aggregating. You have to take 
that perspective—which is hard to do in life, because 
decisions come one at a time.

Bias Busters

Taking the ‘outside view’

Using a reference class can help executives gain much-needed 
perspective to inform their decision making.

by Tim Koller and Dan Lovallo

Do you have enough data to make a decision? 
Maybe. Are the data enough to make the right 
decision? Probably not. Research shows that film 
executives overestimate potential box-office 
revenue most of the time. 

The research
That’s because film executives often take what 
Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman and colleagues 
refer to as the “inside view.”1 They build a detailed 
case for what is going to happen based on the 
specifics of the case at hand rather than looking at 
analogous cases and other external sources of 
information. (If they do look at other data, it’s often 
only after they’ve already formed impressions.) 
Without those checks and balances, forecasts can 
be overly optimistic. Movie projects, large capital-
investment projects, and other initiatives in which 
feedback comes months or years after the initial 
decision to invest is made often end up running late 
and over budget. They often fail to meet 
performance targets. 

The remedy
One way to make better forecasts, in Hollywood and 
beyond, is to take the “outside view,” which means 
building a statistical view of your project based on a 
reference class of similar projects. Indeed, taking 
the outside view is essential for companies seeking 
to understand their positions on their industries’

The dilemma
You’re the head of a major motion-picture studio, 
and you must decide whether to green-light a movie 
project. You need to predict whether it will be boffo 
(a box-office hit) or a bust. To make this decision, you 
must make two interrelated forecasts: the costs of 
production and potential box-office revenue. 

Production costs are easy, you think: you know  
the shooting days, specific location costs, and 
computer-generated-imagery costs. You can enter 
these into a spreadsheet that reflects the film’s 
production plan. Potential box-office revenue is 
harder to predict, but you know roughly how  
many screens the film will be on during opening 
weekend, how “hot” your stars are right now,  
and how much you’re going to spend  
on advertising.

power curves of economic profit.2 To understand how 
the outside view works, consider an experiment 
performed with a group at a private-equity company. 
The group was asked to build a forecast for an 
ongoing investment from the bottom up—tracing its 
path from beginning to end and noting the key steps, 
actions, and milestones required to meet proposed 
targets. The group’s median expected rate of return 
on this investment was about 50 percent. The  
group was then asked to fill out a table comparing 
that ongoing investment with categories of similar 
investments, looking at factors such as relative 
quality of the investment and average return for an 
investment category. Using this outside view, the 
group saw that its median expected rate of return 
was more than double that of the most similar 
investments (exhibit).

The critical step here, of course, is to identify the 
reference class of projects, which might be five cases 
or 500. This process is part art and part science—
but the overriding philosophy must be that there is 
“nothing new under the sun.” That is, you can  
find a reference class even for groundbreaking 
innovations—something music company EMI (of the 
Beatles fame) learned the hard way. 

In the 1970s, EMI entered the medical-diagnostics 
market with a computed-tomography (CT) scanner 
developed by researcher and eventual Nobel  
Prize winner Godfrey Hounsfield. The company had 
limited experience in the diagnostics field and  
in medical sales and distribution. But based on an 
inside view, senior management placed a big bet  
on Hounsfield’s proprietary technology and sought 
to build the required capabilities in-house. 

It took about five years for EMI to release its first 
scanner; in that time, competitors with similar X-ray 
technologies as well as broader, more established 
sales and distribution infrastructures overtook EMI. 
In seeking to do everything alone, EMI suffered 
losses and eventually left the market. Building  
a reference class would have allowed the company 
not only to predict success in the market for CT 
scanners but also to develop a more effective go-to-
market strategy.3 

Compared with EMI’s situation, finding a reference 
class for a film project might seem like a no-brainer: 
you figure there will be lots of movies in the same 
genre, with similar story lines and stars, to compare 
with the focal project. And yet, when we asked

analogues he typically used to forecast movie 
revenue, he answered, “One.” And when we inquired 
about the most he had ever used, he said, “Two.” 
Research shows that using the correct reference 
class can reduce estimation errors by 70 percent.4

Companies often think it’s too hard and too time-
consuming to build a reference class, but it isn’t. In 
an effort to improve the US military’s effectiveness  
in Iraq in 2004, Kalev Sepp, a former special-forces 

officer in the US Army, built a reference class of  
53 counterinsurgency conflicts with characteristics 
of the Iraq war, complete with strategies and 
outcomes. He did this on his own in little more than 
36 hours. He and his colleagues subsequently  
used the reference class to inform their decisions 
about critical strategy and policy changes.  
Other organizations can do the same—learning  
as much from others’ experiences as they do  
from their own.

The benefits of thinking 
like an activist investor

Whether or not your company is in the crosshairs of activists, assembling a 
team to take a good, hard look at your performance can deliver benefits. 

by Joseph Cyriac, Snezhana Otto, and David Wells

who invite dissent to challenge unconscious bias 
expect dissenters to fall in line once a decision is 
made. And in the absence of an occasional external 
point of view, that singular commitment can blind 
executives and board directors to opportunities as 
their company, the industry, and the economy 
around them change.

Shining light on those blind spots also requires more 
than just a typical strategy review. In our experience, 
that’s where an activist role play can help. Managers 
give participants in such exercises (often called  
a “red team”) deliberate license to challenge their 
thinking across the board, including strategy, 
performance, governance, and even compensation,  
with no holds barred. That’s the kind of exercise that 
many activists do when targeting prospective 
companies. For those who successfully emulate 
activist thinking, the opportunity can be striking:  
top-quartile activist campaigns are associated with 
sustained excess total shareholder returns of  
more than 9 percent even three years out. It can also 
better prepare managers, who seldom prevail  
in disputes with activists, to better respond to  
their overtures.

The rapid growth and influence of activist investors 
has many executives nervously looking over their 
shoulders. Even large companies are increasingly 
vulnerable. But there is a benefit to be had for those 
managers with the courage to take as hard a look at 
their own company’s performance as a performance- 
minded outsider might. The objective isn’t 
necessarily for managers to do what activists would 
do—activists’ performance is mixed, after all. Instead, 
the goal is for managers to examine their own 
strategy, governance, and operations with an eye to 
unearthing opportunities to improve performance. 

Doing so, of course, requires acknowledging 
vulnerability. Managers, like all good leaders, are 
often successful because once they’ve made a 
strategic decision, they commit themselves 
psychologically to following through. Even those 

Deploying an activist role play
The activist mind-set is, at its heart, a hypersensitive 
focus on shareholder value creation. Learning to 
think that way is usually only possible if senior 
managers agree to subject themselves to a role play

The goal is to emulate the most 
constructive sort of activists who propose 
fundamental changes to improve  
long-term performance.

that bulldozes through established patterns of 
thinking and deliberately looks for gaps and  
missed opportunities. The goal is to emulate the 
most constructive sort of activists who propose 
fundamental changes to improve long-term 
performance—typically supporting their case with 
sophisticated outside-in analyses of strategic  
and operational performance. 

Done well, an activist role-play approach is 
substantially more provocative than a standard 
strategy review. The tone can be aggressive,  
even confrontational. In one pharmaceutical 
company, the red team’s efforts sparked a much 
more drastic portfolio conversation than the  
usual incremental shifting of resources among 
therapeutic areas. Where there was a highly 
heterogeneous portfolio, adopting the activist’s 
perspective drove consideration of much more 
drastic portfolio actions for parts of the portfolio 
that were not a natural fit. This approach helped 
compel executives to take an outside perspective 
and be a catalyst for overdue changes. 

The setup matters. In our experience, the activist role 
play can liberate management thinking by creating 
an environment where all options are on the table and 
there are no sacred cows. It is one thing to read a 
report that suggests some changes to the operating 
model, and it is quite another to be the CEO in the 
hot seat and be questioned on perfor mance, 
competence, board composition, and compensation. 
Moreover, while many CEOs may believe that 

everyone in their organization is empowered to 
speak out openly and freely, it’s fre quently the case 
that, at some point during a role play, one of the 
CEO’s direct reports will sheepishly raise a hand and 
recall the time that his opinion on an important item 
was unceremoniously quashed. 

Focusing on strategy, performance,  
and governance
Mock activist role plays needn’t cover the entire 
landscape of a company’s business. It’s possible to 
anticipate where the activists who care about  
long-term value creation will focus their attention. 
That can give companies a good idea of where  
to deploy this approach to examine performance 
through the external lens of an activist.

Portfolio strategy and capital allocation. It can be 
hard for companies to admit that a business unit  
in their portfolio would be better owned by another 
business, or that a turnaround isn’t, as many 
managers like to think, “just two quarters away.” In 
our experience, this isn’t a sign of empire building  
as much as it is an indication that management teams 
honestly believe that they are a business unit’s best 
owner. To them, asking them to divest a business  
is akin to asking a parent which of the children would 
be better parented by someone else?

But activists have no such misgivings. An activist will 
take a hard look at the synergies among a company’s 
different businesses—excluding general and

administrative synergies in corporate overhead, since 
another owner of similar scale could reap the same 
benefits. They will challenge the ability of the owner 
to manage well all businesses in a diverse portfolio. 
And for activists, past performance doesn’t 
guarantee that a business stays in the portfolio;  
they will consider any unit that does not meet 
performance criteria as a candidate for restructuring, 
divesting, or harvesting. 

At times, portfolio strategy may be right, but that may 
not be apparent to investors. One bank placed a 
significant premium on reporting the performance of 
each of its business units as if they were stand-
alone businesses. While this approach aimed for 
transparency and business-unit accountability, 
investors saw it differently. The message they 
received was that these businesses were indepen-
dent of one another and that the parent was 
effectively a conglomerate. By taking a skeptical 
outside-in perspective, managers realized they 
needed to change their communications with 
investors to highlight the value of cross-selling and 
other operational synergies among businesses. 

harvesting opportunity. It can also evaluate whether 
the company sufficiently redeploys resources  
to the businesses it intends to keep—new growth 
platforms or businesses with a clear competitive 
advantage in the market. Take, for example, the 
experience of one basic-materials company. By 
applying an activist’s hypersensitive shareholder-
value-creation perspective, managers realized  
that a legacy vertical-integration play had led the 
company to subsidize a unit that would have  
been loss making as a stand-alone entity. As a result, 
they diverted growth capital away from this unit  
and toward a unit further downstream that could 
generate more free cash flow.

Financial strategy. Among the most visible targets 
of activist demands are financial strategies that 
don’t appear to be friendly to investors. Activists will 
evaluate a company’s leverage or debt-to-equity 
ratios by benchmarking to likely market peers. They’ll 
ask hard questions about tax efficiency and  
whether a business has too much or too little debt. 
And they’ll weigh a company’s deployment of  
excess cash—whether it could be invested or 
returned to shareholders.

Assuming that the right portfolio strategy and 
communication is in place, an activist would also 
evaluate whether capital was allocated to the  
most attractive parts of a company’s portfolio. The 
skeptical view in an activist role play can highlight 
which businesses should be considered a growth and 
investment opportunity—or an efficiency and 

Activist role plays should raise the same questions. 
Consider the example of one large, high-performing 
technology company. Managers and the board of 
directors firmly believed that they should be investing 
for growth—as they had done since the company 
was founded decades earlier. Indeed, the company

to take a different perspective on how a 
company conducts its benchmarking.

194

repurchase program. However, the company had 
grown to a market value of more than $30 billion  
and was enormously profitable. It took a hard push 
by the red team to make managers see that their 
commitment to the narrative behind the company’s 
success had to change. 

Operating performance. A savvy activist will use 
outside-in assumptions to benchmark each business 
segment in a company’s portfolio against best-in-
class peers, as well as the combined enterprise. 

The activist lens can compel managers to take a 
different perspective on how a company conducts 
its benchmarking. For example, one large pharma-
ceutical company was accustomed to benchmarking 
performance against its peers. However, when it 
looked at individual business units in the role play, it 
uncovered a different story and highlighted a 
number of issues in the cost structure of different 
parts of the portfolio. It was also clear that in  
certain areas, such as consumer marketing, the 
company was underspending, and there was  
too much R&D spend on business units that would 
not yield the same return on investment. That 
challenged the company’s legacy of spreading 
savings targets equally across all the business  
units, which was at the heart of the company’s 
operating mind-set. 

Similarly, adopting an activist perspective can  
help set a higher bar for operating improvements.  
At one consumer retail company, for example, 
managers took an activist perspective on opera-
tional benchmarking to review their performance 
goals. From the outside in, they realized, an activist 
would likely see incremental changes as insufficient. 
They then used that insight to build a case for 
change with expectations of doubling their margin 
improvement and improving working-capital 
efficiency by 50 percent. Companies could go even 
further. With a more radical margin aspiration and 
case for change, a company taking the activist 
perspective may contemplate going beyond industry 
benchmarks and applying a zero-based budgeting 
approach to fundamentally rethink parts of its  
cost base. 

Governance. Activists will take a hard look at 
company boards to evaluate whether they  
constitute strong, competent oversight on behalf  
of shareholders relative to entrenched insiders. 
Companies will need to ensure board members have 
relevant, specific expertise. Ideally, boards would 
include both industry veterans familiar with what 
has historically determined success and functional 
experts from other industries that are ahead—in 
digital delivery, for example. Such functional experts 
can bring a perspective on the trends that will  
shape the industry’s future. It is also critical that this 
expertise is communicated to shareholders. 

Companies will also need to signal strong governance 
of the board of directors over management through 
the following measures: 

 — Pressure-testing corporate strategy from an 

outsider’s point of view. Boards of directors often 
only think about the activist perspective 
reactively, after an activist has become involved. 
But considering an activist’s mind-set proactively 
can also help directors to review their strategy 
more rigorously—and leave them better prepared 
to respond to activists when they show up.  
The board of one large healthcare company has 
found the outside-in activist role play so valuable 
in this regard that it involves the board in an 
activist role play as part of its annual strategy-
refresh process. 

 — Linking executive compensation to long-term 

value creation relative to the company’s sector. 
Compensation provisions can have the effect of 
encouraging executives to focus on near-term 
profits at the expense of long-term growth. An 
activist role play can help board directors 
compare compensation metrics with those of 
market peers to ensure that management 
compensation is aligned to performance that 
leads to growth, higher margins, and returns  
on capital. Where appropriate, they may also 
want to build in clawbacks to discourage short-
term moves. That way, activists won’t be able  
to argue that managers are being rewarded more 
than their peers for lower performance.

The benefits of thinking like an activist investor

195

Thinking like an activist can help managers improve 
their own performance before they attract activist 
attention. It can also give them the confidence to 
push back if activists attempt to intervene. 

Thinking through these issues can help provide new 
insights into how to maximize business performance, 
and, in turn, deter activists. The process will also 
help companies develop a response should activists 
come knocking. By incorporating value-creating 
ideas into its plans and effectively communicating 
them to long-term shareholders, companies may 
find that even the most astute activists will be hard 
pressed to dazzle other shareholders with a  
better proposal.

Up-front contingency 
planning

Avoid throwing good money after bad by developing “contingent road 
maps”—plans for updating your investment strategy based on unbiased 
feedback from the market.

by Hugh Courtney, Tim Koller, and Dan Lovallo

time to work out the kinks; maybe a redesign or 
redeployment of the technology to address the 
company’s needs better would do the trick. You still  
see the potential upside here, but you can’t afford to 
throw good money after bad. Given the uncertainties, 
should you continue to invest in this new technology 
and business unit? Research suggests that if you do, 
you may never stop. 

The research 
When making staged-investment decisions, 
managers should focus only on expected future 
returns from their investments, not the costs 
associated with previous investments. These sunk 
costs have already been spent and cannot be 
recovered and are thus irrelevant when deciding 
whether to continue investing. Yet research 
demonstrates that decision makers often focus 
inappropriately on them.1 Studies also reveal  
the degree to which decision makers are subject to 
loss aversion, or putting greater value on avoiding  
losses than on acquiring equivalent gains. It is this 
combination—loss aversion and an inappropriate 
focus on sunk costs—that prompts managers to 
escalate their commitment to certain investments, 
even when there is evidence suggesting that the 
initial decision was probably wrong.

The dilemma 
Investing in a new process technology was supposed 
to breathe new life into an established business unit 
within your manufacturing company. It was supposed 
to be a sure bet, one that would reduce costs and 
allow your company to compete better on price. But 
it’s a full year into the rollout, and those benefits 
haven’t materialized. Meanwhile, your closest 
competitors have launched their own technology 
initiatives and are reducing costs, lowering  
prices, and growing market share. 

You know that when it comes to implementing new 
technologies, early failures are common. It takes

The remedies 
You can counter such irrational escalation and make 
better decisions by developing “contingent road 
maps,” or plans for implementing and updating your 
strategy over time based on unbiased feedback 
from the market. Such road maps capture all the 
changes that may occur in uncertain markets and 
when they might occur. Most important, they 
prescribe specific changes your company must 
make to its strategy under different scenarios. 
Decision makers commit up front to follow the road 
map and take the actions required each step of  
the way—including, in some cases, killing a project 
entirely. The road map then becomes both a  
catalyst for change and a means to insulate 
decision makers from biases. 

When considering the investment in the new process 
technology, for instance, you could define a series  
of “decision forks” (exhibit). At the first fork, either 
the technology would achieve well-defined 
performance specifications within the first year of 
use or the company would sell the business unit  
or link up with a partner that has superior technology. 
If the technology meets its performance goals, the 
company would continue using it in new, 
differentiated product segments. 

The second fork in the road map would occur a year 
later: if the technology meets well-specified market-
share goals by that time, the company would 
continue with its new strategy. If not, again it would 
look to sell the business or seek a partnership.

decisions, managers should focus only 
on expected future returns from their 
investments, not the costs associated with 
previous investments. 

The final fork would occur another year later, when 
the company has more information on competitive 
conduct and profit margins. Strong profits would 
result in the company investing in increased 
manufac turing capacity for this product, while weak 
profits would lead the company to divest the 
business line.

As this example illustrates, contingent road maps 
can help business leaders manage uncertainty  
by generating crucial insights about potential market 
outcomes, allowing business leaders to make the 
right decisions at the right times. More important, 
the tool can help senior leaders steer away from 
status quo strategies when the environment calls  
for bold new ones.2

A better way to brainstorm

Structured conversation during brainstorming sessions removes some of 
the risks that thwart an honest discussion.

again. Frustrated, some business unit leaders  
stay silent, and the brainstorming proceeds in a pro 
forma way, with little debate, as the group circles 
back to the same priorities and growth opportunities 
everyone has heard many times before. 

How can the regional CEO convene a more 
productive brainstorming session?

The research
When it comes to group interactions in the workplace, 
individuals are particularly vulnerable to motivations 
to conform.1 The reasons we conform are varied, but 
according to a five-part model developed by 
professors Paul Nail, Geoff MacDonald, and David 
Levy, they can include the need to avoid rejection  
and conflict, accomplish group goals, or establish 
one’s identity.2 After all, why undercut a superior’s 
views or challenge an opinionated CEO if it means 
somehow diminishing one’s own power, influence,  
or authority? This risk aversion is a big factor in the 
success or failure of brainstorming sessions. 
Consider the situation at the cosmetics company. 
The leadership team’s desire to explore digital 
targets was well known in the company, and once 
that idea was propagated by the regional CEO,  
some business unit heads were deflated: to speak 
out against it could be viewed as a repudiation  
of existing priorities. Individuals’ motivations to

The dilemma 
The regional CEO of a large US cosmetics company 
has invited all the business unit leaders to brainstorm 
about M&A priorities and potential opportunities  
in the new year. Everyone knows that digital acqui-
sitions have been a pet project for the senior-
leadership team. But some business unit heads 
believe the company should look at other targets as 
well—expanding overseas, for instance, where the 
cosmetics market is booming, or investing in organic 
beauty products or a men’s grooming line. Ahead  
of the call, some of the business unit heads even 
prepare pages to support these ideas, citing links to 
current businesses, trend analyses, and so on. On 
the call itself, however, the regional CEO steers most 
of the conversation to digital-growth opportunities—

conform created an environment in which mediocre 
ideas were allowed to flourish and true change was 
less likely to happen. 

The remedy
Anonymous brainstorming, along with silent voting, 
can serve as a counterweight to individuals’ 
motivations to conform and help contributors feel 
like their expertise and ideas are being fairly 
considered. To understand how this works, let’s 
reconsider the brainstorming session at the 
cosmetics company. To ensure that all ideas are truly 
weighted equally, the regional CEO could appoint a 
facilitator to collect ideas written on pieces of paper, 
for instance, or submitted through a central software 
application. (This step would be managed ahead  
of the brainstorming session.) During brainstorming, 
ideas would not be presented in a specific order or 
tied to specific sources, which would free up business 

unit heads and other company leaders to offer 
proposals that may run counter to the senior-
leadership team’s well-known digital stance. The 
facilitator could then read aloud the list of 
submissions, and the business unit heads could vote 
on them independently (and anonymously) to  
reveal the degree of alignment behind each idea. 
Once the submissions have been vetted and 
reprioritized, the group could repeat the silent-voting 
process until a clear choice can be made. 

No question, this type of structured facilitation will 
take more time and effort than a traditional 
brainstorming session—but it has the potential to 
reveal truly original business initiatives that may  
not have come to light had participants’ reputations 
been on the line. Using a structured approach to 
brainstorming removes some of the risks that can 
thwart honest discussion.

McKinsey on Finance Number 80, 20th Anniversary EditionJohn Pierpont (J. P.) Morgan had a ready answer  
at the turn of the 20th century when asked how the 
stock market would perform: “It will fluctuate.”1 And 
so it has for decades, and overwhelmingly for the 
better. As Jeremy Siegel, professor at the Wharton 
School of the University of Pennsylvania, details, 
stocks over the long run have returned an average 
6.5 to 7.0 percent per year (after inflation) since 
about 1800.2

When McKinsey on Finance was first released in 
2001, the market capitalization of the companies 
that made up the S&P 500 Index was about  
$10 trillion. As of mid-June 2022—even after a 
bearish opening to the year—S&P 500 Index  
market capitalization was about $35 trillion. The 
mean total yearly returns (including dividends)  
of the S&P 500 Index from 1996 to mid-June 2022 
is 9.0 percent in nominal terms, or 6.8 percent in 
real terms, right in line with Jeremy Siegel’s 
historical results. On a nominal basis, returns for  
the MSCI World, Emerging Markets, and ACWI 
Indexes have had annualized returns of between  
8 and 10 percent for decades as well. 

While long-term TSR results have been in line with 
historical averages, Morgan was also right: the 
market does fluctuate. The S&P 500 Index declined 
in 2000, 2001, and 2002, followed by a 37 percent 
fall in 2008 and a 22 percent fall in the first half  
of 2022. But from 1996 to mid-June 2022, S&P 500 
Index returns declined annually only five times (six  
if we assume that full-year 2022 will also result in 
an annual decline—as now seems likely). 

A thriving stock market is a powerful, positive force 
for the economy. It creates wealth that can be 
reinvested in economic growth. Without this wealth 
creation and reinvestment, the economy (both 
around the world and in the United States) would be 
much poorer. Reasonable and largely stable long-
term returns (as measured by low stock price 
volatility over ten-year periods) create conditions for 
greater opportunities. They encourage more indi-
viduals to invest in the stock market, which in turn 
provides capital for greater growth and broader 
wealth creation. This benefits not only investors 
but also society: returns are mostly reinvested, 
which drives even more economic growth. 

It is a dynamic that generates more jobs—often  
ones that are less dangerous and more stable. For 
example, in the 1920s, about 25 percent of US  
jobs were in agriculture and about 40 percent were 
in manufacturing or other so-called blue-collar 
occupations. Today, only about 1 percent of US jobs 
are in farming or ranching, and only 20 percent of 
US jobs are blue collar. 

Stock market returns foster competition and 
entrepreneurship as well, which leads to innovation 
and lower costs of products. Without the wealth 
creation and reinvestment encouraged by the free 
market, living standards both in the developed world 
and in emerging markets would be much lower.
