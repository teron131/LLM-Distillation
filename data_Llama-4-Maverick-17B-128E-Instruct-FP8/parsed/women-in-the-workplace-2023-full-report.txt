About the study

Women in the Workplace is the largest study on the state of women in 
corporate America.1 In 2015, McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org 
launched the study to give companies insights and tools to advance 
gender diversity in the workplace. Between 2015 and 2023, over 900 
companies participated in the study, and more than 450,000 people 
were surveyed on their workplace experiences. This year, we collected 
information from 276 participating organizations employing over 10 
million people, surveyed more than 27,000 employees, and conducted 
interviews with people of diverse identities, including women of color, 
LGBTQ+ women, and women with disabilities.2

INTRODUCTION

Debunking Four Myths 
That Hold Women Back

For the ninth year of the Women in the Workplace report, we start with the corporate pipeline 
because it oﬀers a bird’s-eye view of the state of women in corporate America. The story is 
both encouraging and frustrating. Over the last several years, there have been sizable gains in 
senior leadership.3 This is an important step in the right direction and shows what companies 
can accomplish when they focus their eﬀorts on a well-understood problem. However, with 
lagging progress in the middle of the pipeline—and a persistent underrepresentation of 
women of color—true parity remains painfully out of reach.4 

This year’s report debunks four myths about women’s workplace experiences and career 
advancement. A few of these myths cover old ground, but given the notable lack of progress, 
they warrant repeating. A few have re-emerged and intensiﬁed with the shift to ﬂexible work.5  
We hope highlighting them will help companies ﬁnd a path forward that casts aside outdated 
thinking once and for all and accelerates progress for women. The future of work for women 
depends on getting this right.

PART 1

State of the 
Pipeline

6  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: PIPELINE

Despite gains at the top, women 
remain underrepresented 

Over the past nine years, women—and especially women of 
color—remain underrepresented across the corporate pipeline.6 
However, we see a growing bright spot in senior leadership. Since 
2015, the number of women in the C-suite has increased from 17 to 
28 percent, and the representation of women at the VP and SVP 
levels has also improved signiﬁcantly.

Women of color face the steepest drop-oﬀ 
in representation from entry-level to C-suite 
positions. As they move up the pipeline, their 
representation drops by two-thirds. 

Women represent roughly 1 in 4 C-suite leaders, 
and women of color just 1 in 16.

“People need to see leaders who look like 

themselves to understand that it’s possible 
for them.”

These hard-earned gains 
are encouraging yet fragile

Progress remains slow for women at the manager and director levels, 
creating a weak middle in the pipeline and impacting the majority of 
women in corporate America. And the “Great Breakup” continues for 
women at the director level, the group next in line for senior leadership 
positions.8 Similar to last year, women directors are leaving at a higher 
rate than in past years—and at a notably higher rate than men at the 
same level. As a result of these two dynamics, there are strikingly fewer 
women in line for top positions.9

Moreover, progress for women of color is lagging behind. At nearly 
every step in the pipeline, the representation of women of color falls 
relative to white women and men of the same race and ethnicity. Until 
companies address this inequity head on, women of color will remain 
severely underrepresented in leadership positions—and mostly absent 
from the C-suite.

LATINAS OFTEN DON’T SEE THEMSELVES IN LEADERSHIP

Latinas stand out as being the least likely of any group of 
women to receive a raise in the last year and also face the 
steepest climb up the corporate ladder: only 1 percent of 
C-suite executives are Latina. “It’s disheartening to be part of 
an organization for many years and still not see a person like 
me in senior leadership,” explains one Latina professional. 
“Until I see somebody like me in the C-suite, I’m never going to 
really feel like I belong.”

PART 2

Four Myths on 
the State of 
Women at Work

MYTH

Women are becoming less 
ambitious

REALITY

Women are more ambitious than 
before the pandemic—and ﬂexibility 
is fueling that ambition

10  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: AMBITION

Recent headlines suggest that women’s ambition is diminishing. Our data 
tell a diﬀerent story. Women remain highly ambitious, and ﬂexible work is 
helping them pursue their ambitions. 

Women are equally 
as ambitious as men

At every stage of the pipeline, women are as committed to their 
careers and as interested in being promoted as men. Women and 
men at the director level—when the C-suite is in closer view—are also 
equally interested in senior leadership roles. And young women are 
especially ambitious.10 Nine in 10 want to be promoted to the next 
level, and 3 in 4 aspire to become senior leaders.  

Moreover, the pandemic and increased ﬂexibility did not dampen 
women’s ambitions. Roughly 8 in 10 women want to be promoted to 
the next level this year, compared to 7 in 10 in 2019.11 And the same 
holds true for men.

Women of color are even more ambitious 
than white women: 96% say that their career 
is important to them, and 88% want to be 
promoted to the next level. 

“In my next role, I hope to be a director. I like 

my current role, but I would like to see myself 
moving up.”

Workplace ﬂexibility helps 
unlock women’s ambitions

Women who work hybrid or remotely are as ambitious as women and 
men who work on-site. Also, women who work ﬂexibly are just as 
ambitious as women who don’t work ﬂexibly. In fact, ﬂexibility is 
allowing women to pursue their ambitions. One in 5 women say 
ﬂexibility has helped them stay at their organization or avoid reducing 
their hours. A large number of women who work hybrid or remotely 
point to feeling less fatigued and burned out as a primary beneﬁt. And 
a majority of women report having more focused time to get their 
work done when they work remotely.

Women who work hybrid or remotely are no 
more likely than women who work on-site to 
consider reducing their hours or switching to a 
less demanding job.

“Flexible work has made me more productive 

because I can build work around whatever 
I’ve got going on with my personal life. If I 
wake up early in the morning, I can jump 
online and go through emails real quick.”

Women’s ambition remains high 
even as they prioritize their 
personal lives more

The pandemic showed women that a new model of balancing work and 
life was possible. Now, few want to return to the way things were. Most 
women are taking more steps to prioritize their personal lives, but at no 
cost to their ambition—they remain just as committed to their careers, 
and just as interested in advancing, as women who aren’t. These women 
are defying the outdated notion that work and life are incompatible—and 
that one comes at the expense of the other.

Men are also prioritizing both life and career: 
Roughly 60% of men are taking more steps to 
prioritize their personal lives, and like women, 
they are just as ambitious as men who aren’t.

“The house is crazy. A dog, our four kids, a 

wife. Being able to juggle all that is going on 
in the personal life by having ﬂexibility at 
work is extremely important. It leads to a 
healthy balance from my perspective 
between work and personal life.”

The biggest barrier to women’s 
advancement is the “glass ceiling”

REALITY

The “broken rung” is the greatest 
obstacle women face on the path 
to senior leadership 

14  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: BROKEN RUNG

The glass ceiling—a term coined over 40 years ago to describe an invisible barrier 
preventing women from reaching senior leadership—is often cited as the primary 
reason more women don’t rise to the top. Our data point to a bigger problem much 
earlier in the pipeline.

The broken rung remains the biggest 
barrier women face

For the ninth consecutive year, women face their biggest hurdle at the ﬁrst critical 
step up to manager. This year, for every 100 men promoted from entry level to 
manager, 87 women were promoted. And this gap is trending the wrong way for 
women of color: this year, 73 women of color were promoted to manager for every 
100 men, down from 82 women of color last year. As a result of this broken rung, 
women fall behind and can’t catch up.13 

“I’ve always done every task, every 

project ahead of schedule and 
under budget, and I still couldn’t 
get the promotions I saw my white 
colleagues getting.”

15  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: BROKEN RUNG

Here are three things every 
company should know about 
the broken rung:

Women are not responsible for it 

Outdated thinking often points to two explanations for the broken rung: 
women are not asking for promotions, and they’re more likely to step 
away from work. Neither is true. Women at the entry and manager levels 
ask for promotions as often as men do, and they are no more likely to 
leave their company—this year, 17 percent of entry-level men chose to 
leave, compared to 16 percent of women at the same level.

Bias is a strong driver of the broken rung

If women’s career choices don’t explain the broken rung, what does? 
Women are often hired and promoted based on past accomplishments, 
while men are hired and promoted based on future potential. This unfair 
thinking—rooted in what social scientists refer to as “performance 
bias”—can be particularly challenging.16 Because women early in their 
careers have shorter track records and similar work experiences relative 
to their men peers, performance bias can especially disadvantage them at 
the ﬁrst promotion to manager.17

Almost a quarter of women 30 
and under say that their age has 
contributed to them missing out 
on a raise, promotion, or chance 
to get ahead. 

Until the broken rung is ﬁxed, gender parity in 
senior leadership remains out of reach

While companies are increasing women’s representation at the top, doing 
so without addressing the broken rung oﬀers only a temporary stopgap. 
Because of the gender disparity in early promotions, men end up holding 
60 percent of manager-level positions in a typical company, while women 
occupy 40 percent. Since men signiﬁcantly outnumber women, there are 
fewer women to promote to director, and the number of women decreases 
at every subsequent level.  

“A president of a tech company said 

something that stuck with me. She said, 
‘Women are hired for   what they have done. 
Men are hired for what they can become.’ 
Women have to have a proven record, but 
men do not.”

MYTH

Microaggressions 
have a “micro” impact

Microaggressions have a 
large and lasting impact on women

REALITY

17  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: MICROAGGRESSIONS

The term microaggressions implies they’re insigniﬁcant. This is simply not true. In reality, 
microaggressions take a heavy toll on women and inhibit their career progression.

Microaggressions are demeaning or dismissive 
comments and actions— rooted in bias—directed 
at a person because of their gender, race, or other 
aspects of their identity.

Self-shielding, also known as self-monitoring, 
refers to eﬀorts to avoid or protect oneself from 
mistreatment by continuously modifying one’s 
behaviors. This includes code-switching, 
restricting self-expression, or hiding aspects 
of one’s identity. 

Despite the “micro” in their 
name, microaggressions have 
a macro impact

Microaggressions signal disrespect, cause acute stress, and can negatively 
impact women’s careers and health.18 Years of data show that women 
experience microaggressions at a signiﬁcantly higher rate than men: they are 
twice as likely to be interrupted and hear comments on their emotional state. 
For women with traditionally marginalized identities, these slights happen 
more often and are even more demeaning. As just one example, Asian and 
Black women are seven times more likely than white women to be confused 
with someone of the same race and ethnicity.19

As a result, the workplace is a mental mineﬁeld for many women, particularly 
those with traditionally marginalized identities. Women who experience 
microaggressions are much less likely to feel psychologically safe, which 
makes it harder to take risks, propose new ideas, or raise concerns.20 The 
stakes just feel too high. On top of this, 78 percent of women who face 
microaggressions—so the vast majority—self-shield at work, or adjust the 
way they look or act in an eﬀort to protect themselves.21 For example, many 
women choose not to speak up or share an opinion to avoid seeming diﬃcult 
or aggressive to their colleagues. The stress caused by these dynamics cuts 
deep. Women who experience microaggressions—and self-shield to deﬂect 
them—are three times more likely to think about quitting their jobs and four 
times more likely to almost always be burned out.22 By leaving 
microaggressions unchecked, companies miss out on everything women 
have to oﬀer and risk losing talented employees.

Why the “micro” in microaggressions?

The term microaggressions was coined in 1970 by researchers to refer 
to the prejudiced and exclusionary acts that may be more subtle than 
overt discrimination, but nonetheless have a big impact on well-being.23 
The popular misunderstanding that microaggressions are minor or 
insigniﬁcant minimizes the real harm they cause.

ASIAN WOMEN ARE OVERLOOKED AT WORK

Asian women are signiﬁcantly more likely than women overall to be mistaken 
for other colleagues of the same race or ethnicity. This experience, which is all 
too common for Black women as well, is not only disrespectful, but it means 
their contributions at work may go unnoticed. In addition, assumptions about 
their culture signal a lack of attention and respect. “I’ve gotten mistaken for 
Chinese,” explains one Filipino manager. “People will ask me about some kind
of Chinese delicacy assuming that all Asian backgrounds are the same.”

Black women are more than twice as likely as women 
overall to code-switch at work by changing their 
mannerisms, tone, or speaking style. They are also more 
likely than women of other races and ethnicities not to 
speak up or share an opinion to avoid appearing diﬃcult or 
aggressive. “I speak very diﬀerently at home than I do at 
work,” explains one Black woman. “I feel like I have to be

it harder for them to bring their authentic selves to work.

MYTH

It’s mostly women who want— 
and beneﬁt from—ﬂexible work

REALITY

Men and women see ﬂexibility as  
a “top 3” employee beneﬁt and 
critical to their company’s success

23  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: FLEXIBILITY

Stereotypes about women suggest they are the only workers who care about 
ﬂexibility. In reality, a majority of men and women place a high premium on ﬂexible 
work and point to it as a key beneﬁt.

Employees view ﬂexibility as vital 
today—and for the future of work

A vast majority of employees say that opportunities to work remotely and 
have control over their schedules are top company beneﬁts, second only to 
healthcare. Workplace ﬂexibility even ranks above tried-and-true beneﬁts such 
as parental leave and childcare.

Flexibility is also core to how employees view the future of work. Half of women 
and a third of men point to “oﬀering signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in when and where 
employees work” as a top-three factor in their company’s future success. 

As workplace ﬂexibility transforms from a nice-to-have for some employees to a 
crucial beneﬁt for most, women continue to value it more. This is likely because 
they still do a disproportionate amount of childcare and household work.35 

Flexibility refers to remote or hybrid work, as 
well as ﬂexible work options such as the ability 
to set your own hours.

For mothers, ﬂexibility is not just about 
where—but also when—they work. 
Mothers with young children are especially 
likely to rank ﬂexible scheduling as a top 
employee beneﬁt.36 And without ﬂexibility, 
38% say that they would have had to 
otherwise leave their company or reduce 
their work hours.

Employees are increasingly 
comfortable working ﬂexibly

A majority of women and men work more ﬂexibly than 
they did before the pandemic, and relatively few feel 
judged or worry it will negatively impact their careers. 
Most notably, women are far more likely to feel set up to 
succeed when they work this way than they did two 
years ago.

The ability to work remotely delivers 
beneﬁts to most employees

Hybrid and remote work are delivering important beneﬁts to employees. 
Most women and men point to better work-life balance as a primary 
beneﬁt of remote work, and a majority mention less fatigue and burnout. 
And research shows that good work-life balance and low burnout are 
key to organizational success.38

Moreover, 83 percent of employees say the ability to work more eﬃciently 
and productively is a primary beneﬁt of working remotely. However, it’s 
worth noting that companies see this diﬀerently: only half of HR leaders say 
employee productivity is a primary beneﬁt of working remotely.

Women and men cite stress-reducing 
upsides with remote work. 
Twenty-nine percent of women and 
25% of men who work remotely say 
one of the biggest beneﬁts is having 
fewer unpleasant interactions with 
coworkers. Even more—53% of women 
and 36% of men—point to reduced 
pressure around managing their 
personal style or appearance.

When women work remotely, they face fewer 
microaggressions and have higher levels of 
psychological safety.39

On-site work delivers beneﬁts 
to employees—but with room

Employees who work in person also see tangible beneﬁts. A majority 
point to an easier time collaborating and a stronger personal connection 
to coworkers as the biggest beneﬁts of working on-site—two factors 
central to employee well-being and eﬀectiveness. 

However, the culture of oﬃce work may be falling short. While 77 
percent of companies believe a strong organizational culture is a key 
beneﬁt of on-site work, most employees disagree: only 39 percent of 
men and 34 percent of women who work on-site say a key beneﬁt is 
feeling more connected to their organization’s culture. On top of this, 
men are more likely to beneﬁt from working on-site.

Recommendations 
for companies

30  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: RECOMMENDATIONS

As companies work to support and advance women, they should focus on ﬁve core areas:

●

●

Tracking outcomes for women’s representation

Empowering managers to be eﬀective people leaders

● Addressing microaggressions head on

● Unlocking the full potential of ﬂexible work

●

Fixing the broken rung, once and for all 

Track outcomes to improve women’s 
experience and progression

Tracking outcomes is critical to any successful business initiative. Most companies 
do this consistently when it comes to achieving their ﬁnancial objectives, but few 
apply the same rigor to women’s advancement. Here are three steps to get started:

1

Measure employees’ outcomes and experiences—
and use the data to ﬁx trouble spots

Companies should track outcomes for drivers of women’s advancement: hiring, 
promotions, and attrition. Visibility into other metrics that inﬂuence career 
progression is also important, such as participation in career development 
programs, performance ratings, and employee sentiments on job satisfaction 
and inclusion. Then it’s critical that companies mine their data for insights that 
will improve women’s experiences and create equal opportunities for 
advancement. Ultimately, data tracking is only valuable if it leads to 
organizational change.

31  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: RECOMMENDATIONS

2

Take an intersectional approach to 
outcome tracking

Tracking metrics by race and gender combined should be table 
stakes. Yet even now, fewer than half of companies do this, and far 
fewer track data by other self-reported identiﬁers, such as LGBTQ+ 
identity.44 Without this level of visibility, the experiences and career 
progression of women with traditionally marginalized identities can 
go overlooked.

Share internal goals and metrics with employees

3

Awareness is a valuable tool for driving change—when employees are able to 
see opportunities and challenges, they’re more invested in being part of the 
solution.45 In addition, transparency with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 
goals and metrics can send a powerful signal to employees with traditionally 
marginalized identities that they are supported within the organization.

32  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: RECOMMENDATIONS

Support and reward managers as key 
drivers of organizational change

Managers are on the front lines of employees’ experiences and central to 
driving organizational change. As companies more deeply invest in the culture 
of work, managers play an increasingly critical role in fostering DEI, ensuring 
employee well-being, and navigating the shift to ﬂexible work. These are all 
important business priorities, but managers do not always get the direction and 
support they need to deliver on them. Here are three steps to get started:

1

Clarify managers’ priorities and           
reward results

Companies need to explicitly communicate to managers what is 
core to their roles and incentivize them to take action. The most 
eﬀective way to do this is to include responsibilities like career 
development, DEI, and employee well-being in managers’ job 
descriptions and performance reviews. Yet relatively few 
companies evaluate managers on metrics linked to employee 
career progression and satisfaction. For example, although 61 
percent of companies point to DEI as a top manager capability, 
only 28 percent of people managers say their company 
recognizes DEI in performance reviews. This discrepancy may 
partially explain why relatively few employees say their 
manager treats DEI as a priority.

2

Equip managers with the skills they need 
to be successful

To eﬀectively manage the new demands being placed on them, 
managers need ongoing education. This includes repeated, 
relevant, and high-quality training that emphasizes speciﬁc 
examples of core concepts and includes concrete actions that 
managers can incorporate into their daily practices. And topics 
should be carefully selected to give managers the tools they need to 
be successful—for example, a focused training on how to manage a 
dispersed team may be far more valuable than a broader training on 
management essentials. Finally, companies should adopt an “often 
and varied” approach to training and upskilling and create regular 
opportunities for coaching so that managers can continue to build 
the awareness and capabilities they need to be eﬀective.

According to companies, the three 
most critical mindsets and abilities 
for managers are:

1. Treating DEI as a top 

business priority

2. A strong growth mindset and 

willingness to evolve as a leader

3. The ability to build trusting 
relationships with teams

33  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: RECOMMENDATIONS

3

Make sure managers have the time and 
support to get it right

It requires signiﬁcant intentionality and follow-through to be a good 
people and culture leader, and this is particularly true when it comes 
to fostering DEI. Companies need to make sure their managers have 
the time and resources to do these aspects of their job well. On top 
of this, companies should put policies and systems in place to make 
it easier for managers. As a few examples, many managers would 
beneﬁt from sample scripts for challenging conversations and 
standardized questions to gauge their team members’ well-being and 
job satisfaction in one-on-one meetings.46

Take steps to put an end to 
microaggressions

Microaggressions are pervasive, harmful to the employees who 
experience them, and result in missed ideas and lost talent. Companies 
need to address microaggressions head on. Here are three steps to get 
started: 

1

Make clear that microaggressions are     
not acceptable

Many people don’t realize the harm microaggressions cause. 
To raise employee awareness and set the right tone, it’s crucial 
that senior leaders communicate that microaggressions and 
disrespectful behavior of any kind are not welcome. Companies 
can help with this by developing a code of conduct that 
articulates what supportive and respectful behavior looks 
like—as well as what’s unacceptable and uncivil behavior.

2

Teach employees to avoid and      
challenge microaggressions

Most people don’t fully understand how microaggressions 
work, so they end up saying and doing things that are hurtful.48 
Similarly, employees often don’t recognize microaggressions, 
let alone know what to say or do to be helpful.49 That’s why it’s 
so important that companies have employees participate in 
high-quality bias and allyship training and receive periodic 
refreshers to keep key learnings top of mind.

3

Create a culture where it’s normal to 
surface microaggressions

It’s important for companies to foster a culture that encourages 
employees to speak up when they see microaggressions or 
other disrespectful behavior. Although these conversations can 
be diﬃcult, they often lead to valuable learning and growth. 
Senior leaders can play an important role in modeling that it is 
safe to surface and discuss these behaviors.50

36  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: RECOMMENDATIONS

Invest in tracking and optimizing ﬂexibility

The past few years have seen a transformation in how we work. Flexibility is now the norm in
most companies; the next step is unlocking its full potential and bringing out the best of what
diﬀerent work arrangements have to oﬀer. Here are three steps to get started:

1

Establish clear expectations and norms 
around working ﬂexibly

Without this clarity, employees may have very diﬀerent and 
conﬂicting interpretations of what’s expected of them, which 
can create confusion and make coordination on and across 
teams diﬃcult. As part of this process, companies need to ﬁnd 
the right balance between setting organization-wide guidelines 
and allowing managers to work with their teams to determine 
an approach that works best for them.

2

Measure the impact of new initiatives to 
support ﬂexibility and adjust as needed

The last thing companies want to do is ﬂy in the dark as they 
navigate the transition to ﬂexible work. As organizations roll out 
new practices and programs to support ﬂexibility, they should 
carefully track what’s working, and what’s not, and adjust their 
approach accordingly—a test-and-learn mentality and a spirit of 
co-creation with employees are critical to getting these 
changes right.

Women at companies with supportive ﬂexible 
policies are more likely to report having equal 
opportunities to advance—and are less likely to 
consider leaving.

Most employers now oﬀer opportunities to 
work ﬂexibly and remotely—and the vast 
majority have maintained or increased 
their ﬂexible work options in the last year. 
Yet less than 10% of HR leaders point to 
“oﬀering signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in where and 
when employees work” as a top-three 
driver of their company’s future success, 
compared to 42% of employees. This 
misalignment may signal that companies 
have not yet internalized how beneﬁcial 
ﬂexibility is to their employees—and by 
extension, to their business.

37  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: RECOMMENDATIONS

3

Put safeguards in place to ensure a level 
playing ﬁeld across work arrangements

Companies should take steps to ensure that employees aren’t 
penalized for working ﬂexibly. This includes putting systems in 
place to make sure that employees are evaluated fairly, such as 
redesigning performance reviews to focus on results, rather than 
when and where work gets done. Managers should also be 
equipped to be part of the solution. This requires educating 
managers on ﬂexibility stigma and the importance of making sure 
their team members get equal recognition for their contributions 
and equal opportunities to advance. In addition, to ensure the 
playing ﬁeld is leveled, companies should track outcomes by work 
arrangement to see if employees are getting the same 
opportunities and advancing at similar rates.

Flexibility stigma is the unfair judgment that 
employees often face when they work ﬂexible hours 
or work from home. Research shows that employees 
who work ﬂexibly face more doubts about their 
productivity and commitment, even when they 
produce the same results as their colleagues.51

Few companies currently track outcomes 
across work arrangements. For example, 
only 30% have tracked the impact of their 
return-to-oﬃce policies on key DEI outcomes.

Fix the broken rung for women, 
with a focus on women of color

Fixing the broken rung is a tangible, achievable goal and will set oﬀ a 
positive chain reaction across the pipeline. After nine years of very little 
progress, there is no excuse for companies failing to take action. 
Here are three steps to get started:

1

2

Track inputs and outcomes

To uncover inequities in the promotions process, companies
need to track who is put up for and who receives promotions, by 
race and gender combined. Tracking with this intersectional lens 
enables employers to identify and address the obstacles faced 
by women of color, and companies can use these data to identify 
otherwise invisible gaps and reﬁne their promotions processes.

Work to de-bias performance reviews 
and promotions

Leaders should put safeguards in place to ensure that evaluation 
criteria are applied fairly and bias doesn’t creep into 
decision-making. Companies can take these actions:

● Send “bias” reminders before performance evaluations 

and promotion cycles explaining how common biases 
can impact reviewers’ assessments. Research shows 
that anti-bias training can wear oﬀ over time, so seasonal 
refreshers like this can make a big diﬀerence.53

● Appoint a “bias monitor” to keep performance evaluations 

and promotions discussions focused on the core criteria for 
the job and surface potentially biased decision-making. 
Research shows that this has a large impact by shutting 
down conversations that are likely inﬂuenced by bias.54 

● Have reviewers explain the rationale behind their 

performance evaluations and promotion recommendations. 
When individuals have to justify their decisions, they are 
less likely to make snap judgments or rely on gut feelings, 
which are prone to bias.

Companies need clear evaluation 
criteria to stop bias from entering 
hiring and reviews. Evaluation tools 
should be easy to use and designed 
to gather measurable, objective input 
that can be compared across 
candidates.

39  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: RECOMMENDATIONS

3

Invest in career advancement for women 
of color

Companies should make sure their career development programs 
address the distinct biases and barriers that women of color 
experience. Yet only a fraction of companies tailor career program 
content for women of color. And given that women of color tend to 
get less career advice and have less access to senior leaders, 
formal mentorship and sponsorship programs can be particularly 
impactful.55 It’s also important that companies track the outcomes 
of their career development programs with an intersectional lens
to ensure they are having the intended impact and not 
inadvertently perpetuating inequitable outcomes.

Less than half of companies track the outcomes 
of career development programs by gender and 
race combined, and fewer than 1 in 5 do so for 
sponsorship and mentorship programs.

CORPORATE PIPELINE BY INDUSTRY
Industries have diﬀerent talent pipelines

Although women are broadly underrepresented in corporate America, the talent pipeline varies 
by industry. Some industries struggle to attract entry-level women (e.g., Technology: Hardware; IT 
and Telecom; Engineering and Industrial Manufacturing), while others fail to advance women into 
middle management (Energy, Utilities, and Basic Materials) or senior leadership (Oil and Gas).

RESEARCH PARTICIPATION

This report is based on research from 276 companies across the United 
States and Canada, building on similar research conducted annually by 
McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.Org since 2015, as well as research from 
McKinsey & Company in 2012.

A total of 276 participating companies from the private, public, and social 
sectors submitted talent pipeline data, and 274 of them also submitted HR 
policies and programs data. In addition, more than 27,000 employees from 33 
companies were surveyed on their workplace experiences. We also 
interviewed 39 women and nonbinary individuals, including people of diﬀerent 
races and ethnicities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities at all 
levels in their organizations, working remotely, hybrid, or on-site.

We grouped companies by industry to create benchmarks that provide peer 
comparisons. The number of companies from each industry is as follows:

● Asset Management and Institutional Investors—28

● Banking and Consumer Finance—22

● Consumer Packaged Goods—9

● Energy, Utilities, and Basic Materials—17

● Engineering and Industrial Manufacturing—25

● Food and Beverage Distribution—7

● Food and Beverage Manufacturing—7

● Healthcare Systems and Services—23

● Insurance—12

● IT Services and Telecom—6

● Media and Entertainment—5

● Oil and Gas—9

● Pharmaceutical and Medical Products—18

● Professional and Information Services—8

● Public and Social Sector—7

● Restaurants—12

● Retail—10

● Tech: Hardware—13

● Tech: Software—20

● Transportation, Logistics, and Infrastructure—15

● Other—3

Where appropriate, some statements describing women’s experiences in 
the workplace were taken from past survey data that have been published 
in prior Women in the Workplace reports.

PIPELINE DATA AND ANALYTICS  

Overall Metrics 

All pipeline metrics (e.g., representation, promotion rates, hiring shares, 
attrition rates) were initially calculated for each participating company. 
Company results were then averaged for each industry and each industry’s 
data were weighted by the composition of the Fortune 500 in 2022. This 
enabled us to avoid overemphasizing or underemphasizing particular 
industries and better estimate trends over time based on each year’s 
sample of companies. 

The industry breakdown of the Fortune 500 used for our weighting was:

● Energy and Basic Materials—19%

● Engineering and Automotive and Industrial Manufacturing—10%

● Finance—19%

● Food and Restaurants—7%

● Healthcare—8%

● Media and Entertainment—2%

● Professional and Information Services—4%

● Retail—18%

● Tech—11%

● Transportation, Logistics, and Infrastructure—3%

Deﬁnition of Job Levels 

Companies categorized their employees into six levels based on the 
following standard deﬁnitions, taking into account reporting structure and 
salaries. The levels and deﬁnitions provided were: 

● L1—Executives: CEO and direct reports to CEO, responsible for 
company operations and proﬁtability (board members are not 
included in our primary analyses unless they are also employees)

● L2—Senior vice presidents and other similar roles: senior leaders of 
the organization with signiﬁcant business unit or functional oversight 

Companies opted in to the study in response to invitations from McKinsey 
& Company and LeanIn.Org or by indicating interest through our public 
website. Participation in the Employee Experience Survey was encouraged, but 
optional. 

● L3—Vice presidents and other similar roles: leaders within the 

organization, responsible for activities/initiatives within a subunit of a 
business unit or function, or who report directly to senior vice 
presidents 

All talent pipeline data collection occurred between May and July 2023. Talent 
pipeline data reﬂect representation of men and women as of December 31, 
2022, as well as personnel changes (e.g., due to promotion, hiring, attrition) 
during 2022. Therefore, all talent pipeline data do not represent any changes 
that occurred during 2023. In July 2023, 52 companies also submitted 
optional “H1” data on their talent pipeline representation and personnel 
changes for the ﬁrst half of 2023. 

Human resource leaders and professionals provided information on policies, 
programs, and priorities on behalf of their company between June and 
September 2023. Additionally, employees were surveyed on their workplace 
experiences between June and August 2023. These datasets represent 
point-in-time snapshots and reﬂect companies’ responses and employees’ 
experiences at the time the survey was taken.

● L4—Directors: seasoned managers and contributors, with 

responsibility for multiple teams and discrete functions or operating 
units 

● L5—Managers: junior managers and contributors, responsible for 

small teams and/or functional units or operations 

● L6—Entry level: employees responsible for carrying out discrete tasks 
and participating on teams, typically in an oﬃce or corporate setting 
(ﬁeld employees like cashiers or customer service representatives are 
not included in our primary talent pipeline analyses)

47  |  WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE: METHODOLOGY

Methodology

TALENT PIPELINE

Metrics and Analytics 

Talent pipeline data included the representation of men and women 
(overall, in line versus staﬀ roles, by race/ethnicity, and optionally for 
functional roles like marketing, sales, and engineering). In addition, 
companies reported the number of men and women who were hired, 
promoted, and who left the company (overall, by race/ethnicity, and 
optionally for functional roles like marketing, sales, and engineering 
roles, as well as optionally for voluntarily versus involuntarily leaving).

Promotion and attrition rates were calculated for women and men, 
overall and by race/ethnicity, at each level. Promotion rates were 
calculated by dividing the number of promotions of that gender into a 
level by the number of employees of that gender in the level below at 
the start of the year. Attrition rates were calculated by dividing the 
number of each gender who left the company at a given level by the 
number of employees of that gender in that level at the start of the year. 
Submitted data were checked for consistency and inconsistent data 
were excluded as needed.

EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE SURVEY AND ANALYTICS 

Survey Participation 

More than 27,000 employees from 33 organizations elected to 
participate in the Employee Experience Survey. The survey questions 
covered multiple themes (e.g., overall satisfaction, ﬂexibility and 
remote/hybrid workplaces, advancement, employee well-being, equity, 
mentorship, sponsorship) as well as demographic questions (e.g., 
gender, gender of primary manager, race/ethnicity, age, disability, sexual 
orientation, role, family status, household characteristics, and 
responsibilities).

Bivariate and Multivariate Statistical Reporting 

Survey results were reported as an unweighted polled average of 
responses across companies. Many of the questions oﬀered a ﬁve-point 
labeled response scale (e.g., “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”). 
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, analyses aggregated the top two and 
bottom two boxes of the response scale (e.g., combining “Somewhat 
agree” and “Strongly agree”).

Where we highlight diﬀerences between genders or other groups, we 
highlight only those diﬀerences that are substantial and reliable. To that 
end, all diﬀerences noted in this report are statistically signiﬁcant to a 95 
percent conﬁdence level and/or reﬂect a diﬀerence of at least ﬁve 
percentage points between two groups unless otherwise indicated.

● Deﬁnition of Remote Work Status Composite Variable 

Participants were asked how often they currently work on-site 
and were given interval-level responses as options. During the 
data analysis, the ﬁve options were transformed into the following 
variables:

○ Remote: Never, or less than one day a week on-site

○ Hybrid: 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, or 4 days a week on-site 

○ On-site: 5 days a week on-site

HR PROGRAMS AND POLICIES

Human resource professionals from two hundred seventy-four 
organizations provided information on gender diversity policies and 
programs on behalf of their organization. We report the percentage of 
organizations that have a program, policy, priority, or position out of the 
total number of companies that submitted HR program/policy data. 

QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS

We conducted individual interviews with 38 women, men, and nonbinary 
employees across multiple industries. Interviewees were volunteers 
selected to reﬂect a range of levels, departments, and demographic 
groups. Our interviews focused on workplace experiences to gain a 
deeper understanding of the quantitative ﬁndings from the employee 
survey. Individual names, company names, and any other identifying 
information were kept strictly conﬁdential, and individuals are anonymized 
in this report. Within the quotes, some identifying details may have been 
altered and/or withheld to protect the speaker’s anonymity. Quotes have 
been edited for clarity.

HR AND DEI BEST PRACTICES

DEI best practices are based on a top performer analysis conducted with 
pipeline data and HR survey data. This is supplemented by external 
research, past Women in the Workplace studies, and responses from 
subject matter experts about what has been most eﬀective in improving 
representation and advancement of women. 

We used talent pipeline data from 271 companies that participated in both 
the Talent Pipeline and HR Surveys in 2023 to identify organizations that 
outperform representation of women and women of color metrics. We 
compared their total women and women of color representation for L1 to 
L6 to their industry’s average for these values. We then ranked the 
companies by the extent to which they outperformed this year’s industry 
benchmarks for total women and women of color representation from L1 
to L6 in the pipeline to identify the top quartile of companies.

The key HR practices and policies that drive progress were based on the 
top performer analysis and were deﬁned as practices where there was a 
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the percentage of top performing 
organizations (n = 69) and non–top performing organizations (n = 202) 
that have adopted that practice. In cases where recommendations 
included multiple individual practices (e.g., sponsorship and/or mentorship 
programs for women and women of color), the recommendation was 
classiﬁed as a signiﬁcant practice if there was at least one statistically 
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between top performers and all other companies in 
the analyses for any of the listed practices. To further inform solutions, we 
conducted additional deep-dive analyses for theme-related top performer 
groups, including assessing what practices are adopted signiﬁcantly more 
by organizations that have managed to promote women to the manager 
level at more similar rates to men and by organizations that had lower 
voluntary attrition than their industry average.

20  “Psychological safety” is the belief among employees that it’s safe to take interpersonal risks. It means employees believe they won’t be punished or 
humiliated if they propose new ideas, raise concerns and issues, or admit mistakes. Amy Edmondson, “Psychological Safety and Learning Behavior in 
Work Teams,” Administrative Science Quarterly 44, no. 2 (June 1999): 350–83, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2666999. 

21  In addition to “self-shielding,” social scientists describing similar dynamics have used terms such as “impression management,” “self-monitoring,” 
“stigma management,” “vigilance,” “emotional tax,” and “performative contortions.”

22  In this study, “women who experience microaggressions and self-shield” are being compared to women who do not experience either.

professional; You toned down what you said because you didn’t want to be seen as unlikable (e.g., chose your words carefully); You hid important aspects 
of your identity to ﬁt in at work (e.g., being LGBTQ+, having a disability); You felt like you had to “code-switch” to blend in with others at work (e.g., changing 
mannerisms, tone of voice, or speaking style); You chose not to speak up or share an opinion so you didn’t seem diﬃcult or aggressive; You felt like you
