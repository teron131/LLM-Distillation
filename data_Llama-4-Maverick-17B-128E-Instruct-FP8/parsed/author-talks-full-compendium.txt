David Fubini on hidden 
truths for CEOs

In his new book, David Fubini provides a behind-the-scenes look at what it 
takes to be a superior leader.

4

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey Global Publishing Director Raju 
Narisetti chatted with David Fubini, former senior 
partner at McKinsey & Company, in anticipation of 
the release of his new book, Hidden Truths: What 
Leaders Need to Hear But Are Rarely Told (Wiley, 
December 2020). In the book, the accomplished 
Harvard Business School faculty member offers 
exclusive insights about C-suite jobs that provide 
aspiring leaders with practical, new skills that  
will equip them for the immense challenges they  
may confront.

And I found it unusual that there wasn’t really an 
understanding of the basic realities of what the day-
to-day was of CEOs. The second was when I would 
go to CEOs and say, “Here’s what I take away from 
our conversation. I think this is important.” They 
would say, “It’s incredibly important. By the way, that 
never happened to me because I was a better leader 
than that.” But other leaders need to hear that. And 
of course, I know from my own consulting 
experience, in many cases, they had experienced 
that which I was describing to them. 

What problem were you trying to solve with  
this book? 
The book originates largely from three sort of major 
motivations. The first was I was teaching lots of 
executives and, at the end of the sessions, many of 
them would come to me and say, “I learned so much 
from case examples and the Socratic conversations. 
Is there something written that would help us 
memorialize the things that we’re learning?” And I 
was unable to find any really good books. I thought, 
maybe there’s an opportunity here.

The second is I went and I looked at leadership 
books, and there are many, many written by CEOs. 
But those tend to be biographical and lofty in terms 
of the major learnings that they’re trying to convey. 
And I was thinking, I really want something day to 
day—what it really feels like to be a leader. And then, 
finally, Harvard came to me and said, “It would be 
great if you could write something, because this is a 
topic we really think CEOs—and other leaders—
would find valuable.”

What surprised you most about writing this book—
in the research, writing, or response? 
What was most surprising to me was how surprising 
CEOs found the things that I was conveying back to 
them as a potential table of contents and ideas—
about what they experience, day in and day out, 
about these various elements of what it really means 
to be a new CEO, and about how much they thought 
it would be helpful for this to be conveyed to others.

Do your due diligence

How can new leaders balance the need to react 
quickly with the need to get it right? 
There’s a huge challenge now because there is an 
expectation that CEOs will arrive, as I said in the 
book, prepared, and that that’s because there is 
such limited time and patience among boards, 
analysts, and other constituencies that they’re 
having to deal with.

And I think this really calls on them to actually do an 
enormous amount of homework that many CEOs, as 
they came into their roles, often have not done. This 
is something that’s really new learning for CEOs. 
Indeed, one of the CEOs I interviewed who had been 
remarkably successful at his transition—and I asked 
what the underpinnings of it was—would talk about 
how he very consciously viewed this as a due-
diligence exercise akin to buying a large company.

He had to actually secure a lot of information from a 
wide variety of sources. He actively sought to get 
consultative help, even in advance of getting into the 
company, because he wanted to arrive with a 
strategic plan. He’d gone to investment bankers who 
were friendly to him to ask, “How would this be 
greeted by Wall Street?”

Leadership and organization

‘In order to be a good CEO, you have to 
be a good strategist. You have to make 
disciplined trade-offs, and you have to 
know both the positive and the negative 
to make those trade-offs.’

This is the type of due diligence that is unusual for 
others—when they were just interviewing—to have 
done. Now, it’s become a standard. Because if they 
don’t do that, they won’t be able to arrive with an 
actual plan. Now that plan obviously, like all plans, 
has to get modified by the reactions that it 
engenders. But the point is, you have to have a plan.

What can boards do to ease the transition of 
incoming leaders and set them up for success? 
I think there’s a lot boards could do to really help 
CEOs and other leaders transition. The first is, they 
have to be very crisp about what it is that they’re 
seeking in their leader. That job description, which 
often feels like boilerplate, really is much more 
meaningful than that.

It has to be: “Here’s the type of leader we are 
seeking.” So when they go and seek that person, 
they are all in common agreement so that the 
second thing can be achieved, which is a consensus 
around the board. Very often, you find the problems 
with transitions happen when the board, themselves, 
are not aligned around what they want from the CEO 
they’ve just hired. You really have to have boards 
aligned around what they’re seeking.

And then, finally, expectation management. What 
they want to have happen and when they want it to 
happen has to be agreed upon as well. Because if 
new CEOs come in and they have a different 
expectation around timing and expectations (as they 
often do) from the board, conflict immediately 

emerges. So those are the things that boards  
really have to do a better job at, even before they 
hire a CEO.

Arrive with a plan

What are some of the things new CEOs find 
surprising after they begin their tenure? 
I would spotlight three things as the biggest 
surprises and blind spots for CEOs. One is the 
importance of arriving with a plan and with a team. I 
think a lot of CEOs think that they can just arrive and 
they’ll have a grace period, which, often they find, 
even if they did have a plan and a team, they’d be 
overwhelmed by the sheer volume of constituencies 
and challenges that they have to actually deal with. 
And they never had time to really go back and get a 
plan for what they wanted to do. 

The second is the belief that they get told the entire 
truth by their management teams. In order to be a 
good CEO, you have to be a good strategist. You 
have to make disciplined trade-offs, and you have to 
know both the positive and the negative to make 
those trade-offs.

It’s surprising how often CEOs are not told the entire 
negative truth of things, because there is such a 
desire of their management teams to tell them only 
the good. So, many CEOs get surprised by the fact 
that they don’t hear the negative.

Author Talks: The collectionThe challenge is, “Hey, I’ve never been a CEO, and 
I’m writing about what it means to be a CEO.” I 
reached out to a great friend, Larry Culp, who is a 
very prominent CEO—both in his previous life and 
now—to write the foreword, for him to say, “There  
is some usefulness here, because I, as a CEO, see 
that value.”

You come from a family of eminent thinkers. Tell 
us about that and what meaning this book holds 
for you in that context.  
Let me be very clear. My grandfather was a world-
class mathematician. My father was a world-class 
engineer and the former chief scientist at IBM. I am 
not of that caliber. I am not somebody who has  
that intellect.

What I have is the experience of having worked 
alongside of and as a counselor to many leaders. 
This book was my way of contributing back, in some 
ways, in the same vein that my much more 
intrinsically gifted father and grandfather did in their 
own ways. This is at least my attempt to contribute 
something back, much like they did, either through 
formulas or through technology.

And finally, I think it’s also a big surprise to lots of 
CEOs how lonely the job can be. I know that sounds 
counterintuitive but, really, suddenly CEOs are cut 
off from a lot of their fundamental mentorship and 
groups of people that they used to deal with when 
they weren’t in the most top job in the company. 
Once you’re in the top job, you really don’t have 
access to some of those people and staffs that you 
used to. And it really does get lonely pretty quickly.

What were some of the challenges—and 
advantages—of having an outsider’s perspective 
on the CEO experience? 
The challenges were reduced by the fact that there 
are just lots of observational points after one has a 
34- or 35-year career in McKinsey. You have lots of 
observations. That gives you, immediately, a 
hypothesis for what you should actually think about 
writing in the context of hidden truths for CEOs.

The second is that you have an opportunity to talk to 
lots of CEOs. And this is a thing that CEOs love to 
talk about, because it’s the reality of their jobs. In my 
interviews with them, I would ask, “Tell me what you 
wish you knew before you took the job that you 
didn’t know.”

They would go on and on about all the things they 
wish they had known. It was a wonderful way for 
them to contribute back through me to others that 
will follow in their footsteps.

Hubert Joly on 
unleashing human magic

The former chairman and CEO of Best Buy describes the leadership 
principles required to thrive in capitalism’s next era.

8

Author Talks: The collectionIn anticipation of the release of his new book, 
McKinsey Global Publishing’s Tom Fleming talked 
with Hubert Joly, former chairman and CEO of Best 
Buy and currently a senior lecturer of business 
administration at Harvard Business School. In the 
book, The Heart of Business: Leadership 
Principles for the Next Era of Capitalism (Harvard 
Business Review Press, May 2021), Joly (an 
alumnus of McKinsey’s Paris and New York offices) 
highlights the leadership principles that fueled 
Best Buy’s resurgence and describes his own 
quest to become a more authentic, vulnerable, and 
human leader. An edited version of the 
conversation follows.

What problem were you trying to solve with  
this book?
The world is clearly facing a multifaceted crisis, 
whether it’s the health crisis, economic crisis, 
social-justice crisis, the environment, and so forth.

And what’s the definition of madness? Doing  
the same thing and hoping for a different outcome. 
For 40 years, we’ve been following a model that 
was based on two sources of inspiration: 
[conservative economist] Milton Friedman’s 
“primacy of shareholders” and Bob McNamara’s1 
[principle of] “use your brain to get the right answer, 
and then tell people what to do.”  

Clearly, this has gotten us into trouble. And so I 
felt—before the COVID-19 crisis, of course, but 
even more so now—that we need an urgent 
refoundation of business and capitalism around 
purpose and humanity. To find new ways for all of 
us to lead so that we can create a better future, a 
more sustainable future.

how hard this is, and how all of us are on a journey 
to become better.

My main driver in writing this book was not to tell 
the world that “I’ve got it; I’ve figured it out.” I did 
feel, though, that much of what I learned when I 
was at business school or in my early years as an 
executive is either wrong, dated, or incomplete.

And so I wanted to provide a guide to leaders at  
all levels who are eager to abandon old ways  
and are keen to lead from a place of purpose, and 
with humanity.

What do you say to leaders who think that 
concepts like purpose—and leading with 
humanity—are “squishy”?
The image of profits and the image of the leader as 
a superhero able to save the day, and the leader 
driven by power, fame, glory, or money—that’s still 
a very strong image. I see it in some of my peers. 
I’m teaching at Harvard now, and I see it at 
business school. But the approach has limitations.

Take incentives. There’s research that shows that 
financial incentives deteriorate performance. If I ask, 
“When you get up in the morning, do you think about 
your day as, ‘How am I going to optimize my year-end 
bonus today?’” Of course not. Motivation is primarily 
intrinsic: “How does what I’m doing connect with my 
search for meaning?” And if companies can connect 
the individual search for meaning with the purpose of 
the company, then magic happens.

Don’t get me wrong. Shareholders are really 
important; I care deeply about shareholders. 
They’re going to take care of our retirements, so 
you want to make sure that they do well [laughs].

What surprised you most about writing the book—
whether in the research or response?
The greatest surprise or delight is just how widely 
held this view is—that leading with purpose and 
humanity is the way to go. And yet at the same time 

But people are the source, they’re the engine of 
any organization. We also know that we have to 
take care of our employees, our customers, our 
business partners, and the community. Best Buy is

headquartered in Minneapolis. When the city is on 
fire, you cannot run a business. If the planet is on 
fire, you cannot run a business. 

The child had gotten a tiny dinosaur toy as a gift. 
And the bad news is, the head is disconnected; the 
dinosaur is not in good shape.

In the book, you call for a new way to manage and 
lead—an approach you call “unleashing human 
magic.” What do you mean by that?
As we think through how we move forward with 
business and capitalism, it requires us to rethink 
things. One is to rethink our view of work. Work is 
sometimes seen as a curse, as something we do so 
that we can do something else that’s more fun.

I have a different view. I love the Lebanese poet 
Kahlil Gibran, who said, “Work is love made visible.” 
Work can be part of our calling, part of our search 
for meaning, why we exist. And I think in the heart 
of every individual, there’s a desire to do good 
things in the world.

The second thing is how we think about companies. 
Do we see them as money-producing machines? 
Or do we see them as human organizations made of 
individuals working together in pursuit of a goal? 
And in most people’s lives, their greatest desire is 
not how much money they’re going to make, or 
[how quickly] they make VP [vice president] or 
something like this, it’s the Golden Rule. If you can 
create this environment where there’s connection 
of purpose and people can be themselves, then 
magic happens.

What does this look like in practice?
Let me give you an example. A mother comes into 
one of our [Best Buy] stores with her young child. 

The child would like the dinosaur to be cured, so 
they go to Best Buy. In the old days, [they] would 
have been shunted to the toy aisle to get a new 
dinosaur. But two associates in that store saw the 
situation, understood it at a very human level, took 
the dinosaur, and went behind the counter to 
perform a “surgical procedure” on the dinosaur.

And they walked the child step by step through the 
procedure—substituting, of course, the dinosaur 
with a new one—and they gave the child a “cured” 
dinosaur. Now, close your eyes and imagine the joy 
of the child and mother.

Do you think there was a standard operating 
procedure at Best Buy on how to deal with a sick 
dinosaur? Or a memo from me, the CEO, to 
everybody: “When you see a sick dinosaur, this is 
what you’re going to do”? These associates found 
it in their hearts to create joy in this little boy. And 
they felt that they had the freedom to do that.

That’s our role as leaders, to create this 
environment. 

How did you come to the view of leadership you 
describe in the book?
There were a number of milestones in the last 
30 years that helped me become—hopefully—a 
better leader. [One important] moment for me was my 
midlife crisis. I had gotten to “the top.” I had been a 

‘I love the Lebanese poet Kahlil Gibran, 
who said, “Work is love made visible.” 
Work can be part of our calling, part of 
our search for meaning, why we exist.’

partner at McKinsey; I was a member of the executive 
team at Vivendi Universal. And when I got to the top of 
that “first mountain”—I felt emptiness. I had worked 
so hard; I’d been successful. There was nothing there.

As a leader, we need to spend time with ourselves. 
In my case, I did the spiritual exercises of Ignatius 
of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits, to revisit my 
life and try to discern my calling in life, my purpose. 
And for me, my purpose is to try to make a positive 
difference on the people around me and use the 
platform I have to make a positive difference in  
the world.

When I got to Best Buy, it struck me. Even during 
the turnaround, when we were supposed to sink  
[as a company], and after a gathering of all our 
store GMs [general managers], where we 
discussed the way forward, the feedback I got  
at the end of the day wasn’t: “Oh, my God. Your  
plan is so great, so compelling, so smart.” [The 
feedback] was: “You gave me hope”; it’s how I made 
them feel.

And that changes completely the view of the role of 
the leader. The view of the leader as the smartest 
person in the room, driven by power, fame, glory, 
and money; the superhero who is there to save the 
day. But that doesn’t work; that doesn’t connect 
with people. Leaders must create an environment in 
which others can blossom.

Also, they need to be very clear about who they 
serve. So I told all of the [corporate] officers at Best 
Buy: “Look, if you believe you’re here to serve 
yourself or your boss or me, as the CEO of the 
company, it’s OK. I don’t have a problem with that. 
Except you cannot work here. You can be promoted 
to being a Best Buy customer, which is a wonderful 
thing. But you cannot work here. On the other hand, 
if you’re here to serve people on the front line, then 
we’re good.”

Integrity is important, and so are values. As is being 
an authentic, vulnerable, very human leader—
which is the only way you can connect with others, 
opening up and connecting at a very personal level. 
And that’s been my journey.

Michael Useem on 
leading with an edge

How can leaders gain an elusive edge over competitors in a world turned 
upside down? Michael Useem draws lessons from ten executives to build a 
road map for mastering leadership.

12

Author Talks: The collectionEarlier this year, McKinsey Global Publishing’s 
director, Raju Narisetti, chatted with Michael Useem, 
the William and Jacalyn Egan Professor of 
Management at the University of Pennsylvania’s 
Wharton School, where he is also the director of the 
Center for Leadership and Change Management. In 
his new book, The Edge: How 10 CEOs Learned to 
Lead—and the Lessons for Us All (Wharton School 
Press, June 2021), Useem dissects the life and work 
of CEOs of major companies and chronicles how 
they approached decisions on everything from 
management and growth to hiring and the bottom 
line. An edited version of that conversation, focusing 
on key leaders mentioned in the book, follows.

Why do readers need this book now? 
I teach leadership here at the Wharton School of the 
University of Pennsylvania. It began to hit me a couple 
years ago that we absolutely need to think about a 
curriculum. The content that students are focused on 
when they’re here—content that’s going to prepare 
them to lead when they’re rising up at firms or 
agencies or whatever may be their future—and what 
they’re going to need five years out or 15 years out 
unequivocally is not going to be the same as it was 
this year or ten years ago.

And more specifically, what really got me into this, 
with a slightly different meaning, is the famous phrase 
from Marshall Goldsmith, the executive coach, who 
wrote a book called What Got You Here Won’t Get 
You There. That’s more focused on individuals who 
have some bad habits, for example. But the phrase, I 
think, captures a truth, as well: that if you are leading, 
for example, Vanguard Group now, it’s a different era 
from when Jack Bogle created the firm. If you’re 
leading GE now, it’s different from the era of Jack 
Welch. Our responsibility is, as university instructors, 
to get it right for the present and, even more 
importantly, for the future.

On Bill McNabb, former chairman and CEO  
of Vanguard: 
Bill McNab had a long run, and we’ve had many, many 
conversations. He described going back to when he 
took charge of Vanguard—just before Lehman failed, 

on September 15, back in 2008—and the global 
financial crisis followed. He said, “It just hit me. I can’t 
run this firm like Jack Brennan, my predecessor.”

On Mark Turner, former chairman at WSFS 
Financial Corporation: 
I’ve come to know him very well. He began to 
appreciate that financial technologies were just 
coming as an onslaught into his industry, not to 
mention that young customers wanted no more than 
20 seconds to open up an account. They didn’t want 
to talk to a teller. They didn’t want to set foot in a store. 
So to know what his successor—not to mention he 
himself in his final couple of years—ought to have in 
their own leadership repertoire, Mark Turner took a 
learning tour. Academics get that. We call it a 
sabbatical. It’s one of the privileges of our vocation. 
Rarely have I seen it in business. But he did this, just 
to make it more tangible.

He wrote a note to everybody saying, “Hey guys, 
I’m out of here for three months. Don’t call me 
unless it’s absolutely necessary. I’m not going to 
call in. But I’m going to go visit 49 companies, 
ranging from Apple to Walmart, to understand how 
technology may be changing.” So Mark Turner took 
a three-month learning tour, and it was extremely 
hard on him. He was on the road, in hotel rooms, for 
three months. When he would visit Walmart, for 
example, he spent a couple days with the former 
CEO there trying to understand what Walmart was 
doing to try to catch up with Amazon. Amazon, at 
that time, was purely online.

The question for Mark Turner was, is banking going to 
go totally digital? Is it going to get there halfway? Do 
we still have to have branch offices? With that 
sabbatical, that learning tour, three months in the 
field, he came back with some great answers to those 
questions. To sum it up—the story’s told in much more 
detail, obviously, in the book—he concluded, and this 
has been WSFS’s policy since then, that banking is 
fundamentally being changed by fintech. We all know 
that. On the other hand, at some points—say for a very 
complex home or business mortgage—you actually 
want to talk with a trusted adviser, maybe on the

phone, maybe in an office. So tech, he concluded, 
was going to come in. He had to make the changes. 
He had to find savings by closing offices so he could 
invest in new technologies. 

turn the place upside down and culturally redirect. 
Now the majority of sales would no longer come out 
of department stores at the cosmetics counter. They 
wanted to lead in a world that has to be led differently. 

But the point I want to conclude with is this: here 
was a person who was thinking about his successor, 
who was going to be enabled, in part by what 
happened on this learning tour, to take charge in a 
different era and lead fundamentally differently. So 
Mark led the way. It’s like pouring concrete—putting 
down the sidewalk for the new person to walk on 
and leading in a world that was now more than half 
fintech and not just old banking. 

On William Lauder, executive chairman of The 
Estée Lauder Companies: 
The Estée Lauder Companies, as it’s known, is one of 
the world’s largest luxury fragrance companies. 
William Lauder, who I’ve spent a lot of time with, is the 
heir, third generation, of what’s still a family-
controlled company. He said to himself when he was 
chief executive, “I know we’re going to have to 
become more nimble, less dependent on the 
cosmetics counters on the first floors of large 
department stores. We’ve got to get online. We’ve got 
to sell in China. And airports in Sri Lanka. In my own 
experience—I grew up in a company that didn’t want 
to do those things—I know we have to move, but I 
don’t have the wherewithal to get my senior staff to 
move with me.”

In an unusual move he said, “I need a comrade in arms. 
Somebody who understands retail, high-end retail 
like me, who is not burdened by a past history or 
cultural blinders that come from growing up in a 
company.” So he turned to a person named Fabrizio 
Freda, who had been at Procter & Gamble. He said, 
“Fabrizio, I’d love to have you come in now as the COO.” 
William Lauder at the time was CEO. “And if things go 
well, I’m going to move myself up to be executive chair 
of the board.”

The resistance in Estée Lauder Companies was pretty 
strong in making that change. So here was a person 
who was willing to work in collaboration. It’s a genuine 
partnership to effect the changes that he could not 
make himself. He’s done that, and he’s brought Estée 
Lauder, with great success, into this decade. It took a 
decade to make it happen, but it’s happened.

On Tricia Griffith, CEO and president of 
Progressive:  
Tricia Griffith, who had gone to work for Progressive a 
long time ago as a claims adjuster, would go out to 
meet customers who had a car or a truck damaged 
and try to work up what the insurance company ought 
to be paying out as a result. She rose through the 
ranks, did everything very well, and became chief 
executive—and by the way, three years ago was 
named by Fortune magazine as the CEO of the year. 
Not bad for an insurance company. Most people don’t 
know a whole lot about it.

In part, though, and this was the headline as Fortune 
put it, Progressive was growing faster than Google 
or Apple. In the long-standing “big boss” model—
think, Jack Welch at GE—he or she commands; 
everybody else salutes and does. But Tricia Griffith 
took a different kind of leadership to such a refined 
state that it put her as number one on the front of 
Fortune magazine. That’s because the big-boss 
model does not work with a new generation of 
employees or American cultural habits any longer. 
For instance, when I went to visit the headquarters, I 
was invited to tag along as she was meeting a group 
of new recruits. Progressive hires like crazy because 
they’re growing so fast—some 40,000 employees 
were there at the time I was there, and they’re hiring 
7,000 to 8,000 a year. 

The two of them have worked as a partnership—an 
unusual combination: executive chair and a CEO 
joined at the hip to make changes, to make waves, to 

The custom is to stride to the front, get up on a 
platform, and tell everybody about the vision for the 
company and how important our strategy is. But 

14

Author Talks: The collectionwhen Tricia walks into a room with newly hired 
employees, she does what a great politician does: 
she’ll start shaking hands from the get-go. So these 
young people, mainly newly hired, are looking three 
feet away and there is the CEO. They’ve seen her on 
television. They’ve seen her in the annual report. But 
there she is saying, “Where were you working before? 
How many kids do you have?” That kind of personal 
touch. Tricia Griffith came to the front. There was no 
riser. There was no stage. She did have a microphone. 
It was a big room. 

She just began to tell everybody a little bit about her 
life. She went to a state school in Ohio. She came up 
through the ranks. She was a claims adjuster. But she 
began to put up her hand along the way and say, “You 
know, I’ve never done HR, human resources, and I’d 
love to have a swing at what happens there. I’d love to 
take a look at how we invest our monies, since people 
paid in for the insurance and the money sits there, 
sometimes for decades—I’d love to know about our 
investment strategy and portfolio.” 

And as a result of that, she came to learn about 
various functions. But she also learned that to be up 
on a pedestal was to underlead people who were 
working there. People want to know you value them. 
You’re willing to come down with them and not stand 
on high above them. So she is my exemplar beyond 
the big-boss paradigm, which would have worked ten 
years ago at many companies. In fact, most. But in the 
next ten to 15 years, it’s not going to have the traction 
that it once had.

On Alex Gorsky, chairman and CEO of Johnson & 
Johnson: 
He came up, literally, from the lowest rung and now 
has the highest rung at a company that has about 
140,000 employees. He came all the way up. And this 
is, to me, so indicative or symptomatic of what 
anybody with more than five employees ought to be 
thinking about. When he began at the bottom, nobody 
reported to him. And when he had three people 
reporting to him, he could tell them what to do or give 
them coaching. But when it’s 140,000 far-flung 
employees around the world, in some 200 separate 
operating units, he doesn’t see most of them, ever.

He does try to get out and about, obviously. So he 
doubled down on the famous Johnson & Johnson 
credo: 300 words that 75 years ago defined what a 
descendant of the original Johnson brothers said was 
vital for a company. “We have to make products that 
people want. We have to treat our employees fairly. 
We have to work with the community.” The last 
paragraph, which is quite notable, says, “And if things 
go well, we’re going to treat our shareholders well, 
too.” Almost the inversion of the usual emphasis on 
total shareholder returns. So those are the values. But 
Alex Gorsky doesn’t see a whole lot of those folks 
who are producing everything from shampoo to, now, 
COVID-19 vaccine and hip replacements.

Gorsky concluded that since this company is growing, 
he’s going to have to double down but make the 
culture of the firm stronger. The culture is that 
medium, that invisible ether, which communicates 
indirectly the values and what he ultimately wants 
people to be doing when they come to work in the 
morning. Cultures get tired, though. He quickly 
recognized that. The wording is often out of date. 
There were, for example, some references that were 
gender specific, which is inappropriate in our era. 
There wasn’t enough in there about the role of 
everybody helping to lead the firm, not just passively 
accepting the orders that are given to them.

It took a year, with lots of discussions and lots of 
testing, to adjust the words. Not a whole lot of words 
were needed for that culture, that definition of the J&J 
culture, to become contemporary, not tired and not a 
cause for people to say, “This doesn’t speak to me. I 
don’t understand what this is all about.” Culture is a 
tool if we can use it well. That’s going to be the calling 
of leaders in the future.

On Denise Ramos, former CEO and president  
of ITT: 
Denise Ramos is really interesting because she’s, in a 
sense, the inheritor of one of America’s most famous 
companies. Some years ago, ITT became the poster 
child for the diversified conglomerate. It made 
telephones; it harvested forest products; it had an 
auto-rental company; it made Twinkies. How’s that for 

Michael Useem on leading with an edge

‘Culture is a tool if we can use it well. 
That’s going to be the calling of leaders 
in the future.’ 

diversified? That’s kind of historic now. We don’t have 
a whole lot of those left in the US. Other countries do, 
of course, but it’s a vanishing breed in the US. In part 
that’s because investors can’t understand them, don’t 
know how to price the stock and all that. 

Denise Ramos, with an MBA in finance from the 
University of Chicago, worked for several other 
companies. She worked her way up in the finance 
function. She became chief financial officer of one of 
the more recent reincarnations of ITT. It was, however, 
still very diverse. The board and CEO at the time 
decided to break up ITT, which had already been 
broken up several times, to cast off three “children” 
that were “pure plays.” One CEO was going to be 
replaced by three. The board chair at ITT, when she 
was still chief financial officer, said, “Denise, we’d like 
you to become CEO of one of the three spin-offs.”

It turned out to be the most difficult one, by far, to 
manage. She did understand that at the outset. 
Denise said, “Well, why me? I’m in finance. I know how 
to collect a lot of money and then make certain we 
count everything at the end of the day correctly and 
report to the financial markets.” The chair of the 
board said, “Denise, you’re the kind of person we 
think is going to be essential in this coming era 
because you have been ‘CEO before you have been 
CEO.’” You have to listen to that carefully. “You’re CEO 
before you’re CEO.” 

What he meant, obviously, was that she, as chief 
financial officer, had met with the board, or sat down 
with the chief executive, and explained not only 
everything there was to know about what was 
creating value and destroying value but also what you 
ought to do with the free cash that you now had. 
Should we acquire? Should we build a new plant? 
Should we open up in Taiwan? Those are leadership 
decisions for the CEO. And—correctly, I think—the 
chair of that board said, “Look, Denise, you’re already 
thinking like a CEO. You’re thinking about everything.”

That gets to the bigger point I would take from this, 
which is that people in the future who are moving into 
leadership—not even necessarily toward the very top, 
but the rungs along the way—have to be specialists. 
That’s what got you promoted in engineering, finance, 
operations, maybe marketing. But then to lead the 
enterprise, there are too many moving parts for you 
not to appreciate them all. So you have to learn how to 
work with the mayor of your community. You have to 
learn, for example, what’s happening to people who 
are now unable to come to work and are dealing with 
families shut at home with COVID-19.

From her experience, and watching her up close, I 
think the board chair’s statement was perfect for 
what’s going to be required in the future. Whatever 
your leadership rank or rung, whatever you’re leading, 
you really have to think like a CEO. One day you may 

16

Author Talks: The collectionbecome CEO. What that signifies more broadly for me 
is that you’ve got to think about everything, from how 
teams work to why people want to come to work.

On Bo Ilsoe, partner, NGP Capital: 
Bo Ilsoe took responsibility for a company that was 
making the lenses that provide photographic images 
in smartphones. We all carry a smartphone these 
days. We’re all taking photographs like crazy. This was 
one of the premier makers, around the world, for the 
tiny lenses that had to reproduce great detail on the 
sensors inside. 

He came into this venture-capital firm after the VC 
had already made its investment in this company. But 
the VC was coming to realize that this company was 
on the verge of going off a cliff for a lot of reasons, 
including the fact that it was hit with the 2008–09 
global financial crisis. Bo Ilsoe spent a lot of time 
doing his due diligence on what was the problem. Was 
it the product? Was it the market? Was it the 
strategy? Or was it the person who ran the darn 
thing? 

His conclusion was that the problem was not the 
strategy, not the quality or engineering of the product, 
and not the market, which was coming back two years 
after the global financial crisis, but the person who 
ran the enterprise. The person looked good on paper, 
but was not fully good. So Bo Ilsoe said, “My 
recommendation to the other partners is that we 
bring in a new person who has the complete 
leadership-talent set—not just two or three 
capacities, but all the capacities.” This meant 
understanding the engineering, understanding why 
people are staying there and not quitting, 
understanding the HR side, understanding how to 
work with big customers like Apple and beyond. He 
found somebody that fit the bill. The person came in 
and, lo and behold, turned the company around.

A couple of years later, it was sold at an enormous 
price as the world unequivocally came to depend on 
those tiny little lenses in the back of mobile phones. 
The big point there for me, to wrap it up, is that in the 
era we’re in, we do have to look carefully at the 
leaders we are working for or, if we’re on the board, 

ensure that they have the complete skill set required 
to lead now. And with the explosion—of smartphones, 
in this particular case—you want a person who can 
scale. One month, you get an order for 500,000 
lenses; next month, you might have an order for two 
million. Can you scale? Can you market? 

The question, I think, comes down to this: What is the 
leadership we’re going to need in the years ahead? 
What are the defining qualities? I develop about a 
dozen in the book. They don’t replace the traditional 
qualities—being strategic, an effective communicator, 
decisive in decision making. But these new qualities, I 
think, are really helping to define a new era. And I 
think we’re all going to need them in spades to do well 
in the days ahead.

On Edward D. Breen, executive chairman  
of DuPont: 
Ed Brain is someone who many people will know as 
the person who turned around Tyco International. 
Speaking of crisis, Tyco International, then run by a 
person named Dennis Kozlowski, had a CFO named 
Mark Swartz. As the company grew from nothing, the 
two of them did 900 acquisitions over a decade. It 
was like an acquisition almost every week for nine 
years. They built an enormous enterprise. Kozlowski 
was then seen as the next Jack Welch, and he even 
styled himself as the next Jack Welch. He was on the 
front of a couple magazines as “The Next Jack Welch.”

Unfortunately, though, for everybody—employees, 
customers, suppliers, the board of directors, 
investors, and lenders—Mark Swartz, CFO, and 
Dennis Kozlowski, CEO, managed to steal, and I use 
that that term advisedly, about $500 million from the 
firm for personal, inappropriate purposes, such as a 
$3 million party for Dennis Kozlowski’s wife in 
Sardinia. The company paid for that, a purely personal 
event. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz spent a 
number of years in state prison in the state of New 
York. Meanwhile, Ed Breen came in. He had been 
number two at Motorola and, boy, was he challenged.

He took over the company in the especially hot 
summer of 2002, literally an hour after there was a 
rumor the company was going to go bankrupt. Enron

had just gone bankrupt. WorldCom had just gone 
bankrupt. And Tyco looked like it was heading for the 
same dust heap. Ed Breen came in, and in one of the 
most sweeping remakes ever in American business 
history turned the company around. Its stock was so 
low that the market value of the company was getting 
close to zero. It was almost indicted. And he turned it 
around. The story line on his turning it around is really 
interesting. 

Later on, he was invited in as an outside member of 
the board of directors at DuPont. This sometimes 
does happen: to become chief executive officer, to go 
from the board that picks the CEO to be the CEO. 
Informed by his time at Tyco, he quickly figured out 
that because of changes in the chemical and 
agricultural-product market, DuPont was now 
becoming a diversified conglomerate. So was Dow. 
So he and the Dow CEO sat down pretty quickly and 
decided to merge those two firms, the two best 
chemical and agricultural-product makers in America. 
Then—and this was all part of the plan—as soon as 
the companies were merged, they divided the 
company into three pure plays. Here’s the point I want 
to make: Ed Breen learned how to take a struggling 
company and break it up several times into 
enterprises that were more market-worthy when they 
were in more narrowly defined market areas. 

I think one of the great dangers out there is that we’re 
looking back on what we know, what wisdom we’ve 
had, to inform our next move. But Ed Breen took a 
totally different view of how to solve the problems at 
Tyco versus DuPont. At Tyco, for example, he fired, 
literally, within a year, 290 of the 300 top people. 
When he came to DuPont, he did his due diligence 
and he said, “They’re great. It’s just a misguided 
structure in this modern age.” So the point is to 
remember that we are a product of our history. 
There’s a whole academic field called path 
dependency. We do now what we learned to do five 
years ago. Ed Breen broke that tendency and said, 
“I’ve now got to remake DuPont,” and he did that very 
successfully in collaboration with the people at Dow.

On Jeffrey Robert Lurie, owner, Philadelphia 
Eagles (National Football League): 
Jeffrey Lurie, owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, for 
many years was determined to take his team into the 
Super Bowl. And of course, the Eagles ended up in 
the Super Bowl a couple years ago and managed to 
pull off the miracle. It was an unexpected comeback 
in the final minutes with what became known as the 
Philly Philly Play, in which a person who had never 
thrown a pass threw a pass to the quarterback, who 
took it in for the extra points.

Jeff Lurie had been trying to achieve that moment, 
which is going to define his life forever, of a Super 
Bowl win, but with people who weren’t going to deliver 
it to him. He replaced coaches. He tried various 
measures. But finally, to his great credit, he put 
together a combination of three parts. The underlying 
point in leadership is that one thing won’t do it. Your 
height. Your gender. Your charisma. Your eloquence in 
front of people. Your strategic thinking. You need it all. 

Jeff Lurie, believing you could learn a lot as a coach 
from players, developed a three-part formula. First, 
he made certain that he had a coach who was player-
centric. It took him a while to get the right guy to do 
that. Number two, he concluded that the back office 
was part of the story. If the back office was 
dysfunctional, players on the field were not going to 
be able to play and demonstrate their best. Finally, 
you’re not going to win in a field of 34 teams if you’re 
not willing to take a few risks. Jeff Lurie said, “I want a 
coach who is player-centric.” And then, separately, “I 
want the back office.” By the way, these are big 
offices. They open the stadium and they do the 
payroll and they ultimately decide who’s going to be 
on the field as decision makers in that area. So he 
wanted that to be in place. 

He had to develop a mindset among the coach, the 
players, and the back office: a willingness to take 
risks and not be fired for them. It took a while to 
achieve that risk tolerance, risk willingness. But he 
put that together with a united inner circle of top 

18

Author Talks: The collectionpeople, around the whole enterprise, who weren’t 
players. Then the coach and players learned from 
each other. Voilà, they had an amazing Super Bowl. 

On George Washington: 
I finish off with a chapter on no less a person than 
George Washington, not known for his business 
experience but, rather, more for his experience in 
creating the country. And just to remind listeners, he 
went through either fourth or fifth grade before he 
dropped out. He never went to a military academy; 
there wasn’t one at the time. No ROTC.  He had not 
been in the ranks for 20 to 25 years to become a 

general officer, the way it is now in the US, but he put 
up his hand. The Continental Congress said, “George, 
you’re the guy. Why don’t you take charge of what 
we’ll call the Continental Army and see if you can’t get 
the British out of North America?” It took him seven 
years. He learned it all from scratch. 

So here is my final case in point: this is all learnable. 
There’s nothing secret here. We just have to find out 
what’s vital. It’s out there. Then we have to put up our 
hands and decide to become the leader we know the 
nation or the company or the community really needs.

Dambisa Moyo on how  
boards can work better

In her new book, Dambisa Moyo explores the role of corporate boards in 
the 21st century and how they need to adapt to greater demands.

20

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey’s Astrid Sandoval chatted with global 
economist and board member of several large global 
organizations, Dambisa Moyo, about her new book, 
How Boards Work: And How They Can Work Better in 
a Chaotic World (Basic Books, 2021). Moyo offers a 
primer on the role that  boards play and the growing 
challenges they face to meet greater social and 
cultural demands. An edited excerpt of the 
conversation follows.  

Why this book and why now? 
I joined my first board just over ten years ago, and 
the truth is in many ways, I did not embody the 
conventional board member. I was 39 years old and 
relatively young compared to the average board age. 
I’m Black. I’m from Africa, and I’m a woman. The 
other aspect, which was really crucial, is I didn’t 
come from the C-suite. Very often, boards are 
looking for people who have had tremendous 
experience as CEOs or CFOs of large, global, and 
complex organizations. In that respect, the chairmen 
of the different companies of whose boards I joined 
were really taking a chance on me. 

Since then, I have had a decade of incredible 
experiences. I have had the trauma of a CEO 
chairman dying while in the office. I’ve had a company 
get taken over for $100 billion in 2016, the largest 
transaction of that year. I’ve had activists in a stock 
where I was on the board, which can be incredibly 
disruptive. I’ve had to fire a number of CEOs, very 
often, though not all the time, but very often for 
ethical infringements. And I’ve also had a situation 
where we’ve had a stock price go from nearly $60 
down to $7 and generate a lot of concern that the 
company wouldn’t survive. Thankfully, I can assure 
you that the company is still around. 

So it’s been a wild ride for ten years. I’ve learned a 
tremendous amount and been very grateful for the 
opportunity. But it has really refined my thinking 
about how complex organizations are and how we 
need everyone at the table—government, corpor-
ations, and civil society—in order to solve some of the 
biggest challenges that the world faces today.

What problem were you trying to solve with  
this book? 
I was trying to solve two problems. The first problem 
is a macro problem on what the role of corporations 
is and should be in the 21st century. The book talks 
about the challenges that boards and corporations 
face in trying to recalibrate and reassert the 
importance of corporations at a time when there are 
greater demands on what the board and the 
corporate mandate actually are. 

The second problem I address in this book is the lack 
of information on what exactly the board does. And 
this was true, and became very clear to me in 
conversations with students in MBA classes, 
employees at the companies where I serve on the 
board, and also, more generally, with friends and 
family. There was a negative narrative about boards 
being described as a group of people who just 
played golf and drank fine wines. I wanted to be very 
clear on not only what the mandate is, but also to 
explain why it’s so difficult and challenging to do a 
lot of things that people think should be easy and 
straightforward, such as firing a CEO or 
implementing some of the big ESG [environmental, 
social, and governance] agenda questions that are 
very pervasive these days.

What surprised you most about writing this book—
in the research, writing, or response?  
The really surprising thing for me was trying to 
articulate the trade-offs that board members and 
corporations face on a day-to-day basis. There is 
definitely a sense out there in speaking to people 
that boards and corporations are not aligned with 
societal needs and that boards have a relatively easy 
job in terms of dictating what the responsibilities of 
the company should be. Trying to bring people along 
to help them understand this is actually a very 
complicated, very difficult job, which is fraught with 
mistakes and a lot at risk, was an area that was  
quite surprising.

Dambisa Moyo on how boards can work better

Leadership and organization

Winning in all environments 

Even before the pandemic, we have been living in 
what feels like a more chaotic world. How has 
that affected boards? 
It is absolutely true that a world of more digitization 
and greater pressure from social demands is making 
it much more challenging for boards to think about 
their mandates and how to navigate corporations 
through these challenged periods. However, and I 
think COVID-19 is a great example of this, the best 
corporations are managing their businesses, and by 
that I mean in terms of foundational aspects of 
having good controls, strong balance sheets, and 
well-run operations in terms of people, operational 
staff, et cetera. Those aspects, when they are 
bedded down, will work regardless of the broader 
economic environment.

diversity. Having people with different perspec-
tives—whether it’s from geopolitical and public-
policy backgrounds, academe, and scientists—
bringing those into the boardroom so that it doesn’t 
just reflect businesspeople is clearly something that 
I believe is beneficial to the organization.

The best corporations will continue to think about 
adding diverse voices and perspectives to the 
boardroom. It is also patently clear to me that you 
want the boardroom to be at least 40 percent 
populated by people who have been in the CEO seat 
previously. What is clear is that CEOs of large, 
complex, global organizations, in particular, need to 
be able to find counsel, support, and objective 
perspectives from people who have essentially been 
in that specific role and seat before. 

One of my CEOs often uses the term “winning in all 
environments,” and I like that because we don’t 
know what challenges—whether they’re economic, 
macroeconomic, a pandemic, or geopolitical—may 
emerge. But our responsibility as a board, and as 
senior business leaders, is to make sure that we 
have not only risk-mitigated in the way companies 
run, but also are constantly making sure that 
regardless of what gets thrown at us, the companies 
can continue to operate.

How important is it to have a diversity of 
perspectives in the boardroom, particularly 
during a crisis?  
It is clear that it’s not just about racial diversity or 
gender diversity but also the broader lens of 

Know your mandate

What is one piece of advice you would give 
existing board members and those considering 
joining a board for the first time?  
One of the things I would say to existing board 
members is that we shouldn’t flatter ourselves. Other 
boards before us have had, I would argue, even 
greater challenges. Think for a moment about trying 
to run a business during the middle of a civil war, or 
indeed World War I and World War II. That would 
have been incredibly challenging. We are in a 
challenged environment, but I’m very optimistic that 
we can actually do something that will continue to 
drive better business over a longer period of time. 

‘It is absolutely true that a world of more 
digitization and greater pressure from 
social demands is making it much more 
challenging for boards.’ 

22

Author Talks: The collection 
 
‘When joining a board, you’re joining in 
the middle of a movie. Boards have 
existed for a long time. There’s a lot of 
scope for improvement.’  

The third role of the board is this cultural frontier, 
which I separate into two parts in the book: The part 
about nonnegotiables, things like excellence, 
professionalism, and the new cultural-frontier 
aspect, are much more challenged and have a whole 
array of trade-offs associated with them. 

When joining a board, you’re joining in the middle of 
a movie. Boards have existed for a long time. There’s 
a lot of scope for improvement, but fundamentally 
there’s an important role that boards have played, do 
play, and will continue to play. And the best new 
board members are those that bring fresh 
perspectives but also understand the subtlety and 
the more nuanced challenges that corporations and 
boards face.

With respect to new board members, I think the 
salient point here is for them to understand the 
mandate of the board and the levers that boards 
have in order to effect change. The mandate of the 
board has three key aspects. One is to oversee the 
strategy of the company, and we do this by having a 
full-on strategy day. It’s usually two or three days. 
But also we do that through regular short-, medium-, 
and long-term strategy planning.  

The second is to hire or, in some instances, fire the 
CEO. This is a very important aspect because the 
relationship between the CEO and the board is 
critical, and the CEO defines the cultural aspects of 
how a company operates. Traditionally, boards focus 
on financial, operational, and past experiences. But 
we also need much more perspective on the ethical 
history of CEOs as we think about them as 
candidates. We have a lot responsibility and a great 
opportunity to effect change in the organization by 
who we hire, but also through compensation. And 
more and more, I’m pleased to see that many boards 
are now adding social aspects that contribute to 
compensation.

Two Stanford faculty members explain why we need more humor at work. 

24

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey executive editor Roberta Fusaro spoke 
with Stanford Graduate School of Business faculty 
members Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas 
about their book, Humor, Seriously: Why Humor Is a 
Secret Weapon in Business and Life (Currency, 
2021). Drawing on years of field research and 
classroom workshops, the authors explain the 
theory of humor—what it is, how it works, and why 
business leaders need it—without totally giving 
away the punchline. An edited version of the 
conversation follows.

What problem were you trying to solve  
with this book?
Naomi Bagdonas: The problem is that we working 
professionals have fallen off a humor cliff. This 
conclusion is based on research with over 1.4 million 
people, in 166 countries, who were asked a really 
simple question: “Did you smile or laugh a lot 
yesterday?” At age 16, 18, or 20, people are largely 
saying yes. At age 23, the answer quickly becomes 
no—and we don’t start laughing again until we retire. 
We go to work and we stop laughing. We asked 
ourselves, “How would our businesses and our lives 
change for the better if we had more joy at work?” 

More broadly, we wanted to understand how  
would our world change for the better if each of us 
navigated our lives on the precipice of a smile. 

How did you come to focus on the topic?
Naomi Bagdonas: The question and the problem 
were personal for me. For ten years, I spent my days 
climbing the corporate ranks, and by night I was 
doing improv and sketch comedy. I was leading a 
double life. I was doing really well at my job, but I was 
doing what brought me joy only on weekends. As  
a result, I was inauthentic at work, I wasn’t making 
close friends, and I felt like I was close to burnout.

Jennifer Aaker: I never prioritized humor. I enjoy 
laughing—which is hard to say without sounding like 
a sociopath—but I never really thought of humor as 
being something that was important. It wasn’t aligned 
with the goal I had for most of my career, which was 
to publish papers, do research, and teach. 

About eight years ago, I met Amit Gupta, an entre-
preneur who was diagnosed with leukemia and 
couldn’t find a match in the national bone-marrow 
registry. He used humor and levity to meet this

our world change for the better

challenge. To find matches, he planned BYOSA—
bring your own South Asian—parties in New York 
clubs. He asked comedians to do public-service 
announcements: Give a Spit About Cancer. In  
a short period of time, he found a match, and in the 
process he found matches for countless others.  
He survived. He’s very healthy now. And I went  
from thinking that humor was this superfluous thing 
to thinking that it was a secret weapon.

What surprised you in the writing, the research, 
or the reactions to the book?
Jennifer Aaker: One thing is just the ROI on humor. 
It has a substantive impact on many of the 
dependent variables that we look at from a business 
perspective. For example, leaders with a sense of 
humor—any sense of humor, not even a good sense 
of humor—are 27 percent more motivating and 
inspiring. Their employees are 15 percent more 
engaged when they work with them. And their teams 
are twice as creative as measured by having them 
solve a creativity challenge. 

If you don’t care about motivation, admiration, or 
creativity, you might enjoy knowing that humor will 
make you wealthier. One of our favorite studies 
showed that if you add a simple, light-hearted line to 
the end of a sales pitch—like “This is my final offer. 
And I’ll throw in my pet frog”—consumers are much 
more likely to go for it. That’s right, a bad dad joke 
can get you an 18 percent–higher price point. 

How do you know when and how to inject humor 
into a work situation?
Naomi Bagdonas: Part of it is realizing that humor 
at work is not really about being funny. It’s about 
being human and more connected to our colleagues. 
It’s not about what I say and whether people think 
I’m funny; it’s about how a joke will make people feel 
when it lands on them. Each of us has our own 
humor style. There are basically four humor styles—
the stand-up, the sweetheart, the sniper, and  
the magnet—and each of us is naturally inclined to 
one or two of them. And we can flex our styles  
based on context. 

Jennifer Aaker: The typology illuminates the natural 
risks that people feel or experience when they  
use humor at work. Stand-ups, for example, tend to 
tease others, almost as a sign that “I like you.” But 
that directness could hurt the feelings of those with 
different humor styles. Sweethearts may be more 
understated in their style of humor, but they’re often 
so focused on lifting others up that they can 
overindex on self-deprecation. At higher levels of 
status in an organization, self-deprecation is a really 
powerful tool. But at lower levels, it can actually 
boomerang. To use humor authentically at work, you 
need to understand not just your own humor style 
but that of your team. 

What happens if you bomb with your audience? 
Naomi Bagdonas: You never use humor again.

Jennifer Aaker: Ever.

Naomi Bagdonas: Ever. 

Jennifer Aaker: And then you die. Sorry, too dark? 
Did I go too dark?

Naomi Bagdonas: And that’s our book about  
humor, folks!

No, really—what happens if you bomb? 
Naomi Bagdonas: Humor failures are really 
nuanced. There are two kinds. The first is the benign 
humor fail, where your joke just doesn’t get a laugh. 
The second is when we use humor that crosses a line 
in some way that we’re not aware of. In this context, 
it can be really tempting to brush it off as the other 
person’s problem, right? But these are actually 
golden opportunities to acknowledge our mistakes 
and reflect on our blind spots.

There is a rule in comedy: never punch down. And 
that is true in the workplace, too. You never want to 
make fun of someone with lower status than you. 
This is particularly important for leaders because as 
we rise in the ranks of an organization, our playing 
field for humor changes. Senior leaders may

inspiring, their employees are

–Jennifer Aaker

recognize that while self-deprecation wasn’t a tool 
that they used very well early in their careers, it can 
now be a superpower in their current position.

It also goes without saying that humor is incredibly 
context dependent. Take a minute to read the room. 
A CEO walked into the room shortly after letting  
one of his senior leaders go and made an insensitive 
joke about her departure. He did it because he 
wanted to diffuse tension in the room. But if he had 
taken a moment to recognize what was really  
going on for him, and to have a moment of empathy 
for those in the room, he never would have  
made that joke. 

What if you’re not naturally funny—can you  
learn to be?
Jennifer Aaker: As someone who was voted the 
least funny person in my family by all five members, 
including the dog, I have an answer to that one— 
yes! Our research shows that humor is a learnable 
skill. We all have a sense of humor, and, using the 
humor typology, we can understand others’ sense of 
humor. We can learn how to be funny from others, 
especially comedians. The power of humor isn’t just 
in building bonds or sparking creativity or increasing 
status or even improving resilience and mental well-
being. It’s about finding a balance between gravity 
and levity and giving power to both.

Nicolai Tillisch on how to 
frame ambition (and not 
let it frame you)

Years of coaching leaders led to an ah-ha moment: ambition can  
undermine even the most successful people. The challenge is more complex 
than work–life balance. 

28

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey senior editor Barbara Tierney chatted 
with Nicolai Tillisch about his new book, Return on 
Ambition: A Radical Approach to Your Achievement, 
Growth, and Well-Being (Fast Company Press, 
January 2021). Tillisch, a McKinsey alumnus who 
now works with the global coaching firm Cultivating 
Leadership, talked about how seeing so many 
people struggle with achievement spurred him and 
his coauthor, Nicolai Chen Nielsen, to create a 
framework and tool kit to help them. He also spoke 
in personal terms about the limits of his own ambition. 
An edited version of the conversation follows. 

What problem are you trying to solve  
with this book?
The problem we focused on is that too many 
ambitious people are working really hard without 
becoming as successful as they could be or 
sacrificing much more of their fulfillment in life than 
they need to. 

We found that, actually, there’s a lot of doubt out 
there. There are indications that up to half—and in 
some cases well beyond half—of the people we 
consider ambitious actually doubt whether the effort 
they are making is worth it. They struggle to keep 
everything together in their lives.

For me personally, I came into the research because 
I was looking at how I could help people perform. 
And then suddenly a whole picture opened up—that 
this is not just about performance. It really is holistic: 
you can achieve, but if you don’t have growth and 
well-being at the same time, it will be really difficult. 

What is the core concept behind “return on 
ambition” and how can you measure it?
The book defines ambition as a powerful yearning and 
drive to attain a future state that is different from 
today’s and challenging to reach. And that’s relevant 
for most ambitious people. So this book can be  
read by somebody who just joined the firm, and it 
can be read by somebody who is well into their 
career. The way we measure this is that we simply 
have a formula: return on ambition equals 

achievement plus growth plus well-being. And all 
three factors are vital.

Also, each element impacts the others. They are 
interdependent. So what we saw, and it’s actually 
quite beautiful, is that when we interviewed people 
we considered to be successful over time and also 
assessed them as having fulfilling life, one of the very 
clear patterns is that they nurture all three factors—
achievement, growth, and well-being—on an ongoing 
basis. On the other hand, we found so many 
examples, and also a ton of research, indicating that 
if you compromise on one of the three for a long 
period of time, then you will hurt the two others.

Making a choice

What are the seven “frenemies” of  
ambitious people?
The seven frenemies double as the virtues of 
ambitious people. They are competitiveness, desire, 
perseverance, boldness, independence, convention, 
and flexibility. And what we have seen is that  
most ambitious people can recognize several of 
these in themselves. 

For me personally, I have a very close relationship with 
perseverance and competitiveness. Going all the  
way back to school and academia, I would never have 
gotten to where I am had it not been for these friends. 
But down the line, they also started dominating  
me quite a lot, and it was very exhausting for me and 
also for my colleagues. And in hindsight, I sacrificed 
way too much with my family and friends.

So what is very clear is that these two particular 
frenemies—perseverance and competitiveness—
have increasingly managed me. And the moment  
I became aware of this, I took the conscious choice 
to, basically, overrule my instincts and follow  
my intuition. You might say that my normal thought 
patterns, my behavioral habits, are not supporting 
what I’m trying to do now. And that’s a huge  
shift. But it’s possible.

29

Personal development

‘ It was very exhausting for me and also 
for my colleagues. And in hindsight, I 
sacrificed way too much with my family 
and friends.’ 

Once you decide that ambition has created  
an imbalance in your life, how do you set  
a new target?
The big disease of ambitious people is that they try 
to do too much. They have too many goals or 
equivalents to goals. They spread themselves thin. 
So the book counters that by distinguishing 
between long-lasting principles, one short-term 
improvement priority, and weekly intentions.  
The book contains a dedicated tool for each of  
these three. 

It’s not only about setting a target but also learning 
from that target and expanding your future  
capacity. And you can make this exciting and pursue 
it in a way that you take good care of yourself. 

A big takeaway for leaders is how they think about 
their own ambitions and also the people who  
helped them achieve these ambitions. Because this 
is not just about those achievements. When you 
want people to do their absolute best over time,  
you need to pay attention not only to their 
achievements themself.

The biggest trend right now in work is to look not at 
employee satisfaction but at employee life satisfac-
tion. So you need to look at the whole picture. 

Of forests and trees

What surprised you most about writing this book?
As a McKinsey alumnus, I have some beautiful 
techniques in problem solving! And I must admit that 
while working on this book, I couldn’t see the forest 
for the trees many times. So we went through tons of 
scientific research to backstop our findings.

We conducted a big survey around the world.  
We interviewed a lot of people and did very deep 
interviews with a collection of very ambitious  
people. And we ended up reconceptualizing the 
book twice. We threw out hundreds of pages  
of draft manuscript.

So the big surprise for me is that this ended up being 
such a nice little elegant system, with one return-on-
ambition equation, seven frenemies, and four tools. 
So you can say the book didn’t end up actually being 
a forest, but much more of a well-composed 
baroque garden.

In anticipation of the release of his new book, 
McKinsey Global Publishing’s director Raju Narisetti 
chatted with Shankar Vedantam, the host of NPR’s 
Hidden Brain podcast. In Useful Delusions: The 
Power and Paradox of the Self-Deceiving Brain 
(W.W. Norton, March 2021), Vedantam and coauthor 
Bill Mesler argue that, paradoxically, self-deception— 
normally believed to do harm to us, to our 
communities, and to the planet—can also play a vital 
role in our success and well-being. An edited 
version of the conversation follows.

great suffering, we don’t often feel that it’s our job to 
tell them the exact truth.

When a friend comes up to you and says, “You know, 
I’m going through a divorce,” you don’t tell your 
friend, “Well, you’re going through a divorce 
because you were a terrible partner. Serves you 
right.” You tell your friend, “I’m really sorry for what’s 
happened to you. I’m sure that things are going to 
look up in the future. Let’s maybe sit down and talk 
about how we can make things better for you.”

Understanding self-deception

We’re all liars, aren’t we?
As I’ve written this book, I have noticed numerous 
cases in my own life when my behavior has deviated 
from rational choice. Let me give you a couple of 
examples. A few years ago, my dad was dying from 
lung cancer, and he was going downhill very quickly. 
And I would see him periodically every couple of 
months. And each time I saw him, he looked much 
sicker. He looked much worse than he did the 
previous time.

Now all of us have been in situations like this. We’ve 
seen people going through terminal illnesses. This is 
extraordinarily painful for the person who’s going 
through it and for the family as well. But my dad 
would eagerly ask me each time he saw me how I 
thought that he was doing.

And when he asked me that question, I invariably 
lied. I told him, “I think things look like they’re going 
pretty well. In many ways, things seem to be looking 
up and are going better than we could have 
anticipated. It sounds like you might [end up being] 
one of the lucky ones.”

Now someone could look at what I said and say, “You 
know, you’re a cruel, heartless person for lying to 
your dad.” But I think most of us in this situation 
would see that what I did was, in fact, a human thing 
to do. When we are speaking to people whom we 
love, whom we care about, and they’re experiencing 

That’s what makes you a good friend. One last 
example: some months ago, I was traveling away 
from my home when I started to experience a loss of 
vision in one eye. Now, I have a family history of 
retinal problems, and it turned out that I was 
suffering a retinal detachment.

For those who are not familiar with this, the retina  
is the screen behind the eye. It allows you to see, 
and so, when the retina comes off its hinges, you 
can essentially lose your vision altogether. Now I 
was very far from my home. I didn’t have doctors 
nearby. I eventually managed to find an eye doctor 
who very kindly opened his practice for me at  
9:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night. He diagnosed me  
with a retinal detachment, and he said, “You need to 
go into surgery in the next few minutes or you’re 
going to lose your eye.”

Now at that point, I didn’t have a chance to get a 
second opinion. I didn’t have a chance to look up 
reviews and see whether he was a good doctor or a 
bad doctor. I did what all of us do in a situation like 
this. When you’re drowning and someone throws 
you a lifeline, you don’t question that lifeline.

You grab onto that lifeline, you hold onto it, you 
believe in it. And that’s exactly what I did. I trusted 
the doctor. As it turned out, he was a brilliant 
surgeon. He ended up saving my eye, for which I’m 
profoundly grateful. But it reminded me that in that 
moment of great vulnerability, I did not respond with 
reason and logic.

32

Author Talks: The collectionI responded with trust and with faith. When we go 
through vulnerable times, we need to reach out to 
other people. When other people are going through 
vulnerable times, we need to reach out to them. In 
some ways, that idea is at the core idea of Useful 
Delusions—when we see the delusions of other 
people, it’s easy to sit in judgment of them. It’s easy 
to be contemptuous of them. But it is far more 
helpful and far wiser to be empathetic to them, to be 
compassionate, and to be curious about how it is 
they came to be thinking the way they do.

What were you hoping to accomplish with  
this book?
The problem that I was trying to address grew out of 
what I’ve seen for many years as a journalist. We in 
the news media have often covered various events, 
and we would present facts to the public. And very 
often, these facts would not have the effect that we 
thought they were going to have.

I’ll give you an example. During the four years of the 
Trump presidency, The Washington Post catalogued 
more than 30,000 lies and falsehoods that came 
out of the Trump White House. The net effect of all 
of this was that Donald Trump received 11 million 
more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016.

And examples like this prompted me to ask the 
question, “What exactly are facts doing? When we 
provide people with facts and information, are 

people actually processing the information the way 
we think they’re processing the information? Or is it 
in fact the case that their minds are shaping and 
filtering that information in all kinds of ways?” My 
book is trying to grapple with questions like these, 
about how the brain, in some ways, invents realities 
of its own—sometimes for good and sometimes for ill.

What surprised you when researching this topic?
The thing that surprised me most when researching 
the topic had to do with my own mind. I think of 
myself as being a deeply logical and rational person. 
And the idea that self-deception can ever be good 
for you is something that I find not only 
counterintuitive but also deeply disturbing.

I’ve spent much of my career trying to fight self-
deception, both in my own head as well as in the 
minds of the general public. And so, I was disturbed 
to find there are many, many domains where certain 
self-deceptions can be good for us.

I’m sure we’ll talk about some of these, but among 
them would be our personal relationships. It helps, 
for example, to have slightly delusional views about 
the people you love, your partner, your children, your 
parents. It helps to see them in a positive light. When 
we look at them through rose-tinted glasses, not 
only are we happier in those relationships, but those 
relationships are likely to last longer.

‘The brain, in some ways, invents  
realities of its own—sometimes for  
good and sometimes for ill.’

Personal development

The truth about lying

Should we aim to dismantle self-deception  
or embrace it?
There’s a question that’s often raised: Is self-
deception a bug or is it a feature? And the answer  
to that question really is, it’s both. Self-deceptions 
can help us lead more functional lives, but they can 
also lead us in very, very bad directions. 

When it comes to politics, for example, self-
deception can prompt us to believe the claims that 
politicians are making before an election, even when 
those claims are patently false. One way I think we 
can overcome and fight these self-deceptions is to 
practice what scientists call the scientific method—
to actually subject claims to rigorous analysis and to 
ask for evidence for the things that we believe. 

Now, very often, most of us are very good at asking 
our opponents to provide evidence for the things 
they believe. In other words, we use skepticism as a 
weapon, as a tool, to win arguments. One of the 
things I think you can do to dismantle self-deception 
in your own brain is to apply the tools of skepticism 
to yourself and to your own thinking.

The great physicist and scientist Richard Feynman 
said, “The first rule in science is that you must not 
fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.” 
And I think that is an important insight. All of us 
believe that other people are prone to self-
deception. The very nature of self-deception makes 
it very hard for us to see when we ourselves are  
its victims.

What role does self-deception play in  
the workplace?
One of the questions that’s sometimes asked of me 
is, “What are the implications in your book for 
business settings? Does it have implications for how 
companies should be run, for how transparent they 
should be?” And the answer to that question is yes.

Many of us believe—and for a long time, I believed 
this myself—that more transparency is always a 
good thing. That the more transparent we could be, 
the better things would be. And in general, I think 
that’s a good principle. But it is the case that in many, 
many dimensions of our lives, it actually is helpful to 
at least shade the truth a little bit.

Let me give you the simplest of examples. When we 
talk to one another in the workplace, it’s really 
important for us to be civil to one another, to be polite 
to one another, to phrase requests as requests rather 
than commands or orders. Now you could argue that, 
in some ways, this is a form of deception.

It would be more honest for the boss simply to tell the 
underling, “Go out and do this,” rather than say, 
“Would you have a couple of minutes to help me with a 
favor that I need?” But the reason we do this, and the 
reason we speak in these indirect ways, is because 
it’s been shown that the politeness, courtesies, and 
kindnesses we show one another in the workplace 
are really vital to the success of workplaces.

But what about when it comes to transparency on 
other fronts? For example, should we simply make 
everyone’s salary transparent to have a more 
egalitarian workplace? The state of California tried 
to do just that some time ago. Reporters unearthed 
the salaries of all the public employees in the state 
of California and made it public.

And their goal was laudable. Their goal was to say, 
“Let’s have more transparency in terms of showing 
who makes how much money.” The net effect of this, 
however, was very, very sad. Many of the people who 
were very good employees saw that there were 
other employees who were making more than them, 
and they thought these other employees were not 
as good as them. And they felt undervalued. These 
employees became more likely to quit. 

34

Author Talks: The collectionThis intervention, which began with laudable goals,  
ended up driving many of the people who were the 
best workers out of the organization—which, in this 
case, was the state of California—and ended up 
keeping in place the people who were the best 
compensated but not necessarily the best workers. 
It’s another small example of how, even though it 
might seem, superficially, that some amount of 
opaqueness is bad, it might actually be the case that 
some amount of opaqueness is actually good for us.

Self-deception in the service of good

How do we harness self-deception to address, 
say, climate change?
So before we think about the good that self-
deception can do in the world, it’s worth looking at 
how self-deception just operates in the world as it is. 
For example, I’m a sports fan, and every January, 
when the NFL playoffs are going on, I watch teams 
playing in –10° weather in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

And when you look in the stands, there’re always 
those five people who are standing there without 
wearing any shirts in that weather. And snow is 
falling on them, and they have their team colors 
written on their chests.

And you have to ask yourself, what is prompting 
these people to pursue their fandom of the team 
with such maniacal focus? Surely, it’s a form of self-
deception? A team, after all, is just a business that 
happens to be located in your town. The players who 
are playing for your team are not even from your 
town. They’ve actually been imported from all over 
different places, and yet you’re willing to stand in the 
freezing cold with your shirt off so that you can 
demonstrate your loyalty to the team.

The reason I mention this is that in many ways, I think 
we need to leverage the capacity of the human mind 
to form deep, tribal loyalties and direct those tribal 
loyalties in the service of goals that are much more 
important than your local football team.

So take the problem of climate change. At an 
individual level, each of us might come out ahead if we 
drive more, if we fly more, if we burn more fossil fuels. 
We might come out narrowly ahead, but the collective 
as a whole, the planet as a whole, might pay a price. 
And so, there is a mismatch between the incentives 
here, because at an individual level, I am not 
personally incentivized to care about climate change.

That’s precisely the kind of problem that religions 
may have come into existence to solve—where you 
have mass problems, where people need to 
collectively take some action, where I need to look 
out not just for my personal self-interest but for the 
collective interest.

And religion, in some ways, can help us see that 
fighting climate change is not just a cost-benefit 
equation, the way that we typically talk about it; it 
needs to be a sacred value. We need to have the 
same relationship to fighting the climate as those 
fans in Green Bay have toward their sports team.

We need to have the same fervor, the same passion. 
And I would argue that what we should be doing is 
harnessing the capacity of the brain for self-
deception in the service of these laudable goals.

How can organizations get their employees to  
do their best?
So one of the things that companies often have to 
grapple with when it comes to encouraging people 
to do their best is to ask, “What conditions will 
prompt people to put their best foot forward?” For 
example, some researchers found that positive 
illusions are useful in helping people deal with the 
challenges they encounter in the workplace.

So, let’s say I were to join McKinsey tomorrow, and I 
discover during my first month at McKinsey that I 
encounter all kinds of problems. Now, this is normal. 
You would expect that somebody who joins the 
company for the first time is going to encounter all 
kinds of problems.

Personal development

‘When [people feel that they belong  
in an organization] and then they  
encounter setbacks, they’re more  
likely to weather those setbacks and 
more likely to move forward.’

But if I am not blessed with a certain amount of self-
confidence, I might interpret those problems as a 
signal that tells me, “I don’t belong at McKinsey. 
People like me do not belong at McKinsey. I am an 
imposter; I should not be here.” And I might draw the 
wrong conclusion that the best answer for me is to 
leave the company.

For many companies, McKinsey being one of them 
but hardly the only one, many people who are women 
and minorities often experience this when they enter 
workplaces. They see very few other people who 
look like them, and so when they encounter setbacks 
in the workplace or at a university when they join, 
they often misinterpret those signals to mean that 
they don’t belong in that workplace.

Many years ago, the researcher Greg Walton at 
Stanford University conducted a very interesting 
experiment. He brought in African American first-
year students at Stanford, and he asked them to 
come up with a little intervention.

He asked them to write little articles where they 
describe what it was like in their first year of college, 
the kind of setbacks and obstacles they faced, and 
how those setbacks and obstacles turned out to be 

transient. And what he was trying to do was to tell 
these people that, “Yes, you faced setbacks. Maybe 
you got a bad grade or maybe you didn’t get along 
with a professor. Maybe you didn’t have friends, and 
you felt lonely.”

But it turned out that these problems were, in fact, 
transient problems. Everyone in their first year of 
college goes through some version of these 
problems. When he eventually tracked the 
performance of these students over the course of 
the next four years, he found that these students 
significantly outperformed students who had not 
been through this intervention.

In other words, being reminded that these setbacks 
are transient is very useful. Another way to think 
about this is that you want to instill a certain sense of 
self-confidence in people, a certain sense of 
positive illusions.

You want to give people the belief that they belong 
at your organization. They belong at your university. 
When they have that belief and then they encounter 
setbacks, they’re more likely to weather those 
setbacks and more likely to move forward.

Personal development

McKinsey’s Raju Narisetti chatted with Kristin Neff 
about her new book, Fierce Self-Compassion: How 
Women Can Harness Kindness to Speak Up, Claim 
Their Power and Thrive (Harper Wave, June 2021). 
Neff, a pioneer in the field of self-compassion 
research, presents ideas that expand the notion of 
self-kindness and its capacity to transform lives. An 
edited version of the conversation follows.

On being a ferociously compassionate mess:  
Life is messy, right? The human condition is an 
imperfect one. And one of my favorite quotes is that 
“the goal of practice is simply to be a compassionate 
mess.”1  In other words, that should be the aim of our 
life: to be compassionate mess. So there are really 
two ways we can show ourselves compassion. 
There’s tender self-compassion, and there’s fierce 
self-compassion. 

Tender self-compassion is the ability for us just to be 
with ourselves as we are—in all our messiness, in all 
our brokenness, in all our imperfection—and also to 
be open to the pain of life. When we do that with 
compassion, it makes a huge difference in our ability 
to cope. Yes, we can’t always get it right, and life’s 
certainly not going to always go right for us. But 
when we can hold our pain and our struggle and our 
difficulty with compassion, it gives us the emotional 
resources we need to really survive and get through.

But it’s not just tender self-compassion we need get 
through the mess of life. We also need fierce self-
compassion. In other words, we don’t want to just be 
complacent about this mess called life. We also want 
to do what we can to change things for the better, 
not only inside ourselves, but also outside of us. Part 
of fierce self-compassion is fighting for justice, 
drawing boundaries, motivating change. This is also 
a really important part of compassion as we wade 
through the mess of life. The main theme of the book 
is that we need to balance this fierce and tender 
approach to ourselves and our lives in order to be 
ultimately strong and resilient and effective.

Unleashing our fierce side

Is the challenge self-compassion or fierceness? 
My research shows that the vast majority of people 
are significantly kinder and more compassionate  
to others than they are to themselves. For women, 
it’s 86 percent, and for men, it’s 67 percent. It’s 
especially hard for a woman because women are 
really socialized to be kind and giving to others and 
not necessarily themselves. There’s good news and 
bad news in that. 

The bad news is, most of us aren’t in the habit of 
being compassionate to ourselves, so it is a little bit 
difficult. It comes quite naturally to us when we’re 
compassionate to our friends, when our friends 
need our support. Many of us haven’t even thought 
about the fact that we can show ourselves the same 
kindness, care, and concern as we show those  
we care about. 

But the good news is, it’s actually not that difficult to 
be self-compassionate. Yeah, it may feel a little bit 
weird. It may feel a little awkward. Maybe it feels a 
little phony at first. But we already know how to do  
it. We already have the template and the well-
developed skills to know how to be warm, 
supportive, and encouraging, how to use 
constructive criticism. So all we really need to  
do is give ourselves permission to make a U-turn 
and learn to treat ourselves the same way. 

It’s not hard. It’s more about some of the blocks that 
stand in the way. For instance, we think that if we’re 
kind to ourselves, we’re going to be lazy and self-
indulgent and lose our motivation or become weak. 
And again, the research shows it’s the exact opposite. 
The kinder we are, the stronger, the more motivated 
we’ll be, and the more we’re able to give to others. So 
it’s really just a mind shift that we need to make.

I knew all the benefits self-compassion gave us. But 
with this book, part of what I wanted to do is talk 
about how self-compassion can be used in realms

Author Talks: The collection‘[People] don’t like angry women,  
which disempowers us because anger—
when it’s harnessed for good, when it’s 
harnessed for alleviating suffering—is 
an important aspect of self-compassion.’

that maybe we haven’t thought about so much. And 
one of the most important realms that this book is 
really predicated on is the ability of self-compassion 
to help women, in particular, reclaim their fierce side. 
Unfortunately, gender-role socialization makes it 
hard for a woman to be as fierce as we may need to 
be in certain situations: to stand up for ourselves or 
to draw boundaries. People don’t really like fierce 
women. They especially don’t like angry women, 
which disempowers us because anger—when it’s 
harnessed for good, when it’s harnessed for 
alleviating suffering—is an important aspect of  
self-compassion. 

I started talking to women about the role that fierce 
self-compassion played in their lives or just the role 
of fierceness in their lives. And I was really surprised 
by how many women said that they absolutely 
needed permission to develop their fierce sides. Just 
understanding that we can frame fierceness—even 
anger, drawing boundaries, meeting our own needs, 
as opposed to continually giving them up for others—
as an aspect of compassion makes a huge difference 
for women in our ability to reclaim this fierce side of 
ourselves. And I was really touched by how much 
women shared in terms of the ability of owning their 
fierceness [meant they] had to really change their 
lives.

On practicing “gender judo” at work: 
In the book, I quote some research by a professor at 
UC Hastings Law, Joan Williams, who talks about 

the need for women to practice what she calls 
“gender judo.” Judo is a martial art where you 
basically have to use your opponent’s momentum to 
defend yourself in order to make sure that you don’t 
get knocked over. And she argues that women have 
to do this in terms of balancing how we express the 
different sides of our nature at work.

Women aren’t allowed to be fierce. Gender-role 
socialization shows that women are supposed to  
be tender and nurturing—and not fierce. The 
research on women’s success at work is really quite 
disheartening. You have to be competent and kind 
of fierce and stand up for yourself and your ideas in 
the workplace.

People don’t like women who are too competent or 
who stand up for their ideas, because they assume 
that a competent woman isn’t nurturing, and we like 
nurturing women. And unfortunately, one of 
negative consequences of that is, women aren’t 
promoted as much or paid as much, because of this 
perception that a competent woman—which she 
needs to be to succeed—is not likable. And so we 
tend not to promote or pay unlikable people as much, 
in general. 

What Joan Williams argues is that one way women 
can overcome this is by practicing balancing our 
fierce and tender sides. So when you promote 
yourself, you maybe say, “Yes, I have had this great 
accomplishment; these are my successes,” which is 
needed to get a salary raise. But then you combine

Personal development

it with something very personal, maybe praising 
someone else at work: “This other person did such  
a great job as well.” If we’re just too tender at work 
without any fierceness, people won’t think we’re 
good at what we do. But if we’re too good at what we 
do without being tender, people won’t like us. And 
so, yes, it’s practical. It makes sense. But in a way, 
it’s just kind of heartbreaking that we have to do this. 

Men don’t have to worry about balancing their fierce 
and tender sides at work. They can be strong. They 
can be angry. People like them for it. They think 
they’re competent. Men don’t have to use part of 
their working memory space to always be thinking, 
“How are people judging me?” or “Was that too 
assertive?” And women do. It’s sad, but it’s true. For 
a woman, that’s why tender self-compassion is good. 
We need to honor the pain of it. We need to honor 
the pain that we can’t really be our full, true selves at 
work. We have to constantly manage these gender-
role expectations.

One of my hopes for this book is that more and more 
women really learn to own both their fierce and their 
tender sides and are able to express them more 
authentically. And maybe—eventually, in our 
granddaughters’ generation—they won’t have to 
worry so much about consciously battling gender-
role stereotypes.

Bringing balance to the workplace

Are there lessons for men and organizations here?  
The book is written for women, primarily, to help 
them honor their fierceness and bring it into balance 
with their tenderness, even though that goes 
contrary to gender-role socialization. So it’s 
especially helpful for women. But the idea of 
balancing fierceness and tenderness is useful for  
all people, regardless of your gender identity. And 
it’s especially useful in work contexts. 
You can also call it “agency” and “communion”— 
in other words, the kind of go-getter mindset, 
conquer-things mindset, with the accepting, friendly, 
more emotionally sensitive mindset. We know from 
the research that balancing those is good for all 
people. For instance, leaders who can combine 
both—who can show emotional sensitivity, 
emotional intelligence, in the workplace in addition 
to being very strong and competent—are considered 
more effective leaders.

People like leaders who can balance the fierceness 
and tenderness more. So when you can be honest 
about, for instance, dealing productively with your 
failure instead of just beating yourself up and 
shaming yourself for your failure, if you can be 
vulnerable and open to that failure, that’s actually 
going to allow you to learn and grow from your failure.

‘We need to honor the pain that [women] 
can’t really be our full, true selves at 
work. We have to constantly manage 
these gender-role expectations.’

Author Talks: The collectionThe balance of fierceness and tenderness is good for 
everyone in the workplace. Research shows that 
people who can be their whole selves in the 
workplace and treat themselves with kindness and 
support are less stressed on the job. They’re less 
likely to suffer burnout. There are lower levels of 
turnover, for instance. People are more productive. 

These two sides of our nature are really important for 
all people. And they are important in any context—
whether it’s due to just the culture of work and 
business or gender-role socialization in particular—
that makes us only half human, that doesn’t allow us 

to draw on every side of us. That includes the 
strength that comes from emotional tenderness and 
vulnerability and kindness and also the strength that 
comes from this fierce, competent, powerful—as I 
like to call it, “mama bear”—energy.

One of the reasons I think this book would be useful 
for anyone is because I have a lot of practices in it. 
And these practices are relevant for anyone, whether 
you’re a man or a woman, whether you’re a leader, 
whether you’re an employee. It’s really about being 
the most complete and effective human being we 
can be.

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey Global Publishing’s director Raju 
Narisetti chatted with poet Maggie Smith about 
the messages leaders can take from her latest 
book, Keep Moving (Simon & Schuster, 2020). In 
her collection of poems and essays, the bestselling 
author celebrates the beauty and strength on the 
other side of loss. An edited version of the 
conversation follows.

How can leaders be authoritative while 
maintaining a beginner’s sense of openness  
and curiosity?  
It’s funny. I think being a parent, in some ways, has 
prepared me for this duality. Because I would 
argue it’s a balance and that it’s important, even as 
an authority—whether it’s with your children, or in 
your workplace, or both. It’s important to maintain 
beginner’s mind and openness as much as 
possible, even as you rely on your experience and 
your authority.

I think we’ve all probably been in workplaces where 
someone has said, “But that’s the way we’ve always 
done it,” as an excuse not to make a change, when 
a change was probably necessary or would be 
helpful. And it makes sense. Because change is 
uncomfortable, right? We often resist it, because 
it’s uncomfortable. And, frankly, uncertainty, not 
having all the answers, is uncomfortable. It feels so 
much better to be confident when you know 
everything. But we don’t. And in a professional 
setting, it’s important to value expertise and 

experience. But it’s also important to value 
adaptability and flexibility and innovation and 
imagination and all of those things that make us 
able to change our minds, maybe, and take in and 
process new information without relying on the way 
we’ve always done it.

Think like a kid

How can people be more creative in their  
daily lives?
In the arts and in our professional lives and in our 
personal lives, newness, innovation only happens 
through experimentation and play. You can’t get to 
it without trying something and maybe falling flat 
on your face. You have to be willing to fail. And so I 
think part of what we need to do, as adults, is learn 
to be more like children in that we’re willing to try 
things and not worry so much about our egos, not 
worry about failing, and thinking that that’s going 
to reflect poorly upon us.

In order to have or make any breakthrough—
personal or professional—we have to put ourselves 
out on a limb. And it won’t always work, and that’s 
OK. One of the ways that I’ve kept myself from 
getting too stodgy about things is by trying to 
spend time with young people and glean as much 
as I can from their open and curious worldview. But 
I also think there are other ways to access that. And 
part of it is finding things that bring us joy and 

‘In order to have or make any 
breakthrough—personal or 
professional—we have to put ourselves 
out on a limb.’

making room to do those things in our daily lives, 
whether it’s reading, or meditation, or running, or 
dancing. Whatever the thing is that makes you feel 
alive, I think we need to carve out space for that. 
Because it will help us get to that mindset.

did not know, when I was writing this book, that it 
would be released during a global pandemic. And 
what I’ve been hearing from people, again and 
again, is how the book feels just right for this 
moment, which I could not have anticipated.

What problem are you trying to solve with  
this book?
I think the problem I was trying to solve was a 
problem of my own, so not a problem for the reader, 
so to speak, but a problem in my own life. As I 
began the project, I was writing notes to self every 
day, these sort of self-pep talks, and posting them.

But indeed, I think we are all facing our own “what-
now” life crises right now, whether it’s work-related 
or family-related or health-related, due, in large part, 
to the pandemic. And so the book coming out this 
year, honestly, feels like just the right time and not 
something I could have or would have planned for.

And the problem I was facing was really a problem 
of perspective, which is, what do I do now? How do 
I keep moving forward in my life? How do I face the 
future with courage and positivity, even though 
things seem really dark and difficult right now?

It was the end of my marriage. I was trying to 
regroup. And so I was writing for myself. The 
strange thing that happened was that, then, people 
responded. And my hope is that, now that the book 
is out, I’ve been seeing people say that they are 
buying it for their friends. And they’re buying it for 
their staff or their neighbors. My hope is that it 
might find someone who had the problem I had 
when I wrote it, which is to say, they don’t know 
what’s coming next for them. And maybe they’re 
feeling fearful or insecure or worried. Maybe the 
book will provide some reassurance or comfort or a 
little shot of hope when they need it. And frankly, I 
think we all need that right now.

The pandemic time warp

What is the most interesting thing you’ve learned 
from somebody else’s book recently?
I am rereading a book called The Order of Time by 
Carlo Rovelli. I wanted to return to this book, 
because it’s about time. And this year, because of 
the pandemic, I think we have, at least I have, a 
feeling that time’s gotten distorted, because of all 
of this time that we have alone. And so I went back 
to this book.

In a certain section, he’s talking about heat, which 
he calls, “the microscopic agitation of molecules.” I 
love that, as a phrase. And he writes, “Every time a 
difference is manifested between the past and the 
future, heat is involved,” which blows my mind. 
“Thoughts, for instance, unfold from the past to the 
future, not vice versa. And in fact, thinking 
produces heat in our heads.” I love that.

What surprised you most about writing  
this book?
I think the level of response to the book has been 
really surprising to me, because it started out as a 
project that was literal self-help. I wrote the book 
to help myself. So, to have so many people 
responding to it has been really surprising. Also, I 

Speaking of the concept of time, what does the 
future mean to you?
I wrote a poem that appears in my last book, Good 
Bones, about how the future is empty. It was 
inspired by a question that my daughter, Violet, 
asked me in the car when she was three years old. 
And her question was, “What is the future?” The 
poem is called “Future.”

Denise Woods on the 
power of voice 

In her new book, voice and dialect coach Denise Woods offers tools  
to help readers articulate clearly, become powerful public speakers, 
and gain confidence in any situation.

Author Talks: The collectionIn a discussion with McKinsey Global Publishing’s 
Diane Brady, Denise Woods, one of the nation’s 
most sought-after voice and dialect coaches, laid 
out some advice on becoming a compelling speaker. 
In her new book, The Power of Voice: A Guide to 
Making Yourself Heard (HarperCollins Publishers, 
January 2021), Woods shares the secrets, tips, 
lessons, and stories that have helped Hollywood’s 
biggest stars become confident, effective 
communicators. An edited version of the 
conversation follows.

Make your voice heard

How do we avoid being stereotyped because  
of how we speak? Words like “articulate” can be 
an insult.
The word “articulate,” in and of itself, is not a bad 
word. It’s actually quite a lovely word. It’s what we’ve 
attached to it: as a society, no matter where we’re 
from, we have a tendency in the human condition to 
make ourselves better at the expense of others, 
which is called prejudice.

What holds people back from being  
effective speakers? 
The biggest mistake that people make is that they 
don’t breathe. Something very, very simple. You 
think you’re breathing, but you’re not. We get the 
thought, and then we speak, but that’s not what 
we’re supposed to do. We get the thought, then we 
breathe, then we speak.

Because breath is to a voice what gasoline is to a car. 
If you have no gas in your car, your car goes nowhere. 
The same thing holds true for the voice. If you don’t 
breathe, you have no voice. Vocal variety and vocal 
color is the difference between having a box of 
crayons with 64 crayons or eight crayons. Wouldn’t 
you rather have five shades of green than one  
green crayon? So, I say the same thing about voice. 
As you breathe more deeply into your center, and  
go deep into that emotional wellspring, you will find 
that all sorts of things—the good, the bad, the 
wonderful aspects of who we are—start to color your 
voice, inform your voice, and, ultimately, make your 
voice more interesting.

Particularly for women, either in corporate America 
or Hollywood, it’s important that we relax and 
connect the voice to the breath. A lot of times we’re 
not relaxed because we feel we have to go in  
and prove ourselves. 

Being articulate is lovely. It’s just the presupposition 
that everybody else not like you is not articulate.  
And that’s where we run into problems in society, not 
just as African Americans, or culturally, but in terms 
of gender as well.

We need a paradigm shift. And I think the paradigm 
shift starts in Hollywood. I think the paradigm shift 
starts in journalism, in the media. The stories we see 
in film and television, the stories we hear on the 
evening news—the producers of these stories need 
to be conscious of the narrative so that it becomes 
more inclusive. We then see strong women as  
the norm. We see articulate people—be they Asian, 
Latinx, or African American—as the norm, so  
it then becomes a thing of the past to single out  
a strong, Black woman who’s articulate. It’s  
the norm.

What impact has the pandemic had on our voices? 
In this new age of being masked—either literally 
being behind a mask or behind a virtual mask  
on Zoom calls—we now have to use our voices more 
liberally than ever. In the past, we had physical  
cues, we had body language, we had gestures. We 
had all kinds of cues that would let the listener  
know what we were saying. I’m in a box right now 
because I’m behind a mask. Typically, when I go

out, I’m in a mask, in sunglasses, and I usually have a 
cap on, so you can’t see any of my face. What we 
have to rely on are our voices. At this point, it’s all we 
have. It’s all we have to really show the fullness of 
who we are. 

Good vibrations

What message do you want people to take away 
from this book?
Working on your voice is also working on your 
posture, on your delivery, on how you perceive 
yourself, on everything. It gives you confidence. 
Voices are like fingerprints; no two voices are the 
same. This work shows you how to bring your full 
essence to your voice so that you can be heard, so 
that you can be respected, so that you can be 
appreciated for being the unique person that  
you are.

A lot of times, we’ve thought, “Oh well, that’s for 
people who use their voices for a living. Oh, that’s for 
the actors. Oh, they sound stagey or they sound 
theatrical.” I’m encouraging everybody to find the 

theatricality, to find the fun, to find the depth of 
utilizing their voice.

It’s an instrument. It would be tantamount to having 
a guitar and only being able to play one song on it. 
That would be a travesty. What I’m saying is, use this 
instrument that you’ve been gifted with. There are 
some voices that are inherently more beautiful than 
others; not everyone will sound like James Earl 
Jones. But we all have our own personal instrument 
that has depth, and beauty, and resonance that we 
can tap into, that will leave an indelible impression. 

Vibration. That’s all voice is. You want people to feel 
your vibration. You want people to see your vibration. 
You want people to hear your voice. And if anything 
is in your voice or your speech that detracts from the 
story, that becomes a distraction, then [you should] 
address it. But I don’t think where you come from, a 
wonderful lilt of the dialect that you naturally have,  
is a distraction because that’s a part of who you are. 
That’s your voiceprint, and it should be honored, and 
it should be respected, and ultimately, loved.

corporate social responsibility offers practical 
steps to build real and meaningful networking 
contacts by tapping into humanity and learning to 
be more intentional and authentic. An edited 
version of the conversation follows.

What problem were you trying to solve with  
this book?
I’m super happy with books on networking. We all 
need to network. But what I started to see over the 
last several years was this overreliance on 
technology, as well as our desire for clicks, likes, 
and numbers of followers growing, which I felt 
missed the importance of building deeply 
meaningful personal relationships that span the 
test of time.

Disconnected in a connected world

What surprised you most about writing this 
book—in the research or writing?
There were many aha moments, many surprises 
during the researching and interviewing of those  
I call “characters” for the book. And I have to  
say, the connection between health and our 
meaningful, deep connections was surprising.  
You actually live longer if you have deeply personal, 
long-standing relationships. 

Honestly, if readers were to say, “I just want to get 
more numbers on Twitter,” it may not be the best 
book for them. However, I think by the time they are 
halfway through, they will see the magic that 
actually happens when you build deeply 
meaningful relationships—whether it’s having a 
Rolodex of experts to  tap into when you are 
looking for your next job, or looking for where to go 
next on a trip, or perhaps looking for a nonprofit 
that you want to get involved in. It’s a lot easier to 
do that when you have positive, deep relationships 
rather than just contacts on social media.

‘I have found that when you are more 
vulnerable and more open, other  
people are more open, which creates a 
much richer dynamic to help make the 
workplace a better place.’

Author Talks: The collectionIs a “my work is my life; my life is my work” 
philosophy really for everyone?
I certainly don’t believe that every person has to 
always be “on.” That is certainly not what I’m 
suggesting. I have just found—probably since the 
mid ’90s, once email came into our personal and 
professional lives—that there really was no longer 
that delineation between your “work self” and your 
“home self.” So instead of running from it and hiding 
from it, let’s just be our real selves. I have found that 
when you are more vulnerable and more open, other 
people are more open, which creates a much richer 
dynamic to help make the workplace a better place.

I’m not suggesting that we spill all of our personal 
lives to our professional colleagues. And I realize 
that if you’re not happy in your job, it’s very, very 
hard to want to be part of your job. But I have found 
the work that I do, personally working in social 
impact, to be so enriching that the people around 
me are almost all working within some semblance of 
social impact. So it has created a very rich and 
rewarding environment. 

Look within first

How does the gather phase help unlock  
self-discovery?
The book is divided into three components: the 
gather phase, the ask phase, and the do phase.

The gather phase—much of it—is looking inside and 
determining several things. What is the community 
you want to build around yourself? What are you 
hoping to accomplish? What would you like to see in 
one year, three years, five years down the road in 
terms of the people who are surrounding you? 
Answering these questions will also help you 
understand what your desires are, what you bring to 
the table. 

One of the themes through the book is this notion 
of, how can I help? How can I be of better service to 
others? And I have to say, before you can do that, 

you have to understand the gifts you have. But I will, 
with 100 percent certainty, state that every single 
person has something to offer—no matter who they 
are.

Is there practical advice for doing research on  
a person you want to network with? 
The ask-phase portion of the book actually helps 
you ask the right question so that you can have a 
meaningful conversation. And there’s even, in one 
of the chapters, the seven questions to ask that 
can elicit meaningful responses. And the beautiful 
thing is, for young and old today, we have so many 
resources at our fingertips before we meet 
someone to find out so much about them—for  
good and bad. The element of surprise is almost 
gone. But if there is somebody you know you are 
going to see or meet at an event, whether it’s a 
virtual event or an in-person event, you can go to 
LinkedIn, you can go to Twitter, you can go to 
Instagram, and you can find out so much about that 
person. So when it does come time to actually 
speak, you already have so much information in 
your toolbox. 

But I would try to get away from the conversations 
like, “What’s the weather like?” or “What did you 
have for lunch?”  Instead ask questions like, “When 
this pandemic ends, where in the world do you  
want to go?” or “What has been most challenging 
for you over the last 12 months?” or “Is there 
anything that you feel could be helpful to get you 
through the next few months before we can come 
back into reality?”

One fun tip from the book that I love to talk about is 
that we all have FOMO [fear of missing out]. We had 
it as soon as social media started. In fact, I think I 
had FOMO long before social media, when I knew 
there was a party going on, and I wasn’t invited. But 
now, we see in 24 hours all of the events that are 
happening that somehow we didn’t get an 
invitation to.

‘We all have FOMO. We had it as soon as 
social media started. ... But I decided 
that I am going to create “JOMO.”  
And instead of joy of missing out, which 
is what people immediately think of 
when they hear JOMO, it is the joy of 
meeting others.’

When this phenomenon first started, I decided that 
I am going to create “JOMO.” And instead of joy of 
missing out, which is what people immediately 
think of when they hear JOMO, it is the joy of 
meeting others.

Create your own gathering—and that gathering can 
be virtual. I just hosted a book talk last night and 

had 25 people join. And I did that myself, just 
inviting people. But it doesn’t have to be 25 people. 
You can do it with four people. Get together and 
have a conversation about anything under the sun. 
But the point is, if you’re the convener, you’re not 
being invited. You’re doing the inviting. So think of 
it as the joy of meeting others.

Fred Dust on making 
conversations count

In his new book, Fred Dust reveals ways to navigate difficult  
conversations and communicate more empathetically.

McKinsey Global Publishing’s Raju Narisetti 
chatted with Fred Dust, former senior partner and 
global managing director at the design-thinking firm 
IDEO. In his latest book, Making Conversation 
(HarperCollins, 2020), the leading voice and 
practitioner of human-centered design and 
networked innovation outlines the elements 
essential for successful exchanges. An edited 
version of the interview follows.

they’ve been, on the whole, human, humane, joyful—
even fun. But one of the first things I’d recommend 
is throwing out the old rule book you might have and 
rewriting the rules of conversations. They do not 
have to happen via Zoom; it can be a one-on-one 
phone call, working together on a Google doc. Think 
of conversations as asynchronous: break up a 
90-minute call into three 30-minute calls over  
three days.

What problem are you trying to solve with  
this book? 
The global, local, corporate, and familial inability to 
successfully navigate hard conversations. I thought, 
by the way, I’d find answers in the spectacular or  
far-flung—Japanese tea ceremonies or pilgrimages—
but in the end many of the most remarkable and 
transformational anecdotes come from seemingly 
mundane circumstances. Sometimes it’s as simple 
as taking a deep breath before talking to an angry 
neighbor or noticing the change that occurs 
immediately after talking about a movie you’ve seen 
with friends.

What surprised you most about writing this book—
the research, writing, or early response? 
My first and biggest surprise was that when I sold 
the book to HarperCollins, my editor took me to a 
fancy lunch to celebrate, and as we’re sitting over 
sushi she said, “Oh, by the way, the book has to be 
relentlessly hopeful and optimistic about 
conversations.” Up until then, it had been, really, a 
book about how we got bad at them. That 
requirement added about a year to my writing. 

Conversations in the next normal

In a year when everything went virtual, your book 
also offers practical lessons on designing 
conversations to drive impact. Talk about how to 
achieve that when we all have conference-call 
fatigue, and and when the connections that can 
happen in face-to-face events are absent. 

I’ve been running virtual conversations, convenings, 
and serious strategy discussions since March 1, and 

Maybe most important, design in the things that get 
designed out through technology—mostly the 
human. Ditch the backdrop in favor of real life—I’ve 
had CEOs telling me they finally see their people and, 
likewise, their employees saying that their boss feels 
more human. Add in a surprise, a bit of suspense; 
ask people to tell a short story about who they were 
at 12. Just a little bit of human can take us a long way.

There is no C-suite playbook for having hard 
conversations, which were never easy inside 
organizations even in a nonvirtual world. What are 
some useful lessons from this book about having 
those conversations in this increasingly virtual 
world that businesses are operating in?  
In that case, it’s good that I just told you to throw 
rules away. You know, there isn’t a manual, but there 
are a lot of implicit rules, and that, frankly, is more 
damaging than if there was a playbook. 

Maybe one of the most basic ideas in the book is to 
set and reset the rules of conversation. By doing so, 
you shift to rule sets appropriate for the work to be 
done. For instance, the rules for brainstorming are 
not the rules for critiquing, and you need rules for 
both of them. So many people hate brainstorming, 
for instance, but if you look back at the original rules 
of brainstorming, written in the 1940s, they’re 
shorter—only four—they’re better explained, and 
they’re explicit that there will be a time for critique 
after the brainstorming hour is over. A lot more 
people would buy into brainstorms if the rules were 
that clear and good.

Karin M. Reed on  
virtual meetings

In her new book, Karin M. Reed dives into our sudden shift to virtual meetings—
and how to make the most of them.

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey’s Justine Jablonska chatted with video 
communications expert Karin M. Reed about her 
book, Suddenly Virtual: Making Remote Meetings 
Work (Wiley, 2021). The Emmy-award-winning 
broadcast journalist and CEO of Speaker Dynamics 
compiled her expertise with coauthor Joseph 
Allen’s data into an engaging and practical guide 
about how to both lead and participate in virtual 
meetings. An edited version of the conversation 
follows.

What problem are you hoping to solve with  
this book?
Initially, when the pandemic hit, everybody took 
emergency action in order to move business 
forward. So they grabbed whatever tools they could 
to work remote from home, to get business done.

And it might not have necessarily been the thing that 
worked best; it was just the thing that worked. A 
year into the pandemic, people are starting to be a 
bit more strategic in how they’re using those tools 
and what kind of tools they want to use. Our book is 
designed to be a practical guide: data-based 
insights coupled with real-world application—best 
practices that are based in science.

So rather than an agenda of ten items, think about 
an agenda of two items, and get into that meeting 
and get stuff done. Chop things up so that you have 
a 20-minute meeting, as opposed to a two-hour 
meeting, because you have to understand the limits 
of endurance and attention span in this environment.

It’s also important to determine who should be in 
the meeting. The sweet spot for any productive 
discussion that needs to lead to a decision is five to 
seven people. And that is any meeting, whatsoever. 
If you have more than seven people in a virtual 
meeting and you’re trying to have a productive 
dialogue, it’s very unwieldy. 

What are some practical tips for video- 
meeting participants?
One of the mistakes that I see people make is they 
ignore how they show up whenever they are 
speaking on webcam. And there are a couple of 
things that you should definitely be attending to. 
It’s not a matter of vanity. It’s a matter of being 
respectful of your conversation partner. If your 
face is in shadow or your audio is really crackly, it’s 
the equivalent of forcing somebody to have a 
phone call with you when the connection is bad.

Efficiency is key

Can you share best practices around  
video meetings? 
A lot of best practices for making meetings really 
effective seem like common sense, but they’re 
uncommonly practiced. And a lot of those bad habits 
are exacerbated in a virtual setting. Video calls don’t 
need to happen if they are simply a matter of 
checking a point or a quick information share. But 
we’re missing out on those conversations when you 
poke your head into somebody’s office and say, 
“Hey, a quick follow-up on that.” 

You want to make sure that you can communicate 
effectively in full. First of all, ensure that your 
background is uncluttered and nondistracting. 
Make sure that you don’t have anything behind you 
that would reveal something about you that you 
wouldn’t want revealed, but also that could 
potentially pull focus. Anything that distracts will 
detract from your message.

The second thing I would focus on is lighting your 
face. Facial expressions are so critical in conveying 
your message, so make sure that people can easily 
read them. 

There’s also a matter of understanding about the 
best way to use video and virtual meetings. The 
most effective ones are shorter and purpose-driven. 

The third thing I would consider is your audio. 
Record yourself on a video call so you can hear 
how your audio sounds, or hop on a call with a

trusted colleague or friend who will tell you how 
you sound. Don’t just rely on the built-in 
microphone on your laptop. Oftentimes, they don’t 
have clear audio fidelity.

Consider your camera position: you want your 
camera at eye level. A lot of times, people are using 
the webcam that’s embedded in their laptop, and 
they keep it down on their desk or down on the table, 
and they appear to be looking down. Whenever you 
look down, it’s like you’re looking down on the 
person you’re having the conversation with. We 
would never do that in a face-to-face conversation. 
You don’t want to do that in a virtual setting. If you’re 
using a laptop, elevate it. Put it on a stack of books 
or on a box. If you have an external webcam, stick it 
on a tripod, and then you can adjust the height 
based on what works in your space. And then ensure 
that you are squarely framed, meaning that you have 
a little bit of space between the top of your head and 
on either side of your shoulders. 

Why is eye contact important during  
virtual meetings?
This is always a challenge for people in a virtual 
setting. If you want to speak with impact, you need 
to be looking primarily at the camera lens. Now this 

will go against every natural impulse that you have, 
because the majority of us want to make eye contact 
with our conversation partners. And typically, 
they’re on the screen. But guess what? The camera 
is not embedded in the screen, so you need to 
actually look at the camera lens, or else you’ll look 
like you’re looking down or looking in a place that is 
not into the eyes of your conversation partner. 

As the speaker, you spend less time looking at the 
listener than the listener does looking at the 
speaker. You want to interact with the camera as if 
you are with a person face-to-face. So primarily 
you’re pouring energy through the camera lens, but 
you are not staring into it.

Engage with participants

What’s your advice for virtual-meeting leaders? 
Proactive facilitation is critical in any virtual 
meeting because there’s a lot of stilted and stunted 
conversation. People don’t know when it’s their 
turn to talk. I advocate cold-calling with good 
intention, meaning call on people by name to let 
them know, “OK, you have the floor.”

Communication

58

Author Talks: The collectionYou can look for nonverbal cues that might indicate 
that somebody has something to say. If somebody 
leans toward the camera, that’s usually an 
indication that they have something they want to 
add. If somebody unmutes themselves, I will say, 
“Hey, Justine, it looks like you have something to 
say.” And maybe they say, “No, I don’t have 
anything to say.” But I’d rather have you err on that 
side than just have a period where nobody is 
responding and you don’t engage in dialogue.

The chat feature is a great functionality for many 
platforms, especially if you have a larger meeting, 
or if you are dealing with a global team. We have to 
start rethinking what we consider to be 
participation. In a large video meeting, it can be 
really daunting to get the gumption to speak up. 
Folks might find it much easier to put their 
participation in the form of text. The challenge is 
for the leader to take a look at that chat and 
incorporate that into the verbal conversation.

What surprised you most throughout  
your research?
The genesis of the book came from a webinar that I 
did with my coauthor Dr. Joseph Allen, who is a 
meeting scientist. We were talking about the future 

of the modern meeting, postulating that three, five, 
ten years out, virtual meetings were going to 
become a big part of how we do business, and that 
video would be at their core.

That was the first week of March of 2020. Think 
about what happened the second week of March 
2020. Everything went haywire. We were suddenly 
all on these video-collaboration platforms. The 
exponential adoption of video-collaboration tools 
was really surprising to me in terms of how quickly 
people said, “Yes, we need to use these.”

Will virtual meetings stick around?
All trends indicate that we will be in a hybrid situation 
for the foreseeable future. Some folks are very 
anxious to come back to the brick-and-mortar 
office. Other folks are saying, “This remote work is 
really working for me.”

You have to be able to figure out how to handle a 
hybrid meeting where you have three people in a 
co-located conference room here, three people in a 
co-located conference room there, and then five 
people joining on an individual webcam. And the 
challenge for the meeting leader is to figure out how 
to get everybody to talk to each other.

Gillian Tett on  
looking at the world like 
an anthropologist

Gillian Tett, the Financial Times markets and finance columnist and US  
managing editor, presents a radically different strategy for making sense 
of the business world today: anthropology.

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey’s Raju Narisetti chatted with award-
winning financial journalist and anthropology PhD 
Gillian Tett. In her new book, Anthro-Vision: A New 
Way to See in Business and Life (Simon & Schuster, 
June 2021), Tett explores how anthropologists 
get inside the minds of people to help them 
understand other cultures and appraise their own 
environment—from studying big-box warehouses 
to shedding light on practical questions such as 
why corporate projects fail and how companies sell 
products such as pet food. An edited excerpt of the 
conversation follows.

Why did you write this book?
I believe that so many of the mistakes that came 
out of the great financial crisis and so many of the 
other mistakes that have beset both companies 
and countries in recent years have occurred 
because of tunnel vision and a lack of lateral vision, 
or, as I call it, “anthro-vision.”

When the pandemic hit in 2020, there was a lot of 
discussion about life postpandemic and building 
back better. And I believe passionately that to build 
back better, we don’t just need policy debate or 
gazillions of dollars of stimulus or things like that.

We also need to change the way policy makers, 
business leaders, financiers, and executives 
actually think and look at the world around them. 
And, in a nutshell, people need to move from tunnel 
vision to lateral vision. The late 20th century was 
marked by a time when we created these fantastic 

intellectual tools to navigate the world—such as 
economic models, corporate balance sheets, and 
big data sets. 

And they are all brilliant and useful. Let me stress 
that. But they’re limited. Because you can only use 
them effectively if you look at context—if you look 
at the wider environment and culture and issues 
such as those, particularly where that context is 
changing. And right now the context is changing. 
So I say we need to look beyond just narrow tunnel-
vision models and actually try to look at the wider 
environment we’re operating in.

Behavioral science can’t be ignored

Why can’t medicine alone stop pandemics?
The core message of the book is that social science 
and anthropology need to be combined with 
medical science, computer science, economic 
science to really create an effective new way of 
building back better and looking at the world. And 
what’s happened with the pandemic is a classic 
example of that.

Because to fix the pandemic, you definitely need 
brilliant medical science. The geniuses who came 
out and collaborated on the vaccines did an 
incredible service to humanity. What we learned in 
the pandemic is that medicine alone doesn’t work 
unless you also understand the social and cultural 
context and the incentives shaping people.

‘What we learned in the pandemic is  
that medicine alone doesn’t work unless 
you also understand the social and  
cultural context and the incentives  
shaping people.’

Gillian Tett on looking at the world like an anthropologist

61

Because you can have all the vaccines in the 
world, but if you can’t persuade a population to 
take them, then you can’t beat a pandemic.  In the 
United Kingdom, Gus O’Donnell, the former head 
of the British Civil Service, lamented the fact that 
although the UK government had devised its policy 
on the back of medical science, it took a very long 
time for the United Kingdom to get ahead of the 
pandemic because it didn’t look at the social-science 
component or how humans behave. 

Or, to take a more positive example, if you look at 
why masks are so effective, one way to explain that 
is because the physical fabric stops germs. Another 
equally important way to explain it is because the 
act of putting on a mask is a powerful psychological 
prompt that reminds people to change their 
behavior. It’s also a group’s thinking device that 
tells people, other people and yourself, that you’re 
adhering to civic norms. And that is incredibly 
important in a pandemic. Actually, we have known 
that from anthropology for a long time in Asia. If only 
Western leaders had not been so full of hubris and 
learned lessons from Asia earlier on, we probably 
could have beaten the pandemic a lot earlier.

When the COVID-19 pandemic started, there were 
social scientists and doctors who said, “We have to 
learn the lessons from Ebola as well as from SARS 
in Asia and apply them to how we devise pandemic 
policy in the West.”

Now, in some cases, the lessons were learned 
the same way that New Yorkers were persuaded 
en masse to embrace masks, which was such a 
completely alien concept a year ago, particularly 
because in New York mask wearing wasn’t 
imposed by rules or laws, as it was in other parts of 
the world, but instead by social norms.

But in other cases, the issues of social behavioral 
science were sadly ignored. And the inverse of 
New York’s mask-wearing culture, which I do 
think has really helped to fight the pandemic, has 
been London, where the behavioral science was 
essentially ignored.

The communication went back and forth and back 
and forth in a completely confusing way. And you 
ended up with a population that was so grumpy, so 
angry, that you had a flare-up toward late 2020, 
which was very damaging indeed for Britain.

Why do bankers misread risk?
Well, I find the issue of high finance fascinating 
because I’m trained as a cultural anthropologist. I 
did a PhD out in the mountains of Hindu Kush, in 
Tajikistan, looking at Tajik wedding rituals, which 
seems like an exotic type of topic that is utterly 
unrelated to Wall Street and Washington and 
things such as that.

But when I actually moved on in my career and 
ended up running the financial-markets section  
for the Financial Times, I was stunned by the 
training in Tajik anthropology—a training that 
teaches you to look at everything and look at  
social silences, the parts of the world we don’t  
talk about, but which are often expressed in rituals 
and symbols.

That’s incredibly helpful for looking at bankers 
for several reasons. First, because financiers 
make the mistake of thinking that finance is all 
about money. And your algorithm and model can 
explain everything. The reality is that how money 
moves, what goes wrong with money, is also driven 
by all the social and cultural patterns that shape 
financiers who are operating as institutions.

Your average investment bank is as tribal as  
any other society across the Hindu Kush. And 
you have all the tribal patterns playing out, which 
people often ignore or prefer to conceal from 
themselves and from others. The other problem  
of course is that financiers become beset with 
tunnel vision when they try to imagine the world 
of money. And they don’t see the end users in 
the chain of any financial innovation they create 
or even have a joined-up vision of how risks are 
building—they may be building in places they avert 
their eyes from.

Author Talks: The collectionThe value of incidental  
information exchange

Do we still need offices?
There’s a lot of debate right now about whether 
people actually need to be physically in an office to 
get their job done. As you look at that question, it’s 
worth thinking about one sector where there has 
been a complete paradox for the past 20 years in 
relation to that question.

That is finance. Technically speaking, around the 
turn of the century, financiers could have done a 
lot of their work at home. Because if you have a 
Bloomberg machine and a high-speed internet 
connection, you can trade. You can do a lot of what 
you need to simply sitting in your office.

Yet, as an anthropologist named Daniel Burns has 
pointed out, at the very moment that all of these 
digital tools were coming onstream in the early 
years of the 21st century, banks on Wall Street and 
the City of London started building bigger and 
bigger trading floors to get more and more people 
into the office.

So if you ask why that was, it becomes clear that 
what people are doing in offices is not just what they 
think they’re doing, which is looking at a computer 
screen and trading in disembodied markets. They’re 
also engaged in something that anthropologists call 
“incidental information exchange.”

And that’s the process by which teams or groups 
or departments that already know each other 
well bump into other teams, other sources of 
information, and really widen their vision and their 
gaze and their net on information, which enables 
them to do their jobs.

That leads to another point, which is what 
anthropologists call “sense making”—the idea 
that when we make decisions, we tell ourselves 
we’re doing so on the basis of our wonderful linear 
rational thoughts or models, when we’re actually 
absorbing information from our surroundings and 

environments and from other people the whole 
time, which means that we often collectively make 
decisions as a group. 

The reason it’s called sense making is because 
there’s a classic story from anthropology of the 
Chuukese Polynesian sailors who essentially 
navigate vast distances across the sea, but not 
by using GPS and basically imposing a course on 
the environment to work out where you’re going, 
which is what modern sailors do. They instead read 
the wind and the wave and the water. And they 
smell their environment and talk to each other, and 
collectively they plot a course by reacting to  
their environment.

So we all think in the office that we’re acting like 
modern sailors with GPS. And we are to a degree. 
But we’re also acting like Chuukese sailors, 
essentially reading our environments and plotting 
a course collectively that way. That’s one reason 
that banks have big trading floors. Also, many 
people find that not being in the office robs them of 
something in terms of doing their jobs.

Adjust your lens for better vision

Should CEOs think like anthropologists?
My advice about how CEOs can embrace anthro-
vision or lessons from anthropology really falls 
into three key buckets. First, musings from 
anthropology help you understand your customers 
much better and, above all else, do something 
that is, in some ways, the simplest thing in the 
world (but the hardest thing in the world to actually 
implement): recognize that other people don’t think 
like you.

It’s so easy if you are a CEO or an aspiring 
executive who spends all day basically in the 
office or working on a project to fall into the 
trap of assuming that other people have the 
same instincts and mentality as you. And it is so 
important in today’s globalized world to recognize 
that this assumption is simply not true.

‘There’s this wonderful Chinese  
proverb that a fish can’t see water.  
And it’s very hard for us to see ourselves 
unless we step out of ourselves and  
look back afresh.’

It’s important to learn to walk in someone else’s 
shoes and see the world differently. That way you 
avoid risks, but you also see new opportunities all 
over the place. The second point is you need to use 
anthro-vision not just to look at your own customers, 
clients, or suppliers, but also to look inside your own 
organization and see all the things that are hidden 
in plain sight that are incredibly hard for insiders to 
see. There’s this wonderful Chinese proverb that a 
fish can’t see water. And it’s very hard for us to see 
ourselves unless we step out of ourselves and look 
back afresh.

The third area where anthropology is sort of helpful 
is in terms of recognizing that these bounded 
tunnel-vision tools that we have used to navigate 
the world in recent decades, such as an economic 
model or a big data set or a corporate balance 
sheet, are wonderful, but they are also limited.

It’s becoming very clear that for a company, the 
corporate balance sheet isn’t the be-all and end-
all in terms of measuring the company. Because 

things that people used to consider as footnotes 
to the corporate accounts, such as diversity issues, 
actually impact the company.

As for big data, it is only as good as the data you 
put into a model. If the data are based on the 
recent past and the present, the predicted future 
may not be the same as the recent past when the 
context is changing.

So that three-part message is really at the core 
of what I think anthro-vision could offer: better 
understanding of other people outside of your 
company who are your customers and clients; 
better appreciation of what’s happening inside 
your company; and a realization about how you as a 
company sit within a wider ecosystem, and why you 
have to widen that lens.

Author Talks: The collectionAngus Fletcher on the 
power of literature

In a new book, Angus Fletcher examines literary inventions through the 
ages to show how writers have created technical breakthroughs.

Angus Fletcher on the power of literature

65

McKinsey Global Publishing’s Raju Narisetti 
chatted with Angus Fletcher about his new book, 
Wonderworks: The 25 Most Powerful Inventions  
in the History of Literature (Simon & Schuster,  
March 2021). In the book, Fletcher—a practitioner 
of story science—reviews the blueprints for the 
most powerful developments in the history of 
literature and uses science to show how literature 
can alleviate a range of negative emotions while 
sparking creativity, courage, love, empathy, hope, 
joy, and positive change. An edited version of the 
conversation follows.

Everyone has had the experience of reading  
a literary work and mining it for themes or 
representations and being told that your own 
individual responses, the characters you like, the 
emotions you experience, the imaginations it sparks 
in your head, aren’t what we’re going to talk about  
in the class. What I want to talk about is how 
neuroscience allows a more diverse, more inclusive, 
and more student-centered approach to unlocking 
literature but in an environment where we can also 
talk about knowledge and wisdom and other things 
that aren’t entirely subjective.

What made you want to write this book? 
There’s a crisis in the way that literature is taught. 
Students aren’t engaged, and they don’t want to 
take literature classes at higher levels. They choose, 
instead, to go into STEM [science, technology, 
engineering, and math] and other fields. Literature 
has always been one of the prime sources of 
creativity and innovation. The more that literature 
falls out of the curriculum, the less that students 
embrace it, the less that we have those drivers. 

I wrote the book to explain that there’s actually a 
different way—a more scientific way—to study 
literature. If we can start to introduce that different 
way of teaching literature in schools, I think we can 
start to bring back some of the powerful change that 
literature has produced in the past and can produce 
in our future. Wonderworks gives you the blueprints 
for using your favorite books and films and comic 
books and memoirs to get more courage, more 
curiosity, more healing, more growth, and more 
happiness from the day.

Why try and capture the impact of literature in an 
almost clinical way?  
One of the things that neuroscience teaches us 
is that our brains are all different. All of us are 
going to have different responses to literature. In 
schools, literature is currently taught on a model that 
comes to us from the early 20th century and that 
establishes logic as the way that we read literature.

Literature heals

What surprised you most in researching  
this book? 
I think the thing that surprised me is how much 
science and medicine there is backing the power of 
literature. We’ve all had the experience of reading 
a poem and feeling better, or reading a book and 
feeling less lonely. Literature can actually be 
therapeutic with trauma—multiple types of trauma.  
It can spark creativity, reduce stress and anxiety, 
promote personal growth, and there is neuroscience 
to back all these things. That was the thing that was 
most surprising to me.

On The Godfather: 
A lot of people are surprised by the fact that I have 
Mario Puzo’s The Godfather in the book. They’re 
even more surprised by the way that I read it 
because I don’t read it thematically. If we were to 
read it thematically, the way we’re taught to read 
in school, we would say, “Oh, this is about being a 
gangster,” or “This is about violence,” and we should  
interpret it as a kind of sermon or message on being 
a gangster or on violence. 

What I point out is that reading The Godfather 
actually has the neurological effect of making you 
less lonely and reducing the adverse effects of 
loneliness. Where does this come from? It comes 
from the fact that The Godfather is part of a tradition

of literature that goes back to some of our earliest 
operas that used a technique from music to create 
a feeling of bonding to the writing. That bonding 
makes us feel less lonely. You can feel that operatic 
effect just in reading The Godfather. It feels like 
an opera. The overall take is that when you read 
literature, it’s not about the themes. It’s not about 
the arguments or what the literature seems to be 
saying, like we’ve all been taught in school. It’s about 
the psychological effects, and those come from the 
actions that the work is making as opposed to the 
things that it’s saying on the surface.

Is your approach taking some of the fun away? 
The first thing I would say is, enjoy the literature. 
Have fun. I’m not trying to tell you that you have to 
experience literature this way. I’m not here to tell 
anyone that they have to do anything. I’m simply 
saying that there’s an opportunity: if you want to get 
more out of literature, it can give it to you. The way 
you might think about it is the way you might think 
about a friendship. We all have friends that we just 
want to have fun with, but some of those friendships 
deepen into more meaningful friendships that can 

change our lives in profound ways. This book is just 
about how to go beyond the fun into that emotional 
and psychological change, if you want to go there. If 
you just want to have fun, that’s OK, too.

To binge or not to binge?

On Stranger Things, Orange Is the New Black,  
and binge watching: 
One of the things that’s happened with the 
development of TV and binge watching and these 
completely addictive shows, as we like to refer to 
them, is that we just can’t stop ourselves watching 
them over and over again. People sometimes get 
concerned and say, “That might be bad for me. I 
might actually be addicted.” The first thing I want  
to assure people is you cannot get addicted to 
literature. The neuroscience is clear about that.  
You can develop a strong desire or preference for 
literature, but you cannot get addicted to literature. 

The other thing that’s really interesting is a lot of the 
shows that we associate as binge-watching shows, 
they’re great opportunities to form friendships. One

‘What that means is that stories are not 
just wonderful for communication but 
they’re also the way that we think, we 
plan, we plot. Those are the beginnings 
of innovation and creation.’  

of the reasons you jump quickly to the next episode 
is because you’re hungry for the story to continue. If 
you watch the episodes with other people, then the 
way you continue the story is by turning to them  
and having a conversation. That’s why those  
binge-watching shows can be the source of real 
connections outside of the imaginary world of TV. 
That’s why they can connect you to some of the most 
elusive people in your lives, including your family—all 
of those people you spend all your hours with but 
don’t connect with maybe as deeply as you’d like.  
Sit down, watch an episode of Stranger Things or 
Orange Is the New Black with them, and see what 
conversations develop.

What’s the value of storytelling to planning, 
strategizing, and even innovating? 
Stories are the most powerful tools that we humans 
have ever invented. Every business plan, every new 
technology, every cultural or political movement gets 
started with a story about tomorrow. When we think 
about the power of stories, we often limit it to their 
powers of communication. We often say, “Oh, that’s 
the way that I communicate my vision,” or “That’s the 
way that I convince people to go along with me.”  
The reason that stories are so powerful as tools of 
communication is because that’s actually the  
way that our brains think. That’s one of the great 
breakthroughs of modern neuroscience—to realize 
that our brains are primarily narrative. The reason 
that stories are so powerful is that they plug into 
the action centers of our brain and literally move 

us. What that means is that stories are not just 
wonderful for communication but they’re also the 
way that we think, we plan, we plot. Those are the 
beginnings of innovation and creation. A lot of our 
focus is not on communication but on how we can 
develop new ways of strategizing, of planning, of 
pooling together our narrative abilities to change 
tomorrow.

Can literature make us better in business? 
My advice to a businessperson would not be to  
read literature for its lessons. I mean, what do  
poets know about business? Why would you read a 
poet to figure out how to run your own 21st-century 
business? Instead, the reason to read literature is  
to stimulate the parts of your brain that you want to 
grow in your business. If you want to grow creativity 
in your business, it might be a good idea to hand  
out The Cat in the Hat or Winnie the Pooh to your 
employees. Simply reading those books would 
help nurture a culture of imagination. If you want to 
build products that promote growth or healing or 
creativity, you should look to books that grow  
those same qualities.

The other surprising lesson we can learn from 
literature is that our world is becoming increasingly 
dominated by AI [artificial intelligence] and by its 
decision making. Companies are looking more and 
more to computers to help them imagine the future. 
There are a couple of problems with that. The first is 
that AI cannot imagine the future. AI, because of  

Innovative thinking

68

Author Talks: The collectionthe way computers work, exists in a continuous 
mathematical present. It is not actually able to 
predict where things are going; only we humans  
can do that through our powers of narrative, 
through our powers of story. 

The other problem with AI is that computers think in 
a way that is different from us. They think in terms 
of spatial patterns. That’s why the more time you 
spend with computers and their data, the more your 
own mind starts to feel like it’s slowly coming apart 
because it’s basically a field, a web of information, 

and that’s not how our brains think. Our brains think 
in simple actions. If you want to develop a single 
sense of purpose, there’s nothing better that you 
can do than read the story of someone who shares 
that purpose. Someone who has the courage or the 
love or the empathy or the curiosity that you want 
to imitate in your own company. Find those stories, 
give those stories to the people in your company, 
and encourage those noncomputer, entirely human 
forms of life.

Josh Linkner on  
how everyday people  
can become everyday  
innovators

In his new book, Josh Linkner offers a practical guide for turning ordinary 
ideas into extraordinary results.

70

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey’s Raju Narisetti chatted with 
Josh Linkner about his new book, Big Little 
Breakthroughs (Post Hill Press, April 2021). In the 
book, the founder and CEO of five tech companies—
and professional-level jazz guitarist—discusses 
what holds us back from unlocking our creative 
prowess and provides an approach that leaders and 
everyday people can use to innovate for a better 
company, career, and life. An edited version of the 
conversation follows.

What problem are you trying to solve with  
this book? 
Innovation, generally, is looked at as an exclusive 
club for a select few. We think of innovation as these 
giant product breakthroughs or that it only counts if 
it’s a billion-dollar idea. And in that context, it’s only 
people wearing a lab coat or a hoodie that get to  
be creative. 

I set out to make a book that helps everyday  
people become everyday innovators. It’s sort of like 
innovation for the rest of us. What I was trying to  
do is democratize creativity and innovation. And  
give people a practical toolkit, as well as some 
inspirational mindsets, so they can go on to unlock 
their own creative potential—ultimately, to achieve 
the outcomes that they care about the most.

Creativity takes courage 

What is it that holds us back? 
I saw a study that 72 percent of our gross domestic 
product here in the United States doesn’t come 
from the breakthrough ideas that we see in the 
media; it comes from everyday innovation—people 
building their small businesses, say. I’ve researched 
human creativity now for a couple decades, and the 
research is crystal clear that all of us, and I mean  
all of us, have enormous reservoirs of dormant 
creative capacity. Your hardware is there, and so 
then the question is what’s holding us back? There 
are a couple things. The biggest one is fear. Turns 
out that fear, not a lack of natural talent, is the 
biggest blocker of creativity.

Truthfully, fear and creativity cannot coexist. If 
there’s fear in the room or in the building, your 
creativity is going to suffer. The best thing that we 
can do for ourselves and our teams is create a safe 
environment where all ideas are celebrated—the 
good, the bad, and the ugly—because sometimes it 
takes a bad idea to get to the good ones.

The other thing that’s missing is more updated and 
modern technology. Here’s what I mean. In 1958, 
there were a number of new technologies that came 

‘The best thing that we can do for our-
selves and our teams is create a  
safe environment where all ideas are

onto the field. There was the Rolodex for keeping 
track of your contacts. There was magnetic tape for 
storage. And a technology came on the scene for 
idea extraction, called “brainstorming.” Fast-forward 
to 2021. We can store the Library of Congress on 
a thumb drive. We use LinkedIn for our contacts. 
Yet we’re still using the same outdated, ineffective 
technology for idea extraction, called brainstorming.

creative? Unfortunately, so often it looks like this: 
there are 16 people that have permission to be 
creative, and all these other amazing people, who,  
by the way, we hired for their creativity, but then we 
shut it down and don’t let them use it. So for leaders 
running organizations, frankly, of any size, I think  
it’s one of the most important jobs—to create a 
systemized approach to cultivating and harnessing 
and deploying that resource.

So over the past couple of decades, and certainly 
in the book, I share some very practical, fun, much 
more modern approaches, techniques, to bring our 
best ideas forward.

Tell us about your notion of role-storming.  
Brainstorming is a great exercise to yield mediocre 
ideas. Role-storming is a simple technique that 
completely removes the fear. Here’s how it works. 
Basically, everyone takes on the same real-world 
challenge that you were working on to begin with. 
But now each person chooses a character, and 
you’re basically brainstorming in character.

So you might be playing the role of Steve Jobs. 
When you start brainstorming, nobody’s going to 
criticize Steve for coming up with a big idea. They 
might criticize Steve for coming up with a small one. 
So now you, a.k.a. Steve, are liberated. You can say 
anything you want, with no fear of retribution. And 
I know it sounds a little playful, but all you need to 
do is pick. You can be a sports figure, you can be a 
movie star, a musician, a literary figure, a villain, and 
you pretend that you’re that person. And I’ve just 
seen incredible transformations when this type of 
exercise has been deployed. 

Embrace the innovative mindset

How do organizations go about turning this 
anticreative bias into something that can spur 
more creativity? 
We need to talk about how we get those ideas out 
of people’s brains. If you have a 10,000-person 
organization, how do you get everybody to be 

If you had an organization and there was an oil well 
on the property, you’d do everything you could to 
extract that natural resource and deploy it for your 
growth. We have the proverbial oil well inside all of 
our people, and what a shame if we don’t let them 
use it. 

First of all, it’s embracing the mindset of innovation. 
In the book, I cover eight core mindsets of everyday 
innovators. These are things that don’t require years 
of study; they don’t require millions of dollars of 
investment. But when we embrace these mindsets, 
it tends to unlock the creative capacity of the team.

The second thing I think is important to do is 
reinforce those mindsets with rituals and rewards. 
In other words, build it into the system. Take one 
organization—it’s not a big company, it only has 50 
people, but it has a ritual every Friday. The ritual is 
called “F-Up Fridays.” The F-Up Friday ritual is they 
have a big brown-bag lunch, and they go around 
the room, and each person shares what they f’d 
up that week and what they learned from it. By the 
way, these f-ups are shared with pride, and people 
clap and cheer. They’re not shunned or sent to 
corporate time out. When they get to someone that 
didn’t f-up something, they’re, like, “Well, why not? 
What are you going try next week?” And so this 
little ritual makes it safe and comfortable for people 
to take responsible risks, and, again, they sort of 
institutionalized that in their organization. 

A much larger organization did something kind 
of cool. Any time an idea came in through their

‘If you had an organization and there

idea-capture system—company-wide, thousands 
of employees—here’s what they did. They took 
these four-foot-tall glass jars and put them in their 
corporate headquarters. Any idea that came in, a 
white marble went into the jar. Any time an idea was 
embraced and was put into action, they put a red 
marble in the jar. And they filled up all these jars over 
the years, and it’s in this high-visibility area. So when 
people walk past this hall—thousands of people a 
day—they see a whole sea of white with little specks 
of red, which becomes a visual cue that it takes a lot 
of white marbles to get to a red one, and they should 
keep those white ones coming because eventually 
they’ll land on a red one.

So I think there’s a lot of fun, practical ways 
that we can institutionalize, especially in larger 
organizations, the notion that creativity matters, that 
responsible risk taking is part of the job. 

Let the sparks fly

What’s the difference between an idea and  
a spark?  
If you think of an idea as a molecule, what’s inside 
the molecule? Stick it under the microscope and 
let’s take a look. So I tried to look at the anatomy 
of an idea. And in fact, what I recommend people 
do is when you’re just kicking around new ideas, 
don’t even call them ideas, because an idea itself, in 
theory, is ready for scrutiny.

Instead, you should first generate ideas and think 
of them as a spark. It’s like a little beginning of an 
idea; it’s not a finished work product. And that’s a 
much easier way to deal with it because if you’re 
sharing a spark, you’re not sort of getting behind 
it and endorsing it. You’re just saying, “Hey, it’s a 
possibility.” And often it’s the spark that leads to the 
spark that leads to the spark that becomes the great 
idea. Too often, people extinguish those sparks 
prematurely, without giving them the time and space 
to really breathe. 

There’s another little step in that process, called 
audition. So once you have a couple sparks that 
might merit some exploration, let’s try them out. How 
can you quickly prototype this spark to see if it even 
deserves to be elevated to the next level of scrutiny? 
It’s a fairly scientific approach to idea extraction and 
idea cultivation at sort of the molecular level.

What surprised you in researching the book?  
The old model was that it’s a right-brain, left-brain 
thing; your right brain’s the creative one, your left 
brain is the suit-and-tie one. But what we’ve now 
learned, through incredible experiments—they 
literally put jazz musicians’ brains in an MRI machine, 
and they sort of made it so the musicians could, 
using mirrors, still improvise. And they were really 
studying what’s firing in the human brain when 
improvising, when coming up with creativity. And 
what they learned is that it’s not actually a left-brain,

right-brain thing. It’s more of an integrated thing, 
and there are different regions of the brain that work 
in concert with one another to create ideas. 

also deeply reinforced my core belief that there are 
seven billion people walking around on this planet 
with dormant creative capacity. Me included. 

If I were to summarize it—the old face of innovation—
who do we think of? We think of Elon Musk or 
Thomas Edison. But it’s very difficult for most of us 
to really relate to them. It’s hard to see ourselves 
in them. But when we see everyday people solving 
difficult problems in really creative ways, it’s so 
inspiring because that means it’s within the grasp of 
all of us. And, truly, it can be the great equalizer if we 
cultivate these skills and put them into practice.

And here’s the one—just as a jazz guy—that blew 
my mind. When jazz musicians improvise, as 
opposed to just playing written music, that does 
light up. But more fascinating to me was there’s 
another part of the brain that shuts down. It’s the 
part of the brain that’s like our filter, so we don’t say 
the stupid thing that we regret later at the cocktail 
party. But, basically, jazz musicians have trained 
their brains to light up one section and almost shut 
down completely another section to allow them the 
freedom to take various risks.

It’s funny—in jazz, if you play it safe, you get laughed 
off the stage. If you play a terrible note, just play it 
twice more and call it art. Everything is fine. But the 
notion that the brain is functioning in a much more 
integrated manner, to me, was supercool. And it

Talent, culture, and change management

McKinsey’s Eleni Kostopoulos chatted with 
Tsedal Neeley, the Naylor Fitzhugh Professor of 
Business Administration at the Harvard Business 
School, about her book Remote Work Revolution: 
Succeeding from Anywhere (Harper Business, 
2021). The award-winning scholar and expert on 
virtual and global work offers teams and managers a 
road map for navigating the enduring challenges  
of a virtual workforce. An edited version of the 
conversation follows.

What problem were you trying to solve  
with this book?
I started to work on this book project close to three 
years prior to the pandemic. It’s been a topic  
that I’ve pursued for nearly 20 years because I was 
convinced that technology was going to change  
how we worked, how we connected, and how 
workforces would be arranged. But never in my 
wildest dreams did I imagine that the whole  
world would migrate to remote work, and never  
did I imagine that it would be in the midst  
of a pandemic. It pains me that this is how the 
virtualization of work has happened.

What are launches and relaunches, and why are 
they crucial to success?
Launches and relaunches have long been 
established by pioneering sociologists as the way to 
start a team in the most effective way. Richard 
Hackman was a Harvard sociologist who studied 
teams in all forms, in all contexts, for about  
40 years and concluded that when you launch a 
team the right way—meaning you set it up— 
you are actually creating the conditions for that 
team to be effective. In fact, this will increase the 
likelihood of success for teams by 30 percent,  
which is significant. 

The idea of relaunch is to make sure that we are 
realigned, focused on our shared goals, very clear 
about our capabilities, our contributions, our 
resources, and our constraints; that the norms we 
had established are still working for us, so that  
we can revise and update given the dynamic nature 
of all of our lives; and to ensure that there is 

psychological safety, as my friend and colleague 
Amy Edmondson would say, in the work team. I 
recommend you do this every six to eight weeks or 
so in a remote team because it’s so easy to get 
derailed when you’re not co-located.

Building trust from a distance

How do you build trust remotely?
Trust is one of the most studied elements in virtual 
work. I’m talking about decades’ worth of work  
to try to determine the answers to questions such as 
“How do we establish trust?” “How do we maintain 
trust?” “What does trust look like when we barely 
see people in person and don’t have the opportunity 
to have the watercooler conversations and all the 
ways that we know we build trust?”

There are two types of trust. The first one is called 
cognitive trust, which is grounded in the belief  
and the understanding that others are dependable 
and have the competencies to be able to collaborate 
effectively on a common task. The second type of 
trust is called emotional trust. And it’s grounded in 
the belief that others have care and concern for us.

Leaders and managers must ensure that they are 
developing emotional trust with the people that 
they’re working with. People need to know that their 
managers and leaders care about them. 

The cognitive trust you can almost confer right away. 
In virtual work, the term for this is actually swift 
trust—“Once I know you’ve got the qualifications  
to do the work, and once I know that you’re 
dependable, that you’re reliable, I will give you trust 
and we can get to work.” 

But emotional trust takes much longer to develop; it 
requires empathy, self-disclosure, and spending 
time with people, and it has this big temporal 
dimension. Time is really important for that second 
type of trust.

organizations. We know this. So if people are 
struggling to meet their professional demands 
because of the challenges and the demands across 
other parts of their lives, then we need to take the 
gifts that remote work gives us, like flextime.

Some of the smart companies that I’ve had the 
pleasure of working with over the past 12 months 
have tried to truly understand the whole person. And  
what that means is they try to see what they can set 
up between certain hours of the day—when families 
with children, for example, have gap times. What 
activities can the companies actually put in place to 
help parents and families?

From ‘work from home’ to  
‘work from anywhere’

Let’s talk about the return to work. What’s next? 
How do we get it right?
The first thing you want to do is survey your 
employees to truly understand their preferences  
in terms of how they want to see their work 
arrangements post-COVID-19—meaning do they 
want one or two days a week of remote work?  
Do they want remote work full time? Do they want 
nothing to do with remote work? What do they  
really want? And these surveys should be collected 
anonymously, so that we truly have a real picture  
of what people want. 

Once you understand that, you want to develop  
a policy that looks at a hybrid model if you decide to 
move in a direction that includes remote work and 
in-person work. Ask, “What does that look like for us 
given the critical tasks that we need to accomplish

in our organization, given our stakeholders, and 
given the kind of rhythm—the cadence of work—that 
we want to achieve?”

processes, culture, people, and training and that all 
of these pieces are not only aligned but part of the 
executives’ level of work.

For some it’s giving people full freedom: “You can 
come in and out based on the work that we do.” For 
some, “we actually want people in on these  
specific two days a week to ensure that we have 
co-located times.” For others, it’s “work for  
two weeks remotely and then come in for  
two weeks.”

You’ll also need to articulate your revised cultural 
norms. The culture of your organization has newly 
changed, so “What are our cultural norms?”—
meaning “What are the appropriate behaviors that 
we want to espouse to maintain the type of culture 
that is right for us?”

Then, of course, you want to make sure that you’re 
upskilling your entire workforce on remote work and 
digital-mindset competencies. And in many 
instances, depending on your size, you may want to 
consider adding the role of a chief remote officer  
to the C-suite to ensure that there’s oversight across 
the entire workforce on systems, structures, 

Was there anything that surprised you in writing 
the book, in the research or response?
I would say that I was reminded about how 
disciplined we have to be in ensuring that our work 
and nonwork lives are not blurring to the extent  
that our well-being is under attack and to ensure 
that we’re disciplined and thoughtful about  
the digital tools that we’re using to do work—as 
opposed to ad hoc decisions on whether this  
is a synchronous conversation or an asynchronous 
conversation, whether we’re using lean or rich 
media—in order to not only avoid tech exhaustion 
but also to work smart.

In some instances, we need to capture, store, and 
reuse our communication events. If we use the 
phone when in fact we want to capture, store, and 
reuse whatever we’re working on, we should  
make different digital choices.

Leaders have to be disciplined. You don’t want to 
confuse people by saying, “We care about your

night and weekend without making clear: “Please, 
don’t respond until Monday morning.” That’s 
confusing. That’s mixed signals. The discipline part 
is incredibly important.

How does remote work make an impact on an 
organization’s culture?
Many people are concerned about the change that 
remote work might bring to their culture. But the 
reality is that change has already happened by the 
sheer fact that we are now operating remotely.  
And culture means asking, “What are our shared 
values?” and “What are our shared norms?”— 
meaning “What are the appropriate behaviors and 
attitudes that we espouse in our organization?”

Remote work and virtuality have shifted our norms 
of working and what’s appropriate: How do we make 
decisions? How do we connect? How do we 
problem-solve? It’s shifted all of that. So  
the culture has already changed, and the thing to do 
now is think about how you will revise or update  
your culture so that people can thrive in a remote 
environment and adapt to this new world.

Holding on to what was before is how people are 
going to get in trouble. We need to be forward-
thinking, embrace the things that we love, change 
the things that we don’t, and accept the fact that 
our cultures as we know them have changed 
forever.

Deanna Mulligan on 
smart skill building

The former chair and CEO of Guardian Insurance offers a theory of 
change for those hiring, retaining, and retraining the next generation 
of tech-savvy employees. 

80

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey’s Roberta Fusaro chatted with business 
leader Deanna Mulligan about her book, Hire 
Purpose: How Smart Companies Can Close the 
Skills Gap (Columbia University Press, 2020). The 
former chair and CEO of Guardian Insurance distilled 
her research and conversations with leaders in the 
field into a playbook for readers seeking to 
understand how to react to trends in digitization, the 
gig economy, hiring, and education. An edited 
version of the conversation follows.

What problem were you hoping to solve with  
this book?
The problem I was trying to solve is a big societal 
issue—that is, the digitization of everything. That 
and the ability to work from anywhere are creating 
a need for companies to reskill and retrain their 
workforces. Some of McKinsey’s own statistics 
actually bear that out, that in the next decade there 
will be about 350 million jobs changing globally. 
And about 75 million of those jobs will go unfilled, 
using today’s statistics, because companies will be 
unable to find people with the skills they need. I 
wrote the book because I wanted to talk a little bit 
about my experience as CEO of Guardian but also 
about the experiences of a number of other CEOs, 
not-for-profits, university presidents, and 
professors whom I met along the way and their 
experiences with hiring and reskilling. I’m hoping 
that some of these experiences can be useful for 
other companies but that they also start a 
discussion in society about why this is really a 
critical issue for us to tackle right now. Companies 
are going to be a very big part of the solution.

Workforce challenges

Why is digitization so critical, and how is it 
affecting the workforce?
One thing that people think of when they think of 
technology is, “Is a robot going to take my job?” 
Many jobs can be partially automated. Very few 
jobs are going to be fully automated, though there 

will be some. But for the preponderance of people, 
the questions are really going to be: How do I use 
the technology to make my job more important? 
How can I serve the customer better? How can I be 
involved in more sophisticated problem solving? 
How can I raise my game and work better and more 
efficiently with the technology? Those are really 
important questions for today’s workers—and not 
just for people who are building careers and who 
want to keep their jobs, enhance their ability to 
earn, and be satisfied in their jobs. Companies are 
investing a lot of money in this new technology. If 
they want to see the kind of exponential growth we 
think we can get from productivity, they need to 
help people use the technology. This is not 
something people learn in school; there’s going to 
be a lot of learning on the job here. We’re going to 
install a piece of technology, and the people whose 
jobs are enhanced or partially replaced by that 
technology are going to have to tell us, “Well, this 
works, and this doesn’t work.” There’s going to be a 
transition period. 

Where are current hiring processes falling short?
We tend to look for people who have done the job 
before. We tend to scan people’s résumés and say, 
“OK, when have they done this in their past?” Job 
titles have traditionally played a big role in that. But 
we can’t really rely on job titles and what people 
have done in the past to give us clues about whether 
they’ll be able to do jobs that don’t exist yet. We 
need to reorient the way we recruit and hire people 
and train people based on skills descriptions, not job 
descriptions. That is a massive undertaking, 
because most people’s résumés talk mainly about 
their job history. I do think that technology might be 
able to help us out there. Some start-ups and even 
some governmental institutions are experimenting 
with AI [artificial intelligence], for example, to really 
interview people and say, “What have you done in 
the past?”

‘We need to reorient the way we  
recruit and hire people and train  
people based on skills descriptions,  
not job descriptions.’

Workforce interventions

What are some things executives can do right 
now to begin to close the skills gap?
Start small. It’s going to be very difficult to transform 
the whole company all at once. Pick a problem that’s 
vexing today and say, “If we were to apply 
technology and a new way of thinking to this 
problem, how could we have a different and better 
outcome?” Get a team of thought leaders involved in 
solving this problem. And then use it as a pilot 
case—a demonstration that people can change, that 
we can use technology to make our experience and 
our clients’ experiences better. 

Executives should also help everyone understand 
that this transformation process is not going to be 
100 percent error free. At Guardian, we said: We’re a 
learning organization. People need to take 
responsibility for their careers. We’ll give you the 
tools. We’ll give you career-planning workshops and 
self-assessment tests and all kinds of things you 
can use to think about your future. But just know 
that your future may be very different from the job 
you’re in today, and let’s all work together and learn 
what might be coming and how we can prepare for it. 
You can do all those things right now, today, and they 

don’t cost a lot of money. You can do it in a big 
organization or a small organization, or you can do it 
as an individual if you want to be successful in the 
new world.

What advice do you have for young people just 
starting college or entering the workforce?
Remember that people don’t necessarily need a 
four-year degree. We found as we worked closely 
with community colleges and brought interns into 
our organization from community colleges that we 
had great results and that a two-year degree or 
even a certificate program might be just what we 
needed for certain jobs. So while a four-year degree 
is always a good thing, it’s not necessarily the only 
requirement for success. In fact, if you think in terms 
of skills needed, there are certificate programs and 
associate degrees that might make more sense. 

We need to give our young people a mindset of 
flexibility and resilience; they’re not just going to 
graduate with a degree in one area and immediately 
be employed in that area for the rest of their lives. It 
doesn’t work that way anymore. We’re all going to be 
learning, exploring, adding new skills to our 
portfolios. Changing jobs, changing careers. Our 
education needs to be a preparation for that mindset.

Author Talks: The collectionThe impact of the COVID-19 crisis

How has the economic and health crisis brought 
on by the pandemic affected your thoughts about 
the research you’ve done?
The COVID-19 crisis has been, in some ways, a 
huge experiment on some of the premises of the 
book. We’ve all had to learn new things, right? 
We’re all on Zoom now. Not very many of us used 
Zoom to the extent that we do today. We’ve all had 
to learn how to be our own computer support at 
times. We’ve had to learn new household orders. 
We’ve had to learn how to teach our children at 
home. We’ve been agile as a country—we’ve had to 
be. I think we have to have the same attitude 
toward our work and our workforces. We don’t 
have a lot of choices here. We’re going to have to 
try and make it work. 

Most colleges, universities, and community 
colleges have had a good part of their educational 
framework move online. And we’re not likely to go 
back to 100 percent in-person. That’s going to be a 

real game changer—not only for college-age 
students but for workers as well, because we have 
proof that people can learn online. The move to 
online learning and remote work will provide more 
opportunities for typically underrepresented 
minorities and women. But it’s also going to mean 
there’s more competition for each job, because the 
pool won’t just be limited to people who are within 
commuting distance of the office. 

What surprised you most about writing the book?
Well, I was running a Fortune 250 company while I 
was writing the book. So I guess one surprise is, 
the book took a lot longer to write than I thought it 
would. Along the way, the state of the art kept 
changing. Because technology is changing so 
rapidly, I had to go back several times and update 
things that were in the book. It just proved that the 
average person is going to have a hard time 
keeping up with technology when even the book 
that I’m writing about it is becoming dated quickly.

Gary Hamel and Michele 
Zanini on ‘humanocracy’

Bureaucracy actually served us well in the past. But the nature of work has 
changed, and management needs to change too.

84

Author Talks: The collectionGary Hamel and Michele Zanini, cofounders of the 
Management Lab, are the authors of the new book 
Humanocracy (Harvard Business Review Press, 
August 2020). Their argu ment: we need to excise 
bureaucracy and replace it with something better. In 
December 2020, they spoke with Mark Staples, an 
executive editor at McKinsey. What follows is an 
edited version of their conversation. 

What problem are you trying to solve  
with this book?

Gary Hamel: We wrote Humanocracy because we 
believe—as societies, as individuals—that we can no 
longer afford organizations that waste more human 
capacity than they use. Given the challenges we face 
as a species, we cannot afford organizations where 
only 15 percent of employees are truly engaged  
in their work. We cannot afford organiza tions where 
an enormous amount of effort goes into fighting 
bureaucratic battles. We cannot afford organizations 
where less than 30 percent of the people are  
really called on to bring their initiative and their 
originality to work. 

Our goal is to move from a bureaucratic model that is 
focused on maximizing compliance to one that is 
focused on maximizing contribution. And to make 
that switch, we are going to have to challenge the 

very fundamentals of how we think about our 
organizations. Do we need so many managers? Do 
we need so many layers? Do we need all the rules 
and processes? Our answer is no. But to create that 
future, we’re going to have to unlearn most 
everything we’ve learned over the past 150 years 
about how you organize people at work.

Michele Zanini: And, as Gary mentioned, the 
organizations that we profile in the book were built 
with one goal in mind. And that is to maximize human 
contributions. We coined the term “humanocracy”  
to highlight this radically different paradigm of 
organiza tion. And the difference lies in how the role 
of the individual is defined in relationship to the 
institution. In a bureaucracy, it’s the people who are 
the instruments. They are the “resources” who  
are employed by the organization to create products 
and services. In a humanocracy, the relationship  
is flipped: it’s the organization that is the instrument. 
It’s the vehicle that people use to better their lives 
and the lives of those they serve. And it’s through this 
shift in perspective that we can imagine, and begin 
to build, organizations that are incredibly passionate, 
truly creative, and highly adaptable. In other words, 
the kinds of organizations that have the necessary 
capabilities to thrive in the 21st century.

‘ Our goal is to move from a bureaucratic 
model that is focused on maximizing 
compliance to one that is focused on 
maximizing contribution.’

‘ Since 1983, the number of managers and 
administrators in the US workforce has 
more than doubled, while employment in 
all other occupations has gone up by 
only 40 percent.’ 

–Michele Zanini

A massive multiplayer game

The end of bureaucracy—that’s an exciting  
vision. What surprised you most about writing  
the book? Was it the research, the writing,  
the early reception? 

Michele Zanini: The most surprising thing about 
writing the book for me was all the evidence showing 
that bureaucracy has been growing steadily over  
the past few decades. Let me just give you a data 
point: since 1983, the number of managers and 
administrators in the US workforce has more than 
doubled, while employment in all other occupations 
has gone up by only 40 percent.

This wasn’t supposed to happen. Back in 1988,  
the late management guru Peter Drucker predicted  
that by 2008—so, 20 years later—organizations 
would operate with half the levels and no more than  
a third of the managers. And his prediction made 
sense, because it rested on the fact that work  
was becoming more knowledge based and there-
fore harder to script, and that technology would 
allow people to coordinate without managerial 
intermediation, if you will.

Now, Drucker was right about a lot of things, but 
obviously not this particular thing. It just shows  
me that bureaucracy is incredibly persistent and 
deeply entrenched and that, as an organizational 
model, it will take a systematic effort to dislodge it, 
which we try to outline in the book.

Gary Hamel: I think the most startling finding for  
me through our research came from a survey we ran 
with the Harvard Business Review, where we 
surveyed 10,000 managers and leaders around the 
world. Seventy-six percent of those individuals  
who worked in large organizations said that 
bureaucratic behaviors were decisive in who gets 
ahead—not one factor among many, but the  
most important factor. And what that suggested to 
us is that bureaucracy has become a massive 
multiplayer game that’s played for the stakes of 
positional power. And it encourages a certain set of 
behaviors: hoarding resources, elbowing rivals  
aside, managing up, negotiating targets, deflecting 
blame. And that those behaviors consume an 
enormous amount of emotional and intellectual 
energy in organizations and yet contribute almost 
nothing to the achievement of purpose. 

Competence, creativity, autonomy

If bureaucracy is not the answer, what is? 

Gary Hamel: We’ve long been told by management 
experts and pundits that large organizations cannot 
be entrepreneurial. And yet in virtually all of the 
organizations we profile in the book, people on the 
front lines have the autonomy, the upside, the 
business literacy to think and act like entrepreneurs. 
And they flourish. They create far more value  
than their competitors have, higher return on capital, 
much higher engagement scores. And when you  
see this, you understand that we can turn every 

86

Author Talks: The collectionemployee in the world into an entrepreneur,  
with all the positive impact that will have on produc-
tivity growth and on a more equitable distribution  
of the rewards of capitalism.

Michele Zanini: This is really about what we learned 
from people on the front lines. It was truly moving, 
not just surprising. We met employees who design 
their own large and complicated equipment, who 
contract out to suppliers, who talk to the customer 
directly, and who are just incredibly entrepreneurial. 
They basically start their own businesses and 
manage them. They get to make significant business 
decisions. They harness their expertise, their imagi-
nation, and their relationships with their colleagues. 

It just brought home to me, and to Gary, the amazing 
level of talent that is simply wasted in most large 
organizations, where people don’t have these oppor-
tunities. And all this energy, this creativity, comes 
from people and occupations that would typically be 
described as low skill, right? But our experience 
suggests that the term “low skill,” especially when it 
comes to a specific occupation, says very little about 
the people who are in those jobs, and a lot more 
about our prejudice that we need to slot “commodity 
people” in “commodity jobs.”

Right. We hear a lot of talk about meritocracy, but 
do we actually mean it? What’s your take? 

Gary Hamel: In traditional organizations and large 
organizations, your power and influence correlate 
with your position, with positional authority.  
And what you have in effect is an aristocracy of 
administrators. We believe that what we need  
in organizations are multiple hierarchies, where  
your influence and your compensation reflect  
your pure attested competence and your genuine  
value add. And that all of the energy of human 
beings should go into creating more value and not 
those zero-sum battles for promotion. We describe 
that as a meritocracy. 

We are very aware that many people in the world 
don’t have the opportunity to build their skills,  
to build their talents, and that some people are given 
a lot greater opportunity to build the things that 
allow them to thrive in organizations. And we see 
that we can change this. We can go to people  
on the front lines at every level. We can give them 
the business skills. We can give them the oppor-
tunity to experiment, to innovate, and to grow their 
capabilities that allow them to therefore grow  
their contribution and claim a greater share of the 
total rewards. That’s what we mean by meritocracy.

‘  In traditional organizations and large 
organizations, your power and  
influence correlate with your position, 
with positional authority. And what  
you have in effect is an aristocracy  
of administrators.’ 

–Gary Hamel

Talent, culture, and change management

Michele Zanini: The irony is that bureaucracy was 
supposed to excise all the flaws of traditional 
organizations—you know, the nepotism, the politics, 
and so on. But many of these shortcomings haven’t 
gone away; they’ve merely shifted to the informal 
side. To create a truly meritocratic organization, we 
must do four things. We must decontaminate 
judgments about merit. We must better align wisdom 
with authority. We need to correlate compensation 
with contribution as opposed to position in the 
hierarchy. And we need to, as Gary mentioned, build 
naturally dynamic hierarchies where power and 
influence are products of your peer-attested impact, 
and not your particular role. 

Out with the old

How do companies roll back bureaucracy? What 
steps can a CEO take? 

Michele Zanini: We would suggest two. First, start 
with yourself. You know, bureaucracy kind of 
makes jerks of us all. And sometimes we get inured 
to the biases and the elitism that come from a  
top-down management style. And so, ask yourself, 
“In what way am I behaving more like a bureaucrat 
and not so much like a leader who catalyzes the 
initiative and the imagination of colleagues?” The 
second thing is to invite the whole organization  
on this journey with you. Busting bureaucracy is a 
complex task, and no one person will have all the 
answers on how to do that. We think that the journey 

to humanocracy should be open to everyone  
who is willing to shape the organization’s future, in  
a way that elicits the best thinking and generates 
deep commitment. 

Gary Hamel: You reach a point in any field of human 
endeavor where you cannot solve new problems  
with old principles. And I think that’s where we are 
with business and management. We inherited  
a set of principles that were right for the industrial 
age—the principles of standardization, speciali-
zation, routinization, and formalization. They’re good 
if you’re trying to solve the problem of compliance. 
But if you want to build an organization that has an 
evolutionary advantage, that can change as fast  
as the world around it, that has an innovation 
advantage and inspiration advantage, you have to 
start with new principles. 

In the book, we talk about these principles—
principles like ownership, meritocracy, markets, 
openness, and so on. And the goal is to embed 
those principles in the processes and practices of 
how we run our organizations every day. It’s not  
one Armageddon-like battle. It’s going to be a series 
of experiments, guided by a consistent set of 
principles that allow you to build an organiza tion  
that is as capable as the people inside. 

We’re looking forward to a bureaucracy-free 
future. Thank you both for your time.

inside out. The result? A new understanding of the 
business, economic, and societal importance of 
trust and how to regain it once lost. An edited 
version of their conversation follows.

What problem are you trying to solve  
with this book?
Business is facing a trust crisis. The 2021 Edelman 
Trust Barometer showed that business was actually 
the most highly rated institution, and it garnered  
61 percent trust. Government, for example, was at 
53 percent. But as business people, if we step  
back and say, “How do we feel about 61 percent of 
respondents saying they trust us,” it’s not such  
a great score. And so trust is when we are willing to 
enter into a relationship of vulnerability with 
someone—or an organization—that has power  
over us.

There was a great study of NCAA basketball  
players, and what the study found was that the team 
that had the highest trust in its coach had the 
highest number of wins, and the team that had the

lowest trust in its coach had the lowest score. What 
this adds up to is a question for business, which is 
how does a company gain trust? Shalene Gupta and 
I wrote this book to try to help people understand 
how trust is built and how to regain it if it’s lost.

Trust in the COVID-19-era workplace

How has the pandemic impacted trust? 
I think that there are two dimensions on which things 
have gotten more focused: the first is companies’ 
responsibilities for safety. This is kind of a new topic, 
so unless you’re in extractive industries or something 
where there are big machines wandering around, 
and people in them, it’s not something that compa-
nies have had to worry about before. But now  
what you see on every website is, “Here’s how we’re 
keeping our employees safe. Here’s how we’re  
trying to keep our customers safe.”

This is a new and ongoing responsibility that really  
is at the heart of trust, because people are trusting 
companies with their lives, whether they’re the 
customers or the employees. The other thing that’s 
going on is that people have started to think  
more about their relationship to work. We actually 
are at a point where we need to knit organizations 
back together. 

And I would probably ask three questions: First, I’d 
want to know what COVID has felt like for the people 
inside my firm, and I’d want to find out what their 
experience of COVID has been. I’d want to know how 
well they thought we’d done as a company at 
actually managing the COVID challenge on their 
behalf and others. And I’d want to know what kind of 
areas they think we could do a better job in. 

On the internal versus external trust challenge:
One of the basic principles that we found about trust 
is that trust is built from the inside out. It’s almost 
impossible to imagine a company being able to be 
trusted by its customers if it’s not trusted by its 
employees. Like any other business process, there 
are steps you have to follow in order to truly regain 
trust. All of these go against the normal playbook in 
companies attending to legal matters first, and 

Author Talks: The collection‘ It’s almost impossible to imagine  
a company being able to be trusted  
by its customers if it’s not trusted by  
its employees.’

really not attending to these trust issues. It’s not that 
the cost and liability issues related to a scandal 
aren’t huge; it’s more that regaining trust is a 
different goal, and if you want a different outcome, 
you have to work a different process. 

responsible—really responsible—for what goes on 
be held accountable. And then the third step is a 
long-term strategy for trying to fix what caused the 
breach in the first place.

The first step of the process is to take responsibility 
for the harm you’ve created and to apologize for it. 
So I apologize, myself, to all the lawyers in the room 
who are screaming at this point, “Don’t do that!”  
But in fact, trust has a moral domain, and one of the 
most important elements is people’s ability to take 
responsibility for the impacts that they cause. That’s 
one of the foundational elements on which we trust 
companies and other individuals. So the first thing 
you have to do is to actually say, “We did this  
thing, we know it’s wrong, and we’re so sorry for  
the problems that we caused.”

The second step—and this gets hard—is to fix 
account ability for what was wrong. Now, this is a 
place where most companies pull back and they  
say, “Well, you know, it was those people down at 
the bottom who did these things.” But people’s 
demand for fairness is that they know the companies 
are hierarchies, and they reasonably, in a moral 
sense, hold the person at the top of that hierarchy 
responsible for what happens on his or her watch.

Now, there’s actually some interesting research that 
says that you can punish CEOs and get the same 
effect, like take away some compensation. But what 
people care about is that the person who is 

So it’s these three steps: apologize, fix accountability, 
and manage the long-term foundational issues that 
created the breach in the first place.  

Which trust-building stories work best?
One tactic, and it was surprising to me, was the role 
sustainability reporting can play in getting a 
company’s story out. Now, some companies are 
really good in their sustainability reporting, at  
saying, “Here’s the strategy, here are the things that 
matter, here are the stakeholders we’re trying to 
satisfy, here’s measurable progress that we’re mak-
ing, and here are things that we still need to do.”

The other is to remember that the first audience is 
inside the organization. If trust is built from the inside 
out, the people who really need to understand what 
you’ve done, and what you’re doing to make good on 
what happened, are the people inside the company.

So even if none of this got to the outside, if you have 
a credible story, and data to back it up, about the 
issues that you found and what you’re doing about 
them, and the positive things that have come out  
of that, that will go a very long way to helping people 
juice the company back into some state where it  
can regain trust on the outside.

The case for taking a stand—or not

On weighing in or staying out of it:
There are a couple of dimensions of trust. One’s just 
competence. No one’s going to ever trust a company 
that’s not good at what it does. But there are  
three dimensions in the moral domain that people 
care about greatly. They care about the motives  
of a company—which is whose interests are they 
really serving. They care about whether the 
company uses fair means to achieve its goals. And 
they care deeply about the impact that the 
company has, the real impact that people see on the 
ground regardless of what the company says. 

So let’s think about how companies make these 
judgments about whether or not they’re going to get 
involved in something. The first thing that we know is 
that there will always be backlash from the 
disappointed group—particularly because these are 
moral questions that are largely being debated.  
On the one hand, you try to do the best that you can 
to satisfy the interests of people who think 
differently about the topic. But for some of these 
issues, like voting rights and Black Lives Matter,  
at the end, it’s a moral judgment on the part of the 
company where you know that you’re going to  
tick some people off, and you may even suffer some 
legislative setbacks and new taxes that could  
be levied on you because people are ticked off with 
what you’ve done. Nonetheless, trust is a domain  
of who we want to be as a company, right? And it’s 
those defining moments that help a company. 

That does not mean that companies need to weigh  
in on every single issue. Number one, there are too 
many, and number two, only some of them either 
touch their heart or are ones where people expect 
them to take a stand. So I think the first thing to  
say is, “Is there a place where I feel I should be making 
a stand?” It’s one place where I think the boards  
can actually be helpful, if they can be open minded 
about weighing what is really going on. The bottom 
line is that, because these are moral calls, there are 
going to be people who disagree.

On global organizations and regional issues:
Global companies always have this question about 
what’s the same and what’s different, and I think 
that’s also true with this dimension of trust. And I 
think that if a [regional] issue hasn’t bled over to 
other countries where you are doing business, it is 
important to let everyone [in the organization]  
know about it so that they are prepared if asked 
about it. 

So first you solve [the issue] at the country level: you 
work inside the firm to make people understand 
what it is that you’ve done so they won’t be surprised 
if they get asked. But you also have a good reason 
for saying this is why we think [the issue] is limited to 
this one country, and this is why we don’t think this  
is an issue for us globally.

Joann S. Lublin on 
lessons for working

Joann S. Lublin looks at the trade-offs mothers are too often forced

of large-scale paid parental leave.

Talent, culture, and change management

McKinsey Global Publishing’s Raju Narisetti spoke 
with Joann S. Lublin, former management news 
editor for the Wall Street Journal. In her new book, 
Power Moms: How Executive Mothers Navigate 
Work and Life (HarperCollins, February 2021), the 
Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist draws on the 
experiences of two generations of successful 
women—boomers and Gen Xers— to measure how 
far we’ve come and how far we still need to go. An 
edited version of the conversation follows.

What problem were you trying to solve with  
this book? 
The root problem I was trying to solve was to 
determine to what extent the “motherhood penalty” 
still exists. The motherhood penalty takes a lot of 
forms. It was initially documented back in 2007, 
when researchers found that if you submitted a 
résumé in which it was clear that the résumé was 
coming from a woman with children, she was much 
less likely to be called for an interview than either a 
man with children, or men and women whose 
résumés made it clear that they had no children.

moved into executive roles? And what I found was 
that it has indeed, to some extent, but that the 
women still suffer from gendered role expectations.

What surprised you most about writing the book—
whether in the research or response? 
When interviewing the 86 executive mothers for this 
book, some of them cried or choked up during the 
course of the interviews. And they turned tearful for 
lots of different reasons, sometimes when they were 
recounting ugly quarrels with their husbands, whom 
they were separated from.

Other cases, it was because they were being  
treated poorly as women on the job. Some of them 
got choked up when they were feeling guilty about 
those frequent business trips they took when their 
kids were little. And obviously, when there was a  
big health crisis with a family member, whether it 
was a child or an aging parent or their own life-
threatening health condition, some of them choked 
up about that.

And that motherhood penalty, from a hiring 
standpoint and employment standpoint, still 
persists. In fact, the wage gap between women with 
children under 18 and dads with children under 18 is 
about 69 cents earned by the mother for every dollar 
earned by the dad—a much wider gap than exists 
between women and men [generally].

So the question that I was trying to explore was, has 
the motherhood penalty diminished at all as these 
younger executive mothers, women who were in 
their 30s and early 40s when I interviewed them, 

You say it’s important to accept the 
imperfections. Why is that? 
Accepting our imperfections doesn’t mean that you 
stop trying to be the best you can be, especially if 
you’re cognizant of the workplace in which you are 
operating. For individuals, that means you accept 
the fact that you’re imperfect and accept the fact 
that there are going to be cases in which you are 
held to a higher standard, but you may not be able to 
meet those standards. You just do your darned best.
And what it means for employers is that we need to 
be having mandatory and regular unconscious-bias 
training, so we understand the ways in which men 

‘Accept the fact that you’re imperfect

Author Talks: The collectionand women alike put themselves in boxes. I think 
men are equally subject to stereotypical 
expectations—it’s why we see a relatively low 
percentage of men take paid parental leave when 
it’s available.

When I moved from Chicago to Washington for the 
Wall Street Journal, when I was seven months 
pregnant with our first child, and my husband 
essentially followed me, the guys in the Journal 
office kind of laughed at my husband, that he would 
be so dumb as to follow his wife’s career.

The juggling act called life

How can companies help with the notion of  
‘work–life sway’?  
Well, I think for starters, employers need to 
understand what the concept is. When I started 
reporting for this book and began meeting with the 
younger executive mothers, women in their 30s and 
early 40s, the very first woman I met said, “By the 
way, have you heard of work–life sway?” I said, “Is 
that like work–life balance?” “No,” she replied.
The whole idea of work–life sway is that we accept 
as a given that when we need to be 110 percent 
there for our jobs, for our employers, we will do so, 
but if life interferes and we’ve got to do something 
that deals with our family, we will move out of work 
mode and move into family mode.

So how can this concept apply to employers? Now 
that we’ve had this successful natural experiment in 
working from home, I think employers can make a 
permanent commitment to letting individuals work 
from home, either part-time or full-time, and in so 
doing, they can trust those individuals, particularly 
those who have parenting responsibilities, to figure 
out what time of day works best for them to work, 
and to allow, for instance, protected periods of time 
during the day.

Some companies during the pandemic have chosen 
to end the work day at the same time that school 
ends, because whether you’re educating your kids 
from home or they’re physically back in school, you 
are still working from home, and frankly, it gets a 
little chaotic around 3:30 p.m.

The other thing is that you need to show empathy by 
checking in frequently. Even if you yourself have 
children, they may not be as young or as vulnerable 
as [the children of] some of the employees that are 
working for you, and you need to be asking those 
working dads and moms, “Am I doing everything that 
you need, from your point of view, that enables you 
to be as effective and efficient as you possibly can?” 

Did you find any distinctions among women of 
color in your research?  
The 16 women of color were among the 86 executive 
mothers. One distinction was that among the women 
of color, the common thread I noticed was that they 
were, to a great extent, more able to rely on 
extended family to help with childcare issues than 
white women were.  A really great example of this 
involved Inhi Cho Suh, who is an IBM executive and a 
younger-generation mom. She was born in South 
Korea and immigrated here with her parents when 
she was five. About a decade ago, she and her 
husband had an opportunity to relocate to the New 
York suburban area, so they would both take jobs at 
IBM. The problem was that they didn’t know anyone 
where they were moving to, and they didn’t have any 
local relatives, so she reached out to her parents, 
both of whom at that point had their own small 
businesses, and asked them for help. They agreed to 
sell their businesses and move in with Inhi, her 
husband, and their two sons, and essentially 
became a second set of parents to their grandsons.

When Inhi talked about how her mother explained 
why she did this, she choked up. Her mother said, 
“My sun is setting and yours is rising,” and that was 
why she was willing to sell her business, and why 
Inhi’s father was willing to sell his business.  

Generational wisdom

Are there lessons for power daughters? 
Yes, I think there are many lessons for the daughters 
of power moms, and the daughters of future power 
moms. And one is that you’ve got a secret resource 
there. So many of these boomer mothers ended up 
being informal career coaches for their daughters as 
they reached adulthood.

the dedication.” And at that point, the dedication 
said, “To my mother, Betty Lublin. She’s always been 
my biggest supporter in my role as a working mom.”

And she said, “Oh, no, that will not do. I wasn’t always 
your biggest supporter. There were lots of things 
that I didn’t like about how you were doing this.” And 
she was right. When I was pregnant with my son, she 
said to me, “Of course you’re going to now quit 
journalism and become a teacher,” to which I replied, 
“Why would I want to do that?” And she said, “So you 
can have your summers off.”

And so I said, “OK, Mom, I’ll rewrite the dedication. I’ll 
say, ‘She was always my biggest supporter and my 
biggest critic for my role as a working mom.’” She 
replied, “No, reverse it.” I think she would get a big 
kick out of the book. I think she really would.

And frankly, the daughters could not care less when 
they were in high school, and often throughout 
college. In fact, they resented the way mom was 
trying to micromanage their selection of college, and 
what they were going to major in, and what field they 
were going to go into afterwards.

But you know what? These moms had figured out 
how to make it in the corporate world, and to the 
extent their daughters wanted to be in the corporate 
world, they ought to take advantage of her 
knowledge, her experience, her networking skills, 
her connections, and her ability to figure out what is 
or isn’t going right when they get into that job. 

How do you think your mother would have 
responded to your book?   
Well, it’s very ironic that you should ask that 
question, because the last time I saw my mom was 
around this time last year, when I visited her in her 
assisted-living facility in Atlanta. At that point, I was 
nearing completion of the book, but obviously she 
never got to read it. I said, “Mom, this book will be 
dedicated to you,” to which she replied, “Read me

Michelle Duster on the legacy of Ida B. Wells

97

In a conversation with McKinsey Global Publishing 
Director Raju Narisetti, Michelle Duster, a writer, 
professor, and champion of racial and gender 
equality, discussed her new book, Ida B. The Queen: 
The Extraordinary Life and Legacy of Ida B. Wells 
(One Signal Publishers/Atria Publishing Group, 
January 2021). In the book, Wells pays tribute to her 
great-grandmother Ida B. Wells, a pioneering 
woman who was often overlooked and 
underestimated. An edited version of the 
conversation follows.

What were you hoping your book would add to  
the well-known story of Wells? 
I really wanted to share and celebrate her truth and 
her enduring legacy with a new generation. And my 
hope is that readers will be inspired by her story and 
galvanized to continue to fight for a better world. I 
also wanted to help people understand the 
connection between the past and the present and, 
hopefully, see themselves in my great-
grandmother’s story.

What surprised you the most when  
researching for the book, which is also your own 
family history? 
One thing that I learned while I was researching for 
Ida B. the Queen is how much my family was 
surveilled by the FBI. I found the FBI files on my 
great-grandmother. And I really wanted to 
incorporate that into the book to give people a sense 
of what my great-grandmother’s life was like, but 
also how it has impacted my family to have 
somebody surveilled by the government.

In light of a tumultuous year for racial justice  
in America, what about Wells’s life should  
be highlighted? 
Ida B. Wells was a trailblazing journalist. She was an 
antilynching crusader and a suffragist. She was a 
civil-rights icon. She cofounded several organizations, 
including the Alpha Suffrage Club, the NAACP, and 

the Negro Fellowship League. She was a social 
worker. She had multiple careers during her lifetime.

Her quest was always to give full citizenship rights 
to Black Americans and women. And she was very 
successful in some ways. During her lifetime, 
women did gain the right to vote with the 19th 
Amendment. But she was 58 years old when that 
happened; most of her life, she did not have the 
right to vote. 

She also experienced great progress during her 
lifetime, especially after slavery ended. During 
Reconstruction, she had the right to become 
formally educated. So she saw a lot of progress, but 
she also saw a lot of backlash to and violence toward 
Black Americans’ progress. And we continue some 
of those struggles today.

What enabled Wells to be positive in the face  
of adversity in what was—and still is—an uphill 
battle for justice? 
I think my great-grandmother was, inherently, an 
optimist. And one of the things I’m hoping people will 
get from Ida B. the Queen is her sense of optimism 
combined with indignation. She believed that 
challenging systems—by truth-telling, by exposing 
inequality—would lead to, ultimately, some kind of 
systemic change.

What can Wells’s life and this book teach us about 
accelerating progress for Black women today? 
There has been progress for Black women from 
1862, when my great-grandmother was born, until 
2020. I have way more opportunities than my great-
grandmother did. 

We can probably name the number of Black women 
who are in high levels of corporate management in a 
very short list, compared with the number of white 
men at those levels in 2020. For me, that shows 
heroic accomplishments by those individual women

because, from my experience, the women who are 
advancing to these levels run circles around their 
competition. They have to be so much better, so 
much more qualified. The level of excellence that 
Black women have to exhibit is at a higher standard 
than what I have seen other people need to achieve. 

And that, to me, is not a change—a systemic 
change when it comes to equality—it’s women’s 
individual efforts that just makes them stand out so 
much. And until we get to a point where everybody 
is measured by the same criterion, we’ll still be 
dealing with inequality.

Mia Bay on traveling Black

In a new book, Mia Bay explores when, how, and why racial restrictions took 
shape and what it was like to live with them. 

Author Talks: The collectionRaju Narisetti, director of McKinsey Global 
Publishing, and Mia Bay, the Roy F. and Jeannette P. 
Nichols Professor of American History at the 
University of Pennsylvania, talked about her new 
book, Traveling Black: A Story of Race and 
Resistance (Harvard University Press, March 2021). 
From stagecoaches and trains to buses, cars, and 
planes, Traveling Black explains why the long, 
unfinished journey to racial equality so often takes 
place on the road. An edited version of their 
conversation follows.

And then, as I wanted to know more about how 
segregation took shape and operated over time and 
on different forms of transportation, I discovered all 
sorts of things that kind of blew my mind. For 
instance, I did a lot of word searches on “Jim Crow 
cars.” I noticed fairly early on that, especially in Black 
newspapers, people often were sort of counting out 
how many people died in train crashes, Black versus 
white. And I thought, “Well, why are they keeping 
track of the racial demographics of train crashes? 
That seems odd.”

What were some of the issues you were hoping to 
address for your readers with this book? 
The gap between the American dream and the 
American reality—the myth of the open road does 
speak to something that’s actually central to the 
American experience, which is mobility, moving 
around, traveling for work, being dispersed from 
your families. But it also has a kind of mythology of 
being able to travel easily, being welcome wherever 
you go. Which is actually limited to certain people 
and not others.

The roadblocks to freedom

What surprised you most in researching this  
topic over the years? 
It was a book I never really planned to write. It was 
just a subject I became curious about. I first was 
surprised to learn when I was working on the 
biography of Ida B. Wells—a 19th century Black 
woman and antilynching activist—that one of the 
things that kind of got her into activism and 
journalism was that she was kicked out of a ladies’ 
[train] car in Tennessee in the early 1880s.

This was before you had formal legal segregation, 
and the divisions among passenger cars used to be 
between ladies’ cars and smoking cars. So I became 
curious about how you went from ladies’ cars to Jim 
Crow cars. I hadn’t really thought about how 
segregation took shape.

I eventually realized it was because, as the railroads 
began to move from all-wooden passenger cars to 
new metal passenger cars, they were using the older 
cars as Jim Crow cars, which meant, over the turn of 
the century, between let’s say the late 1890s and as 
late as 1950, there were a lot of train crashes in 
which most of the people who died or were injured 
were riding in the Jim Crow cars.

And that was something that African Americans 
knew at the time and protested, but it just never got 
any traction. So that really surprised me, and it took 
me a while to even understand what they were 
talking about. 

I was also amazed to find that there was an attempt 
to have racial rules of the road at one point, in the 
Deep South. They initially thought that when people 
got to a traffic light, Blacks should basically wait for 
white drivers to go [first].

This was not a viable system of traffic regulation. 
Four-way stops, for example, were kind of a disaster, 
especially if you had a mix of people at them. So it 
didn’t really work out. But there was an attempt to 
have it. And there were certain customs, like Blacks 
weren’t supposed to pass whites on dusty roads.

Mia Bay on traveling Black

101

‘I think that we need to find ways to 
think about traveling, be it commuting 
or long-distance traveling, as a right 
that we need to protect.’

On cars, “at best, as mixed blessing for  
African Americans”: 
The automobile was greeted with real enthusiasm by 
African Americans who really hoped that it would be 
a shelter from segregation. It started to pose 
problems fairly early on. Automobiles, once you use 
them for transportation, as opposed to riding around 
town, require you to have gas stations, hotels, 
motels, and roadside restaurants. And all of that 
would often be segregated. So, in many ways, 
automobile travel became more segregated over 
time: restrooms in gas stations were often off-limits 
to Blacks. In some places, the use of the gas station 
was off-limits to Blacks because gas station owners 
were trying to market themselves to an audience—
they imagined these white women drivers that 
needed to be comfortable and find that the gas 
station was homey and safe. So they would kind of 
discourage Black patronage.

And these kind of problems would just multiply over 
time so that, while African Americans did continue to 
love automobiles in a certain way, and continue to 
sometimes find them preferable to trains and buses, 
where they had many problems, they also had to do 
things like plan their trips in advance so that they 
could have places to stay, usually with friends, 
because there were a very limited number of hotels 
[for people of color].

They had to figure out where the places they could 
eat were, where the gas stations were that would 
serve people of color. They had to find out where it 

was dangerous to drive, where it was safer to drive. 
So automobiles were challenging in their own way. 
And the kinds of dangers that they could pose are 
still familiar to us today. Blacks traveling through the 
South, in particular, were worried about being 
stopped by the police. They were worried about 
white hostility. All of these things could make 
automobile traveling dangerous.

On the lack of affordable parking through a 
racial-inequity prism: 
There was sometimes segregated parking in the 
South. Some towns had a rule that only whites could 
park on Main Street on Saturday, which was the big 
shopping day, because they wanted Blacks to do 
their shopping on another day.

There were work areas where whites had the paved 
parking and Blacks had the unpaved parking, and 
beaches with segregated parking areas. That 
underscores what is still true today, which is that 
parking is closely associated with money and status. 
And it aggravates transportation inequities.

A lot of people who can’t afford to live in New York 
work there. And they often live quite far away and 
might choose to drive into Manhattan. But they can’t 
because parking is just completely out of the 
question. Meanwhile, people who actually live in 
inner-city areas, if they want a job for work, have to 
calculate the cost of a parking space, which makes it 
prohibitive for many people.

it’s one that’s off limits to many people of color, 
which is one reason why levels of car ownership are 
lower among Blacks and Hispanics.

The right to mobility

On social media, where hashtags such as “driving 
while black” and “traveling while black” remind 
us that American citizens trying to travel freely 
remains a civil rights issue, especially if you’re  
not white: 
I think that we need to find ways to think about 
traveling, be it commuting or long-distance traveling, 
as a right that we need to protect. That people 
should have access to transportation, that it should 
be equitable transportation, that there shouldn’t  
be entire groups of people who are simply left out  
of mobility.

I think that that point was made abundantly clear 
during Hurricane Katrina, when we saw all those 
people stranded in the Superdome. They were 
people who lived in New Orleans who did not own 
cars. The city had not really made a plan for anyone 
who didn’t own cars.

It had a plan that redirected highway traffic out of 
the city, allowing people who had cars or could get 
rides to drive. But if you didn’t have a car, there was 
no plan for how you would leave New Orleans. 

Transportation is a fundamental service, but in this 
country, we often don’t think of it that way. We don’t 
have a huge commitment to infrastructure or making 
places accessible to people who don’t drive. All of 
this is also going to collide, of course, with the 
ongoing climate-change issues. It would be a good 
idea for the nation, generally, if we became less 
dependent on cars and found ways to move people 
around that involve things like buses and other 
forms of transportation that aren’t so hard on the 
environment.

On your quote “no need to travel back in time to 
travel Black”:  
I think it illustrates the challenges and some of the 
things that we need to think about that tend to be 
invisible. We often don’t spend that much time 
thinking about how people got from place to place.

One of the striking things to me in researching the 
book was how many whites, including whites in 
leadership during the segregation era, were 
unaware of the kind of difficulties Blacks 
experienced while traveling, because they, 
themselves, didn’t experience them. For instance, 
President Lyndon B. Johnson was surprised when 
he asked a Black family that worked for him to 
transport one of his dogs to Texas, and they refused. 
And he just didn’t understand why. He was finally 
told it was because it’s hard enough to travel cross 

‘Transportation is a fundamental service, 
but in this country, we often don’t think 
of it that way.’

traveling by plane. I wasn’t sure that there were 
forms of segregation or that I could find any 
evidence of them.

These are the kind of things that people don’t think 
about. I worry that, during the [COVID-19] pandemic, 
those of us who can afford to avoid public 
transportation for health and safety reasons  
are not thinking enough about those who can’t.

We already know that funding for public 
transportation is in crisis. So we have things like the 
New York City public transportation system losing 
riders. So if we back away from commitments to 
public transportation, this would be particularly 
damaging to people who can’t afford cars.

It’s also really a terrible time in the history of our 
planet to up our commitment to cars. So we need  
to be thinking about all those things. And we  
need to be thinking about them in terms of helping 
all people move through the world in a way that is 
safe and equitable and, hopefully, not too damaging 
to the planet.

On segregation and air travel 
I had no idea about [segregation on] planes. In fact, 
when I started writing the book with that chapter, I 
wasn’t sure I could actually write a chapter on 

Then it became clear that there was a complex 
history of segregation on actual planes. And then a 
very clear history of segregation in airports and 
segregation at all the kinds of support facilities that 
you need to use planes, from taxicabs to airport 
hotels. That really affected early fliers. Many Blacks 
who first started using planes were, once again, 
excited. They would avoid segregation because it 
wasn’t really that widely practiced in the air. 

But then they would land at an airport and be 
completely unable to get a cab, or there would be a 
layover, and there would be no hotel for them. So all 
of these things were actually really difficult for Black 
air travelers.

Any early response that has surprised you to  
the book? 
I’ve been interested and gratified by how much 
people want to use it to talk about modern-day 
transportation inequities. That is not necessarily  
my expertise. I’m glad that people are thinking  
about that.

In a discussion with McKinsey Global Publishing’s 
Eleni Kostopoulos, Peter Gumbel, editorial director 
of the McKinsey Global Institute, spoke about his 
latest book, Citizens of Everywhere: Searching for 
Identity in the Age of Brexit (Haus Publishing, 
2020). The Paris-based, award-winning journalist 
draws on his family’s migration stories to explore 
the nature of belonging amid cycles of pluralism 
and nationalism. An edited version of the  
interview follows.

History is a great teacher

What surprised you most about writing  
this book—whether in the research, writing,  
or response?
A large stash of documents relating to my mother’s 
family going back three generations formed the bulk 
of my historical research. The most poignant are 
letters my grandfather wrote to his business 
contacts around Europe in October 1938, searching 
for a job that would enable him to leave Germany. 

What are the key issues you want to raise in  
this book?
In these unsettled times, many individuals and 
companies are taking a closer look at their values 
and purpose. This book-length essay is my 
personal exploration of those questions. It focuses 
on the essential issues of identity and belonging. 

The starting point was my decision to acquire a new 
European nationality after the UK’s Brexit 
referendum in 2016. I live in Paris and, as a British 
citizen, I would have faced bureaucratic hassles to 
be able to continue working here after Britain 
withdrew from the European Union. I also would 
have lost my freedom of movement across the rest 
of the EU. 

My grandparents were stripped of their German 
nationality when they fled Nazi Germany in 1939, 
and, under the postwar German constitution, that 
made me eligible to apply for German citizenship. 
Doing so meant closing an 80-year cycle of family 
history—and that required a lot of soul-searching. I 
needed to take a close look at myself and my 
values, as well as at the reality of both Germany 
and Britain today. The exercise was well worth the 
effort. I feel that I have brought closure to a part of 
my family history that was so painful it remained  
taboo for many years. At the same time, it gave  
me a better understanding of the changing nature 
of identity in our digital age, and made me 
appreciate all the more the values of freedom, 
tolerance, and justice that my grandparents 
yearned for in their darkest hours.

He knew his situation was dire: he had just put his 
son on a Kindertransport train to get him out of 
Germany to an unknown destination and had 
essentially given away the family company to avoid 
it being confiscated. He didn’t yet know it, but he 
would be arrested during the Kristallnacht pogrom 
on November 9, 1938. Yet reading his letters, you 
can only guess at the drama of his situation. He 
writes in a very controlled and genteel way that 
betrays almost no hint of emotion. During the ten 
days he spent in jail, my grandmother followed up 
with the correspondence, but she gave almost 
nothing away about her very real worries. No 
matter how often I read those letters, I continue to 
find that extraordinary. 

You write that “mobility is freedom.” How has the 
COVID-19 crisis threatened that freedom?
You often only truly appreciate something when 
you lose it. Early in my career, I worked as a 
journalist in the Soviet Union and experienced 
Berlin, both West and East, before the fall of the 
wall. That left me with a heightened sense of the 
importance of free movement. 

With COVID-19, our ability to move has 
understandably been restricted: during the 
lockdowns in France, we can’t go far from our 
homes and need a written justification for why we 
are out. That is claustrophobic, and it has made me 
appreciate all the more the extraordinary freedom 
of movement we have enjoyed in Europe over the 
past 35 years, ever since the Schengen Agreement

A critical question once this pandemic abates is 
whether we will be able to return to the way it was 
beforehand. That’s important not just for our own 
personal ability to move around Europe, but also for 
trade and the economy more broadly. 

based on their passions and idea of self, whether it 
be for golf, chess, vegan recipes, or book collecting. 
You can be a member of a British-born Chinese-
food group or an Irish Latvian-folk-dancing 
community, or both at the same time. 

The seamless cross-border flow of goods, services, 
finance, and people is a key achievement of the 
European Union, and in my opinion, it is essential to 
maintain and strengthen it. But not everyone shares 
that view, and with the pandemic, the pressures to 
curtail freedom of movement will only increase.

Social media: Friend or foe?

In many ways, your book is about the nature of 
belonging. How has social media changed the 
way we shape our identities and, subsequently, 
how we belong?
The social history of the past half century in the US 
and Europe has been marked by personal 
empowerment and, increasingly, by the assertion of 
multiple identities, from our gender and sexuality to 
our ethnic or religious background, and even our 
dietary habits. The internet and social media in 
particular have amplified and accelerated these 
trends. These technologies are the great cross-
border connectors that enable the unencumbered 
expression of our multiplicity. They link people 

It just takes seconds to upload a video, photo, or 
comment and disseminate it worldwide. In this 
context, I argue that national identity has lost some 
of its relevance. It is as if our user IDs and 
passwords for services like Facebook, Twitter, and 
Instagram have become as important as our 
passports in determining who we are and the 
company we keep. As we have seen, these 
networks are also breeding grounds of 
misinformation and abuse, and they can destroy 
self-confidence as easily as they build it up. Yet we 
are hooked. 

Igniting purpose 

You write about the importance of fighting for 
the principles of diversity, of tolerance, and of 
openness. What advice would you give to 
corporations that are on a quest to weave these 
principles into their DNA? 
To be credible, you have to go beyond principles 
and put in place very tangible measures. For 
diversity, that starts with recruiting—but we also

and certainly more effective than

know that it doesn’t stop there; all too often, 
diversity at the entry level doesn’t lead to more 
diverse middle or senior management. You need to 
take a close look at the obstacles to promotion and 
address them head-on. Fostering greater 
tolerance and openness are primarily questions of 
management style and values. You can achieve 
that with a focus on teamwork and creativity, but 
they need to take place in a context of 
nonhierarchical leadership. Being open to other 
ideas and respecting other opinions needs to be 
the rule rather than the exception. 

The biggest lesson for me from my own family 
history is that multiple small steps can be 
powerful—and certainly more effective than 
grandiose declarations that are not followed up.  

My great-grandfather, a highly successful 
entrepreneur who built a textile business in the late 
19th century, saw it as self-evident that he needed 
to spread the wealth he created, both to his 
workers and to the German community in which he 
lived. He set up a health insurance plan for all 
employees, subsidized a local children’s hospital, 
and funded city parks and the construction of a 
beautiful art deco theater that still stands. Some 
120 years later, stakeholder capitalism is back on 
the corporate agenda, and the principles of respect 
and community that guided him are as relevant and 
necessary as ever.

with resilience.

Roger Martin on the high price of efficiency

109

Finance and economics

McKinsey Senior Editor Diane Brady chatted 
with Roger Martin, professor emeritus and former 
dean of the Rotman School of Management at 
the University of Toronto, about his latest book, 
When More Is Not Better: Overcoming America’s 
Obsession with Economic Efficiency (Harvard 
Business Review Press, September 2020). The 
noted management thinker points to a short-term 
focus on maximizing shareholder returns as a root 
cause of inequality and economic instability. An 
edited version of the conversation follows.

What problem are you trying to solve with  
this book?
Median incomes in the US are stagnating. People 
tend to focus on economic growth and GDP per 
capita, which is the mean or average growth.  
What I was worried about was a divergence 
between the two as more and more of the new 
economic growth went into the pockets of the very 
rich. When they think of inequality, most people 
think, “Poor people are getting poorer.” That’s not 
actually the case. Though I care a whole lot about 
the poor and how poor they are, they aren’t getting 
poorer relative to the median. That’s stayed quite 
stable. What has been completely unstable and 
going in one direction is the median versus the 
top 1 percent and the top 10 percent. That was the 
motivator for the book. I was trying to figure out, 
“Why? What’s changed?”

What surprised you most about the book? 
The thing that probably surprised me most was 
the result of the Persona Project, a project we 
did where we interviewed, in ethnographic detail, 
a bunch of Americans. And the disengagement 
was startling. The primary-school teacher saying, 
“Hey, I got a teacher’s degree. I thought that was 
what you’re supposed to do. And here I am, barely 
making ends meet.” It’s more cause to ask, “Is 
this system working?” One of the things that I 
think has been good for the country coming out of 
the pandemic is the notion of all these essential 
workers. They’re essential, but they don’t make a 
living wage. So how exactly does that work? It’s 
not sustainable for an entity to do business in a 
way that people who are essential to that business 
aren’t benefiting from it. Living paycheck to 
paycheck, below a living wage, and worrying about 
putting food on the table does not make for an 
employee who can give awesome service.

A take on tech

Is technology a tool for speed, or is it creating 
more obstacles to resiliency?
I think it’s creating more obstacles, probably. 
Aristotle, who created the scientific method, 
explained something really important that the world 
has ignored: if you’re going to use the scientific 
method, it involves crunching data to determine 
the cause of a given effect. Where’s all the data 

‘To prioritize one thing and say, “This  
is the one thing we’re about,” is a recipe 
for disaster. In a complex, adaptive  
system, that’s pulling one lever and 
imagining that you know what that  
one lever is going to do.’

110

Author Talks: The collection‘We’re not going to get where we need 
to be on diversity until such time as we 
make the most of diverse voices instead 
of the least.’ 

from? The past. We have no data on the future yet, 
because it hasn’t happened. And what he said is 
that crunching data is only good for that part of the 
world where things cannot be other than they are. 
Take this pen. I can drop it 1,000 times in the past 
and calculate that it’ll drop in the future because 
it’s part of the world where things cannot be other 
than they are. Now, the problem with using scientific 
analysis in that world—machine learning, AI [artificial 
intelligence], and so on—is it will convince you 
that the future will be what? Identical to the past. 
Because that’s all science can do—the guy who 
invented science told us that. 

What should a CEO with limited  
resources prioritize?
One is to prioritize multiple things. To prioritize one 
thing and say, “This is the one thing we’re about,” is 
a recipe for disaster. In a complex, adaptive system, 
that’s pulling one lever and imagining that you know 
what that one lever is going to do. Two, ask the 
sustainability question: “Who is necessary for this 
business system we’re trying to put together? Who’s 
necessary for this to prosper? What’s in it for them?” 
And make sure that it’s good for everybody else 
because, otherwise, it is not sustainable; because 
you’re counting on somebody who is not benefiting 
from the system you’ve put in place. And then just 
keep tweaking it and tweaking it. Don’t imagine you 
can put a system in place and it’ll run for any period 
of time, let alone forever. 

Diversity is key to resiliency

What’s the recipe for a mindset of resiliency? 
I guess I would do an overlay. Philosophy feels to 
me like the most foundational discipline about how 
people work, and physics is how things work. You 
need to know how things and people interact to get 
ahead in life. I think the great philosophers were 
system-dynamics people, in essence. They were 
essentially saying, “We are going to explain to you 
how this thing called ‘people interacting together’ 
kind of works.” They were more holistic.  

We are not taught how to take advantage of a 
diverse thought—diverse in the sense that your 
thought conflicts with mine—rather than saying,  
“I have an idea. Yours is different than mine. I must 
make sure mine triumphs,” which is generally  
what we’re taught to do, to advocate for our point 
of view.

We’re not going to get where we need to be on 
diversity until such time as we make the most of 
diverse voices instead of the least. Right now,  
we make the least of them. And that’s often why  
if you have 20 people and there are two or three 
who are thinking differently, they’re likely to feel 
that they’re being squashed. We have been on a 
path of reductionism—and this idea that you can 
prove things.

Gregory B. Fairchild on 
the next frontier in racial 
equality

In his new book, Gregory Fairchild shows the power of treating  
underserved communities as emerging markets.

112

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey Global Publishing’s Diane Brady 
chatted with Gregory Fairchild, Isidore Horween 
Research Professor of Business Administration 
at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of 
Business. In his new book, Emerging Domestic 
Markets: How Financial Entrepreneurs Reach 
Underserved Communities in the United States 
(Columbia Business School Publishing, January 
2021), Fairchild introduces readers to the rising 
set of entrepreneurs whose efforts to reach 
marginalized groups are reshaping the emerging 
markets of the United States. An edited version of 
the interview follows.

What problem are you trying to solve with  
this book? 
The book, and what I’m talking about in terms of 
a solution, is a way of thinking about a financial-
services system. And by financial services, I don’t 
just mean credit cards or checking accounts 
and bank accounts. What I mean is a system that 
provides investments. And by investments, I mean 
commercial loans, mortgage loans.

And, yes, I do mean equity to individuals who 
are trying to make a difference in lower-income 
communities. That’s work that has been going on for 
decades, long before we had movements like ESG 
[environmental, social, and governance] investing, 
which is something we talk about now.

My work is about ways in which a system, by being 
more democratic, small “d,” can be one that helps 
solve some of the ongoing inequality, and some of the 
ongoing disparities in racial wealth, and some of the 
disparities in minority homeownership—and minority 
business ownership—that we see in our society.

Trends become opportunities 

What type of mindset is required to enter these 
emerging domestic markets?
The emerging domestic-market concept, which is 
one that I’ve been developing over the last decade 
and a half, is one that says, “Even without unrest, 
and without corporate pronouncements to do 
something in their communities, these markets 

are growing faster. They are experiencing income 
growth at rates we haven’t seen before. And they 
have fundamental characteristics that make them 
unserved opportunities that businesses and other 
investors can come along and participate in, just 
as they did years ago in those so-called foreign 
emerging markets.”

And so the notion is less charitable, not that the 
benefits of growth in those markets won’t be 
achieved, and won’t spill over to individuals who 
live in those communities. But the benefits that are 
derived aren’t necessarily through the mindset of 
coming with a handout. The benefits are coming to 
create a partnership and grow new institutions.

What surprised you most about writing this 
book—in the research, writing, or response? 
We were interested in whether a community 
development bank would tend to be more 
inefficient, more costly to run—because it was 
doing work in low-income areas—or whether 
it would be more likely to fail in an economic 
downturn. And so one of our studies looked at the 
period inclusive of the recent financial crisis of the 
2000s. And guess what? What we found was that 
pound for pound, dollar for dollar, asset for asset, 
community development banks were no more likely 
to fail, and were no less efficient, than banks of 
comparable size.

In fact, what we found is that in certain periods, they 
were less likely to fail. More recently, I’ve done some 
work looking at minority depository institutions. So 
these are banks and credit unions that focus on 
serving minority communities. They’re often run 
by minorities. These could be African Americans. 
These could be Latinx folks, these could be Native 
Americans, these can be Asian Americans. And 
these minority depository institutions are often 
serving low-income communities.

And guess what? Turns out, again, the finding is 
that those banks actually outperform, given their 
size and scope relative to other types of financial 
institutions. So not only are they less likely to fail, not 
only are they more efficient, but also if you looked at

‘I’d love for all of us to really think about

where they are, relatively speaking, they get far less 
in dollars, that is deposits and assets, than you’d 
think, given their performance.

as a result, I was able to be educated in communities 
in housing, and in places that were integrated from 
the time I started school.

The system isn’t frictionless

How did your own experience inform your 
research or focus in this book?
In this book, I share a number of experiences that 
I’ve had in the financial-services system. And I point 
out a set of benefits that I’ve had that accrued to 
me even before I was born. These were things that 
my grandparents and my parents were able to do, 
unlike many African Americans. My grandfather 
and grandmother served in World War II. They were 
able to get what’s now known as the GI Bill, or the 
Servicemen’s Readjustment Act loan.

And with that loan, they were able to buy a home 
in the 1940s that they raised my father in. And my 
father, as a benefit of having that asset, had a solidly 
middle-class life. Then, as my father became a man, 
grew up, and left home, he joined the US military.

And he joined the military and became an officer at 
a time when the military was instituting integration 
across the board—integration in housing, 
integration in schools, integration in facilities. And 

Many African Americans had neither the experience 
of my grandparents nor the experience I had, 
people my age, of having been in integrated school 
systems. I could go on. But what I try to do in the 
book throughout is to point out ways that I’ve had 
both challenges, because I’ve had challenges, and 
I’ve had advantages. And those challenges and the 
advantages accrue from structural factors, rather 
than from the benefit of my own individual labors. 
Or sometimes when we think about what we call 
inequalities in our markets, we think that the driving 
factor is discrimination.

And while that may be, and while that is an important 
discussion, what I’ve tried to do with my work is say 
that rather than ferret out and look for someone 
who’s vilified, or point to someone who’s been a 
deliberate discriminator, my work has said there are 
structural things that have nothing to do with one 
person’s animus that enables some of us to move 
through the system with ease and causes some of 
us lots of friction.

114

Author Talks: The collectionWhat would you have us do? Is there a call  
to action?  
One of the first things I’d like you to do is challenge 
your assumptions. You may not be right about the 
extent to which these risks or these inefficiencies or 
these bad behaviors are real. And I’d encourage you 
to come to this book with fresh eyes about asking 
yourself whether you’re right.

Next, I’d love all of us to really think about how 
we interact with financial-services systems, and 
whether there are things we can do to make sure 
that for those of us who have advantages in the 
system, we can ensure others do. And that could 
be putting deposits in institutions that operate in 
those communities.

There are some people who think banking is a 
bad-news industry that only cares about the 
rich. It doesn’t. And it doesn’t have to. And there 
are many individuals who are working in the field, 
they’re featured in the book, who do care about 

the rest of us. And if you’re one of the people who’s 
encouraged by that idea, and you think a nonprofit 
is the only place you might want to go, you could 
find your way to a broader base of financial 
institutions that could help be the change you’re 
looking for.

At the policy level, what I’d love to see is, while we 
think about income supports, we also think about 
ways of changing policy to help people right now 
during COVID-19 with the short-term problems 
they’re going to have; hopefully, we’re going to get 
through these COVID-19 challenges.

And then the question’s going to be what types of 
financial fractures are we still going to have? And 
so that time will be one when these institutions 
that are on the ground in lower-income, minority 
communities are going to be the ones that can help 
rebuild those communities. And so my real strong 
advice is to think about policy in ways that put more 
capital in those institutions.

Author Talks: The collectionMcKinsey Global Publishing Director Raju 
Narisetti chatted with Saadia Madsbjerg, a 
McKinsey alumna and a former managing director of 
the Rockefeller Foundation. In Making Money Moral: 
How a New Wave of Visionaries Is Linking Purpose 
and Profit (Wharton School Press, February 2021), 
Madsbjerg and coauthor Judith Rodin, former 
president of the Rockefeller Foundation, explore 
a burgeoning movement of innovators who are 
unlocking private-sector investments in new ways 
to solve global problems, from environmental 
challenges to social issues such as poverty and 
inequality. An edited version of their conversation 
follows.

What problem are you trying to solve with  
this book? 
Judy and I wrote the book because over the last 
decade, there have been growing calls for the need 
to reimagine capitalism. And these calls have come 
from the corporate side, from political leaders, 
and from intellectual forces as well. There’s been 
a reckoning that the way we have organized the 
system, while it has lifted millions out of poverty and 
contributed to strong economic growth, has also 
created great inequities in society.

The difference [wealth gap] between the haves and 
the have-nots, for the poorest and the richest, is 
the widest we have seen in a very long time. Now, 
at the heart of this is the problem of how we have 
organized our financial markets and where we 
have invested our money. Since the 1970s, we have 
followed a shareholder primacy mantra, where our 
focus has been on short-term profits.

And we haven’t looked at the environmental impact 
of the way we have run our businesses and the 
way we have made our investments. We now know 
that what we do in business has a strong impact on 
society, and the other way around as well. So the 
argument for rethinking how to invest isn’t an ethical 
one. It really has to do with creating long-term value 
for not only our portfolios, but also for society.

Reimagining capitalism 
There are many that have called for the need 
to reimagine capitalism. And there are many 
commitments that have been made and that are 
being made. We wrote the book because we 
really wanted to bring attention to how that can be 
done. In the book, we make the case for how it’s 
something that cannot be done by the financial 
industry alone. There is a need to partner with 
those that are at the forefront of addressing some 
of these challenges: the NGOs [nongovernmental 
organizations], philanthropy, businesses, and public 
agencies as well. So our aim with the book is to really 
accelerate an interesting and fascinating movement 
that we believe has the capacity and the potential to 
reimagine capitalism.

So money in itself isn’t good or bad. It does what  
we tell it to do. Look at sustainable and impact 
investing, which just a little over a decade ago 
was a very niche market that was based on trust, 
but now has developed into something that deals 
in the trillions. Here in the US, one out of every 
$3 of professionally managed assets is now in 
sustainable strategies. That is a huge shift that  
has happened, and we see it really taking hold, 
across all asset classes, and in all sectors.

What also makes us hopeful, which are going to grow 
way beyond where we are today, are two things. One 
is that for the vast majority of investors that have 
adopted this strategy, it is a values-driven imperative, 
as opposed to a values-driven agenda. So let’s take 
climate action. The people who are realigning their 
investment portfolios and their strategies to really 
address climate change are not doing it because 
they are on a mission to save the planet—they’re 
doing it because it’s the right thing to do for the 
bottom line as well.

The second thing I would point to is that the owners 
of capital, the big pockets of capital, are those that 
have really taken the leadership in bringing this

‘Your voice matters as an investor. Your 
vote matters as an investor. And strategies 
that can allow you to use both of those to 
drive toward a sustainable world is really 
what drives a lot of impact.’

case about. So it’s not a call that’s coming from 
philanthropy or governments, but it’s really from 
those that own that money in that capital. So there 
are a number of things that are happening that 
makes us feel as if “making money moral,” as we  
call it in the book, really is a natural evolution of 
capitalism and the way we invest our money.

Why is avoiding “sin stocks” not a good  
enough strategy? 
One of the main tools of investing responsibly is  
the influence that you have as an owner. Your voice 
matters, your vote matters. Now divestment, which 
is a strategy where you sell or choose not to invest  
in certain businesses or projects because of their 
profiles, is an old and well-established strategy.  
We believe that there is more that can be done if 
investors actively engage in the conversation and 
use that voice and their vote to bring about change. 
And we’ve seen it happen in many cases.

Take the example of State Street. It’s one of the 
largest asset managers that manage more than  
$3 trillion. In recent years, it’s had a strong focus 
on promoting gender diversity on the boards of the 
companies that it invests in. It launched what is called 
the Fearless Girl campaign back in 2017, where it put 
out a call and told the companies that it expected 
them to have at least one female director on their 
board. Fast-forward a few years, and you have 700 
companies that previously did not have any female 
representation on the board now have at least one.

I mean, that’s change that happens when you use 
your voice and you use your vote. So your voice 
matters as an investor. Your vote matters as an 
investor. And strategies that can allow you to use 

both of those to drive toward a sustainable world is 
really what drives a lot of impact.

R for resilience

Why do you advocate for the adaptation of  
ESG [environmental, social, and governance] to 
ESGR [environmental, social, governance, and 
resilience]? 
Impact investing is a term that was coined back  
in 2007 at a conference hosted by the Rockefeller 
Foundation. Since then, it has really taken root  
and grown. There are two things that the pandemic 
really brought to the forefront. One is the 
interconnectedness between the economy,  
climate, natural environment, and human health,  
and if you really look at the implications of that, 
it gives us reason to look at how we have been 
managing and assessing ESG and bring greater  
rigor to those areas, and depth as well.

For example, E, which stands for environmental— 
we expect that it is going to be broadened to look 
at much more than greenhouse-gas emissions and 
really have a focus on biodiversity. S, which is the 
social side of it—we expect that it is going to have  
a greater focus on social inclusion and human  
rights. And when it comes to governance, there’s 
going to be greater focus on how the leadership of 
businesses and programs that the money is  
invested in managed these sustainability  
challenges and opportunities, and how they  
govern their organizations. Those are all things  
that we see as the natural evolution of ESG.

Author Talks: The collectionThe other thing that the pandemic really reminded 
us of is how frequent the shocks and stresses that 
we’ve been facing globally are becoming and how 
prolonged they’re becoming. And that has brought 
attention to the concept of resilience. The idea is 
that companies need to be organized in a way and 
governed in a way in which they have the ability to 
adapt and rebound quickly. And those things are not 
currently set up and measured in the E and the S 
 and the G components. So that’s why we make an 
argument for adding an R—an R for resilience.

What surprised you most about writing this book—
in the research, writing, or response? 
History doesn’t go in a straight line. Sustainable and 
impact investing has gone from being a niche market 
that had a handful of investors to now counting some 
of the biggest asset owners and asset managers as 
its champions, and it happened in a relatively small 
period of time. The big question that came up as we 
were in the middle of writing this book, and as the 
real impact of COVID-19 on the economy and on the 

lives of people was unfolding, was this realization 
of, we’ve finally reached the moment where we’ll be 
able to say what happens with this form of investing 
when we have turmoil in the markets.

How relevant were lessons from your years at 
McKinsey? 
I started off my career at McKinsey straight out of 
business school, and it was an amazing experience. 
It taught me how to think broadly about the world, 
about problems. It taught me to go in with an open 
mind and learn along the way, and really push the 
boundaries of what the possibilities can be. And 
while I wasn’t working on anything that touched the 
social sector back in those days, that way of thinking, 
and that way of approaching the world, is really 
something that I have held dear since, and have 
continued to use, during the years that I was at the 
Rockefeller Foundation and for doing the research 
and the writing of the book, too.
