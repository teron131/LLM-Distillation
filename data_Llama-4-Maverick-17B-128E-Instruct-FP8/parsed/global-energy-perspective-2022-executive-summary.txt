Global Energy Perspective 2022

Editor's note

April 2022

We publish this long-term energy outlook at a time when global energy markets are 
facing unprecedented uncertainty. The global energy landscape has been impacted by 
increased market uncertainty due to the conflict in Ukraine. Already before the conflict 
began, the rebound in energy demand triggered supply constraints and price spikes for 
multiple commodities. Additionally, the long-term shift to low-carbon energy systems 
continues to gain momentum and has been accelerating in several respects. 

We choose to publish this report now to contribute a set of scenarios that may help 
calibrate the invasion of Ukraine with the longer-term energy transition momentum. 
The conflict is having immediate impacts on energy markets around the world. The 
resulting uncertainty is something that the world has not seen in a long while and, as 
of today, the potential scenarios that could unfold remain very uncertain. As a firm, we 
have been exploring overall scenarios on how the situation might evolve and what the 
implications on the energy markets could be. As we continue to monitor the situation, 
we will provide regular updates on where the energy market could be headed as 
stakeholders try to balance affordability, energy security, and long-term decarbonization 
ambitions. At the same time, most of the developments may be pertinent to the longer-
term trends in energy systems that we have observed in the past decade, like increased 
competitiveness of electrification and renewables. This report specifically focuses 
on those longer-term trends and is based on the insights and analytics developed 
by McKinsey’s Energy Insights as well as the expertise of our industry and regional 
practitioners.   

Looking back to 2021, the economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic brought a rebound in energy demand around the globe. This, coupled with 
supply side constraints, caused energy prices to see notable increases, especially 
for natural gas and electricity. While gas prices hit a 30-year low at the start of the 
pandemic, they reached a nearly two-decade-high point in 2021. Power prices showed 
similar volatility, impacting energy costs for many businesses and households. 

At the same time, the transition to a low-carbon economy is continuing. In the 
context of COP26, a large number of countries, as well as many of the world’s largest 
corporations, have committed to achieving net zero emissions within the next few 

decades. Although most of these pledges have yet to be translated into concrete policies 
and actions, the continued growth of low-carbon technologies shows that key enablers 
for the energy transition keep momentum.

These shifts and their interplay raise several key questions about the potential path 
ahead for the global energy landscape. Will price spikes delay the energy transition, 
or will high fossil fuel prices accelerate adoption of low-carbon alternatives? Will 
governments and businesses further increase their efforts to decarbonize, or will 
challenges in implementation lower ambition levels? How might the invasion of Ukraine 
influence the direction and speed of the transition? And, will there be an orderly 
transition to a low-carbon economy, or will rapid shifts come with instability and unrest?

Our 2022 Global Energy Perspective presents a new suite of five energy scenarios. 
Based on contributions from hundreds of McKinsey expert practitioners from around 
the world, these scenarios cover a spectrum of possible outcomes, ranging from strong 
decarbonization in line with many of the recent net-zero pledges to a scenario that sees 
fading momentum for a transition of the global energy system. We use these scenario 
outlooks—and the underlying models—to support hundreds of leaders around the world 
and across a broad range of sectors, helping organizations navigate the transitions in 
energy systems.  

This report is divided into four parts. Part one provides a perspective on the 
development of fundamental drivers for the global energy system. Part two provides 
an outlook for power systems, and outlooks for each energy type and carrier, including 
hydrogen, sustainable fuels, natural gas, oil, and coal, as well as a view on the role of 
CCUS. Part three discusses carbon emissions, and part four reflects on implications for 
business leaders and policy makers, including a view on value pools and an outlook for 
energy investments.  

We hope that this report provides valuable insight into the energy transition, and that it 
helps inform thinking around the low-carbon future.

While governments and businesses 
are increasingly committed to steep 
decarbonization targets, energy 
markets face extreme volatility 
driven by geopolitical tensions and 
a rebound in energy demand

Going forward, the energy mix is 
projected to shift toward power. 
By 2050, electricity and enabling 
hydrogen and synfuels could 
account for 50% of the energy mix

Electricity demand is projected to 
triple by 2050 as sectors electrify and 
hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels 
increase their market share due to 
decarbonization

Renewable generation is projected to 
reach 80–90% of the global energy 
mix by 2050 as the global build-out 
rates for solar and wind grow by a 
factor of five and eight respectively 

Hydrogen demand in new sectors 
could reach 350–600 mtpa in 2050 
(compared to ~80 mtpa today); global 
demand for sustainable fuels is 
expected to mature, reaching 8–22% 
of all liquid fuels by 2050

The conflict in Ukraine, as well as 
other factors, have triggered sig-
nificant peaks in energy prices as 
uncertainties around supply security 
and affordability are paramount. This 
comes at a time where markets are 
already tight following the COVID-19 
rebound

Throughout 2021, global energy de-
mand and emissions increased by 5% 
compared to 2020, almost reaching 
pre-COVID-19 levels (~33 Gt ener-
gy-related CO₂ equivalent)

In the context of COP26, a total of 
64 countries (accounting for 89% 
of global CO₂ emissions) have made 
net-zero pledges, while financial 
institutions and private sector enter-
prises also continue to increase their 
decarbonization aspirations

1. Between Current Trajectory and Achieved Commitments scenarios

Source: McKinsey Energy Insights Global Energy Perspective 2022

The projected peak in demand 
for fossil fuels continues to move 
forward; demand for oil is projected 
to peak in the next five years

Even if all countries with net-zero 
commitments deliver on their 
aspirations, global warming is 
projected to reach 1.7°C by 2100

Peak oil demand is projected to occur 
between 2024 and 2027¹ driven 
largely by EV uptake—a development 
that is already underway. Coal 
demand peaked in 2013 and, after 
a temporary rebound in 2021, is 
projected to continue its downward 
trajectory

The conflict in Ukraine is leading 
to price spikes as the market and 
consumers balance supply security 
and affordability

All scenarios require substantial 
shifts to occur across the energy 
landscape. Even in the Current 
Trajectory scenario, significant 
investments will likely be required to 
kickstart new technologies

With current government poli-
cies, additional commitments, and 
projected technology trends, global 
warming is projected to exceed 
1.7°C, making a 1.5° pathway increas-
ingly challenging

Toward 2035, gas demand across 
all scenarios is projected to grow 
another 10–20% compared to today¹; 
after 2035, gas demand will likely 
be subject to larger uncertainties, 
driven especially by the interplay with 
hydrogen

To keep the 1.5° Pathway in sight, the 
global energy system may need to 
accelerate its transformation signifi-
cantly, shifting away from fossil fuels 
toward efficiency, electrification, 
and new fuels, quicker than even the 
announced net-zero commitments

Two to four¹ Gt of CO₂  will need 
to be captured by CCUS by 2050 
to decarbonize heavy industries 
where fossil fuels continue to play a 
significant role

Total investments across energy 
sectors are projected to grow by more 
than 4% per annum and are projected 
to be increasingly skewed towards 
non-fossil and decarbonization 
technologies, while returns remain 
uncertain

Annual investments in energy supply 
and production are expected to double 
by 2035 to reach $1.5 trillion to $1.6 
trillion¹; almost all growth is expected 
to come from decarbonization technol-
ogies and power, which will by 2050 
exceed today’s total energy investments

EBIT in decarbonization technologies 
and power is expected to grow by 5% 
per annum, and could outpace the 
growth in underlying investments

Business models in a highly decarbon-
ized system are expected to remain 
uncertain across sectors, and will likely 
rely on adjustments in market design (for 
example, capacity payments for flexible 
thermal power generation), subsidies, or 
other support mechanisms (for example, 
support for CCUS on top of CO₂ prices)

Scenarios center around pace of technological progress and level of policy enforcement

Global energy consumption is projected to flatten 
in the coming decades. Despite rapid growth of 
the global economy and population growth of two 
billion people, energy consumption is projected to 
grow by only 14% 

Continued reductions in the energy intensity of 
GDP are a key driver, triggered by greater end-use 
efficiency in buildings, transport, and industry. 
Electrification plays an important role in this, as a 
shift to electrical solutions tends to come with a 
step-change in efficiency in many segments, such 
as space heating and passenger cars

The role of electricity in the final consumption mix 
is projected to grow from ~20% today to 40% by 
2050. The corresponding doubling of electricity 
consumption combined with uptake of hydrogen is 
projected to offset fossil-fuel consumption (which 
excludes primary demand of coal and gas for 
power generation), which could be ~40% lower in 
2050 compared to 2020

Power supply and demand
Chapter summary

Power consumption is expected 
to triple by 2050 as electrification 
and living standards grow

Renewables are expected to 
become the new baseload, 
accounting for 50% of the power 
mix by 2030 and 85% by 2050

Flexible assets like gas plants, 
batteries, and hydrogen 
electrolyzers are key for grid 
stability and decarbonization

Technologies like CCUS¹ and 
nuclear will likely see additional 
growth if renewables build-out 
remains constrained

Electrification is often the first lever  
projected to achieve the emission-
reduction goals, being the cheapest and 
easiest to implement in most sectors

Transportation is projected to see the 
fastest transition to electricity due to EVs 
reaching cost parity with ICE cars already in 
the mid-2020s

In buildings, increasing living standards are 
projected to drive the increasing demand 
for appliances and space cooling, bringing 
the sector to ~60% electrification in 2050 
from ~30% today

Particularly for the long term, green 
hydrogen production is projected to be the 
biggest driver of additional power demand 
(42% of the growth between 2035–2050), 
with hydrogen playing a key role for hard-
to-abate sectors such as iron and steel

Solar and wind builds already come at a 
lower cost than than existing fossil fuels 
in most countries and are projected to 
become increasingly cost competitive 
globally 

Thermal generation is projected to shift 
to a role of back-up flexibility provider to 
support grid stability, with load factors 
declining ~30% globally from 2019 to 2050 
(from 40% to 28%)

There are expected regional differences 
in the decarbonization paths for the power 
mix, driven by active policies, political 
preferences, economic factors, and the 
availability of land and resources

Global Energy Perspective 2022

The large projected build-out of 
intermittent renewables can pose 
challenges around land use, transmission 
capacity, and overall acceptance

Should roadblocks arise that limit the 
deployment of renewables, low-carbon 
technologies such as CCUS, nuclear, and 
long-duration energy storage (LDES) could 
help meet emission goals

Nuclear uptake could be significant in 
land-constrained regions, while CCUS 
could cover 8—17% of the remaining fossil 
generation by 2050, if growing CO₂ prices 
make it attractive in regions with low-cost 
fuels 

Both traditional and new flexible capacity 
are needed to ensure system security 
(globally, 24 TW capacity additions by 
2050). Flexible capacity additions are 
estimated to account for ~25% of total 
additions between 2030 and 2035, with 
hydrogen, EVs, and batteries making up a 
large share of this capacity

Green hydrogen is projected to account for 
28% of power demand by 2050. Despite 
creating additional demand, dispatchable 
electrolyzers allow for the integration 
of more intermittent renewable energy 
sources in the system, reducing specific 
emissions by ~15%

Green hydrogen is projected to contribute 
as a storage mechanism for power 
production. Gas turbines converted to 
hydrogen can provide additional flexibility.
New technologies, such as vehicle-to-grid 
and long-duration energy storage, could 
play a key role if they reach technological

In all scenarios, renewables are projected 
to lead the power generation mix, reaching 
80 —90% in 2050. In the Further Acceleration 
scenario, RES share is expected to double in the 
next 15 years, from 29% to 60% 

Most of the growth in RES is expected to come 
from solar and onshore wind, due to declining 
costs, and they are projected to make up 43% 
and 26% of generation respectively in 2050 
under the Further Acceleration scenario. Off-
shore wind is projected to remain limited to less 
than 7% of global generation due to permitting 
constraints and policy hurdles, with potential to 
grow further if constraints on onshore wind such 
as land use persist 

Thermal generation is still expected to play 
an important role as a flexibility provider, with 
gas providing substantial shares of base-load 
generation up to 2040 in regions with favorable 
fuel costs 

Nuclear generation is still expected to require 
economic support from policies, which is not yet 
present in many regions as public acceptance 
continues to prove challenging

Oil demand
Chapter summary

A decline in liquids demand in road 
transport will likely drive a peak across 
markets, while growth in chemicals and 
aviation may slow down

Crude oil demand is expected to decline 
rapidly after 2030, while remaining liquids 
demand growth may mostly be seen in non-
energy use of oil and bio- and synfuels

Liquids demand in road transport is projected to decline 
75% by 2050 after peaking in the early 2020s, driven 
by slowing growth in the number of cars on the road, 
increased efficiency, and accelerating uptake of electric 
vehicles (EVs), with bio- and synfuels decreasing demand 
for crude oil further

Aviation liquids demand is projected to continue growing, 
but uptake of bio- and synfuels may result in a decrease 
in the demand for fossil kerosene. Indeed, the demand for 
fossil kerosene is projected to peak by the mid-2030s, 
while sustainable aviation fuels may grow to 40% of 
aviation liquids demand by 2050

Chemicals remain one of the few growth avenues for 
liquids demand; demand is projected to grow 50% by 
2050, despite increasing downward pressure from 
demand reduction, recycling, and pyrolysis

Crude oil used for combustion is expected to decline from 
80%-45% of total liquids by 2050, as growth in non-
energy use of oil continues and bio- and synfuels increase 
their share, especially in transport applications 

Shifts across sectors—such as faster EV uptake, increased 
usage of alternative fuels in aviation and maritime, and 
increased plastic recycling—could accelerate the energy 
transition further. As a result,  crude oil demand could 
fall to 40 MMb/d by 2050 in the Achieved Commitments 
scenario, a 25% decrease from the Further Acceleration 
scenario

Global liquids demand is expected to peak 
around 102 MMb/d in the next two to five 
years, despite a near-term recovery of liquids 
demand from the impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic

COVID-19 resulted in a significant drop in liquids demand; 
while regional demand has largely bounced back, pre-
pandemic levels are projected to be reached only by 2023, 
mainly due to low international aviation traffic

Global liquids demand is projected to peak in the next 
two to five years, driven primarily by electrification and 
efficiencies across sectors

Liquids demand in 2050 could be 35—50% lower than 
today’s levels; however, reaching the target set by the 1.5° 
Pathway would require an even steeper decline in liquids 
demand

On a regional level, liquids demand in major oil markets, 
such as the US and EU, has already peaked, and all 
markets, including developing regions such as India and 
Southeast Asia, are likely to peak before 2040

The uptake of electric vehicles is the main driver for stagnating growth in oil demand

Liquids demand is projected to peak within this 
decade. The primary driver for the reduction in 
growth is a slow-down in demand growth for road 
transport

Historically, oil demand was growing by 1—2 
MMb/d, half of which was through growth in road 
transport. While oil demand continues to recover 
post-COVID-19 in 2022 and 2023, the trends are 
projected to change from 2024 onwards

The primary driver for reduced oil demand for road 
transport is the continued uptake of EVs:
•  Global EV sales grew 62% per annum on 
average in the last four years and by 96% 
in 2021 alone. EV sales in absolute terms 
increased from 2.3 million in 2019 to 6.6 million 
in 2021
EV sales in Europe accounted for more than 
20% of total car sales in 2021; US EV sales only 
accounted for 5%, but doubled year on year

• 

Alongside this, the use of oil in power and heat is 
decreasing. In the buildings sector, a ban on new 
domestic oil heaters continues the decline in line 
with historical trends

Natural gas demand
Chapter summary

Gas has gradually increased its 
share in the energy mix and 
is expected to play a key role 
throughout the transition with its 
wide range of applications 

The global gas price rally in 2021 was 
supported by high gas demand due to 
rapid economic recovery and unexpected 
weather conditions, and a lower supply 
due to unexpected outages and 
underinvestment

Uncertainty around the pace and shape 
of the energy transition may impact the 
volatility in gas prices and lead to even more 
pronounced investment cycles

Going forward, gas could play a new role in 
blue hydrogen and ammonia production, 
and gas infrastructure could be repurposed 
for low-carbon fuels such as hydrogen and 
biogas, or CO₂ transportation for CCUS

Gas demand is projected to 
grow by 10% in the next decade 
in all scenarios. After 2030, 
gas projections diverge across 
scenarios driven by increasing 
decarbonization pressure in 
buildings and industry

The demand for gas is projected to be more 
resilient than for other fossil fuels. Its share 
in primary energy demand is expected to 
decline from 23% today to 23—15%  
by 2050

In the Achieved Commitments scenario, the 
remaining gas demand in 2050 is due to 
countries without net-zero commitments, 
carbon offsets, or the deployment of CCUS, 
which explains 54%, 15%, and 31% of gas 
demand respectively

Relatively robust absolute gas demand 
translates into a reducing role of gas in 
providing heat and power due to high 
growth of low-carbon alternatives in these 
sectors

Global Energy Perspective 2022

Gas demand is projected to peak 
by 2035. Demand growth in 
power and industry, particularly 
in Asia, may eventually be offset 
by decline, especially in buildings 

The regional shift of gas demand 
to Asia is expected to continue, 
as China’s role of demand-growth 
engine is taken over by Southeast 
Asia after 2030

Gas demand in power is set to grow strongly 
until between 2035 and 2040, after which 
it is projected increasingly to play the role of 
back-up to renewables

China’s gas consumption is likely to be 
supported by coal-to-gas switching and the 
role of CCUS in power and industry

Almost all additional demand for imported 
gas is supplied by LNG , which is projected 
to lead to a growth of 20–70% in 2050 
compared to 2019, depending on the 
scenario

Long-term gas demand is likely to 
be supported by industry (for high-
temperature heat and chemicals), 
particularly in Asia

Gas demand in buildings is expected 
to decline after 2025. The decline will 
likely be driven by increased insulation, 
electrification, and usage of green gases 
such as hydrogen or biomethane

Scenarios diverge after 2030, driven by increasing decarbonization pressure in buildings

Respondents who agree the activity is done frequently in their organisation, % responses

In the Further Acceleration scenario, gas 
demand is projected to grow until 2035. 
The decline thereafter is driven primarily 
by government policies to decarbonize the 
industrial and buildings sectors. Alternative 
fuels in buildings and industry may need strong 
policy support to become viable

In the Current Trajectory scenario, gas demand 
is projected to increase by 16% from today 
before it reaches a peak in 2040

In the Achieved Commitments scenario, the 
decline is expected to start in 2030, driven 
by decarbonization targets in buildings and 
industry

However, even progressive scenarios are far 
from achieving the 1.5º Pathway, in which gas 
consumption must decline substantially before 
2030

Overall, the decline in gas demand post 2030 
is driven by electrification, strong renewables 
uptake, and green hydrogen adoption in the 
power, buildings, and industrial sectors

Hydrogen demand
Chapter summary

Hydrogen demand is projected 
to grow fivefold by 2050, driven 
primarily by road transport, 
maritime, and aviation

Growth to 2035 is driven by sectors with 
favorable economics versus alternatives, 
such as road transport where fuel cell 
electric vehicles (FCEVs) will likely displace 
conventional diesel trucks

Beyond 2035, private and public sector 
commitments could drive the adoption 
of hydrogen in sectors with unfavorable 
economics, such as the aviation and 
maritime sectors, which are likely to adopt 
hydrogen-derivative fuels like synthetic 
kerosene and ammonia

This growth is not without precedent; 
historical natural gas adoption in the 
European Union (EU) indicates it is possible 
to rapidly change the energy system

Hydrogen supply is projected 
to shift from nearly 100% 
grey hydrogen to 60% clean 
production by 2035, as costs 
decline and policymakers support 
hydrogen technology adoption

In the Further Acceleration scenario, clean 
hydrogen supply totals around ~110 Mt 
(~60% of total supply) by 2035 and ~510 Mt 
(~95%) by 2050. Some regions are projected 
to fully phase out grey hydrogen (from fossil 
fuels) by 2050, such as the EU and the UK

Announcements of new clean hydrogen 
production projects tripled year on year 
in 2021. Around 22 Mt of clean hydrogen 
capacity has been announced to date, 
approximately 15–20% of what is needed by 
2035

Hydrogen production will likely be a major 
driver of energy demand growth. By 2050, 
hydrogen is projected to add approximately 
18,000 TWh of electricity consumption 
(~36% of electric demand growth) and 
around 300 bcm to natural gas demand

Three fundamental enablers 
may be needed to support the 
development of the hydrogen 
economy

Infrastructure and supply chain: Timely 
deployment of infrastructure across the 
whole supply chain is likely required to meet 
hydrogen demand. Transport and storage 
infrastructure may be key to enabling a 
global hydrogen value chain

Technology advancement and 
manufacturing scale-up: Cost reduction 
and increased scale-up in renewable 
energy production, electrolyzers, and 
carbon capture, utilization,  and storage 
will likely be needed to make clean 
technologies cost competitive against 
conventional high-carbon production 
routes 

Government support: Government support 
and targeted actions, such as an increase 
in CO₂ prices, could be key. Such moves 
are particularly needed in segments where 
hydrogen will not be cost competitive 
compared to the high-carbon alternative, 
such as the aviation sector. Around 40 
countries already have dedicated hydrogen 
strategies in place

New trade flows could emerge 
to connect demand centers with 
resource-rich regions

Regions with cost-optimal production 
resources, such as natural gas or renewable 
energy, could become major hydrogen 
export hubs and be at the forefront of a new 
global hydrogen trade

Hydrogen imports would enable the 
uptake of hydrogen in countries that 
have decarbonization ambitions, but lack 
resources such as renewable energy, 
natural gas, and carbon dioxide storage 
(such as Japan, South Korea, and parts of 
Europe)

Converting hydrogen to synfuels (a liquid 
fuel mixture containing hydrogen, such as 
ammonia or methanol) at the export hub 
could expedite international hydrogen 
shipping

3.  Other includes buildings and electricity generation

Source: McKinsey Energy Insights Global Energy Perspective 2022

In the Further Acceleration scenario, before 
2035, 29 Mt (30%) of hydrogen demand 
growth is projected to come from new industrial 
uses such as iron and steel, driven by early 
decarbonization targets and by new-built 
plants. Another 26 Mt (30%) comes from 
road transport, driven by the increasing cost 
competitiveness of hydrogen vehicles

Hydrogen demand is projected to accelerate 
after 2035 across all sectors, with road 
transport and new industrial uses still 
accounting for more than 50% of demand 
growth

Demand for synfuels production, mainly 
kerosene, diesel, and ammonia for aviation and 
maritime sectors, is also projected to accelerate 
after 2035, resulting in a total of 93 Mt in 2050, 
equivalent to ~17% of total H2 demand

Refining is the only sector where demand is 
projected to decline post 2030. As hydrogen is 
involved in the hydrotreating processes of oils 
in refineries, the shift from oil to cleaner fuels 
for transport (including direct hydrogen use in 
aviation and maritime, synfuels, BEV, and FCEV) 
consequently decreases demand for hydrogen

Sustainable Fuels
Chapter summary

Sustainable fuels are 
needed to meet 2030 
decarbonization targets

New regulations, such as Fit for 
55 in the EU, will likely drive the 
demand for sustainable fuels

Even in a world with fast EV 
uptake—where EVs account 
for ~75% of total vehicle sales  
by 2030—reaching regulatory 
GHG reduction targets for 
transportation could require 
a  significant contribution from 
sustainable fuels

Sustainable fuels can 
provide GHG reductions 
comparable to BEVs and 
are applicable in multiple 
sectors

Sustainable fuels include biofuels 
such as hydrotreated vegetable 
oil (HVO) or bioethanol, and 
synthetic fuels (synfuels) such 
as ammonia or methanol. They 
can be used as drop-in fuels in 
conventional internal combustion 
engines (ICE)

Even though the costs of using 
sustainable fuels are projected 
to be higher than alternatives 
in the long term, the use of 
100% renewable diesel, such as 
HVO, can achieve comparable 
lifecycle greenhouse-gas (GHG) 
reduction to the use of electric 
vehicles (EVs), allowing for faster 
decarbonization of existing fleets 
in the short term

Global Energy Perspective 2022

The demand for 
sustainable fuels is 
projected to triple over 
the next 20 years

Limited availability of 
certain bio-feedstocks 
calls for the uptake of 
other advanced options

In the late 2020s, waste oil 
feedstock (EU REDII Annex IX 
Part A and B) is projected to 
reach global supply caps at ~30 
Mt in the Further Acceleration 
scenario

Meeting the growing demand for 
sustainable fuels beyond 2030 
is expected to require greater 
use of other types of feedstocks, 
including RFNBO (CO₂ and H2)¹ 
and lignocellulosic materials 
that  require novel production 
pathways 

Growth in sustainable fuels 
until 2035 is driven primarily by 
road transport, reaching 290 
Mt in the Further Acceleration 
scenario, while aviation plays 
an increasingly important role 
thereafter

Post 2035, increasing BEV 
penetration is expected to 
cause a decline in ICE vehicles 
and a corresponding decline of 
sustainable fuels used in road 
transport. However, increasing 
sustainable aviation-fuels 
demand driven by mandates is 
projected to more than offset the 
decline, resulting in a net total 
demand of almost 400 Mt by 
2050

Investments in 
sustainable fuels are 
gaining momentum— 
$40 billion to $50 billion 
of investment expected by 
2025

With ~70% of investments 
already after a Financial 
Investment Decision (FID), 49 Mt 
of sustainable-fuels capacity is 
projected by 2025

However, further investments of 
between $1 trillion and $1.4 trillion 
are needed by 2040 to meet 
decarbonization commitments 
and regulated demand

In the coming decades, business 
cases may need to consider 
integrated production logic with 
volumes shifting from road to 
aviation, where profitability of 
production is projected to depend 
on supply-demand balance, 
feedstock availability, and 
consumer attractiveness

Indirect land use change

Sustainable fuel demand is projected to 
increase rapidly in the 2020–30s, driven 
primarily by demand growth in the road 
transport market

After 2035, however, the projected 
increase in EV penetration of the transport 
market may cause a decline in the use of 
ICE  vehicles and a corresponding decline 
of liquid fuels, and thus sustainable fuels, 
in road transport. On the other hand, 
increasing mandates in aviation could 
outweigh the decline, resulting in further 
growth of the total demand for sustainable 
fuels, reaching almost 400 Mt by 2050 in 
the Further Acceleration scenario

However, since the availability of waste 
oil feedstocks is highly constrained, the 
global supply cap (30 Mt) is projected 
to be reached in the late 2020s, unless 
purposely-grown volumes of low ILUC⁶/
cover crops are rapidly scaled. Indeed, 
meeting the growing demand for 
sustainable fuels will require significant 
growth in the use of other feedstocks 
beyond oils and sugars, including RFNBO

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) 
Chapter summary

CCUS is niche today but is projected to 
scale notably, reaching ~2—4 Gt by 2050. 
This will likely require a significant 
acceleration compared to the current 
pipeline

To meet announced net-zero commitments in the 
Achieved Commitments scenario, CCUS uptake 
will need to grow 120 times by 2050, reaching ~4.2 
Gt and decarbonizing 45% of remaining emissions 
in the industry sector. It could act as an important 
decarbonization lever for hard-to-abate sectors and as a 
kick-starter for blue hydrogen

In the Further Acceleration scenario, hard-to-abate 
sectors in countries without net-zero commitments are 
projected to decarbonize to a lesser extent, only scaling 
up when economically viable and reaching ~3.6 Gt by 
2050

In the Current Trajectory scenario, CCUS demand would 
reach ~2.1 Gt by 2050, assuming the scale up is mainly in 
line with today’s pipeline

However, CCUS uptake is subject to uncertainty, 
mostly driven by a lack of clarity on commercially-
viable business models of CCUS relative to alternative 
decarbonization levers, as well as on the regulatory 
development

Global Energy Perspective 2022

By 2050, ~80% of CCUS uptake is 
projected to be deployed in cement, 
iron and steel, and H₂ production, yet is 
expected to be subject to sector-specific 
uncertainties and to show regional 
differentiation

Among the industrial segments, the highest CCUS 
uptake is projected for the blue hydrogen production, 
iron and steel, and cement sectors (together 
accounting for 85% of global total in the Further 
Acceleration scenario)

CCUS could play a larger role in the decarbonization 
of the power sector and may reach 1—2 Gt by 2050 if 
renewable energy sources (RES) build-out is limited 
by increased land costs in the US, and if India and 
China choose to avoid stranding young coal and gas 
plants

The role of CCUS in reducing emissions varies by 
industry segment. It is the only scalable solution 
for cement to reduce process emissions, but is 
facing strong competition from alternatives in other 
segments

CCUS uptake differs per region, mainly depending 
on decarbonization ambitions, the economics of 
blue hydrogen, and the availability of alternative 
decarbonization levers for hard-to-abate sectors

CO₂ revenue schemes are uncertain, as 
projected CO₂ prices of up to $150–$205/
ton are likely insufficient to accelerate 
CCUS uptake towards a net-zero 
trajectory

The costs and economic viability of CCUS applications 
vary widely depending on segment and geography

There is large uncertainty on the revenue streams 
for CCUS, given that the projected carbon dioxide 
prices are insufficient to scale up CCUS on their 
own, especially for low-purity point sources where 
additional revenues may be required

Additional revenues are projected to account for 
~15% of total revenues required to make business 
cases toward 2050. These could be from market 
and regulatory incentives (such as voluntary 
carbon markets, government subsidies), consumer 
willingness to pay, and CO₂ end use (such as 
enhanced oil recovery) 

Especially in early years, large additional revenue is 
required to kick-start CCUS, given that less than one-
third of CCUS is expected to be in the money without 
additional revenue streams

Cost-intensive segments, such as cement, and 
iron and steel, are projected to take the majority of 
additional revenues

Includes bio and synthetic liquids and gases in road transport, rail, maritime, and aviation (not including hydrogen)

The growth in sustainable fuels is driven by 
the decarbonization ambition in much of the 
latest regulation, recent investments, and 
technological advancement. This is expected 
to include both different types of biofuels as 
well as power-to-gas fuels. By 2050, the share 
of sustainable fuels in the energy demand for 
transportation could be between 6% and 37%, 
depending on net-zero ambition levels across 
countries

Similarly, this momentum is helping the uptake 
of hydrogen. In the Further Acceleration 
scenario, demand is projected to be mainly in 
the iron and steel, road transport, and buildings 
sectors. In maritime and aviation, hydrogen 
is also projected to be required as input for 
synfuels

In the Further Acceleration scenario, CCUS 
uptake will need to increase 100 times by 2050, 
decarbonizing ~40% of remaining emissions 
in the industry sector. CCUS is an important 
decarbonization lever for hard-to-abate 
sectors, such as iron and steel and cement, and 
may also be necessary as a kick-starter for blue 
hydrogen

Investments and Value Pools
Chapter summary

Energy investments may need to grow 
4% per annum to support the energy 
transition, with new technologies 
capturing ~65% of the investments to 2035

Nascent technologies and renewables 
are likely to consolidate their role and 
experience a quadrupling in EBIT growth 
by 2050

Starting from a relatively low EBIT base of ~$300 billion 
today, power and decarbonization technologies are 
projected to grow at 5% per annum and reach around $1 
trillion in 2050

Profitability is projected to become a challenge for 
conventional power, as its role shifts from base load to 
back-up generation, with global EBIT turning negative 
after 2040 in the Further Acceleration scenario

The exceptionally high returns that characterized oil and 
gas investments in past decades are unlikely to reoccur, 
as the demand outlook weakens and the cost of supply 
increases. Projected EBIT for new technologies, such 
as clean hydrogen, EV charging, CCUS, and sustainable 
fuels in 2050 is expected to surpass the 2021 total 
energy sector EBIT

A substantial growth of energy-related investments is 
triggered by rapid increases in energy demand, with 
demand for power expected to triple and hydrogen 
expected to grow fivefold by 2050 in the Further 
Acceleration scenario, combined with more stringent 
emission-reduction goals

Renewables are projected to account for more 
than 30% of the global investments in the next 
15 years (excluding transmission and distribution 
reinforcements). This is twice as high as projected 
investments in conventional power generation, and 
almost on par with oil and gas investments

Regional dynamics are projected to persist, with 70% 
of the oil and gas investments concentrated in North 
America, Middle East, and Africa to 2035. Europe and 
Greater China are expected to have a larger spend 
on decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen 
electrolyzers and CCUS

Business models in a decarbonized system 
remain uncertain, and will likely be 
affected by regulations' adjustments

Whereas a strong uptake is projected in 
decarbonization energy technologies, triggered by 
cost reductions and rising decarbonization ambitions, 
revenue streams and support schemes to incentivize 
these low-carbon investments remain uncertain

To enable a successful transition, regulations mandating 
a higher share of renewables, CCUS, or sustainable 
fuels could address the current uncertainties in the 
business cases of these new propositions, and should 
stimulate a rapid growth in investments in the short term

Technologies such as firm thermal power generation are 
likely to remain in the mix to provide system stability but 
could see increasing shares of uncertain revenues for 
which new compensation mechanisms may need to be 
specified

Emissions
Chapter summary

Global emissions are headed toward 1.7°C 
to 2.4°C warming, depending on the 
scenario

Emissions in 2021 rebounded to historic 
trends alongside the global economic 
recovery

Meanwhile, 2021 brought a new focus 
on net-zero commitments and methane-
emission reductions

Following a significant decline in 2020, emissions 
showed a strong rebound in 2021, almost returning 
to 2019 levels; emissions in 2021 were only 1% lower 
than 2019 levels. This illustrates how pre-pandemic 
trajectories in emissions have largely continued

Emerging economies drove the rebound in emissions. 
China’s emissions grew at twice its pre-pandemic 
growth rate (3% per annum in 2021) and India 
rebounded to 2019 levels in 2021

Both coal and natural gas emissions were higher than 
2019 levels. The use of coal in power primarily drove 
the surge in coal emissions, supported by strong 
industrial growth in China and high gas prices globally. 
Gas emissions only marginally declined in 2020 and 
increased beyond 2019 levels in 2021

Oil emissions only partially rebounded in 2021, largely 
due to the slow recovery in aviation

Many countries updated their decarbonization plans 
in 2021 to have more aggressive reduction targets. 
Around 91% of global CO₂ emissions are now covered 
by net-zero targets 

In late 2021, as a precursor to COP26, some of the 
world’s largest emitters recognized the GHG methane 
(CH4) as a prominent contributor to global warming. 
They committed to a 30–50% reduction in methane 
emissions by 2030

Although these pledges would reduce global methane 
emissions by around 13% by 2030, they remain 
far from the 34% that is required to achieve a 1.5° 
pathway. Some large emitters, such as Russia, India, 
and China have not yet made commitments to reduce 
emissions

Strong innovation may be necessary to further 
develop technologies to reduce methane emissions 
and reach a 1.5° pathway. Such technologies, 
alongside existing technical levers, will likely be 
crucial to reduce methane emissions

Across scenarios, global energy-related emissions are 
projected to peak before 2030. By 2050, projected 
levels are expected to be 30–70% below emissions 
in 2019. In the Achieved Commitments scenario, 
for example, global energy-related emissions are 
expected to peak around 2023 and decline by 69% to 
11 Gt CO₂ by 2050

However, even though projected emissions reductions 
have accelerated compared to earlier outlooks, the 
world remains far from achieving the 1.5° Pathway, 
even if all countries fulfill their pledges, as in the 
Achieved Commitments scenario, global warming will 
likely still exceed 1.5°C

To meet the requirements for a 1.5° pathway, mature 
economies would likely need to accelerate their 
annual emissions' decline, on average, by a factor 
of eight to nine times compared to efforts in the last 
ten years.  Emissions from emerging economies are 
projected to continue to grow over the next decade; 
these countries may need to move to lower-carbon 
growth paths sooner and reach their emissions peaks 
earlier

COVID-19 triggered a drop in global CO₂ 
emissions of around 5%. However, emissions 
have already rebounded and are back to a 
pre-COVID-19 level. In the Further Acceleration 
scenario, a flattening of energy-related CO₂ 
emissions is projected, with a peak in 2023, 
followed by an accelerating decline

In the Achieved Commitments scenario, 
expected emissions in 2050 are 30% lower 
than in Further Acceleration, reflecting a more 
rapid shift to renewable sources for power 
generation as well as an accelerated uptake 
of new, lower-carbon  technologies in end-use 
segments, such as road transport and industry

However, emissions across all scenarios remain 
far from the requirements for the 1.5º Pathway. 
Depending on the scenario, the median of 
expected global temperature increases could 
reach 1.7—2.4ºC or more by 2100. This median 
global increase implies a 50% chance of 
exceeding the average on a global level, with 
stronger increases for specific regions
