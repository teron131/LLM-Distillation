About the McKinsey 
Global Institute 

The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact 
base to aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s 
companies and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, 
and functional knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are solely 
the responsibility of MGI directors and partners. 

Our research is grouped into five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity: Creating and harnessing the world’s assets most productively 

 — Resources of the world: Building, powering, and feeding the world sustainably 

 — Human potential: Maximizing and achieving the potential of human talent 

 — Global connections: Exploring how flows of goods, services, people, capital, and ideas 

shape economies 

 — Technologies and markets of the future: Discussing the next big arenas of value and 

competition 

We aim for independent and fact-based research. None of our work is commissioned or paid 
for by any business, government, or other institution; we share our results publicly free of 
charge; and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While we engage multiple 
distinguished external advisers to contribute to our work, the analyses presented in our 
publications are MGI’s alone, and any errors are our own.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondAt a glance

Amid tightening labor markets and a slowdown in productivity growth, Europe and the 
United States face shifts in labor demand, spurred by AI and automation. Our updated 
modeling of the future of work finds that demand for workers in STEM-related, healthcare, 
and other high-skill professions would rise while demand for occupations such as office 
workers, production workers, and customer service representatives would decline. By 
2030, in a midpoint adoption scenario, up to 30 percent of current hours worked could be 
automated, accelerated by generative AI. Efforts to achieve net-zero emissions, an aging 
workforce, and growth in e-commerce as well as infrastructure and technology spending and 
overall economic growth could also shift employment demand.

By 2030, Europe could require up to 12 million occupational transitions, double the 
prepandemic pace. In the United States, required transitions could reach almost 12 million, 
in line with the prepandemic norm. Both regions navigated even higher levels of labor market 
shifts at the height of the COVID-19 period, suggesting that they can handle this scale of 
future job transitions. The pace of occupational change is broadly similar among countries in 
Europe, although the specific mix reflects their economic variations. 

Businesses will need a major skills upgrade. Demand for technological and social and 
emotional skills could rise as demand for physical and manual and higher cognitive skills 
stabilizes. Surveyed executives in Europe and the United States expressed a need not just 
for advanced IT and data analytics but also for critical thinking, creativity, and teaching and 
training—skills they report as currently being in short supply. Companies plan to focus on 
retraining workers, in addition to hiring or subcontracting, to meet skill needs.

Workers with lower wages face challenges of redeployment as demand reweights 
toward occupations with higher wages in both Europe and the United States. 
Occupations with lower wages are likely to see reductions in demand, and workers will need 
to acquire new skills to transition to better-paying work. If that doesn’t happen, there is a risk 
of a more polarized labor market, with more higher-wage jobs than workers and too many 
workers for existing lower-wage jobs.

Choices made today could revive productivity growth while creating better societal 
outcomes. Embracing the path of accelerated technology adoption with proactive worker 
redeployment could help Europe achieve an annual productivity growth rate of up to 
3 percent through 2030. However, slow adoption and slow redeployment would limit that to 
0.3 percent, closer to today’s level of productivity growth in Western Europe. Slow worker 
redeployment would leave millions unable to participate productively in the future of work.

Context: Labor shortages 
and a slowdown in 
productivity growth

This report focuses on labor markets in Europe and the United States, looking at the 
next few years to 2030. Technology and other factors will spur changes in the pattern of 
labor demand, but these expected shifts need to be taken in the context of deep-seated 
labor market changes already under way. Our study focuses on nine major economies in the 
European Union along with the United Kingdom (which we refer to collectively in this report as 
“Europe”), in comparison with the United States.

Structural shifts in labor markets have been ongoing for decades, including the very long-
term decline in the share of employment in agriculture, industry, and mining in favor of 
services (Exhibit 1). More recently, labor markets were buffeted by pandemic shocks that 
propelled not only faster shifts in hiring needs and more job switching but also new employee 
preferences such as hybrid work. While COVID-19 exacerbated labor market tightening, 
Europe’s high employment rate, a rapidly aging population, and a steady fall in working 
hours make continuing shortages of workers and skills a persistent challenge for the future. 
The burning question that remains is this: to what extent can the forthcoming technological 
disruption solve labor market challenges in Europe?

and a slowdown in productivity growth

In both Europe and the United States, labor market tightness has been on the rise, with 
unfilled positions on the rise in both regions and unemployment at historically low levels.1 As 
populations age on both sides of the Atlantic and the number of hours worked per worker 
falls, particularly in Europe, labor market tightness is not likely to resolve naturally. In this 
context, employers are increasingly competing for talent. 

The pandemic had additional lasting impacts on workplaces, notably the increased adoption 
of hybrid work. While about 90 percent of the working population was working fully on-site 
in 2018, that number dropped to some 60 percent between 2021 and 2022. Since then, 
the number has stabilized. However, only 40 percent of the 72 minutes saved daily from 
not having to commute is allocated to work, with the rest mostly allocated to leisure and 
caregiving.2 The overall impact on productivity is still being debated.3

Overall, in the global economy, productivity is crucial for remaining competitive.4 When a 
company becomes more productive, it can produce more or higher-quality goods or services 
with the same amount of resources. This often leads to lower production costs, allowing 
companies to remain competitive or even expand. As a result, they may need to hire more 
workers to meet the increased demand for their products or services. Also, increased 
productivity in one sector can stimulate job growth in related industries; it boosts innovation 
and leads to the creation of new job roles in areas such as research and development, 
engineering, and information technology. Increased productivity would help address labor 
market challenges, enabling employers to produce more even in tight talent markets, driving 
economic growth, and creating better-paying jobs with opportunities to build human capital. 

Yet Europe has experienced a long-term productivity slowdown, with productivity growth 
almost steadily decreasing since the 1960s (Exhibit 2).5 Alongside its divergence in 
productivity growth relative to the United States, Europe’s competitiveness is also waning. 
The issues appear to be systemic rather than cyclical. European companies lag behind US 
peers on multiple key metrics, such as return on invested capital, revenue growth, capital 
expenditure, and R&D. Initial delays in Europe in technology development and adoption 
help explain this gap, as Europe did not benefit from the information communications and 
technology–driven productivity advancements that have occurred in the United States since 
the 1990s. Our previous research indicates that Europe lags behind in eight out of ten key 
cross-sector technologies where “winner takes most” effects are common, widening the gap 
between the two regions.6 The two areas in which European companies still have an edge are 
cleantech and next-gen materials, the research found.

In third quarter 2023, the unemployment rate stood at 6.0 percent in Europe and 3.7 percent in the United States, 
compared with a peak of 11.5 percent in Europe in 1994 and 7.5 percent in the United States in 1992. For detailed data, see

Automation technology has the potential to revive productivity growth, allowing economies 
to solve most of today’s labor market challenges. However, Europe and the United States are 
not on the same trajectory for capturing this productivity growth: most AI-related innovations 
are developed in the United States. There are fears in both regions that the adoption of 
these technologies could prove disruptive to labor markets and exacerbate the challenges 
of both finding requisite skills in the workforce and enabling workers to move from declining 
occupations into rising ones. 

Workers navigated major changes in demand for work during COVID-19, which resulted in a 
temporary surge in occupational transitions—a sign that labor markets could successfully 
adjust to rapid and heightened shifts in the pattern of employment demand. In Europe, some 
3 percent of the working population voluntarily or involuntarily exited their occupational 
categories between 2019 and 2022, more than triple the historical average. In the 
period between 2019 to 2022, 5.5 percent of the US working population was affected by 
occupational shifts, 1.5 times the historical average.7 The occupational shifts in both Europe 
and the United States have subsequently returned to their historical rate, although some 
professions continue to be affected, including food service.

Potential for accelerated 
work transitions ahead 

Demand for labor will continue to evolve over time, affected by structural trends at play in 
Europe and the United States. Foremost among these is the expected advancements in 
technology, especially AI, which could accelerate productivity growth and alter labor demand. 
Structural factors such as the aging workforce and rising healthcare needs, particularly 
pronounced in Europe, and additional priorities such as climate change will also reshape 
demand for workers. Additionally, some trends that were boosted by the pandemic are likely 
to endure, including the growth in e-commerce and the switch to remote work. 

These trends represent opportunity for productivity growth but also underscore the need for 
workers to transition from declining occupations to rising ones. In Europe, by our estimates, a 
faster technology adoption scenario could be associated with productivity growth of roughly 
2 to 3 percent per year, requiring some 12 million occupational transitions, or roughly double 
the pace of occupational shifts in the prepandemic period. In the United States, with its 
more dynamic labor market, the trend would be closer to the historical norm, but automation 
adoption could accelerate further after 2030 in both regions. While the scale of occupational 
transitions may appear daunting, both Europe and the United States navigated even higher 
levels of labor market shifts during the pandemic, signaling the potential to handle future 
transitions as well.

In this chapter, we outline how demand for labor could evolve and require accelerated 
occupational transitions in the coming years, considering a range of scenarios to reflect 
the uncertainties around pace of technology adoption (see Box 1, “Our methodology for 
estimating occupational transitions”).

10

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondBox 1 
Our methodology for estimating occupational transitions

We used methodology consistent with other 
McKinsey Global Institute reports on the future 
of work, dating back to 2017, to model trends of 
job changes at the level of occupations, activities, 
and skills.1 For this report, we focused our analysis 
on the 2022–30 period. We also considered how 
automation adoption could evolve beyond 2030 to 
2035.2 The drivers of the model have been updated 
accordingly. 

Our model differentiates between employment 
demand and occupational transitions. For the 
first, it estimates net changes in employment 
demand by sector and occupation; for the second, 
it estimates the net decline in occupations across 
sectors compared with the 2030 baseline. When 
counting transitions, we do not include gains in this 
calculation to avoid double counting.

In this report, we focus our analysis on Europe 
and the United States. For Europe, we included 
ten countries: nine EU members that together 
represent 75 percent of the European working 
population—the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and 
Sweden—and the United Kingdom. In this report, 
numbers referring to “Europe” correspond to the 
total estimates for these ten focus countries, which 
were analyzed individually. Numbers have not 
been extrapolated to the full European working 
population. For the United States, we build on 
estimates published in our 2023 report Generative 
AI and the future of work in America.3

To understand the impact of automation and 
overall potential changes in demand in each 
occupation, we included multiple drivers in our 
modeling: automation adoption, net-zero transition, 
e-commerce growth, remote work adoption, 
increases in income, aging populations, technology 
investments, infrastructure investments, 
marketization of unpaid work, new jobs, and 
increased educational levels. 

A critical driver of occupational transitions is the 
rate at which automation, AI, and generative AI (gen 
AI) will be adopted (exhibit). Two scenarios are used 
to bookend the work-automation model: “late” and 
“early.” The “early” scenario flexes all parameters 
to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting 
in the fastest pace of automation development 
and adoption, and the “late” scenario flexes all 
parameters in the opposite direction. The reality is 
likely to fall somewhere between the two.4

For this report, we have modeled region-specific 
scenarios: 

 — For Europe, we modeled two outcomes: a 

“faster” scenario and a “slower” one. For the 
faster scenario, we use the midpoint—the 
arithmetical average between our late and 
early scenarios. For the slower scenario, we 
use a “mid late” trajectory, an arithmetical 
average between a late adoption scenario 
and the midpoint scenario. We model this 
slower, mid-late scenario for Europe because 
achieving the faster, midpoint scenario by 
2030 would require an occupational transition 
rate significantly higher than seen in Europe’s 
recent prepandemic past. 

 — For the United States, we use the midpoint 

scenario, based on our earlier research. This 
is an arithmetical average between our late 
and early scenarios of automation technology 
adoption. 

We also estimate the productivity effects of 
automation, using GDP per full-time-equivalent 
(FTE) employee as the measure of productivity. We 
first calculated automation displacement under 
different scenarios by multiplying the projected 
number of FTEs by the estimated automation 
adoption rate for each occupation in each country. 
We considered only job activities that are available 
and well defined as of the date of this report. Also, 
to be conservative, we assumed automation has a 
labor substitution effect but no other performance 

1  The modeling examines more than 850 unique occupations, more than 2,000 different activities, and 18 technical capabilities for each 
activity. We also leveraged the framework devised in MGI’s 2018 report Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce. For 
more detail, see the technical appendixes in A future that works: Automation, employment, productivity, McKinsey Global Institute, 
January 2017.

2  For 2035, we modeled only the potential automation adoption rates for each occupation, not the occupational transitions required.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondgains. We assumed that workers displaced 
by automation rejoin the workforce at 2022 
productivity levels, net of automation. 

Our main sources of data are national and regional 
labor surveys. For the United States, we used data 
from the Current Population Survey, conducted by 
the US Census Bureau for the US Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. For Europe, we used data from the 
Labor Force Survey carried out by the European 
Commission and local labor agencies’ data. 
As described in chapter 4, we also conducted 
a survey of more than 1,100 executives in five 
countries.

Our model has some important uncertainties 
and limitations. First, structural attributes—
such as management–employee relations, the 
regulatory and investment framework, and current 
AI and innovation momentum—would affect 

which scenario evolves. Second, labor demand 
could shift based on macroeconomic shifts in 
consumption due to changes in prices and costs, 
which our model does not account for. Indeed, as 
automation increases productivity and income and 
lowers costs and the prices of goods and services, 
it could shift consumption, and thus labor demand, 
in unanticipated ways. In the literature, this 
specific impact of automation has been framed as 
the “deflationist” nature of technology adoption. 
Rapid adoption of technology could therefore 
establish a new equilibrium of demand. Third, the 
shifts we model are the ones broadly anticipated 
given the underlying base and current momentum 
of economies. We do not model changes in 
industrial production, trade, or labor migration that 
may be driven by geopolitical, climatic, or social 
factors, for example.

for a wide range of occupations

Our analysis suggests that demand for some occupations could grow sharply by 2030. In our 
faster, midpoint technology adoption scenario, demand for STEM and health professionals 
would grow by 17 to 30 percent between 2022 and 2030, adding seven million positions in 
Europe and an additional seven million in the United States. Despite the surge in tech sector 
layoffs in 2023 and the potential of generative AI (gen AI) to augment tasks such as coding, 
the broader, long-term demand for tech talent could remain robust across businesses of 
every size and sector in an increasingly digital economy (Exhibit 3). Similarly, demand for 
health aides, technicians, and wellness workers could continue growing by 25 to 30 percent 
between 2022 and 2030, adding 3.3 million positions in Europe and 3.5 million in the 
United States.

By contrast, demand for workers in food services, production work, customer services, 
sales, and office support—all of which declined over the 2012–22 period—could continue to 
decline until 2030.8 These jobs involve a high share of repetitive tasks, data collection, and 
elementary data processing—all activities that automated systems can handle efficiently. In 
all, our analysis suggests that this could lead to decreases in demand for these positions of 
between 300,000 and 5.0 million positions in Europe and 0.1 million to 3.7 million positions in 
the United States. 

Demand for other occupations would remain in line with overall demand growth. This includes 
positions for educators and workforce trainers in Europe and includes businesses and 
legal professionals, as well as community services workers, in the United States. Demand 
for occupations such as management, construction, creative and arts management, and 
transportation services is expected to increase by about 8 to 9 percent.

Our analysis highlights some differences between Europe and the United States in the 
occupations with growing or diminishing demand. Those differences are a result of the 
differences in occupational composition between the two regions, as well as cultural 
specificities. For example, the greater share of public employment in Europe, especially in 
administrative activities, may reduce the impact of the expected disruption on these workers 
for the coming years. Understanding the nuances of how this might play out and who might be 
affected is critical to ensuring a smooth transition for individuals and businesses alike.

in both Europe and the United States by 2030
Our analysis finds that in our faster automation adoption scenario, some 12.0 million 
occupational transitions would be needed by 2030 in the ten European countries, affecting 
6.5 percent of the current employed workforce.9 Under the slower scenario, the number of 
occupational transitions needed would amount to 8.5 million in Europe, affecting 4.6 percent 
of the current employed workforce. In the United States, the figures for the midpoint scenario 
we use (which corresponds to the faster European scenario) are 11.8 million occupational 
shifts, affecting 7.5 percent of the current employed workforce. 

The range of outcomes for Europe from the two scenarios reflects different potential for the 
number of work hours that could be automated, thereby affecting both potential productivity 
gains and the number of occupational transitions that might be needed. A failure to achieve 
the faster-paced adoption model would mean fewer occupational transitions are needed. But 
it would also mean failing to achieve some significant productivity gains in the period to 2030.

Occupational transitions would need to roughly double in Europe 
but return to their historical level in the United States
The pace of change in required occupational transitions is uneven between Europe and the 
United States. Europe could experience a stark acceleration in the pace of occupational 
change needed in both the faster and slower scenarios, with the number rising to between 1.1 
million and 1.5 million occupational transitions annually between 2022 and 2030. That is 1.6 
to 2.2 times the historical 2016–19 rate, before the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating a potential 
doubling of this measure of change in the European employment market. By contrast, in 
the United States, the number of occupational transitions needed annually between 2022 
and 2030 could reach 1.5 million, our analysis suggests (Exhibit 4). This would be slightly 
lower than the historical 2016–19 rate. The difference arises mainly because of the historical 
dynamism of the US employment market, which sees about 1.2 percent of the US workforce 
shifting occupations every year. In comparison, just 0.4 percent of the European workforce 
shifted occupations annually between 2016 and 2019.

The potential pace of yearly occupational changes needed from 2022 to 2030 is lower 
than those experienced by both regions during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019 to 
2022. In Europe and the United States, occupational shifts during the pandemic increased 
significantly, reaching 2.2 million in Europe and 2.9 million in the United States each year, or 
1.2 percent and 1.8 percent of their respective workforces. The changes to labor markets in 
Europe and the United States caused by COVID-19 were both rapid and wrenching, but both 
regions adapted to them, suggesting that they have the potential to respond effectively to 
disruptions brought about by AI, automation, and other drivers of change in labor demand.10

9  Here, “occupational transition” refers to an individual’s move from one occupation to another, as distinct from regular 
employment churn, which includes the movement of individuals between businesses to perform the same occupation.
10  A large share of occupational transitions that occured during COVID-19 were voluntary. This may not be the case with 

future ones.

Note: “Occupational shifts” refers to net declines in employment in specific occupations in 2016–19 and 2019–22. However, we do not know exactly how 
individuals moved from one occupation to another or if they made multiple moves; for that reason, we refer to the number of occupational shifts rather than 
specifying the number of workers making those changes. Transitions are calculated where there is a decline in net demand for an occupation and employees of 
that workforce would have to leave for another occupation. Even in categories that are growing overall, employment may decline in specific occupations, requir-
ing some workers to find new roles. People joining a new occupation are not counted toward transitions, to avoid double counting.

About 30 percent of current work activities could be 
automated by 2030, accelerated by gen AI deployment

The automation of work is the predominant driver of the need for occupational transitions 
by 2030, our analysis finds. Automation and AI technologies have already changed the way 
people work and will continue to do so. More recently, the emergence of gen AI and the rapid 
spread of solutions such as ChatGPT are likely to mark a paradigm shift in the automation of 
work activities, since this technology significantly accelerates the automation potential of 
complex and cognitive tasks once thought to be the sole domain of human judgment.11 

Our analysis finds that, with gen AI, 27 percent of the hours worked in Europe and 30 percent 
of hours worked in the United States today could be automated by 2030, based on a midpoint 
adoption scenario (Exhibit 5).12 By 2035, these figures could rise to 45 percent in Europe and 
48 percent in the United States—reflecting a continuing increase of automation potential in 
the coming decade. (Our model suggests that many hours worked would still be automated 
even without gen AI but fewer than with it: 20 percent in Europe and 21 percent in the 
United States by 2030.)

With gen AI, 27 percent of 
the hours worked in Europe 
and 30 percent of hours 
worked in the United States 
today could be automated by 
2030, based on a midpoint 
adoption scenario. 

11  McKinsey has published extensively on gen AI and its potential uses. See, for example, “The economic potential of 

generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” McKinsey, June 14, 2023.

12  Hours worked refers to hours worked on specific activities in today’s economy. Automation adoption is derived from 
automation potential, which is the theoretical maximum that could be automated, considering current technological 
capabilities. The pace of actual adoption typically lags behind technical potential. It is affected by the time needed for 
solution integration, whether it is economically feasible to replace human labor with technology, and multiple other barriers 
such as customer acceptance, labor laws, and companies lacking the right workforce skills.

With the integration of gen AI, 
STEM professionals in Europe could see automation of the percentage of hours worked more 
than double, from 13 percent to 27 percent. Automation of hours worked for roles in education 
and workforce training could more than triple, from 6 percent without integration of gen AI to 
21 percent with it. 

Gen AI could also extend automation’s influence into areas requiring imagination, creativity, 
and critical judgment. For example, the creative and arts sectors, typically associated with a 
high degree of human originality and innovation, face a possible increase in the proportion of 
hours worked from 9 percent being automated without gen AI to 22 percent with it. Similarly, 
the automation adoption of business and legal professions could rise from 13 percent without 
gen AI to 26 percent with it.

In evaluating the impact of automation technologies, the technical ability of machines is not 
the only factor. Complementarity between the worker and the technology—notably AI—will 
be decisive in propelling adoption. The concept of complementarity, although not the focus of 
our report, is critical for the future of work. As discussed in a recent report by the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF),13 AI complementarity measures the extent to which technologies can 
support workers in their tasks (expanding human labor without replacing it). Complementarity 
varies across different types of occupations, measured through the technicality of applying AI 
as well as social acceptability.

These insights suggest a considerable shift toward embracing gen AI across the board and 
automation of work hours more broadly. However, our analysis also indicates that the effect of 
gen AI on the workforce is not linear and uniform but nuanced and occupation-specific (see 
Box 2, “What could hinder technology adoption including AI?”). 

13  Mauro Cazzaniga et al., Gen-AI: Artificial intelligence and the future of work, IMF, January 2024.

Box 2
What could hinder technology adoption including AI? 

Numerous factors might hinder the 
estimated growth of AI and generative AI 
(gen AI) that underpins our analysis in this 
report. 

On the demand side, the integration of 
automation, AI, and gen AI into existing 
systems could take longer than expected 
if companies struggle to pinpoint effective 
applications or lack relevant workforce 
expertise. Furthermore, the costs 
associated with developing and deploying 
these technologies may escalate if there 
are shortages in computing power or 
energy resources. Another potential 
challenge is the sustainability of wage 
increases due to labor augmentation, 

which could impede further technological 
uptake. Finally, customer acceptance and 
other factors including social, political, 
or regulatory developments that we have 
not explicitly modeled, may need to be 
considered, as AI-fueled automation 
may require behavioral changes in 
some cases—for example, customers 
may need to accept that they will not 
speak to human agents during customer 
support calls. A perception of lacking risk 
management by AI suppliers could also 
hinder customer acceptance.

On the supply side, technological 
advancements may stall, especially if 
adoption rates fall short of expectations 

or if other factors impede technological 
development. For example, physical 
constraints on energy supply could pose 
significant barriers to the rapid increase 
in computing demands: AI and deep 
learning models require substantial 
computational power (approximately 
40 percent of data centers’ electricity 
consumption is dedicated to computing). 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) 
estimates in a high-case scenario that 
the amount of electricity data centers 
consume could more than double from 
2022 to 2026, from 460 terawatt-hours 
to about 1,000.1

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondNet-zero actions, aging demographics, and e-commerce 
will also affect employment demand

Among other trends that will affect labor markets in Europe and the United States in the 
years ahead, we focus here on three: the impact of the push to achieve net-zero emissions, 
changing demographics, and the rise of e-commerce.

Net-zero actions could increase demand for work and lead to 
occupational transitions in both Europe and the United States
Europe and the United States have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 with 
interim targets of reducing emissions 55 percent and 50 percent, respectively, by 2030.14 EU 
countries have also committed to binding principles affecting almost all sectors by 2030 in 
the Fit for 55 package of measures.15 Along with heightened regulation, the European Union 
is emphasizing sustainable spending and aims to mobilize a minimum of €1 trillion in green 
investments by 2030.16 In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has boosted green 
spending, allocating approximately $400 billion toward green initiatives.17 

These regulatory and investment commitments to the net-zero transition could lead to 
structural shifts in the labor market by 2030. To estimate the effect of the net-zero transition, 
we built on previous McKinsey research18 assessing the global impact through 2050 with 
regional deep dives on the European Union and the United States, using the Net Zero 2050 
scenario from NGFS.19

Our analysis suggests that the net-zero transition in Europe could result in 3.0 million gross 
displacements by 2030 through direct and indirect effects across the economy and driven 
by lower demand for jobs in carbon-intensive industries such as oil, gas, and coal. These 
losses could be offset by the potential gross gains of 4.5 million to 5.0 million jobs, primarily 
led by fields such as renewable-power generation and storage, construction, and electric 
vehicles. In the United States, our analysis suggests that the transition could result in gross 
displacement of some 3.5 million positions through direct and indirect effects across the 
economy. But these losses should be more than offset by the gains of 4.2 million jobs. 

Capital spending to build low-emissions facilities and to retrofit existing infrastructure is 
expected to drive much of the demand. In the power sector, in both the European Union and 
the United States, our analysis suggests that about a million new jobs (gross) could be added 
by 2030, boosted mainly by new employment in solar and wind power, with a share of these 
power jobs involving manufacturing and installing new infrastructure. Retrofitting homes and 
commercial buildings with green heating and improved insulation systems could add a gross 
500,000 to one million jobs in the buildings sector in both regions. Some of these shifts are 
already playing out: in the United States, the solar industry employs twice as many workers as 
the coal industry.20

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondSome countries with high concentrations of jobs in affected industries may experience bigger 
shifts. For example, Poland and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe that have 
strong legacies of coal mining and power generation may face higher levels of occupational 
transitions. At the same time, the emergence of new industries such as hydrogen and biofuels 
could create new industrial hubs in areas where sustainable and low-priced electricity will 
be available. For example, Spain could become a competitive producer of green hydrogen, 
leveraging its historical leadership in wind energy (with about 30 gigawatts installed capacity) 
and solar resources.21 

With aging demographics and higher spending, demand for 
healthcare-related services could significantly increase
Developed countries are already demanding more healthcare-related services. This trend is 
expected to continue and accelerate in the coming years. Two drivers behind this acceleration 
are the aging population and surging healthcare spending.

In the ten European countries that are the focus of this report, the elder population—that is, 
people over age 65—almost doubled between 1980 (43 million) and 2022 (82 million). In the 
same period in the United States, the elder population more than doubled, from 24 million to 
57 million. While growth is expected to slow slightly in both regions in coming years compared 
with the past decade, the increase in the elder population will still be significant, amounting 
to 94 million people in the ten European focus countries in 2030 (18 percent of the overall 
population) and 70 million people in the United States (19 percent of the population) in the 
same period.22 This in turn will drive demand for healthcare.

A surge in per capita spending on healthcare will also lift the demand for healthcare services. 
Historically, the United States has spent more on healthcare per capita than Europe and has 
increased its spending at a faster rate. While per capita healthcare spending in the United 
States is higher than in Europe, the acceleration could be steeper in Europe, with spending 
growing at an annual average rate of 6.5 percent between 2022 and 2030, compared with 2.4 
percent annually in the United States, according to our analysis.

E-commerce is among factors that could affect occupational transitions
E-commerce exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it could continue to affect labor 
demand and drive occupational transitions. Its continued growth will likely increase demand 
for logistics and warehousing workers but could decrease demand for in-store occupations. 
Our analysis suggests that this trend could be broadly similar across Europe, with decreases 
in labor demand in traditional retail balanced by a similar scale of increase in e-commerce.

21  “Net-zero Spain: Europe’s decarbonization hub,” McKinsey, September 23, 2022.
22 The elder population would increase by 1.6 percent annually in Europe and by 2.6 percent in the United States between 
2022 and 2030, compared with 1.8 percent in Europe and 3.2 percent in the United States between 2012 and 2022. For 
details, see “Population data,” OECD, accessed May 3, 2024; and “Healthcare spending projections,” IMF, accessed 
May 3, 2024.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyond3

The varied geography of 
labor market disruptions 

The scale of the occupational transitions required is roughly on the same order of 
magnitude across economies, but the specifics vary depending on each region’s economic 
structure—that is, differences in sectoral structure and occupational mix. The impact of 
automation and the other trends we used in our modeling reflect this. Nonetheless, there 
are notable differences in the mix of occupations affected in each country. In this chapter, we 
highlight those differences, with a focus on Europe. 

The scale of occupational transitions required is 
similar across countries, but their mix differs

For Europe, our analysis indicates that the impact of occupational transitions between 2022 
and 2030 will range quite narrowly, from a net 6.0 percent of employment in transition across 
occupations in the United Kingdom to 7.4 percent in Sweden—relatively small differences 
over an eight-year period. Yet a closer look at how labor market trends will affect each country 
reveals some local divergences, notably in the mix of occupations likely to be affected (Exhibit 
6). Such variations are driven by two considerations. First, differences in the structure of 
employment, such as the preponderance of certain sectors, determine the share of the 
workforce in occupations likely to be disrupted. For example, the share of employment 
in occupations with high technical automation potential—those involving more routine 
predictable tasks or more advanced work that gen AI technologies can perform—varies 
across economies. Additionally, some types of work are more susceptible to dislocation due 

22

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondto net-zero actions; countries heavily invested in the oil, gas, and coal sectors, for example, 
could have a higher concentration of occupational transitions. Second, wage levels vary 
among countries.23 Within the same occupation, countries with higher wages could have more 
occupational transitions because higher wages give companies an economic incentive to 
automate.

Office support, production work, and agriculture—all of which would see a decrease in 
labor demand, according to our analysis—exemplify the regional variations in occupational 
transitions ahead.

 — Office support. Occupational transitions required in office support constitute the largest 
share of transitions in all ten European countries we studied. This is particularly true in 
Denmark, Germany, and Italy, where they account for more than 50 percent of the overall 
number of occupational transitions, while in Poland and Sweden they represent only 30 
to 35 percent. Germany and Italy have a relatively high concentration of employment in 
office support work, which is why the share of occupational transitions from these jobs 
would be so high. By contrast, in Sweden, office support accounts for less than 11 percent 
of employment, and thus the share of occupational transitions from this occupational 
category is likely to be lower, based on our analysis. Wages for office support workers are 
higher in Denmark than in, say, Poland, making automation adoption in office work more 
likely in Denmark than in Poland. Consequently, Denmark could experience 50 percent of 
its occupational transitions in office support, due to the strong wage-related incentives to 
automate these jobs, while in Poland, where wages are relatively lower, the share of office 
support in total potential occupational transitions could fall to 30 percent.

 — Production work. Occupational transitions from production work constitute a higher 

share of total transitions in the Czech Republic and Poland (32 percent and 23 percent, 
respectively). In the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, by contrast, this share falls to 9 
percent and 8 percent, respectively. More production work stems from carbon-intensive 
industry in Poland and the Czech Republic than in the Netherlands or the United Kingdom. 
These occupations could face disruptions because of net-zero transitions, driving up the 
share of production work in occupational transitions in these countries. 

 — Agriculture. Poland would experience the most impact in agriculture, with more than 

11 percent of its 2030 potential occupational transitions coming from farming. In other 
European countries, the share of agriculture in occupational transitions would be much 
lower, ranging from 4 percent in Spain to less than 1 percent in the United Kingdom. 
Poland is particularly susceptible to occupational transitions in agriculture because 
the agricultural occupation category represents 6 percent of total employment, two to 
three times higher than in other countries. The share held by agriculture in the expected 
occupational transitions in Poland is thus three to ten times higher than in other countries. 
This is exacerbated by the fact that agriculture in Poland is not yet highly automated today.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondBeyond current employment structure and wage rates, research indicates that AI readiness 
will be needed to unlock AI potential and can explain some local divergences in labor market 
outcomes across countries. “AI readiness” refers to a country’s ability to adopt and deploy 
AI technologies across the private and public sectors. The IMF, for example, groups factors 
influencing AI readiness into four categories: digital infrastructure, innovation and economic 
integration, human capital and labor market policies, and regulation.24 These elements vary 
across the ten European countries that are the focus of this report and imply different labor 
market outcomes. For example, Germany shows the highest level of preparedness among 
the ten European countries (around 0.8 on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0). Germany and the United 
Kingdom are two of the highest-scoring countries in terms of AI readiness.

Such differences also exist within countries. Our prior research on the future of work in 
Europe has shown that Europe has highly varied local labor markets with strong local 
specificities. In Europe, only a few dozen cities drive GDP growth, while hundreds of shrinking 
regions have declining workforces, older populations, and lower educational attainment.25 
Similar geographic concentrations exist in the United States.

While the scale of the 
occupational transitions 
required is roughly on the 
same order of magnitude 
across the economies we 
analyzed, there are notable 
differences in the mix of 
occupations likely to be 
affected in each country, 
based on our modeling.

New skills for a new era

New technologies require new workforce skills. As a result of the advent of digital, for example, 
almost all jobs, from nursing to truck driving, have some digital component today. With AI and 
gen AI on the rise, this chapter looks at which skills could be in high demand by 2030 and which 
may see a decline. 

In our McKinsey Global Institute Future of Work model, we categorized 25 workforce skills into 
five groups: physical and manual, basic cognitive, higher cognitive, social and emotional, and 
technological. We measured the current time allocation for each skill and projected the shifts 
that could be needed by 2030 as a direct consequence of the shifts in employment demand we 
modeled.26 We find that the need for technological expertise, as well as social and emotional 
skills, could continue to rise to 2030. 

We supplemented our modeling with a survey of more than 1,100 C-level executives in France, 
Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States.27 They report that some of the skills 
most valued for the future are scarce in today’s market. Companies and workers will thus need 
to pivot quickly to adapt to the changes. Businesses face critical choices about retraining staff, 
recruiting new talent, or finding alternative strategies to secure the necessary skills for a new 
era of technology.

26 See technical appendix for details. Workers use multiple skills to perform a given task, but for the purposes of our 

quantification, we identified the predominant skill used. For example, in banking and insurance, we mapped “prepare 
business correspondence” and “prepare legal or investigatory documentation” to the skill “advanced literacy and writing,” 
which is grouped in the category of higher cognitive skills. In retail, we classified “stock products or parts” into gross motor 
skills and strength in the category of physical and manual skills, while “greeting customers, patrons, or visitors” is mapped to 
basic communication skills, in the basic cognitive category.

27 The survey was conducted by Dynata in March 2024. Thirty-three percent of the companies surveyed had fewer than 500 
employees, 44 percent had 500–5,000, and the remainder were larger. Companies were active in sectors ranging from 
technology and financial services to healthcare, automotive, and retail. The survey also asked respondents to self-report 
whether their profit margin was higher or lower relative to the industry average. For details, see the technical appendix.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondOccupational transformations will require a large shift in skills

The occupational transitions outlined in the previous chapter underscore substantial shifts 
in workforce skills in a future in which automation and AI are integrated into the workplace. 
Physical skills remain important, but technological and social and emotional skills could be in 
higher demand (Exhibit 7).28 

Demand for technological skills—by which we mean the number of hours worked for which 
technological skills are predominant—could see substantial growth in Europe and in the 
United States (increases of 25 percent and 29 percent, respectively, in hours worked by 2030 
compared to 2022) under our faster, midpoint scenario of automation adoption. 

Demand for social and emotional skills could rise by 11 percent in Europe and by 14 percent in 
the United States. Underlying this increase is higher demand for roles requiring empathy and 
leadership skills, which could rise by 20 percent and 14 percent in Europe and by 23 percent 
and 15 percent in the United States by 2030, according to our analysis. These skills are crucial 
in healthcare and managerial roles in an evolving economy that demands greater adaptability 
and flexibility.

Conversely, demand for work in which basic cognitive skills are predominant is expected to 
decline. Basic cognitive skills are required primarily in office support or customer service roles, 
which are highly susceptible to being automated or enhanced by AI. Our analysis suggests 
that demand for these types of activities could decrease by 14 percent. Among these basic 
cognitive skills that characterize work experiencing significant drops in demand are basic 
data processing and literacy, numeracy, and communication (by 17 percent and 9 percent, 
respectively, in Europe and by 16 percent and 11 percent, respectively, in the United States). 

Demand for work in which higher cognitive skills are predominant would also decline slightly—
by 4 percent in Europe and 2 percent in the United States by 2030—according to our analysis. 
While creativity is expected to remain highly sought after, with a potential increase of 12 
percent in Europe and 16 percent in the United States by 2030, activities predominated by 
other advanced cognitive skills such as advanced literacy and writing, along with quantitative 
and statistical skills, could likely see lower demand, with both declining by 19 percent in 
Europe. This can be attributed to the potential of automating activities primarily requiring 
these skills and may particularly affect business and legal professions. 

Demand for work in which physical and manual skills are predominant on the other hand, 
could decrease by 1 percent by 2030 in Europe. These activities remain the largest 
share of labor, representing about 30 percent of total hours worked in 2022. Lower than 
expected decline in these  skills between 2022 and 2030 could come from the build-out 
of infrastructure and production shifts in sustainability sectors.29 Higher demand may also 
reflect a renewed focus in both Europe and the United States on industrialization and the 
reshoring of production.30 In addition, e-commerce drives demand for warehousing and 
transportation work, which involves physical and manual skills. Healthcare occupations, 
particularly in healthcare support, also require a high degree of physical skills. 

28 Estimations of future demand for skills are based on the predominant skill used to perform one activity rather than the full 

spectrum of skills used to perform an activity.

29 See Ezra Greenberg, Erik Schaefer, and Brooke Weddle, “Tradespeople wanted: The need for critical trade skills in the 

US,” McKinsey, April 9, 2024.

30 In Europe, for example, the 2024 Antwerp Declaration seeks to enhance the competitiveness, resilience, and sustainability 
of Europe’s industrial landscape by tackling significant challenges such as dwindling demand, stalled investments, and 
the need for a vigorous, green transition. Almost 700 European companies have endorsed declaration. See “The Antwerp 
Declaration for a European Industrial Deal,” accessed May 2, 2024. US legislation—including the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law and the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength 
(America COMPETES) Act—aims to modernize transportation systems, bolster supply chains, and enhance domestic 
manufacturing.

today and expect them to worsen 

The shift in skill requirements has major implications for businesses. Our survey of C-suite 
executives shows that companies are already grappling with skills challenges—and highlights 
how they are responding. 

Indeed, executives face a skills mismatch even today, particularly in technological, higher 
cognitive, and social and emotional skills: about one-third of companies report a shortfall in 
these critical areas. At the same time, a notable number of executives say they have enough 
employees with basic cognitive skills and, to a lesser extent, physical and manual skills. 
This situation stems from the shift toward a service-based economy that prioritizes higher 
cognitive and technological skills, rather than basic cognitive and physical and manual skills, 
as well as the rise of automation and AI, which diminishes the demand for easily replaceable 
skills. 

Within technological skills, companies in our survey reported that their most significant 
shortages are in advanced IT skills and programming, advanced data analysis, and 
mathematical skills. Among higher cognitive skills, significant shortfalls are seen in critical 
thinking and problem structuring and in complex information processing. About 40 percent of 
the executives surveyed pointed to a shortage of workers with these skills, which are needed 
for working alongside new technologies. Indeed, the survey highlights a demand for complex 
analytical and cognitive abilities that automation and AI have yet to supplant.

The challenge is more acute in Europe, where more companies report a shortfall of 
technological and higher cognitive skills compared to the United States; the difference is six 
percentage points for technological skills and two percentage points for higher cognitive 
skills. Conversely, more companies in Europe reported having sufficient workers with physical 
and manual skills and basic cognitive skills than in the United States. 

Skill shortages are perceived to be getting more acute: our survey shows that the skills 
projected to experience the most demand growth by 2030 are precisely those that are 
currently in shortest supply. Comparing this year’s survey results with a 2018 survey that 
examined skill shift requirements for the automation age, we find that the demand for 
skills may be even more pronounced than we suggested just six years ago.31 In our latest 
survey, about one in five respondents reported an increase in expected future skills needed 
by 2030,32 while about one in four expressed a need for more technological, social and 
emotional, and higher cognitive skills—the same skills that are perceived to be in shortage 
today. 

Technological skills have the highest overall expected need in response to the digital 
transformation of all sectors, while higher cognitive skills and social and emotional skills 
are also expected to experience significant growth in demand. Survey respondents also 
anticipate continued growth in demand for physical and manual skills and basic cognitive 
skills, although at slower rates compared to other skills, reflecting their ongoing, albeit 
diminishing, role in the evolving economic structure. Compared with the 2018 executive 
survey, companies today expect a greater need for physical and manual skills in the future 
than they previously anticipated.33 This trend is in line with the results of other recent skill-
focused research led by the World Economic Forum and others.34

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondMismatches could be even greater in skills that are not widely used today
The executives we surveyed anticipate that demand for skills will be more differentiated in the 
future. For example, within the group of technological skills, the picture varies by specific skill. 
Demand for basic IT skills is projected to grow by 15 percent, driven by the widespread need 
for proficiency across all roles. Meanwhile, demand for advanced IT skills is expected to surge 
by 34 percent, along with demand for data analytics and scientific research. This indicates 
that companies will need to acquire or build specialized technology skills even as more 
routine IT tasks are automated by AI. Coding remains a complex skill today that requires deep 
technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Demand for more technical roles requiring 
advanced IT skills will continue to grow. Similarly, within higher cognitive skills, critical thinking 
and creativity are seen as more essential skills of the future, which executives link to the need 
for innovation and strategic differentiation. Within social and emotional skills, adaptability and 
entrepreneurship are highlighted as key future needs, linked to being able to navigate future 
disruptions and embrace a culture of learning and flexibility that will be essential in adopting 
automation and AI. 

To understand the challenges companies face, we compared the expected future need 
for skills with the degree to which companies use those skills today (Exhibit 8). The skills 
that are both heavily used today and expected to significantly increase in demand include 
advanced IT, technology engineering, advanced data analytics, and creativity. Winning the 
race to acquire such skills will remain a challenge for companies. Yet they may face even 
greater challenges in acquiring skills that are less used today but predicted to be in high 
demand by 2030. These include critical thinking, complex information processing, product 
design, scientific research, and most social and emotional skills. Some skills that are widely 
used today but for which demand will grow only modestly include basic IT, basic data input, 
and equipment operation. These represent opportunities for companies to find workflow 
efficiencies and strategies for worker retraining. Finally, the skills that respondents say are not 
much in use today and will grow only modestly in demand represent niche skills (such as craft 
and technician skills) or basic nondifferentiated competencies (such as basic literacy or gross 
motor skills). 

Skill shifts vary by type of company, based on the rate of 
technology adoption and the underlying industry
In our survey, executives from companies with higher financial performance—measured 
by their self-reported net profit margin relative to peers—were more likely to anticipate 
an increase in expected future skills needed by 2030 than their lower-performing 
counterparts.35 On average, survey participants expect a 21 percent demand increase, but 
that figure rises to 30 percent among executives at higher-profit companies. This is likely 
because they have a greater capacity to invest in automation and AI technologies; companies 
that self-report higher profit margins say they allocate more than 20 percent of their digital 
budget to AI, some 14 percentage points more than medium performers (that is, executives 
who reported a similar net profit margin to their peers).

and the percentage of respondents who expect to need it less.

Executives 
from technology and financial-services companies expect a more significant increase in 
demand for skills by 2030 (at 35 percent and 21 percent growth, respectively) compared 
with those from retail, healthcare, and automotive (at 17 percent, 14 percent, and 13 percent, 
respectively). This may be because retail and healthcare have fewer workers using AI today 
than technology and financial services. Indeed, the extent of the anticipated skill shifts by 
2030 in each industry appears to be linked to technological familiarity and the disruptions 
that their adoption entails.

The adoption of technology and variations in industrial structure are leading to differing 
demands for skills across regions. For instance, US executives anticipate a greater increase 
in skill demand by 2030—on average, 13 percentage points higher than in Europe, a trend 
observed across all skill categories.

Companies see retraining as key to acquiring needed 
skills and adapting to the new work landscape

Surveyed executives expect significant changes to their workforce skill levels and worry 
about not finding the right skills by 2030. Executives said they view the lack of skills and the 
skills mismatch as barriers to future growth and profitability: more than one in four survey 
respondents report that failing to capture the needed skills could directly harm financial 
performance and indirectly impede their efforts to leverage the value from AI. 

To acquire the skills they need, companies have three main options: retraining, hiring, and 
contracting workers. Our survey suggests that executives are looking at all three options, with 
retraining the most widely reported tactic planned to address the skills mismatch: on average, 
executives plan to retrain 32 percent of employees, followed by hiring (23 percent) and 
contracting (18 percent) (Exhibit 9). Retraining is the predominant strategy across industries, 
although it varies in degree. For example, respondents in the automotive industry expect 
36 percent of their workforces to be retrained, compared with 28 percent in the financial-
services industry. 

Retraining enhances the skill sets of current employees, maintaining organizational 
knowledge and potentially boosting employee motivation and loyalty.36 While training may 
require significant time and up-front costs, companies will need to weigh the benefits of 
developing in-house training programs against those of outsourcing the training, for example 
by partnering with educational institutions. 

Hiring can be used to bring skills into an organization, but it has risks associated with talent 
shortages and the unpredictability of new hires’ performance. Companies can improve their 
hiring outcomes by using digital recruitment tools to ensure better matches, offering an 
attractive work culture and benefits, and onboarding new hires in a deliberate way. 

Contracting gives companies access to skills through contractors, freelancers, or temporary 
workers. It enables rapid skill acquisition but may lead to loss of proprietary knowledge and 
a mismatch with company culture. Currently, contracting fills primarily noncore, low-skill 
roles, but shifts are occurring as highly educated professionals, attracted by flexibility and 
autonomy, enter the contracting market and command high rates for specialized skills.

McKinsey & Company

Our survey responses suggest that these strategies have specific applications by job type. Hiring as a 
strategy seems to be relatively successful for high- and medium-skill jobs but less so for low-skill jobs—
some 76 percent of surveyed executives expect to hire high- and medium-skill workers compared to 58 
percent expecting to hire low-skill workers. Retraining and contracting follow the same trend, albeit with 
less variation among job categories.

These findings highlight the importance for companies to invest in skills development now. Transitioning 
from manual and physical skills to advanced IT skills is a time-intensive process, and early action is critical. 
By focusing on workforce training today, companies can ensure they have the necessary technological and 
other skills by 2030. Our survey results suggest that companies favor internal training programs, with 49 
percent and 44 percent of respondents, respectively, choosing to develop and provide in-house training and 
to offer on-the-job training coupled with mentorship. Internal training allows companies to better align their 
needs with the programs they offer and teach the precise skills they require. External or remote retraining 
actions are less popular but remain under consideration, with 38 percent of executives surveyed planning 
to partner externally with educational institutions. This type of action can remain relevant in learning highly 
technical skills or skills that are not yet prevalent within a company.

In this section, we examine four sectors in greater depth: wholesale and retail trade, 
financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare. Based on our modeling, we explore how 
these sectors would be affected by automation, AI, actions aimed at achieving a net-zero 
transition, e-commerce, the aging population, and other trends. Focusing on Europe and the 
United States, we assess how changes in labor demand could affect the occupational mix 
and skills demand at a sector level.

Implications for the workforce

Shifts in demand for certain skills and occupations could have a significant impact on society 
more broadly. In this chapter, we explore various potential implications.

Demand for higher-wage occupations could rise, with 
uncertain consequences for workers in lower-wage jobs

A critical question in the upcoming technological age will be which segments of the 
population capture the income benefits of AI and gen AI deployment. According to UK 
scenarios built by the IMF, AI would benefit mostly workers with above-median incomes, while 
those below the median would see limited wage increases in the best-case scenario and 
decreasing income in the worst case.37

We mapped our estimated shifts in employment demand to current wage bands of 
occupations to infer the potential impact on different types of workers. The wage levels of 
occupations might change in coming years in response to demand and supply mismatches. 
Rather than modeling future trends in wages, an uncertain exercise, we point to the 
implications of rising or falling demand for occupations in wage bands as they exist today. 

The past four decades have seen a divergence in outcomes for low- and middle-wage 
workers on the one hand and high-wage workers on the other.38 Now, technology 

37 Gen-AI: Artificial intelligence, January 2024.
38 Wage concentration is significantly higher in the United States than in European countries, although the United States 
has experienced wage compression recently. See David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew, The unexpected 
compression: Competition at work in the low wage labor market, NBER working paper, number 31010, March 2023; and 
“Inequality: A persisting challenge and its implications,” McKinsey Global Institute, June 26, 2019.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyonddevelopment and labor market disruptions could further reweight demand toward skills 
associated with higher-wage jobs. Enabling labor market transitions that allow workers 
to move from lower-pay to higher-pay work could minimize wage polarization, while rising 
demand for technological and social and emotional skills could be detrimental to workers in 
low- and middle-wage occupations if they do not have or are unable to acquire these skills.

Rising demand for occupations with currently high wages offers an opportunity
The interplay between occupational transitions and wage levels differs among countries 
based on their current occupational structure and automation potential. All ten European 
countries we examined for this report may see increasing demand for top-earning 
occupations (Exhibit 10).

Countries vary in terms of their potential reallocation toward higher-wage occupations. 
Workers in the Czech Republic and Sweden could potentially benefit the most if they can 
make the transition into higher-wage occupations with rising demand; this can be explained 
by the potential automation of production and agricultural workers and the surging demand 
for managerial positions. In fact, the Czech Republic has the highest potential to reweight 
toward high-wage occupations, with share in employment demand for the two highest-wage 
bands increasing by 3.4 percentage points. Conversely, Denmark shows a higher increase in 
demand for middle-wage occupations than other European countries.

workers to transition to higher-wage jobs
While increasing demand for high-wage occupations may present a social opportunity, low-
wage workers may need to overcome a double disadvantage: they face a risk of job loss due 
to declining demand for their occupations and, at the same time, may encounter potential 
barriers to accessing higher-paying jobs if they lack requisite skills.39 This could result in a 
temporary mismatch between job demand and skills supply.

Our analysis identifies the potential skills profile of occupations based on their current 
wages (Exhibit 11). Physical and manual skills are likely to be predominantly used in the three 
lowest-wage brackets of occupations. Basic cognitive skills could be the most used in the 
first and second brackets, while higher cognitive skills would dominate the fourth wage-
bracket occupations, indicating their association with high-paying jobs. Meanwhile, social and 
emotional, higher cognitive, and technological skills would be most prevalent in the top-wage 
occupations. Similar trends appear in the United States.40

technological, and higher cognitive skills, our analysis suggests. Indeed, 37 percent of 
workers’ time in the highest-wage occupations could be spent doing activities in which social 
and emotional skills will predominate. Technological and higher cognitive skills will also be 
needed in these high-paid jobs, where they are likely predominant, representing 27 percent 
and 25 percent of hours worked, respectively.

The rising demand for occupations that currently command higher wages—and require more 
social and emotional, technological, and higher cognitive skills—underscores the critical role 
of strategic skill acquisition. Workers will be able to move to better-compensated positions 
if they have access to effective education and retraining programs that can equip them with 
the requisite skills (see Box 3, “How generative AI could be used as a tool to enhance and 
reshape skills acquisition”). However, if workers are not reskilled appropriately or in a timely 
manner, an increasing gap will emerge between demand for and supply of highly valued 
skills. This disparity could result in labor shortages for positions in high demand—often in 
the STEM fields, as well as in business and legal professions. Such a shortage could dampen 
productivity growth and hinder AI’s growth potential.

Box 3 
How generative AI could be used as a tool to enhance and reshape skills acquisition

The daunting task of reskilling workers 
rapidly could be made easier with 
corporate learning and development 
tools that are enhanced by generative AI 
(gen AI). The technology can potentially 
reshape training from generic offerings 
to a personalized, interactive journey, 
addressing specific skills gaps and 
preparing employees for challenges.

At the outset, gen AI could craft a 
customized curriculum that discerns 
and targets the learning needs and 
skill deficits of each employee. It 
would achieve this through an analysis 
of personal profiles, effectively 
aligning learning objectives with the 
employee’s role, tenure, and location 
to ensure relevant and accelerated skill 
development. 

For content creation, gen AI could 
leverage its ability to synthesize 
vast amounts of standard operating 
procedures, compliance regulations, 
and traditional training materials into 
coherent, accessible just-in-time formats 

and nudges. This synthesis would not 
only improve engagement by simplifying 
complex information but also reduce the 
need to manage the shelf life of program 
content. 

For training delivery, gen AI could 
introduce instructional methods, 
deploying digestible, real-time training 
content across multiple platforms. By 
adapting to various learning styles and 
preferences, gen AI could deliver a 
more intuitive and interactive learning 
experience that is both scalable and 
efficient. The platform also could foster 
the development of competencies by 
enabling assessments that discern an 
employee’s understanding and retention 
of training, thus potentially ensuring that 
the transition of knowledge is effective 
and measurable. 

Last, gen AI could provide immediate, 
data-driven feedback on an employee’s 
learning progress. This would allow both 
content and format updates in real time 

for maximum efficiency and effectiveness, 
both individually and collectively. 

One case study involving a global 
specialty-materials company illustrates 
how gen AI is emerging as a tool to 
support individual professional growth. 
The US-based company faced obstacles 
in training and upskilling its workforce 
to adopt a new supply chain planning 
solution. To address this, the company 
improved support for workers’ learning 
needs by organizing a comprehensive 
digital library, integrating external 
resources, and implementing an AI 
assistant. The AI tool bolstered workers’ 
daily performance and reduced the time 
they needed for learning activities. It 
enhanced operational efficiency by up 
to 15 percent, increased productivity 
by up to 20 percent, and improved the 
accuracy of forecasts. By enabling 
workers to swiftly adapt to new methods, 
the company achieved significant gains 
in value and performance from the supply 
chain planning solution, unlocking an 
additional 10 to 15 percent in value.1

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondWorkers in low- and middle-wage jobs would be 
more likely to have to change occupations

With millions of workers in advanced economies potentially facing the prospect of 
transitioning between occupations, groups that are heavily concentrated in lower-wage 
occupations will be more likely to have to change occupations than others. But the scale of 
those differences varies between European countries and the United States (Exhibit 12). 
In Europe, workers in the two lowest-wage-bracket occupations will be three to five times 
more likely to have to change occupations compared to the top wage earners, our analysis 
finds. The disparity is much higher in the United States, where workers in the two lowest-
wage-bracket occupations are ten to 14 times more likely to face occupational shifts than the 
highest earners. In Europe, the middle-wage population could be almost twice as affected by 
occupational transitions as the same population in United States, representing 7.3 percent of 
the working population who might face occupational transitions.

Intervention mechanisms to support labor market transitions would need to be designed 
to address the needs of those most at risk of displacement. Based on current labor 
demographics in both Europe and the United States, workers with lower educational 
attainment are disproportionately represented among those who may need to find new types 
of work by 2030. The need for higher qualifications is likely to surge as the demand for jobs 
that require higher levels of formal education—STEM jobs and roles in the health professions, 
for example—increases demand for tertiary degrees. However, occupational shifts will 
primarily concern those without a tertiary education. Similarly, certain types of lower- and 
middle-wage occupations, such as clerical roles, that are highly susceptible to automation, 
tend to be disproportionately held by women currently. The importance of reskilling for all 
workers in occupations that face a higher need for transition cannot be overemphasized. 

In Europe, workers in the 
two lowest-wage brackets 
will be three to five times 
more likely to have to change 
occupations compared 
to top wage earners.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondConclusion

Enhancing productivity 
and human capital in a time 
of technological ferment

Many structural trends will shape the future of work—from AI and automation to the 
transition to net-zero emissions and rising demand for healthcare services. Yet the primacy 
of technological transformation as a driver of changes in the future of work is hard to ignore. 
The technology adoption we describe in this report will drive both the occupational transitions 
and skills upgrades that will be needed in the decade to come, as well as the productivity 
growth that will be possible. Organizations and policy makers have choices to make; the 
way they approach AI and automation, along with human capital augmentation, will affect 
economic and societal outcomes. Will they go all out to adopt the new technologies quickly? 
In their adoption strategy, will they also focus actively on the occupational transitions ahead, 
looking to raise skill levels and enhance human capital while they automate? In this concluding 
chapter, we look at these choices and their implications for businesses, policy makers, and 
overall productivity growth.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondChoices for managing the technology and workforce transition

Technology is not intrinsically good or bad. Artificial intelligence, like other technologies, can 
produce positive or negative outcomes—and often both—depending on how it is deployed. 
Policy makers and businesses face significant choices about what to prioritize and how to 
manage potential trade-offs between technological deployment and the furthering of human 
capital. How they think about these choices will be decisive for human capital and societal 
well-being more broadly.

Building on previous work on the deployment of technology for social good,41 we have 
identified the need to address a critical factor: the way in which the workforce and skills 
transition is managed. 

The stance of businesses affects workers’ capabilities and the pace at which technologies 
can spread through the economy. Companies taking a proactive stance (or path) would 
anticipate and implement technological changes while establishing worker training 
structures, supporting employees, and seeking to attract the right talent. Such an approach 
might require significant capital investment and training hours. Policy makers would also 
have a role to play—for example, by potentially framing smart public policies that facilitate

occupational transitions while supporting skill 
building.42 Developing “lighthouse examples” 
in public services could be one important 
way to show the path toward human capital 
development. For example, the French 
government recently introduced “Albert,” a 
large language model assistant designed to 
help civil servants search for information and 
formulate specific responses.43 

Conversely, a reactive stance (or path) would 
inherently pay little heed to the capability-
building and human capital implications of 
automation. This path may appear easier in 
the short term—for example, it may require 
less effort and incur lower immediate costs for 
companies. But it comes with risks, both for 
companies and for society more broadly. For 
example, workers might lose their jobs and be 
unable to find their way into occupations for 
which demand is rising. And companies may be 
unable to participate fully in the technological 
transition because they lack much-needed AI 
capabilities. If such issues become widespread, 
they may ultimately choke technology 
deployment for the economy as a whole, 
hindering growth.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondEstimating the productivity implications of the technological transition for Europe
The approach that businesses take to technology deployment and skills transitions affects 
the balance between job displacement and productive job creation. Thus it also affects overall 
economic productivity. We have attempted to quantify at a high level the potential effects of 
different stances to technology deployment on productivity in Europe. For this exercise, we 
refer to productivity (rather than income or GDP) to measure economic potential and express 
the results as annual growth rate in productivity until 2030. This exercise focuses on all the 
European economies we looked at in this report.

Our analysis considers two dimensions. The first is the adoption rate of AI and automation 
technologies. We consider two of our scenarios outlined earlier in chapter 2: the “faster” 
scenario and the “late” scenario for technology adoption. As discussed in chapter 2, faster 
adoption would unlock greater AI growth potential but also, potentially, more short-term labor 
disruption than the late scenario. The late scenario anticipates about 2 percent of time spent 
on current work activities to be automated by 2030, in contrast to the 27 percent assumed in 
the faster scenario. The second dimension we consider is the level of automated worker time 
that is redeployed into the economy. This represents the ability to redeploy the time gained by 
automation and productivity gains (for example, new tasks and job creation). This could vary 
depending on the success of worker training programs and strategies to match demand and 
supply in labor markets. We based our analysis on two potential scenarios: either all current 
work hours automated are fully redeployed into the economy at a similar productivity level as 
in 2022 or only some 80 percent of the automated workers’ time will be redeployed into the 
economy. 

Exhibit 13 illustrates the various outcomes in terms of annual productivity growth rate. 
The top-right quadrant illustrates the highest economy-wide productivity, with an annual 
productivity growth rate of up to 3.1 percent. It requires fast adoption of technologies 
(faster scenario) as well as full redeployment of automated hours. The top-left quadrant 
also demonstrates technology adoption on a fast trajectory and shows a relatively high 
productivity growth rate (up to 2.5 percent). However, about 6 percent of total hours worked 
(equivalent to 10.2 million people not working) would not be redeployed in the economy, 
meaning that some affected workers could be unable to find meaningful ways to reenter 
the economy—a painful outcome for many with potential social implications. Finally, the two 
bottom quadrants depict the failure to adopt AI and automation, leading to limited productivity 
gains and translating into limited labor market disruptions. In terms of productivity levels, 
these would be the least favorable outcomes, with annual productivity growth at 0.3 percent 
or below.

While this calculation is a thought exercise, it nonetheless highlights the impact that decisions 
and choices made today could have in the future. The calculation is for 2030, but it would be a 
starting point for upcoming decades.

Up to 2.5Up to 3.1Up to 0.2Up to 0.3A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondFour priorities for companies

Companies will need to transform and retrain their workforces to adapt to the new work 
landscape. The decisions they make today could help them boost both growth and human 
capital development. Already, many employers seem ready to take on the challenge—and 
they have the potential to create a new ethos of AI social responsibility.44

The adoption of automation technologies will be decisive in protecting businesses’ 
competitive advantage in an automation and AI era. To ensure successful deployment at a 
company level, business leaders can embrace four priorities (Exhibit 14): 

Understand the potential. What is the potential impact of automation technologies, and what 
is the starting point? Leaders need to understand the potential of these technologies, notably 
including how AI and gen AI can augment and automate work. This includes estimating both 
the total capacity that these technologies could free up and their impact on role composition 
and skills requirements. Understanding this allows business leaders to frame their end-
to-end strategy and adoption goals with regard to these technologies. As an example, one 
leading financial institution analyzed the current activities of its workforce and concluded that 
AI and gen AI have the potential to save about half of worked-hour capacity at the company. 
While this finding will need to be tempered by the adoption strategy the company puts in 
place, it nonetheless highlights the very significant potential workforce implications of these 
technologies. 

Plan a strategic workforce shift. What are the key steps to identifying the starting point 
of the transformation? Once they understand the potential of automation technologies, 
leaders need to plan the company’s shift toward readiness for the automation and AI era. This 
requires sizing the workforce and skill needs, based on strategically identified use cases, to 
assess the potential future talent gap. From this analysis will flow details about the extent 
of recruitment of new talent, upskilling, or reskilling of the current workforce that is needed, 
as well as where to redeploy freed capacity to more value-added tasks. As an example, a 
large financial institution successfully pinpointed its key opportunity pools for AI and gen AI 
implementation by estimating 2030 talent gaps compared with its current workforce. This 
enabled the company to determine that AI and gen AI had immediate potential to fill skills 
gaps for two main groups of roles: those with the largest projected workforce gaps in 2030, 
such as data science, information security, and business intelligence, and those with the 
highest business value, such as machine learning engineering and software engineering. 
This led the company to put a priority on filling those gaps, through both talent sprints 
and the deployment of AI and gen AI use cases to address anticipated talent shortages 
in those functions. In another example, a leading US financial firm partnered with large 
language model vendors to develop its own gen AI solutions. The firm set up an operating 
model with a center of excellence to guide the effort and get the most out of more than 150 
use cases deployed. This effort included value measurement and close collaboration with 
compliance, legal, and risk departments. For all businesses, these kinds of strategies offer a 
prime opportunity to enhance operational efficiency and output growth, build trust with the 
workforce, and overcome some of the hurdles posed by labor shortages.

44 While our report focuses on the potential labor market impact of AI, the technology has many broader benefits and also 
raises important concerns such as security and privacy. The responsible use of AI is increasingly the focus of evolving 
company actions, policies and regulations. For a previous discussion of this topic, see Jacques Bughin and Eric Hazan, 
“Can artificial intelligence help society as much as it helps business?,” McKinsey Quarterly, August 6, 2019.

56

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondPrioritize people development. Who does the company need to succeed in this 
transformation? To ensure that the right talent is on hand to sustain the company strategy 
during all transformation phases, leaders could consider setting up dedicated talent “win 
rooms”45 to identify, attract, and recruit future AI and gen AI leaders in a tight market. They 
also will likely need to accelerate the building of AI and gen AI capabilities in the workforce. 
Nontechnical talent will also need training to adapt to the changing skills environment. Finally, 
leaders could deploy an HR strategy and operating model to fit the post–gen AI workforce.46 
To that end, companies are increasingly setting up AI and gen AI departments specifically 
to spearhead gen AI transformation efforts. These include roles focusing on strategy along 
with technical roles essential for executing strategies and developing future gen AI expertise 
across the organization. As an example, a Caribbean-based bank recently implemented 
specific gen AI–supported coding solutions to improve the productivity of its more than 
100 software developers and attract new talent. To bring software developers up to speed 
quickly, the bank provided four immersive, hands-on half days of training on using gen AI tools 
optimally and responsibly. As a result, 80 percent of the software developers indicated that 
the solutions improved their coding experience and were easy to adopt. 

Pursue the executive-education journey on automation technologies. Leaders also need 
to undertake their own education journey on automation technologies to maximize their 
contributions to their companies during the coming transformation. This includes empowering 
senior managers to explore automation technologies implications and subsequently role 
model to others, as well as bringing all company leaders together to create a dedicated road 
map to drive business and employee value. A fundamental objective of this journey is for 
leaders to not only reskill but also achieve a deep understanding of the value and challenges 
that gen AI poses. This nuanced comprehension is crucial for formulating more-effective 
strategies and fostering a collective conviction about the transformation within leadership. 
As an example, when a motor racing league developed its next-generation electric racing 
car with the objective of breaking indoor land speed records and exciting fans in a new way, 
two gen AI models supported the ground team, helped guide the driver, and allowed the 
fans to “communicate” with the cars (for example, asking the car, “How fast can you go on 
this straight line during this lap?”). To make this a success, all the teams had to collaborate, 
from the league’s chief technical officer to the motor engineers and the drivers themselves. 
Another example is a Europe-based global telecommunications and media company that has 
held dedicated board workshops to demystify gen AI and shape the gen AI road map. Such 
comprehensive involvement ensures that leaders are not just strategy setters but also deeply 
informed and engaged participants in the gen AI transformation.

45 The “talent win room” model creates a hub for prioritizing and executing on the most pressing talent needs. Win rooms 
are based on two key mandates: fast-track all critical talent decisions (for example, talent acquisition, attraction, and 
selection) and adapt rapidly to all new workforce practices (for example, a laboratory environment for new ways of 
working).

McKinsey & Company

Work is not static. Labor markets have been in a state of flux since the Industrial Revolution 
and continue to change, particularly as new technologies come into play and take over 
activities previously undertaken by human labor—which then adapts and finds new work that 
makes use of the new technologies. Will this pattern continue? AI and the toolbox of advanced 
new technologies are evolving at a breathtaking pace. For companies and policy makers, 
these technologies are highly compelling because they promise a range of benefits, including 
higher productivity, which could lift growth and prosperity. Yet, as this report has sought to 
illustrate, making full use of the advantages on offer will also require paying attention to the 
critical element of human capital. In the best-case scenario, workers’ skills will develop and 
adapt to new technological challenges. Achieving this goal in our new technological age 
presents significant challenges—but the benefits will be great.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondTechnical appendix

This report draws on the methodology and findings from two 2023 McKinsey Global Institute 
(MGI) reports: Generative AI and the future of work in America and The economic potential 
of generative AI. A full description of the methodology used is detailed in the technical 
appendices of those reports. Below is a brief summary of the methodology and how it was 
applied to produce the findings of this report. We also conducted a proprietary survey to 
assess current and future skill demand influenced by AI adoption and evaluate strategies to 
address the skills gap. For details about the terms we use throughout the report, see Box, “A 
note on terminology.”

Model methodology

Our model includes the following data and assumptions:

Employment. Our analysis draws on aggregated employment and growth projections from 
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Eurostat, and the following national statistics agencies: 
the Czech Statistical Office, France’s National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies 
(INSEE), Germany’s Federal Statistical Office, the Italian National Institute of Statistics 
(Istat), Spain’s National Statistics Institute (INE), Statistics Denmark, Statistics Netherlands 
(CBS), Statistics Poland, Statistics Sweden, and the UK Office for National Statistics. Where 
employment projections were not available from national sources, we used projections 
from Oxford Economics. Granular occupational-level data across sectors was not available 
for the Czech Republic, Italy, and Poland. To derive employment insights, we estimated 
the occupational structure of these countries by benchmarking with other countries in our 
European sample and scaled to match the country level aggregates. Our analysis does not 
seek to predict overall employment levels; rather, it models various factors driving labor 
demand to understand how occupational composition may change. 

Automation potential and adoption scenarios. To analyze the impact of automation on work 
activities, the MGI model breaks down some 850 occupations into about 2,100 constituent 
activities using data from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). Each activity 
was further mapped to a set of 18 capabilities required to perform that activity. For all 18 
capabilities, we assess current availability of technology and scenarios for future availability 
across required proficiency levels. This helps us assess the automation potential for an 
activity today and in the future. This potential at an activity level is further aggregated by time 
spent on those activities in an occupation to calculate occupation-level automation potential. 
These occupational estimates are then aggregated at sector and country level by a weighted 
average of employment in respective occupations to estimate overall impact. 

Scenarios for automation adoption. Several factors can hinder or enable the timing and 
pace of adoption. Solutions requiring different technologies have varying levels of ease of 
integration. It takes time to integrate capabilities into current technical platforms and combine 
them into an organic entity. Further, these solutions have to be economically feasible relative 
to the labor cost or wages in order to allow organizations to implement at scale. Barriers 
also exist on the organizational side. Human talent and organizational structures might 
act as bottlenecks to implementation. Policies and regulations can also affect the pace of 
technology innovation and adoption. Finally, depending on their preferences, consumers 
might have varying levels of acceptance for automated solutions that could affect the pace 
of adoption. To incorporate all these factors, we used the mathematics of the Bass diffusion 
model, a well-known and widely used function in forecasting, especially for new product sales 
forecasting and technology forecasting.

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondƒ(t)/1-F(t) = (p + qF(t))

F(t) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of a given technology or product) and f(t) is 
the corresponding rate of change. 

We then simulated two scenarios for historic technology adoption curves. The fitted 
values of parameters p and q are consistent with historical adoption curves for multiple 
technologies. It takes about five years to reach 50 percent adoption in the earliest scenario 
and approximately 16 years in the latest scenario. 

Impact of automation on productivity. In our model we used GDP per full-time equivalent 
employee (FTE) as the measure of productivity. To measure automation’s effect on 
productivity, we first calculate FTEs impacted by automation by multiplying the projected 
number of FTEs in 2030 by the estimated automation adoption rate. To maintain consistency 
with other data sources, we made several additional assumptions. We consider only job 
activities that are currently available and well defined as of the date of this report. Also, 
to be conservative, we assume automation has a labor substitution effect but no other 
performance gains. Finally, we create a scenario in which FTEs displaced by automation rejoin 
the workforce at 2022 productivity levels. Under the assumptions outlined above, we first 
calculate the additional GDP impact of FTEs joining back the labor force after the defined 
automation adoption scenario, as follows: 

Additional GDP from displaced FTEs joining back the economy =  
FTE impact of automation adoption X productivity of 2022. 

The additional GDP is then added to 2022 GDP, to derive the productivity impact and its 
growth over 2022–30.

Impact of net-zero transition. The European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States have made international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net 
zero by 2050. We examined the impact of these commitments on jobs using a scenario-
based analysis drawing on the approach used by NGFS (scenario REMIND-MAgPIE 2.1-
4.1, published in June 2022). We have built on previous McKinsey research assessing the 
impact at a global level to analyze the specific implications for the European Union, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States, adding sectoral and occupational dimensions to 
the analysis. This net-zero analysis assumes that current supply chain composition remains 
the same until 2030. We consider the impact of the European Union, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States meeting their own emissions targets as well as their role in meeting 
global demand for products. Jobs gained and lost are allocated as per the occupational mix 
of 2022. We have considered job losses and gains directly and indirectly associated with the 
transition for operations and maintenance and capital expenditure. We do not include other 
macroeconomic forces such as population and income growth.

Long-term labor market trends. In estimating labor demand, we factored in six 
macroeconomic catalysts—rising incomes, healthcare and aging, technological innovation, 
infrastructure investment, education, and the marketization of unpaid work—across the 
economy. We captured direct and indirect jobs that could be created from each catalyst by 
leveraging job multipliers from input-output tables. 

Trends accelerated by COVID-19. We incorporated broad trends accelerated by the pandemic 
that may influence labor demand and jobs in the economy through 2030, including increased 
remote work and virtual meetings and the shift to e-commerce and other virtual transactions. 

61

A new future of work: The race to deploy AI and raise skills in Europe and beyondSkills demand and transitions. Our skills demand and transition modeling is based on the 
framework devised in MGI’s May 2018 report, Skill shift: Automation and the future of the 
workforce. We looked at 25 workforce skills that fall into five broad categories: physical 
and manual, basic cognitive, higher cognitive, social and emotional, and technological. The 
number of hours that workers spend performing specific work activities were then mapped 
to a predominant skill. Since one-to-one mapping of skills and activities undercounts 
digital skills, we corrected this by reallocating a portion of hours from activities requiring 
nontechnological skills to those requiring basic digital skills.

Box
A note on terminology

We use the term “occupational shifts” to mean 
declines in employment in specific occupations 
between 2016 and 2022. (We do not include gains 
in this calculation to avoid double counting.) 

Since the number of total workers grew over this 
period, losses in some occupations were offset 
or more than offset by gains in other occupations. 
From the gross declines in each occupation, 
we also reduced a proportional share of total 
retirements. We calculated this by taking the 
number of total retirements and allocating a share 
to each occupation according to its proportion of 
workers aged 65 and over. 

However, we do not know exactly how many 
individuals moved from one occupation to another 
or if they made multiple moves; for that reason, 
we refer to the number of occupational shifts that 
occurred during this period rather than specifying 
the number of workers making those changes. 

Much of our analysis looks at occupational 
categories. Each of those categories contains 
multiple occupations. A move from one occupation 
to another within the same category is counted 
as a shift (in historical context) or a transition 
(in the context of future projections). Within any 
given category, some individual occupations may 
experience declines while others increase. 

Proprietary skills demand survey methodology

We complemented the labor demand analysis of our model with a survey of executives to 
gauge current and future expectations of demand for skills.

Target sample. To supplement the findings of our model, we ran a proprietary skill survey 
in March 2024 with 1,128 C-level executives from five representative countries: France, 
Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Survey respondents came from a 
range of industrial sectors, per the NACE statistical classification of economic activities used 
in the European Union, and included all types of companies with 50 employees or more. 

Collection methodology. Respondents were asked to provide insights on three key areas: 
(1) current and future skill demands, (2) the impact of AI and AI adoption on workforce skills 
demand, and (3) companies’ strategies for bridging the existing skills gap. Participants 
responded to a ten-minute online survey that focused on both the present (2024) and a 
forecasted future (2030) regarding these three aspects (exhibit). Additionally, we compared 
our results with the World Economic Forum’s The future of jobs report 2023 and found similar 
results in both the scale and types of skill shifts needed.
