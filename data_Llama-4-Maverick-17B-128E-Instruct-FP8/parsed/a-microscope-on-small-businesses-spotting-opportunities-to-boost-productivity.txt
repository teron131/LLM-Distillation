 — Micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) form the backbone of economies. 
Across the 16 countries we examine, MSMEs account for two-thirds of business employment 
in advanced economies—and almost four-fifths in emerging economies—as well as half 
of all value added. They also power dynamism and will play an important role in preserving 
competitiveness in an era of shifting global production.

 — Boosting MSME productivity relative to large companies could yield significant value. 
Small business productivity is only half that of large companies, and less in emerging 
economies. Raising MSMEs to top-quartile levels relative to large companies is equivalent  
to 5 percent of GDP in advanced economies and 10 percent in emerging economies.

 — Capturing this value requires a fine-grained view. Relative productivity of MSMEs and 
large companies varies widely across subsector and country. For example, in virtually all 
countries, eight subsectors out of 24 drive more than 60 percent of the value of narrowing 
the productivity gap in manufacturing, but the top ones vary by country.

 — A win-win economic fabric can improve productivity for both MSMEs and large 

enterprises. MSME and large company productivity move in tandem in most subsectors, 
indicating spillovers if the right conditions are created. For example, automotive MSMEs 
have gained operational proficiency through systematic interactions with productive original 
equipment manufacturers, and small software developers have benefited from talent and 
capital ecosystems seeded by larger companies.

 — All stakeholders have a role to play in developing granular productivity strategies. 
In subsectors where both small and large companies lag, infrastructure and policy 
improvements can target both together. Where MSMEs struggle but large enterprises 
outperform, building networks among them helps. Even where both large and small 
companies do well, strengthening their interactions could boost productivity.

Introduction

Micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) are the lifeblood of economies around the 
world. They account for more than 90 percent of all businesses, roughly half of value added, and 
more than two-thirds of business employment.1

But small businesses lag behind large companies on productivity. On average, their labor 
productivity, or value added per worker, is half that of their larger peers. Accelerating productivity 
growth has always been the sure way to deliver long-term prosperity, and MSMEs can—must—
play a crucial role. Their contribution is potentially even more important amid the beginnings of a 
reconfiguration of global trade patterns.2 Such shifts are unlikely to translate into a meaningful 
long-term realignment without a competitive network of MSMEs supporting and complementing 
large companies. 

If MSMEs were to narrow the productivity gap with large companies, not only could that 
breathe new life into economy-wide productivity, employment, and growth, but economies and 
companies could raise their resilience in an uncertain world. The question is how. 

Only by studying MSMEs at the fine-grained level can we understand where and why 
opportunities exist and plot a path toward higher productivity for all. After all, MSMEs are 
immensely varied. They range from a self-employed individual, such as a taxi driver or an online 
game designer; to a microenterprise with one to nine employees, like a laundry or a dental 
practice; to a small enterprise with up to 50 employees, such as a bakery or local auto repair 
chain; to a medium-size furniture manufacturing company or software business employing up to 
250 people. 

In this research, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has aggregated a richly granular data set 
of MSME productivity across sectors and subsectors for 16 countries with different income 
levels accounting for more than 50 percent of global GDP. In this group (listed by per capita 
GDP in 2021 in purchasing power parity terms) are ten advanced economies: the United States, 
Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Israel, Japan, Spain, Poland, and Portugal; and six 
emerging economies: Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, India, Nigeria, and Kenya.3 At the sector level, 
in the manufacturing sector, for instance, our data cover 24 level-two subsectors and 95 level-
three subsectors.4 This enables us to explore the details of businesses that are highly diverse in 
size, economic context, degree of formalization, and, especially, the nature of economic activity 
in which they engage (see sidebar “Definitions, scope, and data limitations”). Most previous 
external analysis has tended to study MSMEs in a single country or has compared productivity 
among countries within a particular sector.5

This research focuses on the variation in MSME productivity relative to large companies across 
sectors, subsectors, and countries, enabled by our rich data set. We use this microscopic, 
but cross-country, lens to spot potential value and identify how MSMEs can work with other 
companies in specific business contexts to capture it. 

2

A microscope on small businessesDefinitions, scope, and data limitations

The data collected for this research are 
arguably deeper and broader than those 
collated in the past. Here we present 
an overview of our approach. (See the 
technical appendix for more detail on the 
data sources and analysis undertaken in 
this research.)

Types of MSMEs studied. We examine 
a diverse array of MSMEs, from self-
employed workers and entrepreneurs 
to mom-and-pop shops and small 
family businesses, across 16 countries. 
One notable exception is smallholder 
farmers, most of whom can be considered 
small business owners and constitute 
a substantial portion of the workforce, 
particularly in emerging economies. For 
example, in 2022, the agriculture sector 
employed 29 percent of the workforce in 
Indonesia, 33 percent in Kenya, 38 percent 
in Nigeria, and 43 percent in India. In 
this research, we focus on the nonfarm 
sector and do not examine agricultural 
productivity, which has its own unique 
dynamics, meriting a separate study. 

MSME size category definitions. 
Enterprise sizes are typically defined by 
the number of persons employed. We take 
each country’s national definition of micro-, 
small, and medium-size enterprises. For 
example, for European economies in our 
sample, we used the OECD’s definition 
of MSMEs. The OECD thresholds are as 
follows: microenterprises employ nine 
people or fewer, small enterprises employ 
between ten and 49 people, medium-size 
companies between 50 and 249, and 
large companies 250 or more. However, 
definitions of enterprise sizes may vary 
by country. For example, in the United 
States, large companies are defined as 

having  500 or more employees. Indonesia 
and Kenya define businesses with 100 or 
more employees as large, and Nigeria sets 
the threshold at 200. India and Indonesia 
define MSMEs based on their revenue and 
their investment in plant and equipment 
as well as employment. While this makes 
cross-country comparisons inexact, it 
enables us to use reported data more 
directly and to limit assumptions. 

Scope of data. We gathered data on 
value added and employment by sector 
(classified based on economic activity) 
across corporate size classes (micro, 
small, medium, and large) from country-
level economic and business censuses, 
MSME and labor surveys, and aggregated 
databases, such as those of Eurostat, 
OECD, ILOSTAT, and S&P Global Market 
Intelligence. Typically, we use 2019 data 
to exclude potential distortions due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. However, for 
availability reasons, the dates used range 
from 2016 to 2019 across countries.1

Level of aggregation. We aggregated data 
at the level of 12 level-one sectors (for 
example, manufacturing) and 68 level-two 
subsectors (for example, manufacturing of 
textiles within the manufacturing sector), 
as defined by the International Standard 
Industrial Classification of All Economic 
Activities (ISIC), Revision 4 or equivalent. 
For the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and 
the European economies in our sample, 
we also collected data for 219 level-three 
subsectors (for example, manufacturing 
of carpets and rugs within manufacturing 
of textiles). The 12 level-one sectors are 
mining and quarrying; manufacturing; 
electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning 
supply; water supply, sewerage, waste 

management, and remediation activities; 
construction; wholesale and retail 
trade; transportation and storage; 
accommodation and food services 
activities; information and communications 
technology (ICT); professional, scientific, 
and technical activities; administrative 
and support service activities; and other 
service activities.2

Sectoral data for some countries,  
typically the emerging economies, are 
not as granular as for the advanced 
economies. For cross-country 
comparisons, we used a combination 
of data sources, including a sector 
breakdown of employment from ILOSTAT, 
and distinguished between MSMEs and 
large companies using national sources. 
In some cases, we also conducted 
comparisons at a less granular level by 
grouping two or three level-two sectors. 

Measuring productivity. Productivity is 
a measure of output relative to input.3 In 
macroeconomic terms, it is defined as the 
value of the goods and services produced 
divided by the amount of labor, capital, and 
other resources required for its production. 
For this report, we focus on labor 
productivity, measured as value added 
per worker (in US dollars at purchasing 
power parity). While the more accurate 
measure of labor productivity is value 
added per hour worked—as the number of 
weekly hours worked varies substantially 
among countries, from 31 hours in 
Australia in 2023 to roughly 46 hours in 
India—we use the per worker metric as it 
is more commonly available across size 
categories by country. Due to the lack 
of comprehensive data at the individual 
company level for MSMEs, we rely on 

1  To verify stability of the data, we examined data from 2009 and 2014 for some countries but did not collect complete longitudinal data due to the significant effort involved. 

However, the topic of understanding trends in MSME productivity would be a valuable area for future research.

2  We grouped two sectors—electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply; and water supply, sewerage, waste management, and remediation activities—into one  

sector: utilities.

subsector-level average productivity to 
make inferences.4

Other important limitations. Our research 
reflects the challenges of working with 
significant constraints on data availability. 
For all the countries in our sample, we 
included data for both formal and informal 
sectors, although we recognize that data 
pertaining to the informal sector are 
often less reliable. Beyond informality, 
as consistent data were not always 
available across countries, we had to 
exclude certain sectors from our analysis. 
Because of inconsistent data availability, 
across countries we exclude financial 

services; real estate; education; human 
health and social work activities; arts and 
entertainment; public administration and 
defense; and activities of households 
and extraterritorial organizations. These 
sectors play a substantial role, particularly 
in advanced economies where they 
contribute 37 percent of value added, on 
average, ranging from 26 percent in Poland 
to 43 percent in the United States. As 
noted, we also exclude agriculture despite 
its significant contribution to the economy. 
These exclusions imply that our findings 
may not be entirely representative of the 
entire economy and are limited to the 

narrower “business” economy. Similarly, 
from a country perspective, we do not 
cover some major emerging economies, 
such as China, and regions, such as the 
Middle East and North Africa, due to 
limited data availability. We also include 
only a selected set of advanced economies 
in our research. As such, we cannot 
state definitively the degree to which our 
conclusions are globally representative. 
While we derive broad and generalized 
implications for emerging and advanced 
economies, these are directional only. 

4  We focus on national- or sector-level productivity from a growth economics perspective. Organizational productivity research often studies issues related to attrition, 

disengagement, skills mismatch, or time inefficiency. See, for example, Aaron De Smet, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, Angelika Reich, and Bill Schaninger, “Some employees 
are destroying value. Others are building it. Do you know the difference?,” McKinsey Quarterly, September 2023.

MSMEs are ubiquitous and play vital economic roles across countries, albeit with important 
differences depending on whether they operate in an emerging or advanced economy. 

MSMEs fuel economy-wide production and jobs

MSMEs create enormous value for economies around the world. They account for roughly half 
of global GDP. That share varies significantly among economies (Exhibit 1). In Portugal, Israel, 
Indonesia, Italy, and Kenya (ordered by decreasing share of value added), the share is larger than 
60 percent. In the United States, Nigeria, and India, it is less than 40 percent.

They are also significant employers, accounting for roughly 40 percent of all employment 
and 70 percent of employment in the business sector, which we define as excluding the farm, 
government, and finance sectors. That share is as high as 96 percent in Kenya, where MSMEs 
account for half of all employment. 

The business sector plays a larger role in advanced economies. But within the business sector, 
MSMEs have a greater impact in emerging economies, employing four-fifths of all workers, 
compared with two-thirds in advanced economies.

MSMEs are also meaningful job creators.6 In advanced economies, one 2013 study suggested, 
they contributed more than half of net job growth in businesses.7 In the United States, for 
example, SMEs have accounted for two out of every three jobs added in the past 25 years.8 In 
emerging economies, MSMEs created seven out of ten new formal jobs over the past decade.9

MSMEs play a crucial role in production across sectors, but their contribution is more significant 
in some (Exhibit 2). While there are differences among countries, MSMEs tend to contribute the 
majority of the value added in four sectors—accommodation and food, construction, professional 
services, and trade. Although they contribute only about 45 percent of value added in the 
manufacturing sector, they are the second-largest contributor to small business value after the 
trade sector. Across all sectors, MSMEs also employ at least half of all business workers.

MSMEs drive business dynamism
Many MSMEs grow rapidly into large companies, adding to the vibrancy and dynamism of the 
economies in which they operate. They promote innovation and competition among companies, 
encouraging all businesses to continually improve their products, services, and processes, 
which, in turn, can enhance overall economy-wide productivity and dynamism. 

Many large companies of today were MSMEs not long ago. About one in five of today’s very large 
companies—defined as having a market capitalization of more than $10 billion in the United 
States and equivalent values in other economies—were MSMEs at some point after 2000 and 
have since powered their way to large company status. 

The share of scaled-up companies varies by country, indicating different levels of MSME 
dynamism (Exhibit 3). Dynamic MSMEs can stimulate competition among businesses, driving 
the entire system to become more innovative and efficient, ultimately resulting in increased 
productivity.10 Yet overall, rising productivity—crucially, that of large companies—can create new

market opportunities and build business capabilities for smaller enterprises, raising the rate of 
scaling up. 

Unique factors at the country level can contribute to dynamism. In Australia, high dynamism 
reflects a resources boom that has expanded growth opportunities for small mining companies. 
Israel, by contrast, has a small economy, but one of the most technologically advanced in the 
world.11 Its dynamism is connected to entrepreneurial ecosystems, a high density of skilled 
professionals, an ability to tap into global networks, and large-scale lending to MSMEs.12 Over 
the past decade, growth in bank credit to SMEs in Israel was higher than to large businesses, at 
61 percent versus 16 percent.13 In India, only about 10 percent of large companies in 2022 were 
MSMEs at some point after 2000. Indeed, previous MGI research found that India has a “missing 
middle” of mid-size companies.14 MSMEs have faced structural barriers, such as the high cost of 
compliance and finance, that have tended to constrain their growth. 

Researchers have found that high-growth businesses in advanced economies tend to be 
younger and intangibles heavy. Enterprises that tend to rely on profits rather than external 
financing to fund their growth are also more likely to scale up.15 Our analysis finds that in the 
information and communications technology (ICT) and mining sectors, one in three enterprises 
that are large today have grown from being MSMEs in the past two decades (Exhibit 4). These 
sectors seem to experience a fast pace of innovation and technological disruption as well as 
higher rates of investment.16

A microscope on small businessesMSMEs in the emerging economies in our sample seem to exhibit greater dynamism than in 
advanced economies in core sectors like construction, utilities, and transportation. Investment 
in physical infrastructure tends to rise faster in countries that are in the earlier stages of their 
development. Where such sector growth opportunities have been captured, we see greater 
business dynamism.

Some emerging economies have powered national growth through the manufacturing and trade 
sectors as well. In a similar analysis of companies founded after 1950, in China—not included in 
our sample, as noted—the dynamism of the manufacturing and trade sectors is higher than in the 
advanced economies on average. 

MSMEs can boost national productivity while staying small or by  
fueling larger companies

In emerging economies, the MSMEs that are so vital to sustaining livelihoods are heavily skewed 
toward microenterprises. In India, Kenya, and Nigeria, microenterprises employ more than 
90 percent of MSME workers, of whom some 90 percent are self-employed own-account 
workers and contributing family members. They face challenges of particularly low productivity.17

As these emerging economies climb the income ladder, microenterprises may grow their revenue 
and productivity, but most tend to stay small or medium size.18 As a result, MSMEs as a group

aggregate productivity growth. 

In richer economies, the dynamic is different. Much of employment has shifted away from 
microenterprises to small and medium-size companies or even to larger ones. Only about half of 
all MSME workers are employed in microenterprises. As these advanced economies climb the 
income ladder, beyond a certain point more MSMEs tend to scale up into larger companies, are 
taken over and merged into them, or simply exit in the process known as creative destruction. 
As a result, the contribution of large businesses to the national output of the richest economies 
rises, relative to that of small companies. As such, MSMEs may not increase their share of 
economies, but they still contribute to business dynamism. 

In emerging economies, the MSMEs 
that are so vital to sustaining 
livelihoods are heavily skewed 
toward microenterprises.

Despite their central role in economies across the world, MSMEs are only about half as 
productive as large companies, and narrowing that gap could create significant value.  
Yet somewhat unexpectedly, this gap is by no means monolithic: relative productivity 
performance varies enormously across countries and sectors, and even within the same  
sector among countries. 

MSME productivity lags behind that of large companies 

The MSME productivity gap—defined as the distance between MSME productivity and that of 
large companies—varies among countries. For example, in Kenya, MSMEs are just 6 percent 
as productive as large companies, translating to a hefty 94 percent productivity gap. Among 
the countries we investigate, MSMEs are relatively most productive in the United Kingdom, at 
84 percent of the levels of large companies, translating to a productivity gap of only 16 percent 
(Exhibit 5). In general, the productivity gap is larger in emerging economies than advanced ones. 

As discussed in the previous chapter, within increasing income levels in emerging economies, 
MSME productivity rises steeply relative to that of large companies, whereas in advanced 
economies, the productivity of large companies rises noticeably.

The size of MSMEs certainly plays a role in their productivity relative to that of large companies. 
Microenterprises trail large companies by a greater margin than do small and medium-size ones 
(Exhibit 6), and microenterprises account for much more employment in the emerging economies 
in our sample. 

Yet in our sample advanced economies, only about 15 percent of the differences in MSME 
productivity among countries can be explained by the mix of micro-, small, and medium-size 
enterprises. The rest of the variation comes from differences in sector mix as well as how MSMEs 
in each country fare at a subsector level. 

The MSME productivity gap—
defined as the distance between 
MSME productivity and that of large 
companies—varies among countries.

Lack of scale matters more to the MSME productivity gap in some  
sectors than in others

Considering the broad sectors of our sample advanced economies, the MSME productivity ratio, 
averaged across economies, ranges from 49 percent in ICT to 104 percent in the administrative 
services sector. In other words, MSMEs in the ICT sector face the largest gap in productivity 
relative to large companies in ICT, while MSMEs in administrative services tend to outperform 
their large peers in productivity. Country-level differences within each sector are greatest in 
mining and utilities, and smallest in manufacturing and ICT (Exhibit 7). 

Larger scale is generally associated with higher productivity. Yet being small has its advantages, 
too. Small businesses can be a vehicle for individuals to channel their entrepreneurial ambitions

as well as for people who simply own and run a business for a living.19 They shape our social 
fabric and day-to-day life in important ways and are trusted by citizens. In the United States, for 
example, MSMEs are considered the most trusted institutions by the general public, more even 
than the military or the police.20 While small businesses do not have as much time and resources 
to innovate as large companies, their relative advantage comes from being closer to customers, 
being less bureaucratic, and reacting nimbly to changing market dynamics.21 They are able to 
effectively mobilize local labor and offer flexible work arrangements. 

Small businesses also play a crucial role in enabling the productivity of large companies, 
which tend to focus on core competencies and outsource less essential activities to other 
businesses, a phenomenon called work fissuring.22 This results in greater concentration of 
higher-value-added activities in large companies, with smaller businesses taking on lower-
value work. Similarly, in many advanced economies, as waves of labor-intensive manufacturing 
moved to countries with low labor costs—often to MSMEs in those countries—higher-value 
work remained with larger enterprises. 

Moreover, being engaged in higher-value work enables large businesses to build three types of 
competencies: intangible capital, which comprises both better technology and superior human 
capital; global connections; and financial capital. Consequently, the MSME productivity ratio 

16

significant role in driving business competitiveness (Exhibit 8). 

 — Intangible capital. In sectors like ICT, manufacturing, and professional services, intangibles 
drive a larger share of value added and MSMEs have a wider productivity gap. Manufacturing 
productivity depends on organizational efficiency, the application of technology, and the 
effective utilization of capital—areas where scale makes a difference. In the mining sector, 
large companies have an advantage in undertaking explorations because they can invest 
effectively in acquiring geological information and in developing specialized know-how. In 
the ICT and professional services sectors, productivity drivers like automation, connectivity, 
and access to high-skill talent also become more powerful with scale. According to the World 
Bank Enterprise Surveys conducted between 2013 and 2022 and the OECD ICT Access 
and Usage by Businesses database, these are areas where MSMEs struggle.23 The share 
of MSMEs that adopt technologies like customer relationship management systems and 
artificial intelligence is only half the share of large companies. Large companies are twice 
as likely to provide formal skilling programs and are more active in monitoring performance 
and awarding performance bonuses. Large enterprises also contributed to 84 percent of

times as much as small businesses.24

In sectors where intangibles matter less to competitiveness, the MSME productivity gap 
tends to be narrower. In such sectors, companies drive productivity through local reach and 
access to lower-skill labor. Examples are accommodation and food services, administration 
and support services, trade, and transportation.

 — Global connections. In sectors like manufacturing and mining where exports drive a larger 
share of value added, MSMEs have a wider productivity gap with large companies. In trade, 
however, MSMEs actively participate in cross-border activities, likely driven by commodity 
brokering in wholesale trade. This translates into a 70 percent share for MSMEs in all trade 
exports and a higher MSME productivity ratio.

MSMEs are typically less able than larger companies to gain access to global markets and 
benefit from global procurement. According to the World Bank Enterprise Survey, MSMEs 
derive just 5.0 percent of their total sales from direct exports, but large enterprises triple that. 
In emerging economies, on average, MSMEs account for 2.5 percent or less of exports.25 In 
Indonesia, for instance, only 1.5 percent of small enterprises and 10.0 percent of medium-size 
enterprises participate in global value chains, compared with more than one-quarter of all 
large companies.26 Moreover, only about one-fifth of purchases of material inputs by MSMEs 
were of foreign origin, compared with more than one-third for large companies. 

 — Financial capital. Access to finance is the second most cited obstacle for MSMEs 
in the World Bank Enterprise Survey. In sectors like manufacturing, other services, 
transportation, construction, and trade, where businesses typically rely more on traditional 
financing such as bank loans to secure working capital, MSMEs have a wider productivity 
gap. When the sector as a whole relies less on bank financing—perhaps because it is less 
necessary, as is the case in ICT—this may create a more level playing field, resulting in 
relatively smaller productivity gaps.

In addition to these competencies, small businesses may be disproportionately affected 
by lack of public infrastructure, such as reliable logistics networks, access to basic utilities 
like uninterrupted power supply, and the availability of 5G. Large businesses often have the 
ability to establish their operations in areas with robust infrastructure. They also can develop 
infrastructure themselves, such as investing in power generators and building last-mile 
connectivity. While this enabler is critical for MSMEs overall, it is difficult to differentiate at the 
sector level. 

Narrowing the productivity gap is equivalent to 5 to 10 percent of GDP

The tremendous variation in MSME productivity ratios across countries indicates potential for 
improvement. In any given country, overall productivity stands to gain when the ratio of MSME 
productivity to large company productivity is brought closer to its full potential. 

That potential varies by country given different underlying economic conditions. It depends 
on the industry structure in each business domain, as well as the specific nature of existing 
bottlenecks to growth, and the extent to which they are addressed to achieve the optimal 
economic structure. The productivity improvement itself may manifest in various ways. It could 
stem from some MSMEs increasing their productivity while remaining in their size bracket. Or it 
could result from a shift in the industry structure in which some small firms transition within the 
MSME category from micro to small or small to medium, or scale up to become large companies. 

While meaningful benchmarks would vary based on local conditions, we compare the average 
ratio of MSME productivity to that of large companies in each country with the top quartile 
ratio across countries at a subsector level (see sidebar “Estimating the value of narrowing the 

18

A microscope on small businessesEstimating the value of narrowing the productivity gap

To assess the value for each country, we 
compare the ratio of MSME productivity to 
large company productivity in the country 
in each subsector to a benchmark level 
in the same subsector. We considered 
three benchmarks—a higher threshold 
representing the top quartile, a midpoint 
threshold representing the median, and a 
lower threshold representing the bottom 
quartile among all advanced economies. 
We assumed no change in subsectors in 
countries that have already achieved the 
benchmark levels. 

As an illustration, the MSME productivity 
ratio in the manufacturing of food 
products subsector varies from 46 
percent in the United States to 88 percent 

in the United Kingdom. In addition to the 
United Kingdom, Israel and Spain are in 
the top quartile of advanced economies. 
The value of narrowing the productivity 
gap in this case is the difference between 
the actual productivity ratio and the top-
quartile threshold of 61 percent. 

As MSME productivity improves, the 
interlinked economics of small and 
large firms may create feedback loops, 
altering its overall economic impact. 
While we recognize that increasing MSME 
productivity could have multiplier effects 
on the broader economy, estimating  
those effects is more challenging. 
Therefore, we focus only on estimating  
the first-order effects. 

We estimated the value only in 
accommodation and food services, 
administrative services, construction,  
ICT, manufacturing, mining, other  
personal services, professional services, 
trade, transportation and storage, and 
utilities. We excluded other sectors, 
including agriculture, financial services, 
and real estate, because of inconsistent 
data that make it difficult to compare 
across countries. We also excluded 
self-employed individuals—who are 
often sustenance workers in emerging 
economies—in order to be able to compare 
the remaining MSMEs in emerging 
economies with those in advanced 
economies using the same benchmarks.1

1  By not considering self-employed workers, who are more prevalent in emerging economies, we establish a lower benchmark for these countries. To be conservative, we 

chose this approach instead of adjusting the benchmarks for each country based on their per capita GDP.

productivity gap” for an overview of our approach). This exercise is a useful thought experiment 
to motivate an investigation of the specific drivers of MSME productivity and where to focus.

The gap between the actual productivity ratio and the top quartile level is equivalent to an 
average of 5 percent of GDP in advanced economies and an average of 10 percent in emerging 
economies. It ranges from 2 percent in Israel and the United Kingdom to 10 percent in Japan 
among advanced economies, and from 3 percent in Brazil to 15 percent in Indonesia and 
Kenya among emerging economies (Exhibit 9). On a per business worker basis, the amount 
is meaningful, ranging from about $3,000 in Israel to $12,900 in Japan among advanced 
economies, and from $3,200 in Mexico to $8,800 in Indonesia among emerging economies (all 
in purchasing power parity terms).

If we used lower thresholds to set benchmarks, the gap is lower, but still meaningful. For example, 
comparing the current MSME productivity ratio against the median ratio in each subsector, it is 
equivalent to 2 percent of GDP in advanced economies on average and 8 percent in emerging 
economies. Using bottom-quartile benchmarks, it would be about 1 percent of GDP on average 
in advanced economies and 7 percent in emerging economies.

Among advanced economies, the impact of narrowing the gap is larger in Italy, Japan, Poland, 
and the United States. In Japan, two-fifths of all MSME value added is in manufacturing 
and construction where, in many subsectors, MSMEs achieve only the bottom quartile of 
performance across countries. Similarly, in Italy and Poland, MSMEs in two-fifths of subsectors 
are in the bottom quartile of performance. In automotive trade, for instance, Poland has the 
highest productivity gap (73 percent) and Italy the second highest (67 percent) of our sample 
advanced economies. In the United States, MSMEs in almost half the subsectors are in the 
bottom quartile of the productivity ratio.

1To measure value of narrowing the productivity gaps for each country, we assumed that the productivity ratio of MSMEs in the country in each subsector 
reaches a benchmark level (top quartile among all advanced economies, capped at 100%) in the same subsector. We assumed no change in subsectors in 
countries that have already achieved the benchmark levels. We exclude self-employed workers in this calculation.

Where the overall gaps are smaller, as in Israel and the United Kingdom, the impact is limited. In 
these countries, about half the subsectors are already in the top quartile of MSME productivity 
relative to large companies.

The value is highest in four emerging economies—Kenya, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria—where 
MSME productivity gaps are the most substantial. In Kenya, the productivity of small businesses 
is the lowest of all the sample countries, explaining the wide gap. In Indonesia, the productivity 
of large companies is double that of the figure for other emerging economies, and therefore its 
MSMEs have further to go.

The sectors that produce the most economic output account for the largest share of GDP from 
improving their MSME productivity ratios. The three largest are trade, manufacturing, and 
construction (Exhibit 10). Nevertheless, some sectors in some countries punch above their 
weight relative to their role in economies. A standout example is ICT, particularly—in order of 
importance—in India, Nigeria, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, and the United States. In 
these countries, the ICT sector contributes about 8 percent of economic value added on average, 
but about one-fifth of the value from narrowing the productivity gap. Other examples include

3. Looking through a 
microscope to fill the gaps 

To move the needle beyond broad-brush solutions, we need to look in detail at variations in 
relative MSME productivity performance to identify specific opportunities to achieve potential 
additional value. Consistent with MGI’s micro-to-macro analytical approach, we have looked at 
MSME productivity through a microscope, homing in on 68 level-two subsectors and 219 level-
three subsectors. See the technical appendix for details of each of the 16 countries in our sample.

A granular approach helps prioritize where 
to act to boost MSME productivity

MSME productivity ratios vary across sectors, but the spread is even wider at the subsector level 
(Exhibit 11). For instance, in Germany’s sectors, ratios range from 55 percent in manufacturing to 
about 100 percent in transportation. In subsectors, the range is even wider. The spread is largest 
in administrative services, where the ratio is about 20 percent in rental and leasing activities 
and about 120 percent in building services and landscaping activities. There is a wide range in 
manufacturing, too. Small businesses engaged in the manufacture of tobacco products are only 
35 percent as productive as larger counterparts, while those manufacturing basic metals are 
85 percent as productive. In transportation, MSMEs engaged in postal and courier activities are 
less productive than large companies, while in warehousing, they are closely matched.

MSME productivity ratios vary  
across sectors, but the spread is even  
wider at the subsector level.

This granular view at the subsector level is important when setting aspirations for, and thinking 
about ways to boost, MSME productivity. No single country can be considered the north star for 
all MSME productivity. The truth is that the best-performing MSMEs are found in one country for 
one type of activity, but in another country for another type of activity. 

The trade sector illustrates this (Exhibit 12). In automotive trade, Japan’s MSMEs are more 
vertically integrated with large manufacturers than in many other advanced economies, 
including the United States (see chapter 5). This enables them to have more efficient logistics 
that follow just-in-time principles and respond effectively to market fluctuations, making them 
top-quartile performers.27 However, in retail and wholesale trade (excluding automotive trade), 
vertical integration among Japanese MSMEs appears to be weaker, and they fall into the bottom 
two quartiles of relative performance. In these sectors, the United Kingdom and Germany, 
respectively, present compelling benchmarks for Japan.

Viewing MSMEs at a fine-grained level brings high-value subsectors into sharp focus. 
Considering manufacturing, for example, in almost all countries eight sizable subsectors (out 
of 24) account for more than 60 percent of the value from narrowing productivity gaps.28 In 
advanced economies, this ranges between five and 11 subsectors, while in emerging economies, 
the opportunity is more concentrated in four to eight subsectors.

While the sector overall contributes 18 percent of total value from narrowing productivity gaps in 
advanced economies and 25 percent in emerging economies, the opportunity is not uniform—the 
subsectors that offer the largest opportunities differ depending on the country (Exhibit 13). For 
instance, if we compare Indonesia and Australia, there are important differences. Manufacturing 
of basic metals, chemicals, rubbers and plastics, and food products are important sources of 
value in both economies. But in Indonesia, the apparel manufacturing subsector appears to 
offer meaningful value, whereas in Australia the textiles subsector is a sizable opportunity. For 
Indonesia, electrical equipment and automotive manufacturing would be higher priorities, but in 
Australia the comparable subsectors would be machinery and equipment, and fabricated metal. 

Looking through the microscope also helps to tailor efforts to build  
MSME competencies 

The importance of scale for productivity and the hurdles that stand in the way of MSMEs 
gaining that scale are well recognized. So, too, are ways to address this issue, such as building 
national infrastructure and providing access to markets, finance, and technology. But national-
level action is only one aspect of the competencies that MSMEs require to thrive and raise  
their productivity.

1To measure value of narrowing the productivity gaps for each country, we assumed that the productivity ratio of MSMEs in the country in each subsector reach-
es a benchmark level (top quartile among all advanced economies, capped at 100%) in the same subsector. We assumed no change in subsectors in countries 
that have already achieved the benchmark levels. We exclude self-employed workers in this calculation.
Note: Countries ordered by increasing value of narrowing productivity gaps.

Global Market Intelligence; McKinsey Global Institute analysis

Which competencies matter most can vary depending on the type of MSME. For example, 
drawing on the World Bank Enterprise Survey, we find that more than one-third of MSMEs in the 
apparel manufacturing subsector report an “inadequately educated workforce” as their biggest 
obstacle to operations, but less than 15 percent in chemicals manufacturing do so. Because the 
business needs and hurdles to creating value are somewhat different in each subsector, solutions 
need to be tailored to local business and industrial contexts. 

Take US construction as an example. This sector has one of the highest potentials for adding 
value because MSMEs perform poorly on productivity relative to large companies, at 46 percent 
against the top-quartile level of 60 percent in Germany. Large companies in the building 
construction subsector tend to concentrate on residential and nonresidential construction 
projects that typically involve larger projects, greater standardization, modular construction 
methods, and advanced technology and equipment—all of which help to boost productivity. 

26

A microscope on small businessesHowever, MSMEs in the building construction subsector tend to focus on small-scale residential 
construction and refurbishments. They are subject to comprehensive building codes, 
regulations, and standards governed by local and state laws—factors that make it challenging for 
MSMEs to achieve higher productivity. This degree of stratification is not present in all countries 
in this sector. In the United Kingdom, for example, construction MSMEs receive incentives 
to participate in projects similar to those undertaken by large companies and are much more 
productive, relative to large companies, than their counterparts in the United States. Residential 
construction MSMEs in the United States could potentially diversify by becoming subcontractors 
to major players, helping them tap into potential additional value.  

Because the business needs and 
hurdles to creating value are 
somewhat different in each subsector, 
solutions need to be tailored to local 
business and industrial contexts.

4. Creating value through 
networks and interactions

No MSME operates in a vacuum. Its prospects are shaped by its interactions with other 
companies. These interactions can be mutually beneficial, creating a “win-win” for businesses 
small and large. When the economic fabric surrounding companies of all sizes enables  
them to interact productively with one another and grow, the overall economy attains the 
greatest benefits. 

B2B MSMEs tend to be more productive than B2C, suggesting that  
business interactions matter

Business-to-business (or B2B) companies interact closely with other companies, often larger 
ones, as part of their supply chains. In five sectors that account for the largest share of GDP 
from improving their MSME productivity ratio—construction, ICT, manufacturing, trade, and 
transportation—the productivity gap with large companies is narrower for B2B MSMEs than it 
is for business-to-customer (B2C) MSMEs that sell primarily to individuals. In fact, the gap is a 
significant 40 percent narrower on average (Exhibit 14).29

The superior performance of B2B MSMEs can be attributed to both a selection bias, because 
business customers have higher expectations of their providers, and the fact that these MSMEs 
can benefit from lessons learned in the course of working with larger enterprises. Other research 
has also noted how large companies have an incentive to help the smaller businesses they work 
with to become more productive.30 There can, of course, be situations in which large companies 
take advantage of MSMEs, leading to less equitable division of benefits.31

The difference in productivity gaps between B2B and B2C MSMEs is particularly pronounced 
in the transportation and storage sector, where the productivity ratio of B2B MSMEs that 
transport commodities (typically via pipelines) is almost double that of B2C MSMEs, which are 
typically involved in passenger transportation. In the manufacturing sector, B2B MSMEs include 
manufacturers of iron and steel and of locomotives that, on average, have 60 percent of the 
productivity of large companies. In comparison, B2C MSMEs in the sector that, for instance, 
make consumer electronics and jewelry are only 40 percent as productive. 

In the trade sector overall, the difference in the productivity gaps of B2B wholesalers and 
B2C retailers is not large. But in some subsectors, that is not the case. Take the specialized 
trade subsector where stores sell one type of product rather than a wide variety of products 
as nonspecialized supermarkets or department stores do. In this subsector, B2B MSMEs are 
75 percent as productive as large companies operating in the sector—1.2 times higher than 
B2C MSMEs, which are only 63 percent as productive. The advantage in terms of absolute 
productivity is even higher. On average, B2B specialized trade MSMEs are 2.5 times more 
productive than their B2C counterparts. Interestingly, B2B and B2C MSMEs differ not only on 
productivity but also on their dynamism. B2B MSMEs are 1.5 times more likely to have scaled 
up than B2C MSMEs. Twenty percent of large B2B companies were MSMEs two decades ago, 
against 14 percent of B2Cs.

These gaps between B2B and B2C MSMEs reflect different levels of business competencies to 
some extent. Our analysis of the World Bank Enterprise Survey indicates that B2B MSMEs have 
an edge over B2C counterparts on some of the competencies that we discussed earlier, such as 
the following: 

 — B2B MSMEs have a technology and innovation edge. B2B MSMEs are 30 percent  

more likely than B2C MSMEs to have introduced a process innovation in the past three 
years. International quality certifications are also 60 percent more common in B2Bs  
than in B2Cs, perhaps because they are often a requirement when doing businesses with 
large corporations.

 — B2B MSMEs invest more in building human capital than their B2C counterparts. 

B2B MSMEs track performance metrics more often and in more detail than B2C MSMEs. 
They also provide formal training to 60 percent of their employees, compared with about 

30

A microscope on small businesses35 percent of B2C MSMEs. One micro digital marketing agency in the United Kingdom offers 
employees a 20 percent “development time” commitment—for every ten hours worked in a 
week, employees can spend two hours on courses of their choosing.

 — B2B MSMEs are more globally connected. B2B MSMEs derive 6 percent of their revenue 
from direct exports, almost triple the share for B2C MSMEs. B2B e-commerce platforms 
that facilitate exports of products between small manufacturers and wholesalers or even 
offshore software services between companies have become increasingly popular.32 One 
microenterprise launched in 2000 created a platform to enable a transparent and mutually 
beneficial system of centralized MSME purchasing across European countries. 

Large and small companies perform in tandem, and the right  
economic fabric can enable both

MSME interactions with other companies matter, but it is arguably a mistake to view those 
interactions as adversarial, necessitating policies that attempt to create incentives, quotas, or 
protections that tilt the balance toward either small enterprises or larger ones.33 Is this really a 
zero-sum game? The truth—broadly—is that both MSMEs and large companies can benefit when 
they are operating within the right economic fabric. 

We looked at whether large company productivity moves in tandem with that of smaller 
businesses in subsectors (Exhibit 15). In accommodation, for instance, the correlation appears 
strong—the productivity of large and small enterprises moves hand in hand. In Italy, Mexico, 
Poland, Spain, and the United States, both large and small companies tend to outperform the 
average productivity levels of their peers across countries. In Australia, Brazil, Germany, Israel, 
Portugal, and the United Kingdom, both large and small companies tend to underperform their 
respective averages. 

In other subsectors, the correlation is weaker. In advertising and market research, for instance, 
in Indonesia, Japan, and Nigeria, large companies outperform the average cross-country 
productivity while small companies underperform, and vice versa in Australia, Germany, Italy,  
and Spain.

In the vast majority of cases—66 percent, or 45 subsectors—the fortunes of MSMEs and large 
companies go hand in hand.34 This interdependent relationship is even more pronounced in 
manufacturing, where productivity levels of MSMEs and large companies are highly correlated 
(across countries) in about 80 percent of the 24 subsectors analyzed.

Within each subsector, we categorize countries where both large and small companies perform 
better than peers as win-win domains. If only one outperforms while the other lags behind, we 
classify it as either a “large firms outperform” or a “small firms outperform” domain. If both large 
and small firms lag behind their peers, it is considered a “challenged” domain. 

How large is the win-win advantage? In the 45 subsectors where large and small companies are 
closely intertwined, the overall productivity of the win-win domain is $163,000 (in purchasing 
power parity terms). That is 1.5 times higher than in the domains where only small businesses or 
only large businesses outperform. This relationship holds true even for the subsectors in which 
the correlation is weak. 

Other studies corroborate our finding that MSME productivity and large firm productivity are 
interconnected. One analysis of 26 European countries found that a 1.0 percent rise in MSME 
productivity is associated with a 0.124 percent increase in the productivity of large firms. While 
the analysis does not establish a causal relationship, there do appear to be some knowledge 
spillovers through the sharing of ideas, best practices, and even talent.35

5. Seven examples of 
win-win domains

Working closely with thriving large companies is one important route to higher MSME 
productivity, but not the only one. Network effects among small enterprises can help them 
attain competencies associated with scale. While MSMEs do not have significant market power 
because they have limited scale, creation of sector-wide infrastructure and boosting interfirm 
networks and linkages can provide “collective productivity”—the competitive advantage derived 
from local external economies and joint action—and substitute for direct benefits of scale.36

As countries try to reduce concentration and geopolitical risks, they are aiming to realign their 
global manufacturing and services footprints, but for this to happen, MSMEs need to raise their 
productivity game. Without MSMEs getting more productive, it’s hard to imagine a meaningful 
realignment of global production. Industrial policies that aim to create new manufacturing 
capabilities also need to focus on MSMEs in those specific ecosystems. 

To illustrate examples of how win-win domains have been created in some countries, benefiting 
both small and large companies, we looked in detail at examples in the largest sectors for MSME 
value potential (Exhibit 16). Each of these case studies demonstrates how MSMEs have achieved 
high productivity through network effects. 

In manufacturing, we examine the auto sector in Japan and beverages (wine) in Italy; in trade, the 
wholesale trade sector in Germany; in construction, examples from both Australia and the United 
Kingdom; in ICT, US software publishing; and in professional services, Israel’s R&D. Within each 
of these sectors, both MSMEs and large companies in the highlighted country generally exhibit 
higher productivity levels compared with their counterparts in other advanced economies. 
However, this does not necessarily imply that their productivity has increased over time. It is 
possible that they attained high productivity levels in the past and managed to sustain them over 
the years. 

By looking through the microscope at these examples, a clear message emerges: there is no single 
path to success, but rather a range of promising possible approaches. A common characteristic 
of these approaches is their focus on addressing the issue of scale through structural changes, 
enabling MSMEs to become “collectively large” by creating network efficiencies. 

There is no single path to success,  
but rather a range of promising 
possible approaches.

with large companies

On average, MSMEs in auto manufacturing in Japan have double the productivity of MSMEs in 
other advanced economies. This is predominantly because medium-size enterprises have close 
linkages to large companies. Benefits from best practices such as Keiretsu networks and vertical 
integration trickle down to them.37

With the overall credo of “we are all in this together,” large Japanese OEMs have built deep links 
with MSMEs, enabling their operational proficiency, and enhancing technological capabilities 
and access to talent for smaller companies. These deep linkages also extend to financing, with 
large OEMs often having crossover share investments with their MSME partners.38

Toyota is an example of a company that has unusually high integration with its ecosystem 
partners. Some contractual partnerships with suppliers have lasted for more than 30 years. 
Toyota has directly involved itself in raising the operational standards of its partners through 
knowledge transfer, from demand planning and cost reduction to raising management 
capabilities. In the 2000s, Toyota created three cost-reduction programs for its suppliers, in 
combination aiming to reduce costs by 60 percent. While many of Toyota’s MSME partners 
remain reliant on Toyota for more than 70 percent of their revenue, some have developed 
independently.39 These MSMEs share some common traits; they often harness their 
ecosystem partnerships to enhance their technological capabilities and venture into highly 
specialized production.

2. Italian winemaker MSMEs gain global market access through  
collective branding and marketing

Italy’s MSME beverage manufacturing sector—particularly its winemakers—is highly fragmented 
but superproductive. These enterprises are 1.5 times more productive than their counterparts in 
other advanced economies. 

Winemaking typically has some very large players. In the United States, for instance, most 
wine is made by less than 0.5 percent of makers. But Italy’s wine business is dominated by 
small, often family-led enterprises. Fragmentation and a plethora of small players are not 
usually associated with high productivity, but there is a “paradox of scale” in productivity in 
Italy’s wine business.40 Why? 

Italy has created an environment that delivers small players access to branding and marketing. 
The “Made in Italy” campaign has championed traditional and local production, with a 
particular focus on the international market. Italy has more than 500 wines that have Protected 
Designation of Origin or Protected Geographical Indications certifications. Similar designations 
have delivered success elsewhere, for instance in the cases of Alphonso mangos and basmati 
rice in India, and Guadarrama beef in Spain. These are stamps of quality in the eyes of consumers 
and apply to the 42 percent of Italy’s wine production that is exported, enabling small producers 
to charge premium prices and obviating the need to produce at scale. Where they are located 
is a key part of marketing. Layered on top of this is that Italy’s MSME winemakers are highly 
networked with one another through membership of associations or in cooperatives, giving them 
collectively a louder voice. 

3. Construction MSMEs in the United Kingdom profit from better  
access to new markets and finance

In the United Kingdom, construction sector productivity has stagnated over time.41 But small 
businesses exhibit higher productivity than those in our other sample countries, as policy 
interventions in the United Kingdom have boosted their ability to respond to burgeoning demand. 
UK policy makers simplified procurement processes, reduced bidding costs, and accelerated

for government contracts on a broadly equal footing.42 The government has also, more recently, 
orchestrated demonstrator projects to showcase modern construction methods and to enable 
small businesses to learn from one another.43

Although the impact of these enablers on productivity growth is not fully evident yet, they seem 
to have triggered a wave of creative collaborations among MSMEs. For instance, Cara EPS 
built a digital platform to bring together specialist retrofitter microenterprises, enabling them 
collectively to undertake substantial contracts leveraging their distinct expertise.44 MSMEs 
need to invest in innovation and technology to compete in the same markets as large companies. 
For ProBuild360, this involved developing capabilities in modern methods of construction and 
enlisting similar-sized MSMEs not only as suppliers but also as mentors to assist in the adoption 
of new techniques and materials. This enabled the company to emerge as a key building partner 
for social housing authorities.45

4. Construction MSMEs in Australia gain from subcontracting for  
larger companies and access to skilled workers

In specialized construction, particularly in the mining sector, Australia’s large players have 
higher productivity than those in our other sample countries, and MSMEs the second highest 
among their peers. This is attributable to collaborations between large and smaller players 
that have developed partly due to the country’s remoteness and climatic extremes, and partly 
due to effective public policies that encourage partnerships and facilitate a robust system of 
mutual cooperation.

MSMEs specialize in niche construction projects that are more often subcontracted than in other 
countries. Australia has one of the highest shares of public–private partnership construction 
projects in the world.46 The government has reduced red tape, cutting the number of regulatory 
procedures from 14 to ten and the average time it takes to approve permits from 150 days to 112.47 
Skills building has also been a priority. Construction workers go through rigorous certification 
and licensing processes and benefit from a national system of vocational education and training, 
formal apprenticeship programs, and industry-led initiatives, such as Construction Skills 
Queensland.48

5. Germany’s wholesale trade MSMEs benefit from vertical integration 
with European manufacturers and strong logistics infrastructure

Germany’s MSME wholesalers are 1.3 times more productive than the average among advanced 
economies in our sample and are more productive even when excluding commodity traders. 
They are able to tap into global markets through the European single market, which is further 
bolstered by Germany’s central location, contributing to their productivity. They also benefit 
from Germany’s industry-wide logistics backbone, which is reinforced by a range of benefits 
conferred by free trade port zones, including tax reductions for imports and reexports, and 
simplified customs regulations. 

German wholesalers are also among the most innovative in Europe.49 These enterprises 
gain spillover benefits from being part of a larger ecosystem. They often operate as legally 
independent affiliates or subsidiaries that are vertically integrated with upstream purchasers for 
retail supermarkets or distributors for large manufacturers for the entire European Union.50 An 
example is Coffee Friend, a medium-size wholesaler of coffee makers that mediates transactions 
for several manufacturers based in Europe.51

by industry giants

In the dynamic US software publishing business, MSMEs are 1.7 times more productive on 
average than those in the same sector in other advanced economies. MSMEs gain from talent 
and capital ecosystems seeded by successful large companies. Large companies serve as 
reputational anchors, delivering market access and branding. A virtuous cycle of robust capital 
ecosystems and the agglomeration of a strong talent pool have enabled the growth of large 
businesses and continue to support the growth of MSMEs in this sector.

MSMEs in this sector are highly innovative and internationally minded. Small technology firms 
have patented more per employee than their large counterparts.52 Tech startups are also often 
seen as “born global” because they create products and services for a global market.53 Almost 
half of all US ICT MSMEs were engaged in international trade as long ago as 2007.54

Large companies in the sector are important clients, frequent buyers, and potential partners, 
and multiple connections mean that MSMEs are able to leverage a larger pool of resources and 
experience, including talent and capital.

7. Israel stands out for its ability to connect different stakeholders  
engaged in scientific R&D

The productivity of MSMEs in Israel’s scientific R&D subsector is almost double that of those in 
other advanced economies in our sample.55 Israel is a unique economy that ranks high among 
the world’s economies on the quality of its research organizations. The government has long 
been committed to promoting innovation and R&D, and has helped forge strong links between 
companies large and small, academia, and venture capitalists.

The close proximity of businesses, research institutions, and venture capital firms in cities 
such as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv facilitates collaboration and networking. Universities actively 
encourage researchers to work on projects with commercial potential. Ties between academia 
and the private sector are strong, encouraged by the government setting up technology transfer 
offices to facilitate the process of licensing technologies to industry partners and creating 
startups based on the research undertaken. These close ties are particularly vital because Israel 
focuses on highly technical (and highly regulated) innovation, such as biotech, health tech, and 
pharmaceuticals. The Israeli venture capital industry has also thrived since the 1990s with help 
from governmental programs such as Yozma, which offered incentives to foreign companies 
willing to back Israeli startups.

The productivity of MSMEs in 
Israel’s scientific R&D subsector is 
almost double that of those in other 
advanced economies in our sample.

6. Delivering a win-win future

Productivity is a hot-button issue for economies navigating particularly turbulent times. 
Indeed, accelerating productivity growth may be the only route out of current financial stress, 
reconfiguring global trade patterns, and shifts in companies’ manufacturing and services 
footprint to build resilience that delivers rising wealth and robust growth in GDP and incomes.56

This research indicates that narrowing the MSME productivity gap with large companies can 
yield considerable value, and that large companies, policy makers, and MSMEs themselves can 
contribute to capturing that value by acquiring key competencies. 

Improving the productivity of small businesses merits immediate attention. It may be a self-
resolving issue—a natural progression as employment shifts to larger enterprises as economies 
develop. As discussed, this progression can play out in different ways. Some MSMEs may scale 
into larger companies, others may be acquired by larger enterprises, and some may cease 
operations and make room for new businesses. Indeed, previous MGI research suggests that 
high-growth emerging economies tend to be the ones where large companies are allowed 
to scale rapidly.57 However, the extent of this natural progression is limited. Even in the most 
advanced economies, MSMEs continue to contribute the majority of all workers employed by 
businesses. Change is also likely to be slow. The clear implication is that, overall, MSMEs will 
continue to play an important role in the long term, and that acting now to boost their productivity 
growth can make the difference to economy-wide growth.

But given the enormous variation in productivity performance evident at the subsector level and 
even among enterprises with different business models, getting the conditions right for raising 
productivity requires a microscopic view to help prioritize, design, and implement solutions. 

Three considerations can help shape stakeholder actions

Even with an abundance of initiatives and examples of efforts that stakeholders can make, 
understanding how to capture the MSME productivity opportunity is a complex exercise. 
Opportunities vary a great deal on the ground, and there are few one-size-fits-all solutions. 
Intentional measures targeted at helping small enterprises may even raise questions about how 
this might affect the overall productivity of economies. We suggest three considerations for 
stakeholders as they develop their approaches. 

Creating a win-win economic fabric is important
The global business landscape is deeply interconnected. The success or failure of large 
companies can have ripple effects throughout entire economic ecosystems. As such, 
stakeholders, including policy makers, regulatory bodies, associations, and large companies 
need to foster the right enabling conditions for the growth and prosperity of all enterprises. 
These conditions may require measures that go beyond conventional policies focused  
on MSMEs, such as facilitating access to credit for MSMEs and encouraging training  
for MSME employees. In addition to such measures, it may involve strategies to build 
“collective productivity.” 

Strengthening networks and interactions between large and small businesses can yield 
productivity gains in the win-win domains and in domains where large companies outperform 
their peers but smaller ones lag behind. Where small businesses outperform while larger ones do 
not, there would be benefit in enabling those small enterprises to evolve into large ones or merge 
with them to promote business dynamism. When both large and small companies lag behind 
their peers, more fundamental steps to improve the economic fabric as a whole may be needed; 
for instance, investing in physical and digital infrastructure, establishing transparent and fair 

40

A microscope on small businessesregulatory frameworks that boost competition, reducing trade barriers, and ensuring equal 
access to financial capital.

Prioritization can pay off
Stakeholders first need to decide which economic domains to focus on to make MSMEs more 
productive. Failing to prioritize which opportunities to pursue can lead to a dilution of efforts 
and place a burden on the often-limited resources at hand. Some countries have selected and 
supported “national champion” sectors, as has happened with beverage manufacturing in Italy, 
automotive manufacturing in Japan, and R&D in Israel. Such prioritization requires meticulous 
identification of the nation’s competitive advantages and a keen eye for demand trends, as 
well as allocating resources toward innovation, facilitating access to capital, and cultivating 
supportive networks.

A granular and tailored approach matters
Measures designed to help MSMEs improve their performance tend to be broad, but the granular 
lens of this research reveals that different subsectors have varied needs. Stakeholders may 
need to design a menu of measures for each prioritized opportunity.58 In other words, taking 
a microscopic approach that reflects the dynamics of each subsector and country and that 
addresses barriers to productivity and scale in that context is warranted. 

All stakeholders can boost MSME competencies through a variety  
of proven approaches

All stakeholders—policy makers, large companies, and MSMEs themselves—can adopt 
strategies designed to boost productivity, which may involve structural changes that go beyond 
traditional approaches. Policy makers can provide access to better infrastructure, while large 
companies can help MSMEs build scale-related competencies. MSMEs can collaborate with 
others to achieve network efficiencies.

Policy makers can boost access to technology, new markets, and finance
Supportive policy interventions can create advantages of scale for MSMEs and help overall 
business dynamism. The following three broad contributions stand out: 

 — Being intentional in improving technology access and building management skills of 

businesses. Singapore’s GoBusiness initiative provides financial support for all businesses 
that adopt technology solutions to improve their business processes, aligned to industry road 
maps.59 Governments can also make direct investments in digital infrastructure that help 
businesses expand their market reach. For example, in India, the Open Network for Digital 
Commerce aims to build an e-commerce platform, which can particularly assist small retailers 
reach new consumers because they lack the resources and financial capacity to develop 
their own platforms.60 The Help to Grow program in the United Kingdom aims to help small 
businesses scale up by offering management courses taught by entrepreneurs and industry 
experts to develop leadership skills and establish business networks.61

 — Opening up access to new markets. One example is Europe’s “Small Business, Big World” 
initiative, which offers guidance on customs procedures, trade regulations, and market 
entry requirements in various countries to enable SMEs to expand their export activities.62 
Canada’s CanExport program supports MSMEs in exploring new export opportunities, 
enabling them to participate in trade shows, conduct market research, and develop 
marketing materials for the international market.63

 — Boosting financial infrastructure that helps underfinanced MSMEs. An open data 

framework, for instance, can enable financial institutions to use nontraditional data sources 
for credit underwriting, targeted at a range of underfinanced companies including MSMEs. 
An Experian study showed that including utility data allowed 20 percent of “thin-file” credit 
customers with scant documentation to support their credit application to become “thick-

file” customers who have higher loan approval rates.64 For small businesses, this can increase 
access to financing, provide greater convenience, and improve product options.65 Financial 
institutions could also benefit from efficiency improvements, better fraud prediction, and 
reduced friction and cost of data intermediation. Governments can also help businesses 
improve their working capital management by improving tax-related infrastructure and 
systems. In Latin America, countries such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru have launched 
initiatives aimed at radically simplifying business registration and tax payment processes. 
One reform enabled businesses to formally register in a day.66

In addition to these interventions, policy makers can also facilitate the availability of globally 
consistent yet granular data to enable all stakeholders to take a microscopic approach to 
understanding and thereby improving the productivity of MSMEs.

Large companies can boost the competencies of MSMEs within their value chains 
As discussed earlier in this report, networks and linkages between MSMEs and large companies 
benefit the growth and performance of both. One study of small businesses in New York found 
that seven out of ten of them increased their revenue within two years of becoming part of a 
corporate supplier base.67 A 2023 study of Belgian companies found that when MSMEs started 
supplying superstar companies for the first time, their productivity increased by about 8 percent 
after four years. They also achieved an increase in sales to businesses other than the new 
superstar partner.68

But it is not a one-way street. As noted earlier, large companies also appear to benefit when their 
MSME partners and suppliers are more productive. This could be because large companies often 
depend on MSMEs in most parts of the value chain, from development to supply, production, 
service delivery, distribution, and sales and post-sales. For example, a large logistics player 
works with local delivery partners for last-mile delivery, and a small recruiting agency might help 
a large company fill key positions. Large companies therefore had an incentive to raise MSME 
capabilities. The following three ways are pivotal: 

 — Assisting MSME partners to build digital and R&D capabilities. Unilever’s open innovation 
platform Foundry connects its different divisions with startups to engage in joint ideation and 
mentorship opportunities, for instance.69 Google helps small businesses that purchase ad 
placements from it in gaining a deeper understanding of customer behavior and in improving 
the utilization and efficiency of ad spaces.70 In India, Maruti Suzuki set up a “comprehensive 
excellence” program for its main MSME suppliers. In 2018–19, 50 percent of the company’s 
suppliers met the performance standards laid out and reported improved efficiency, more 
interest from investors, and broader access to procurement and R&D opportunities.71 
Nestlé’s Nescafe Plan has provided training to small coffee farmers for techniques to 
increase crop yields.72

 — Conferring MSME partners with an ability to build workforce capabilities. One example 
is Apple, which launched a $50 million fund in collaboration with the International Labour 
Organization and the International Organization for Migration to provide learning and skills 
development opportunities for the employees of its suppliers.73 In India, Walmart launched 
a Supplier Development Program to train and prepare 50,000 small businesses to better 
integrate into global supply chains.74

 — Lending weight to the reputation of MSMEs when requesting finance. For example, 

DuPont leveraged its relationship with a financial institution to secure working capital credit 
for its MSME suppliers in rural areas, thereby strengthening its supply chain and increasing 
sales.75 Large financial institutions have a particularly important role in providing affordable 
credit and better product options to MSMEs. Innovative underwriting approaches that 
use alternative credit data can help; an Experian survey found that 70 percent of small 
businesses are willing to furnish additional financial information if it will improve the chances 
of loan approval or reduce borrowing rates.76

42

A microscope on small businessesMSMEs can collaborate with one another to achieve network efficiencies
Collaboration among MSMEs can help build their capabilities. In Europe, for instance, 30 to 
40 percent of SMEs do not belong to any formal network, but can still forge collaborations.77 That 
collaboration can even be at the level of individual MSMEs. Innovative companies cooperate on 
business activities with other organizations more than those that are not innovative.78 One OECD 
study of SMEs operating in Association of Southeast Asian Nations economies found that they 
perform better when they are allied with large enterprises, but also when they strike partnerships 
with other MSMEs.79 Japan’s Small and Medium Enterprise Agency has shown that SMEs that 
have partnered with other small enterprises in order to implement technology solutions in their 
operations have 76 percent more sales per employee than those that haven’t taken this route.80 
For example, a small sheet-metal processor in Japan wanted to incorporate in-house cloud 
computing into its operations and partnered with two other enterprises in the same sector, but 
with different specialties. Together, the three companies built a joint order reception system, 
which enables them to collaborate on a range of projects with the same clients. All three MSMEs 
improved the digital and management capabilities of their manufacturing operations.81

Broader MSME collaborations at the association or group level can help more small businesses 
raise productivity through knowledge sharing, mentoring, networking, and online platforms. The 
SME Finance Forum works with more than 240 active member institutions—financial institutions, 
technology companies, development finance institutions, and relevant large corporations—to 
facilitate resources to help MSMEs bridge their financial access gap.82 The DIGITAL SME Alliance 
in Europe launched a platform for traditional SMEs to access a catalog of digital solutions 
ranging from videoconferencing to AI modeling.83

Other companies can also facilitate the creation of such MSME networks. For example, IBM, in 
collaboration with other Fortune 500 companies, launched a Supplier Connection initiative that 
connects small suppliers to one another and to large businesses to access new opportunities.84 
SABI, an African digital infrastructure provider, fosters connections between MSME merchants, 
wholesalers, distributors, and manufacturers. It also provides them with enterprise resource 
planning tools, B2B commerce interfaces, and financial services, enabling MSMEs to reach new 
customers, improve their cash flow, and streamline their logistics.85

Raising productivity is, and always has been, the optimal route to healthier incomes and business 
resilience. In a world beset by uncertainty amid geopolitical tensions and shifts in manufacturing 
and services footprints, raising the game of the world’s MSMEs—which are so central to jobs, 
livelihoods, value creation, and economic growth—is a priority. The potential is large, but 
efforts to capture it need to be thoughtful and very likely targeted. Only by having a granular 
understanding of MSME productivity can effective action be taken. That action can create a win-
win for all companies, small and large.

17  The low productivity challenges 
of microenterprises in emerging 
economies could be linked to 
informality. According to the World 
Bank, almost 80 percent of all 
MSMEs in emerging economies are 
informal. These businesses typically 
have limited access to markets, 
finance, and government support, 
restricting their productivity. We 
estimate that informal employment 
in our sample emerging economies 
is only one-quarter to one-fifth as 
productive as formal employment.
